Most of the beaches werereopened on Saturday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The heat wave in much of the country ispushing up concentrations of ozone, a major air pollutant, over bigcities to levels sometimes not seen for a decade.   ``We are having an absolutely horrendous summer,'' commentedBill Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial AirPollution Program Administrators Association, on Friday.   Ozone prompted air pollution advisories in Chicago every daylast week and caused standards to be violated in Vermont for thefirst time in recent memory.   Several states and cities warned people with lung problems tocurtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon. New Yorkhad a statewide advisory on Friday.   The new peaks come at a time when the Environmental ProtectionAgency is considering whether new ozone standards are neededbecause of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Democrats will convene in Atlanta next week in a spirit of unityand optimism unseen in a dozen years, assuming that Michael Dukakiscan find a way to have Jesse Jackson on his side without placinghim on the ticket.   As the Democrats' 1988 nominee-in-waiting, the 54-year-oldDukakis unquestionably will command center stage in the conventioncity in the heart of Dixie.   And a southern-style political coronation it will be for the manfrom New England, from the convention site itself to the selectionof a Texas Treasurer Ann Richards as keynote speaker and thedecision to have Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton place Dukakis' name innomination a week from Wednesday night.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Because he is vice president as well as thecertain Republican presidential nominee, George Bush must contendwith twin staffs. And insiders say the two sometimes-feudingfactions have produced an ongoing tug-of-war over policy.   A sharing of responsibility for Bush's daily activity betweenchief of staff Craig Fuller and campaign manager Lee Atwater iscausing tensions within the Bush operation, according to campaignofficials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   And while Bush has a committee of six trusted advisers tooversee the broad strokes of his campaign, advisers claim that turfbattles are likely to continue until the vacant seat at the end ofthe table is occupied.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney General Edwin Meese III was ``closelyinvolved'' in discussions about a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oilpipeline and gave conflicting accounts about whether he knew of analleged bribery scheme connected with the project, according to anindependent counsel's report.   The sealed report, portions of which were obtained by The NewYork Times, also calls ``highly unusual'' Meese's 1985 call to theWhite House about the pipeline, and reveals that a sensitive memodiscussing financial guarantees for the project is missing fromMeese's files.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of this southern Indiana farmingtown offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that werefound beneath bridges, behind businesses and two historic buildings.   The bombs were defective and failed to detonate, but the thoughtof what might have happened has made an impact on the town of 6,000.   Patrons at Donanna's Restaurant kidded each other Friday aboutthe 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blastingcaps.   ``They'll look under a chair and say `Is there a bomb underhere?' and laugh,'' said Forest P. Noland, a manager at therestaurant.   But, says Noland, ``it isn't anything to joke about, really.''   Rewards totaling $10,000 have been offered for information aboutthe explosives. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmsposted the original $5,000 reward Thursday, and the Indiana ArsonCrime Association matched that Friday.</TEXT><DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five months after two American Indians tookhostages at a newspaper to protest local conditions, changes havebeen made to address their concerns, but some say it remains to beseen whether the reforms will bring lasting change.   Others say the real change is that residents of Robeson Countyhave realized ``that they can control their lives.''   ``It's truly cosmetic,'' Eddie Hatcher said last week of thechanges, which include a second superior court judgeship and a taskforce named by Gov. Jim Martin to investigate alleged corruption inthe county.   ``It's nothing more than to douse the fire, hoping it will goout,'' said Hatcher, one of two Lumbee Indian men who entered theoffices of The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1, allegedly armed, inwhat they said was a protest of local corruption and discriminationagainst minorities. The daylong siege ended when the governoragreed to appoint the task force.</TEXT><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shaken by the first schism in the Roman CatholicChurch in more than a century, the Vatican has moved with unusualspeed to try to win back followers of renegade Archbishop MarcelLefebvre.   But it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the82-year-old Frenchman, who consecrated four bishops without papalapproval June 30 and was excommunicated.   Lefebvre contends the Vatican has broken with true Catholicismby adopting Mass in languages other than Latin and by taking othermodernist steps.   Within days of Lefebvre's defiant act, the Vatican firmly statedthat it would not tolerate Lefebvre sympathizers, but it made clearthat it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the Roman CatholicChurch rather than follow Lefebvre out of it.</TEXT></DOC>
