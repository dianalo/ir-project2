Profit for the maker of automotive and industrial parts slipped to $31 million from $34.3 million a year earlier. Even so, earnings were slightly better than the company and analysts had expected. Dana also predicted higher earnings for the second quarter.    Per-share profit increased to 69 cents from 65 cents, as the number of shares outstanding dropped to 44.7 million from 52.6 million because of two share buybacks over the past year.    Sales rose 4.3% to a high of $1 billion from $961.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. In particular, March sales skyrocketed, hitting $371 million. Last month's sales were 10% better than the company's previous record set in October 1985. Sales of replacement parts for cars and trucks grew 5% during the quarter; sales of original car and truck parts grew 10%.    &quot;We expect (sales) to continue at a comparable pace during the second quarter,&quot; said Gerald B. Mitchell, chairman. &quot;With the many ongoing programs to improve margins in our basic business,&quot; he added, &quot;the second quarter promises to be even better for the Dana Corp.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dana closed at $41.50, down $1.75. </TEXT></DOC>
