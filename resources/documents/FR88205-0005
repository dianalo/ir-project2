If the Board determines that a state-requireddisclosure is inconsistent with the Federal law, the state law is preemptedto the extent of the inconsistency and disclosures using the inconsistentterm or form may not be made. The determination regarding Indiana law is issued under authority delegatedto the Director of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, as setforth in the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12 CFR 265.2(h)(3)).Preemption determinations have an effective date of the October 1 thatfollows the determination by at least six months, as required by section105(d) of the act. As a result, this determination has an effective dateof October 1, 1988, although compliance may begin before that time. (2) <T3>Principles followed in preemption analysis. </T3>In determining whethera state law is inconsistent with Federal provisions, andSection; 226.28(a)(1)of Regulation Z, which implements section 111 of the act, provides thatstate requirements are inconsistent with, and therefore preempted by, theFederal provisions if the state law requires a creditor to make disclosuresor take actions that contradict the requirements of the Federal law. Astate law is contradictory, and therefore preempted, if it significantlyimpedes the operation of the Federal law or interferes with the purposesof the Federal statute. Two examples of contradictory state laws are includedin andSection; 226.28(a)(1). They are (1) a law that requires the use ofthe same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning thanthe Federal law, or (2) a law that requires the use of a term differentfrom the Federal term to describe the same item. The following principles, which were developed in previous preemption determinations(48 FR 4454, February 1, 1983), were applied in making the current determinations:andbullet; For purposes of making preemption determinations, state law isdeemed to require the use of specific terminology in the state disclosuresif the state statute uses certain terminology in the disclosure provision.andbullet; A state disclosure does not ``describe the same item,'' underandSection; 226.28(a)(1), if it is not the functional equivalent of a Federaldisclosure. andbullet; Preemption occurs only in those transactions in which an actualinconsistency exists between the state law and the Federal law. andbullet; A state law is not inconsistent merely because it requires moreinformation than Federal law or requires disclosure in transactions whereFederal law requires none.In general, preemption determinations are limited to those provisions ofstate law identified in the request for a determination, and that is thecase in the present determination. At the Board's discretion, however,other state provisions that may be affected by the Federal law also maybe addressed. (3) <T3>Discussion of specific request and final determination. </T3>The Boardwas asked to examine section 8(d) of the recently amended Indiana ``LoanBroker'' statute, Ind. Code section 23-2-5-1 <T3>et seq., </T3>to determine whether that section of the state law requirescertain disclosures that contradict the disclosures required under section106(a) and andSection; 226.4(a) of the Truth in Lending Act and RegulationZ, respectively. The Board published a proposed determination on September 4, 1987 (52 FR33596). In that proposal, the Board proposed to preempt the state disclosurerequirement in those instances where the state law would call for inconsistentdisclosures. Eight commenters addressed the proposal; commenters includedbanks, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Secretaryof State for the State of Indiana, the Indiana Securities Commissioner,and the Attorney General of Indiana. The majority of comments supportedthe Board's proposal, generally citing the state law's interference withthe intent of the Federal scheme. The officials representing the Stateof Indiana, however, opposed the proposal, questioning the Board's authorityto affect a law directed at a group that is not subject to the Truth inLending Act, namely loan brokers. The final determination regarding theIndiana law at issue, together with the reasons for the Board's action,are set forth below. The relevant provisions of the state statute (which has an effective dateof September 1, 1987) are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">23-2-5-8. <T3>Disclosure statement. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) A loan broker shall deliver to any person who proposes to becomeobligated for a loan an estimated disclosure statement if the creditorwould be required to deliver to the person a disclosure statement underthe Truth-in-Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601-1667e) for the transaction. Theestimated disclosure statement: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) shall be delivered to the person before the person becomes contractuallyobligated on the loan; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) shall be delivered or placed in the mail to the person not laterthan three (3) business days after the person enters into an agreementwith the loan broker;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">whichever occurs first. The estimated disclosure statement must containall of the information and be in the form required by the Truth-in-LendingAct (15 U.S.C. 1601-1667e) and regulations under the Act. However, theannual percentage rate, finance charge, total of payments, and other mattersrequired under the Truth-in-Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601-1667e) shall beadjusted to reflect the amount of all fees and charges of the loan brokerthat the creditor could exclude from a disclosure statement. The disclosurestatement must state at the top in at least 10 point type: ``The followingis an estimated disclosure statement showing your loan transaction as ifthe fees and charges you are scheduled to pay us were charged to you directlyby the creditor.'' After the estimated disclosure statement is deliveredto any person, the loan broker shall deliver to the person an additionalstatement redisclosing all items if the actual annual percentage rate willvary from the annual percentage rate contained in the original estimateddisclosure by more than one-eighth of one percent (0.125%). Any requiredadditional disclosure statement shall be delivered or placed in the mailbefore consummation of the loan or the elapse of three (3) days after theinformation that requires redisclosure becomes available, whichever occursfirst.</ITAG>The requesting party asked for a determination as to whether the requirementimposed by this section that loan brokers reflect all of their fees andcharges in their calculation of, among other items, the finance chargeand annual percentage rate that must be disclosed to potential borrowersis preempted by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. Section 106(a)and andSection; 226.4(a) of the Federal statute and regulation, respectively,state that, in any consumer credit transaction, the finance charge includescharges paid by the consumer that are imposed by the creditor as an incidentto the extension of credit. Under Regulation Z, charges imposed by thirdparties are not finance charges as long as the creditor does not requirethe parties services or retain the charges. Thus, fees charged by a loanbroker are not finance charges provided that the creditor does not requirethe use of the broker. (See Official Staff Commentary, 12 CFR 226.4(a)-3.)Since the state statute requires that loan brokers include their fees incalculating the finance charge and annual percentage rate in cases wherethe creditor would exclude such fees in calculating those same items forthe Federal disclosures, the Board has determined that the state disclosurerequirement is preempted in those instances where the state law would requirethe use of the same term to disclose a different amount than would be disclosedunder Federal law. In such cases, the state disclosure would contradictthe disclosures required under Federal law and interfere with the intentof the Federal scheme.Although the Board, in the past, has made preemption determinations concerninglaws whose coverage may extend to parties who are not considered creditorsfor purposes of Regulation Z (for example, Arizona in 1985 and South Carolinain 1983), the issue is raised directly in this instance. Specifically,one comment letter, representing the views of officials from the Stateof Indiana, questioned whether the Board's preemption authority extendsto a law governing loan brokers, parties who are not subject to the requirementsof the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. Section 111(a)(1) of the Federal act permits the Board to ``annul, alter,or affect the laws of any state relating to the disclosure of informationin connection with credit transactions * * * to the extent that those lawsare inconsistent with the provisions of [the Federal law].'' Although thissection goes on to refer to ``creditors'' who may not make disclosuresusing an inconsistent term or form, the Board does not view this referenceas limiting the scope of its authority to carry out the overall purposeof the Truth in Lending Act. The reference to creditors in this sectionis descriptive of parties who are directly covered by the act's provisions.The Board, however, in considering the impact of a state statute on theoperation of the Federal law, believes that use of this term is not meantto exclude laws concerning other parties or classes of transactions thatmight undermine the purpose of the Federal law. Congress, in granting theBoard broad authority to effectuate the purpose of the Truth in LendingAct, could not have foreseen every group or class of transactions thatmight interfere with this purpose. Because of this, the Board's authorityat times may necessarily affect transactions that the act does not reachon its face, particularly when, as in this case, the state statute effectivelyinterferes with the operation of the Federal scheme. For these reasons,the Board, in reviewing Indiana's statute for its overall effect on thepurpose and operation of the Federal law, does not feel constrained bythe fact that the state law is directed towards loan brokers, a group notitself subject to the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. In this instance, therefore, the Board has determined that, although theparties involved are not ``creditors'' under the Truth in Lending Act,this circumstance does not outweigh the fact that the effect of the statestatute is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of the Federal law, whichis to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring clear, uniform,and meaningful disclosures about its terms and costs. The Board believesthat, in this instance, the approach chosen by the state will underminethe intent of the Federal scheme by confusing consumers who will receivetwo different sets of disclosures_both purporting to describe the costof credit_that contain different figures described by the same terminology.Although the Board recognizes that the state disclosure is meant to informconsumers about costs that they may incur in certain credit transactions,this purpose should not be served in a manner that interferes with theoperation of the Federal scheme. In such cases, where the state law requiresthe use of the same term to disclose a different amount than would be disclosedunder Federal law, the state law clearly contradicts the requirements ofthe Federal law and is therefore preempted. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226 </ITAG>Advertising, Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Credit, Federal ReserveSystem, Finance, Penalties, Truth in lending.
