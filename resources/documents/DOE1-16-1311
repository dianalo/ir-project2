The excitation of theactive medium in these lasers is done using CO{sub 2} laser radiation(optical coherent pumping). The problems in improving these laser's energyefficiency, directivity pattern, and radiative field distribution, aresolved for the first time by selecting an optical arrangement which usesan active medium pumping scheme and the resonator system of an intrinsicallyFIR laser. The characteristics of the necessary phase inhomogeneitiesin the FIR laser medium, inserted by the coherent pumping field, canbe determined only by mathematically modeling such a problem on a computer.The algorithm for this problem, according to Helmholtz's reciprocitytheorem, for obtaining a uniform plane field distribution of the FIRlaser radiation in the far field for the axially symmetric problem isgiven.</TEXT></DOC>
