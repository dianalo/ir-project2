Allen's article on Operation Rescue (&quot;Police Brutality -- but No Outrage, editorial page, Aug. 18) overlooked some facts: Those people were arrested for violently attacking women seeking access to health care; for violently attacking the property and staff of legal, state-licensed health care facilities.    They were prepared in advance to violate the law in order to provoke arrest. They were trained to resist arrest, forcing police to employ accepted, legal tactics for subduing resisters. They were trained to exploit these police tactics by contorting their own bodies, causing their own physical discomfort. They were trained as to the precise moment to shout, &quot;Video, video]&quot; so their cameraman could film closeups of their contorted bodies and faces.    These isolated film clips do not tell the story of police brutality and unnecessary arrests. This is the story of a group deliberately violating the civil rights of innocent citizens who will not conform to their religious philosophy on abortion.    It is frightening that Mr. Allen, as chairman of our Civil Rights Commission, cannot see that this group's activities and goals parallel the McCarthy era, not the civil-rights movement.    Catherine H. Bruno    Silverthorne, Colo.    ---   This is exactly what Operation Rescue wants. The attention, but also the arrests. Their logic is: Get arrested, make the city lose money on police overtime, clog the courts with trespassing offenders and force the city to press for the closing of abortion clinics.    Last year, Rex Moses, director of Operation Rescue in Austin, spoke before a meeting of the Young Conservatives of Texas. I was at that meeting and became so enraged at Mr. Moses's sweeping propaganda that I withdrew my membership rather than take part in an organization that condoned such behavior.    Jessica D. Vincent    Austin, Texas    ---   After reading Mr. Allen's article it is obvious that the incredible controversy created by the abortion issue is too much for even our Civil Rights Commission and elected officials to handle. It is a sad commentary on our supposedly advanced system of justice that despite numerous documented instances of police brutality toward Operation Rescue protesters no committee in Congress is willing to even investigate the serious civil-rights violations that have taken place. Until our representatives find the courage to confront the abortion issue head-on, protests will continue, police will be brutal, people will suffer, innocent lives will be lost and civil rights will be ignored.    Edward F. Veres    Audubon, N.J.    ---   It's disgusting to see Mr. Allen attempt to liken the Operation Rescue demonstrations with the 1965 attempts by blacks to register to vote. The blacks of Selma, Ala., were trying to exercise their constitutional rights; the Rescue people are trying to deprive others of theirs. Mr. Allen characterizes the &quot;rescues&quot; as peaceful and nonviolent. Is a mob of screaming people running through a clinic and smashing equipment his idea of nonviolent? When a seven-months pregnant woman has to climb a ladder to her doctor's second-story office because 150 shouting people have surrounded the doors, should she smile and say that their right to protest abortion &quot;peacefully&quot; is more important than her right to medical care?    Laura S. Billington    Maple Valley, Wash.    ---   Perhaps there is less sympathy for participants in Operation Rescue because they are not peacefully demonstrating to obtain their rights, but are illegally and immorally attempting to harass, beleaguer and torment women who wish to enter the clinics to obtain needed abortions. They are attempting to impose their beliefs on others and to interfere with others' exercise of fundamental rights. Occasional police overreaction in the removal of such outlaws is regrettable, but probably unavoidable. My sympathy goes to the people being harassed, not the harassers.    Marc Richman    Washington    ---   I was at an early Los Angeles confrontation, and saw the &quot;passive resistance&quot; techniques used by the protesters.    This was the sequence: Both Operation Rescue people and pro-choice people were told to clear the area around the women's clinic, on penalty of arrest if they did not. Pro-choice people left the area encircled by police. Operation Rescue did not. Police tried vainly to get the latter to walk to police vans. When they would not, the police were forced to drag or carry them, almost certainly sustaining back or internal injuries in some cases when protesters lay limp or dragged their heels.    Barbara E. Bernstein    Los Angeles    ---   It is a profanity to equate Operation Rescue with actions of Martin Luther King Jr. When Operation Rescue protesters block a clinic entrance, that is illegal, but nonviolent. But when they deliberately and maliciously crowd, shout at, coerce, intimidate and place vulnerable women seeking help in fear of immediate injury, an assault has been perpetrated. A battery need not be committed; it is still an assault. An assault is violence.    Operation Rescue has committed a great many of these assaults with relative impunity. They do not deserve the mantle of nonviolent action.    Albert J. Forman    Concord, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
