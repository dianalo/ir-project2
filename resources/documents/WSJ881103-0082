People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors are close to obtaining an agreement under which the Marine Corps official, Jack Sherman, would plead guilty to accepting bribes in the cash-for-information scandal. According to two people close to the investigation, the government has evidence that Mr. Sherman accepted more than $40,000 cash from defense industry consultants and their associates in a one-year period.    In a separate aspect of the case, prosecutors have notified lawyers for two key defense consultants -- William Parkin and Fred Lackner -- that indictments would be sought against their clients unless they agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the continuing inquiry.    All told, law-enforcement officials said, prosecutors are considering seeking criminal charges later this month against at least six people and two defense-contracting companies. But this initial round of charges isn't expected to include the two central figures in the case -- Melvyn Paisley, a former assistant Navy secretary, and William Galvin, a well-connected Washington consultant and former business associate of Mr. Paisley.    U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, who is directing the federal grand jury probe in Alexandria, Va., has said that he expected to obtain indictments by mid-November.    The legal actions are certain to shed more light on the activities of some defense consultants and procurement officials who have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Naval Investigative Service for more than two years.    The government's inquiry, known as Operation Ill Wind, has focused on whether consultants paid Defense Department employees for confidential information about pending defense contracts. Investigators and the grand jury have combed through hundreds of thousands of documents, including many wiretapped conversations, and interviewed dozens of witnesses in recent months.    Mr. Sherman's attorney, Louis Koutoulakos, wouldn't comment when asked about negotiations that have been under way with prosecutors.    In a telephone interview, Mr. Parkin said: &quot;Sooner or later, I figure the ax is going to drop. All the time they spent with my phone being tapped . . . they have got to try and do something to me.&quot; As he had in interviews with The Wall Street Journal last summer, Mr. Parkin maintained that he didn't do anything illegal and said, &quot;I'm not guilty of any bribery.&quot; His attorney, Gerard Treanor, declined to comment.    Mr. Lackner and his attorney, William Dougherty, couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Parkin, who ran a prosperous consulting business in a Virginia suburb near here, has emerged as a central figure in the investigation. He said in interviews with this newspaper that he paid Mr. Lackner, a California consultant, more than $15,000 to obtain &quot;inside information&quot; on a Navy contract for anti-aircraft equipment. Mr. Parkin said he passed the information on to one of his clients, Hazeltine Corp., an Emerson Electric Co. unit.    Mr. Parkin said he concluded that Mr. Lackner obtained the information from a top Navy engineer, Stuart Berlin. In an August interview, Mr. Lackner acknowledged getting some information from Mr. Berlin but asserted it &quot;was public knowledge.&quot; Mr. Berlin, who also is under investigation, has repeatedly refused to comment.    According to Mr. Parkin, he and Mr. Lackner shared consulting fees from Teledyne Electronics, Newbury Park, Calif.    According to people familiar with the inquiry, prosecutors intend to file conspiracy and bribery charges against Messrs. Parkin and Lackner. Other charges under study include wire fraud, mail fraud and racketeering, according to these people.    In the case of Mr. Sherman, the Marine Corps official, two people familiar with the negotiations said that prosecutors and Mr. Sherman's lawyer were close to a plea agreement but that no papers had been signed. The matter is expected to be resolved this month.    According to one account, Mr. Sherman made &quot;damaging&quot; admissions to investigators when first confronted last summer. Mr. Sherman's dealings with a government informer, John Marlowe, a former Marine and defense consultant, have been a focus of the government's investigation.    Law-enforcement officials emphasize that charges will be brought against others implicated in the scandal, and that the investigation is expected to extend well into next year. </TEXT></DOC>
