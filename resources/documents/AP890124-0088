Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi told legislators that 93Zimbabweans were slain by Mozambican rebels in 420 border raids inthe last six months from July 13.   Right-wing Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas mounted sixattacks against troops inside Zimbabwe and were blamed for 32 armedrobberies and 139 abductions in the same period, Mahachi said.   He said the rebels ``continue to direct their attacks against theunarmed local population'' and burned and plundered stores, schools,clinics and commerical and farming centers.   Mahachi cited sabotage and infiltration by agents of the SouthAfrican government as a threat to national security.   South Africa has mounted several attacks on facilities inZimbabwe of the African National Congress, the main guerrillaorganization fighting the government in Pretoria.   Zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965, when itwas introduced by former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith'sgovernment to crack down on black nationalists. The emergency, whichhas been renewed by Parliament every six months since independencein 1980, allows for detention without trial.   The latest extension was endorsed by 62 legislators present inthe 100-seat House of Assembly in Harare.   Some legislators called on the government to urge Mozambicanauthorities to hold talks with guerrilla leaders aimed at ending the11-year conflict in Mozambique.</TEXT></DOC>
