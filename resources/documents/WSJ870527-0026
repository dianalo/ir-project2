Garcia</HL><DD> 05/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Investors returned from the long Memorial Day weekend in a bullish mood, driving up the prices of a broad array of stocks while bonds and the U.S. dollar also rallied.    The stock market surge began with the opening bell as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. Traders said the stage was set for a stock market gain as the dollar strengthened against major foreign currencies in Tokyo and European trading. Bond prices were sharply higher by the time trading got under way at the New York Stock Exchange.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average sprinted ahead 54.74 for the day to close at 2297.94, scoring the third-largest point gain in its history. In percentage terms, it was a 2.4% gain for the industrial average.    Stocks maintained most of their early gains through midafternoon. The rally picked up more steam in the final two hours of trading.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.95 to 289.11, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.67 to 162.72.    Gainers on the Big Board had nearly a 4-to-1 lead over losers. Philip Erlanger, a technical analyst with Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn., said it was &quot;refreshing&quot; to see such a broad number of stocks move up yesterday.    Despite the gain in stock prices, trading activity was moderate on the Big Board. Volume rose to 152.5 million shares from 135.8 million shares Friday.    &quot;It was a one-sided market today. We might have to discount it as an indicator of investor sentiment,&quot; said Kenneth Ducey, a senior vice president at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in New York. He and other traders noted that many large institutional investors weren't very active.    Larry Wachtel, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said investors are losing some of their recent concern about rapidly rising inflation and this contributed to yesterday's rally.    Mr. Wachtel cited several reasons for waning inflation fears: the rise in the dollar is alleviating concern over higher prices for imports, wages remain under control, it looks as if the rise in crude oil prices may have leveled off for now, and many commodity prices are falling.    With the fear of inflation abating, some investors are taking a look at the stocks of companies that do well in a disinflationary environment. Yesterday, issues sensitive to interest rates, such as banks, thrifts, and utilities, as well as food, beverage, restaurant, soap, retailing and drug stocks, were among the gainers.    Mr. Erlanger said the short interest data for April, released last week, indicated that a large number of investors had sold borrowed shares of utility stocks, hoping to buy them back at lower prices. At the same time, there was little short interest outstanding in precious metals and mining stocks.    &quot;If there are so many people at risk in the utility sector and it starts to improve,&quot; he said, investors &quot;are going to have an awfully strong incentive to cover their positions.&quot; Yesterday, the Dow Jones Utility Average rose 3.46 to 198.47, after gaining 1.32 Friday.    Auto stocks advanced along with the general market until midafternoon, when mid-May auto sales data were released. New-car sales dropped to a 6.6-million-unit annual rate in mid-May from a year-earlier rate of 8.4 million units. That's a 24.9% decline when adjusted for the nine selling-day period in mid-May, compared with an eight-day period a year ago.    Joseph Phillippi at E.F. Hutton lowered his recommendation on General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler from a buy to neutral short-term because of the disappointing sales numbers. &quot;Even with production schedule cutbacks, I assume we're going to have a heck of a yard sale&quot; as car dealers clear their lots for 1988 models.    The auto stocks retraced some of their gains after the sales news. Ford ended up 1 3/8 to 92 after trading as high as 94; GM rose 1/2 to 84 3/4 after trading as high as 85 1/2; and Chrysler edged up 3/8 to 36 1/8.    The stocks of Japanese companies that are heavily dependent on exports for their revenue surged in New York trading yesterday. The lower yen, relative to the dollar, should improve the sales prospects for these companies, traders here said.    Matsushita moved up 13 1/4 to 132, Kyocera rose 7 to 67 7/8, Hitachi advanced 3 1/4 to 69 1/2, Honda Motor gained 3 3/4 to 97 1/2, Toyota added 1 1/2 to 25 5/8 bid, and NEC Corp. rose 3 to 63 7/8.    Among the gainers in yesterday's market were computer, technology, semiconductor, paper, railroad, telephone and advertising stocks.    Gold, silver and diversified mining stocks continued their slide as precious metals prices fell in the futures markets. These were among the few losers in the market.    ASA Ltd. lost 3 to 55 1/8, Newmont Mining dropped 5 5/8 to 96 1/8, Callahan Mining declined 3 3/4 to 27 1/4, Hecla Mining dropped 1 to 18 1/8, Asarco fell 1 7/8 to 22 5/8, American Barrick slid 3 1/8 to 35 1/4, Phelps Dodge eased 7/8 to 30 5/8, and Giant Yellowknife fell 1 to 16 on the American Stock Exchange.    Allegis jumped 4 7/8 to 76 1/8 on more than 2.4 million shares, making it the most active Big Board stock. An investor group including Coniston Partners and LA International Ltd. said it has acquired a stake of more than 13% in Allegis and plans to seek control of the company's board.    Spectra-Physics jumped 8 7/8 to 32 1/2 on more than 1.2 million shares. Ciba-Geigy offered to acquire all of the common shares of the company that it doesn't already own for $32 apiece. Ciba-Geigy and its affiliates now own about 18.8% of the shares outstanding.    Spectradyne advanced 1 7/8 to 43 5/8 in the OTC market. A group including Hicks andamp; Haas, a Dallas-based investment firm, and Acadia Partners L.P. of Fort Worth, Texas, agreed to acquire Spectradyne for cash and securities totaling $46 a share.    Care Enterprises rose 5/8 to 3 1/2. Southmark Corp., whose shares were flat at 9 1/8, said it aims to acquire control of Care Enterprises.    Warner Communications rose 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 in active trading, after moving up 3/4 Friday. A story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said that no matter the outcome of Warner's battle with its largest shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries, analysts believe both companies will enjoy the spoils. Some Wall Street analysts are recommending both stocks. Chris-Craft rose 3/4 to 26 3/4 yesterday, after gaining a point Friday.    Lockheed rose 2 1/8 to 46. McDonnell Douglas chose a Lockheed division to make wing parts for the new U.S. Air Force C-17 transport. McDonnell Douglas gained 1 5/8 to 65 7/8.    Federal National Mortgage Association rose 1 7/8 to 39 1/8 in active trading. The stock was recommended by a Wall Street firm yesterday.    ---                BIGGEST ONE-DAY GAINS    Date                   Close         Gain    %Chg    April 3, 1987         2390.34       69.89    3.01    April 21, 1987        2337.07       66.47    2.93    May 26, 1987          2997.94       54.74    2.44    Feb. 17, 1987         2237.49       54.14    2.48    May 5, 1987           2338.07       51.85    2.27    Jan. 22, 1987         2145.67       51.60    2.46    Jan. 5, 1987          1971.32       44.01    2.28    Nov. 3, 1982          1065.49       43.41    4.25    Jan. 27, 1987         2150.45       43.17    2.05    March 11, 1986        1746.05       43.10    2.53</TEXT></DOC>
