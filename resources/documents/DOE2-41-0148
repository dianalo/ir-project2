Progress observationsdocument the favourable effect of interstitial isotope therapy in deliminatedlow-grade gliomas and recurrences of extracerebral tumours, as well asthe effect of external irradiation of the neuroaxis in dysontogenetictumours. Histological diagnosis, however, is the prerequisite for therapydecision-taking, which can be obtained at low risk using the CT-(MRI-)stereotactictechnique.</TEXT></DOC>
