Holly, N.J., said it filed a lawsuit against Smith Corona Corp. and one of its distributors for patent and copyright infringement on an electronic spelling machine.    In a lawsuit filed Sept. 8 in a Camden, N.J., U.S. District Court, Franklin alleges that two models of Smith Corona's SpellRight machine violate Franklin's patent on an electronic spelling machine and copyrights on affiliated software.    Franklin also claims its New Canaan, Conn.-based rival is falsely advertising its spelling aids as &quot;dictionaries&quot; when no definitions are provided by the machines.    A spokesman for Smith Corona said the company hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment on it.    The suit seeks damages estimated at more that $1 million, and an injunction against further infringement.    Franklin's machine, Spelling Ace, is the company's core product. </TEXT></DOC>
