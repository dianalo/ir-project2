They aretrained to shoot to kill,'' Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci toldCongress last week.   Sen. Ted Steven, R-Alaska, said, ``The military is uncomfortablewith this, that's true, and I think there are very tricky questionshere, but they have to realize that the American public wants themto help.''   ``There's a war going on against our people, a war of drugs, andwe need the military's help in fighting that war,'' said Stevens.   Two weeks ago, the House voted 385-23 to order President Reaganto have the military seal off U.S. borders against drug trafficking.   Last Friday, the Senate voted 83-6 to order an expanded militaryrole, including arrest powers for Navy officers aboard warshipsthat stop drug boats in international waters.   Both votes approved amendments to the separate Pentagon budgetbills passed by each chamber. The bills now go to a House-Senateconference to reconcile differences, including the military-drugprovisions.   Carlucci and other Pentagon officials have outlined two majorfears about expanding the military's role in the drug fight. One ispractical and the other legal.   The practical objection is that having the military fight drugstakes away from the Pentagon's main task of defending the UnitedStates against military threats.   The legal objection arises from the nation's traditionalseparation between military and civilian authority. That separationis most clearly spelled out by the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 lawwhich bans the military from enforcing civilian laws.   ``The military are not trained for the law enforcementmission,'' Carlucci said last week. ``To suddenly tell them you'rein law enforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, thetraining... There's a major difference between military and policework.''   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard noted that devoting militaryresources to drug enforcement means those resources will have to betaken from somewhere else and ``that can affect the readiness ofthis country to defend itself.''   The two fears are legitimate, noted Stevens and other supportersof an expanded military role.   ``I don't think we're really blurring the line too much,'' hesaid. ``Any arrests the military would make would be on the highseas, in international waters, where a member of the military hasthe same arrest power that any citizen does.''   As for the effect on the military's readiness to fight, Stevensnoted, ``I believe that's something that we're going to have toclosely watch, and if there is an effect on readiness, then we'llhave to deal with that. But they have to be ready to help thiscountry fight a war that's already going on, a war against drugs.''   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said, ``I think it's very troubling to be using themilitary this way, and one must be very careful because you runinto all sorts of potential legal problems about the separation ofthe civilian and the military.''   ``There are also potential problems with readiness,'' saidAspin. ``The military is trained for specific roles and missionsand to the extent you take them from those missions, you detractfrom readiness.''   But ``there is tremendous pressure to act,'' Aspin noted.``People want something done and the pressure is growing.''   Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said theyunderstood the military's objections, particularly on legal issues.But both are from states with long international borders and severetrafficking problems, and they said those facts override the fears.   ``We have to stop the drugs before they get into the country,''said Wilson. ``We need to stop them on the seas or in the air.Local law enforcement is being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs.Once it gets into the United States, it is immeasurably moredifficult to control.''   Graham said, ``this nation faces a terribly, terribly seriousdrug problem. I think that there is a narrow, specific role forarrests by the military in international waters. They have theresources to do this.''   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``We spend hundreds ofbillions of dollars a year on the military so we can be safe. Butthis nation is already at war, a war we're losing. And we need ourbest troops in that war.''   D'Amato, speaking of Pentagon complaints that drug fighting willhurt military readiness, said, ``This is a national security issue.Our military is supposed to help protect our national security.Drugs as bad an enemy as any other enemy we would face.''   The loudest critic was Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a retired Marinepilot, who chastised his colleagues Friday for speaking ``rhetoricfor press release purposes.''   ``We all get up, posture, make our little statements, and itisn't going to make any difference'' said Glenn. He said the nationlacks an effective, coordinated anti-drug plan.   ``This is not the mission for the military,'' Glenn said.</TEXT></DOC>
