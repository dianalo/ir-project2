It was the first formal response from local Palestiniansto the peace proposal Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir outlined inWashington earlier this month.   Shamir proposed elections be held in the occupied West Bank andoccupied Gaza Strip to select Palestinians who would hold talkswith Israel on an interim solution for the troubled region. Aftertwo years, discussions would begin toward a permanent solution.   The plan, as outlined by the Shamir government, rules out anyparticipation by the PLO, which Israel considers a terroristorganization.   In their statement, the Palestinian leaders called on Israel to``recognize the necessity of negotiations with the PLO within theframework of an international conference.'' It called the PalestineLiberation Organization ``the sole legitimate representative of thePalestinian people.''   The statement said Shamir's election plan was ``an attempt todivide our people into `inside' and `outside' Palestinians.''   It said the signers' ``rejection of the election proposal doesnot indicate a rejection of elections as a democratic process butis the rejection of a project which ignores the essense of theconflict.   ``This isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate howit will lead to the end of the occupation and to Palestiniannational independence.''   It urged that the United Nations be given authority toadminister the occupied territories during a transitional period toPalestinian statehood.   The statement, distributed in Arabic and English, was signed by83 prominent Palestinians, many known to favor the PLO.   Shamir's top spokesmen could not be reached for comment becauseof the Passover holiday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel saidhe realizes the Palestinians want a final solution, not an interimone, but that ``the Israeli thinking is if we start from the end,we won't have a beginning. This is the idea behind the step-by-stepapproach.''   Chief among them was Faisal Husseini of Arab east Jerusalem, whorecently returned from meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo onthe Shamir plan.   Husseini is considered the chief spokesman for the PLO in theoccupied lands. He has been held in jail without being charged formost of the 16-month Palestinian uprising, and also has met withIsraeli officials on their peace plans for the territories.   During the uprising against Israeli occupation of theterritories, 450 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed.   Others who signed the document included university professorSari Nusseibeh of Jerusalem; Haidar Abd al-Shafi, head of the RedCrescent Society in Gaza; Gabi Baramki, head of Beir ZeitUniversity; Mayor Hilme Hanoun of Tulkarem; and Audeh al-Ranteesi,an Anglican priest from Ramallah.   The United States has backed the idea of elections in theoccupied lands and has called on Israel and the Palestinians towork out a way to hold such balloting. President Bush said afterShamir presented his plan that he believes Israel must end itsoccupation of the territories but that he does not favor thecreation of a Palestinian state. Late last year, the United Statesreversed a longstanding policy and opened talks with the PLO.   The Soviet Union has been a major proponent of an internationalconference, which also has the backing of major Arab states,including Egypt and Jordan.   Today's statement said Israel ``finds itself moreinternationally isolated than ever before _ Israel has beenstripped of its main support and has been revealed as a terroriststate suppressing, with blood and force, a civilian populationstruggling with legitimate means for national independence.''   The Palestinian leaders put forward a four-point plan calling onIsrael to:   _Recognize the Palestinians as a people with a right to a securelife and an independent state.   _Recognize the necessity of negotiations with the PLO within theframework of an international conference.   _Allow the United Nations to administer the territories in theinterim.   _Allow the international conference to ``give suitableguarantees of security for all states in the region according todefinite principles agreed upon by all the parties.''</TEXT></DOC>
