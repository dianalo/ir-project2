But it retreated as trading ended before the talks yielded any news of accords between the U.S. and its leading economic partners.    After the close of trading, the group reaffirmed a February accord on stabilizing currency rates. But the dollar, which stood at 146.05 yen in late New York trading yesterday, fell below 145 yen in early Tokyo trading Thursday. Intervention by the Bank of Japan, which has become a daily routine, pushed the dollar back above the 145 yen level early Thursday in Tokyo.    One trader in Tokyo said there was disappointment over the outcome of the finance officials' meeting. Dealers described the Japanese central bank intervention as sizable, but couldn't estimate its amount.    Yesterday, despite the strong start, the U.S. currency closed only slightly above the previous day's levels in late New York transactions.    There were unconfirmed reports that several European central banks intervened in support of the dollar yesterday, but the reported activity was modest in scope and appeared uncoordinated.    Foreign-exchange traders primarily concentrated on yesterday's meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. The officials were in Washington for the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.    In Paris in February, industrial nations agreed to enforce stability in currency exchange rates. The disclosure of the agreement initially appeared to stabilize the foreign-exchange market. But in late March, the dollar began falling sharply, particularly against the yen, despite large-scale intervention by central banks.    Traders said much of yesterday's dollar-buying came from speculators seeking insurance against a possible strengthened accord to bolster the U.S. currency. In the absence of any early news from the meetings, many of the dollars bought were sold later in the day.    &quot;Anticipation led to some panic buying of dollars. When no tangible results were issued, we saw the dollar sold off,&quot; Audrey A. McNiff, a trader at Irving Trust Co., New York, said.    Much of the dollar's early gains were registered in Asian and European trading. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 1.8300 West German marks, ahead of its level of 1.8275 late Tuesday but off from its intraday high of 1.8415.    Despite the dollar's gains yesterday, skepticism ran high about the possibility that an international agreement would be able to tame an overwhelmingly bearish market.    &quot;I don't look at the firmer dollar as indicating confidence in what these guys (the finance officials) are going to do,&quot; Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York, said.    William G. Orsini, senior corporate trader at Bank of Montreal in New York, said, &quot;The market is still bearish on the dollar.&quot;    In European trading, the Bank of England was reported to have sold British pounds to buy dollars and West German marks, apparently trying to keep the pound below $1.62 and below 2.96 marks. The Bank of France, meanwhile, bought dollars and sold marks and French francs, traders said.    The Dutch central bank was also believed to have bought small amounts of dollars and marks and sold Dutch guilders.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $2 an ounce to $420.20 in moderate trading estimated at 3.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $421.50 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Wednesday, April 8, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
