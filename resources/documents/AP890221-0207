Official sources interviewed by telephone in the regional capitalof Pristina told The Associated Press that the southern province is``on the verge of a general strike.''   Also Tuesday, the official Tanjug news agency reported a policeofficial beat up a journalist who wrote about alleged corruption,one of a string of recent attacks on Yugoslav reporters.   The protest in Kosovo was triggered by a hunger strike of morethan 1,000 ethnic Albanian miners who refused to leave their pits atthe Trepca lead and zinc mine. The miners allege discrimination bycommunist authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic, Serbia, ofwhich Kosovo is an adminstrative part.   Thousands of other ethnic Albanians in the economically depressedprovince walked off their jobs in other Kosovo towns Tuesday insupport of the miners' demands that the Communist Party chiefs ofYugoslavia and Serbia, Stipe Suvar and Slobodan Milosevic, come totalk with them, media reports said.   The Trepca miners near Titova Mitrovica, 125 miles south ofBelgrade, protested the official Serbian policy that labeled them``demonstrators, nationalist and separatists'' when they took to thestreets last November, the state Tanjug news agency said.   Medical teams were sent to the Trepca mines where some of theprotesters have refused to take water and food for the past 24hours. The provincial communist leadership has opened an emergencysession to discuss the labor unrest, Tanjug said.   ``Although ventilation in the shafts is being maintained, thepotential danger of an accident in the mine is very real,'' AgimBajrami, a Trepca employee, told the AP, adding that the miners hadsealed off all the pit entrances not allowing anybody in.   The ambitious Serbian party leader, Milosevic, has been seekingto curtail the autonomy of Kosovo, which won broad independence fromSerbia by the current Yugoslav constitution adopted in 1974.   Serbian leaders want more control in Kosovo to protect the Slavpopulation allegedly persecuted by the ethnic Albanians, who make up85 percent of the province's population.   In November, the Trepca miners marched to Pristina to protest thedismissal of some top provincial officials as demanded by Serbia'sleaders and were joined by up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians.   In the southern republic of Montenegro, reporter Milovan Brkicwas assaulted Monday in the police headquarters in the capitalTitograd by Ratko Micunovic, a department head of the state securitypolice, Tanjug said.   Brkic, who had published a story claiming Micunovic and otherstate security officials were corrupt, lodged a formal complaint andwas assaulted again by a group of unindentified thugs waitingoutside, Tanjug said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment ofsevere head and other injuries.   Police said Micunovic was suspended from duty pending aninvestigation, Tanjug reported.   Last week, a woman television reporter was beaten up by anunindentified attacker who first vilified her for a recent programin which she presented the Albanian viewpoint in Kosovo.   Last month, a police cordon prevented several dozen rowdies frombreaking into the Belgrade offices of the Zagreb Vjesnik daily,angry about allegedly critical stories about Serbia's policies inKosovo.</TEXT></DOC>
