Skinner, whose intervention forced a change in the takeoverterms for Northwest Airlines, told House and Senate panels thatlaws governing leveraged buyouts in the airline industry couldcreate more opportunity for loopholes.   ``I agree that the industry, the investment community, theairlines all have the right to know what the department's policyis,'' Skinner said Wednesday.   ``But we've got to make sure in doing that that we don't createa policy that now the lawyers and investment bankers and everybodycan get around,'' said Skinner, a lawyer with buyout experience.   Under an agreement announced last week, KLM Royal Dutch Airlinessaid it would reduce its equity interest in the Northwest takeoverfrom 57 percent to 25 percent, limit the powers of the KLM memberon the Northwest board and drop plans for a three-member advisorycommittee the Dutch airline would have controlled.   The agreement also requires regular reports on Northwest'sfinances in light of the fourfold increase in debt _ to $3.1million _ that would be incurred in the takeover.   ``The pressure to pay down the principal and to meet interestpayments could threaten the carrier's ability to meet its otherobligations, including fleet replacement, aircraft repair andmaintenance, security, crew training and other safety relatedexpenses,'' Skinner said in testimony submitted to aviationsubcommittees of both chambers.   Skinner said KLM had too large a role even though only 5 percentof the stock would have been voting shares. The Federal AviationAct sets a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership, and says theairline must be controlled by U.S. citizens.   The takeover is being engineered by Wings Holdings Inc., led byCalifornia investor Alfred Checchi.   The $705 million leveraged buyout, announced in June, was thefirst of that magnitude in the airline industry, Skinner said.KLM's share was to have been $400 million.   Other buyout deals are pending, giving rise to congressionalconcern. Laws have been introduced to set financial requirementsfor airlines being bought out and to regulate foreign investment.   Skinner said he hadn't reviewed the proposed laws and couldn'tsay whether he supported or opposed them.   However, he made it clear that he supported deregulation, had nodisagreement with the use of foreign capital, which is cheaper, orwith ``recapitalizations'' that make sure shares reflect the truevalues of assets.   Skinner also was reluctant to involve the TransportationDepartment in the consequences of takeovers on employees, althoughhe has agreed to investigate the issue at the urging of airlineunions.</TEXT></DOC>
