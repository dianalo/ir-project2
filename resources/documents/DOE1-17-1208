<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1208 </DOCNO><TEXT>The principal program objective and principal part of the proposed actionis to improve the proliferation resistance of nuclear fuels used in researchand test reactors by providing the technical means (through technicaldevelopment, design, and testing) for reducing the uranium enrichmentrequirements of these fuels to substantially less than the 90 to 93%enrichment currently used. Operator acceptance of the reduced-enrichment-uranium(REU) fuel alternative will require minimizing of reactor performancereduction, fuel cycle cost increases, the number of new safety and licensingissues raised, and reactor and facility modifications. The other partof the proposed action is to assure the capability for commercial productionand supply of REU fuel for use both in the US and abroad. The RERTR Programscope is limited to generic design studies, technical support to reactoroperating organizations in preparing for conversions to REU fuels, fueldevelopment, fuel demonstrations, and technical support for commercializationof REU fuels. This environmental assessment addresses the environmentalconsequences of RERTR Program activities and of specific conversionsof typical reactors (the Ford Nuclear Reactor and one or two other to-be-designateddemonstrations) to REU-fuel cycles, including domestic and internationalshipments of enriched uranium pertinent to the conduct of RERTR Programactivities.</TEXT></DOC>
