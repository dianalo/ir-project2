Cornelius Sullivan, co-leader of a National Science Foundationpolar study expedition, said scientists studying the sea ice foundlarge and thriving populations of krill, a small shrimp-likeanimal, grazing on one-celled plants and animals that live in theice pores.   ``The sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energythe krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland,''said Sullivan, the director of marine biological research at theUniversity of Southern California in Los Angeles.   Existence of the vast population of plants and animals living inthe ice came as a surprise to researchers who spent 70 days duringthe heart of the Antarctic winter studying the polar ice.   During the winter, sea water freezes to a six-foot thickness andforms a pack extending 1,100 miles from the Antarctic mainland. Thetotal ice formed around the South Pole continent is roughly 11million square miles, three times the area of the United States.   Each spring, 80 percent of the ice melts, creating anutrient-rich layer of water that is filled with small plants andanimals, and with the birds and mammals that feed on them.   But the amount of life that existed within the ice during thewinter months was an unanticipated discovery, said Sullivan in atelephone interview.   He said the scientists found that the sea ice was not solid, butwas pocked with channels, ``rather like Swiss cheese.'' Thesechannels form as hairlike pores when the ice freezes and then areenlarged by wave action, said Sullivan.   Once the channels are in place, they form a home for one-celledplants called algae that live in the microscopic spaces between theice crystals.   Sullivan said the algae is ``remarkable'' because it is able toperform photosynthesis in temperatures at or below freezing.Sunlight strikes the ice five to six hours a day in the winter andenough of the light penetrates the ice to allow the algae to grow.   The ice algae, he said, has adapted to the frigid temperaturesand will ``fall apart'' if allowed to warm to typical roomtemperatures.   Once the algae has bloomed in the ice, Sullivan said, the poresin the ice surface becomes home to bacteria, protozoans andamoebas, many of which feed on the algae. The krill, free swimmingfrom the ocean, then make their way into the channels and feed onthe other small ice creatures.   Divers, exploring the ice from below, were able to probe the icechannels and bring out samples of the life there.   ``Almost all of the krill we found were in larval or juvenilestages, which gives us the idea that the krill are using the ice asa giant nursery for early development stages,'' said Sullivan.   Some studies indicate that the ice pack around Antarctica may beshrinking because the Earth is slowly warming. If this is true,said Sullivan, it could have an impact on krill, which is a keyanimal in the polar ecosystem.   Adult krill live in vast schools and are a favorite food ofwhale, penguin and seal.   ``Krill is a key species that others depend on,'' said Sullivan.A decline in the krill population could affect the populations ofother animals, he said, ``because they are obviously all linked.''</TEXT></DOC>
