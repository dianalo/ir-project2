Rarely has there been any mention of surgery or chemotherapy. And blatant references to death have been absolutely taboo.    But such soft selling hasn't drawn hordes of people into doctors' offices for checkups. So later this week, the cancer society will get deadly serious in a new television spot about colorectal cancer.    The ad will run in reverse sequence, with scenes of mourners at a cemetery, a hearse carrying a casket and a woman weeping by her husband's hospital bed. The flashback ends with the doomed spurning his wife's suggestion that they get a checkup for colon cancer.    &quot;It was risky for us to deal so honestly with death, but we believe scare tactics will jolt people more than an intellectual appeal,&quot; says Peter Hirsch, executive creative director of Calet, Hirsch andamp; Spector, the volunteer agency from the Advertising Council that created the cancer spot.    Other advertisers also face the prickly issue of depicting death in their commercials. The life insurance and funeral industries constantly wrestle with how best to market their death-related products. While they want to make a forceful sales pitch, they certainly don't want their ads to come across as macabre or distasteful.    Organizations trying to awaken people to the dangers of AIDS, drug abuse and drunk driving also debate how morbid their ads should be. A few years ago, a drunk-driving spot showed a car full of teen-age beer drinkers being transformed into gruesome skeletons. The ad agency that created the spot feared it was too grisly, but teen-agers in focus groups told the agency that they considered the ad tame compared with the special effects in slasher-type horror movies.    &quot;Some people deal quite well with their mortality, but most Americans are death avoiders,&quot; says David Willis, vice president of marketing at Service Corp. International, an operator of funeral homes and cemeteries. In a consumer study a few years ago, the company found that 35% of respondents said they become frightened when they contemplate their own deaths.    Service Corp., therefore, plays it low-key. A new commercial for its funeral preplanning service shows a family packing up dishes, books and memorabilia following the father's death. The mother informs her children that like her husband, she too has already made her funeral arrangements. &quot;We wanted the ad to ring true but be nonthreatening,&quot; says Murray Brauman, chief executive officer of Moss andamp; Co., the agency that produced the commercial. &quot;We don't want people visualizing themselves lying in a box.&quot;    According to Service Corp., only 21% of consumers say they're offended by funeral-home advertising. But some funeral-industry ads are so subtle, consumers might be hard-pressed to figure out what's being promoted. Consider, for instance, a funeral ad showing a little boy holding another child up to a drinking fountain. The message: &quot;Sometimes we all need a little help.&quot;    &quot;We would never show coffins in ads because that wouldn't be humane or dignified,&quot; says Glenn Gould, a marketing consultant for the funeral industry. &quot;But we also don't want to hem and haw with phrases like 'passed away' or 'no longer with us.' Our copy testing shows that consumers don't like those euphemisms.&quot;    Lately, the insurance industry has dealt much more frankly with the unpleasant reason that people buy life insurance. Allstate Insurance Co. bluntly uses the word &quot;dying&quot; in its ads and has created &quot;visual euphemisms&quot; for death. In some commercials, the insurer has superimposed a black box over the victim's face. In another ad, a woman and her husband are admiring a new clock on the mantel until -- poof! -- she vanishes into thin air.    One of the most memorable life insurance campaigns was Prudential Insurance Co.'s takeoff on the movie &quot;Heaven Can Wait.&quot; In the commercials, angels in white three-piece suits fetch their victims at golf courses and bowling alleys and escort them up an escalator to heaven.    Prudential tested the angel spots carefully with consumers because it wasn't sure how they would react to a whimsical treatment of death. Only about 15% of the people disliked the approach. &quot;I was terrified when we first put the angel commercials on the air because we were breaking new ground,&quot; says Connie Sartain, a Prudential vice president. &quot;But most people felt it was a hard subject for us and thought we handled it with charm.&quot;    Still, after one focus group session, Prudential reluctantly scrapped one of the commercials. It showed a man escaping from the angels and the angels fretting about how they would explain it to their boss. &quot;Consumers in the focus group went nuts when they saw that storyboard,&quot; Ms. Sartain recalls. &quot;They said that when it's your time, it's your time and you can't avoid it. They had real sympathy for the angels who were just doing their job.&quot;    The Calet Hirsch ad agency didn't test its new colorectal cancer ad with consumers, but the agency's executives say they're confident that it won't make people squeamish. What helps keep the spot from being depressing is its lively music. The agency decided to use an early '60s rhythm-and-blues sound both to lighten up the spot and to appeal to the target audience of consumers over 40 years old.    The ad opens with a shot of mourners huddled around an open grave. Suddenly, a casket rises out of the ground and is deposited back in a hearse. As the flashback continues, doctors remove a white sheet from the dead man's face, and an oscilloscope monitoring his heartbeat changes from a flat line to a wave. The final scene shows him working at a personal computer in his den, while his wife reads an article saying that 90% of colon cancer cases are curable if detected early enough. &quot;Maybe we should get a checkup,&quot; she suggests. His reply: &quot;I have more important things to worry about right now.&quot;    &quot;The cancer society has reservations about a shock technique like this, but Americans simply aren't aware that colon cancer claims 60,000 lives a year,&quot; says Irving Rimer, vice president of public relations for the society. &quot;Our previous ads were too pedestrian and didn't have enough dramatic value.&quot;    One of the earlier commercials, for example, had a much warmer tone, showing a recovered colon cancer patient returning home to a cake and hugs from family and friends. Another featured a tightrope walker discussing the risks of cancer.    Despite the images of death, some marketing consultants question how much more effective the new cancer spot will be in motivating people to visit their physician. In fact, Carol Moog, a psychologist and advertising consultant, says the coffin rising out of the ground may be reassuring because it subconsciously reinforces religious beliefs about rising from the dead. &quot;I'm not sure people will be persuaded to go for a colorectal test,&quot; Ms. Moog says, &quot;because the ad turns back the clock in such a magical way and makes death seem unreal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
