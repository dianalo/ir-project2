Itis determined that the average fan angle sums are all close to 180 degeven with structures of different coordination number. Coordination saturationis thus proved to be space saturation in the uranyl equatorial plane.Fan angle parameters of ordinary ligands are derived in the treatment.For compound UO/sub 2/A/sub m/B/sub n/C/sub p/ the steric packing arounduranyl ion could be estimated by the equation: FAS = mFA/sub A/ + nFA/subB/ + pFA/sub C/. Various packing diagrams are suggested to estimate thecompound stabilities and to construct the synergistic extraction systems.</TEXT></DOC>
