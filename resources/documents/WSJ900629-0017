Gustav Niebuhr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/29/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7A</SO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)</IN><LP>   The top officers of Baptist Press, a prominent religiousnews service used by nearly 500 newspapers and magazinesnationwide, are being forced out of their jobs, apparently asa result of a bitter factional fight within the SouthernBaptist Convention, which owns the news service.   Al Shackleford, 58 years old, director of Baptist Press,based in Nashville, Tenn., said he and editor Dan Martin, 51,were told to resign by Sept. 30 or they would &quot;be dealt withharshly.&quot; Mr. Shackleford said the decision to force them outwas made by the denomination's executive committee, whichoffered no explanation.</LP><TEXT>   Neither Harold Bennett, the executive committee'spresident, nor Sam Pace, its chairman, could be reached forcomment.   Mr. Martin said he believed that fundamentalists, whodominate both the executive committee and the denomination,&quot;want their own minister of information&quot; in charge ofSouthern Baptist news. Fundamentalists believe the Bible isliterally correct in matters of religion, science andhistory.   Mr. Martin added that the executive committee frequentlycomplained about news stories but &quot;never offered us anydirection.&quot;   Mr. Shackleford and Mr. Martin said they were told that ifthey resigned quietly they could receive up to six months'severance pay -- but only if they told the editors of Baptistnewspapers across the country not to come to their defense.Mr. Shackleford said he has no plans to resign; Mr. Martinsaid he hasn't decided what to do.   Founded in 1947, Baptist Press provides about a dozenpages of news stories about the Southern Baptist Convention,the nation's largest Protestant denomination, to 480newspapers, magazines and other institutions on weekdays. Thenews service maintains bureaus in Washington, Atlanta,Dallas, Nashville and Richmond, Va. Its stories are reprintedin 39 state Baptist newspapers, whose combined circulation ismore than 1.6 million.   For much of the past decade, Baptist Press has been underincreasing pressure as a result of turmoil within theSouthern Baptist Convention. Fundamentalists, who recentlywrested control of the denomination from a more moderatefaction, have charged that the news service has aggravatedthe schism by frequently reporting on the split and thatBaptist Press stories have portrayed fundamentalists in anegative light.   In the mid-1980s, the Baptist Press Association askedthree journalism professors to examine the news service'sstandards. The trio issued a report clearing Baptist Press ofcharges of bias. One of the three, John Demott, a professorat Memphis State University, praised Baptist Press as &quot;amodel for denominational news services,&quot; but said that it nowrisks becoming a &quot;propaganda arm&quot; of the fundamentalistfaction.</TEXT></DOC>
