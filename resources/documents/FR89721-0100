Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments if received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemsIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, or the most significant aspectsof such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule ChangeOn March 31, 1988, the Commission filed an order granting accelerated approvalof SR-PHLX-88-10, a proposed rule change establihsing AUTOM on a pilotbasis for market orders \1\<NOTE/> of up to 5 contracts, all exercise prices in the near month,for 12 PHLX equity options until June 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A market order is an order to buy or sell a stated amountof a security at the most advantageous price obtainable after the orderis represented in the trading crowd.On June 30, 1988, the Commission approved SR-PHLX-88-22 and authorizedan expansion of AUTOM to 37 PHLX equity options and an extension of thepilot through December 31, 1988.On December 13, 1988, the Commission approved SR-PHLX-88-33 to make ordersin all exercise prices for all expiration months for the 37 options approvedfor the pilot eligible to be handled by AUTOM and to increase eligibleorder size for AUTOM to 10 contracts. At the same time, the Commissionapproved an extension of the pilot until June 30, 1989.On February 3, 1989, the Commission approved SR-PHLX-89-01 to extend theAUTOM pilot until December 31, 1989 and to expand the pilot to includean additional 25 equity options, increasing to 62 the number of equityoptions that would be permitted to be traded in the AUTOM pilot.<ITAG tagnum="84">Manual AUTOM Execution Procedures</ITAG>A member organization wishing to use the AUTOM system must designate anAUTOM floor representative on the options floor, which representative isresponsible for reviewing all AUTOM activity for accuracy and completeness.Currently, all eligible orders delivered electronically to the optionsfloor of the Exchange through AUTOM are executed manually. Every eligibleorder electronically delivered to the options floor through AUTOM is printedin hard copy form at the floor representative booth of the delivering memberorganization and show to the trading crowd on a display screen with buy/sellinformation omitted.\2\<NOTE/> Simultaneously, the order is printed in hard copy form atthe specialist post. The order is executed manually in accordance withthe rules of the Exchange, like any other order, with interaction betweenall interests, including the specialist, limit order book and the tradingcrowd. Upon execution of the order, the contra-side(s) prepares a ticketevidencing participation in the transaction. The hard copy of the AUTOMorder which is printed at the specialist post is matched with the contra-sidebuy/sell ticket(s) and essential trade information (<T3>i.e., </T3>number of contracts, symobl, price, buyer/seller) and clearinginformation is entered into the Exchange's CENTRAMART system \3\<NOTE/> for comparison and settlement purposes, which entry immediatelygenerates a hard copy floor confirmation to the floor represenatives forthe buyer and seller and also generates a report to the Options Price ReportingAuthority (``OPRA''). A report of such execution is electronically returnedto the delivering member organization. Finally, a report of the executionis immediately printed in hard copy form at the floor representative boothof delivering member organizations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For example, an order to buy 4 XYZ AA at the market isdisplayed as 4 XYZ AA MKT.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ CENTRAMART is the Exchange system used for quote dissemination,trade reporting and clearing information.The AUTOM floor representative, having received a copy of the incomingorder, a copy of the Exchange floor confirmation and a copy of the executionreport which was sent to the member organization which delivered the order,matches the informaiton for accuracy. If the information is incorrect ordeficient in any way, it is corrected.The contra-side of the transaction matches the information contained onthe contra-side ticket with the Exchange floor confirmation for accuracy.If the information is incorrect or deficient in any way, it is corrected.Shortly after the close of trading, every member which transacted businessin options during the course of the day receives a complete summary ofall transactions affected as well as a record of any changes made to suchinformation during the course of the day. All transactions are checkedfor accuracy by the AUTOM floor representative and contra-side againstthe terms of the order. If the information is incorrect or deficient inany way, it is corrected. When the check-out process has been completed,all transaction information is transmitted to the Options Clearning Corporation(``OCC'') for clearance and settlement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Automatic AUTOM Execution Procedures</ITAG>The Exchange now proposes to further enhance the AUTOM system by installingan automatic execution feature for certain eligible market and marketablelimit orders \4\<NOTE/> as well as making day limit orders \5\<NOTE/> eligible for delivery through the system. It is proposedthat such automatic execution feature operate on a pilot basis for 12 PHLXequity options until June 30, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A marketable limit order is an order to buy or sell astated amount of a security as a specified price, if obtainable, afterthe order is represented in the trading crowd, entered at a time when themarket is trading at or better than the specified price.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A day limit order is an order to buy or sell a statedamount of a security at a specified price. A day limit order expires atthe end of the day on which it is entered if it is not executed.Automatic execution will apply to market orders and marketable limit ordersof up to 10 contracts in at the money options, the next strike price higherand the next strike price lower (<T3>i.e., </T3>three strike prices, all expirations). All other eligiblemarket orders, marketable limit orders and day limit orders delivered tothe Exchange through the AUTOM system will be executed manually.Only single orders of up to 10 contracts will be eligible for deliveryand automatic execution through the AUTOM system. For example, a retailuser of the AUTOM system may not break up a 20 contract order into 2 ordersfor the purpose of attempting to make such order eligible for deliverythrough the system. Only customer (<T3>i.e.</T3>, agency) orders will be eligible for automatic execution.Orders identified as ``firm'' or ``market maker'' and those identifiedas required to yield priority, parity and precedence pursuant to SEC rulesare not eligible for automatic execution through the AUTOM system. Market orders received by the specialist through the AUTOM system before9:25 AM shall participate in the opening and shall be manually executedat the price of the opening sale. Market orders received by the specialistafter 9:25 AM and prior to the opening sale shall participate in the openingand shall be manually executed at the price of the opening sale, providedsuch opening sale shall take place at a time which would reasonably includesuch orders; otherwise they shall be executed upon completion of openingrotation.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A trading rotation is a procedure initiated by the Exchangein order to aid in producing a fair and orderly market in a particularoption. It generally consists of a series of brief time periods duringeach of which bids, offers and transactions may be made only with respectto a single, specified series of the option for which it was initiated.During a trading rotation (which typically takes several minutes to conduct,but may at times take a substantially longer period), customer orders alreadyon the trading floor may be executed, but it may be difficult or impossiblefor new customer orders to be executed or for pending customer orders tobe executed. Limit orders received by the specialist through the AUTOM system before9:25 AM shall participate in the opening and shall be manually executedat the price of the opening sale if they are so entitled based upon priceand the size of the bid which is accepted or size of the offer which istaken establishing the opening price. Limit orders received by the specialistafter 9:25 AM and prior to the opening sale shall participate in the openingand shall be manually executed at the price of the opening sale if theyare so entitled based upon price and the size of the bid which is acceptedor size of the offer which is taken establishing the opening price, providedsuch opening sale shall take place at a time which would reasonably includesuch orders; otherwise they shall be executed upon completion of openingrotation. All AUTOM orders received prior to the opening will be printed and displayedat floor locations as previously described. When manually executed duringrotation, such executions are printed, confirmed on the floor and reportedto OPRA as previously described. Orders eligible for automatic execution receive a guaranteed executionat the market quote. In the case of an automatic execution, the specialistis the contra-side of all trades although he must ensure participationof bids and offers on the limit book and in the trading crowd which areentitled to executions under the Exchange's rules of priority, parity andprecedence. Upon the completion of rotation, markets (<T3>i.e.</T3>, bids and offers) will be reviewed by the specialist andupdated as necessary after which the automatic execution feature of theAUTOM system will be engaged. Thereafter, market orders and marketablelimit orders which were delivered through the AUTOM system during the rotationprocess but were not entitled to be executed at the opening will be executedautomatically, if entitled, based upon the displayed bid and offer. Similarly,orders subsequently received which are eligible for automatic executionwill be executed based upon the displayed bid and offer. Away from themarket day limit orders subsequently received will be entrusted to thespecialist for execution on a manual basis. When the automatic execution feature is engaged, an imcoming eligible marketorder will: be printed in hard copy form at the floor representative boothof the delivering member organization; be shown on the trading crowd displayscreen with buy/sell information omitted; be printed in hard copy format the specialist post; automatically be priced at the displayed bid oroffer, as appropriate; automatically be executed at the assigned pricewith the specialist being contra-side; automatically be reported to OPRA;immediately generate a hard copy floor confirmation to the floor representativeof the delivering firm; and, automatically be reported back to the deliveringmember organization. An incoming eligible marketable limit order pricedat the offer, if an order to buy, or priced at the bid, if an order tosell, will be handled in the same fashion. Upon execution of the order, the contra-side prepares a ticket evidencingparticipating in the transaction. The hard copy of the AUTOM order whichis printed at the specialist post is matched with the contra-side buy/sellticket(s) and essential trade information is entered into the Exchange'sCENTRAMART system for comparision and settlement purposes, which entryimmediately generates a hard copy floor confirmation to the floor representativefor the buyer and seller and also generates a report to OPRA. A reportof such execution is electronically returned to the delivering member organization.Finally, a report of the execution is printed in hard copy form at theAUTOM floor representative's booth of the delivering member organization.The trade checking process for automatic executions is the same as thosepreviously described.The automatic execution feature of the AUTOM system will remain in continuousoperation during the trading day absent operational failure, trading halts,or trading suspensions in underlying securities, and would be disengagedonly in the interest of maintaining a fair and orderly market and investorprotection. If a situation arose that necessitated disengaging the automaticexecution feature in a specific options class, two floor officials wouldhave to concur. Before the automatic execution feature could be disengagedfloorwide during a trading day, the Exchange's Emergency Committee \7\<NOTE/> would have to determine that such action was necessary tomaintain fair and orderly markets or protect investors. Similarly, beforea decision could be made not to activate the automatic execution featurein a given options class two floor officials would have to concur thatsuch action was appropriate to ensure fair and orderly markets and investorprotection; before a decision could be made not to activate the automaticexecution feature floorwide, the Emergency Committee would have to concurthat such action was appropriate to ensure fair and orderly markets andinvestor protection.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Emergency Committee consists of the Exchange's Chairman,President, and Chairmen of the Floor Procedure, Options and Foreign CurrencyOptions Committees.The Exchange believes expansion of the AUTOM system to include certainlimit orders and an automatic execution feature will permit it to offera level of service prospective users will require, while remaining competitivewith other markets.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'')and American Stock Exchange (``AMEX'') have small order execution systemsfor options.The Exchange has received insignificant order flow through AUTOM and itdoes not foresee any significant taxing of the Exchange's computer systemsif the Commission approves the expansion of the pilot as proposed herein.Because the purpose of the development and implementation of AUTOM is toimprove the efficiency of execution of transactions in PHLX equity optionsthrough the use of new data processing and communications techniques, theproposed rule change is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). In addition, the proposalfosters ``fair competition * * * among exchange markets'' consistent withSection 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act in that other options exchanges currentlyhave in place Commission approved automatic execution features in theirsmall options order delivery systems. The proposal is also consistent withSection 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitableprinciples of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanismof a free and open market and a national market system.B.
