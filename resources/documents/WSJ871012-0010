DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   Thousands of investors nationwide have answered their phones lately to hear an unusual offer: gold at 45% below market price. But the gold won't be delivered until 15 months after the purchase -- and then from a mine that isn't yet operating.    Several questions have been raised about claims in the offer, and the delayed-delivery agreement has run afoul of some state laws on securities and commodities offerings. Moreover, based on the history of the site, there's some doubt about the seller's estimate of the amount of gold it can get from the mine.    In telephone calls and follow-up mailings, Wind River Mining Co. Project II is offering investors 20 ounces of gold for $250 an ounce, compared with a market price of about $460. The buyers pay immediately, but under the sales agreements they sign, the gold isn't to be delivered until 15 months later.    The man behind the offer is Theodore N. Youngquist, a veteran of various small mining ventures, mostly in California. Youngquist Mine Development andamp; Consultation Inc., Georgetown, Calif., issues the agreement and, doing business as Wind River Mining Co., plans to mine the gold buyers are to receive. The mine is in Skamania County, Wash., an hour's drive from Portland. (Wind River isn't connected with the Homestake Mining Co. unit of the same name based in Grants, N.M.)    Pre-selling gold at below market price to raise start-up capital isn't unknown in the mining industry. But it apparently hasn't been done before on such a broad scale as Wind River's phone solicitation.    The company, however, says it was unable to get more conventional financing. It says that once enough money is raised to start mining, additional gold will be sold at full price, without a time lag and through more traditional means than phone sales. Jack A. Whitley II, Wind River's attorney, says the telephone marketing already has brought in more than half of the $2.5 million it was intended to raise.    Still, some of these investors may not be fully aware of what they're getting into -- at least, if they are relying on the company's sales materials.    For example, Mr. Youngquist's resume, included in the sales packet, says he is &quot;fully qualified as (an) Engineer.&quot; But he never attended engineering school and isn't licensed as an engineer in either Washington state, where the mine is located, or California, where his companies are based. Mr. Whitley says that although Mr. Youngquist, a third-generation miner, doesn't have an engineering degree, &quot;he's just grown up in the mines.&quot; Mr. Youngquist declined to be interviewed, referring all questions to Mr. Whitley.    A brochure sent to potential buyers says, &quot;One reliable report estimates gold reserves in excess of two million troy ounces.&quot; But a geological report, also in the sales packet, cites &quot;probable&quot; reserves of 40,000 ounces. Asked about the brochure, Mr. Whitley said, &quot;Unfortunately, it is still in use&quot; but will be discontinued soon. He says the company stands by the 40,000-ounce figure, not the two million estimate, but adds that one geologist's report did support the higher figure.    A sales letter sent to some customers by Universal Marketing Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif., on behalf of Wind River says, &quot;Although any investment involves a degree of risk, such hazards have been minimized here because we are dealing with inventory from a proven producing mine (since 1957).&quot; But the mine isn't producing anything at the moment, and production at the site hasn't been successful in the past. Before Mr. Youngquist acquired leasing rights in 1983, a series of operators had failed to mine profitable volumes of gold-bearing ore there.    A report issued by the state of Washington in 1977 recounts a history of start-ups and close-downs at the site. It notes that around 1959, &quot;milling operations ceased because of poor recoveries,&quot; and in 1967 &quot;the low gold content of the ore forced mining operations to close.&quot; Wind River says that gold prices were much lower when the old mines flopped, and that it will use better technology than the previous miners did. The company says it will start production in November or December.    In addition, Mr. Whitley says an early backer in the project was Edward Mazur, a Los Angeles gold-coin dealer who in 1986 was charged in state court in Los Angeles with criminal fraud in connection with an unrelated national telephone solicitation to sell gold and silver coins. Mr. Mazur pleaded not guilty, and the case is scheduled to go to trial in December. Mr. Mazur couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Whitley says Mr. Mazur currently has no connection with Wind River.    Regulators in Washington state, North Dakota, Iowa and Montana have halted Wind River's solicitations on the ground that the company's sales pitch is an unregistered securities or commodities offering. In Oregon and Texas, the company has voluntarily stopped marketing, at the request of state securities officials. California and Michigan also are investigating whether the sales require registration as a securities offering.    The regulators say that since the company hasn't registered the offer, they aren't able to scrutinize whether the venture is feasible and adequately financed.    Mr. Whitley says the company doesn't consider the sales to be a securities offering because the investor simply buys gold, not an interest in the mine. But the company can't afford to challenge the cease-and-desist orders that states have issued to halt sales, the lawyer says.    &quot;Everybody here has their belt tightened,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody is driving old cars and lives in small houses. We all are trying to hold our expenses down so the money can go for the mine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
