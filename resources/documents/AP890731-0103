The caller, speaking in Lebanese Arabic and English, said thebody of Higgins was dumped behind St. Joseph hospital in westBeirut, that Syrians picked up Higgins' corpse at 4 p.m., ``and weare no longer responsible for the body.''   It could not be immediately verified if the caller was from theorganization, which had not made previous calls to the Cyprusoffice of The AP.   No body was found at the hospital and police said they could notconfirm the killing. The Syrian military command, whose troopspatrol Moslem areas of Lebanon, would not comment.   A police spokesman said: ``It seems highly unlikely that thecaptors were able to hang the man, take the film and distribute itinside an hour.''   In Israel, officials repeated their offer to trade all Shiitesthey hold from south Lebanon for three Israeli soldiers and theWestern hostages.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Perez de Cuellar's spokesman,Juan-Carlos Brandt, said if Higgins had been killed, ``thesecretary-general can only express his outrage and revulsion at thefact that an innocent man serving the United Nations in the causeof peace should be murdered in this fashion.''   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had said earlierthe threat to Higgins ``has nothing to do with us,'' but added thatIsrael should be pressed to release Obeid. ``We condemn any kind ofkidnapping or death threat,'' he said.   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attachedto the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he wasabducted near Tyre.   Previous statements from his captors claimed he used the U.N.post as a cover for spying on Moslem guerrillas.   In their last statement, on Dec. 12, 1988, they said Higgins hadbeen sentenced to death after making ``full confessions about hisespionage activities.''   Sources in the U.N. force have said they believe Higgins wasdead when that statement was issued. They said they had informationhe died of maltreatment after an attempt to escape.   Previous statements from the captors were accompanied byphotographs of the decorated Vietnam veteran or of his militaryidentification card.   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press the United Nationsgot unconfirmed reports that Higgins was killed after the USSVincennes, on duty in the Persian Gulf, shot down an Iranianjetliner on July 3, 1988.   The death of another hostage, 67-year-old journalist AlecCollett, was announced under similar circumstances in April 1986.Collett was kidnapped March 25, 1985, while on assignment inLebanon for a U.N. agency.   His captors said he was hanged in retaliation for The April 15,1986, U.S. air raids on Libya. A videotape of a body suspended froma gallows could not be verified and no body was found.   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the releaseof foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel tonegotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,though no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction ormade demands for his release.   Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the Western held longest in Lebanon. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
