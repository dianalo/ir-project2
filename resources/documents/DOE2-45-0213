<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0213 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes a method and a device for supplying fuel and airto an internal combustion engine, in the case of which fuel is suppliedto at least one injection valve and combustion air is supplied to atleast one intake pipe provided with a throttle. For the purpose of achievinga simple and reliable mode of operation and for the purpose of guaranteeinga reliable supply of fuel and air to the internal combustion engine underall operating conditions, the intake pipe has coercively supplied theretoa predetermined amount of air corresponding to the respective positionof the throttle. Simultaneoulsy, the injection valve has coercively suppliedthereto an amount of fuel in a fixed predetermined ratio to the amountof air. For carrying out this method, a pump device is used, which isprovided with two pump impellers which are arranged such that they arecoaxial and adapted to be rotated about an ideal axis of rotation andwhich are disposed in separate flow channels. Said pump impellers constitutecontra-rotating parts of a motor which does not have any output shaftand which is exclusively used for the purpose of driving said pump impellers.The first pump impeller is part of a fuel pump whos outlet is connectedto at least one injection nozzle. The second pump impeller is designedas an air compressor impeller arranged in the area of the intake pipe.</TEXT></DOC>
