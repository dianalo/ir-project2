RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to use aChicago drug prosecution to consider expanding police search powers.   The justices said they will hear arguments that police, actingwithout a warrant, should be allowed to use evidence seized afterthey were allowed into a man's apartment by his girlfriend.   The defendant, Edward Rodriguez, was arrested on July 26, 1985,on charges he possessed cocaine and marijuana with intent todistribute the drugs. Police said the drugs and drug paraphernaliawere in plain view at Rodriguez's apartment.   Gale Fisher, who lived with Rodriguez part-time, summoned policeto her mother's home on July 26. She told them Rodriguez had beatenher at the couple's apartment and she wanted to make a complaint.   The police then accompanied her to Rodriguez's apartment and sheopened the door with a key. She later testified that she took thekey from Rodriguez's dresser after the two argued earlier that day.   An Illinois appeals court said police violated the defendant'srights because Ms. Fisher lacked authority to let the police intothe apartment.   Police may not enter and search a home without a warrant ``ifthe party who consented to the entry had apparent authority to doso but lacked actual authority,'' the state appeals court said.   The appeals court noted that Ms. Fisher's name was not on theapartment lease and she did not help pay the rent. Also, the statecourt said, she was an infrequent visitor and did not have accessto the apartment when Rodriguez was not there. She also had movedher clothes and children to her mother's home, the state courtnoted.   ``All of these factors indicate that Fisher did not have thecommon authority over the defendant's apartment that was necessaryto make her consent to enter valid,'' the state court added.   The Illinois attorney general's office, in appealing to theSupreme Court, said police acted in good faith when they relied onMs. Fisher's ``apparent authority to permit entry into the home.''   The Supreme Court in 1974 ruled that when one occupant of a homeconsents to a search of the premises, evidence police find may beused against another occupant.   The case is Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 88-2018.</TEXT></DOC>
