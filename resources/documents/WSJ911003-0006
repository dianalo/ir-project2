A union spokesman said he expected the strikers to complywith the back-to-work order, which became law after beingpassed by the House of Commons and Senate.</LP><TEXT>   The bill was handled swiftly by the legislators because ofconcerns over the strike's impact on the Canadian economy,now in the early stages of recovery from a yearlongrecession.   The strike halted grain exports from West Coast ports andfrom the Lake Superior port of Thunder Bay, as stevedoresrefused to cross picket lines manned by government graininspectors.   At West Coast ports, 36 vessels were waiting yesterday toload grain, said the Canadian Wheat Board, a governmentagency. A further 10 grain ships were to arrive at West Coastports later this week. At Thunder Bay, seven grain ships wereidled, and another four were due in the port later this week.   A Vancouver Port spokeswoman said the British Columbiaport's two container terminals also were tied up by pickets.One container ship was at anchor, unable to enter its berth.Another was at its berth, unable to leave.   Elsewhere in the country, the strike caused mostly minordisruptions yesterday at air terminals, U.S.-Canada bordercrossings and various federal government offices. Manygovernment workers were prohibited from striking, becausetheir jobs were deemed to be essential.   The strike, in support of contract demands, resumed lastFriday after a renewed attempt to negotiate a settlementfailed last week. The government workers were on strike fromSept. 9 to Sept. 18.   The back-to-work legislation provides fines of as much as1,000 Canadian dollars (US$883.80) a day for workers who defythe order. Union representatives could be fined as much asC$50,000 a day and the union itself C$100,000 a day. Thestrikers' union is the Public Service Alliance.   The government, as part of its deficit-reduction program,has frozen wages of federal government workers this year andlimited their wage increases to 3% for each of the twofollowing years. It has refused union demands for greaterflexibility in its offer. &quot;To give in to the strikers'demands would mean we would have to raise taxes or increasethe deficit,&quot; said Harvie Andre, the government's leader inthe House of Commons.   The government claimed that its employees are much betterpaid and have much greater job security than most otherCanadians. Canada's unemployment rate is 10.6% of the workforce. Government workers represented by the Public ServiceAlliance have an average salary of C$33,500 a year and apension fully indexed to the cost of living, the governmentsaid.   Governments in nine of the 10 provinces have also eitherimposed freezes or curbs on government workers' wages thisyear. Only Prince Edward Island hasn't taken special measuresto restrain government sector wages.</TEXT></DOC>
