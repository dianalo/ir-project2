Cheney said at the end of a two-day meeting at the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization that no decision had been made to gobeyond the current bargaining in Vienna to reduce non-nuclearforces in Europe.   ``But,'' he said, ``I certainly would not rule out thepossibility'' that after an agreement was reached in Vienna, thealliance ``would then decide upon further steps to accelerate andexpand upon'' the pact.   He said he hoped that ``we will be able to persuade the Sovietsto ultimately withdraw all of their forces from Eastern Europe.''   The current bargaining between the 16 NATO nations and the sevenof the Warsaw Pact is designed to reduce the East's enormoussuperiority in tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers inEurope. Both sides would be brought down to equal levels underproposals on the table.   As part of those talks, President Bush has suggested the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union pare their forces in Europe to 275,000on each side. The plan would require the Soviets to pull out300,000 troops and the United States 30,000.   An agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe is expectedin the second half of next year.   During meetings with other defense ministers, Cheney sought todispel fears the United States would unilaterally pull its troopsout of Europe because of budget pressures and reduced East-Westtensions.   Reports of American plans to clip military spending in comingyears has prompted concern about the United States' ties to itsEuropean allies.   Cheney said that over time, the United States could possibly``contemplate ... additional reductions'' in deployments in Europe.   But, he said, such cuts would take place ``only in the contextof the alliance, only based upon consultation with our allies andonly based upon similar kinds of developments with respect to theEast.''   ``There has been no slackening in the U.S. commitment to NATO,''he insisted. ``There will be no slackening in the U.S. commitmentto NATO. There will be no unilateral reductions in U.S. deploymentswith respect to NATO.''   He said the United States' share of total defense spending byNATO nations amounted to 64 percent. ``I do not expect that tochange in significant ways,'' he said.   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said defense ministers atthe meeting found Cheney's remarks ``realistic and reassuring.''   He said said Cheney made clear that ``no significant changes''in U.S. forces in Europe were under consideration before an accordat Vienna.   Any major reductions beyond that, he said, would be done inconsultation with the allies.   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the UnitedStates sees future troop cuts to mean that Europeans ``must take onmore responsibility'' for the West's common defense.   In a final statement, the defense ministers welcomed the rapidpace of political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union andEastern Europe but urged caution.   ``A time of rapid political change presents the West with newopportunities, although the resulting uncertainty also carriespotential risks,'' the statement said.   ``Our defense requirements must continue to be assessed againstthe realities of Warsaw Pact military capabilities,'' it said.   They noted the Soviet Union had taken initial steps to fulfilllast year's promises of unilateral arms reductions, but said WarsawPact forces were still larger and better-equipped than in the West.   ``There has unquestionably been a change in the nature of thethreat which confronts us,'' said Woerner, ``but not yet asignificant change in the military capability of the Soviet Unionand the Warsaw Pact.''   The ministers said they would follow a step-by-step approach tochanges in the East and promised not to make any unilateral armscuts that could hurt chances for an accord on conventional forcesin Europe.   The leaders of the NATO nations will gather Monday in Brusselsto hear about Bush's weekend summit with President Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   The alliance's defense ministers meet twice year in their roleas the Defense Planning Committee. France, which is outside NATO'sjoint military structure, does not attend. Iceland, which has noarmed forces, has observer status.</TEXT></DOC>
