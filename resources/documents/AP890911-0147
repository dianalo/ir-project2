ABA President L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., in a letter to Bush,responded to statements made recently by drug policy directorWilliam Bennett that banning the manufacture of assault-styleweapons might be unconstitutional.   ``Over the years, the American Bar Association has carefullystudied similar legislative proposals (to restrict handguns orautomatic weapons, for example) and concluded that legislation toban or restrict a specific class of weapons _ rather than allweapons _ would not run afoul of the Second Amendment to the U.S.Constitution,'' Chauvin said.   ``The American Bar Association believes restrictions should beplaced on military assault weapons, whether made in the UnitedStates or elsewhere,'' Chauvin said.   Chauvin did not take a position on specific legislation pendingin Congress.   But he urged Bush to ban the export of assault-style weapons toColombia, where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipmentseized from drug lords in the last 18 months was found to have beenmade in the United States.   Chauvin urged Bush ``to respond swiftly and affirmatively to theurgent request of the Colombian government to end U.S. exportationof military assault weapons to the drug cartels in that country.''   ``Failing to take this step not only undermines the valiantefforts of the Colombian leadership to preserve democracy andjustice _ indeed, civilized society _ in that country butcontributes dramatically to the death and destruction beinginflicted on our own citizens by these drug cartels,'' Chauvin said.   Earlier this year, the Bush administration virtually banned theimportation of foreign-made assault-style weapons.   Despite Bennett's comments last week, Drug Enforcement Agencyadministrator John C. Lawn said Sunday that the administration isreconsidering a proposal to ban those assault-style weapons producedin this country.   ``The first step was the banning of the weapons from othercountries,'' Lawn said during an appearance on CBS's ``Face theNation.''   ``We must look now at our own procedures here in the UnitedStates,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
