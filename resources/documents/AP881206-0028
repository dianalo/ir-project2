If they don't have a place tolive, you find them a place to live.''   York has raised thousands of dollars and donated items to thehomeless and the hungry through his ``Acting for Life'' concern. Hehas headed the effort despite his fight against incurable emphysemaand a degenerative spinal disease that confines him to his home.   ``There's no sense grieving about it. The pain is there anyway,(but) I can't turn my back on other people. I've been there.   ``I saw the look on my mother's face when she had to give ussecond-hand Christmas presents,'' York said. ``That's how you learnto act. Because you don't want your parents to know you know.''</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.
