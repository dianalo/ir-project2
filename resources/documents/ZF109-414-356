 display companies filed ananti-dumping petition against Japanese flat-panel manufacturers.andP;  One U.S.andO;government trade expert said that it &quot;is a case of the Davids vs.andP;  Goliaths.andO;These are not the Motorolas and the Texas Instruments.&quot;andM;Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., is leading the charge.andP;  Othercompanies that signed the petition include Electroplasma, Magnascreen,Ovonics Imaging Systems Inc., Photonics Technology Inc., Cherry Hill DisplayProducts Corp. and Coloray Corp.andM;Administration protection steps criticizedandM;Another activity involving an Asian company that has sparked controversy wasthe recent bid by a small South Korean company to acquire Gigabit Logic Inc.,andO;a U.S.andP;  manufacturer of digital gallium arsenide integrated circuits.andO;Gigabit is a prime supplier of gallium arsenide devices to Cray ComputerCorp.andM;The buyout offer by the unknown Korean firm was submitted for review in Julyto the Treasury Dept.'s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States(CFIUS), sources said.andP;  CFIUS reviews foreign acquisitions of Americancompanies for national security concerns.andM;&quot;We're a private company and we don't comment on financing activities,&quot; saidSpencer Brown, president and chief executive officer of Gigabit.andP;  But Brownadded that his Newbury Park, Calif., company is &quot;looking for strategicinvestors from all over the world.&quot;andM;The CFIUS committee is not expected to block the sale.andP;  CFIUS has been thecenter of a government controversy this summer.andP;  When the committee declinedto stop the sale of Hercules Inc. subsidiary Semi-Gas Systems Inc. to NipponSanso several weeks ago, it created an uproar on Capitol Hill.andP;  Lawmakerswere upset with the Japanese acquisition of the semiconductor industrycompany, one of many in the last year.andM;The cry to reorganize and expand the focus of CFIUS became louder and moreurgent as a result.andP;  &quot;The [Bush] administration can't look at [Semi-Gas] as astrategic acquisition because it needs to be reviewed on a case-by-casebasis,&quot; said Deborah Wince-Smith, assistant secretary for technology policyat the Dept.andP;  of Commerce.andP;  Because of that case-by-case review,&quot; CFIUS isfundamentally flawed.&quot;andM;Wince-Smith said there have been about 30 foreign acquisitions of U.S.andO;semiconductor firms in the last few years, a phenomenon which threatens tokill an entire industrial sector if continued.andM;Each of the cases &quot;is looked at in isolation,&quot; she said.andP;  The U.S.andO;government is not studying the longterm ramification of entire industrialsector buyouts, but continues to review each proposed purchase individuallyto determine if it poses a threat to national security.andP;  CFIUS DirectorSteven Canner said CFIUS is not to blame for this situation because theorganization is simply following the letter of the law.andM;U.S., European leaders discuss cooperationandM;U.S.andP;  and European Communities officials met behind closed doors last monthhere and in Brussels to begin wrapping up four months of joint research talksto ensure competitiveness with Japan.andM;&quot;It's too early to say now what the conclusion of this activity will be,&quot;said Jan-Marie Cadiou, director of the E.C.andP;  information technologiesprogram, ESPRIT.andP;  Although no formal commitments have been made, &quot;there'sobviously good will on both sides.andP;  All the signs [are there] on both sidesof the Atlantic.&quot;andM;Cadiou declined to reveal programs under discussion.andP;  Areas of possiblecollaboration may include establishment of an electronic network in WesternEurope and high-definition technologies.andM;In an interview at the E.C.andP;  delegation here, Cadiou said he first noticedsigns of U.S.andP;  warming when he spoke to the National Academy of Sciences'Computer Science and Technology Board last January.andM;&quot;Immediately the topic of conversation came up,&quot; Cadiou said.andP;  &quot;I was notprepared for such a forthright expression of interest in cooperation with theEuropean Communities because previously my feeling was that Europe wasconsidered like a junior partner -- mildly immature and backward in hightechnology.andP;  All of a sudden it was clear to me that my counterparts wereconsidering Europe as an equal more than ever before.&quot;andM;As 1992 approaches, pendulum is swinging toward a more balanced relationshipbetween Western Europe and the United States.andP;  Japanese competition,escalating costs and declining profit margins are boosting the incentive forU.S.andP;  and E.C.andP;  collaboration.andM;The United States and the E.C.andP;  need to build on their common interests andheritage, White House Science Advisor D. Allan Bromley told Cadiou during hisvisit in late July.andP;  The senior governmental science officers met at an&quot;exploratory workshop&quot; for scientists from the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation and the EuropeanStrategic Program for Research and development in Information Technologies(ESPRIT).andM;&quot;If we are to realize the potential of the 1990s, it will only be throughgreatly enhanced international cooperation,&quot; Bromley said.andP;  &quot;History tells usthat all participants are going to be better off if we work together ratherthan striking off on our own.andP;  In many ways, Europe is setting the standardfor cooperation.&quot;andM;Investment tax credit for chip makersandM;In other areas of semiconductor technology, the National Advisory Committeeon Semiconductors last month issued its second report since it was mandatedby Congress in 1988.andP;  The first report was released last November amid strongBush administration criticism of several proposals to strengthen the U.S.andO;semiconductor industry.andM;The newer, toned-down version of the NACS report makes severalrecommendations, including establishment by government of a 50 percentinvestment tax credit on new semiconductor production equipment and arevision by Congress of anti-trust statutes to enable joint manufacturingconsortia.andM;Fields Joins MCC consortiumandM;Craig Fields, former director of DARPA, accepted a job with theMicroelectronics and Computer Technology Corp.andP;  Fields will be president,chief operating officer and chief technical officer of the Austin,Texas-based consortium.andM;Fields said he wants to forge closer relationships with MCC's membercompanies, as well as the University of Texas, the state government andtechnology companies located near Austin.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
