The weekend edition of Liberation reported that agents of theFrench counterespionage agency shot the footage in early 1989.   The story, which cited a ``very good source in Paris,'' said thefilm did not show the contents of the briefcase.   Bloch, 54, served at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to1987 and was the second-highest ranking diplomat there in his lastfour years.   He returned to Washington in 1987 and became director of theState Department's office of European regional political-economicaffairs. He is considered a specialist on the European Community.   Bloch was placed on administrative leave from the StateDepartment on June 22 while investigators looked into allegationsthat he spied for the Soviet Union.   The weekly Journal du Dimanche, citing no sources, reportedSunday that the man filmed with Bloch was a member of the Sovietdiplomatic mission to UNESCO, but also a spy for the new KGBservice known as Agency 4. The agency is charged with stealingsensitive techonology secrets, the newspaper said.   ``Several times, the American was in Brussels and Paris. Aneconomi expert, he prepared economic meetings of NATO, but alsothose of COCOM, the Paris-based organization responsible forauthorizing technology transfers to the East,'' the newspaper said.   ``From here, the question posed by Western counter-espionageservices: Was Felix Bloch part of a network destined to penetrateCOCOM?''   The 17-member Coordinating Committee on Multilateral ExportControls comprises Japan, Australia and all members of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization except Iceland. As East-West relationshave improved, the Soviet Union and some European countries,including West Germany, have pressed for the relaxation ofrestraints.   The sale of high technology to the East was among the topicsdiscussed during meetings in July between President FrancoisMitterrand and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   A five-week investigation into Bloch's activities by Austriansecurity authorities turned up no independent evidence that Blochengaged in espionage or met with suspected KGB contacts, accordingto Robert Danzinger, director general for Austrian public security.   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, arrivingin Paris for an international conference on Cambodia, said hiscountry and Bloch had ``no link that could raise the slightestsuspicion.''   According to the Journal du Dimanche and Liberation, Bloch'sposition at the embassy gave him access to sensitive informationincluding the identity of Central Intelligence Agency operatives inVienna and other Eastern European countries.   He also had access to secret codes used by various Americanembassies for internal communications and classified information ondisarmament negotiations taking place in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
