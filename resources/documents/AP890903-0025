In an extraordinary year, labor has suffered some major lossesyet won some impressive victories, although the spotlight on thenegatives has tended to obscure the bright spots.   A number of unions have proven that labor-management cooperationcan work but, as in the case of the United Auto Workers, learned aswell that too much of a ``good'' thing can prove troublesome.   Others have found hope in their solidarity _ particularly in theEastern and miners' strikes _ but will spend labor's traditionalholiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay fortheir pride and determination.   The movement has lost one nemesis, Ronald Reagan, but gainedanother, Frank Lorenzo.   Union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments inPoland _ their dues helped support the Solidarity trade union fromits underground days to its historic rise as leader of the firstnon-communist government in the East bloc. Through the AFL-CIO, U.S.unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment andother supplies to Solidarity while it was outlawed.   ``I think the role of the American trade union movement in thisshould not be overlooked,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland saidlast week.   Kirkland, head of the 14-million member AFL-CIO, the majorumbrella group for the nearly 18 million Americans who belong tounions, says those who are eulogizing the labor movement don'tunderstand it.   ``The key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought toexamine what we regard as the most important measure and that isinternal cohesiveness and solidarity,'' he said. ``And I think it'sfair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity andcohesion today than we've had in many, many years.''   A number of developments bolster Kirkland's point. Among them:   _The virtually unprecedented support of the pilots' union whenthe Machinists union struck Eastern on March 4.   _Joint negotiations between former enemies, the CommunicationsWorkers of America and the International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers, with ATandamp;T and the ``baby Bell'' regional telephonecompanies. That solidarity continued in a number of strikes againstthe regional companies.   _Nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1,700 miners who struckPittston Coal Group after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed tobring a settlement. Pittston is seeking to halt its contributions tounion pension funds, a move that likely would cause other companiesto follow suit.   Still, there have been setbacks for labor as well.   A trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steadyflow that has allowed Eastern _ and Lorenzo _ to move ahead withplans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller, non-union airline.Labor still hopes to use Congress and bankruptcy court to oustLorenzo but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches thesix-month mark on Labor Day.   The most highly publicized failure of ``Big Labor'' was the AutoWorkers' defeat in an election at a Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn.,its first attempt to organize a U.S. plant fully owned by theJapanese.   At Nissan, and at other industries that traditionally have beenthe backbone of trade unions, the labor movement is running into twomain obstacles: management programs to undermine union support bygiving workers more say and perks, and intricate anti-unioncampaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicantsto determine their attitudes toward unions.   At Smyrna, Nissan screened more than 100,000 workers for about3,000 jobs.   But Kirkland said the Japanese aren't to blame for doing that.   ``They are led into this course in some cases not by anythinginherent in their culture or their own countries, because in manyinstances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in theirown countries with good faith, but are following the advice ofhustlers, American hustlers, who have made a new profession out oftrying to guide employers for a fee,'' Kirkland said.   To counter such tactics, labor is changing the way it looks atorganizing and now accepts as ``associate members'' workers atplants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers lookingfor residency status in the United States.   By getting its foot in the door, and offering those workersbenefits such as cut-rate credit cards, insurance and legalservices, unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success inlater elections.   Such a concept, once reviled by traditionalists in the movement,has brought in 300,000 associate members in the past three yearsand, according to Kirkland and other federation officials, isbeginning to pick up steam.   The federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fightingamong unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance atnon-union companies targeted for organizing. And the affiliates aremaking fresh efforts at attracting women, minorities and workers inthe growing service sector.   The noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured someremarkable contract agreements.   The Steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workerswere forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry wasnearly crippled.   The CWA and IBEW came out of the ATandamp;T talks and the regionalnegotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovativepackages of parental leave, elder care and child care benefits.   And UAW workers at a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Illinoislast week agreed on a new contract believed to have the bestjob-protection provisions ever included in a major industrialcontract.   In the final months of 1989 the Eastern strike and legislativeinitiatives are likely to dominate labor's agenda.   Pending on Capitol Hill are efforts to raise the minimum wage anda number of other labor-backed measures, including expanded childcare benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers andacquisitions. Also pending, but unlikely to pass, is a measuredesigned to force President Bush to intervene in the Eastern strike.   Kirkland refers to Bush as ``Reagan Lite,'' sharing his formerboss' pro-management bent but not his virulent anti-union philosophy.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Sunday the Bushadministration was striving to maintain close contact with theorganized labor leadership.   ``We talk at least once a week with the AFL-CIO,'' she said.   Appearing on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday'' program, Mrs. Dole notedthat ``what I have been very pleased to see _ and we're urging acontinuation of this approach _ is cooperation between managementand labor.''   ``That trend has been occurring over the last 10 years. It's veryimportant that it continue, if we're going to become ever morecompetitive on a global basis _ that there not be so muchconfrontation and more cooperation between management and labor,''she said.   Even though Bush is regarded as no friend of the labor movement,he is not seen as its No. 1 enemy, as was Reagan.   That designation has been passed to Lorenzo, who was successfulin making Continental Airlines a non-union carrier and appears onthe verge of winning again at Eastern.   His recent talk of selling Continental has sparked hope in thelabor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory outof defeat.   Kirkland said there will be no winners even if the carrierreturns to the union fold. But his contempt for Lorenzo was clearlyevident as he added a caveat.   ``Scorched earth on both sides is not a victory,'' he said. ``Ofcourse it's better than scorched earth on just one side.''</TEXT></DOC>
