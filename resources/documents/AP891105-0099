With the Senate poised to send President Bush a bill forbiddingsmoking on virtually all domestic airline flights _ probably onTuesday _ cigarette opponents say they are ready to move on toother restrictions. Yet in the same breath, they warn that thewell-heeled tobacco lobby can't be counted out yet.   ``They've got lots of money and there are members from tobaccostates with important positions to keep legislation from reachingthe floor,'' says Rep. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, who has introducedlegislation to boost the federal levy on cigarettes.   Tobacco industry supporters insist that approval of the airlinesmoking ban does not translate into retreats on other issues, wherethey say they are stronger. But they caution that the other side ismotivated and gradually gaining steam.   ``The success of the ban was certainly a psychological blow butnot a significant economic blow, because there just aren't thatmany cigarettes smoked on airplanes,'' says Rep. H. MartinLancaster, D-N.C., whose district is one of the nation's leadingtobacco growers. ``But support here for the tobacco industry issteadily eroding. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figurethat out.''   The nation's $36-billion-a-year cigarette industry loses fewfights on Capitol Hill. Congress enacted a ban on smoking on shortairline flights in 1987, required a series of warning labels oncigarette packs in 1984, and in 1982 doubled the excise tax to itscurrent 16 cents per pack.   The question now becomes whether the industry _ whose lobby isone of the best-financed in the capital _ stands to lose morebattles.   The hoppers in the House and Senate are overflowing with billsaimed at smoking and the industry that profits from it.   Some would limit cigarette print advertising to words, with nomodels, scenery or color permitted. Radio and televisionadvertising is already banned. Others would boost the excise tax,in one case using some of the extra money for public serviceannouncements on the evils of tobacco.   Still other bills would limit the placement of cigarette vendingmachines, ban smoking by students in federally supported schools,halt government efforts to improve tobacco exports, and give theFood and Drug Administration authority to regulate the substance.   ``This is the only legal product in America that when usedaccording to the manufacturer's directions will kill you,'' Rep.Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the airline smoking ban bills,says to explain why tobacco products have become such a legislativetarget.   Durbin and his allies say their other measures are likely to geta boost from the success of the airline smoking legislation. Apublic that is gradually purchasing fewer cigarettes is also makingsuch efforts more acceptable in Congress.   ``There's a changing political atmosphere on the tobaccoissue,'' Andrews says.   The range of bills is wide, but few if any of them appear likelyto move out of congressional committees in the near future.   Tobacco state lawmakers _ including Chairman Ernest Hollings,D-S.C., of the Senate Commerce Committee and Chairman Charles Rose,D-N.C., of the House Agriculture tobacco subcommittee _ havestrategic positions that let them stifle anti-cigarette measures.   Congressional leaders are also loath to move too stronglyagainst tobacco interests, knowing they need the votes of lawmakersfrom those states on other issues. House Democratic Whip William H.Gray III, D-Pa., made a crucial speech when House-Senatenegotiators were working on the new airline smoking ban that helpedpreserve smoking on a handful of flights.   Another obstacle confronting cigarette foes is the broader rangeof enemies they face in their more ambitious efforts. On theairline smoking issue, ban supporters had just one opponent: thetobacco industry.   But any effort to raise excise taxes runs into opposition fromthe alcohol, fuel, telephone and other industries that face similarlevies. Advertising restrictions are opposed by publishers,advertisers and civil libertarians who say the move would violateconstitutional free speech protections.   ``I don't see anything coming at us with the speed or intensitythat airline issue represented,'' says spokesman Walker Merryman ofthe Tobacco Institute, the cigarette industry's trade group.   Yet neither does anyone expect the tobacco opponents to stoptrying.   ``You've got enough zealous people in the two houses of Congresswho see great political gain in this,'' says Sen. Terry Sanford,D-N.C. ``We have to continue to resist this, but there's noquestion they're motivated.''</TEXT></DOC>
