The fight, further complicated by the fact that the sperm donoris not the man seeking custody, centers on blond-haired, brown-eyedTessa, now 4 years old, biological daughter of Norma Lee Stotsky.   In January 1985, the day-old girl was given to Richard Reams andBeverly Seymour, a married couple who paid Mrs. Stotsky $10,000 andexpenses under a surrogate mother agreement.   The marriage broke up a year later, before the couple startedadoption proceedings.   The legal entanglements began a short while later in juvenilecourt in Columbus when Mrs. Stotsky, Reams and Ms. Seymourpetitioned for custody.   Subsequently, Reams filed an adoption petition with Mrs.Stotsky's consent, prompting Ms. Seymour to file one of her own.   Legal and personal complications have delayed a decision in thecase and put the child and her future at risk, according to Mrs.Stotsky's attorney, Patricia Grimm.   ``I honestly feel for all three of these people. They all loveher,'' she said. ``My client is pursuing this for the benefit ofTessa. She wants to make sure she gets a good home.''   Despite their clients' differences, Ms. Grimm; Tessa'scourt-appointed attorney, Charles Milless; and Reams' attorney, KimHalliburton, agree on one thing: Tessa is bound to get hurt.   ``It really is a legal ping-pong game,'' said Ms. Halliburton.``Unfortunately, Tessa is the ball.''   Milless said his goal is to protect Tessa from pain.   ``Any child involved in a custody battle is an unfortunate child.Overall, she's in pretty good shape. We have protected her, or triedto, from publicity,'' he said. ``I'm not so sure that sheunderstands all of this.''   A court-ordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor otherthan Reams was Tessa's biological father, despite what Ms. Grimmsaid was a ``gentleman's agreement'' among the three parties thatReams would be the father.   Although the donor, a former colleague of Mrs. Stotsky's, haswaived any claim to the child, both would-be adoptive parents andMrs. Stotsky have not.   All three filed custody petitions in juvenile court, but acomplicating factor is that Ohio has no law governing surrogacycontracts.   The custody requests were put on hold while the question ofpetitions for adoption, filed by Reams and Ms. Seymour, was debated.   Reams and Ms. Seymour temporarily lost their separate efforts toadopt Tessa last week when Probate Judge Richard Metcalf dismissedtheir adoption petitions primarily on the grounds that the two hadfailed to post required $3,000 bonds.   The order moves the case back to juvenile court, where custodyand financial support will be determined, Milless said.   Reams likely will appeal Metcalf's decision, Ms. Halliburton said.   ``If his rulings are not reversed, a choice will have to bemade,'' she said. ``This child, who loves both of her parents andwho truly believes that they are her parents, will be awarded to oneof them.''   Ms. Grimm said another married couple is interested in adoptingTessa, but has yet to formally enter the case.   All three attorneys indicated they would fight any attempt by anoutside party to adopt the girl.   Ms. Grimm said Mrs. Stotsky is undecided about whether tocontinue her pursuit of custody once the case goes back to juvenilecourt.   Ms. Seymour could not be reached for comment on the case becauseshe has an unlisted telephone number.   Tessa, now a ward of the juvenile court, splits her time eachweek between Reams and Ms. Seymour, who live in separate towns nearColumbus.   Although Tessa knows Mrs. Stotsky, she is unaware that she is herbiological mother, said Ms. Grimm.   Milless said he has no plans to appeal Metcalf's ruling becausehe believes adoption may not be right for Tessa.   ``I see no reason that one person should be allowed to adopt asopposed to the other. Adoption freezes the others out of the life ofthe child,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
