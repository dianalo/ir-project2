Cricis claim the suggestion by the Federation of EconomicOrganizations, known as Keidanren, is aimed at making the nation amilitary power.   In a report submitted to the Defense Agency, Keidanren said theshare of research and development expenditures in the defensebudget ``should be increased to more than 5 percent, the minimumshare allotted ... in major Western advanced countries.''   A Defense Agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Friday the federation's suggestion would be considered inpreparing the new defense plan. The current five-year plan totaling$76.5 billion ends in 1990.   In the defense budget for fiscal 1989, which began April 1, $595million was allotted for research and development. That is 2.1percent of the total defense budget, which is expected to beapproved later this month.   The United States earmarked 12.3 percent of its defense budgetto research and development in 1988. That would be about 104 timesthe amount spent by Japan.   Britain spent 11.7 percent of its defense budget on research andWest Germany 5.4 percent, according to Defense Agency figures.   Keidanren's suggestion was not made in connection with the jointU.S.-Japan project to co-produce Japan's next generation jetfighter known as the FSX, according to Masao Kanamori, who led thefederation's 80-member committee that compiled the report.   The FSX project was approved Tuesday after long debate by theU.S. Senate with an amendment insisting the United States be givenmore than 40 percent of the production work. Some congressmencriticized the project as a giveaway of U.S. technology.   The congressional debate led some Japanese to question Japan'sreliance on U.S. technology for its defense.   Japan originally wanted to produce the FSX on its own but agreedto joint production under U.S. pressure.   Most of Japan's defense-related hardware, including its F-15jets, is produced by Japanese manufacturers under license from theoriginal U.S. makers.   Keidanren officials want Japan to develop its own defensetechnology.   ``A one-sided flow of technology is not good,'' Kanamori toldreporters recently. He is the chairman of Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries Ltd., Japan's leading defense contractor.   In its report Keidanren called on the government to accelerateconstruction of large-scale facilities that ``exceed private-sectorcapabilities'' such as wind tunnels used in tests for aircraftengines and missile ranges.   There is no testing range for long-distance missiles in Japan,and Defense Agency personnel conduct missile training at a U.S.Army facility near El Paso, Texas.   ``Japan's commercial technology is outstanding and now they(Japanese businesses) are challenging military technology,'' saidHaruo Fujii, a commentator on military affairs. ``Japan may rely onU.S. technology during the next 10 to 20 years, but Japaneseindustry wants this country to become a military power thatrequires no dependence on Americans.''   Under the present five-year plan Japan's self-defense capabilityis to be raised to enable its armed forces to repulse a ``limited,small-scale'' attack. Japan's 240,000-member Self-Defense Forces isthe only customer for its military industry. Arms exports arebanned, although Japan can transfer defense technology to theUnited States under an accord.   Japan's constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces afterWorld War II, renounces war. The issue of a military buildup issensitive in Japan and in other Asian countries seized by Japaneseforces during the war.</TEXT></DOC>
