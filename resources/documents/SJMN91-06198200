Alan Cranston is mounting a last-ditch defense with the Ethics Committeein hopes of heading off any recommendation that the full Senate punish him forhis role in the Keating Five affair, a congressional source said Monday.Cranston, a California Democrat, reportedly told the committee that if hiscase goes to the Senate floor, he will tell his peers that there was nodifference between their fund-raising efforts and his solicitation of CharlesKeating. If the committee recommends punishment, the Senate basically hasthree options: expulsion, which would be highly unlikely; censure; and removalof a member from positions of responsibility. Keating ran Lincoln Savings andLoan, which failed and left taxpayers with a $2.6 billion bailout bill.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CRANSTON MOUNTS EFFORT TO AVOID PUNISHMENTFOR ROLE IN KEATING CASE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Washington News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910716  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  125  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 16, 199100198200,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
