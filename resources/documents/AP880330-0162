The two men, who made their ascent in five hours usingequipment, were arrested and charged with breaching the peace whenthey descended the 170-foot landmark in Trafalgar Square later inthe day, Greenpeace officials said.   Joe Thompson, 26, and John Stevenson, 30, started their ascenton the column at 4 a.m. and reached the statue of Admiral HoratioNelson, a 19th-century British naval hero, about five hours later.   During their descent, they unfurled a banner reading ``Stop AcidRain'' on the column.   Thompson and Stevenson, both from Sheffield in northern England,used climbing ropes and harnesses. The environmental group wantedto highlight what it considers government complacency over acidrain damage.
