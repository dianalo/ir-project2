<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-0478 </DOCNO><TEXT>The longitudinal propagation velocity of the normal zone was studied inenclosed superconducting wires having a matrix of pure CuNi or a mixtureof Cu and CuNi. The velocity was measured as a function of the externalmagnetic field in the zero to 6 T range under applied transport currentsranging from zero to the critical current. The observed velocities couldbe described by an adaptation of the Dresner model by taking into accountthe extremely short length of the wave front as well as the apparentinhomogeneous current density of the wire due to nonuniform filamentdistribution and limited current diffusion length. Instabilities in thepropagation velocity observed at low fields near the critical currentwere also observed. The instabilities were characterized by temporaryincreases in the velocity by factors between 2 and 100.</TEXT></DOC>
