SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> RALEIGH, N.C.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who came of age in a time of racial violence, declared that he is running for president to end &quot;economic violence,&quot; done by multinational corporations, &quot;merger maniacs&quot; and big defense budgets.    In a long and emotional rally here in the heart of his Southern base, Mr. Jackson seemed to try to dispel any notion that he is a fringe or protest candidate, as many considered him during his first run for the office in 1984. He delivered a message rich in mainstream themes such as patriotism and service to country, and ringing with a basic Democratic call for economic populism.    His supporters, who filled a civic auditorium, picked up the tone. Instead of chanting &quot;Run Jesse Run&quot; as they did four years ago, this time they chanted &quot;Win Jesse Win.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Jackson enters the race as the best known of the Democratic candidates and, in many national polls, the leader of his party's field. To tumultuous cheers from supporters, Mr. Jackson departed from his prepared remarks and attacked the assertion that he leads only because he has more name recognition than candidates who haven't been prominent on the national scene as long.    &quot;That is in part true-high name recognition,&quot; he said. &quot;But I wasn't born with it. I earned it.&quot;    He said his standing might justly be attributed to name recognition if he was a Bostonian named &quot;Jesse Joe Kennedy&quot; or a New Yorker named &quot;Jesse Jay Rockefeller.&quot; But, he said, &quot;I was born . . . to a teenage mother. Nobody knew my name.&quot;    Few give Mr. Jackson a serious chance of winning his party's nomination. But the powerful position he occupies at the outset, and the frequent references in his speech to the &quot;New South,&quot; where he is strong, are potent reminders of the extent to which he will influence the race.    Mr. Jackson appears likely to win many delegates in Southern primaries, which at least will force other candidates to deal with issues he raises. It also means he will be a power center at the Democratic national convention if a nominee hasn't been chosen by then.    Mr. Jackson reiterated his calls for a foreign policy that relies less on military power and more on cooperation with the Third World. He declared a three-part &quot;Jackson Doctrine&quot; calling for strengthening international law, supporting human rights and pushing &quot;international economic justice.&quot;    But his lengthiest remarks dealt with his call for domestic economic justice. &quot;Just as we replaced racial violence with racial justice, we must replace economic violence with economic justice,&quot; he said. &quot;Economic violence is the critical issue of our day.&quot;    He defined economic violence as the closing of plants without notice or the awarding of lucrative &quot;golden parachute&quot; salary packages to business executives while workers are laid off or asked to take pay cuts.    He said the blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs shouldn't be placed on Japanese, Taiwanese or Korean workers, but on multinational corporations who close American plants only to open new ones in foreign lands where there is &quot;slave labor.&quot;    Referring at one point to General Motors Corp. plans for foreign plants, he asserted: &quot;South Korea didn't take jobs from us. GM took jobs to South Korea.&quot;    The answer, he said, lies in retraining American workers, increasing research for commercial development, creating new domestic investment incentives and converting military production plants to civilian use. He again called for using public and private pension funds, secured by the government, for development projects.    Mr. Jackson's speech also signaled that an anti-drug crusade and calls for more drug-interdiction efforts will be prominent features of his campaign. &quot;We have mine sweepers in the Persian Gulf, but there is a great need for drug sweepers in the Gulf of Mexico,&quot; he said.    In many ways, the rally illustrated Mr. Jackson's campaign. It was loose; it ran for some three hours, and Mr. Jackson didn't even begin his own lengthy speech until well after the affair was scheduled to end. He was preceded by a succession of black leaders and representatives from Hispanic, Asian-American, Arab-American, Jewish, Indian and disabled communities, all pledging support for his &quot;Rainbow Coalition.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
