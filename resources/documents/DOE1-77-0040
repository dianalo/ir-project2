For the type of imaging principally studiedhere (diffraction-pattern imaging), the requirements on divergence andmonochromaticity of the illumination are also moderately well understood,and appear to be capable of being sufficiently well met by undulatorbeamlines to permit imaging to the diffraction-limited resolution of{lambda}/2, provided of course that a method of phasing the diffractionpattern is available. It may be remarked that for holography the illuminationrequirements, while varying with the form of holography, are more severethan for diffraction-pattern imaging, while for imaging microscopy theymay be considerably less severe, depending on the angular and frequencybandwidths of the imaging element. It would appear to be for this reasonthat imaging microscopes are currently achieving exposure times of afew seconds even on bending-magnet beamlines.</TEXT></DOC>
