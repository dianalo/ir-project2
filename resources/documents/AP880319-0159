DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan blamed Congress Saturday forthe Nicaraguan border crossing into Honduras, and said rebelsfighting Nicaragua's Marxist-led government ``must have assistancenow.''   In his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office,Reagan made his first substantial statement on Central Americasince he ordered troops airlifted to Honduras on Wednesday.   He said congressional rejection last month of renewed aid forthe Contra rebels in Nicaragua was ``giving the communist dictators... a chance to smash their opponents.''   ``Because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, the Sandinistashave mounted their major cross-border incursion into Honduras,'' hesaid.   ``The freedom fighters are in desperate need of support,'' thepresident added. ``If they are to remain a viable and effectiveforce, they must have assistance now.''   The president spoke as administration officials, on thecondition they not be identified, were saying that Honduranpresident Jose Azcona had asked that U.S. helicopters be used toferry Honduran troops to the fighting zone.   The officials said no decision had been reached, but one saidthe request was likely to be approved, perhaps this weekend.   The New York Times, citing a senior administration official thatit did not identify, reported in Sunday's editions that theadministration already had rejected a proposal to use U.S.helicopters to transport Honduran troops to the battle zone.   The urgency of the Honduran request _ which never was madeformally _ diminished as the Sandinista offensive appeared to winddown, and U.S. officials were able to persuade Honduras to accept amore limited alternative, the Times reported. That alternative wasa joint training exercise in which U.S. helicopters would carryHonduran troops to about 30 miles from the Nicaraguan border but100 miles from the battle zone.   The Hondurans were expected to request the exercise formally,and the United States will agree, the official told the Times.   White House spokeswoman Liz Murphy said late Saturday that nodecisions had been made on whether U.S. helicopters would ferryHonduran troops to or near the border and said all queries shouldbe directed to the Pentagon.   Maj. Bill O'Connell, a Pentagon spokesman, said he knew nothingabout it and Nancy Beck, a State Department spokeswoman, said shehad no comment.   One official, also speaking on condition he not be named, toldThe Associated Press that the Nicaraguan forces were withdrawingfrom Honduras. According to administration estimates, 1,600 to2,000 Sandinista soldiers had crossed the border.   This official said the Contra rebels remained an effectivefighting force, but faced serious short-term supply problems.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the Honduran armed forcesspokesman, said in a telephone interview Saturday that theNicaraguan troops were withdrawing from Honduran territory and thatonly about 600 Sandinista soldiers remained inside Honduras.   ``This is a good sign on the part of the Managua regime, so thatpeace can prevail in Central America,'' he said.   However, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said Saturday nightthat Honduran warplanes had bombed Sandinista positions insideNicaragua in the Bocay region, the same area where Honduran jetshad dropped several bombs on Thursday.   There was no immediate comment on the Nicaraguan report by theHonduran government, but The Washington Post reported in Sunday'seditions that Honduran national radio said the bombings were ofNicaraguan positions in southern Honduras. The radio said the raidswere ordered after U.S. and Honduran intelligence found Nicaraguanslaying mines in 50 square miles of Honduran territory as theywithdrew.   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry spokesman denied that troops weresowing mines in Honduras, the Post reported.   Reagan opened his radio speech with a reference to a jovialget-together on Thursday with congressional leaders, saying,``There was a nice celebration of St. Patrick's Day up on CapitolHill this week; but believe me, that wasn't the only reasonCongress knew I had my Irish up.''   ``Just as the heroic efforts of the democratic resistance haveforced the communists to cut back on their aggression abroad and tomake peace concessions, the Congress in a close vote, decided tocut off aid to the freedom fighters,'' he said.   The president scoffed at the notion that the halt in aidamounted to ``giving peace a chance,'' as some of its supportersargued.   ``Instead,'' he said, ``the aid cutoff is giving the communistdictators a chance, a chance they long hoped for. A chance to smashtheir opponents.''   The president said the Sandinistas had responded by hardeningtheir negotiating posture, firing Cardinal Orlando y Bravo asmediator and sending ``mobs of thugs against peaceful oppositiongroups.''   ``And now, instead of negotiating for a cease-fire, they havelaunched a major military assault on the weakened Contras _invading democratic Honduras in the process,'' he said.   ``Now from the beginning, our Central American policy has beendesigned to prevent another Cuba and to let the people of Nicaraguawin back their freedom and their independence from the Soviet Unionon their own _ to do this without having to commit Americanmilitary personnel,'' Reagan told his radio audience.   ``But now, because of Congress' aid cutoff last month, theSandinistas have mounted their major cross-border incursion intoHonduras,'' he said.   Referring to his dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras to engagein exercises, the president said, ``Our purpose is to send a signalto the governments and peoples of Central America about theseriousness with which we view the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
