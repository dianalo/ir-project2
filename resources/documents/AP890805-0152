To a half-dozen securities professionals convicted in New Yorkand 46 futures traders indicted in Chicago under a tough law aimedat fighting organized crime, ``racketeer'' is like the ghost of AlCapone, a stigma that could plague them for the rest of their lives.   If anyone in the lucrative business of buying and sellingstocks, bonds and commodities still had any illusion they weresomehow exempt from prosecution under this law, they likely weresobered by the events of this past week.   Of particular significance were the New York convictions in theso-called Princeton-Newport case, based on what many attorneys hadcalled confused and even flimsy evidence of fraud.   This showed with dramatic certainty that juries will convictWall Streeters under the racketeering law. It's an ominous sign forsimilar defendants facing trial, especially Michael Milken, theex-junk bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who faces farmore serious charges.   The Princeton-Newport case concerned a now-dissolved investmentfirm called Princeton-Newport Partners. Five of its members andanother ex-Drexel trader were accused of creating phony tax lossesvia prearranged securities trades.   Two days after the Princeton-Newport verdicts, prosecutors inChicago announced long-awaited indictments stemming from a lengthyundercover probe of alleged fraud in the world's largestcommodities markets.   Again using the racketeering law, prosecutors accused the 46defendants of turning the trading pits into their own private clubswhere they reserved the best deals for themselves and tossed thedregs to unsuspecting clients.   Both the Chicago and New York prosecutions represent anaggressive application of the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganization Act or RICO, as it's commonly called. It was enactedby Congress nearly two decades ago to combat gangsters.   The law is considered one of the most powerful enforcement toolsever enacted in this country, enabling prosecutors to seize asuspect's assets before trial and providing for crippling fines andlengthy prison terms upon conviction.   Despite criticism from many lawyers that the law is excessive,its application has expanded over the years to prosecutions ofcriminal defendants ranging from union bosses to motorcycle gangsto politicians.   The RICO acronym, also the name of the Capone-like mobsterplayed by Edward G. Robinson in the 1930 film ``Little Caesar,''was coined by one of the law's authors, G. Robert Blakey, a NotreDame law professor.   ``RICO means crime is called by its correct name,'' Blakey oncesaid. ``If people are running a racket, why shouldn't we try themfor being a racketeer?''   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Convoluted economic reports sent confusing signals into thefinancial markets. The Commerce Department said its chiefforecasting gauge fell 0.1 percent in June, the fourth drop in fivemonths and a strong signal of a slowdown.
