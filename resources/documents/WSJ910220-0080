Keller   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/20/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5</SO><CO>   MOT NT T.NTL BCE T.B</CO><IN>COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CMT)</IN><LP>   Motorola Inc., eager to counter recent inroads by rivals,has formed a cellular equipment alliance with NorthernTelecom Ltd. that could lead to a joint equipment venturebetween the two companies, according to people familiar withthe pact.   While Motorola and Northern Telecom said they will developcellular telephone network equipment to a commoncommunications standard and sell each others equipment, theindividuals said the announcement is the first step in aseries of cooperative efforts that could eventually lead to ajoint venture to co-market and develop cellular equipment inthe U.S. and overseas.</LP><TEXT>   Individuals close to Toronto-based Northern said the twocompanies are discussing such a combination. &quot;But we'rewaiting to see how the current agreement works out beforeexpanding it,&quot; said one executive.   A link between Motorola, the world's largestradio-communications equipment maker, and Northern, a majormaker of digital switching systems and ATandamp;T's main U.S.rival, could pose a major threat to both companies' equipmentrivals.   A Northern connection could also help Motorola, based inSchaumburg, Ill., reverse recent setbacks in which Sweden'sLM Ericsson replaced it as McCaw Cellular CommunicationsCo.'s main supplier and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.won a $700 million deal to equip GTE Corp.'s cellularnetwork.   Motorola, which declined to comment on possible furtherties with Northern, recently struck a similar nonexclusivedevelopment deal with DSC Communications Corp., Plano, Texas-- until recently Motorola's exclusive supplier of switchingequipment for cellular networks.   For now, Motorola and Northern have agreed only to pushequipment with a common standard that would make all cellularphone networks compatible -- thus expanding the availablemarket for Motorola and Northern equipment -- and to selleach other's radio and switching gear wherever appropriate.   Motorola, already the world's largest supplier of cellularradio transmission gear, has never been as much of a force inthe switching arena, choosing instead to draw its switchesfrom outsider DSC.   But as cellular networks continue to grow in complexity,cellular service providers have been forced to seek networkswitches with greater sophistication and capacity than thoseof DSC. This has caused Motorola to lose some orders torivals such as ATandamp;T and Ericsson.</TEXT></DOC>
