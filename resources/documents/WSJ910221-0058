To be sure, most of the half-million allied troops on theground will be Americans. But not since World War II have somany U.S. military units been on the move at the same time ina single battle. The fight for Kuwait will be the mostaudacious attempt since World War II's D-day to synchronize aU.S. ground attack with air and naval bombardment.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, this campaign will require close coordinationwith tens of thousands of Arab troops who speak the enemy'slanguage, and in some cases drive vehicles and field weaponssimilar to Iraq's.   &quot;There's a real risk of a Tower of Babel out there unlessyou work very hard to overcome it,&quot; says retired Gen. EdwardC. Meyer, the Army's former chief of staff. If it isn'tovercome, the result could be disaster.   American soldiers at the front say the wisest course fortheir Arab allies will be to lie low when the action starts.&quot;If they put Egyptian or Syrian tanks on our flank, some ofthem are going to die,&quot; Army Capt. Keith George told histroops last month. &quot;Through a thermal sight, they look justlike Iraqi tanks.&quot;   So, when the shooting starts, most of the nearly 150,000soliders from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and other Muslimcountries will sit firmly on the sidelines. That's partly forpolitical purposes -- the Arab allies have qualms aboutattacking Iraqi territory -- but also for military reasons.Most of the Arab troops are entrenched along the Saudiborder, where they will pin down front-line Iraqi troops.Others will guard prisoners of war at the rear, and stillothers will work with U.S. troops as interpreters. And inKuwait, Arab troops will form the backbone of anyinternational peacekeeping force.   But it is the Americans who will do the heavy lifting,with an assist from the British units integrated into U.S.forces. And it is the British and the Americans who, as theypunch through or outflank Iraqi lines to reach the RepublicanGuard, will take most of the allied casualties.   Yet even among the Americans themselves there almostcertainly will be episodes of deadly confusion. In the heatof battle, friendly units can fire at each other by mistake,especially when a unit gets lost or advances faster thanexpected. It can be difficult to distinguish friendly tanksand planes from hostile tanks and planes. Radio communicationcan fail, especially between ground forces and their airsupport.   &quot;The problems are very difficult,&quot; concedes one top Armyofficial. But, he insists, &quot;We're working at them every day,and we're confident we can overcome them.&quot;   In the air war, the confusion has been easier to handle,yet it still strikes with fatal results. Pilots of allnationalities are trained to speak some English. And thedaily list of bombing missions for all U.S. services, as wellas all allied air forces, is contained in one big document,the Air Tasking Order, issued from Riyadh.   Even so, the air phase of the Gulf war has brought atleast two tragic cases where American ground troops fightingin minor skirmishes were killed by &quot;friendly fire&quot; from U.S.planes and helicopters flying above the battlefield. Indeed,most of the 17 Americans the Pentagon confirms as killed inaction during the air war were felled by &quot;friendly fire.&quot;(Most pilots of downed U.S. planes are formally carried as&quot;missing in action,&quot; rather than &quot;killed.&quot;)   Those and other problems have already forced the Pentagoninto some last-minute attempts at solutions. For instance,some units that lacked the right kind of radio to communicatewith others have been given makeshift gear to try to solvethe problem; nobody is sure they'll hold up for the wholewar.   And, after two Marine armored vehicles were hit by U.S.missiles in a border skirmish, the military placed a rushorder for special tape, which can show up at night onmilitary sensors, to tell pilots which units are friendly.The tape is being hastily plastered on everything from tanksto soldiers' uniforms, but its usefulness in the confused,smoky atmosphere of actual combat hasn't been proven.   The ground war will present far more complicated problemsof command and control. &quot;These guys, all our services and theallies, have got to concentrate hard to get along together onthe battlefield,&quot; says retired Gen. John Wickham, anotherformer Army chief of staff who now heads the Armed ForcesCommunications and Electronics Association, a society ofmilitary command-and-control experts.   &quot;I think the lessons of Grenada have been learned,&quot; Gen.Wickham adds. He is referring to the battlefield confusionthat plagued U.S. forces in 1983 when they invaded the littleCaribbean island.   By comparison with Desert Storm, the Grenada operationshould have been a breeze. It involved a tiny fraction of thenumber of troops, and involved only American forces. Yet thevarious military services found they were using incompatibleradios, had bad maps and couldn't coordinate some keyoperations. In one case, a U.S. Navy bomber attacked a U.S.Army command post, wounding 17 soldiers.   To improve the ground-air coordination, the most criticalaspect of integrated combat operations, Air Force officershave been placed among ground forces. How well they do theirjob will play a major role in determining the success of theallied offensive. Despite the perception that the air warwill somehow end when the ground offensive begins, the U.S.Army plans to attack under the constant protection of theallied air armada, pounding Iraqi forces from the skies.   &quot;Air-ground coordination is going to be the toughestcommand-and-control problem,&quot; says Gen. Meyer. &quot;It's takingplace in furious conflict and uncertainty. And a lot of ourtanks and personnel carriers can be mistaken for theirs inall the smoke.&quot;   ---                      Loud and Clear?
