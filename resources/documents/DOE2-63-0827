The modelis based on the decomposition of the air-gap magnetic flux into counter-rotatingfields. The model equations, whose coefficients are time indipendent,are written on the basis of three-phase voltages and three-phase currentsfor the stator and on the basis of a two-phase representation for therotor, and are considered in the frequency domain. The outlined procedurecan be applied to study electrical transient behaviour with constantspeed. The passage from frequency domain to time domain enables the modelto compute the whole dynamical behaviour of the system.</TEXT></DOC>
