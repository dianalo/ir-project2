In the previous most active year, 1979, 68 species were added.   The list now stands at 993 animals and plants, of which 513 arefound only in foreign countries, the service said in a year-endreport.   One species was removed from the list after confirmation of itslong-suspected extinction _ the Amistad gambusia, a small fishfound in some springs in Texas.   Another species died out during the year, but the paperwork toremove it from the list has not been completed, spokesman DavidKlinger said. This was the dusky seaside sparrow, whose lastsurvivor, an elderly male in captivity, died in Florida.   Among other reasons to call it a good year, the service notedits reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in North Carolina,the growth of the Chesapeake Bay bald eagle population from 136pairs to 161, successful captive breeding of the black-footedferret and establishment of a second population of California seaotters off the coast near Los Angeles.   Too late to make the report was the successful mating of condorsin captivity in California. The service removed the last condorfrom the wild last year on Easter Sunday, and hopes to rebuild thepopulation through breeding in captivity.   Environmentalists have complained that under the Reaganadministration, the service has been moving far too slowly inmaking decisions, and that it will take 16 years or so to workthrough the backlog of about 1,000 candidate species.   They have said that in the last 20 years, 300 species becameextinct while waiting for a decision.   Listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the 1973Endangered Species Act means federal agencies must consult theservice about any of their activities which could harm it. Also,the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan, ofwhich 222 are in effect.</TEXT></DOC>
