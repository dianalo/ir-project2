(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Kenneth Warner left the hospitallast week, he wore a red sweatshirt that proudly said, ``My wifegave me her heart and all her love. Now she gave me a kidney.''   Warner and his wife of 22 years, Roseanne ``Timmie'' Warnerunderwent a rare spouse-to-spouse transplant.   Roseanne Warner, 46, gave one of her kidneys to her 47-year-oldhusband after becoming impatient with a shortage of availablecadaver organs for transplant. The Nov. 29 operation was madepossible by a rare match in the tissues of an unrelated livingdonor and recipient, doctors said.   The couple is recovering well at their home in this Washingtonsuburb, physicians said. Two of their children, Kathleen, 12, andKen Jr., 15, are documenting their progress on home videos.   ``Our big concern was that the kidney would function properly,''Kenneth Warner said.   With anti-rejection drugs increasing the chance of survival forpeople receiving kidneys from donors who are not blood relatives,many doctors view spousal transplants as a way to shorten the waitfor transplants.   As of Monday, there were 280 people in the Washington area onthe waiting list for kidney transplants, according to theWashington Regional Transplant Consortium.   Most transplant organs come from cadavers. But fewer areavailable because of better care for people who a few years agowould have died from their injuries, said Jimmy Light, chairman oftransplantation at the Washington Hospital Center, where theWarners had their surgery.   Of those who do die and are medically suitable for organharvesting, only about 50 percent of their families give consent,compared with 83 percent two years ago.   Kenneth Warner had those statistics to consider after both hiskidneys failed in May. Warner, a maintenance supervisor for theNational Security Agency, was given kidney dialysis treatmentsthree times a week, but didn't want to stay on dialysis for therest of his life.   He decided he wanted a transplant kidney, and set Christmas ashis personal deadline.   The couple's oldest daughter, Kelly Ann, a 19-year-old collegestudent, volunteered her kidney. But Roseanne Warner recalleddiscussing a spousal organ transplant with a doctor.   The Warners ``woke up on a Saturday morning and I said `Whycan't I give you a kidney?''' the secretary said.   In a series of sophisticated tissue-typing tests to determinethe kind of match Roseanne Warner's kidney would make with herhusband's body, doctors determined that of the six tissue types,the couple matched on three.   The chances of that happening between husband and wife are aboutone in 2,000, Light said.</TEXT></DOC>
