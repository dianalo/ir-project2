But the explosion that wrecked a bar four hours before theApprentice Boys' Parade, causing no injuries, underlined tensionsas Northern Ireland approaches the 20th anniversary of the Britishgovernment's decision to send in troops.   It was the Apprentice Boys' Parade in 1969 that touched offrioting in Roman Catholic areas and led to troops arriving in theprovince on Aug. 14, 1969.   Saturday's bomb, said marcher Robert Kerr, ``means we have nosecurity.''   ``For the amount of money they're spending, we should get bettersecurity,'' said Kerr, who drove 60 miles from his farm nearDungannon to join the parade.   ``(The bomb) was only a small sample of what we've had,'' addedWilliam Coulter of Londonderry.   Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a ButcherStreet bar. It had been discovered by security forces who evacuatedthe area, but it exploded before army experts could defuse it, saida spokesman who refused to be named.   The explosion shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys MemorialHall, but no one was hurt.   ``It will not stop us. It will not dampen our spirits in anyway,'' said Derek Miller, general secretary of the Apprentice Boysorganization.   A statement released by the IRA said the bomb was timed to gooff when security forces were in the area. By planting the device,the statement said, the IRA proved it could strike despite heavysecurity.   The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British out of theprovince.   On Friday night, police said they seized a bomb packed with 10pounds of Semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in theCatholic Creggan neighborhood of Londonderry.   There was heavy security along the parade route across the broadRiver Foyle and through the picturesque walled city, with dozens ofgray armored police vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrollingin full combat gear.   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, a British police force, however,reported that the parade pased without incident.   Before the parade, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. James Kane,told worshipers at St. Columb's Anglican Cathedral it would bewrong to provoke sectarian passions.   ``Rather we should endeavour to teach our fellow countrymen tolook at the past in a calm and kindly spirit, to rise superior tothe passions of the ages ...'' Kane said.   The parade was a rich mixture of politics and religion, withbands marching to such tunes as ``Abide with Me'' and ``Stand Up,Stand Up for Jesus'' to a martial beat.   Londonderry has long been a place of mythic significance toProtestants as the scene of a 15-week siege in 1689 by the forcesof the exiled Catholic King James II, who had been ousted in favorof the Protestant William of Orange, the Dutch-born prince whoruled Britain jointly with his English wife and cousin, Mary.   The ``no surrender'' spirit of the apprentice boys who slammedthe city gates to prevent their leader from capitulating lives onas a political slogan for the so-called Loyalist side _ the largesegment of the Protestant community that supports British rule.   Aug. 12 is the day the siege was lifted.   Londonderry was a focus of the Catholic civil rights marches ofthe 1960s because of the blatant gerrymandering that perpetuatedthe Protestant minority's control of local government.   Even the name is contentious: to loyalists it is Londonderry, tonationalists it is Derry. Once Catholics gained control of thelocal council, it became the Derry District Council.   The Catholic community plans its own march Monday evening,followed by a speech by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a prominentfirebrand of the republican movement in the 1960s.   The current IRA campaign dates from the turbulent days afterBritish troops arrived. The Provisional Irish Republican Army brokeaway from the old IRA organization to wage guerrilla war on theBritish Army and other targets.   British troops in the province currently number more than10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in1972.   They are backed by 6,500 members of the Ulster Defense Regiment,a locally recruited unit of the British Army.   Since the troops arrived, more than 2,700 people have been slain.</TEXT></DOC>
