Furthermore, there will beno adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign based enterprises in domestic or import markets. This actionis not expected to substantially affect budget outlay or affect more thanone agency or to be controversial. The net result is to provide betterservice to rural communities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background/Discussion </ITAG>On July 25, 1988, FmHA published a proposed rule (53 FR 27863) on SFH loanmaking and management of inventory property. FmHA now publishes these proposedrevisions for final rule. In addition, FmHA is making changes to implementprovisions of recent legislation and to include two cross reference andclarification changes in its SFH security servicing regulations. On September 14, 1988, FmHA published an interim final rule (with requestfor comments) (53 FR 35638) pursuant to the Agricultural Credit Act of1987 which include changes to 7 CFR Part 1955. That rulemaking action primarilyaffects farmer program (CONACT) portions of the aforementioned Part. Thisrulemaking action primarily affects housing borrowers/properties and hasno impact on the intent or changes in 7 CFR Part 1955 as a result of theAgricultural Credit Act of 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected </ITAG>These programs/activities are listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance under Nos:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>  </H1><H1>  </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">10.410 <D>Low income housing loans. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.411 <D>Rural housing site loans. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.415 <D>Rural rental housing loans. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.417 <D>Very low income housing repair loans and grants. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.427 <D>Rural rental assistance payments. </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V, 10.410 and 10.417 and are excluded from the scopeof Executive Order 12372 which requires Intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials. The remaining programs are subject to intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement </ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-90, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This final rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The undersigned has determinedand certified by signature of this document that this rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiessince this rulemaking action does not directly involve small entities nordoes it add/remove any authorities which would affect small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27863) on July 25, 1988, provided fora 60-day comment period. Nine comments were received during the 60-daycomment period. Four comments were received shortly after the comment period,and although received late, were considered in developing this final rule.Of the 13 comments, 12 were from housing advocacy groups relating to FmHAproposal to make single family houses available for lease to communitybased organizations to shelter the homeless. One comment was received relatingto historic preservation as it relates to inventory property. No commentswere received from Agency personnel. The following is a summary of thecomments by section number: Part 1944_Subpart A <T3>Section 1944.17(f)</T3>_This section deals with making subsequent Section502 loans for essential repairs even though the subsequent loan may causethe total indebtedness to exceed the market value of the security. No commentswere received. Therefore, the Agency adopts the proposed rule. Part 1955_Subpart B <T3>Section 1955.55(e)</T3>_This section deals with off-site procurements.No comments were received. Therefore, the Agency adopts the proposed rule,however, it has been renumbered to andSection; 1955.55(f). <T3>Section 1955.60</T3>_This section deals with redemption rights. Nocomments were received. Therefore, the Agency adopts the proposed rule.<T3>Section 1955.61</T3>_This section deals with evictions of persons occupyinginventory property. No comments were received. Therefore, the Agency adoptsthe proposed rule. <T3>Section 1955.63(c)</T3>_This section deals with the suitability determinationof single family housing property. No comments were received. Therefore,the Agency adopts the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1955.64</T3>_This section deals with the repair policy of housingproperty. A comment was received regarding andSection; 1955.64(a). The commentorsuggested that FmHA provide guidance on how a servicing official can identifyhistoric property. Guidance on making this determination is currently containedin andSection; 1955.137 of Subpart C of Part 1955. FmHA concurs that guidanceshould be provided in andSection; 1955.64(a) and has included a referenceto andSection; 1955.137(b). A comment was received regarding FmHA policy,as it relates to historic property, of not repairing property defined as``Nonprogram (NP)'' unless the cost of repairs would increase the marketvalue of the property by at least the cost of the repairs. FmHA policyis not to repair any NP property unless the repairs will increase the marketvalue by a like amount. However, the regulation has been expanded to clarifythat FmHA will make necessary repairs to preserve the historic integrityof properties that are or are not eligible for listing on the NationalRegister of Historic Places. <T3>Section 1955.66</T3>_This section deals with leasing SFH inventoryproperty. A commentor suggests that FmHA include in this section a provisionon the leasing of historic properties to protect their historic integrity.FmHA concurs with this recommendation and has adopted same. <T3>Section 1955.72</T3>_This section deals with utilization of inventoryproperty by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or by publicbodies and nonprofit organizations to shelter the homeless. With one exception,all the comments received on this proposed rule dealt with utilizationof FmHA single family housing inventory property by the homeless. The commentscan be summarized into nine separate areas which are addressed as follows:1. The first comment addresses Exhibit C to 7 CFR Part 1955, Subpart B.This exhibit was not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, however, it can be obtained at any FmHA office.The commentors recommend this exhibit be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The exhibit contains a fact sheet, the Agency'sMemorandum of Understanding with the Department of Health and Human Servicesregarding the availability of FmHA properties for lease by public bodiesand nonprofit organizations to provide transitional housing for the homeless,and a sample lease form. FmHA intention in not publishing this exhibitis to provide the necessary flexibility to administer such a program. Thebulk of the exhibit is a sample lease. Leases vary from state to state.If a lease were published as a section of the subject regulation, no changescould be made to the sample without proper clearances. If the lease didnot comply with a State law or contained a provision inconsistent withthe intent of the lease, FmHA could not revise it without a lengthy andformal clearance process which could take several months and effectivelyprevent the utilization of property by the homeless. Through our networkof over 2,000 local FmHA offices, we believe that the exhibit is readilyavailable to the public, and provides the flexibility and responsivenessnecessary to administer this program. Therefore, the Agency does not adoptthis suggestion. Based upon comments received, FmHA has broadened the information containedin the exhibit. The exhibit references changes (as addressed in this rulemakingdocument) and specifically addresses responsibilities of FmHA and the publicbody or nonprofit organization to ensure success of the program. Due tointervening amendments made to Subpart B, the information which was containedin proposed Exhibit C is now contained in Exhibit D. 2. The second comment deals with FmHA intention to make available for leaseto public bodies and nonprofit organizations to provide transitional housingfor the homeless only properties which have been defined by the Agencyas ``Nonprogram (NP).'' The commentors believe that FmHA should make bothprogram and nonprogram (NP) units available for lease under this program.The purpose of the FmHA program is to provide financial assistance to programapplicants with very-low, low, or moderate income to purchase adequatebut modest housing in rural areas. Although there is no statutory requirementto do so, FmHA believes program properties should be made available forpurchase by program applicants. This policy is strongly supported by housingadvocacy groups. This furthers the objectives of the Section 502 ruralhousing program. Making program properties available for extended leaseswould remove these properties from the housing stock for potential applicants.Accordingly, FmHA does not adopt this comment. However, FmHA will sella program property to a public body or nonprofit organization for shelterfor the homeless and provide such entities with the same preference asa program purchaser. 3. The third comment deals with FmHA proposal to lease properties to publicbodies and nonprofit organizations for a period not to exceed three years.Commentors recommended the period be extended from three to ten or fifteenyears. This would permit use of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) transitionalhousing funds to cover operating costs, for which a 10-year lease is required.FmHA concurs with this comment, and will make properties available forlease up to 10 years. 4. The fourth comment deals with FmHA proposal to require the sponsor tobring the property to habitable condition, if not already habitable, beforeit can be utilized to shelter the homeless. The first concern was due tothe proposed length of the lease (proposed for three years), which wouldnot provide sponsors with the opportunity to recover such costs. The secondconcern had to do with the sponsors financial ability to make such repairs,possibly making the program unworkable. As mentioned above, FmHA will nowmake these properties available for lease for up to 10 years, thereforemaking recovery of repair costs feasible. In addition, FmHA will bear thecosts of removing any health or safety hazards from the property priorto formally executing a lease. The sponsor will be responsible for cosmetic-typerepairs such as painting, floor covering, etc. 5. The fifth comment deals with FmHA making inventory properties availablefor sale to public bodies and nonprofit organizations. The subject proposedrulemaking action only dealt with making properties available for lease,not sale, Therefore, FmHA will not address this comment at this time, butwill propose another rulemaking action in the very near future to addresssale of inventory property to shelter the homeless. In the interim, thereis nothing to preclude a public body or nonprofit organization from purchasingFmHA inventory property under the sale provisions contained in SubpartC of Part 1955 of this chapter. Some of the suggested additions to oursale procedures to facilitate this program include: a special retentiontime for which (program or nonprogram) inventory properties are held exclusivelyfor sale to public bodies and nonprofit organizations; a discount of 10percent off the price at which the property was most recently offered forsale: payment of all closing costs of the transferee (the purchaser) byFmHA; priority to occupants of these properties to obtain FmHA financingshould the sponsor desire to sell same; no program or nonprogram inventoryproperties should be sold to other than program applicants or public bodiesand nonprofit organizations until after referral to HUD for a determinationof whether the property should be made available to the homeless; a fiftyyear repayment plan, availability of two percent of the mortgage amountfor transfer costs, reduced interest rates, and no down payment requirementwhen the sale is to a public body or nonprofit organization.6. The sixth comment suggests that FmHA develop and maintain a list ofcommunity based organizations interested in obtaining such properties forlease, purchase or conversion for the benefit of very-low, low-income orhomeless persons and families, and notify such organizations of the availabilityof FmHA inventory properties. While FmHA is interested in working withsuch organizations and public bodies, we believe such an entity shouldmake contact with FmHA if they are interested in our inventory property.In Fiscal Year 1988, FmHA acquired approximately 15,000 single family dwellings.To notify all public bodies and nonprofit organizations of all availableFmHA inventory property would be burdensome on FmHA personnel and the publicbody or nonprofit organization if there was no need for such properties.Each of our approximately 2000 county offices is aware of inventory propertiesavailable for sale and/or lease in the County Office area and will providea list of such properties upon request from a public body or nonprofitorganization. To create a constant stream of paperwork from FmHA to theseentities does not appear to be cost or time effective for either party.FmHA stands ready and willing to assist any such entity which desires topurchase or lease an FmHA inventory property. Therefore, this comment isnot adopted.7. The seventh comment relates to prohibitions against the use of otherfederal funds or public monies in acquiring, leasing or otherwise makinguse of FmHA inventory units to shelter the homeless. There was no suchprohibitions in the proposed rule nor do we intend to create same in thisfinal rulemaking action. FmHA strongly supports the utilization of otherpublic monies, or private funds, to support this endeavor.8. The eighth comment centers around one of the conditions of the proposedsample lease of FmHA inventory property to public bodies and nonprofitorganizations. The sample lease states that such properties will provide``temporary'' housing for the homeless in rural areas. The commentor recommendsthat FmHA impose use restrictions on the sale of properties for low incomeand homeless persons and families, but that no such restrictions be imposedin any lease. FmHA partially concurs with this comment. We concur thatthe term, ``temporary housing for the homeless,'' may be too restrictive,however, having no use restrictions in a lease could invite abuse and leavethe Agency and the public body or nonprofit organization open to potentialcriticism. FmHA will amend the lease to limit the use of the property toprovide transitional housing for the homeless. Comments concerning thesale of property are not appropriate to this rulemaking action, but wewill consider the comment in the development of our proposed rulemakingaction on the sale of the subject properties. Under present rules, if apublic body or nonprofit organization wants to purchase a FmHA inventoryproperty, no use restrictions are imposed.9. The ninth comment suggested that FmHA provide technical assistance grantsto public bodies and nonprofit organizations to implement this program.While FmHA concurs that public bodies and nonprofit organizations may needtechnical assistance to make this a successful endeavor and is pleasedto make properties available to achieve this goal, there are no appropriationsfor this purpose; therefore, FmHA cannot adopt this comment.10. A final comment was received relating to advertising and sale of FmHAinventory property in the State of Alabama. Although the subject rulemakingaction does not address sale provisions or advertising practices of theAgency, contained in 7 CFR Part 1955, Subpart C, the comment is considered.The commentor's first concern is that FmHA is not providing, through realestate brokers, sufficient outreach or advertising to reach minority applicantsfor the purchase of inventory property. All open listing agreements andexclusive broker contracts between FmHA and real estate brokers containNondiscrimination Certifications. The Nondiscrimination Certification requiresreal estate brokers to follow ``Fair Housing'' guidelines; train agentsin nondiscrimination policies and laws; utilize minority media when advertisingFmHA properties for sale in predominantly white neighborhoods; and follownondiscriminatory hiring policies. All advertising is required to containthe ``Equal Opportunity Housing'' logo. FmHA regulations (andSection;1955.146(c)),require special efforts to reach minority purchasers. When FmHA lists fiveor more properties for sale under an exclusive listing agreement in thesame subdivision, an ``Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan'' is required.The commentor's second concern is that real estate brokers are discouragingsales to minority purchasers. No specific cases were mentioned, thereforeFmHA could not investigate; however, the commentor stated they called realestate brokers handling FmHA inventory property sales and requested a listof all FmHA inventory properties available for sale. The brokers respondedby recommending that the potential purchaser identify the area in whichthey desire to purchase a property and then recontact the broker to determineif any property is available. It is common practice for a real estate brokerto ask a purchaser to identify his or her requirements in order to locateand show only those properties which would meet them. FmHA does not findreasonable cause for concern over these comments; however, we offer thefollowing statistics to support this finding. According to the 1980 census,twenty-six percent of the residents of Alabama are minority. For the fiscalyear ending September 30, 1988, forty-three percent of all FmHA SFH loansmade in Alabama were to minorities. For that same period, forty-five percentof all FmHA credit sales in Alabama were made to minorities.In addition to the aforementioned revisions, FmHA is also making the followingcross-reference amendments and clarifications to Subpart C of Part 1965:1. In andSection; 1965.104(b)(3), a cross-reference is made to the revisionmade in this rulemaking action to Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapterregarding subsequent SFH loans.2. In andSection; 1965.105(b)(2) regarding payment of taxes by FmHA on behalfof the borrower, there is insufficient guidance provided on how these taxesare amortized. Although andSection; 1965.105 contains a paragraph on amortizingthe tax voucher, there is no specific reference to this paragraph in paragraph(b)(2). Accordingly, we have included a cross-reference to clarify thissection. This amendment was not proposed for rulemaking since it is merelyan administrative cross-reference insertion.3. In andSection; 1965.104(e)(2) regarding amortizing tax vouchers, thereis no cross-reference to Subpart G of Part 1951 of this chapter. SubpartG contains SFH servicing regulations and provisions on amortizing vouchers.Accordingly, we have included a cross-reference to clarify this subparagraph.This amendment was not proposed for rulemaking since it is merely an administrativecross-reference insertion.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 1944Grant programs_Housing and community development, Home improvement, Loanprograms_Housing and community development, Low and moderate income housing_Rental,Mobile homes, Mortgages, Rural housing, Subsidies.7 CFR Part 1955Government acquired property, Government property management.7 CFR Part 1965Administrative practice and procedure, Loan programs, Housing and communitydevelopment, Low and moderate income housing_Rental, Rural areas.Therefore, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1944_HOUSING</ITAG>1.

Sections 1955.60 and 1955.61 are revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1955.60</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Inventory property subject to redemption by the borrower.</ITAG>If inventory property is subject to redemption rights, the State Director,with prior approval of OGC, will issue a State Supplement giving guidanceconcerning the former borrower's rights, whether or not the property maybe leased or sold by the Government, payment of taxes, maintenance, andany other items OGC deems necessary to comply with State laws. Routinecare and maintenance will be provided according to andSection; 1955.64 ofthis subpart to preserve and protect the property. Repairs are limitedto those essential to prevent further deterioration of the property orto remove a health or safety hazard to the community in accordance withandSection; 1955.64(a) of this subpart unless State law permits full recoveryof cost of repairs in which case usual policy on repairs is applicable.If the former borrower with redemption rights has possession of the propertyor has a right to lease proceeds, FmHA will not rent the property untilthe redemption period has expired unless the State Director obtains priorauthorization from OGC. Further guidance on sale subject to redemptionrights is set forth in andSection; 1955.138 of Subpart C of this Part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1955.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Eviction of persons occupying inventory real property or dispossessionof persons in possession of chattel property.</ITAG>Advice and assistance will be obtained from OGC where eviction from realtyor dispossession of chattel property is necessary. Where OGC has givenwritten authorization, eviction may be effected through State courts ratherthan Federal courts when the former borrower is involved, or through localcourts instead of Federal/State courts when the party occupying/possessingthe FmHA property is not the former borrower. In those cases, a State Supplementwill be issued to provide explicit instructions. For MFH, eviction of tenantswill be handled in accordance with Subpart L of Part 1944 of this chapterand with the terms of the tenant's lease. If no written lease exists, theState Director will obtain advice from OGC.6. In andSection; 1955.63, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1955.63</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Suitability determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(c) <T3>Housing property.</T3> Property which secured housing loans will beclassified as ``program'' or ``nonprogram (NP).'' After a determinationof whether the property is suited for retention in the respective program,the repair policy outlined in andSection; 1955.64(a) of this subpart willbe followed. In determining whether a property is suited for retentionin the program, items such as size, design, possible health and/or safetyhazards and obsolescence due to functional, economic, or locational conditionsmust carefully be considered. Generally, program property will meet, orcan be realistically repaired to meet, the standards for existing housingoutlined in Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapter except the requirementsrelating to size and/or design features will not be considered providedthe property is typical of modest homes in the area. The cost of repairswill generally not be considered in determining suitability. Since houses,sites and locations vary widely throughout the country, discretion andsound judgment must be used in determining suitability. The majority ofhouses FmHA acquires will be suited for retention and classified as programproperty. In some instances, property will not be suited for retentionin the program and will be classified as ``nonprogram (NP)'' property.Situations of this type include, but are not limited to:(1) A dwelling which has been enlarged or improved to the point where itis clearly above modest in size, design and/or cost.(2) When a determination is made that the property should not have beenfinanced originally.(3) A dwelling brought into the program as an existing dwelling which metprogram standards at the time it was originally financed by FmHA but whichdoes not conform to current policies. This includes older and/or largerhouses of a type which have proven to create excessive energy and/or maintenancecosts to very-low and low-income borrowers.(4) A dwelling which is obsolete due to location, design, constructionor age.(5) A dwelling which requires major redesign/renovation to be brought toprogram standards.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>7.

If realproperty (exclusive of improvements) is unsafe, refer to andSection; 1955.137(e)of Subpart C of Part 1955 of this Part for further guidance. Substantialimprovement or repair of property located in a flood or mudslide hazardarea is subject to the limitation outlined in Exhibit C, Paragraph 3b (1)and (2) of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, and andSection; 1955.56of this subpart.(a) <T3>Basic repair policy. </T3>After a determination of suitability is made,repairs will be accomplished in accordance with the following provisions.Properties that are listed or are eligible for listing on the NationalRegister of Historic Places, in whole or in part (see andSection; 1955.137(b)of Subpart C of this Part), will be repaired as necessary to protect theirhistoric integrity after consultation with the State Historic PreservationOfficer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation regarding anyrepairs. Also, if any property presents a health or safety hazard, exceptSFH or MFH properties to be sold with ``Decent, Safe and Sanitary'' (DSS)clauses, necessary steps will be taken to remove the hazard, and if necessary,after seeking advice from appropriate agencies having related expertiseor jurisdiction.(1) <T3>SFH._</T3>(i) <T3>Program property</T3>. Program property will be repaired, renovated,and/or improved as necessary to meet program standards for existing housing,to enhance buyer appeal, and make the maximum recovery on the Government'sinvestment, with the objective being to sell the property at the earliesttime possible. Attention should be given to the interior and exterior ofthe structure(s), landscaping, driveways, walks, and other site improvementswhich will enhance marketability. Exceptions to this policy are authorizedonly when a prospective program applicant has indicated a willingness tobuy a specific property ``as-is'' and make needed repairs with his/herown resources or with a subsequent loan made simultaneously with the creditsale. In areas where severe vandalism is prevalent, the State Directoris authorized to waive the repair policy in specific locations when theCounty Supervisor requests the waiver based upon documentation to supportthe request. In these cases a subsequent loan for the cost of repairs maybe made in conjunction with the credit sale. A ``Neighborhood Watch'' programor similar effort should be considered to reduce vandalism.(ii) <T3>Nonprogram (NP) property. </T3>NP property should be cleaned, freeof trash (dwelling and lot), and made presentable to enhance marketability.Repairs will generally not be made unless they increase the ``as-is'' marketvalue by at least the cost of repairs.
