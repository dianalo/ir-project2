RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush has little chance of winning acontemplated court battle if he exercises a line-item veto withoutcongressional authorization, legal scholars say.   While the move may be politically appealing, these experts say,the Constitution and legal precedent offer scant support for suchuse of presidential power.   ``It's kind of a dead duck,'' said Georgetown University lawprofessor Charles Abernathy. ``I'm surprised anyone in the WhiteHouse would float that.''   Bush, as did President Reagan before him, supports aconstitutional amendment permitting him to veto individual items ina bill while leaving the rest intact.   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush may notwait _ may choose to veto an item in some bill ``to see if itworks.''   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable testcase, but at this point we don't have one,'' Fitzwater said.   The proposal has never been popular with Congress, whose membersprefer to bargain for favorite programs without the threat ofpresidential interference.   A line-item veto ``is an idea that many of us would resist verydiligently,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of HouseJudiciary Committee's civil and constitutional rights subcommittee.   Although the Supreme Court has never addressed theconstitutional issue head-on, debate over the legitimacy of theline-item veto is nothing new.   The first hint of the controversy may have arisen when PresidentThomas Jefferson nearly two centuries ago temporarily blocked a$50,000 appropriation by Congress for 15 gunboats on theMississippi River.   President Richard M. Nixon used a similar tactic when heimpounded federal funds allocated to the states to fight waterpollution. But six months after Nixon left office, the SupremeCourt in 1975 ruled unanimously that he had exceeded his authority.   The court said withholding the money Congress had voted to spendwas not authorized by law.   Abernathy, the Georgetown professor, said the 1975 decision hasa bearing on the line-item veto.   ``The court held there was no authorization by law for thepresident not to spend money Congress had appropriated. Theline-item veto is the same thing,'' he said.   Other scholars agree.   ``This is truly an easy question,'' said Duke University lawprofessor Walter Dellinger. ``The president has the authority toveto bills. He does not have any authority to veto part of anybills. The president's power is to accept or reject whatever billsCongress submits. It's not an authority to rewrite legislation.''   Adds American University law professor Thomas Sargentich, whospecializes in separation of powers issues: ``There isn't a firmcase on the line-item veto because people have assumed it can't bedone.''   Sargentich said the Constitution gives the president ``an up ordown vote on the entire bill just as the Congress has to vote up ordown on the bill. There's no indication in history that wouldpermit selective alteration by the president.''   Advocates argue that the line-item veto is needed in time ofrunaway budget deficits to curb congressional excesses andpork-barrel legislation.   So-called Christmas tree bills that hand out a wide range ofunrelated goodies violate the intent of the Constitution's framersto limit legislation to specific subjects, they say.   Dan Popeo of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said atest case could be won if ``Bush has the backbone'' to force theconfrontation.   Popeo was unable to cite any court ruling to support hisprediction, but said a legal showdown over the line-item veto is``a good bet for George Bush.''   ``The legislative branch puts itself at great risk by allowingthe judiciary to review its powers,'' Popeo said.   The National Academy of Public Administration, a non-partisanresearch group, said in a study released last year that theline-item veto, if ever adopted, could backfire.   It would increase political confrontations and send lawmakerssearching for ways to neutralize it, the academy said.   ``The item veto is not a simple, politically neutral device forbringing about economy and efficiency in government. It is firstand foremost a political instrument,'' the group said.   The constitutions of 43 states permit governors to use suchvetoes. But in many cases the provisions are coupled with arequirement for a balanced state budget.   Most states have come up with various ways of softening theimpact of the line-item veto, such as permitting the legislature torecall a bill for a compromise adjustment.   Some critics of the Bush administration think the president maybe willing to exercise a line-item veto despite doubts over itsconstitutional validity because any legal challenge might not reachthe Supreme Court for years.   ``Conservatives could have a field day,'' said Rep. Edwards.``They think they could get several years of line-item vetoes.''</TEXT></DOC>
