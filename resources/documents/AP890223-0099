In a speech to Egyptian political leaders at the end of afour-day visit, Shevardnadze also made what he called his ``firstcritical remark about the new president of the United States,''saying George Bush was trying unjustly to limit the Soviet role inthe Middle East.   His comments about Soviet ties with Israel, where were severed byMoscow during the 1967 Middle East war, came one day after he metwith Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Cairo.   ``We would like the government of Israel to know that once itopts for the conference and agrees to a dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization, our two countries could take yet anotherstep toward re-establishing full diplomatic relations,'' he said.``The beginning of the conference would be a starting point forresumed relations.''   On Wednesday, Arens rejected the idea of a conference with thePLO. However, he told reporters afterward the Soviets have a role toplay in Middle East peacemaking even without diplomatic ties withIsrael.   However, in Paris today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israelsaid the Soviet Union must first establish normal relations withIsrael before it can play a role in solving the Mideast conflict.   ``We wait for this act on the part of Moscow,'' Shamir told anews conference. ``I hope it will be forthcoming.''   In Jerusalem, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saidtoday that Arens and Shevardnadze agreed to expand their nations'relations through delegations that will meet in the next few weeks.A Foreign Ministy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidwithout elaboaration that the delegations will focus on the MiddleEast conflict.   Israel's Hadashot newspaper said Arens and Shevardnadze alsoagreed to advance ties by making the consular offices in eachcountry permanent.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat today said in Cairo the Soviet Union'snew dialogue with Israel is giving him a channel for ``indirectnegotiations'' with Israel.   Speaking to reporters one day after he met with Shevardnadze,Arafat rejected direct negotiations between Israel and the PLOoutside of the proposed international peace conference.   In today's speech, Shevardnadze warned Israel that it ``has noright to deny freedom of choice to the Palestinian people.''   ``Unless a peaceful, comprehensive political settlement is found... developments in the region would follow a spiral wound by thelogic of military confrontation,'' he said. ``The region faces thethreat of an arms race which sooner or later would degenerate into anuclear face-off.''   Shevardnadze alluded to Israel's reported possession of asubstantial nuclear arsenal and possible efforts by Arab states toacquire nuclear or chemical weapons.   The speech appeared to sum up his visits to Syria, Jordan andEgypt. He later left for Iraq and planned to visit Iran beforereturning home.   Shevardnadze was in Egypt when Bush made remarks Tuesdayrelegating the Soviet Union to a ``limited role'' in the Middle East.   ``He made a qualification that I didn't like. He said the role ofthe Soviet Union should be limited. That is very sad because itinjects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary,'' Shevardnadzesaid.   He added with as smile: ``This is my first critical remark aboutthe president of the United States.''   Shevardnadze spoke in Russian, and Arabic and Englishtranslations of his remarks were available.   Shevardnadze over the weekend unveiled a Soviet proposal that thefive permanent members of the U.N. Security Council prepare for aninternational conference to negotiate an Arab-Israeli peacesettlement.   The PLO would attend as a full partner.</TEXT></DOC>
