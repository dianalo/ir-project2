(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Control Data Corp. said it plans tosell its unprofitable South African subsidiary to Unidev Ltd., aSouth African holding company for an undisclosed amount.   ``While we continue to be committed to contributing to socialchange in South Africa, the long-term economic viability of thebusiness can be better served with South African ownership,'' RobertPrice, Control Data's chairman, said Wednesday.   Control Data, which began operations in South Africa in 1964,will maintain a legal entity in South Africa for continuing severaleducation and community development initiatives, funded by apermanent trust, the company said.   Control Data withdrew only from owning a subsidiary in SouthAfrica, not from doing business there. Control Data will continue tosell computers and services to South African customers throughUnidev, said Frank Ryan a Control Data spokesman.   The company's Johannesburg-based subsidiary accounted for lessthan 1 percent of the company's 1987 revenue of $3.4 billion, Ryansaid.   The company's business involvement with South Africa had inrecent years generated considerable criticism from church groups andsome pension funds opposing South Africa's racially separateapartheid society.   Groups that owned stock in the company used Control Data's annualstockholders' meetings as a forum for their protests.   As a result of its continuing indirect presence in South Africa,the pressure on Control Data from antiapartheid groups may be easedbut not stopped.   Many church groups, colleges and others who have joined thedivestment movement as a means to end apartheid are demanding thatcompanies not just sell their South African operations but that theycut ties altogether.   Control Data South Africa's 123 employees will be transferred toUnidev under the terms of the agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
