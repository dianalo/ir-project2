Instead, the president reiterated that the goals of his Iranian policy were &quot;worthy&quot; and asserted that only in the execution &quot;serious mistakes were made.&quot;    In his first major public appearance since Nov. 25, when the Iran-Contra controversy erupted, the president struck a note of cooperation with Congress, but not contrition. He tried to reassure the public that despite the recent imbroglio, which has threatened his credibility, and despite his own recent health problems, which have raised questions about his ability to lead, he has a full legislative agenda.    In fact, while the president kept his address thematic and short, partly for health reasons, he supplemented it with a lengthy list of specific legislative proposals -- most of which he has made before -- entitled &quot;A Quest for Excellence.&quot;    &quot;Much is at stake here,&quot; he said, &quot;and the nation and the world are watching -- to see if we go forward in the national interest, or if we let partisanship weaken us.&quot; The nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress was interrupted by applause 38 times, although at some points Democrats laughed mockingly, most notably when the president called for balancing the budget.    While the president's speech broke little new ground, it was a ringing affirmation of the direction and priorities he has chosen during the past six years, which he said have brought peace, lowered inflation and &quot;made the world safer,&quot; though he added, &quot;it is still not safe yet.&quot; A White House aide said: &quot;If it sounds old, in many ways that's what we wanted -- to show people that he's the same old Ronald Reagan.&quot;    Rather than playing down the realm of foreign policy, as some advisers had proposed in the weeks following the Iran fiasco, President Reagan renewed his commitment to the Contra rebels fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.    &quot;Here especially,&quot; he said, &quot;the world is watching to see how the nation responds.&quot; Rather than calling outright for more military aid for the rebels, however, Mr. Reagan vowed: &quot;I will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom. There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America.&quot;    Mr. Reagan trumpeted such favorite themes as the threat posed by Soviet expansion and the need for a stronger U.S. defense. He also reiterated his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative -- the so-called Star Wars plan -- but stopped short of calling for near-term deployment of the program, which Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger recently has been advocating.    The president's address offered little more than rhetoric on two fronts that polls show the public most concerned about: arms control and deficit reduction. &quot;The federal deficit is outrageous,&quot; Mr. Reagan declared. At the same time, however, he continued to oppose tax increases or cuts in defense spending, asking again, as he has asked unsuccessfully in the past, for Congress to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and to give him authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills.    Mr. Reagan also challenged Congress to stick to the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction timetable, calling the budget process &quot;a sorry spectacle.&quot; He stopped short, however, of calling in his speech for reform of the budget process, an initiative that had been personally promoted last fall by Donald Regan, the White House chief of staff.    In the realm of domestic policy, the president reaffirmed his support for several initiatives begun during the past year. And he added to them a new push for global &quot;competitiveness&quot; aimed at keeping America's edge in the global marketplace by raising educational standards, safeguarding fair trade, and making almost a $1 billion commitment to new job-training programs, as already specified in the president's budget message.    Although the president gave rhetorical support to better education last night, his fiscal 1988 budget proposed cutting the Education Department's funding by more than $5 billion.    The speech, and a more-detailed legislative message that accompanied it, endorsed a report he commissioned last year on how to overhaul the welfare system, which the president referred to as a &quot;monster.&quot; Although details of a proposed legislative package have yet to be sent to Congress, the president indicated he favored state-sponsored demonstration projects rather than a complete revamping of the entire system.    Similarly, the president renewed his commitment, announced in last year's address, to finding ways to help provide catastrophic health care so that people don't have to make what he called &quot;an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death.&quot; But Mr. Reagan stopped short of endorsing a plan proposed by Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen that would increase Medicare premiums to cover the cost of catastrophic health care insurance.    The president did say that the catastrophic-illness legislation he sent to Congress would be voluntary and wouldn't have &quot;the explosive potential of program expansion.&quot; Some administration officials have complained that Dr. Bowen's plan, although financed by premiums paid by recipients, eventually could become a major federal expenditure.    The administration missed its self-imposed deadline of coming up with a specific plan before the speech, but the president, who has been slowed by his recuperation from prostate surgery and the preoccupation with the Iran-Contra affair, promised one soon.    Under the heading of competitiveness, the president pushed for more money for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and less for farm-crop loans, as spelled out in his legislative material for Congress. He asked Congress to approve the Treasury's proposal to add as much as $25 billion over five years to the FSLIC, and also to revise banking laws so that U.S. institutions can better compete with foreign concerns.    The 54-year-old &quot;protectionist&quot; separation of commercial and investment banking, he said, &quot;will not work.&quot; At the same time, the president proposed further cuts in crop loans to U.S. farmers, although he didn't specify how big the cuts should be.    The president also pushed deregulation of the transportation and natural gas industries as well as revised antitrust laws -- proposals the administration has been seeking for years. The major new element in the package was a proposal for a bill to stiffen U.S. trade laws.    The president said he would work to establish university-based &quot;science and technology centers,&quot; and take a number of other steps designed to improve industry access to government-developed technology. And he called for new legislation to protect &quot;intellectual property,&quot; such as patents and trademarks.    Among other things, the intellectual-property proposal would require manufacturers of digital audio tape recorders, which are high-quality recorders made principally in Japan, to adopt technology that would prevent them from being used to reproduce copyrighted material.    The legislative message called for &quot;legal and regulatory stability&quot; in the tax credit given to companies that increase their investments in research and development. But a senior official said the administration isn't proposing any changes in the 1986 tax law, which proposes eliminating that credit after 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
