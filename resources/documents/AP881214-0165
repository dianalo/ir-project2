The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Tuesday reversed anearlier decision that barred lawsuits against the city over itsairport operations.   The ruling could prompt a flood of litigation in county courtsover airport noise or other nuisances, said Joseph Karaganis, theattorney who filed the lawsuit.   Karaganis, who called the decision a landmark in the decades-oldfight over O'Hare's impact, estimated 210,000 residents in 20 cityand suburban neighborhoods could sue Chicago under the ruling.   ``The old ruling was used by the City of Chicago to beat thesuburbs,'' Karaganis said. ``Now the door to the court is open.''   The lawsuit was filed for Lawrence C. Bieneman of Bensenville,who seeks damages exceeding ``tens of thousands of dollars'' forproperty damage and personal injury from O'Hare noise and airpollution, Karaganis said. The case now goes to DuPage CountyCircuit Court and may be consolidated with similar lawsuits.   ``Perhaps it will give us an opportunity to negotiate outside thecourts ... and get Chicago to mitigate some of these concerns,''said Geils, who serves on the O'Hare Advisory Board.   City Corporation Counsel Judson Miner had not read the decision,but said, ``I don't view it as a loss.''   ``Studying the ramifications will take some time, so I don't knowif it opens any doors or not,'' he said.   Since 1975, the 7th Circuit had barred lawsuits seeking tocollect damages from the city, which owns O'Hare, for complaintsresulting from airport operations. It said management of an airportwas a federally regulated activity, which pre-empted state law.   Other federal courts disagreed.   ``We must decide whether to maintain a go-it-alone position,''appellate Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote in Tuesday's ruling.   He said the court was convinced that its 1975 ruling was wrongand that ``we should 'fess up to the error.''   Geils said the impact of the jet-traffic racket on schoolchildren``has been very significant ... there is constant distraction,constant interruption of the learning process.''   Past noise-abatement efforts have been financed by the federalAirport Improvement Program trust fund overseen by the FederalAviation Administration, he said, and more funds are being soughtfor the 12 remaining schools of 27 targeted for soundproofing inseveral suburban communities.   Bieneman said Wednesday his O'Hare-related problems began in 1970.   He cited windows and walls cracked by vibrational stress from thejet noise, landing lights that shine into one south-facing bedroomand turn night into day, and other problems.   ``Why should I move? I've been here since 1949 ... it's where mykids were raised,'' said Bieneman.</TEXT></DOC>
