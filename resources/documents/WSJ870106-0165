BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP LABORTRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   France's continuing rail strike, coupled with sporadic labor troubles in other public services, could help determine Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's political future.    If Mr. Chirac faces down the striking train engineers, some politicians and political analysts say, he will cement his leadership of the conservative coalition that governs France. He will become the main challenger to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in next year's scheduled presidential elections. But if he backs down, he will reinforce the impression he sometimes gives as a man who talks a tough game but hesitates in crises.    The election is scheduled for 15 months from now and, of course, much could change before then. But over the years, many political insiders have criticized Mr. Chirac for wavering when he has to make tough decisions. A fresh setback, coming after he backed down on education reform last month in the face of student protest, would cast more doubt on his presidential qualifications.    &quot;This strike in a sense is his last chance,&quot; says Philippe Moreau Defarges of the French Institute of Political Studies. &quot;If he gives in, he loses all chance of becoming president of the republic. If he holds on, he will retain that hope.&quot;    The problem isn't simple. The strike began as a wildcat stoppage on Dec. 18. Most unions, initially caught off guard, hurried to back the walkout, which spread throughout the country. The Communist-dominated General Labor Confederation, or CGT in its French initials, is attempting to spread the strike into other public service areas. It has called an electricity production strike for today, when a strike by Paris subway and bus workers also has been called by several unions. France's employers' federation warned yesterday that the rail strike already is causing serious problems in such sectors as steel, textiles and paper.    Mr. Chirac's advisers acknowledge that if the strike continues he would have to tough it out, even if the economy suffers. If the rail unions win concessions, the aides say, every other public service union would demand them.    Meanwhile, Mr. Chirac is being sniped at not only from the Socialist and Communist opposition, but also from within his own ruling coalition. The most outspoken critic is former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who retains presidential ambitions. He said this weekend that the government had committed &quot;errors of method and timing&quot; by imposing economic reforms without giving workers time to digest them.    Former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, another presidential hopeful, has staked his future on opposing the political &quot;cohabitation&quot; between Mr. Chirac and a Socialist president. Mr. Barre is scheduled to be interviewed on television this week and is likely to criticize Mr. Chirac.    President Mitterrand also has seized the occasion. On New Year's Day he invited striking rail workers to the country retreat where he was spending the holiday. In reaction, Mr. Chirac made a veiled criticism of Mr. Mitterrand, saying in a New Year's message that all &quot;authorities of the state&quot; should have a &quot;clear understanding of their duty.&quot; He added, &quot;Don't expect the government to carry out a policy that would . . . relaunch inflation {and} put our competitiveness into question.&quot;    Some experts think Mr. Chirac may yet win the face-off with the unions and with his political rivals. Yesterday, in his first public statement on the strike, Mr. Chirac ruled out any pay-raise concessions that would endanger his anti-inflation policy. &quot;Loss of control over wages&quot; in the case of the trainmen would &quot;spread to the whole of the public sector and the private sector,&quot; he said.    Railway management, meanwhile, says workers are returning to work slowly. Management says only 70% of on-train workers are striking, compared with 90% at the strike's high point. The company says train service, which had fallen to 20% of normal, was back to 40% Sunday and 50% yesterday. Workers disputed the figures.    Serge July, editor of the influential left-wing daily, Liberation, wrote yesterday that the episode could turn into a success analogous to President Reagan's facing down the air traffic controllers and Margaret Thatcher's defeat of the striking miners.    &quot;For Mr. Chirac's generals, the rail strike has become the battlefield on which the government thinks it can reverse a destructive series of retreats, defeats and humiliations,&quot; Mr. July said. </TEXT></DOC>
