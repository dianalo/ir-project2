The first uses a reformulation of the saddle point systemand reduces the derivation of domain decomposition algorithms for Stokesto the definition of domain decomposition preconditioners for secondorder problems. The second applies domain decomposition directly to Stokesand gives rise to a saddle point system for the velocity nodes on thesubdomain boundaries and the mean values of the pressure on the subdomains.This system is solved iteatively.</TEXT></DOC>
