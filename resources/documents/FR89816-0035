The March 27 documentdealt with the establishment of hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor migratory game birds under andSection; 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109and 20.110 of subpart K. On June 6, 1989, the Service published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 24290) a second document consisting ofa supplemental proposed rulemaking dealing with both the early- and late-seasonframeworks. On July 13, 1989, the Service published for public commentin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 29640) a third document consisting ofa proposed rulemaking dealing specifically with frameworks for early-seasonmigratory bird hunting regulations. On August 11, 1989, the Service publisheda fourth document (54 FR 32975) containing final frameworks for early migratorybird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officialsfrom the States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands selected early-seasonhunting dates, hours, areas and limits for 1989-90. This document is thefifth in the series and deals specifically with proposed frameworks forthe 1989-90 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. Before September1, 1989, the Service intends to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a sixth document consisting of a final rule amendingsubpart K of 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor mourning, white-winged and white-tipped doves; band-tailed pigeons;rails; moorhens and gallinules; woodcock; common snipe; sea ducks in certaindefined areas of the Atlantic Flyway; September teal; experimental Septemberduck seasons in identified States; experimental and special September Canadagoose seasons in portions of identified States; sandhill cranes in theCentral and Pacific Flyways; doves in Hawaii; migratory game birds in Alaska,Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; and some extended falconry seasons.This fifth document specifically deals with late-season regulations. Lateseasons generally commence about or after October 1 and include most waterfowlseasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of the Duck Situation</ITAG>The decade of the 1980's has been hard on ducks and their habitat acrosslarge areas of North America. During this decade, 4 of the 6 lowest Maypond counts were recorded in Prairie Canada. Continued widespread droughtand agricultural impacts on wetland in Canada and the north-central UnitedStates led to record low duck breeding populations. These agriculturalimpacts on marshes and surrounding habitats accelerated because of thedrought and seriously reduced the capability of traditional prairie habitatsto produce ducks. Many areas once important to breeding ducks have beenpermanently affected.During 1988, the drought intensified and habitat destruction continued.The problem is not one of a single year of severe drought. Some importantbreeding areas have been extremely dry since 1980. Though some areas receivedabove or near normal precipitation in 1989, much of the additional precipitationonly replenished soil-moisture so there was little runoff and no improvementin pond numbers. However, increased soil-moisture did promote a significantimprovement in vegetative growth. Several years of good climatic conditionswill be required before many drought stricken areas recover.Breeding population estimates were 8 percent below the 1988 level and 24percent below the long-term average. Nine of the 10 indicator species decreasedduring the last year; pintails, bluewings, and scaup are at record lows;and mallards are 25 percent below their long-term average. However, thedecline in the breeding population appears to have been somewhat offsetby increases in late nesting indices and, in some areas, improvements inproduction. The result is a fall flight index of ducks slightly lower thanlast year.Although hunting is not the cause of the decline in duck numbers, it isone influence that we can regulate. Restrictive hunting regulations during1985-87, in combination with low number of ducks, reduced the harvest by25 percent, in comparison to that of the 1980-84 period, with nearly equalreduction in each of the four flyways. Harvest rates on mallards were reducedsignificantly for all sex and age classes. Regulations were further restrictedduring the 1988-89 hunting season and reduced the harvest by an additional50 percent. Restrictive regulations have been in effect since 1985. Survivalrates have increased in recent years for all sex and age cohorts of mallards.Sacrificing some hunting opportunity may protect duck populations at lowlevels.In consideration of multiple years of drought conditions and the slow recoveryexpected for habitat and duck populations, maintenance of basic breedingpopulations is a primary objective. High harvest rates on populations withpoor recruitment are not in the interest of the resource or the futureof waterfowl hunting. Further, the Service believes that the drought impactswill persist for some time and that recovery will require several yearsof good climatic conditions. For these reasons, the Service is proposinghunting season frameworks similar to those of 1988-89 to maintain duckbreeding stocks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Comments Received at Public Hearing </ITAG>Sixteen statements were offered at the August 3, 1989, public hearing.Portions of some of these statements were related to matters outside thepurpose of the hearing. Each statement is summarized below and was consideredin the development of these proposed late-seasons frameworks. Responsesto the public hearing comments are deferred and will be incorporated intoresponses to written comments received in reply to this document and publishedwith the final frameworks for late seasons. Doug Inkley, representing the National Wildlife Federation, described theimportance of wetlands to waterfowl as well as to numerous other wildlifespecies and to social needs. He urged the Service to redouble its effortsto protect wetlands. He believed it would be appropriate to continue theconservative regulations implemented in 1988-89 and made the followingspecific regulatory recommendations: (1) Continue the nationwide closureon canvasbacks that was in place last year, noting the canvasback populationrose only slightly since last year; (2) maintain restricted framework dates,with a closing date of January 7 for ducks in all flyways to minimize theharvest on adult ducks and those with a high probability of breeding; (3)implement a nationwide closure on pintails in view of the new record lowlevel of breeding pintails and the very low age ratio observed last yearin the harvest, noting that the pintail regulations allowed last year,which were more liberal in the Pacific Flyway, cannot be justified; (4)cautiously supported a return to shooting hours of one-half hour beforesunrise to sunset, suggesting there is no evidence that opening hours havea significant impact on total harvest; (5) continue the closed season oncackling Canada geese and Pacific brant in the Pacific Flyway until thesepopulations have recovered to population objectives; and (6) continuationof a conservative expansion of tundra swan hunting in the Atlantic Flyway,noting the expansion of tundra swan hunts to several additional Statesin that flyway in 1988 was successful and swan populations remain stable.Mr. Gary Myers, representing The Wildlife Society, reviewed the 1988 waterfowlstatus, regulations and harvests. He supported conservative duck regulationsagain in 1989 to protect breeding stocks, liberalized regulations for goosepopulations whose status is improved in 1989, and continuation of huntingopportunity on swans. He stated that a combination of regulations, enforcement,and habitat improvement will be necessary to achieve the population objectivesof the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Mr. Charles Potter, representing the North American Wildlife Foundation,expressed concern that the stated harvest objectives cannot be achievedwith the regulations being considered, and he does not believe that reopeningof a canvasback season can be justified. He suggested that hunting pressureshould be reduced if at all possible, and quoted former noted waterfowlbiologist Al Hochbaum as saying the management agencies should be the protectorof the resource and not the provider. Mr. Potter noted that, despite asignificant increase in the number of ponds in southern Alberta this spring,the number of breeding ducks were significantly lower, indicating thata return of better water conditions will not, alone, restore duck populations.He predicted that a return to shooting hours of one-half hour before sunriseto sunset would insure an increased duck kill, increased identificationproblems, a greater kill of hens and more crippled ducks, and would confusehunters. He noted that the Manitoba Farmers Union, traditionally opposedto having more ducks, voted this year to close the duck season out of concernabout low populations. He indicated that the voluntary restrain programwould be in full force this year and that he would encourage hunters tobuy State and Federal licenses and duck stamps to help habitat programs.He believed we should not allow duck breeding populations to fall any lower.Mr. Frank Anderson, representing the Concerned Coastal Sportsmen's Association,Mr. John Sawyer, representing the Western Massachusetts Duck Hunters Association,Mr. Jerry Woodmansee, representing the Andover Sportsman's Club, Inc.,and Mr. Jim Yoos, representing the New Jersey Waterfowl Association, expressedsupport for restoring one-half hour before sunrise shooting hours, an increasein season length to 40 days, continuation of the zone concept, and a bonusbag of 2 green-winged teal for 9-consecutive days during the regular duckseason. In general, they argued that the Atlantic Flyway has not receivedproper consideration since populations breeding in the northeastern Statesand in eastern Canada have not declined and are more productive than westernpopulations which have been severely affected by drought. They maintainthat more liberal harvest regulations are justified by reports and by commonknowledge about the derivation of duck harvests. Messrs. Anderson, Sawyer,and Woodmansee requested additional hunting days in compensation for dayslost due to State prohibitions against Sunday hunting, asked that specialconsideration be given to the growing numbers of nuisance Canada geesein Massachusetts by offering a 90-day goose season statewide. They suggestedthat the Service consider a special, experimental 50-day season on red-breastedand common mergansers to reduce impacts on fisheries programs in the northeastUnited States. Mr. Yoos cited improved winter populations indices and betterage ratios in the harvest of Atlantic Flyway ducks as evidence that theseducks did not warrant similar protection being directed towards those frommore western areas and expressed concern for loss of duck stamp revenuesto support habitat programs.Mr. Bert Jones, representing the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission,urged the reinstatement of one-half hour before sunrise to sunset shootinghours, stating that much of the 1988 decline in duck stamp sales in Louisianawas attributed to the sunrise opening of shooting hours. He requested thata 3-day September teal season be offered in 1990, citing the benefits ofincentives for habitat preservation and stating that low band recoveryrates indicate that hunting is not the cause of the decline in blue-wingedteal. He applauded the Service for not further reducing hunting opportunity,in 1989. Mr. Randy Wheeler, representing the Wetlands Habitat Alliance of Texas,asserted that maintaining the same restrictive regulations as those of1988 would be deterimental to duck populations. He encouraged reinstatementof the point system with changes that would provide an incentive to huntersto direct their harvest toward more abundant species. He noted that tealare active during the pre-sunrise period and that teal populations areless stressed than other species. He described an outbreak of avian chloreain the upper coast of Texas in December of 1988 that he believed wouldnot have occurred if there had been a September teal season last year.Such a season would have provided an incentive to landowners and othersto flood habitat early in the fall, thus providing more habitat for waterfowl.He recommended reinstatement of (1) the point system, (2) shooting hoursto one-half hour before sunrise, and (3) the September teal season. Mr. Mike Berger, representing Ducks Unlimited, Inc., presented commenton this spring's habitat conditions, lower duck breeding populations andexpected low production, and concluded that several years of good waterand good recruitment are needed to bring about a full recovery in duckpopulations. He urged private organizations and public agencies to coordinatemanagement efforts through the North American Waterfowl Management Plan.He stated that duck hunters are willing to take a conservative approachto harvest but that harvest regulations should be based on sound biologyand may differ in each flyway. He felt decisions should not be based onpolitics as they were last year. Mr. George Reiger, an editor for Field andamp; Stream magazine, expressedstrong concern about the status of ducks and the relatively poor data baseon which regulations are set. He suggested that we should err on the sideof caution in setting regulations. He made a specific recommendation fora bag limit of 2 ducks daily, a 20-day season (except 25 days in Statesthat prohibit Sunday hunting), and that shooting hours of one-half hourbefore sunrise to sunset be restored if the season and bag limit recommendedabove are implemented. He believed that, with this set of regulations,hunter satisfaction would increase and total duck harvest would be reduced.He expressed strong dissatisfaction with restoration of the point system,describing his experiences in many States during which provisions of thepoint system were never honored, even by enforcement agents and other publicservants. He believed that reordering under the point system is a preludeto an extra duck in the bag, noting that he was once an avid supporterof the point system until he observed most hunters disregarding the rules.He recommended against reopening of a canvasback season due to ambiguitiesin the population data and he urged the Service to encourage Mexico andCanada to close their seasons on canvasbacks as well. He noted a need toliberalize the season on mergansers along the east coast to reduce problemsof predation on fish. He urged caution about using more liberalized gooseregulations to offset restrictions on ducks, citing the lower breedingpotential of geese. He believed that high limits on birds degrade the birdsand suggested that geese should be promoted as trophy birds with lowerbag limits. Mr. Leon Kirkland, representing the Atlantic Flyway Council, argued thatthe majority of ducks harvested in the Atlantic Flyway originate from areaswhere populations are stable and have better age-ratios. Also, he statedthat many ducks species were above the most recent 10-year average in themid-winter survey. Based on this information he maintained that easternducks are in better shape than western populations and that regulationsare more restrictive than necessary in the Atlantic Flyway. He asked torestore shooting hours to one-half hour before sunrise, increase seasonsto 40 days, continue liberal October bag limits on wood ducks, add a bonusof 2 green-winged teal for 9 days and strongly urged the Service to gathermore data on eastern waterfowl. Mr. John M. Anderson, speaking on behalf of the National Audubon Society,urged maintaining all of the restrictions that were in effect during 1988.He said that the one-half hour before sunrise should not be reinstateduntil it can be shown to have no adverse impact on the harvest of hen mallardsand black ducks. He opposed the use of the point system option becausethe prohibition against reordering was impossible to enforce. He supportedcontinuation of those regulations for swans and geese that had been usedin 1988. He said that consideration should be given to controlling feralmute swans which detrimentally compete with native swans and with ducks.Mr. John Grandy, representing the Humane Society of the United States,supported the closed season on harlequin duck throughout the Atlantic Flyway,commended the Service on the mangitude of harvest reductions in the 1988season, but was opposed to maintaining the same regulations as last yearbecause they would not be sufficiently restrictive to meet either the needsof waterfowl or the Service's legislated responsibilities. He proposedthat shooting time begin one-half hour after sunrise because of regulationsrequiring hunters to identify certain ducks before shooting and that mergansersand coots be included in the duck limits in all flyways. He endorsed continuationof a nationwide closed season on canvasbacks and supported a nationwideclosed season on pintails. Observing that black duck populations continueto be low, he said it was the Service's duty to not maintain regulationsthat keep these populations  at such low levels. He recommended that duckseasons should be closed in the lower 48 States this season. He was distressedby requests for liberalized seasons but pleased by attitudes of those supportingfurther restrictions. He rhetorically asked were regulations driven byrestoration of populations or the opening of hunting seasons. Mr. Jim Phillips, writer and duck hunter, described declines in certainduck populations and believed that current waterfowl management would notallow recovery of those populations. He proposed: A 21-day season; one-halfhour before sunrise to sunset shooting hours; and a ``3, 2, 1'' limit,where only 3 ducks could be taken, but no more than 2 of any species, exceptonly 1 hen mallard, or 1 black duck or 1 redhead, and the season wouldbe closed on canvasbacks and pintails.Mr. John H. Vizer, III, representing the Berry B. Brooks Foundation, statedthat in a survey of hunters in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, mostrespondents favored a complete closure of duck hunting. He indicated sucha closure may not be generally accepted and he urged that the 1988 restrictiveregulations be maintained in 1989. He stated that if we err, it shouldbe done on the side of conservation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Written Comments Received </ITAG>The preliminary proposed rulemaking which appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 27, 1989, (54 FR 12534), opened thepublic comment period for late-season migratory game bird hunting regulations.As of August 3, 1989, the Service had received 186 comments, 163 of thesespecifically addressed late-season related issues. Several of these werepreviously addressed in the supplemental proposed rulemaking which appearedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated June 6, 1989, (54 FR 24290). These late-seasoncomments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the March27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Only the numbered items pertaining to late-seasonwritten comments are included. 1. Shooting Hours The Service received 145 comments, of which 139 were judged to relate tolate-season shooting hours. Of this group of 139,134 were opposed to restrictiveshootings and include: The Atlantic, Central and Pacific Flyway Councils;the Lower Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council;the State wildlife agencies of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, and South Carolina; theCalifornia Fish and Game Commission; the North Dakota Tourism Promotion;the Texas Agricultural Extension Service; Ducks Unlimited; the LouisianaWildlife Federation; the Alaska, California, and South Carolina WaterfowlAssociations; the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas; 5 local organizations;1 member of Congress from Texas; and 108 individuals. In addition, 4 ofthe comments from individuals contained a total of 195 signatures opposingrestrictive shooting hours. Some of the arguments against the proposedregulations included: <ITAG tagnum="16">a. Shooting hours are basic regulations which dictate the time tohunt and should not be used to regulate harvest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">b. The change to sunrise shooting complicates regulations and willlikely increase violations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">c. Sunrise shooting will shift the harvest away from species suchas wood ducks to other species of concern, i.e., mallards and pintails.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">d. The pre-sunrise period is an aesthetic and traditional part ofwaterfowling. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">e. Sunrise shooting will erode hunter participation and decrease fundsfor habitat acquisition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">f. Shooting hours were unnecessary to achieve desired reductions inharvest.</ITAG>The State of Wisconsin and 3 individuals supported restrictive shootinghours. A hunting club from Texas supported restrictive shooting hours butexpressed mixed emotion since they believe it reduces teal harvest. Theyrecommend, as an alternative, shooting hours beginning at 15 minutes beforesunrise. Several commenters recommended alternatives involving shootinghours that end earlier than sunset. The Service is proposing shooting hoursthat begin at one-half hour before sunrise and end at sunset for all migratorygame birds unless other restricted. 2. Frameworks for Ducks in the Conterminous United States_Outside Dates,Season Length, and Bag Limits a. Harvest strategy_Many of the comment received that oppose restrictiveshooting hours stated that other restrictions, such as season length andbag limits, would be preferable. These comments are considered to be relatedto shooting hours and not related to a desire to restrict other frameworks,and are, therefore, summarized under item 1. <T3>Shooting Hours. </T3>b. Framework dates_The States of Missouri and Wisconsin supported the restrictiveframework dates set in 1988-89. An individual from Texas and one from Virginiasuggested delaying the opening and closing framework dates. The CentralFlyway Council and the State of Colorado recommended floating frameworkdates opening on the Saturday nearest October 1 and closing on the Sundaynearest January 20. The Service is proposing to set the annual frameworkdates for 1989-90 to open on October 7 and close on January 7. c. Season length_The State of New York, the New York State ConservationCouncil, the California Waterfowl Association, and local organization,and 3 individuals were opposed to the restrictive season length. The Statesof Missouri and Wisconsin supported this restriction. One individual fromIdaho suggested a further restriction in season length. The Service isproposing to continue with the same season lengths as were in effect in1988-89. d. Closed seasons_Four individuals suggested a temporary closed seasonif it were needed to protect breeding stocks of ducks in 1989-90. The Servicetook this view into consideration, but is proposing to allow duck hunting,with restrictive regulations, in 1989-90. e. Bag limits_(i) The State of Wisconsin supported restrictive bag limitsand, if needed, further restrictions in the bag limit. Two individualssuggested further decreasing the bag limit. The States of Colorado, Minnesotaand Missouri, and 3 individuals also supported restrictive bag limits.The State of California and 8 individuals from Texas suggested increasedbag limits for certain species only; while the State of New York, the CaliforniaWaterfowl Association, 3 local organizations, and 3 individuals suggestedincreasing the bag limit for all ducks. The Service is proposing similarbag limits to those in effect during the 1988-89 season.ii. One member of Congress from Texas, 3 flyway councils, 5 State agencies,3 local organizations, and 60 individuals commented on the point systemof bag limits. The Congressman from Texas, on behalf of his constituents,favored a return to the point system to redirect hunting pressure awayfrom species of greatest concern. The Central and Pacific Flyway Councilsrecommended that the point system option be reinstated as a way of directingharvest toward more abundant species and away from those needing more protection.The Atlantic Flyway Council made no specific recommendation but indicatedit is reviewing information on the point system. The State wildlife agenciesof Colorado, Missouri and Oklahoma, and the Texas Agricultural ExtensionService all recommended that the point system option be reinstated. Theycited the greater ability of that system over the conventional bag limitin reducing harvest on species of greatest concern, such as mallards andpintails, while redirecting harvest toward species such as green-wingedteal which exhibit better status. The Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Managementrecommended that, with continuing low populations of ducks, the stronglyconservative frameworks initiated in 1988 be maintained. Three local organizationsfrom Texas commented on the point system, with one recommending againstits reinstatement due to the ``reordering'' problem and the other two recommendingthat it be reinstated, indicating that the conventional bag limit placesmore pressure on species of greatest concern. Fifty-eight individuals,all from Texas, recommended that the point system be reinstated, generallyciting the reasons as did agencies noted above. One individual recommendedagainst reinstatement of the point system and one described how the systemis more conservative but did not make a specific recommendation. The Serviceis proposing to allow the point system option in the Mississippi and CentralFlyways for 1989-90. Point values that are no more liberal than the conventionalbag limit have been proposed.3. American Black DucksA representative from the New York State Conservation Council supportedcontinuation of the one black duck bag limit.4. Wood DucksNine individuals from Texas recommended that the bag limit on wood ducksin that State be liberalized, with some specifying a change to allow 3instead of 2 wood ducks in the bag. The rationale for making the requestwas that wood ducks in east Texas appear to be very abundant. The Serviceis proposing to suspend the liberal October wood duck option.7. Extra Teal OptionBoth the Central and Pacific Flyway Councils reviewed the issue of bonusteal and other bonus ducks in the bag limit and both recommended that optionsfor bonus ducks, including teal, be offered when the status of the speciesinvolved warrant additional harvests. The New York Division of Fish andWildlife supported bonus teal options, indicating that the State was unfairlyrestricted in 1988 when bonus ducks were suspended. The South CarolinaWildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division recommended that bonus green-wingedteal be reinstated in the bag limit, citing the relatively healthy statusof this species and the need to take advantage of these species by providingadditional hunting opportunity on those species when the status of otherspecies is poor. The Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management recommendedagainst allowing bonus teal, citing the poor status of duck populationsin general. Two conservation organizations recommended that bonus tealoptions be reinstated in the Atlantic Flyway. Eight individuals, all butone from Texas, made general recommendations for more liberal limits onteal.9. Special Scaup SeasonThe State of Wisconsin supported the suspension of the special scaup season.An organization from New York requested reinstatement of the special scaupseason for New York.10. Extra Scaup OptionThe New York Division of Fish and Wildlife, the New York State ConservationCouncil, one local organization and one individual from New York requestedreinstatement of the bonus bag limit on scaup. The Wisconsin Bureau ofWildlife Management supported the suspension for bonus scaup.11. MergansersThe Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management recommended that regulationsfor mergansers be the same as last year. The Minnesota Department of NaturalResources supported separate bag limits for mergansers in the conventionaloption for the regular duck season.12. Canvasback and Redhead DucksThe Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management supported continuation of seasonsand limits on redheads and the closed season on canvasback as occurredlast year. A regional representative for the New York State ConservationCouncil proposed a daily bag limit that would include one canvasback becausethat species was numerous in his region.13. Duck ZonesThe Pacific Flyway Council provided an elevation of the effects of zoningand split seasons on harvest and recommended on April 4, 1989, to continueusing existing zones and to continue a moratorium on new zones; however,on July 28, 1989, the Council rescinded its earlier recommendation fora moratorium and proposed as an option for States to establish one newzone. The Central Flyway Council recommended that zoning be an option availableto all States as long as certain evaluation criteria were met. The WisconsinBureau of Wildlife Management concurred that the use of zones and splitsshould be reviewed and their continued use be reconsidered if populationsdo not show significant improvements. Either unqualified support for continueduse of existing zones or opposition to any suspensions of their use wasgiven by the New York Division of Fish and Wildlife, three local organizations,and a regional representative for the New York State Conservation Council.Idaho Fish and Game requested that the State be zoned into two large zonesbecause of markedly different altitudinal and climatic conditions affectingavailability of birds and opportunities for hunters. Support for the Idahozones was given by the Pacific Flyway Council, and an Idaho hunter (allegedlyrepresenting 5,000 waterfowlers in Idaho). A Texas hunter recommended thatTexas be allowed to create a third, new zone for that State.The Pacific Flyway Council provided an evaluation of the effects of zoningand split seasons on harvest and recommended retention of the option tosplit seasons into two segments. The Central Flyway Council and the SouthernRegion Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendedthat States be allowed to split their regular season into three segmentsin lieu of zoning. The Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management concurredthat the use of zones and splits should be reviewed and their continueduse be reconsidered if populations do not show significant improvements.Either unqualified support for continued use of split seasons or oppositionto any suspension of its usage was given by the New York Division of Fishand Wildlife, one local organization, and a regional representative forthe New York State Conservation Council. One hunter recommended a multipleseason of Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday hunting but with fewer overalldays of potential hunting.14. Frameworks for Geese and Brant in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length and Bag Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">Atlantic Flyway</ITAG>One individual from New York supported the 90-day Canada goose season,one individual from Virginia supported the 2 Canada geese per day limit,and one local organization from Massachusetts suggested increasing theCanada goose season length from 70 to 90 days statewide. The PennsylvaniaGame Commission recommended a bag increase from 2 to 3 Canada geese in4 Pennsylvania counties. The Atlantic Flyway Council did not approve Pennsylvania'srecommendation.The Atlantic Flyway Council rescinded its recommendation for an increasein the Atlantic brant bag limit but continued to recommend an increasein the greater snow goose bag limit, an expansion of the special Delawarearea, and establishment of a special late-season in Georgia.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mississippi Flyway</ITAG>The Upper Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Counciland the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources endorsed a change inthe boundary of Iowa's Southwest Goose Zone. The Upper Region RegulationsCommittee also endorsed a request from the Indiana Department of NaturalResources to split its goose season within existing zones into 3 segments.The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission requested that the State be permittedto have a Canada goose season again in 1989-90. The Wisconsin Departmentof Natural Resources supported recommendations from the Mississippi FlywayCouncil for increased harvest of Mississippi Valley Population Canada geesein 1989. One individual supported more liberal bag limits for geese.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pacific Flyway</ITAG>One individual from California requested a 21-day season with a bag limitincrease from 1 to 2 white-fronted geese for the Kamath Basin. The PacificFlyway Council and the California Fish and Game Department recommendedlifting restrictions on hunting large Canada geese in the Sacramento andSan Joaquin goose closure zones. Another individual from California questionedthe need for these restrictive areas.15. Tundra SwansThe States of Montana and Nevada offered a correction to the preliminaryproposals presented in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534). The June 6,1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 24290) presented the corrected proposals(a) that permits in the Pacific Flyway portion of Montana would be validin Teton, Cascade, Toole, Liberty, Hill, and Pondera counties; and (b)that tundra swan hunts in the Central Flyway portion of Montana would runconcurrent with the goose season. The Atlantic and Pacific Flyway Councilssupported the proposal for tundra swan hunts. The Wildlife InformationCenter, Inc., recommended a ban on the hunting of tundra swans. They believethere are negative impacts to behavior and ecology of swans as a resultof hunting and that alternative methods should be developed to reduce cropdamage. The Service is proposing swan frameworks as they existed in 1988-89.17. CootsThe Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management supported the proposed frameworksfor coots. The California Department of Fish and Game proposed that frameworksfor seasons on coots be separated from those for ducks in the Pacific Flyway.20. Common SnipeThe Wisconsin Bureau of Wildlife Management supported the proposed frameworksfor common snipe. The California Department of Fish and Game proposed thatframeworks for seasons on common snipe be separate from those for ducksin the Pacific Flyway.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Invited</ITAG>Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress andhaving due consideration for any data or views submitted by interestedparties, the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemakingwill specify open seasons, shooting hours and bag and possession limitsfor designated migratory game birds in the United States.The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests and therefore desires to obtain for considerationthe comments and suggestions of the public, other concerned governmentalagencies and private interests on these proposals. Such comments, and anyadditional information received, may lead to final regulations that differfrom these proposals.Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulationswhich limit the amount of time which the Service can allow for public comment.Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemakingprocess must operate: the need, on the one hand, to establish final rulesat a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agenciesto appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms, and,on the other hand, the unavailability before mid-June of specific, reliabledata on this year's status of some waterfowl, and migratory shore and uplandgame bird populations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow commentperiods past the dates specified earlier is contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Procedure</ITAG>It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practical,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written commentsto the Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Room 634-Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240. Commentsreceived will be available for public inspection during normal businesshours at the Service's office in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.All relevant comments on these late-season proposals received no laterthan August 28, 1989, will be considered.

Frameworks are summarized below.General<T3>Split Season: </T3>States in all Flyways may split their season forducks, geese or brant into two segments. States in the Atlantic and CentralFlyways may, in lieu of zoning, split their season for ducks or geese intothree segments. Exceptions are noted in appropriate sections.<T3>Shooting Hours: </T3>From one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily,for all species and seasons, including falconry seasons.<T3>Deferred Season Selections: </T3>States that did not select rail, woodcock,snipe, sandhill cranes, common moorhens and purple gallinules and sea duckseasons in July should do so at the time they make their waterfowl selections.Frameworks for open seasons and season lengths, bag and possession limitoptions, and other special provisions are listed below by Flyway.Atlantic FlywayThe Atlantic Flyway includes Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine,Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and WestVirginia.<ITAG tagnum="81">Ducks, Coots and Mergansers</ITAG><T3>Hunting Seasons and Duck Limits:</T3><T3>Outside Dates: </T3>Between October 7, 1989, and January 7, 1990.<T3>Hunting Season: </T3>Not more than 30 days.<T3>Canvasbacks: </T3>The season on canvasbacks is closed.<T3>Harlequin Ducks: </T3>The season on harlequin ducks is closed.<T3>Duck Limits: </T3>The daily bag limit is 3 and may include no morethan 1 hen mallard, 2 wood ducks, 2 redheads, 1 black duck, 1 mottled duck,1 pintail, and 1 fulvous tree duck.
