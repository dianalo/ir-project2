Nobuhiko Sasaki of the international trade and policy bureau said copies of the letter were sent earlier this week to 16 U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).    A similar letter will be sent later to all members of both houses of Congress, he added.    The Japanese cabinet last Friday approved an amendment aimed at tightening control of exports to communist countries after disclosures that Toshiba Machine Co. had exported computerized milling machines that the U.S. says helped the Soviet navy build quieter submarine propellers, making the submarines harder to detect.    Toshiba Machine is a unit of Toshiba Corp., Japan's second-largest electronics company. The government says its sale violated both Japanese trade laws and rules of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. Paris-based Cocom, which groups Japan and 13 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizaton, regulates exports to the Soviet Union and other communist nations. </TEXT></DOC>
