(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Data compression doubles capacity of 1/4-inch tape drivesandM;With volume deliveries of state-of-the-art, 320M-byte quarter-inch streamingtape drives still months away, some players in the industry are using datacompression to increase capacity.andP;  It's a trend that could push quarter-inchdrives above 1M byte and shake up the marketing strategies of manufacturerswith limited offerings.andM;Two vendors have already taken the leap: Colorado Memroy Systems Inc.,andO;Loveland, Colo., and Tallgrass Technologies, Overland Park, Kan.andP;  Both use anew cartridge with more tape and a software implementation of a datacompression algorithm licensed from Stac, Pasedena, Calif., to increasecapacity.andM;Colorado Memory boosted the capacity of a half-high, 5-1/4-inch, QIC-150150M-byte drive to about 500M bytes.andP;  Two versions of the company's newQFA-500 drives are available for IBM Corp.andP;  PCs, PS/2s and compatibles.andP;  Anadd-in model lists for $1,395, while a standalone units costs $1,795.andM;Tallgrass, meanwhile, offers the data-compression software as an upgrade forits TG-1140, a QIC-40 40M-byte drive aimed at PC and PS/2 markets.andP;  The drivelists for $495.andP;  With the compression software, which sells for $39.95,capacity jumps to 80M bytes.andP;  By using a longer tape, it's possible to store120M bytes on the device, according to Tallgrass.andM;Data compression offers two advantages.andP;  First, it enables manufacturers toincrease capacity without radically changing their designs.andP;  Second, acompressed data stream enhances throughput by increasing the effectivetransfer rate (see table).andP;  That means less time for backing up rigid disks,one of the main uses for tape drives.andM;As the first vendors with data-compression products, Colorado Memory andTallgrass are gambling that their approach will become the standard adoptedby Quarter Inch Cartridge Drive Standards Inc., or QIC, an industry tradeassociation.andM;In March, QIC formed a technical subcommittee to translate Stac'sdata-compression scheme into a formal working document.andP;  The subcommittee isexpected to present the working document at the next QIC meetings, scheduledMay 23-24.andM;Compression obsessionandM;The formal standard could appear within six months, says Rich Peters, amember of the QIC technical committee and marketing director at ArchiveCorp., a leading quarter-inch tape vendor based in Costa Mesa, Calif.andP;  &quot;A lotdepends on who [besides Stac] decides to make a pitch.&quot;andM;Stac has two things going for it.andP;  The company has close ties to the QICcommunity as a supplier of chips that handle error-correcting code.andP;  Also,Stac plans to put its experience in silicon design to work on datacompression.andM;Colorado Memroy and other drive manufacturers have licensed Stac's datacompression software, but what they really want are chips because silicongets the job done a lot faster.andP;  The Stac software now can compress a datastream running at 60K bytes a second down to 30K bytes a second to doublethroughput.andP;  But in the third quarter of this year, Stac plans to beginselling coprocessor chip that will eclipse that rate, says president GaryClow.andM;A silicon implementation does make a difference.andP;  The Stac 9703A will accept250K bytes a second and trim it to 125K bytes; the 9703B will compress 500Kbytes a second to 250K bytes; and the 9704 will clip 2M bytes a second to 1Mbyte.andP;  In quantities of 1,000, the chips will be priced at $30, $50, and$125, respectively.andM;How well data compression works depends as much on the scheme itself as onthe type of information being processed, says Robert Abraham of FreemanAssociates Inc., the Santa Barbara, Calif., research outfit.andM;Generally speaking, compression works by identifying patterns of similarinformation and substituting a shorter data stream for it.andP;  Spreadsheet, textand database files typically lend themsselves well to compression.andP;  What doesnot is data that is random and always changing--compiled code, for example.andM;William Beierwaltes, president of Colorado Memory, likes the Stac approachbecause it's adaptive.andP;  &quot;It samples the data for recurrences and puts thatinformation in a table.andP;  The more it occurs, the higher in the table itgoes,&quot; he says.andM;Some compression methods have to create new tables for each language, but notso with Stac, Beierwaltes contends, saying that its one table continues tobuild and handles repetition.andM;However, software-based data-compression algorithms are not for everyone,Beierwaltes notes.andP;  Because it's a CPU-intensive task, compression softwarecan actually increase the time needed to back up a disk on low-end systems.andO;Without data compression, for instance, copying 10M bytes from a disk to tapetakes about an hour; with data compression, about two hours are needed, hesays.andM;However, with PCs running Intel Corp.andP;  80286 and 80386 processors,Beierwaltes says, compression becomes more feasible.andP;  But with thecompression algorithm inside silicon, transfer rates will double.andM;The strategy at Stac, says company chief Clow, is to inject its compressiontechnology at the low end.andP;  That could cause some reverberations.andM;Manufacturers of QIC-40 drives, for example, could run capacities up to 120Mbytes through a combination of data compression and longer tape cartridges.andO;(For the past year, Carlyle Memory Products Group of San Diego has soldextended DC600-type cartridges that hold 1,000, instead of 600, feet of tapefor 5-1/4-inch streamers.)andM;Some observers say such supercharged QIC-40 drives could sell for $400-600.andO;By comparison, QIC-150 150M-byte drives list for about $1,400.andP;  QIC-320drives are expected to list for about $2,000.andP;  This kind of productleap-frogging could hurt vendors looking only at the high end.andM;&quot;QIC-150 people will have to think about data compression,&quot; says Clow.andP;  &quot;Andpeople with QIC-320 will have to rethink their strategy completely.&quot;andM;May.andP;  But it's clear that data compression won't become a household wordovernight.andP;  Even formal standards-setting bodies are wrestling with the idea.andO;ANSIhs X3B5 tape committee, for example, recently put a data-compressionproposals for half-inch tape on the back burner because it needed more work.andO;For now, QIC has its work cut out just defining a standard.andM;Should Stac win out, second sourcing for the silicon becomes a problem.andP;  SaysArchive's Peters, &quot;customers will have to decide if they want it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
