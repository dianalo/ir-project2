 Marketpotential for federal teaching and training courseware is estimated at about$1 billion.andP;  NIST plans to publish a report of the selected architecture anda first set of Federal Information Processing Standards by the middle of nextyear.andM;Federal agencies have been at the front of research and development intomultimedia applications because of a widespread need for interactivetraining.andP;  The adoption of multimedia systems throughout the government isexpected to be rapid and completed within the next few years, said NISTofficials at a recent government workshop.andM;The majority of federal workstations are expected to be multimedia systems inthe next five to 10 years.andP;  &quot;Multimedia will be the standard for thedesktop,&quot; said Lawrence Welsch, manager of NIST's office and systemsengineering group in its Systems and Software Technology Division.andM;NIST published a request for architectures in April and received responsesfrom 15 groups, including Digital Equipment Corp., Intel and the OpenSoftware Foundation, which varied significantly, Welsch said.andP;  Thoseresponses were to be studied last month to determine an initial proposal foran architecture.andM;Further documents are expected in response to the initial proposal, with afinal architecture program to be ready by March.andP;  A draft of the firstFederal Information Processing Standards is expected to be published at aboutthe same time.andP;  Guidelines for portable multimedia courseware is scheduled tobe made public in July.andP;  System testing for use in the federal government isexpected to start by April 1992.andM;High-definition televisionandM;A U.S.andP;  high-definition systems industry is taking shape and yielding signsof promise as new technologies begin to emerge and long-time industry rivalsbegin to entertain collaborative research and development plans.andM;The increased activity has many U.S.andP;  technologists anticipating a high-techrebound, restoring the nation to a more competitive position with theEuropean Community and Japan.andP;  More than a handful of U.S.andP;  executivesbelieve the United States can soon eclipse foreign competition by at leastseveral years.andM;The latest was a gathering of the nation's foremost players inhigh-definition research in Washington last month in a forum designed totrash preconceived notions and start anew in a consolidated, organizedeffort.andM;Not only was the often-at-odds group talking to each other for the firsttime, &quot;but they were listening,&quot; said Robert Powers, advisory engineer forMCI Telecommunications Corp. in Richardson, Texas.andM;About 100 scientists and broadcasters met for a two-day workshop.andP;  Thepurpose of the meeting was not to resolve any major issues, but to force thecombative players to start talking, said Powers on behalf of his role aschairman of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE)Committee on Communications and Information Policy.andP;  IEEE sponsored themeeting.andM;&quot;They're not on the same team, but they're on the same field,&quot; said Powers,adding that only a few weeks before he would not have throught such a meetingpossible.andM;Several hurdles have to be cleared before a U.S.andP;  high-definition effort canbe considered successful, with the primary issue the determination ofproduction and transmission standards.andP;  For example, &quot;We have to agree on thedefinition of open architecture,&quot; Powers said.andM;Across the Atlantic, the European Commission recently announced its plans toform a $1 billion consortium of European companies and governments to developand manufacture HDTV and transmission equipment.andP;  Funding for &quot;Eureka 2,&quot; asit will be called, is expected to take three to four years to pull together.andM;Computer securityandM;The National Research Council has proposed the formation of the InformationSecurity Foundation to promote the cause of computer security.andP;  The proposalis contained in a report issued Dec. 5 by the NRC and commissioned in 1988 bythe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).andP;  The report isintended to be used as a policy reference.andP;  Authors include leading figuresfrom academia and industry who hope to raise awareness of the importance ofcomputer and information security throughout government agencies and thecommercial sector.andM;High-speed computingandM;DARPA recently was granted $50 million from Congress to support the agency'spre-competitive, generic research in dual-use technologies.andP;  The money willallow DARPA to enter into 10 or more cooperative Randamp;D arrangements withindustry.andP;  DARPA Director Victor Reis is responsible for deciding whichprograms to target.andP;  No formal announcements have been made, but governmentsources said last week that one of the big winners is expected to behigh-speed computing.andP;  In addition, Congress recently appropriated $128million to DARPA's High Speed Computing Initiative, which was $10 millionshort of its authorization.andM;Former DARPA researcher Robert Kahn, the man regarded as the &quot;godfather&quot; ofnetworked computing, has been busy building consensus for a national systemthrough his nonprofit corporation for National Research Initiative in Reston,Va.andP;  Kahn, who created the nation's first network of computers, Arpanet, hasbeen laying the groundwork to create a supercomputer highway connectingcampuses, government and industrial laboratories nationwide.andM;Corporations such as IBM, DEC, Xerox, MCI and others are among his targetprivate sector supporters.andP;  NRI also receives funding from DARPA, theDepartment of Energy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.andP;  Moreover,NRI has been promoting the concept of a knowledge bank containing the latestscientific data.andP;  Researchers would have immediate access via theirworkstations to their colleagues' latest research.andP;  &quot;Our biggest project isthe Gigabit networking project,&quot; Kahn said.andP;  The project is with theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute ofTechnology, MCI, IBM and GTE, and aims to develop supercomputers capable ofsending information at 1 billion bits a second over fiber optic cables.andM;Japan interest in interfacesandM;A delegation from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industryrecently visited the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University ofMaryland and showed a strong interest in research that U.S.andP;  companies havelargely ignored.andM;Ben Shneiderman, director of the university lab, unveiled his touchscreentechnology, which included applications ranging from programming VCRs tocontrolling home appliances that respond with the touch of a finger to a PCscreen.andM;The Japanese are admittedly quite interested in the technology.andP;  During thelast two months, four Japanese delegations have visited the Maryland lab andmet with Shneiderman.andP;  MITI is preparing a report due out next spring thatwill forecast the state of personal computing in the year 2000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
