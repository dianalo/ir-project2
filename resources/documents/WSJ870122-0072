According to William Bushnell, chairman and chief executive officer of the bank holding company, net will decline to about $3.2 million, or 34 cents to 36 cents a share, from the year-earlier $3.9 million, or 43 cents a share, which was adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split last January. Mr. Bushnell said that without a $2.2 million one-time charge resulting from tax-law changes pertaining to the deductibility of bad-debt expense, Amoskeag would have reported a 40% earnings increase.    The tax bill &quot;in total, accrues to our benefit, by about $7 million over four years,&quot; Mr. Bushnell said. Amoskeag's tax rate will drop to 40% in 1987 and to 34% in 1988 from 46% last year and in 1985, he said.    Despite the fourth-quarter charge, and a previously reported $1.6 million one-time charge for prepaying debt to the Federal Home Loan Bank, Amoskeag expects to report that earnings for the full year rose 40% to 45%, Mr. Bushnell said. He said he expects to report that net for all of 1986 totaled $19 million to $20 million, or $2.15 to $2.20 a share. Amoskeag reported 1985 net of $13.8 million, or $1.51 a share, adjusted for a stock split.    The biggest factor in last year's earnings growth was a gain from securities transactions. On a pre-tax basis, it grew to more than $18 million from $7.1 million. Furthermore, Mr. Bushnell said, Amoskeag reinvested its funds in the stock market and has &quot;done very well this month.&quot; He also said the prepayment to the Bank Board will cut interest costs in 1987 and 1988.    Mr. Bushnell said that Amoskeag's core business is growing 25% to 30% annually, with year-end assets of $1.5 billion, up about 23% from a year earlier.    He said Amoskeag, which generally pays out 25% to 30% of net in dividends, will review its dividend in the second quarter. It raised the quarterly payment last May to 14 cents from 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
