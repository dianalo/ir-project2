Thisdecision was based on the assumption that the intention of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) is to focus on the physical environment,and the casual chain between psychological distress and adverse healtheffects is tenuous. In this paper the authors summarize the literatureon the relationship between environmentally-induced stress and its effectson health. They present the results of a new survey research projectin which levels of stress were evaluated in West Chicago, Illinois, acommunity in which radioactive wastes have been present for many years.Explanatory social variables are brought into the evaluation in whichstress is evaluated as a function of proximity to the radioactive wastesite. In addition, stress is discussed in the context of attitudes onnuclear power, environmental group participation, and knowledge aboutthe health effects associated with radioactive waste. The paper endswith a discussion of the portion of the Supreme Court decision in whichpsychological distress, community stability, cohesiveness and sense ofwell being are excluded as variables to address in EISs.</TEXT></DOC>
