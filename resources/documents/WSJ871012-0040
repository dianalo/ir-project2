Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. &quot;Economic activity is buoyant,&quot; and &quot;central bankers now are saying a show of force&quot; resulting in higher short-term interest rates &quot;will stabilize inflation expectations.&quot;    Pressure for higher rates also has mounted because of central banks' intervention in the currency markets this year to maintain stable exchange rates. Intervention totaling about $90 billion to shore up the dollar this year fueled money supply growth in Japan and West Germany while stoking inflation.    According to many analysts, the strategy by the Bank of Japan, West German central bank and Federal Reserve is to nudge rates slightly higher now in the hope that stronger medicine won't be needed later. The problem, some fear, is the Fed may be losing control over events.    Already, the credit markets in Japan, the U.S. and West Germany are responding nervously to recent credit-tightening moves. Yields on actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds surged a quarter of a percentage point last week to 9.94%, the highest level since Dec. 2, 1985. In Japan Friday, yields on 10-year government issues rose sharply to 6.08% from 5.86% the previous day. West German government bond yields surged to 6.87% from 6.75%, partly as a result of proposed tax changes.    &quot;How do you avoid one bond market putting pressure on another bond market?&quot; asks Mr. Soss. &quot;That process can take the bond markets on a wild and not very merry chase.&quot; John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., agrees. &quot;The real question is whether coordinated monetary policy becomes competitive monetary policy,&quot; he says.    Whatever the case, the U.S. bond market has additional problems. Increasingly dependent on foreign capital, it likely will struggle under the weight of the nation's huge budget and trade deficits. &quot;We are now seeing the international dimension of our debt problem&quot; in the bond market, says Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Blackstone Group, a private investment bank.    &quot;Looking at our deficits and realizing that nothing is likely to be done about them soon,&quot; foreign bond investors &quot;are demanding a huge premium for two risks: the dollar will be lower and interest rates will be higher. That's been the story the past six months. The rise in interest rates isn't a distortion. It's here to stay.&quot;    Mr. Peterson, a former commerce secretary and former chairman of Lehman Brothers, contends the U.S. deficits will plague the U.S. financial markets for years to come and cripple the nation internationally.    &quot;Foreigners don't see any presidential candidates mentioning the deficits and that is really alarming to them,&quot; says Mr. Peterson. &quot;They're saying, 'If I put my money in long-term U.S. bonds, I take a double-whammy of currency and capital depreciation.'&quot; He elaborated on these and other threats in an Atlantic magazine essay.    Some analysts say the agreement to maintain stable exchange rates among the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries is increasing pressure for higher short-term and long-term rates. Since mid-May, rates on three-month Euromark deposits climbed to about 4 7/8% from 3.56%; rates on Euroyen deposits also climbed to about 4 7/8% from 3.69%, while rates on three-month Eurodollar deposits rose to 8.75% from 7.25%, according to Merrill Lynch.    Bond investors in each of the major markets are suffering. Total returns for Japanese, U.S. and West German 10-year government issues -- minus 9.97%, minus 5.56% and minus 5.16% -- were all negative in the third quarter because price declines easily exceeded any currency appreciation or income gains, according to First Boston.    Larry Kreicher, a senior international bond analyst at Merrill Lynch, foresees little improvement in any of the major bond markets. &quot;There's a global confidence problem in the credit markets,&quot; he says.    Gilman C. Gunn, deputy head of research at London-based Banque Paribas Capital Markets, agrees: &quot;There's a bias toward higher rates everywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;Cash is king right now.&quot;    Many corporations that had hoped the recent rise in interest rates would be temporary now are convinced the bond market slump could continue for at least many months.    Despite a sharp decline in bond prices last week, Ashland Oil Inc. issued $200 million of 30-year debentures because &quot;we were concerned that rates would be a lot higher three months from now,&quot; says Charles M. Russell, administrative vice president in charge of treasury and financing for the Ashland, Ky.-based company.    &quot;In hindsight, we should have borrowed&quot; last April when Ashland filed a shelf registration for new debt with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Russell says. &quot;We paid about 100 basis points (one percentage point) over what we would have paid had we used the shelf (registration) immediately. Now, it's clear bond markets around the world are having trouble.&quot;    Some analysts fear the U.S. presidential campaign will create additional strains for borrowers and bond investors. &quot;I am very concerned about the American elections having an adverse effect on the credit markets,&quot; says David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services Inc. He says candidates will be tempted to blame Japan for America's woes, step up protectionist rhetoric, and frighten foreign investors away -- at a time the U.S. badly needs foreign capital to finance its deficits.    &quot;If some candidate who is strongly in favor of protectionism emerges as a leader, that's going to terrify foreign investors -- and it will also frighten American investors who will worry about the foreign reaction,&quot; Mr. Hale says.    In a recent speech, Mr. Hale said, &quot;The danger is that as interest rates climb higher during the opening stages of the primary season this winter, American politicians will attempt to find foreign scapegoats for the policy failures of the 1980s and promise to liberate the nation from 'financial servitude to Tokyo' through increased protectionism or even capital controls.&quot;    Whatever the case, Mr. Hale predicts that 30-year Treasury bond yields &quot;will touch 11% during the first half&quot; of next year.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   The bond market deteriorated again. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell five-eighths of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought their total losses for the week to more than two points.    The 9.94% yield on the latest 30-year Treasury issue was the high for this year and was up from 9.87% Thursday. At the beginning of this year, comparable Treasury issues were yielding only 7.5%.    Among actively traded issues, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 89 27/32 from 90 15/32 Thursday and 92 2/32 on Oct. 2. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 92 from 92 15/32 Thursday, while the yield increased to 9.91% from 9.83%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 7.13 points to close at 1153.19. That was the lowest since mid-November 1985.    Short-term interest rates also rose again. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate climbed to 6.72% bid from 6.68% Thursday, while the latest six-month bill rate rose to 7.31% bid from 7.27%.    The federal funds rate averaged 7.62% Friday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from 7.55% Thursday and an average of 7.43% in the week ended last Wednesday. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, is watched especially closely because it often provides clues to changes in Federal Reserve credit policy. </TEXT></DOC>
