The demand was part of a package of five resolutions that ask forsanctions to punish South Africa for ruling South-West Africa, alsoknown as Namibia, and a program to implement the sanctions and pressfor independence.   A procession of 71 speakers came to the podium in debate that ranfrom Monday through Thursday to castigate South Africa for occupyingSouth-West Africa in defiance of U.N. resolutions.   Not one nation voted against any of the proposals, although theUnited States, Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Australia and NewZealand abstained on some. South Africa was stripped of its votingrights in the United Nations in 1974.   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said the United Statesabstained to maintain its neutrality while mediating peace talksamong South Africa, Cuba and Angola.   South African, Cuban and Angolan negotiators tentatively agreedthis week during talks in Geneva that the Cubans will leave Angolaand South Africa will allow the United Nations to begin a one-yearindependence plan for South-West Africa.   If their governments ratify the accord, the Namibian idependenceprocess could begin early in 1989.   Cuban troops have been in Angola since 1975 to defend thatcountry's Marxist government from raids by the UNITA rebel movement_ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ and itsally, South Africa.   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 73 years since Germany lostthe former colony during World War I. The League of Nations, theUnited Nations' predecessor, subsequently granted South Africa amandate to administer Namibia.   In 1966, the United Nations revoked the mandate. In 1978, theSecurity Council passed Resolution 435, a one-year plan to set up aconstituent assembly to adopt a constitution and organize anindependent goverment.   The resolutions passed Thursday call South Africa's occupation an``act of aggression'' and demand prisoner-of-war treatment forcaptured members of the South-West African People's Organization(SWAPO), the guerrilla group fighting for independence.   SWAPO is designated in the resolutions as the ``sole andauthentic representative of the Namibian people.'' For years SWAPOhas held non-voting observer status in the United Nations.   Walters told the assembly that America objects to thatcharacterization, and said ``only free and democratic elections .. .will provide the Namibian people themselves the opportunity tochoose whom they want as their representative.''   The resolutions also call for mandantory economic sanctionsagainst South Africa, a step that Britain and the United States haveblocked before in the Security Council by using their veto power.</TEXT></DOC>
