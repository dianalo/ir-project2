The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll places him ina commanding position, with the support of 24% of Democraticvoters, far more than his closest competitor. The othercontenders cast glances toward Albany as they make theirplans. Neither they nor political analysts believe Mr. Cuomohas laid the matter to rest with his assertion that he &quot;hasno plans, nor plans to make plans,&quot; to run for president.</LP><TEXT>   A reporter leaves an hour-long conversation in Mr. Cuomo'soffice here with the belief that the New York Democrat isn'tgoing to run for president -- isn't going to visit the earlyprimary states, isn't going to deploy presidentialcommittees, isn't going to court Democratic power brokers.Yet a doubt persists, because Mr. Cuomo isn't going to closethe door, either.   &quot;Is it logical -- fair? responsible? -- to say that thereis no conceivable way I can change my mind?&quot; he asks.   Press him this way or that, joust with him, joke with him,cajole him or antagonize him, and the answer is the same, theline of questioning leaving him impatient. &quot;If I tell you,`I'm absolutely out and will not change my mind {no matter}what happens -- if all the candidates have strokes -- nomatter what, I will not run,' do you think somebody out therewill say: `Maybe he's got colon cancer, maybe he's got Mafiabackground.'&quot;   So he won't say it. Not now. Maybe not ever.   And for that reason, the three-term governor, at the edgeof the race but at the center of political speculation,continues to distort the Democratic contest, making thecontours of the race obscure, somehow leaving the impressionthat all the gladiators haven't yet entered the lists.   &quot;It's Cuomo and a bunch of boys,&quot; Edward Rollins, theRepublican strategist who ran President Reagan's re-electioncampaign in 1984, says of the Democratic field. &quot;He's theonly one with stature. He's the only one who has the debatingskills to make his case.&quot; Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster,adds: &quot;Cuomo is the big guy in the race because he alonecould start late and raise enough money, and couldcommunicate a critique on Bush that could be a rallying cryfor Democrats.&quot;   Roger Ailes, President Bush's media maestro, believes thatthe governor will eventually run. &quot;He has no place else togo,&quot; says Mr. Ailes, who says Mr. Cuomo would be a&quot;formidable&quot; candidate. &quot;He's a terrible governor, but thepress loves him. He doesn't worry about facts and he stays onthe offensive. We call him Monsignor Mario because he makesyou feel as if you're guilty of something and he's forgivingyou, although only he and God, in that order, understand.&quot;   Not that Mr. Cuomo would be a sure bet to defeat Mr. Bushor even to win his party's nomination. The Journal/NBC pollshows that if the election were held today, the presidentwould defeat Mr. Cuomo by a 2-to-1 margin. With a fullcampaign, other contenders would have the opportunity to chipaway at Mr. Cuomo's lead and to build support of their own,surpassing Mr. Cuomo's 24%. The poll shows the governor isalso the second choice of an additional 12%.   &quot;That level of support has got to be about as thin ascellophane,&quot; says Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-basedpollster. &quot;He's not going to do anything in the South againstany viable Republican -- it would be like a Russian election,with only one candidate. And he'd be a Margaret Mitchellspecial against any decent Southern Democrat: gone with thewind.&quot;   As a candidate, Mr. Cuomo would have to defend New York'seconomic position. The governor has struggled with theLegislature over budget questions. The state has thethird-worst credit rating in the nation, ahead of onlyLouisiana and Massachusetts. A First Albany Corp. analysissays that although the economy of New England and theNortheast should improve, the economy of New York will&quot;continue to slide,&quot; with the expectation that the recessionin New York will continue into the first quarter of 1992.   But Mr. Cuomo -- not a candidate -- says that if he didrun, he could make a political virtue out of the state'sproblems. &quot;Since the issue you want is domestic, New York isexactly the place to have a convention and exactly the placefrom which to run,&quot; he says.   Moreover, Mr. Cuomo points out that the most memorablepictures from the Great Depression were from New York, whosegovernor was Franklin Roosevelt, the winning candidate in the1932 election. &quot;How come it didn't kill Roosevelt?&quot; he asks.   When a reporter tells the governor he accepts his word,Mr. Cuomo interjects: &quot;If you took me at my word, youwouldn't be here. Let's be honest.&quot;   Besides the strong showing of Mr. Cuomo, the Journal/NBCNews poll holds good news for Sen. Albert Gore of Tennesseeand Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, both contemplatingpresidential campaigns, and distressing news for the Rev.Jesse Jackson, who is considering a third presidentialcampaign.   According to the poll, 14% of Democratic voters favor Mr.Gore, who ran in 1988, with a surprising 11% favoring Mr.Rockefeller, a newcomer to presidential politics. The Rev.Jesse Jackson is fading as a factor; though he also retainsthe support of 14%, more than a quarter of Democrats find himunacceptable. The poll shows the president would defeat Mr.Gore by more than the 2-to-1 margin against Mr. Cuomo.   Even so, Mr. Cuomo believes that the Democrats can defeatPresident Bush and that Democratic prospects need not bediminished by Mr. Bush's success with the Persian Gulf War.His formula is to argue that Democrats have never let thecountry down in times of crisis.   &quot;Yes,&quot; he says, &quot;we'd do what we have to do, we always do.Kennedy was no pushover, Truman dropped the Bomb, Rooseveltwon the war. That's our tradition, always has been. . . . Alot of the people who fought and died were Democrats and theywent willingly, and if we have to fight, we will.&quot;   But clearly Gov. Cuomo believes the Democratic message hasto be domestic -- and has to be addressed forthrightly.   &quot;The country is falling behind,&quot; he says. &quot;That is notsomething to be avoided. That is not something to be afraidto admit {for fear} you'll be accused of a lack ofpatriotism. Unless you admit that the country is fallingbehind economically, you will never do what you have to do.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo's prescription is to establish a new investmenttax credit for productive equipment, thereby spurring newcapital investment that will lead to long-term economicgrowth. He wants to change the way capital gains are taxed,reducing taxes on long-term capital gains and increasing taxrates on gains earned in less than a year. He'd also like toraise the research-and-development tax credit and in timeliberalize depreciation schedules.   The governor is sharply critical of the tactics the Bushcampaign used against Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis ofMassachusetts in 1988, and he believes the administration'scampaign against quotas this year is an appeal to racism. Buthe doesn't think Mr. Bush will win the public's support if heinjects such elements into his re-election campaign. &quot;Theywon't like him if he's mean,&quot; Mr. Cuomo says.   But the governor says Mr. Bush's opponent won't be MarioCuomo, and to illustrate this he shares a parable.   Forty years ago this month, the young Mario Cuomo and hisfather, wearing his white grocer's apron, paused behind thefamily store to sign a $2,000 baseball contract with thePittsburgh Pirates organization. The young man was one of thePirates' top prospects, but soon he expressed doubts toBranch Rickey Jr., saying that he didn't really expect tospend his life in baseball, that he had trouble visualizinghimself as a player.   &quot;I just don't think this is the right thing,&quot; he recallssaying. &quot;I think there is something else in life for me todo.&quot;   The parable ends, and now Mr. Cuomo is in 1991 again, not1951. &quot;People say you can win. So what?&quot; he says. &quot;Why mustyou want to be president. Why? Why is it the case that if youdon't want to, it creates suspicion?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
