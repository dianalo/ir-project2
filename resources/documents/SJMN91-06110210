Before last year, that propositionwould have seemed as unlikely as a Britain without Maggie Thatcher or a&quot;Today&quot; show without Jane Pauley.;    But Britain is still standing, the&quot;Today&quot; show is still on the air -- and Highway 101 is still one of the topnames in contemporary country music, without Paulette Carlson.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HIGHWAY 101 HITS ROAD WITH NEW SINGER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related article page 10EMusic  </MEMO><TEXT>     When the group's founding lead singer/songwriter/guitarist departed at theend of last year to pursue a solo career, she left a creative hole big enoughto drive a tour bus through. During her five-year tenure, the band amassed atrack record that could be the envy of almost every other vocal group inNashville: two Grammy nominations, back-to-back pairs of &quot;Group of the Year&quot;awards from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of CountryMusic and 10 Top-10 hits on the Billboard country singles chart.;    Ifthere's anyone who can pick up where Carlson left off, remaining members JackDaniels, Scott &quot;Cactus&quot; Moser and Curtis Stone are betting it's a bright22-year-old newcomer named Nikki Nelson. With a new album, &quot;Bing, Bang, Boom,&quot;due to be released at the end of May and a heavy touring schedule that willkeep them on the road most of the year, it won't be long before they find outif their bet paid off.;    In a phone call earlier this week from her mother'shome in Topaz Lake, Nev., during a break from an eight-week tour that willbring her to San Jose on Sunday, Nelson said the inevitable comparisons to herpredecessor haven't fazed her.;    &quot;It really hasn't been a major issue. We'veworked 40 dates so far on this tour, and it's been wonderful. If people aresurprised to see me, I haven't heard any negative comments at all. I've had alot of people tell me I don't sound anything like her, and then there are afew who say I sound just like her. So there you go. It'll be nice to get to apoint where I can just be thought of as the singer from Highway 101, not thenew singer.&quot;;    Nelson was born and raised in Topaz Lake, a mere speck of atown on the barren border where the East Sierra meets the high desert. Shebegan singing and playing guitar at age 12 in her father's group, Nikki andGoldrush. After cutting her teeth on the casino lounge circuit, she left TopazLake at 18 to seek fame and fortune in Nashville.;    &quot;It was nothing likeback home, where I was working five or six times a week,&quot; she said. &quot;It's justso hard to get a job in Nashville, because there are so many good singers intown.&quot; At first glance, Nelson's big break bears a faint resemblance to thevintage Hollywood legend of Lana Turner being discovered at Schwab's Pharmacy:She was working as a waitress at the Nashville Palace when Warner Bros. execMartha Sharp first heard her demo tape. Coincidentally, it was the same eaterywhere Sharp had discovered Randy Travis flipping burgers. Sharp passed thetape on to the members of Highway 101, and that led to an audition lastNovember.;    &quot;I tried to put that audition off because I had strep throat,but they seemed to overlook it. All along, I really didn't think I was goingto get it,&quot; she said. &quot;But within a week we all went out for dinner, and theytold me I was in.&quot;;    Thus began Nelson's lightning-fast induction into themajor leagues. In mid-December, she quit her waitressing job. One month later,on Jan. 16 (the day the gulf war broke out), she made her performance debutwith Highway 101 at the Grizzly Rose in Denver.;    &quot;The hardest thing waslearning the material. I know (the other band members) don't expect me to tryto be more than I am, but I feel a responsibility to know all the old and newsongs,&quot; she said. On the current tour, the band's set list is split evenlybetween old hits and fresh material off &quot;Bing, Bang, Boom,&quot; the group's fifthalbum. &quot;The new stuff is a little tougher, a little more country than some ofthe old hits,&quot; she said. &quot;But this shouldn't sound like a radical departure.Remember, three-fourths of the band is still there.&quot;;    When asked again ifshe feels nervous working in the shadow of Carlson, Nelson displayed adiplomatic savvy far beyond her years: &quot;One of the nicest things about workingwith absolute pros at this level is you rise to the occasion.&quot;;  Highway 101;Where: The Saddle Rack, 1310 Auzerais Ave., San Jose; When: 8 p.m. Sunday;Tickets: $10; Information: (408) 286-3393; Where: Doc Rickett's Lab, 95Prescott Ave., Monterey; When: 8 and 10:30 p.m. Monday; Tickets: $10;Information: (408) 649-4241  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID PLOTNIKOFF, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  887  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110210,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
