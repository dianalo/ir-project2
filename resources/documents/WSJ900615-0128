Mr. Brady, who recently estimated that the cost of thebailout -- excluding interest -- probably will more thandouble to over $130 billion, also said that without new cash,the bailout effort will be out of money by the end of thisyear. He didn't say how much additional funding will beneeded in the October-December quarter.</LP><TEXT>   Depressed real estate markets, higher interest rates,thrifts' losses in the junk-bond market and a tepid responsefrom potential buyers of sick thrifts all have contributed tothe higher costs, Mr. Brady said. &quot;Let's face it, and get onwith the job,&quot; he urged the committee.   But Democrats took the occasion to draw a distinctionbetween how the thrift crisis developed, for which bothparties appear culpable, and the halting progress in carryingout the massive thrift law, for which the lawmakers held theadministration responsible. Their comments were the latestDemocratic effort to capitalize on a growing problem forPresident Bush.   &quot;There's a second Sandamp;L crisis that started Aug. 9,&quot; whenthe law passed, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). &quot;Wehave heard more from the president about broccoli than wehave heard about this crisis.&quot; Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.)said: &quot;We are sitting on a volcano of public opinion on thisissue.&quot;   Members admonished the administration for its original,low cost estimates, saying that interest-rate projectionswere particularly low. They also complained that theadministration should have foreseen that there would be fewbuyers for thrifts under the new law's restrictions on theiractivities. &quot;I think the appearance to the American public isthat this is floundering,&quot; said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.),who chairs a task force on the efforts.   Originally, the administration targeted $50 billion tocover current Sandamp;L losses. Yesterday, Mr. Brady said about$28.3 billion will have been spent by June 30. At that point,the administration expects 289 insolvent thrifts to have beenliquidated or sold, but their bad investments will remain inthe hands of the government. Moreover, about 800 more thriftsare expected to require similar action.   Mr. Brady didn't specifically ask for Congress to passlegislation to raise the additional cash, saying this islikely to be determined in the current budget meetingsbetween the administration and Congress.   For its part, the administration used the hearing to callagain for a cut in the tax on capital gains, as a way tobolster the real estate market. &quot;At the margin, I think it'sthe single most important thing we can do,&quot; said Housing andUrban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who is a member of theOversight Board monitoring the thrift cleanup.   He also said that a clampdown on credit has made ittougher to sell the repossessed real estate. &quot;I have thefeeling that there is a strong impression among peopleinvolved in real estate and housing that there is a crunch inthe supply of credit,&quot; said Mr. Kemp.   Mr. Kemp also cautioned that politicizing the Sandamp;L messcould slow the progress even more. &quot;If we turn this into anissue of who and when and just exactly which party, I thinkit's going to be a serious blow to the necessity of findingsome area of cooperation,&quot; he said.   Both parties are pursuing Sandamp;L fraud legislation moreaggressively. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of theSenate Judiciary Committee, announced he will hold a hearingnext month to examine many of the proposals to crack down onfraud, and said he will introduce a comprehensive Sandamp;L fraudbill after the hearing. House Banking Committee ChairmanHenry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and the committee's rankingRepublican, Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie are also introducing abill to speed Sandamp;L-related prosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
