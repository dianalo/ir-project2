The possibilityof this phenomenon in thin-walled tubes in particular has been takeninto account in the Design Code as far as in the end of the sixties.As the operating temperature and temperature rates in the new types ofenergetical plants having liquid-metallic heat-transfer agent increase,the problem requires more general and stringent analysis. It is essentialto remember that strain accumulation is possible even at negligible mechanicalloads. And as it was shown in the reference the quasi-stationary temperaturefields with respect to the coordinate system moving along with the heatsource have extremum properties in the mentioned sense. The actual temperaturefields in some fast reactor core components under certain conditionsprove to be close to the quasi-stationary ones. This increases the probabilityof their geometry changes which may clearly endanger the serviceabilityof a structure and lead to its collapse. Some results of theoreticalanalysis in this field and corresponding experimental data are discussedin the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
