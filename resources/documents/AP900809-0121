Can't stay in one place all the time,'' ajocular Bush told reporters after leaving the Oval Office early inthe evening.   The White House announced earlier that Bush would leave for hissummer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, as planned Friday, but willtake extra staff with him because of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.   Bush, who was on his way out to dinner with wife Barbara, toldreporters, ``Life goes on.''   Barbara Bush has been staying at the summer home by herselfsince July 27. She flew to Washington for the day Thursday and willreturn to Kennebunkport with the president Friday.   ``The president will be conducting the business of thepresidency at Kennebunkport just as he does every year and everyvacation,'' press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.   That goes on ``24 hours a day, every day of the week, whereverhe is,'' the spokesman added.   But Bush is also expected to make a quick trip back to thecapital on Wednesday for a comprehensive briefing from militaryplanners on the status of the U.S. forces sent to Saudi Arabia.   Bush's oceanfront home at Walker's Point has its own helipad,sophisticated communications equipment, and is heavily protected onland by the Secret Service and at sea by Coast Guard ships hoveringoffshore.   The president has hosted world leaders during past vacations.Top advisers shuttled back and forth from Washington last August asBush readied his national drug strategy.   While the president has not announced a VIP guest list for thisvacation, Fitzwater said Bush will have full access to one of hisfavorite instruments of diplomacy, the telephone.   ``We believe that the communications system is excellent formaintaining liaison with anyone in Washington or around the worldthat the president should need to get in touch with,'' thespokesman said.   He said the White House never seriously considered cancellingthe vacation plans.   Asked if the president was not concerned about beingphotographed out boating or on the golf course while American GIsin Saudi Arabia are worried about a possible chemical weaponsattack by Iraq, Fitzwater answered, ``No.''   Bush has gone to Kennebunkport every summer of his life except1944, when he was off in the Pacific flying bomber missions for theNavy against the Japanese in World War II.   Either Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, or hisdeputy, Robert Gates, always accompanies Bush to Kennebunkport andprovides daily briefings on the latest U.S. intelligence from hotspots around the world.   ``Our forces are in Saudi Arabia on a defensive basis. They'renot involved in conflict, and there's not the need for any kind ofminute-by-minute or hour-by-hour update that might be necessary ifthey were actually involved in combat,'' said Fitzwater.   He said Bush's budget advisers also may make the trip toKennebunkport at some point to prepare for the resumption ofdeficit-reduction talks with congressional Democrats in earlySeptember.   Fitzwater said Bush ``probably'' will return to Washington nextweek for a briefing.   Bush plans to fly to Baltimore Aug. 20 to address the Veteransof Foreign Wars convention. He also plans to attend fundraisingevents for several GOP candidates in New England during hisvacation.
