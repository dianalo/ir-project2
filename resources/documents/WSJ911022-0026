The Bundesbank's warning sent fresh inflationjitters sweeping through German financial markets yesterday.Government bond yields and money market interest ratesspurted higher on fears of another increase in interestrates.   The economic institutes' annual autumn report, whichanalyzes global and German economic trends for thegovernment, says eastern Germany's economy will shrink 19.5%this year, then grow 12% in 1992. The east's expected shiftinto double-digit growth after two years of sharp declineswill help to offset softening in the west's economy, thereport says.   &quot;We're starting at a very low level in eastern Germany andturning upward,&quot; says Heiner Flassbeck, an economist at oneof the institutes -- the German Institute for EconomicResearch. &quot;But this still isn't the broad-based boom oreconomic miracle that some were hoping for.&quot; The report --which has a lot of influence among policy makers -- sayseastern Germany's upswing is still too reliant on governmenttransfers rather than productive investments. As a result,the report concludes, the expected growth may not be&quot;self-sustaining.&quot;   Despite this mixed picture, the government seized on thereport as new evidence of an eastern German turnaround. Theformer Communist East Germany's economy is a politicallysensitive issue for Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Opposition SocialDemocrats regularly seek to paint the outlook as darkly aspossible to boost their argument that the Kohl governmentbadly underestimated the costs of last year's unification ofEast and West Germany.   The government has acknowledged a misjudgment. The issuenow is just how much unity will finally cost and how long itwill take to truly integrate the two economies.   The worst-case scenarios, however, appear unlikely to berealized. As recently as last year, for example, there werepredictions that unemployment in eastern Germany would hitthree million during the current year, creating massivesocial and economic turmoil. Instead, the five institutes nowpredict a peak of 1.5 million jobless in the east, and thatnot until the middle of next year.   But it's also clear that Germany, once a model economy forEurope, isn't through the worst of it and can say it isn't ina position to shoulder more of the costs of bailing out thetroubled economies of the Third World or the Soviet Union.   The Bundesbank, for one, is worried less about politicsthan about the value of its money. Its monthly survey, whichunsettled financial markets yesterday, warns that Germany'spost-unity economics are running dangerously out of kilter.&quot;Recently, the process of economic unification has also leftits marks on price and cost developments,&quot; the Bundesbanksaid.   Enormous public-sector funding for eastern Germany,amounting to 5.5% of western Germany's gross nationalproduct, led to a series of tax increases last summer, andmore increases are planned for January 1993. The taxes haveadded to pressures that have driven Germany's inflation above4% for the first time in eight years. Also boding ill forinflation are recent wage increases averaging 7% in westernGermany.   &quot;Thus, the price climate has worsened substantially,&quot; andthe Bundesbank sought to correct this with its interest-ratedecision of mid-August, the Bundesbank said in its newreport.   Deutsche Bank AG economists said in a market analysis thatwestern German annual inflation, at 3.9% in September, couldeasily touch 5% in early 1992. The five institutes sayinflation could come close to 5% at the start of 1992 butexpect a 4% rate for the year. Such an increase could driveup German interest rates.   In eastern Germany, Deutsche Bank said, wage and rentincreases are adding momentum to the rise in the cost ofliving, which is likely to continue at a 15% annual rate nextyear.   Worrisome for the Bundesbank was a 4.2% rise in itsbroadly defined M3 money supply in August, recently revisedupward from 4.1% and uncomfortably close to the upper end ofthe Bundesbank's target range. Much of the gain was becauseof government borrowing, which the bank said can't bemaintained at current levels.   The central bank didn't indicate whether it planned tobring on another round of rate increases soon. Butprivate-sector economists say more increases may not be faroff, particularly as Germany's trading partners acknowledgethat its special situation has forced it to make moves thatrun counter to the growth policies that are being emphasizedelsewhere.   The Bundesbank says Germany's enormous fiscal expansioncan't be kept up for long and already is threatening thestability of the mark. So far, a strong currency has shieldedGermany from imported inflation. But if shifting marketsentiments weaken the mark in the near term, as many analystsexpect, policy makers will face rising prices for foreigngoods just as new demand is pulling in imports at a recordrate.</TEXT></DOC>
