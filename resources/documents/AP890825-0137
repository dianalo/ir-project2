The first shipment, a $20 million package of eight Huey transporthelicopters; arms such as machine guns, mortars and ammunition;4-wheel drive vehicles; ambulances; communciations equipment andanti-tank guns, will be sent next week, said presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater.   Later shipments will include medical supplies, 12 more Hueyhelicopters, a Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopter, assaultboats, trucks, medical supplies and airplanes, Fitzwater said.   Hours after the announcement, a official who requested anonymitysaid discussions were still going on with the Colombians about theirspecific needs.   Fitzwater said no U.S. combat troops will go to Colombia, butU.S. advisers will be sent to train the Colombians in operating theU.S. equipment.   ``It's not anticipated they would be in a combat role,'' he toldreporters accompanying Bush on his vacation here.   ``Our only motivation is to do as much as we can as fast as wecan,'' the president's spokesman said. ``We have a war situation inAmerica, let alone in Colombia.''   Bush, in a statement read by Fitzwater, noted attacks by the druglords against the Colombian establishment, including last week'sassassination of a leading presidential candidate, and said:   ``It is time for the United States and other countries of theworld to stand with President (Virgilio) Barco during his courageouschallenge to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric ofColombian society.''   Officials said Colombia is most in need of transportation toconduct raids and apprehend the drug cartel operatives.   The materiel, to be taken from Pentagon stocks, will be paid forwith unspent funds made available through the 1986 ForeignAssistance Act.   The act gives the president about $75 million in discretionaryfunds yearly; about $10 million has been spent this year, said anofficial in Washington.   Noting that Colombia will get virtually all of the money left forthis year, Fitzwater said, ``Since we're using all the money in thefund, it stands to reason we could have used more.''   He also said that the United States has begun shipping a varietyof military gear bought earlier by the Colombian government,including 20 Huey and five Blackhawk helicopters. The StateDepartment was also lending Colombia two helicopters.   The administration's $65 million aid package does not includethose helicopters.   Fitzwater said Bush would propose sending additional aid toColombia in the Sept. 5 speech in which he will detail hisadministration's plan to battle drugs.   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,D-Maine, said that he supports the administration's decision andthat the United States must be united with Colombia in the drugfight.   ``The drug problem will not be solved solely through the use ofmilitary measures,'' Mitchell said in a statement. Nevertheless, headded, ``the drug dealers cannot be allowed to prevail in thisstruggle simply because they are willing to ignore all norms ofcivil society.''   The $65 million package will be in addition to $2.5 million worthof U.S. security assistance to help protect Colombian judges, theprimary assassination targets of the drug cartels.   On Thursday, a paramilitary squad run by the powerful Medellincartel declared it would wage ``total and absolute war on thegovernment, on the industrial and political oligarchy,'' and othersthe drug lords consider their enemies.   Noting that, the State Department on Friday advised Americans toavoid Medellin.   U.S. aid to Colombia in fiscal 1989 was $29.6 million, said StateDepartment spokesman Richard Boucher. Of that, $6 million was inmilitary assistance, $1 million in military training, $7.6 millionin development assistance, $10 million for the drug war, and $5million to protect judges.   Of the $5 million in judicial protection, $500,000 has beenearmarked for armored cars and other equipment, and $2 million in aprogram to train court security guards.   U.S. and Colombia officials are working together to decide howbest to spend the remaining $2.5 million in judicial protection,said Boucher.</TEXT></DOC>
