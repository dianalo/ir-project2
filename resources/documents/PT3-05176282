The plate has a      central surface and a food-supporting plane raised above the central      surface and having a plurality of channels for receiving greasy juices      released from the food. The central surface is preferably inclined to      facilitate drainage of such greasy juices to a lower side of the plate. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Various pans and trays are known in the prior art which are designed to      facilitate drainage of grease and juices generated during cooking of fatty      food. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,579,258 which issued to Heckert on      Dec., 18, 1951, relates to a grill-spatula assembly primarily designed for      cooking bacon and eggs. The Heckert device includes an inclined bottom      surface which feeds into a flat lower compartment having corner drain      points. In use, strips of bacon are placed on the inclined surface so that      grease will run into the flat compartment where the eggs are cooked. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 1,707,532, which issued to Moon on Apr. 2, 1929, discloses a      frying pan which is also designed for cooking bacon and eggs. The frying      pan includes a flat bottom portion and a corrugated portion formed from a      plurality of raised ribs. The ribs are arranged in parallel orientation so      as to provide drainage channels communicating with the flat portion. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,403 which issued to Steinberg on Feb. 22, 1966,      discloses a food storage and cooking tray including means for elevating      one end of the tray, thus creating a sloped bottom surface. </PAR><PAR>  The above-noted patents relate primarily to cooking or food storage pans      and trays rather than dinner plates for serving and consuming food. The      need has therefore arisen for a dinner plate for facilitating drainage of      grease released during consumption of fatty foods. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the invention there is provided a dinner plate having a      central surface, a base adapted for resting on the surface of a table, a      raised perimeter extending around the central surface, and a      food-supporting plane raised above the central surface and comprising a      plurality of channels adapted to permit the drainage of liquids from the      food-supporting plane. </PAR><PAR>  The food-supporting plane may include a plurality of ribs projecting      upwardly from the central surface. Advantageously, the ribs have upper      surfaces which are substantially co-planar. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the central surface is inclined relative to the table surface      from an upper side to a lower side when the base is resting on the table.      The ribs are arranged to permit the flow of liquids from the      food-suppporting plane to the lower side of the central surface. </PAR><PAR>  The dinner plate may also include an upstanding wall located adjacent the      central surface lower side and extending above the plane of the      food-supporting plane. The upstanding wall is adapted to permit the flow      of liquids. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the dinner plate is generally circular or oval-shaped and the      upstanding wall forms a chord across the central surface such that the      central surface upper side has a substantially greater surface area than      the central surface lower side. The upstanding wall may have a plurality      of spaced notches formed therein to facilitate drainage of liquids to the      central surface lower side. </PAR><PAR>  The food-supporting plane is preferably located above a central portion of      the central surface adjacent the upstanding wall. The ribs may extend in      parallel relation substantially perpendicular to the upstanding wall such      that the channels comprise troughs defined between adjacent ribs. </PAR><PAR>  The central surface also preferably includes a non-ribbed portion at the      upper side thereof adjacent the food-supporting plane which is in      communication with at least one of the channels. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the accompanying drawings which illustrate two preferred embodiments of      the invention, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an isometric view of a plate constructed in accordance with the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a top, plan view of the plate of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a front, elevational view of the plate of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side, elevational view of the plate of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is side, elevational view of an alternative embodiment of the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a longitudinal sectional view of the plate of FIG. 5. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  It is well known that high fat diets, especially diets that are high in      saturated fats, tend to raise blood cholesterol levels. Elevated      cholesterol levels have in turn been associated with increased risk of      atherosclerosis which may eventually result in heart attacks or strokes.      Accordingly, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of      reducing dietary fat intake by modifying food preparation and cooking      techniques. However, heretofore it has not been fully appreciated that      significant reductions in fat intake may be achieved by modifying the      design of dinner plates upon which food is typically consumed. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIG. 1, the applicant has designed an improved dinner      plate 10 for enhancing drainage of fatty grease released during      consumption of a meal. Independent testing conducted by the British      Columbia Research Corporation indicates that statistically significant      reductions in fat intake may be achieved by consuming fatty foods on plate      10 rather than a conventional flat-bottomed dinner plate. For example,      consumable fat levels were reduced on the order of 10% by serving rib      steaks on plate 10 rather than a regular dinner plate. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, plate 10 is preferably circular or oval-shaped      and includes a central surface 12. Surface 12 is surrounded by a raised      perimeter 14 which is preferably sloped toward surface 12 and is of      greater height than a conventional plate sidewall. An outwardly protruding      lip 16 is formed in perimeter 14 at one circumferential position to      facilitate removal of grease from plate 10 as described in further detail      below. </PAR><PAR>  Plate 10 includes means for elevating an end of central surface 12 above a      flat support surface 11, such as a table (FIG. 4). For example, plate 10      may comprise a pair of spaced-apart squat legs 13 projecting downwardly      from central surface 12. Alternatively, as best shown in FIG. 6, sidewall      14 may include a base 15 extending beneath the plane of surface 12 for      supporting surface 12 in an inclined position relative to support surface      11. </PAR><PAR>  Plate 10 also includes an upstanding wall 18 which forms a chord across      plate 10, thus dividing surface 12 into a larger first compartment 22 and      a smaller second compartment 24 proximate lip 16 (FIGS. 1 and 2). Since      surface 12 is at least partially inclined relative to support surface 11,      fluid released from food placed within first compartment 22, such as fatty      juices, drains by gravity into second compartment 24, which acts as a      grease collection sump. To this end, wall 18 is provided with a series of      regularly spaced notches 20 to enable flow of fluid into second      compartment 24. </PAR><PAR>  Plate 10 further includes a raised food-supporting plane 26 located in      first compartment 22 adjacent wall 18 (FIGS. 1 and 2). Plane 26 comprises      a plurality of raised, substantially parallel ribs 30 which extend at      right angles relative to wall 19. A series of troughs 32 are defined      between adjacent ribs 30. Ribs 30 have flat upper surfaces 34 which extend      in a substantially horizontal plane relative to support surface 11 (FIG.      6). Rib upper surfaces 30 act as a platform for supporting greasy meats,      such as bacon, sausages, steaks and the like. The grease released when      such foods are consumed on plate 10 is collected in troughs 32 and is      channelled into second compartment 24. The ends of ribs 30 proximate wall      18 are preferably tapered to merge smoothly with surface 12 adjacent wall      18 (FIG. 6). </PAR><PAR>  Wall 18 acts as a barrier preventing meat placed on plane 26 from      inadvertently sliding into second compartment 24. The inventor anticipates      that wall 18 may also serve as a reference landmark for blind people to      assist in identifying where various food items are located on plate 10.      Similarly, handicapped individuals with impaired motor skills may find it      easier to cut meat or other food positioned on plane 26 and buttressed      against wall 18. In this regard wall notches 20 may serve as knife guide      slots. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, surface 12 preferably includes a non-ribbed      portion 28 in first compartment 22 adjacent plane 26. Non-ribbed portion      28 is adapted for receiving relatively non-greasy foods, such as salads or      fruits. Due to the incline of surface 12 referred to above, food placed in      non-ribbed portion 28 is located upstream from plane 26 and hence such      food will not be fouled by grease released from meat placed on plane 26. </PAR><PAR>  The ends of ribs 30 remote from wall 18 are preferably joined to define a      transverse raised segment 38 extending across surface 12. Segment 38 has a      central interruption to ensure that non-ribbed portion 28 is in      communication with at least a central trough 33 (FIG. 2). This ensures      that any fluid released from food placed on non-ribbed portion 28 will      also be channelled through central trough 33 into second compartment 24. </PAR><PAR>  As shown best in FIG. 2, raised segment 38 may be slightly angled to      facilitate fluid flow into central trough 33. To this end, segment 38 may      also be rounded where it merges with sidewall 14. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment shown in the drawings, non-ribbed portion 28 is a smooth,      planar surface. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), non-ribbed      portion 28 may comprise opposed planar surfaces or a shallow concave      surface which is uniformly inclined toward central trough 33. That is,      non-ribbed portion 28 may be laterally inclined (i.e. toward central      trough 33) in addition to being longitudinally inclined (i.e. toward      second compartment 24) to facilitate fluid drainage as discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  Grease collected in second compartment 24 may be conveniently poured      through lip 16 into another container for disposal or measurement. If      desired, second compartment 24 may also be used as a sump for gravy, dip,      sauces and the like thereby preventing such fluids from migrating over the      entire plate as is often the case with regular flat-bottomed dinner      plates. </PAR><PAR>  Plate 10 is preferably constructed from non-metallic material suitable for      use in microwave ovens and dishwashers. By using plate 10 as both a      cooking and eating utensil less clean-up is required after a meal. The      storage advantages of plate 10 should also be readily apparent. When      leftovers are placed within plate first compartment 22 and are      refrigerated, excess grease will drain into compartment 24 rather than      congealing around the stored food. </PAR><PAR>  As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the      foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in      the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope      thereof. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be construed in      accordance with the substance defined by the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
