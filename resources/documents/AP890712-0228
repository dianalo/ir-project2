The action was in response to 135 letters requesting it.   It provides for specific afternoon Masses in July and August atchapels of several parishes in Canton, Ohio, for persons who hadasked for services in the Tridentine Mass, as used before English inthe liturgy became customary..   The Rev. Bradford Helman, diocesan vicar for worship, emphasizedthat regular parish Masses would remain in English. He said arecently formed group, Ecclesias Dei, based in Glenview, Ill., hasmisrepresented that the Tridentine Mass is the will of the pope.   Deploring such confusion, Helman said ``the Tridentine Mass bythe typical Mass-goer is neither the will of the Holy Father nor theagenda for the contemporary church.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs July 14</NOTE></DOC>
