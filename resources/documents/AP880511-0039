Over the past year, Iran has mounted an ambitious program tofinance religious centers, medical clinics and anti-Israeliguerrillas. Israeli officials estimate Iran is spending up to $100million a year on such projects.   The vehicle for planting the seeds of Iran's revolution has beenthe pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which until recentweeks had been operating openly in southern Lebanon.   Officials of the rival militia Amal, which means Hope, claimHezbollah's influence has been eliminated in the south after aseries of clashes. But analysts say Hezbollah guerrillas have notbeen neutralized, only driven underground where they are harder tofind.   The Iranians remain in the south despite the recent destructionof their office in the port city of Tyre by Amal guerrillas.   An official with the United Nations observer force who demandedanonymity said about 30 Iranian Revolutionary Guards are stationedin the south, providing military planning and intelligence forvillage-based Hezbollah militiamen.   Hezbollah, which Israeli and foreign diplomats estimate canfield 400 to 500 guerrillas, carried out more than half the 75attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon in April. ThreeIsraeli-backed Lebanese militiamen and six Hezbollah fighters werekilled in April.   The Iranians, who also have about 800 Revolutionary Guards basedin the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, stay in the background inthe south but are closely involved in the planning and tactics offighting, officials say.   ``They never participate directly, but they do plan and controlthe attacks, providing the reconnaisance and drawing up the attackplans,'' the U.N. official said.   Uri Lubrani, the Israeli government's coordinator of Lebanonpolicy, said Israel knew the Iranians had been ``tacticallyinvolved'' in the clashes in south Lebanon.   Lubrani, a former Israeli ambassador to Teheran, said in aninterview that Iran was spending up to $100 million annually inLebanon, much of it in the south, where more than 70 percent of the300,000 residents are Shiite Moslems.   Most of Iran's 44 million people are Shiites, a minority sectwithin the Moslem world, where most faithful are Sunni Moslems.   Lubrani said Iran was investing in schools, mosques and trainingcenters in a calculated policy of establishing long-term influence.   ``They want to buy the souls of the new generation,'' Lubranisaid in his Defense Ministry office. ``It is amazing that Iranwould have the gumption to do all these things and fight a waragainst Iraq in the (Persian) Gulf.''   Israel has targeted Hezbollah because the group has firedrockets into northern Israel and ambushed troops and alliedmilitiamen in Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' in Lebanon.The zone is a six-to-10-mile-wide strip north of the Israeli border.   Israel also accuses Hezbollah of helping Palestinian guerrillas,who infiltrate from the Bekaa Valley. Two Israeli soldiers werekilled and six wounded in four such raids in April. Ten guerrillasalso died.   Such attacks made Hezbollah's base at Maidoun the target of atwo-day Israeli incursion last week in which 1,500 Israeli troopsand allied militiamen drove out the gunmen. The battle claimed thelives of three Israelis and 40 guerrillas. Hezbollah reported fourof its men missing and presumed captured by Israel.   A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity saidthere were unconfirmed reports of Iranian advisers being present inMaidoun, a village in southeastern Lebanon.   The United Nations observer said the attack, along with recentclashes with Amal, had reduced Hezbollah's strength.   ``Hezbollah's power is much less. The situation is looking a lotbetter,'' said the observer, who is based at the headquarters ofthe 5,800-member U.N. peacekeeping force in the town of Naqoura onthe Lebanese-Israeli border.   The diplomat said Iran's influence was apparent in the tacticsof the Hezbollah fighters.   Orders to carry out attacks are delivered by couriers to smallgroups of militiamen in a half-dozen villages, the diplomat said.The fighters rendezvous at a staging area where weapons arestockpiled, and are not aware of their targets until just beforethe operation begins.   ``When it's over they go back to their villages, dressed incivilian clothes, without arms,'' the diplomat said. ``It makesthem a very elusive enemy for anyone trying to find them.''   Starting in early April, Hezbollah guerrillas also were targetedby Amal, which has the support of the vast majority of villages inthe south.   In recent clashes, Amal drove Hezbollah fighters out of villageswhere they had established control, Israeli officials and foreigndiplomats say.   Lebanese journalists in south Lebanon said that in the past fewdays 175 Hezbollah supporters had been rounded up, and threepro-Iranian religious leaders had been expelled from the area.   Hezbollah, which is directed by Iranian advisers and religioussheiks, seeks to create an Iranian-inspired Islamic Republic inLebanon in which Shiites dominate other religious sects.   Amal takes a more moderate line, supporting the traditionalmulti-community system. Amal's policy also is to limit carefullyattacks against Israeli forces to the buffer zone and not to attackIsrael proper to avoid severe reprisals.</TEXT></DOC>
