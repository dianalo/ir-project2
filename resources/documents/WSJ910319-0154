The lobby of the Ministry of Tourism might not seem theideal place for such an exhibition. The artists, after all,belong to the radical Islamic cell suspected of thehostage-takings that have emptied Lebanon of foreigners.</LP><TEXT>   But from his office, two floors up, Nasser Safieddinetries to think positively about the unusual tenants with whomhe is temporarily sharing quarters. &quot;We used to have aslogan, `You can find it all in Lebanon,'&quot; says the directorof Lebanon's National Tourism Council. &quot;Where else could youhave all these contrasts?&quot;   To have stayed in Lebanon during 16 years of war -- andstayed director of tourism -- Mr. Safieddine has had tocultivate a robust brand of optimism. But events in recentmonths have actually given him grounds for hope.   A funny thing happened in Beirut during the Gulf war:practically nothing. For once, the city that has become asynonym for violence looked like the quiet corner of theMiddle East. Lebanese even had the odd experience ofwelcoming refugees, instead of seeking refuge for themselves.The cease-fire last fall in their own civil war, thereunification of Christian and Muslim halves of Beirut andrenewed signals that foreign hostages might soon be freedhave started many Lebanese entertaining strange new thoughtsabout the possibility of life without war.   &quot;Peace? Pieces? We never know which it's going to be. Butwe always hope,&quot; says Nicolette Allam, one of a handful ofAmericans who stayed in Lebanon -- voluntarily -- throughoutits war.   Mr. Safieddine sees silver linings everywhere. A sirenscreaming by the window brings a broad smile. &quot;It's a goodsign of life; it means one of the public services isworking,&quot; he exclaims. Another good sign: George Bush, in hispostwar address to the U.S. Congress, mentioned Lebanontwice. &quot;True, one was the question of the hostages,&quot; thebureaucrat demurs, &quot;but it's good to know he's thinking ofus.&quot;   As Mr. Safieddine drives past the burned-out shells of theHoliday Inn and the Hilton, he thinks of the two millionwell-heeled business travelers who filled sea-front hotelrooms and provided a fifth of Lebanon's annual income in theyears before war began in 1975. Now that the city's warringmilitias have moved out of town, Mr. Safieddine wants to movethe business travelers back in. &quot;When people ask me ifthere's still sectarian fighting in Lebanon, I say yes -- ifyou take the fights I'm having with my wife,&quot; jokes theShiite Muslim, who is married to a Christian.   Three weeks ago, he helped revive the long-moribund BeirutBusiness Forum, a support-group for companies, then set offto Paris and London to acquaint Lebanon's old friends withits new situation. &quot;We're not actually inviting people yet,although they're most welcome,&quot; he says. &quot;It's unfair to saythat Beirut is the ideal place for business in the MiddleEast. But things move quickly in Lebanon. In the past,they've moved quickly in the negative direction. Now they canmove quickly the opposite way.&quot;   There is a long way to go. At sunset, from the unscathedterraces of the Summerland Hotel, Beirut still looksbeautiful, stretching in its wide arc between mountains andthe Mediterranean. At first, dusk is kind to the city, makingit hard to tell whether a ragged patch on the skyline is aconstruction site or a bomb-blasted husk.   But in the end, it is the fading light that betrays thecity's secret. Street lights don't come on, and huge areasremain ominously dark. A miles-long wound of ruined buildingsscars the city's center, marking the old Green Line, whichdivided Christian East from Muslim West. Weeds and wild dogsclaim the rubble-strewn streets. Above, the concrete floorsof bombed apartments hang suspended in space, some draping insoft curves like folded linen.   Mrs. Allam, the American, guides guests to her apartmentusing nearby ruins as landmarks. She was just 11 years oldwhen she came to Beirut in 1970; her father was headmaster ofthe American community school. Now, there is no Americancommunity. But Mrs. Allam has stayed on with her Lebanesehusband. &quot;Life is nice -- you can find whatever you need,&quot;she says, then adds wistfully, &quot;aside from the fact that youdon't have water or regular electricity.&quot;   But enterprising Lebanese have overcome even thesedeficiencies. Hissam Yamoud took the money he earned drivingjournalists to war zones and set up a storefront businessthat competes with the government ministries ofcommunications, water and power. Using a microwave dish, heprovides a phone service that bounces calls via numbers inCyprus, thus bypassing Beirut's beleaguered phone lines. Hetrucks water to apartments, to supplement the city'sinadequate supply. And through mobile generators, he rentsout electricity to round out the city's six-hour dailyration. At $10 a month for 10 amperes, he says, &quot;We're notcheaper than the power department, but we're better.&quot;   At the Central Bank, Saade Chami bemoans this Lebaneseresilience. &quot;Some people consider this to be a plus -- Ihappen to consider it a minus,&quot; says the economist, whothinks people's adaptability lessens the pressure forimprovement. For one thing, he says, Lebanese have made thealmost unthinkable adjustment to a currency valued at 1,000Lebanese pounds to the dollar from a 1975 rate ofthree-to-one. Most businesses now simply price their goods indollars.   &quot;If you go buy a dress, the store owner might do you afavor by taking Lebanese pounds,&quot; he says. To do otherwise,he notes, is illegal, but then he waves a hand as ifapologizing for introducing such an irrelevancy.   But for some, such as Tarif Khalidi, Lebanon'snear-anarchy is one of its attractions. Spread out on hisdining room floor are boxes of carefully packed china,wrapped for safekeeping during the last fierce fighting in1989. Now, Mr. Khalidi is feeling optimistic enough to unpackthe family treasures.   &quot;There's something slightly simple-minded about hope,isn't there?&quot; muses this professor of medieval history. &quot;Butmajor wars historically create new opportunities.&quot; HisOttoman-style house, complete with stained glass and Orientalarches, took a direct hit in the last round of fighting. Hepoints out the hole in the hand-painted ceiling. &quot;We callthat `Beirut baroque,'&quot; he says.   Mr. Khalidi says he could never leave Lebanon: &quot;It's aremarkable example of a headless society -- like one of thosethings one reads about in textbooks of political thought. Manis living without a state, and yet he can manage it.&quot;   For Nada Kobaysi, the challenge has been to manage herbusiness, Prosperity Assurance Co., in a city that is atextbook example of war risk. When she started sellinginsurance six years ago in the midst of the war, &quot;peoplethought it was a strange job to choose,&quot; she recalls. Thefirm survived by refusing to insure against car bombs,shelling or theft by militiamen and by being, as she puts it,&quot;very selective&quot; about life insurance policies. Would-beclients living on the Green Line mostly had their proposalspolitely declined.   These days, Ms. Kobaysi says, life and life insurance area much easier business. For one thing, with the militiasgone, &quot;you don't have to investigate everyone so much,&quot; tofind out if they are combatants.   Five years ago, buying a hotel in the Hezbollah strongholdof Baalbek also might have seemed quixotic. Despite itslocation in the Bekka Valley's most notorious town, AliHusseini couldn't resist the chance to own the luxuryPalmyra, once a haunt of movie stars and royalty. These days,any foreign guest is a celebrity. &quot;We had one in December,and another one in January,&quot; says Mr. Husseini. Most of hisguests have been Lebanese, fleeing shelling in Beirut. He nowis working on a scheme to scotch Baalbek's image as a bastionof radical Islam. &quot;I'm inviting Playboy {magazine} to bringall the playmates for a photo spread,&quot; he declares. Playboy,while amused by the proposal, thinks it's an offer it willhave to refuse. &quot;Let's just say, not right now,&quot; a spokesmansays.</TEXT></DOC>
