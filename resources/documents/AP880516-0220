(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The last two hostages in amedium-security prison were released unharmed Monday, peacefullyending a 59-hour uprising in which inmates took eight guardscaptive and did more than $1 million damage.   The siege at Mack Alford Correctional Facility ended about 10:30a.m. when the inmates released Sgt. Harold Yoder, then surrendered.The other remaining hostage, corrections officer Ronnie Scott, wasfreed about a half-hour earlier.   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' prison spokesmanJerry Massie said as friends and relatives greeted the formerhostages, and nine inmates were strip-searched, dressed in redcoveralls and loaded on a bus.   One guard and one inmate were injured in the violence that brokeout Friday night at the 33-year-old prison. Forty-two otherprisoners, suspected of aiding the nine, also would be transferredfrom the prison, officials said.   ``We assume that they were all involved (in the riot). They werethe ones who were left with the hostages,'' said CorrectionsDirector Gary Maynard.   ``Some took more of a leadership role and others stood back.We'll have to sort that out later,'' he said.   Maynard said estimates of $1.2 million in damage to the prisondidn't include damage to a three-story dormitory gutted by fire atthe start of the uprising. He planned to compile a complete damageassessment.   ``The property is scattered, probably been rummaged through byeverybody,'' Maynard said. ``There was more fire damage than Iexpected. ... It's very discouraging and frustrating.   ``We will subsequent to this do the best that we can to rebuildand replace.''   Reporters found extensive fire damage and vandalism in three ofthe prison's four dormitories. Broken glass and debris coveredfloors and the prison yard, where inmates burned chairs and othermaterials in bonfires.   The nine captors had demanded that they be moved to otherprisons and that their departure be recorded by television cameras,said Joy Hadwiger, corrections spokeswoman in Oklahoma City.   There was no agreement made on where they would be transferred,she said.   The bus pulled out of the parking lot at 11:20 a.m., bound forthe Lexington Assessment and Reception Center. Warden StephenKaiser said they would be housed in maximum-security facilities.   The former hostages were examined and then allowed to go home.   ``We had faith in the Lord and we had peace of mind there,''said Bessie Umsted, Yoder's sister-in-law.   Prison spokeswoman Anita Trammell said 30 to 35 inmates who werenot involved in the hostage-taking and remained in their cellsduring the standoff will remain at the Stringtown facility.   ``They will be contained, stripped, fed and watered,'' she said.``We are going to determine who participated in the hostagesituation _ who set fires.''   The 51 Stringtown inmates heading to other facilities would be``dispersed throughout the system wherever we can,'' Maynard said.   Corrections officials who swept through the building afterregaining control said early reports that a dead inmate was insidewere false.   ``We've finished our head count and everyone's accounted for,''said Ms. Hadwiger. ``There is no body.''   According to authorities, the uprising began Friday whenofficers tried to move five inmates to a maximum-security prisonbecause of a dispute between them and some other inmates.   The inmates initially seized eight hostages _ all prison guards_ but five were released unharmed Saturday, and on Sunday a sixthwas set free in exchange for soda pop, ice cream and cigarettes.   The rioters agreed Sunday night to release the final twohostages and surrender Monday morning before a press pooltelevision videotape camera. The transfer was not shown on livetelevision, but was shown later on news broadcasts.   During the three-day siege, the rioters displayed machete-likeknives with blades about 12 inches long, and three bedsheet-bannerswere unfurled from the roof of the two-story dormitory where thehostages were held.   The first sheet said ``White Power,'' a second one said ``DOCWill Not Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Public andPress.'' The third requested help from the media.   ``I feel like the inmates did that for attention,'' Ms. Trammellsaid of the ``White Power'' banner. ``Also, I feel like we havesome racists up there,'' she added.   State Rep. Gary Coffee, one of three state legislators involvedin the negotiations, said the riot started after white inmatesaccused blacks of stealing from them. But state Rep. KennethConverse, another negotiator, downplayed the racial angle.   ``One or two individuals can make it look like a racist deal,''Converse said. ``It's not a racist deal, and it's not anovercrowding issue.''   Maynard said he believes the riot was spontaneous and was notprimarily racial, although he acknowledged that the original fightwas among blacks and whites.   ``It apparently was a fight over a property issue between blacksand whites. It escalated when our officers tried to arrest theinmates. It doesn't seem like it was racially motivated.''</TEXT></DOC>
