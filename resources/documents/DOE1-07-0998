<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0998 </DOCNO><TEXT>The cationic complex /sup 99m/Tc hexakis(t-butylisonitrile)-technetium(I) [/sup 99m/Tc-TBI] is a valuable myocardial imaging agent for myocardialischemia and infarction. /sup 99m/Tc-TBI is prepared by ligand exchangereaction between /sup 99m/Tc-TBI and TBI. The ligand exchange reactionsare studied at different pH values, time, TBI and calcium glucoheptonateconcentration. The exchange yield is determined by paper chromatographyand reaction rate constants are calculated at different pH values. Theresults obtained show that the ligand exchange between /sup 99m/Tc-GHand TBI is a second order reaction and the rate constant of the ligandexchange reaction depends on pH values.</TEXT></DOC>
