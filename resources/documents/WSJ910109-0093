There are the very visible risks of going to war in thePersian Gulf, but also the risks, at least equally serious,inherent in not doing so. The Soviet Union seems almostinexorably to be disintegrating, politically  as well aseconomically -- for good or ill no one quite knows. Acrossmuch of America there is deepening economic gloom -- anincreasingly conspicuous recession that is beginning tospread to other nations as  well.   If 1991 opens as a year of anxiety, 1990 was one of thoseyears many high and mighty individuals and institutions wouldjust as soon forget.   Among the departed or defrocked, the down or out: theMichaels Tyson and Milken; Charles Keating and Marion Barry;Donald Trump and the emir of Kuwait; Danny Ortega and MannyNoriega; Rajiv Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto; Sandamp;Ls and many Pandamp;Ls;Dick Darman's legerdemain and Sam Nunn's bipartisanship;Perrier and &quot;no new taxes&quot;; the Berlin Wall and real estatevalues; communism and Milli Vanilli.   Also, lamentably, global manager Margaret Thatcher, whowas pushed out; money manager Peter Lynch, who bowed out; andfour eccentrically successful entrepreneurs who passed away:Armand Hammer, William Paley, Malcolm Forbes and An Wang.And, finally, the longest peacetime economic expansion inmodern American history.   But if 1990 was a year of falls and failures, it also wasa year of survivals, revivals and hopeful beginnings, some ofwhich ought to more than offset new year anxieties. Germanywas reunified, Western Europe moved closer to economicunification, and North America to becoming a true free-tradecontinent. Free societies and freer markets replaced Marxismacross Eastern Europe and almost surely will survive a winterof discontent.   The U.S., however reluctantly, again picked up its mantleof global leadership, in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. TheUnited Nations actually seems to be realizing its longdormant potential for facilitating great power cooperation.Spreading recession so far hasn't accelerated the greaterdanger of global protectionism. And, the U.S. moved tofurther liberalize immigration, thereby accelerating theinfusion of new talents and energies that are the greateststrengths of American society.   McDonald's opened and thrived in Moscow. Cadillac, FederalExpress, IBM and Wallace Co. won coveted Baldrige Awards forquality. And, amid much gathering economic gloom, there arecounter-trends of revival and resurgence in U.S. &quot;rust belt&quot;and &quot;oil patch&quot; regions disparaged or pitied but a few yearsago.   In one such &quot;Rocky&quot; business comeback, a once down-and-outMilwaukee manufacturer, Harnischfeger Industries, saw itsbusiness boom by coupling traditional Midwest manufacturingskills with a modern global marketing effort for its miningshovels. American competitive instincts and successes, inshort, are alive and well in a great many industrial zonesbetween Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Main Street, asusual, is displaying resilience and resourcefulness despitewoes on Wall Street and hand-wringing in Washington.   Those are just some of the issues and events that theJournal covered, interpreted and editorialized on over thepast 12 months and that it will be focusing its attention onin the months ahead. Very few of these issues and events areuniquely American these days. And neither is the Journal.   It has become almost a cliche to say that business is nowglobal, but that makes it no less true or significant.Japanese bond buyers and Hong Kong real estate investors,British merchant bankers and German industrialists, Italiandesigners and Korean manufacturers, and of course Americanproducers and consumers -- all are playing in the same GreatGame, even if not always by precisely the same rules.   The Journal moves ahead into the '90s with the mission andmandate to cover this global game, not just for its more thanfive million American readers, but for a rapidly growingworld-wide business constituency.   The Journal, founded in 1889, long has been America'spre-eminent business daily, knitting together this nation'sintricate business fabric. Over the decade of the '80s, TheAsian Wall Street Journal, published in Hong Kong, developedinto Asia's dominant regional business daily. And now inEurope, The Wall Street Journal Europe, less than a decadeold, is successfully challenging London's venerable FinancialTimes as the essential international business daily on theEuropean continent.   Altogether more than two million men and women buy theJournal every business day. It is printed in 18 locationsacross America and another six world-wide -- Adligenswil inSwitzerland, London, Heerlen in the Netherlands, Tokyo,Singapore and Hong Kong. A new printing center in Bangkok isscheduled to open this year. As a result, the Journal nowcirculates in more than 100 countries and is availableday-of-issue in every major international business andfinancial center. The Journal has moved into the '90s as theonly newspaper that truly can claim the title of The World'sBusiness Daily.   This hasn't been accomplished simply by satelliting pagesof a U.S. paper around the world, although that is a simpleroute that some other publications have followed. The Journalknows there is world-wide interest in essential businessnews, but it also believes that reader interests andpriorities differ significantly from one region of the worldto another. In short, the Journal, like some of theinternational companies it covers and serves, has learned tothink globally while operating regionally.   The Journal operates as three editorially distinct paperson three continents. Each Journal has its own expert staff ofreporters and editors who cover their region with thedomestic as well as international needs and interests oftheir own readerships foremost in mind.   Yet, all three Journals are much more than regionalnewspapers precisely because they also are inextricablylinked. Each draws on the others' news resources to cover thewider business world and the broader story of global businesscompetition.   All three Journals operate by the same set of editorialstandards -- accuracy, fairness and independence -- that havemade The Wall Street Journal America's most trusted newspaperin survey after survey over the years. And all three speakwith the same editorial voice on world issues -- for example,supporting free markets, free trade and free societies inevery part of the world to every audience, fully sympatheticor not.   News stories or editorials sometimes upset governments orother institutions in various parts of the world, forinstance in Singapore, where The Asian Wall Street Journalhas been effectively banned for its independent coverage offormer Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's regime. Yet, the Journalperseveres in seeking and speaking the truth in every part ofthe world. We pretend to no monopoly on the truth, but thetruths we try to tell our readers are not divisible ornegotiable. If we compromise that independence to serveanyone's agenda in any place, we compromise our credibilityto all readers everywhere. That credibility, of course, isour ultimate asset, and the most valuable benefit we canprovide to you, our readers.   The Journal's evolution from national business daily toglobal business daily is a natural one. It reflects theincreasing internationalization of the news we cover, thereader needs we seek to serve, and also the global marketingneeds of our advertisers. The Journal these days can offer anadvertiser the most influential audience in any major U.S.metropolitan area or any major industrial nation -- or it canoffer the world at large.   The audience that you, our readers, constitute is anextraordinary one by any measurement. It is a globalcommunity of highly educated, motivated and mobile businesspeople and professionals who are leaders in their enterprisesand societies. It's a prosperous community as well: averagehousehold income of U.S. subscribers is $146,000; of Asiansubscribers, $184,000; of European ones, $230,000.   Serving readers is our primary mission. And we seek to dothis both through the quality of the news coverage we provideand the personal care we devote to serving our subscribers.Journals are moved by trucks and minivans, commercial planesand chartered aircraft, from our printing sites to citiesaround the world where they increasingly are hand-deliveredto subscriber offices or home doorsteps.   Delivery, particularly abroad, entails surmounting somesurprising and even exotic obstacles: collision with a horseon the midnight minivan run through rural Germany; periodicconfrontations with over-zealous customs agents or censors ina few still-nervous Asian nations; typhoons in Taiwan andcoups d'etat in the Philippines.   The essential point is that today's news is of usetomorrow morning, not next week, and Journal staffers aroundthe world make every conceivable effort to ensure that thepaper is available when and where readers want it.   The Journal's transformation into a global business dailyis part of a larger corporate expansion that has seen DowJones andamp; Co., the Journal's parent, grow in many newdirections. Through its acquisition of Telerate a year ago,Dow Jones has become one of the world's leading suppliers ofinstantaneous global financial information with some 90,000customer terminals spread across 60 countries around theglobe. This is part of a broader corporate strategy ofproviding business news and information however, wherever andwhenever customers need it.   In Europe Dow Jones is a partner with France's GroupeExpansion and Germany's Handelsblatt in a network of Europeanbusiness publications spanning more than a dozen countriesfrom Spain to Scandinavia and including Eastern Europe.Through this partnership, Dow Jones helps serve Europe'snational-language business news needs. In Asia, Dow Jonespublishes The Far Eastern Economic Review, the region'spremier economic weekly, and has publishing partnerships incountries from Japan to Thailand.   This international expansion and Dow Jones'sdiversification into electronic publishing are among the manyinitiatives and legacies of Dow Jones Chairman Warren H.Phillips, who has announced his retirement at midyear 1991 atthe age of 65. Warren Phillips joined Dow Jones as a newsmannearly 45 years ago, served as a foreign correspondent inpostwar Europe, and returned to lead the Journal and DowJones through an era of enormous growth and success. All thiswas accomplished because Warren Phillips steadfastly has heldthat editorial quality and independence and customer serviceare the highest priorities of this publishing enterprise.   All of the people of the Journal around the world arecommitted to upholding those same priorities and values. Thereporters and editors based in more than 40 news bureausacross the globe and their colleagues in sales, marketing,production, technological support and distribution all joinme in wishing you and your families a healthy and happy newyear.   Cordially,                                                                                                          Peter R. Kann, Publisher</TEXT></DOC>
