The shah's departure from Iran in January 1979 was followed bythe return from exile and rise to power of Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, leader of Iran's 32 million Shiite Moslems, and of thereligious opposition.   On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students overran the U.S.Embassy in Tehran after a three-hour struggle, taking 100 hostages,including 62 Americans. The students demanded extradition of theshah, who was undergoing cancer treatment in New York City, so hecould be tried in Iran as a ``war criminal.''   That idea won swift support from Khomeini, who called on thestudents to act against ``the great satan America,'' but Carterrefused the extradition request.   Carter tried throughout his tenure to gain release of thehostages, but 52 of them remained captive for 444 days and didn'twin their freedom until Jan. 20, 1981, just hours after PresidentReagan was sworn in to office.   Officials from the two nations have met since then atconferences held by international organizations and had contact inthe Hague, Netherlands, where the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal wasformed to disentangle the countries' economic ties.   But not since 1981 have they had official high-level talks onbilateral issues.   However, it was revealed during the Iran-Contra hearings thatthe Reagan administration had conducted secret talks with theIranians in 1985 and 1986 and sold them arms in an effort to buildbetter relations and to win the release of hostages from captors inLebanon over whom Iran was believed to have influence.   Reagan has barred further arms sales but also has said theUnited States would be willing to talk with the Iranians to getthem to moderate their policies.   Tensions with Iran flared again in the past year as hostilitiesincreased in the Persian Gulf region, where Iran and Iraq have beenat war since 1980.   The United States began escorting Kuwaiti tankers flying theAmerican flag through the tense gulf in July 1987.   On the first U.S. convoy through the gulf, the reflagged Kuwaititanker Bridgeton hit a mine. U.S. officials have accused Iran oflaying the mines that damaged the Bridgeton and the USS Samuel B.Roberts last April.   After the Roberts was damaged, the United States retaliated bydestroying two of Iran's Persian Gulf oil platforms. In the ensuingconflict, U.S. forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats anddisabled two frigates.   Iran responded with attacks on Arab oil facilities and U.S.British and Cypriot commercial vessels.   On Sunday, a U.S. Navy missile cruiser shot down an Iranianpassenger jetliner that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft.   Tehran Radio called the American destruction of the Iranianjetliner ``new evidence of American crimes and mischiefs, crimeswhich expose America's nature more than ever before.''</TEXT></DOC>
