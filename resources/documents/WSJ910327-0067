A dozen or more computer and telecommunicationsmanufacturers are selling or planning systems that integratefacsimile technology into their computerized voice-mailsystems. This morning American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. isexpected to announce that it is jumping into the market witha system called Fax Attendant.</LP><TEXT>   Octel Communications Corp., a large supplier of voice-mailequipment, is expected to announce next week a new systemcombining voice, facsimile and data storage.   Combining voice and facsimile in one system is alreadychanging the way companies and individuals handle messages.The new voice-facsimile systems, which store voice andinformation in the digital code of computers, make itpossible for voice-mail systems that hold telephone messagesto store facsimile messages as well. Salespeople, forexample, can then retrieve stored documents from a remotelocation or forward them to a third party. Some systems canbe programmed to &quot;broadcast&quot; the same message to manyfacsimile machines simultaneously.   Small companies such as Kerygma, of Commack, N.Y., led thecharge. Now big players such as ATandamp;T are jumping in.   &quot;Companies can eliminate personnel (yet) give immediateresponses to customer requests for information,&quot; says PeterBernstein, senior analyst at Probe Research Inc., CedarKnolls, N.J. &quot;The services opportunity is mind bending.&quot;   &quot;The marriage of the technologies make the most sense forthe '90s when more workers will be on the move,&quot; notes PaulStockford, senior analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif.He adds that security is better too since &quot;instead of sendinga document to a facsimile room, you can send a message to anelectronic facsimile mailbox and the recipient can retrieveit directly.&quot;   By 1995, Probe predicts that 14% of all voice-mail andvoice-response systems, a $2 billion-plus industry, willcontain integrated facsimile equipment for storing andretrieving &quot;facsimile mail.&quot; Dataquest sees a market with acompound annual growth rate of 93% over the next five yearsto $424 million from $9 million last year.   Kerygma makes a voice/facsimile product called VOFAX thatpublishers can use to provide so-called &quot;Bingo-Box&quot; responsesto advertisements and catalog listings. Call the number atthe bottom of an advertisement for further information andafter punching a few buttons on your telephone a VOFAX willsend you something by facsimile machine from the company whoplaced the advertisement.</TEXT></DOC>
