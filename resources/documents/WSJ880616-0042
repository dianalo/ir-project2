The company's announcement satisfies a notification requirement of the exchange and doesn't commit Central Capital to buy any shares in Inter-City, a natural-gas utility based in Winnipeg, Manitoba.    Central Capital said the purchases, if any, would be made over a six-month period beginning tomorrow.    The financial-services concern also said it may buy over the next six months, through the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges, almost all the shares that it doesn't already own in MICC Investments Ltd. Central Capital said it already owns about 98.7% of the Toronto-based mortgage insurer.    Officials of Central Capital weren't reached for comment.    In trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Inter-City Gas closed at $13.625 up 12 1/2 cents. MICC last traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday, when it closed at 13.375 Canadian dollars, (US$10.99). </TEXT></DOC>
