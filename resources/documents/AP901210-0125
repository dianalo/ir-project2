ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A high-level committee said Monday that NASAmust focus on science - and not on flashy, futuristic projects -both on the space shuttle and on the proposed space station ``if itis not merely to drift through the decade ahead.''   The space science program ``ranks above space stations,aerospace planes, manned missions to the planets, and many othermajor pursuits which often receive greater visibility,'' said thegovernment's Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. SpaceProgram.   It said NASA was trying to do too much and allowing too littlemargin for the unexpected, leading to frequent revamping of majorprograms. The agency should concentrate on two major undertakings:studying Earth's environment from space in a ``Mission to PlanetEarth'' and exploring space in a ``Mission from Planet Earth.''   The committee said the space shuttle should be flown only whenastronaut skills are needed and that no new shuttles should bebuilt after the Endeavour, now under construction, is completed.Instead, the committee recommends that a new unmanned heavy-liftlaunch vehicle be developed and used for all but missions requiringhuman presence.   ``Now it's our challenge,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle, headof the National Space Council, after he was briefed by thecommittee. ``This report will give our space program a needed shotin the arm.''   Richard Truly, the NASA administrator, said he has invited thecommittee and its chairman to meet with the agency's seniormanagers ``so we can deal with the recommendations in the report.''But overall, he said, he sees no major change in NASA's pace ofscience programs.   He took issue with allowing the shuttle production line to closeafter Endeavour. ``We should not give up the ability to build oneif for any reason we need to build another one,'' Truly said.   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate sciencesubcommittee, praised the report as ``a reasoned view of the spaceprogram'' and said it will form the basis of a congressional reviewin the next session.   NASA assembled the outside review at the request of the Bushadministration after a spate of embarrassments that includedgrounding of the shuttle fleet because of leaks on Columbia andAtlantis and a flaw in grinding the Hubble Space Telescope'smirror.   Repairs were made, and Columbia, the leakiest of the shuttles,was returning to Earth at 12:51 a.m. EST Tuesday in Californiaafter a nine-day flight. Atlantis flew last month.   ``NASA is neither as troubled as some suggest nor as good as itwill have to be to carry out the program we have recommended,''Norman Augustine, chairman of the 12-member committee told a newsconference. But he said the agency was at a crossroads.   The committee's report said ``a focus must be given to thisprogram now if it is not merely to drift through the decade ahead.Although there is no particular timetable that can in goodconscience be assigned to this pursuit, it nonetheless sorely needsagreement as to direction.''   Augustine is chairman and chief executive officer of the MartinMarietta Corporation, a major rocket builder. He said he did notparticipate in discussions of a new heavy-lift vehicle.   Other members of the committee included Edward C. Aldridge Jr.,former secretary of the Air Force, Joseph P. Allen, formerastronaut; Edward P. Boland, a former congressman whose committeeoversaw NASA spending, and Thomas O. Paine, NASA administratorduring the Apollo moon flight era.   The space agency already has moved toward a commitment toscience projects. It stopped delivering commercial satellites toorbit after the Challenger disaster in 1986 and last monthconducted its last secret Pentagon mission, although it still hasthree unclassified Defense Department cargoes.   The committee said the civil space program is overly dependenton the shuttle for access to space but said it should not be usedfor satellite deliveries, which can be carried out on unmannedrockets.   ``It's a mistake to risk seven people and one-fourth of ourshuttles to place a commercial communications satellite intospace,'' Augustine said.   The committee said a subject not often mentioned is thestatistical probability that ``we are likely to lose another spaceshuttle in the next several years, probably before the plannedspace station is completely established on orbit.''   The report did not mince words about the space station, whichhad been planned for the mid-'90s but has run into major financingand other snags.   ``We do not believe that the space station Freedom, as we nowknow it, can be justified solely on the basis of the non-biologicalscience it can perform,'' the committee said. Instead itsobjectives should be only two: primarily, life sciences andsecondarily, microgravity experimentation.   ``We believe the space station Freedom can be simplified,reduced in cost, and constructed on a more evolutionary, modularbasis that enables end-to-end testing of most systems prior tolaunch,'' the report said.   The committee sought to deflect suggestions that an agency otherthan NASA should be in charge of space activities, saying ``NASAand only NASA'' has the knowledge and expertise to sustain thecountry's space program.</TEXT></DOC>
