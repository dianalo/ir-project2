Rep. John Bryant last month asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady to investigate the joint venture, Star Enterprise, on nationalsecurity grounds. He and three other Democratic members of Congress_ Sens. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and Jeff Bingamon of New Mexicoand Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts _ contended the acquisitionfalls under the law enabling the government to block mergersinvolving foreign interests if there is evidence national securityis threatened.   ``This is a perfect indication of how totally addicted thisadministration is to foreign cash and foreign takeovers to maintaintheir illusion of an economy that's going in the right direction,''Bryant said.   Bryant claimed this week that the Texaco-Saudi deal presented``legitimate national security'' concerns.   Texaco Inc. and Saudia Arabia announced Monday that they hadclosed the deal, under which Texaco and Saudi Refining Inc. wouldrefine, distribute and market petroleum products in 23 Eastern andGulf Coast States.   Texaco said last year it expected to receive $812 million for a50 percent interest in its refining assets and marketing system andan additional $1 billion in benefits and savings.   Bryant contends the deal could seriously increase U.S. dependenceon foreign oil, erode the domestic oil industry, and jeopardizeconsumers through possible market manipulation.   An interagency panel chaired by the Treasury Department, theCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States, declinedrecently to review the venture, a Treasury spokesman said Thursday.   ``The committee decided not to oppose this; the committee decidednot to investigate, that there was no reason to investigate,'' saidthe spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said thecommittee had looked at the proposed venture in June and reached thesame conclusion.   The administration in general favors foreign investment in theUnited States, the spokesman said, ``unless there is an overridingreason _ national security, national interest _ to deny it. We favorinternational movement of capital, and that includes into the UnitedStates.''   The Saudi-Texaco venture would include three refineries, 50distribution terminals, 1,400 service stations and 10,000 franchisedgasoline stations.   Bryant said 96 percent of the three refineries' capacity would beused to refine Saudi crude.   Bryant said that amounts to Saudi Arabia guaranteeing itself anoutlet for crude oil into the American market, giving the Arabnation the option of lowering crude prices while earning increasedprices at the gasoline marketing level.   ``I feel very concerned that it (the deal) is going forwardwithout any review of the type the statute called for. It isconsistent with administration practices to go along with any kindof foreign takeover of any kind of American company. It's been theireconomic policy,'' Bryant said.   ``The purpose of the inquiry was to look and see if concerns wehad had some validity. To not even look is irresponsible andshortsighted,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
