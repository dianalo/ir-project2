Guillermo ``Gemmo'' Trinidad, 45, was media spokesman sinceshortly after Marcos was exiled here in February 1986. Trinidad leftHonolulu for Manila early Wednesday, after visiting his parents andson in Los Angeles.   Trinidad entered the United States in March 1986 on a touristvisa.   After the Immigration and Naturalization Service begandeportation proceedings against him last January for overstaying thevisa, Trinidad applied for political asylum, claiming his life wouldbe in danger in the Philippines now that Marcos foe Corazon Aquinois president.   A hearing on the appeal was scheduled for later this month.   Although he still fears persecution, Trinidad said personalproblems, including a recent divorce, prompted his decision to gohome.   ``I believe the emotional problems caused by the divorce havecaused me to be less effective as spokesman,'' he said. ``I'm stilla bit apprehensive about what will greet me, but if I get arrested,it will help my colleagues.''   Several other Marcos aides seek political asylum here.   Trinidad was married in 1978 and divorced last January. Hisex-wife, Norma, will remain in the United States, as will their8{-year-old son, Juan Reynaldo, Trinidad said.   Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez, Philippine consul general here, calledTrinidad's fears of persecution ``preposterous'' and said manyMarcos allies prosper in the Philippines.   Trinidad said he would work for an export company in Manila, aswell as write a twice-monthly column for a Filipino newspaper in LosAngeles. He's also working on a book detailing his years with theMarcoses.   Near the end of Marcos' 20-year rule, Trinidad was a regionaldirector in the Ministry of Human Settlements, then headed byMarcos' wife, Imelda.   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealingnearly $200 million from their homeland and stashing it in theUnited States. The U.S. government has filed a companion civillawsuit, so that claims against them can continue if the 71-year-oldMarcos dies. He has been hospitalized here for the past eight monthsand remained in critical condition Wednesday.   Although Mrs. Marcos has said the U.S. and Philippinegovernments' freeze on many of the couple's vast assets made itdifficult to pay bills, Trinidad said he got a regular ``allowance''and money played no part in his decision.   Mrs. Marcos downplayed reports that Trinidad left because ofincreasing tension between him and other members of the Marcosentourage, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.   ``Gemmo is a good guy,'' said Mrs. Marcos. ``He can always comeback and he still has my trust.''   His attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, said Trinidad withdrew theapplication for political asylum Tuesday and the INS granted him avoluntary departure order, meaning the deportation proceedings wouldbe suspended.   The INS said Trinidad could apply for a new visa if he wants toreturn to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
