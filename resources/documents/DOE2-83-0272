Expression was under the transcriptionalcontrol of the inducible mouse metallothionein 1 promoter. Recombinantangiogenin was purified and shown to be chemically, biologically, andenzymatically indistinguishable from the natural product. The large-scaleproduction of recombinant angiogenin achieved should facilitate detailedstudies into the structure-function relationships of this potent angiogenicmolecule.</TEXT></DOC>
