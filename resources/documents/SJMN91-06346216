The fact is, he's not goinganywhere.&quot;;   Still, in a week when a million names and a zillion rumors floatpast at the winter meetings, this was the juiciest one yet. Almost like thatJoe DiMaggio-for-Ted Williams talk in the 1940s.;   &quot;He was very excited aboutit,&quot; said Jeff Borris, one of Canseco's agents, who told his client of therumor -- Canseco to New York for Roberto Kelly and two pitching prospects --late Monday night.;   &quot;Jose would actually love to go to New York. He's alwayshit well in Yankee Stadium.;   &quot;He said he'd own the town. He was justkidding, but he could if he was there,&quot; Borris said.;   Canseco said lastseason that he didn't believe he was fully appreciated by A's fans. And hisrelationship with Manager Tony La Russa has been stormy at times.;   For atrade to happen, though, talks would have to get a lot more serious than theywere this week.;   &quot;I would say there are probably more substantiveconversations in this lobby than took place in that room,&quot; Alderson said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Miami Beach, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911211  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  280  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 11, 199100346216,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
