Bush aides said last week they were researching ``scandals''during Dukakis' three terms as Massachusetts governor to use ifDukakis attacks Bush's integrity.   The aides also said Bush would not hesitate to take theoffensive against Dukakis, a point Bush himself is underscoring.   ``There is plenty of evidence to kind of go into aguilt-by-association mode where we can find in Massachusettspolitics,'' the vice president said Friday. ``We've got some cannonfodder.''   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley sounded a similar warning.   ``Politicians live in glass houses and they better be damncareful when they start throwing stones,'' Teeley said. ``I thinkDukakis better be very careful about the so-called `sleazefactor.'''   But Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach indicated the issue would beraised.   ``The vice president knows that the vast majority of Americanshave serious questions about his commitment to ethics ingovernment,'' Dach said. ``This administration is living in a veryprecarious glass house.''   Dukakis frequently criticizes Attorney General Edwin Meese,saying administration officials including Bush should force Meeseto resign because of his legal troubles.   Aides said he would intensify that attack following a Bushcomment Friday that he ``certainly would'' hire Meese if a specialprosecutor investigating Meese's conduct found no wrongdoing.   Dukakis also has derided influence-peddling in theadministration, apparent references to convictions of two formerReagan aides, Michael Deaver and Lyn Nofziger, for wrongdoing inconnection with lobbying of the White House.   Dukakis has never been tied to wrongdoing, but there have beenseveral occasions during his tenure when officials have facedcriminal charges or been forced to resign because of improperactivities.   The governor has a reputation as a reformist dating back to hisdays as a legislator in the 1960s. He was elected governor in 1974and 1982 in elections in which corruption was a major issue.   ``I've been around the politics business for almost 30 years andof all the people I've dealt with I've never dealt with anybodywith more integrity,'' said former Massachusetts Attorney GeneralFrancis X. Bellotti, the state's top prosecutor during eight ofDukakis' 10 years as governor.   New Hampshire Republican Gov. John Sununu, a frequent Dukakiscritic, offered a preview of a possible line of attack last week.   ``Frankly, I think Mike Dukakis is going to have to answer tosuch charges of _ I guess the phrase the media has been using isthe sleaze issue,'' Sununu told a news conference.   Atop Sununu's laundry list was the guilty plea last month offormer Dukakis education adviser Gerard Indelicato to charges hehelped steal $80,000 in grant money. Indelicato had been a Dukakiscampaign worker and was appointed president of a small statecollege, a post he resigned just before being indicted in the fraudcase.   Controversies during Dukakis administrations include convictionslast year of nine police officers and an ex-legislative aide in ascheme involving the theft of promotional exams. A Dukakisappointee had named one of those convicted as superintendent of theMetropolitan District Commission police.   The previous superintendent, named by the same Dukakisappointee, retired after being reprimanded for approving anelectronic sweep of the office of a state legislator under federalinvestigation. Former Massachusetts U.S. Attorney William Weld, aRepublican, thanked the Dukakis administration for its help in the``Examscam'' investigation.   In 1985, the No. 2 man in the state Department of Public Safety,Robert H. Cunningham, resigned after reports he associated with aconvicted gambler.   Helping Bush attack Dukakis is former Democratic Gov. EdwardKing, who defeated Dukakis in 1978 and then lost in a 1982 rematch.King, now a Republican, has attacked Dukakis during recentappearances on nationally syndicated television shows.   But King's own tenure as governor was marred by scandals _ andthat could prove a liability in efforts to attack Dukakis.</TEXT></DOC>
