The actions are a response to American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Multi-Location Calling Plan recently approved by the Federal Communications Commission.    MCI said it will expand its Corporate Account Service to include outbound long-distance services and will introduce a new volume discount pricing option.    Washington-based MCI added that it was trimming rates an average 3.7% for MCI Vnet, its virtual network service, to make it more attractive to medium-sized companies spending $50,000 or more a month on long-distance service. </TEXT></DOC>
