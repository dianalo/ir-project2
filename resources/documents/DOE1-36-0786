<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0786 </DOCNO><TEXT>An oil heater has a wick-fed radiant burner which comprises a wick adjustingshaft rotatable in first and second directions about its longitudinalaxis. A wick holder moves with the wick between an extinguishing positionand a maximum combustion position past a minimum combustion positionin response to the rotation of the shaft. A hatchet wheel is mountedon the shaft for displacement axially of the shaft. An actuating pinis mounted on the shaft to be angularly movable with the shaft. An abutmentbank is provided on the wheel for defining the angular distance overwhich the pin moves, which angular distance corresponds to the distanceof movement of the wick holder between the maximum combustion positionand the extinguishing position. A one-way stopper on the wheel permitsthe pin to pass during rotation of the shaft in the second direction,but restrains the pin from passing during rotation of the shaft in thefist direction, thereby defining the minimum combustion position. Thepin once restrained can be released from the stopper when the shaft isrotated in the first direction by the application of an external rotaryforce sufficient to cause the pin to displace the wheel against the biasingspring while permitting the pin to pass over the stopper. The arrangementprovides improved combustion control and safer wick operation. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
