SamNunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, telling reporters of thecommittee decision to impose a series of requirements before fullproduction of the $500-million-a-copy jet.   ``This is really putting some teeth in `fly before you buy,'''said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the senior Republican on the committee.   The military wants to buy 132 of the aircraft. The stealth bomberis designed to evade Soviet radar but has yet to fly. If successful,the jet could force the Soviets to totally revamp their air defensesystem at a cost far exceeding the price tag on the B-2, Nunn said.   The bomber's maiden flight had been planned for today inPalmdale, Calif., but it was delayed for at least two or three daysbecause of a low fuel pressure reading on one of the plane's gauges,the Air Force said.   In its $305 billion defense bill, approved Friday, the committeebacked Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on a broad swath of issues. Itsupported his decision to end production of several weaponsincluding the F-14D fighter jet.   But the House Armed Services Committee last month overruled bothCheney and its own chairman and voted to authorize production of thenewest version of that fighter.   The Senate panel parted ways with Cheney when it voted to finishresearch and development of the controversial V-22 ``Osprey''tilt-rotor aircraft. It invited Cheney to change his mind oncanceling that program.   The Marine Corps is backing the program to produce the Osprey,which takes off like a helicopter and then flies like an airplane,but Cheney decided to cancel it.   The committee approved Cheney's request to end several otherweapons programs, including production of the F15-E fighter afterfiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991, the ArmyHelicopter Improvement Program, the Phoenix missile, the M88tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine.   Nunn said he expected a fight in the full Senate on thecommittee's decision to increase spending on the Strategic DefenseInitiative by $800 million next year, to $4.5 billion. That's $366million below the administration request.   The committee also:   _Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increasesin flight pay and medical benefits.   _Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste atDepartment of Energy military nuclear facilities to $1.8 billion,$418 million above the administration request. Additional moneywould also be provided for research on new cleanup techniques.   _Included $100 million for research on the proposed aerospaceplane, first proposed by former President Ronald Reagan, which wouldtake off and land like a regular jet but flies at great speeds inthe upper atmosphere.   _Direct the Defense Department to reduce emissions ofozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere.   The committee also provided $30 million for developing lighterand more lethal weapons for infantry soldiers. Nunn said sometimesthe infantry soldiers are given short shrift compared to the morecomplex weapons programs.</TEXT></DOC>
