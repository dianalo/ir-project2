U.S. immigration officials closed their busy office buildingbecause of the choking fumes. State troopers briefly closed astretch of U.S. 41, the southernmost east-west route acrossFlorida, because of near-zero visibility. No accidents werereported.   ``From the window, it looks like the city is in flames,'' saidMiami Beach Fire Lt. Luis Garcia. ``You can't see across the bay(to downtown Miami) and it's getting worse.''   Brush fires are normal in Florida this time of the year, but aremore numerous and intense this season because of an unusually drywinter.   Health alerts were issued because of the choking haze, whichmeteorologists said was lessened by evening seabreezes but wouldremain a problem until predicted northeast winds moved in Wednesdaymorning.   ``I came here for sun and I got smoke _ figure that out,'' saidAlbert Smith, a tourist from Minneapolis, as he squinted into thehaze.   Fires licked to within a mile of the Immigration andNaturalization Service's Krome Avenue Detention Center on the edgeof the Everglades, and Perry Rivkind, INS district director,ordered the 700 aliens there moved to Miami's Bobby Maduro BaseballStadium.   Rivkind said if conditions didn't improve by early Wednesday,the aliens could be sent by bus to an immigration camp in PortIsabel, Texas.   ``It's very serious. We've got an emergency,'' said Rivkind, whoearlier closed the downtown INS headquarters, which is usuallyjammed with people. The Maduro stadium, spring training home of theBaltimore Orioles major-league team, was recently used as amakeshift home for Nicaraguan refugees.   Gerard Jean-Juste, a leader of the Haitian exile community,protested shifting Haitian aliens to the outdoor stadium instead ofletting them go to churches or homes in the Little Haiti community.   ``These people suffered in Haiti, they suffered in Krome. Theyshould at least let the pregnant women and children go,'' he said.   Jean-Juste dropped his protest when Rivkind allowed severalpregnant women and children to spend the night in the care ofHaitian community groups.   The smoke from fires 20 to 30 miles away blocked the sun, andjets were barely visible as they took off from Miami InternationalAirport, where officials said normal operations continued despitethe haze.   Tourists expressed puzzlement when they walked outside to findthey could barely see the beach at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel.   ``It's kind of weird,'' said Lisa Cole, a hotel publicist andlifelong Miami resident.   ``I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was soheavy,'' said Anna Nasher, a federal courthouse secretary who livesin suburban Coral Gables.   The Dade County Health Department and the National WeatherService advised people with respiratory problems to stay indoors.   Some senior citizens who woke up coughing were alarmed, hospitalofficials said.   ``Fear becomes an integral part of the problem for us. Theypanic and call rescue,'' said Dr. John Davison, who said severalhad called for emergency transport to Pembroke Pines GeneralHospital while others flooded the southwestern Broward Countyhospital's switchboard.   At Greenbriar Nursing Center, whose 175 patients all suffer fromrespiratory ailments, workers tried to make sure windows and doorswere kept shut.   ``As this smoke comes into the building, even you or I wouldexperience shortness of breath or a feeling of headache,'' saidadministrator Russell Silverman. ``For people who already haverespiratory problems, you can't have open doors.''   He said visibility around the southwest Dade County center wasless than a quarter-mile.   Forestry officials said 3,000 acres of dried-out sawgrass werein flames west of Miami.   Metro-Dade firefighters have put down four major brushfires nearpopulated areas since last weekend. One blaze had burned anestimated 12,000 acres, firefighters said. Two fires were reportedin Palm Beach County grasslands.   Brushfires have also sprung up sporadically in other parts ofFlorida in recent days. Last week, a series of fires charred 58,000acres along central Florida's Gulf Coast.</TEXT></DOC>
