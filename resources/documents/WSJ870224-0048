Ansell said it has retained Margeotes, Fertitta andamp; Weiss Inc., New York, whose clients include Godiva chocolates, Celentano foods, and VSOP Cognac.    Della Femina created a high-profile ad campaign for LifeStyles that featured a young woman saying, &quot;I enjoy sex, but I'm not ready to die for it.&quot;    The campaign helped pressure a number of publications and television stations into accepting condom advertising. Ansell executives said yesterday that they hadn't determined whether the campaign will be continued. The campaign's creation was recounted recently in this newspaper.    Jerry Della Femina, the agency's chairman, last week abruptly dropped Ansell, a unit of Australia's Pacific Dunlop Ltd., saying he was offended by a remark attributed to Ansell's president, John Silverman, in a recent Time magazine article. Mr. Silverman was quoted as saying: &quot;AIDS is a condom marketer's dream.&quot;    Ansell executives suggested that Mr. Della Femina was grandstanding, and said Ansell had been talking to other ad agencies. In a statement, Ansell noted that it had hired Della Femina &quot;on a month-to-month project basis.&quot;    &quot;We've been looking at (Margeotes) now for three weeks. It isn't just a result of last Thursday,&quot; said Eugene Freed, an Ansell senior vice president. &quot;We thought there was a need to look at other agencies. We wanted to keep our options open. There were some problems&quot; with Della Femina. </TEXT></DOC>
