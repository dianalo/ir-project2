Scott McNealy, president of Sun Microsystems Inc. of MountainView, hailed the line for ``ease-of-use features found, before now,only in personal computers.''   Surrounded by dazzling displays of multicolored canvas artworkat San Francisco's Civic Auditorium, analysts and industry membersgenerally reacted favorably to Sun's machines.   But not all are convinced the company can beat similar productsalready released or planned by major competitors, including ApolloComputer, Steve Jobs' Next Computer System and Digital EquipmentCorp.   ``These are beautiful machines, clearly intended to push thecompany into a bigger market,'' said software designer Ken Burton.   ``But are these machines the right price, the right design withthe right capabilities for the business, school and personal-usemarket?'' he asked. ``Or do the `other guys' have a more suitableproduct for the business desktop? Only time will tell.''   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greaterspeed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphicscapabilities, sometimes including 3-D.   Some models of Sun's new line, priced from $5,995 to $73,900,include or can add sophisticated new graphics and digital soundcapabilities, higher speeds and a $12,900 circuit board that allowsfull-motion video on a computer screen, which can be used forteleconferencing.   The new and revamped products from the company, which last yearhad a 28.3 percent share of the $4 billion annual workstationmarket, are intended to capture a major share of the burgeoningcommercial market for workstations. By the mid 1990s, the totalannual workstation market is expected to be $20 billion. For mostof the last decade, workstations were used primarily by scientistsand engineers.   The company's success for its new line is pinned on itscomparatively vast library of software available for it.Competitors so far have fewer few software packages for theirmachines.   The company's SPARCstation 1, the so-called ``star'' of the newline, will have the ability, for an additional $500, to emulate theMS-DOS operating system of Microsoft Corp. That will allow theSPARCstation to run popular programs written for IBM personalcomputers, although at a lower speed.   SPARCstation 1's $8,995 pricetag does not include a disk drive.   Its speed of 12.5 million instructions per second, or MIPS, isabout four times the speed of the similarly priced high-endMacintosh from Apple Computer and more than twice as fast as themost powerful IBM-compatible personal computers.   Previously, Sun's fastest machine using so-called reducedinstruction computing set technology, or RISC, had a speed of 7mips and was priced at $22,000. Sun's version of RISC is calledSPARC.   The SPARCstation 1 offers built-in digital audio capability,eight megabytes of internal memory, three expansion slots, ablack-and-white screen and a size that is less than half the heightof a traditional PC console. A color-monitor version is availablefor $15,500.   Other new products announced included a revamp of the originalSun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola's fast 68030microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start at $5,995;a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at $29,900; andan equally-fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 that is designedto operate as a ``server'' to interact with many computers on anetwork.   Prime Computer Inc. announced Wednesday that it plans toincorporate SPARC technology in future engineering workstations.With this strategy, Sun hopes to turn its SPARC-based systems intoan industry standard.   Other manufacturers offer machines that compare with Sun's newmodels: DEC offers an eight megabyte internal memory workstation,without disks, with a speed of 14 MIPS for $11,900, but noexpansion slots; Data General offers one with 17 MIPS for $7,450,but with only four megabytes of internal memory and no expansionslots.   Next Inc.'s machine at $9995 will offer five MIPS with threeexpanson slots and 256-megabytes of optical disk storage capacityand eight megabytes of internal memory.</TEXT></DOC>
