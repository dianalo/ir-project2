Wedding day was Dec. 31, 1955, for the nation's two biggest labor bodies, but it brought little bliss to the House of Labor.    Joining the American Federation of Labor (Mostly skilled workers ) with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (largely unskilled) was expected to end 20 years of warring for members. Labor's influence on government was also supposed to rise. But it didn't exactly work out.    Named president of the new AFL-CIO was George Meany, a paunchy 61-year-old who had been president of the AFL only three years. Although he had been a union official with the plumbers since 1922, when he last held a working wrench, he was still untested in big-time labor.    But he soon proved he could duel with smart, young Walter Reuther. Reuther, president of the auto workers union and head of the CIO before the merger, had shouting matches with Meany in port-merger sessions on many issues. Finally, on Julu 1, 1968, the redheaded Reuther, criticizing the AFL-CIO for slowness in winning reform and for its support of the Vietnam war, pulled his auto workers out. His union didn't return to the fold until 1981, 11 years after Reuther died in a plane crash.    Meany also had to deal with corruption. In 1957, he led the expulsion of the Teamsters, the largest union, which was headed by Jimmy Hoffa. The Teamsters rejoined in 1988.    The only winning presidents endorsed by the AFL-CIO were John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter. And the organization's membership as a percentage of the labor force has declined to 11% from 18% in 1955. </TEXT></DOC>
