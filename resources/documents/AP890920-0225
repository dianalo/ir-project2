Written and directed by Bertrand Blier, the movie won a specialjury prize at this year's Cannes film festival and establishedBalasko _ admired for her roles in sidesplitting French comedies _as one of France's foremost actresses.   The film opens the annual festival Friday with a specialscreening at Avery Fisher Hall.   The festival will feature 26 other movies from the United States,Finland, Japan, Taiwan, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, Ireland,Burkina Faso, Poland, Canada, Australia and Hungary.   Closing night on Oct. 9 will showcase Bill Forsyth's ``BreakingIn,'' an engaging story of two small-time thieves written by JohnSayles and starring Burt Reynolds. It is the festival debut for theScottish director of ``Local Hero'' and ``Gregory's Girl.''   The festival will have a special avant-garde program devoted tonew, innovative works by Abigail Child, Warren Sonbert and PatO'Neill.   ``Too Good for You'' is the story of a car dealer (GerardDepardieu) who betrays his beautiful and refined wife (CaroleBouquet) by falling passionately _ and inexplicably _ in love withhis ordinary-looking, overweight temporary secretary.   ``The film's theme is a cliche _ adultery and the rejected woman,but everyone I know was touched, one way or another, by it,'' saidBalasko. ``What happens in the film can happen to anyone, and we allknow it.''   Balasko said Blier, whose past hits include ``Going Places''(1973) and ``Get Out Your Handkerchiefs'' (1977), wrote the filmespecially for the cast.   ``The character played by Gerard is completely passive, which isnot the way audiences are used to seeing him,'' she said. ``Herehe's swept along by his own emotions, torn between his wife,Florence, whom he describes as so perfect there's no room forfantasy, and Colette, who's fat and ugly and ordinary, but with whomhe has a lot in common.''   Blier heightens an overriding sense of malaise by eliminatingstraightforward narrative techniques. Instead, his characters jumpahead, imagining what life might be like, and flash back,remembering happier times.   In one tricky scene, Depardieu and Bouquet's wedding party turnsinto a nightmarish, stuffy bourgeois dinner for their narrow-mindednouveau riche friends who cannot understand why Depardieu throwsover Bouquet for the dumpy Balasko.   ``The film is disturbing because it's full of interior monologuesperformed as speeches,'' Balasko said. ``In one scene I have to getup and say, `I know I'm ugly and fat.' These are the kinds of thingspeople think to themselves, but never say out loud. It was extremelydifficult.''   She's not exactly ugly and fat, but Balasko hardly fits thestereotypes of stardom. She has none of the sex kittenish charms ofBrigitte Bardot or the chiseled features of Catherine Deneuve.Instead, she is a small, heavyset redhead who likes to wearT-shirts, baggy black pants and red eyeglasses.   In the movie, she is made to look her worst, dying her hair darkbrown and sporting unflattering skirts and tight sweaters thatemphasize her full form.   Critics have praised Balasko for her ``courage'' in playingColette, and touted her as a front-runner for best actress in nextyear's Cesar awards _ the equivalent of an American Academy Award atCannes.   Balasko has 18 films to her credit, including ``Les Bronzes''(``The Suntanned''), a satire on Club Med-type organized vacations,and ``Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure'' (``Santa Claus Is Rubbish''), inwhich she plays an uptight do-gooder who gets stuck in an elevatoron Christmas Eve.   Balasko, who has written and directed many films of her own, saysshe is not a part of the French film establishment and never expectsto be. Blier, in fact, is the first internationally known directorto write a script with her in mind.   Blier's ``Menage'' was one of the hits at the 1987 film festival,which also showcased ``Get Out Your Handkerchiefs.''   Betrand Tavernier (``Round Midnight'') returns to the New Yorkcinema fete with the poignant ``Life and Nothing But,'' set duringWorld War I. American director Jim Jarmusch returns with ``MysteryTrain,'' the third in a filmic trilogy that includes ``Stranger ThanParadise'' and ``Down by Law.''   The festival will also show the documentary ``Thelonius Monk:Straight, No Chaser,'' a portrait of the brilliant and moody jazzartist.   D.W. Griffith's epic 1916 masterwork, ``Intolerance,'' will beshown as a retrospective. As part of an eight-year restorationproject by the Museum of Modern Art, the film has been reconstructedto a color-tinted print with more than 30 minutes of newlydiscovered footage. Four separate stories set in Babylon, RomanPalestine, Reformation France and industrial America, grapple withthe theme of intolerance.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, Sept. 22</NOTE></DOC>
