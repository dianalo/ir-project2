Come fallsemester, he'll be a full-time executive who also coaches women's basketballand teaches Spanish.;    But Charles, Foothill's vice president of studentaffairs, doesn't mind because he'll also be getting something that hundreds ofother district employees won't: a paycheck.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COLLEGES AWAITING LAYOFFSFOOTHILL, DE ANZA SET TO CUT STAFF  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on P. 3B of this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     An enormous budget blunder by Foothill-De Anza Community College Districtofficials, combined with a tight state budget, could shrink the district'ssupport staff by 15 percent. Another 500 part-timers also won't be returning.;   The exact extent of the layoffs isn't known because the district has twicedelayed making the decision. Trustees were tentatively scheduled to authorizelayoffs at a July 22 board meeting, and then again tonight. The topic wasremoved from an earlier agenda; tonight's entire meeting has been postponed to7 p.m. Thursday.;    The reason: Officials are hoping to find ways to shortena layoff list that once ran as high as 65 full-timers.;    &quot;It's an uglybudget,&quot; says Charles. &quot;Horrible.&quot;;    The district's growing student bodyshould have enough classes to choose from. But support programs outside theclassroom, such as counselors and tutors, will be cut dramatically.;    And ifunexpected costs surface, the district will have far less money in reservesthan it should under state guidelines. The district is supposed to have abouta $3 million reserve in its operating budget of about $90 million. Instead,the reserve may be as low as $1 million, said business manager James Keller.;   Employees who have worked for the district for nearly two decades havereceived notice that their positions are tentatively scheduled forelimination. Although they can bump employees with less seniority from theirjobs, those positions may have lower pay.;    &quot;There's upset people all overthe place,&quot; said Bill Lewis, cashier in the central office and president of adistrict chapter of the California School Employees Association. Lewis, adistrict employee for 14 years, is among those notified that their positionsare slated for elimination.;    The district's reputation as a model forcommunity colleges began to crumble in April when college Chancellor ThomasFryer announced that his chief financial officer, Jack Mason, had resigned.;   An emergency audit days earlier had revealed that the district's budget wasfilled with phony numbers. Its main checking account, on paper millions in theblack, instead was heading millions into the red.;    An independent expertunearthed $9 million in mistakes. A new De Anza parking garage cost millionsmore than expected, the overrun quietly covered by funds earmarked foreducation purposes. Some revenues, meanwhile, were counted twice.;    Anunprecedented wave of cost-cutting in the spring -- 500 part-time workers losttheir jobs, virtually all optional spending was delayed -- helped to reversethe district's financial nose dive.;    Since then, administrators, facultyand staff representatives have been wrestling with this challenge: how to runDe Anza and Foothill with more students than last year, but with about 12percent less money.;    Although Fryer had promised to &quot;distribute cuts acrossall employee groups as fairly and equitably as reasonably possible,&quot; officialssubsequently decided to slash the support staff the most. The district didn'thave much choice, said De Anza Administrative Dean Jim Buysse, because statelaw requires De Anza to notify any full-time faculty of pending fall layoffsin March. But in March, the college's financial crisis had yet to surface.;   Support staff, meanwhile, aren't protected under the same layoff notificationlaw.;    &quot;We've delayed making the tough choices as to how many people aregoing to be laid off because we didn't know what the dollars were,&quot; saidLewis. &quot;But at the same time, every month we wait, it's costing us morejobs.&quot;;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Foothill-De Anza Community College DistrictBoard of Trustees will discuss possible layoffs at a 7 p.m. meeting Thursdayin Forum 12 on the Foothill campus, 12345 El Monte Road, Los Altos Hills.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM PHILP, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910729  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  663  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 29, 199100211092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
