Reynolds TobaccoCo., a newspaper reported today.   The Atlanta Constitution, quoting unidentified sources withinthe agency, said FDA legal counsel Thomas Scarlett had sent aconfidential report agreeing with the tobacco company's contentionthat the cigarette should not be regulated as a drug.   ``It was a pretty negative report,'' the source told theConstitution. ``General counsel didn't offer much precedent for ourregulating the product.''   The decision would be a setback for anti-smoking groups thathave been urging the FDA to treat the cigarette as a drug becauseof its nicotine content.   Two separate petitions were filed in April by theWashington-based Coalition on Smoking or Health, which representsthe American Heart Association, American Lung Association, AmericanCancer Society and the American Medical Association.   ``Just because you don't see smoke doesn't mean the harmfuleffects aren't present,'' said lung association spokeswomanMichelle R. Kling. ``It's still addictive no matter how you roll itand how you consume it.''   The tobacco company, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based RJR NabiscoInc., unveiled the cigarette this week. Dubbed ``Premier,'' it willbe test-marketed in three cities this fall.   The FDA is not required to rule until late October, and FDACommissioner Frank E. Young already has met with representatives ofsome medical groups and consumer groups. Meetings are plannedFriday with government agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
