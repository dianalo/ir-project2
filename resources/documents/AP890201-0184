Wirth said the measure would set strict goals to reduce certaingases, such as carbon dioxide, that prevent heat rays from escapingthe Earth's atmosphere, thus raising global temperatures.   ``The policy we are proposing today would have other economicbenefits _ reducing oil imports, for example, and alleviating theU.S. trade deficit,'' said Wirth, a member of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee.   The bill proposes studying ways to power automobiles and othermotor vehicles with natural gas instead of the dirtier-burninggasoline and diesel.   The bill, supported by a bipartisan group of 21 senators, alsocalls for reducing U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent bythe end of the century by developing a national energy policy thatstresses energy conservation and promotes the development ofalternative and renewable energy sources.   It addition, it calls for convening an international conferenceto adopt a binding climate-protection convention that would cutglobal emissions of carbon dioxide by 50 percent by the year 2015.</TEXT></DOC>
