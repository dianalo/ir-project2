The assault ended a standoff that began Monday night, when threeinmates jumped two guards and took their rifles at the prison inQuezaltepeque, 15 miles north of San Salvador.   The inmates, along with three others, demanded political asylumin Mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages, a nurse and twoprison guards.   The Mexican Embassy denied the asylum request on grounds theprisoners had been jailed for common crimes, Justice Minister JulioAlfredo Samayoa said.   One of the inmates, identified as former National Guard officerEdgardo Leiva Lainez, threatened to amputate the hostages' arms andlegs if the asylum demands were not met.   Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters Wednesdaythat about 100 prisoners not involved in the hostage-taking tried toflee the prison, which was surrounded by army troops.   The attempted escape provoked the six hostage-takers, who threw agrenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners,Viera said.   ``When the rioters began firing, the special forces intervened,''Viera said.   He said officials sent in 30 Treasury Police commandos afterdeciding that ``dialogue was impossible because of the intransigentattitude of the rioters.''   Reporters at the site saw the commandos blow open the doors ofprison cells with charges and toss tear gas grenades inside to forcethe prisoners out.   Viera said Leiva, two other prisoners and one of the prisonguards held hostage were killed. The guard already had been woundedin Monday night's takeover, he said.   The nurse and the other guard were freed unharmed, while aprisoner not involved in the hostage-taking was slightly wounded,Viera said.   Col. Miguel Vasconcelos, commander of the army brigade thatsurrounded the prison, said another guard and a policeman wereseriously wounded when they tried to approach the inmates Mondaynight.   Victor Amaya Fuentes, assistant director of prisons, said the sixinmates involved in the takeover had been jailed on homicide andassault charges.   The nurse, Candida Francisca Figueroa, told reporters after herrelease that ``I told them it wasn't correct what they were doing,but they said they would leave (the prison) either alive or dead.''</TEXT></DOC>
