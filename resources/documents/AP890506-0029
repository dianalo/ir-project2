Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are used to make foam cushions forcar seats, furniture and carpet underlays. They go into Styrofoampackaging, hamburger cartons and throwaway coffee cups.   They are used in refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners.They are found in heating pumps and building insulation.   Dry cleaners use CFCs. Computer companies rely on CFCs to cleantiny electronic components. CFCs go into varnishes and metalcleaners.   The problem is that when CFCs rise 15 to 25 miles into theatmosphere, they destroy the earth's precious shield of ozone.Scientists say less ozone means more ultraviolet radiation from thesun streams to Earth, increasing skin cancer, causing eye diseaseand damaging marine and plant life, which treatens the food chain.   A four-day U.N.-sponsored conference on protecting the ozonelayer ended Friday. It called for a worldwide ban on the productionand use of CFCs by the end of the century, even though CFCs have anatmospheric life of up to 100 years.   The conference also called for phasing out halons, gases used infirefighting equipment, but it gave no deadline.   In some cases, the CFC ban may hardly be noticed.   In the United States, for example, aerosol cans using CFCs aspropellants have been banned since 1978, except those used formedical needs. Similar measures have also been adopted by Canada,Sweden, Norway and Finland.   However, 80 percent of aerosol sprays in Western Europe stillcontain CFCs. Aerosol sprays also are common in Mexico and SouthAmerica as well as in Japan, which produces about 10 percent of theworld's CFCs.   Without the compounds, the world may find life generally alittle less comfortable and more expensive.   Scientists reported to the conference, attended by 81 nationsand over 100 non-government observers, on efforts to developalternatives for the compounds.   ``We do have a lot of substitutes available,'' said VictorBuxton of Canada's Ministry of Environment.   ``But we don't have the technical options right now tocompletely eliminate CFCs. That doesn't mean we might not have itnext year or the year after,'' said Buxton.   ``If you ask me what is the Achilles heel of this program, Ithink it is refrigeration and existing equipment. We're not talkingabout comfort here, but about preserving food supplies,'' he said.   Buxton said CFC consumption could be sharply cut immediatelythrough ``good housekeeping,'' such as plugging leaks in airconditioners and ending such ``frivolous'' uses such as makingparty streamers.   Other changes could be made. Water could be used instead of CFCsto clean circuit boards on computers, and metals could be washed inacid baths, as they once were. Refrigeration can be done withammonia or helium.   Scientists are scrambling for new technologies. Major companieshave joined to test a family of halogenated CFCs, or HCFCs.   The new compounds dump far less ozone-damaging chlorine into theair but show many of the useful properties of CFCs, said Kevin Fay,head of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy.   In theory, HCFCs could be used to replace cooling liquid inrefrigerators. Thus, new equipment would not be needed.   Fay said U.S. industry alone has spent up to $10 billionresearching HCFCs, but he said not much is known about them yet. Ifthey prove inadequate, he said, the CFC phaseout target of 1999would be impossible to meet.   In addition, the environmental group Greenpeace opposes the useof HCFCs. It says the atmosphere cannot absorb more chlorine, evenat a reduced rate.   The developing countries at the conference said they need helpto develop alternative technologies and products. Delegates agreedto set up a world climate fund, but they left the financing up inthe air.</TEXT></DOC>
