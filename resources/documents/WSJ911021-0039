Starrs is a grave robber. He robs graves of theirsecrets.   Mr. Starrs, 61, a criminal-law professor and forensicscience pioneer at George Washington University inWashington, D.C., digs up bodies to &quot;resolve enigmas andpuzzles,&quot; as he puts it. Yesterday, for instance, he exhumedthe body of Huey Long's alleged killer to figure out if hehas been unjustly accused for the past 56 years.</LP><TEXT>   Two years ago, he dug up some victims of 19th centurycannibal Alfred Packer to see if they'd really been eaten; hedecided they had. Now he's talking to scientists in Greeceabout excavating a tomb believed to be that of Philip II ofMacedonia (to positively identify him). Also on his &quot;to dig&quot;list: Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark fame (to find outif he shot himself or was murdered) and Lizzie Borden'sparents (to determine if she really killed them).   &quot;He's about the best there is in getting the dead to telltales,&quot; says Steven Sohn, a pathology professor at theUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences inBethesda, Md.   But some people have grave concerns about exhumations,which have become something of a minor trend now that newscientific techniques can reveal all sorts of things aboutthe long-dead. The subject became more controversial thissummer because of the exhumation of President Zachary Taylorin Louisville, Ky. A researcher was checking out a theorythat President Taylor had been poisoned; the exhumationprovided no evidence of that.   &quot;The dead should not be subject to endless questions,&quot;says Monsignor William Smith of the Archdiocese of New York.&quot;That's what it means to rest in peace.&quot;   Louisiana state representative Ralph Miller agrees.&quot;Something has to be done about this digging-up mentalitysweeping the country,&quot; he says. Mr. Miller says he receivedletters from around the nation urging restrictions as wordspread of plans to exhume Mr. Long's alleged killer, a doctornamed Carl A. Weiss. Mr. Miller is researching a bill that,in some fashion to be determined, would help keep Louisiana'sdead buried. Rules on digging up the dead vary from state tostate; in Louisiana, Mr. Starrs needed permission from thenext-of-kin and from cemetery officials to disinter Dr.Weiss.   &quot;We stand by the credentials and good reputation of Mr.Starrs,&quot; says Carl A. Weiss Jr., who was three months oldwhen his father was killed.   Mr. Starrs says the living have much to learn from thedead. &quot;We are allowing the dead to speak,&quot; he says. He sayshis interest in mystery was stoked as a youth, when he gothooked on Sherlock Holmes. He believes crime fiction &quot;makesfor an easy dive into forensic science.&quot;   For years, he studied mysteries surrounding famous cases,such as the Lindbergh kidnapping, before he begangravedigging with the Packer case. Now, his cramped lawoffice is cluttered with models of skeletons and books suchas &quot;The Criminologist&quot; and &quot;Gunshot Wounds.&quot; On his desk,several .38 caliber hollow tip bullets rest beneath researchpapers. He proudly shows off a chunk of skull mounted on asouvenir plaque. He calls that an &quot;Al Packer snack.&quot;   That kind of oddball humor is common for Mr. Starrs, animpish man prone to puns and wry jokes. Once, during abicycle trip, Mr. Starrs stopped off in Ketchum, Idaho, toeat breakfast -- sausages and eggs -- on Ernest Hemingway'sgrave. &quot;It added mood to the meal,&quot; he says.   &quot;Mr. Starrs brings levity to a very serious, sometimesdismal science,&quot; says Sherrie Hardwick, one of his formerresearch assistants.   Mr. Starrs also publishes an 800-circulation newslettercalled &quot;Scientific Sleuthing Review.&quot; Recent issues offertips on blood splatterology and show how to take earprints.Blood splatterology, the study of blood stains and splatterpatterns at a crime or accident scene, is fairly new.Earprints became part of his sleuthing arsenal after heresearched a case in Switzerland in which a burglar had puthis ear to the door to see if anyone was home. &quot;Ears arepretty individualistic,&quot; he says.   Mr. Starrs advised a British company in developing a newlaw-enforcement technology called DNA fingerprinting, inwhich body tissue can be used to identify the person it camefrom with virtual certainty. Such advances, in his mind, makeexhumations more and more likely. &quot;The physical evidence isthere and technology is mature,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the time forthe facts to emerge.&quot;   And thus the Weiss case, which has always been a bitmysterious. It's clear that Dr. Weiss did brandish a gun,threatening Sen. Long over a nasty political dispute with theWeiss family. But there are indications that the doctor's gunmisfired. Some suggest Mr. Long was shot by his ownbodyguards, either on purpose or as the hail of bullets firedat Dr. Weiss ricocheted.   Mr. Starrs convinced the Weiss family that an examinationof how the 30-plus bullets entered the doctor's body wouldprovide the answer. He believes that, working with a team ofexperts and a great deal of physical evidence, he can find ananswer based on showing, for instance, whether Dr. Weiss wasstanding or falling when he was shot.   So yesterday morning, Mr. Starrs and his team dug up Dr.Weiss's body at the Roselawn Memorial Cemetery in BatonRouge, La. Mr. Starrs says Dr. Weiss still had his hair andhis clothes. Asked if the sight of a 56-year-old corpsewasn't a bit horrible, Mr. Starrs replies that, quite thecontrary, he was &quot;riding a high wave of exuberance andsuccess.&quot; He will study the remains further at the LafayetteParish Forensic Laboratory.   Mr. Starrs says all of the groundwork he did before theexhumation makes his work more acceptable than the ZacharyTaylor exhumation, of which he had no part. He calls thatexhumation &quot;bungled&quot; and disparagingly compares it to GeraldoRivera's opening of Al Capone's empty vault on prime timetelevision. &quot;If one does projects with an all or nothingapproach,&quot; Mr. Starrs says, &quot;the public will lose faith inthe scientific value of exhumations.&quot;   The Taylor case's failing, he says, was that researchershad just a hunch and a corpse rather than the mass ofevidence -- bullets, the gun Weiss allegedly used, anddocuments -- he amasses before opening a grave.   The Taylor researchers, on the other hand, feel that Mr.Starrs's experience with bodies is far more limited thantheir own. George R. Nichols II, the chief medical examinerfor the state of Kentucky, who was involved in the Taylorcase, says: &quot;Nothing was bungled about it. It was doneproperly.&quot; And, he adds: &quot;The professor doesn't do what we doday in and day out. If allegations of poisoning are made bycredible sources, then we in forensic sciences will deal withit.&quot;   Mr. Starrs will present his findings on Dr. Weiss at theannual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciencenext spring in New Orleans. &quot;I'm either going down in historyor in infamy,&quot; he says.   When all the tests are done, this time Dr. Weiss's sonplans to have the body cremated.</TEXT></DOC>
