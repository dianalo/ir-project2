Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told the U.N.General Assembly that after more than one year and 15 rounds ofU.N.-sponsored talks, virtually no progress has been made sinceestablishment of a cease-fire.   He called on the international community and the SecurityCouncil to put pressure on Iraq to withdraw immediately tointernational borders and release all prisoners of war, as demandedin a Security Council resolution. Iran, he said, is ready to complyfully with all obligations.   Iraq, in turn, has repeatedly accused Iran of bogging down peacetalks. At a summit conference of the non-aligned movement inBelgrade, Yugoslavia, on Sept. 5, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Azizcharged in remarks made to reporters that Iran rejects peace talkswith Iraq.   The Security Council on Friday renewed the mandate of the U.N.peacekeeping group in Iran and Iraq for six more months and calledupon both countries to implement the council's peace plan.   ``Iraq has refused to take the very first step in fulfillment ofits obligations ... namely, withdrawal from the territory ofIran,'' Velayati said. ``Iraq has tried to take advantage ofillegal occupation of the territory of Iran for realization ofillegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a warof aggression.''   He said that Iraq ``must realize that peace is to the benefit ofthe two countries and the region. Continuation of the presentno-peace-no-war situation can gradually move the region towardresumption of tension,'' Velayati said.   He said Iran welcomes the forthcoming visit of special U.N.envoy Jan Elliason, U.N. ambassador of Sweden, to both capitals andwill continue to cooperate with the U.N. secretary-general.   ``But if these efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to achange in iraq's stance, other measures must be contemplated,''Velayati said.   Earlier Friday he told a news conference that Iran would useforce to recapture its territory if Iraq does not withdraw. He wasrepeating a statement by Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjaniseveral weeks ago.   In his speech Friday Velayati also condemned Iraq's use ofchemical weapons in their war and said any international ban onsuch weapons, as proposed by the United States and others, mustinclude strong punitive measures.   Earlier Friday, Velayati said his government was ready to helpseek the release of U.S. and other hostages in Lebanon, if theUnited States releases billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozensince the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranianradicals in 1979.   ``If we can do anything to help any country (win release of itshostages), we do not hesitate,'' Velayati said in answer to aquestion. ``But I hope the United States also will take somemeasures in releasing our frozen assets.''   Velayati, asked about the relationship between hostages andassets, said: ``It is not our duty to talk about hostages who arekept in Lebanon, which is another country. Some countries ask us tohelp about hostages and that is based on reciprocity.''   Sixteen foreign hostages, including eight Americans, are beingheld in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalist groups andIran is believed to wield influence with them. Longest held isTerry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, who was abducted 4{ years ago.   Velayati emphasized the new Iranian government, believed morepragmatic and intent on economic reconstruction, ``is against anyhostage-taking and holding innocent persons hostage.'' For severalyears, he said, Iran has exerted considerable effort to help somecountries with hostages in Lebanon.   Velayati, asked about prospects for better relations with theUnited States, said that from the beginning of the Iranianrevolution in the late 1970s the United States ``has had hostilityagainst us and still continues the same policies.''</TEXT></DOC>
