But the Sharks began the second half of their 10-gameexhibition schedule Sunday night with a 3-2 loss to the Quebec Nordiques inRimouski, Quebec, and Coach George Kingston expects to have lines in place bythe time the team returns home for Saturday's exhibition finale against theNew Jersey Devils at the Cow Palace in Daly City.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHARKS ARE SEEKING RIGHT COMBINATIONSFOCUS SHIFTS TO PUTTING LINES TOGETHER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Sunday's Score; NORDIQUES 3, SHARKS 2; Highlight: Joe Sakic scored a goal andassisted on two others to pace Quebec.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;That's something we're beginning to concentrate on a little more,&quot;Kingston said. &quot;We're starting to get an idea of which players work welltogether.&quot;;   Kingston said he was impressed by the way center Kelly Kisio andleft wing Perry Anderson played together during a 3-0 loss to the Los AngelesKings on Thursday, and he said Kisio, Anderson and right wing Brian Mullenmight be grouped together on a line.;   Kisio and Mullen already arecomfortable playing together because they were linemates and close friendswith the New York Rangers before joining the Sharks. And Kisio said theaggressive Anderson would complement their style.;   &quot;Perry is always stormingin there and causing trouble for the other team,&quot; Kisio said. &quot;He creates alot of scoring chances by pressuring players into making mistakes in their ownend.&quot;;   Kingston also has been happy with the play of center Mark Pavelichand right wing Pat Falloon, who have skated together for most of trainingcamp. And when those two were joined by left wing J.F. Quintin in a gameagainst the Vancouver Canucks at the Cow Palace on Sept. 14, the line combinedfor six points in a 6-3 victory.;   Kingston said he expects to keep four fullforward lines and eight defensemen on the major league roster. That means nineforwards and four defensemen still on the roster will be cut before the Oct. 4season opener in Vancouver.;   &quot;We're still sorting things out,&quot; Kingstonsaid. &quot;But our objective is to have a pretty pat lineup for our final twoexhibition games.&quot;;   That leaves a Tuesday game at Quebec and a Thursday gameagainst the Minnesota North Stars in Kalamazoo, Mich., for moreexperimentation.
