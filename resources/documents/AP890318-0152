Pollard is not employed by an Israelifirm which supplies the U.S. military, a Pentagon official saidFriday.   The Pentagon had sought clarifications from Israel after a newsreport that the officer, Col. Aviem Sella, joined Electro OpticsIndustries, which manufactures sophisticated optical devices,including night vision equipment for pilots.   The inquiry was undertaken because under Pentagon policy, theU.S. government might have had to cancel its contracts with theIsraeli firm because of a ban on dealings with an indictedindividual, like Sella.   The Pentagon has seen a letter from the chief executive officerof Electro Optics saying Sella was not employed by the company, saidthe official, who spoke on condition he not be named.   ``We have no information to contradict that letter,'' he said.``As far as we're concerned, that closes the issue.''   Sella was indicted on charges he acted as the handler forPollard, a civilian Navy intelligence analyst convicted in 1987 ofselling thousands of secrets to Israel. Pollard is serving a lifesentence.   Sella is one of several Israelis involved in the affair whom theUnited States is seeking to prosecute. Israeli officials have heldperiodic talks with the Justice Department on clearing up thelingering controversy but have failed to reach agreement.   Sella returned to Israel before his indictment and was appointedcommander of a large air force base, despite U.S. objections. Inkeeping with Pentagon policy, U.S. officials and contractors actingon government business were banned from any dealings with Sella.   That fact, combined with his inability to come to the UnitedStates on business, reportedly hindered Sella in his job.   The weekly Defense News reported last week that Sella left themilitary earlier this year and joined Electro Optics on March 1. Thecompany, one of Israel's leading exporters, has a $10 millioncontract with Martin Marietta Aerospace to supply night visionequipment for the Apache attack helicopters. ElOp also suppliessight displays for jet pilots' visors which allows them to fly atnight.   In response to the Defense News report, ElOp director NathanSharoni wrote a letter to the weekly denying that Sella was employedby the company ``in any capacity.'' That same letter was brought tothe attention of the Pentagon, said the defense official.   ``It is true we did intend to employ him as a consultant,''Sharoni wrote, ``but this intention did not materialize.'' Israelisources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision notto employ Sella appeared to stem from strong indications that theUnited States would object.</TEXT></DOC>
