(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The holidays are prime time for thenation's retailers, but they're also high season for thestoreowners' nemesis, the shoplifter, industry officials say.   ``Thirty-five percent of store losses happen from Thanksgivingto Jan. 15,'' said Glenn Ricker, a former Sears, Roebuck and Co.loss prevention security manager and now a district manager ofinvestigations for Pinkerton, the nation's oldest privateinvestigative and security agency.   Shoplifting is a $40 billion a year scourge for retailers _ andit is becoming increasingly lucrative for criminals such asburglars, said Lt. James Hughes, head of the Tucson PoliceDepartment's major offenders unit and burglary task force.   ``It's newer merchandise, easier than breaking into homes and ithas better resale value when the burglars take it to their fence,''Hughes said.   Uniform crime report statistics compiled by the FBI, based oninformation from 12,019 law enforcement agencies reflecting apopulation of 211.6 million Americans, showed 982,552 shopliftingoffenses in 1988, 3.9 percent more than the 945,671 reported in1988. The average value of stolen property was $104.   There was a 35 percent upswing in shoplifting between 1984 and1988, the FBI said.   According to Hughes, for every shoplifting incident reported,another three to four go unreported.   The National Retail Merchants Association said a study shows``stock shortages'' _ largely a combination of shoplifting andemployee theft _ account for nearly 2 percent of net retail salesin department stores.   The spectrum of shoplifters cuts across age, class and genderlines, and their methods vary widely, said Ricker.   ``I've caught 5-year-olds and I've caught 75-year-old ladies,I've caught guys in wheelchairs,'' he said. ``You don't find toomany 70- or 80-year-olds breaking into houses or cars, but trustme, you find 70-and 80-year-olds shoplifting.''   Among shoplifters' schemes:   _Working in teams, allowing one person to distract a clerk whilethe other steals merchandise.   _Sneaking empty store bags inside the store and filling themwith goods.   _Detaching electronic alarm tags from merchandise.   _Loading items into false-bottom bags, coats or loose-fittingclothing.   _Razor-cutting the top off a cereal box, emptying the contentsand filling the box with more expensive items, such as cigarettes,then retaping the top and going through the checkout line.   An item's size doesn't deter shoplifters. Ricker said he caughtone man who tried to steal a chain-saw.   Ricker estimated that 75 to 80 percent of all such crime isdrug-related.   Attempts to combat the problem are almost like ``trying to dam ariver with sand,'' he said.   Many retailers are turning increasingly to security firms forhelp.   ``We're getting more and more calls from retail sales'' askingboth for uniform security and for undercover investigativeservices, said Ronald Janick, Pinkerton senior vice president ofinvestigations in suburban Philadelphia.   Said Ricker: ``A lot of corporations now are going to contractloss prevention agents rather than their own in-house (staff)because it's a lot more cost-effective.''   Agencies such as Pinkerton take on responsibility for hiring,screening and training agents, insurance, turnover and paperwork.   Pinkerton also supplies undercover operatives who blend in withregular shoppers and the shoplifters.   One such is Dianne Ruhl, a private investigator who previouslyworked as a security agent in department stores in Tucson.   Ms. Ruhl said suspicious or unusual behavior is a tipoff to atrained observer.   Frequently, those caught shoplifting ask if they can just payfor the items. But, increasingly, merchants are prosecuting.   Ms. Ruhl said she recently caught a 25-year-old unemployed manwho had stuffed two packs of Camels between a liner and the outsidepart of his coat.   ``And so he's got a record now for $2.70,'' she said. ``Isn'tthat stupid?''</TEXT></DOC>
