Mr. Paisley, a central focus of the two-year Pentagon fraud and bribery investigation, appointed BDM Chairman Earle Williams to the Naval Research Advisory Committee, a prestigious academic and industry group that met regularly with Navy officials on sensitive military programs. Law enforcement officials said investigators want to determine whether sensitive, non-public information from that committee and similar Pentagon panels was provided improperly to military contractors or their consultants.    Government investigators are also looking into whether Mr. Paisley received sensitive records from the Navy advisory group or its members after he left the Navy on March 31, 1987, to work as a private consultant. Investigators have sought to determine whether any such records were in the offices of McDonnell Douglas Corp., one of Mr. Paisley's clients.    Some links between Mr. Paisley and BDM have been disclosed previously. Before Mr. Paisley left the Navy, the company agreed to hire him as a consultant. Neither BDM nor Mr. Paisley's attorneys have disclosed the details of his consulting contract, but according to other firms Mr. Paisley approached about consulting arrangements, his annual retainer was around $200,000.    Moreover, Mr. Paisley's wife, Vicki, worked both as an employee and a consultant for the company beginning in 1983, two years after her husband became assistant secretary.    Now investigators are looking into how members of the Naval Research Advisory Committee, including BDM's Mr. Williams, guarded highly confidential information. BDM officials haven't returned repeated calls seeking comment on the issue.    Court papers supporting a government search of McDonnell Douglas offices last month sought, among other things, the Naval Research Advisory Committee's 1987 &quot;summer study,&quot; along with &quot;all notes, memorandum, correspondence, and other documents&quot; related to the study. In the papers, the government alleged that Mr. Paisley provided McDonnell Douglas &quot;substantial information obtained from government officials which has been classified and/or confidential or not available to the contracting public.&quot; It specifically cited the 1987 study.    The advisory committee holds a high-level meeting each summer in which senior Navy officials brief committee members on sensitive topics such as how the submarine fleet plans to conduct warfare beneath the polar ice caps. At the meetings, which last about 10 days, experts also discuss technological developments in sensors, communications and data processing.    Each member of the committee is instructed to meet with a Navy attorney to follow procedures to avoid any conflict of interest that might arise in the course of the committee work.    BDM, one of the largest Washington-area consulting firms, gained a reputation in the 1950s by advising the military on the structure of its early nuclear arsenal and on nuclear strategy. Over the years, the company has designed weapons tests and created training programs for the military. And it has won tens of millions of dollars in contracts on some of the Pentagon's newer projects, including the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars.    According to financial analysts who follow the company, BDM several years ago decided to make a push to gain additional business from the Navy -- a new direction for the firm, which long had been associated with Air Force and space-related jobs. However, BDM's enthusiasm for Navy jobs has reportedly cooled in recent months, the analysts say, because it concluded that higher profits margins are available on contracts with the other services.    Meanwhile, in Southern California, people familiar with the investigation said it is focusing in part on Northrop Corp.'s relationship to a Virginia consultant, William Parkin, who formerly worked for the Naval Air Systems Command.    The individuals said Mr. Parkin, who was on the Northrop payroll, may have helped the company get a $3 million preliminary contract last October to design an unmanned aircraft, which Northrop has designated the NV-144. Northrop's design is competing for a development contract to be awarded this year.    Until 1983, Mr. Parkin was deputy for acquisition in the office that subsequently awarded the contract to Northrop under a congressionally mandated program to develop all-services target and reconnaissance aircraft. Mr. Parkin may have maintained contact with his former associates there, the individuals said.    Mr. Parkin couldn't be reached, and a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Northrop declined to comment.    Northrop also retained at least one other consultant, William Galvin, for its unmanned aircraft program, according to someone close to the company. The activities of Mr. Galvin -- a major figure in the overall investigation -- on behalf of Northrop aren't known, this person said.    Separately, prosecutors disclosed that in the past two weeks they have &quot;become aware of several incidents of destruction of documents related to this case.&quot; They didn't identify the individuals or the documents involved, though.    Papers filed by the government in federal district court in Brooklyn include a sworn statement by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica, one of the lead prosecutors, that he is aware of &quot;two incidents of document destruction by persons who are implicated in the investigation.&quot; The filing says the government took action &quot;to prevent further destruction&quot; of documents but adds that potential destruction of documents remains a &quot;serious concern.&quot;    The papers were filed as part of the government's effort to keep certain search warrants and affidavits sealed.    ---   Eileen White Read in Los Angeles and Andy Pasztor contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
