Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance atfront-page newspaper headlines and most say they are too busy withjobs or occupied with other interests to have paid much attention tothe biggest foreign policy debacle of the Reagan administration.   Most are blue- or pink-collar workers, several with thegovernment, while several others are unemployed or retired. Onewoman is holding down two jobs.   Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12thgrade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college andanother has some college education.   Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental healthadministrator and the focus of their lives is work and family, notpolitics and controversy.   On Friday, one of the prospective jurors, a woman who supervises50 employees at the Willard Hotel in Washington, explained that shecircled the name Joseph Coors on the jurors' questionnaire as a namewith which she is familiar because substantial amounts of thebrand-name beer are delivered to the hotel.   Occasional talk by co-workers about the Iran-Contra affair, saidthe woman, had bored her during her 10- to 12-hour workdays.   Coors, who contributed money to the Contras after meeting withNorth, is scheduled to testify for the prosecution at North's trial.   North attorney Brendan Sullivan told the woman that the name onthe cans is the same as the name on the questionnaire and that thebeer magnate would be pleased to know ``you buy a lot of it.''   North, who took the nationally televised congressionalIran-Contra hearings by storm in 1987, has through smiles andgestures made contact from across the courtroom with the potentialjurors who will decide his fate.   But it is unclear whether he has made much of an impression withjurors who say they just barely recall having seen pictures of himin uniform a year and a half ago.   One man sent into the jury pool thought North might be the manwho kept ``blinking'' and ``winking'' at him constantly as theprospective juror underwent questioning from U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell, prosecutor John Keker and Sullivan.   North signaled that the prospective juror had guessed right bygiving him a thumbs-up sign.   Gesell said as he concluded Friday's court session that he wantsa pool of 45 people to choose a panel of 12 jurors and sixalternates. The jury selection process resumes Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
