By allowing a ban on such activities by ATandamp;T to lapse as scheduled on Aug. 24, Judge Harold Greene paved the way for the company to provide a wide assortment of information, such as financial and securities data, videotex -- electronic delivery of information to home television sets -- and news, over telephone lines. The telephone giant would end up competing with electronic publishers such as Citicorp, Reuters Holdings PLC, Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. and Dow Jones andamp; Co., the publisher of this newspaper. Analysts have predicted ATandamp;T's entry would help create a mass market for the fledgling industry.    ATandamp;T has hinted at ways it could crack that elusive mass market. In recent weeks, the company has acknowledged having discussions with Nintendo of America Inc. about providing owners of Nintendo game hardware access to information services using phone lines. No agreement has been announced, and an ATandamp;T spokesman would say only that the company &quot;has a number of options under review.&quot;    In any case, a mass market has been elusive for on-line information service providers. Moreover, major companies including Knight-Ridder Inc. and Time Mirror Co. spent millions of dollars during the 1980s in failed efforts to break into videotex, one type of information service.    Because of its communications prowess, ATandamp;T's entry into information services could provide a heretofore critical but missing link, analysts and industry experts. They pointed out, for example, that ATandamp;T has been spending as much as $2.5 billion yearly on research and development, with emphasis on software. Experts say that one challenge for the industry has been simply the difficulty of using the information and note that ATandamp;T probably could help tremendously in surmounting that hurdle.    ATandamp;T had asked Judge Greene last April to let the ban expire, and he was widely expected to do so, as there has been little opposition to ATandamp;T's entering the information services field. Even the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the Consumer Federation of America, which vociferously oppose entry into the market by the seven regional Bell companies, didn't call for retaining the ATandamp;T ban.    Judge Greene said there is robust competition nationwide in the long-distance industry. Thus, he said, &quot;The monopoly or quasi-monopoly situation that gave life and reason to the electronic-publishing prohibition on ATandamp;T no longer exists.&quot; The ban, part of the decree that broke up the Bell System five and a half years ago, was put in place to protect the fledgling information services industry from potential anticompetitive activities by ATandamp;T, which essentially controlled the long-distance network.    Judge Greene has allowed the regional Bell companies to offer electronic &quot;gateways&quot; that allow customers to reach a variety of information services. But he has retained the ban on Bell companies' providing the services themselves, because the local companies are virtual monopolies with the potential for anticompetitive behavior.    Some Bell companies said they should be allowed to provide the content of data bases over their telephone networks. &quot;We could increase the range of choices offered to customers, for instance by using our expertise with Yellow Pages advertising,&quot; said a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia. </TEXT></DOC>
