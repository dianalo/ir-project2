The business-computer systems maker said it named Robert B. Hitchcock to the posts of chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Richard C. Wilcox as vice president and chief technical officer. John Glade, vice president, advanced products division, was named to the additional post of secretary.    Last week, Richard A. Cortese, the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, and two directors resigned their posts, effective yesterday. The officials resigned to avert a threatened proxy fight by Messrs. Wilcox and Hitchcock, the company's co-founders, who were unseated as chairman and vice chairman in August. Messrs. Wilcox and Hitchcock had retained their seats on the board.    Mr. Cortese had succeeded Mr. Wilcox, and the company had eliminated the post of vice chairman held by Mr. Hitchcock.    The company said its annual meeting will be Feb. 21. </TEXT></DOC>
