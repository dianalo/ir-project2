Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury's plan to restructure thefinancial system would encourage banks to seek nationalcharters from the Comptroller of the Currency in order toescape tighter Federal Reserve monitoring, some analystscontend.   At least initially, the proposal would increase the roleof the Fed by giving it supervisory authority over 7,500state-chartered banks currently regulated by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. But the change could set off aregulatory shopping spree, with many banks seeking nationalcharters to escape the Fed's jurisdiction. The comptrollerregulates the 4,100 national banks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't think the Federal Reserve would be viewed as theregulator of choice,&quot; says John Hawke, a former Fed officialwho is currently a banking lawyer with the firm Arnold andamp;Porter. Moves to escape the central bank's regulation &quot;willleave the Fed with a constantly diminishing base of banks toregulate,&quot; possibly weakening the central bank's ability tocarry out monetary policy, he argues.   Although the comptroller recently has riled New Englandbankers by forcing them to build large reserves against badloans, the Fed is regarded as a stricter supervisor. Anotherreason the Treasury proposal might encourage an exodus fromthe Fed is that it would give national banks more freedomthan state banks to branch across state lines.   The Federal Reserve Board hasn't yet taken a position onthe proposal. But yesterday, FDIC Chairman William Seidmanblasted the proposal, calling it &quot;an invitation to regulatorycivil war.&quot; He called the proposal &quot;very dangerous&quot; becauseit would &quot;take away all our powers to protect the insurancefund&quot; for bank deposits.   The plan seeks to simplify regulation by shrinking to twofrom four the number of bank regulators. The comptroller'soffice would take over the Office of Thrift Supervision andregulate thrifts as well as national banks. It would berenamed the Federal Banking Agency. The Fed currentlyregulates just state-chartered, Federal Reserve-member banks.Shifting responsibility for nonmember state banks to the Fedwould free the FDIC to concentrate on running the depositinsurance program and dealing with failed banks, the Treasurysays.   Recent figures on bank failures sometimes are cited todemonstrate that the Fed is a tougher regulator than thecomptroller. Senate Banking Committee data show that 7.1% ofnational banks failed between 1987 and 1990, compared with4.2% of state banks. In 1990, 2.3% of national banks failed,while slightly under 1% of banks under Fed supervisionfailed.   &quot;This record raises serious questions about the Treasury'scompetence as a regulator,&quot; said Senate Banking Committeemember Timothy Wirth (D., Col.), noting that the comptrolleris part of the Treasury while the Fed is an independentagency. &quot;More important, it raises questions about theadministration's proposed transfer of power to the Treasury.&quot;   &quot;The comptroller's office doesn't look very good,&quot; saysBert Ely, a bank consultant. One reason may be that nationalbanks tend to be larger, more complex institutions than statebanks. &quot;The comptroller is dealing with an inherently tougherbeast,&quot; Mr. Ely concedes. Still, he says, &quot;the comptrollerseems to get surprised more&quot; than the other agencies.   Officials at the comptroller's office reject thisconclusion. &quot;If you separate out the numbers from theSouthwest,&quot; which has a heavy concentration of national banksand where many banks failed in the late 1980s following thecollapse of oil and real estate prices, &quot;there are very fewbank failures,&quot; says Dean Marriott, senior deputy comptrollerfor bank supervision.   He says the higher failure rate in 1990 could be explainedby the fact that the comptroller's office recently hastoughened its regulatory approach by paying more attention tocapital, among other things.   One reason for the better Fed statistics may be that theFed has a proportionately larger examination force -- 990examiners for just over 1,047 banks, compared with thecomptroller's 2,350 bank examiners for 4,178 banks. Thisallows the Fed to perform annual on-site examinations foreach of its banks and more frequent examinations of troubledbanks, possibly catching problems before they grow so seriousas to threaten a bank's survival. The comptroller's officeperforms annual on-site examinations at most, but not all, ofthe banks that are under its jurisdiction.</TEXT></DOC>
