By 1991, the Navy will retire the ASROC nuclear depth charge,the SUBROC missile and the Terrier missile, a total of 1,100warheads, according to Navy officers and documents released underthe Freedom of Information Act.   The weapons originally were intended to provide a nucleardeterrent against attacks on surface ships by Soviet warships andsubmarines. But Navy strategists now believe they can protect U.S.ships from other ships by other means and see a greater threat fromBackfire and Badger bombers based on the Soviet mainland.   The decision to unilaterally discard the weapons was containedin documents obtained by an independent analyst, William Arkin, wasfirst reported in Sunday editions of The New York Times, andconfirmed Sunday by Navy officers who spoke on condition they notbe further identified.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush on Sunday retraced the inauguralsteps of another president named George who took the oath twocenturies ago that cemented him in history as ``the father of ourcountry.''   Participating in celebrations of the 200th anniversary of GeorgeWashington's inauguration as the first U.S. president, Bush saidhis forbearer ``established a precedent for 40 presidents tofollow.''   ``It was Washington's vision, his balance, his integrity, thatmade the presidency possible,'' Bush told a gathering outside thehistoric Federal Hall where Washington was sworn in on April 30,1979.

At the same time, a bipartisan consensus, often rare in foreignpolicy issues, emerged saying the de facto ruler, Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, had to go.   Relations between the United States and Panama have been on theskids since February 1988, when Noriega was indicted by a federalgrand jury in Miami on drug trafficking charges. Then-presidentEric Arturo Delvalle a few weeks later attempted to force Noriegaout, only to be ousted himself by the general.   The United States recognizes Delvalle, who lives in Miami, asPanama's legitimate president, which has led to a political vacuumthat has caused a host of problems, ranging from snags in PanamaCanal treaty negotiations to incidents against American citizens.</TEXT><DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA on Sunday began replacing twofaulty fuel-system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in hope ofmaking another launch attempt as early as Friday.   The launch of the shuttle and its $550 million Magellan Venusprobe was scrubbed on Friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of apower surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel forone of the shuttle's three main engines.   Engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line thatcarries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.   NASA officials Sunday said they would not set a new launch dateuntil Monday. But they said liftoff could not occur before Fridayafternoon.</TEXT><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Cabinet ministers demanded Sunday thatJewish settlers be allowed to shoot more freely in clashes withPalestinians, and Arab reports said a settler shot a 10-year-oldgirl in the head as protesters stoned his car.   The Palestinian youngster, the second shot by settlers in thelast three days, was hospitalized in fair condition.   The increasing violence between Palestinians and settlers in theoccupied territories was debated by Cabinet, with Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin rejecting calls that settlers be allowed freer use offirearms.   But he also warned that the army may have to take harshermeasures against Palestinians unless they accept Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir's offer of elections in the occupied territories asa step toward ending the uprising.</TEXT><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ``drug war situation room'' unveiled by PresidentBush last week and one like it in California may be the nation'smost sophisticated anti-smuggling weapons yet, but some questionwhether such high-tech wizardry can do much.   Bush dedicated the Customs Service-Coast Guard interdictioncenter Thursday during a visit to Miami, where he also addressedtop Latin American drug-fighting officials at an internationalconference.   ``Think of this as one of America's drug war situation rooms, asour early warning network against narcotics,'' Bush said afterwatching a computer simulation of a drug interdiction in whichsmugglers were tracked through the skies and seas off Miami andintercepted by jets and speedboats.   The Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Center, orC3I, is in a squat, peach-colored building southwest of Miami in afield dotted with radar antennas.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Buddy Roemer and legislative leadersprepared Sunday to tackle a $700 million budget shortfall aftervoters overwhelmingly rejected a tax overhaul he said would liftLouisiana out of recession.   Saturday's referendum also left questions about Roemer'spolitical future just 13 months after he took office as a brashreformer promising a ``new Louisiana.''   ``I never worked harder in my life to try to turn this around,''the governor said. ``We're going to keep building, but not as fastas I wanted to.''   Despite a media blitz financed by $1.2 million from backers andthe governor's personal plea for passage in 32 cities and towns,the plan was rejected 55 percent to 45 percent.</TEXT><DATELINE>McLEAN, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They're not as glitzy as the stores at othermalls in this affluent suburban shopping mecca, but the shops atthe brand-new Magic Mall have a few things overtheir competitors.   ``They will teach us kids how to run our own businesses andavoid bankruptcy,'' said third-grader Warren Johnson. ``I thinkthey are fun because they offer different ways of learning. Andbest of all, they are all my size.''   Magic Mall, an elaborate wooden structure housing a dozenenterprises, opened last Wednesday at Kent Gardens ElementarySchool with the goal of ``teaching children here a businessperson's mentality,'' said principal Robyn Hooker.   The mall is a $20,000-plus project that takes up a sparemultipurpose ``pod'' area in an airy, carpeted, skylit new wing ofthe school outside Washington, D.C.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Boston Harbor is getting cleaner, but stateofficials say that's in spite of foot-dragging by the man who madeits filth famous: George Bush.   Bush sailed in during the presidential campaign last Septemberand accused Gov. Michael Dukakis of neglecting an importantenvironmental issue in his own state.   Now, the governor and his top environmental aides are wonderingwhen President Bush will put his money where his mouth was. Theywant the $59 million recommended for the harbor cleanup by Congressbut deleted from Bush's budget.   ``It's hypocritical of the president to come to New England inthe heat of a campaign and fault the man who began the harborcleanup for not doing enough and then, once safely ensconsed in theWhite House, to pull the money off the table,'' complained JohnDeVillars, state environmental secretary.</TEXT></DOC>
