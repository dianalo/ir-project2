Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN CANDA FREST </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Concern about a steep fall of the dollar to new lows was relieved by the surprisingly big improvement in U.S. trade reported Friday. A sustained recovery of the dollar still remains doubtful, however, in the view of currency traders and economists.    The drop in the November trade deficit to $13.22 billion from the record $17.63 billion the previous month came as a shocker to the foreign exchange market. Economists' forecasts placed the deficit around $15 billion and market rumors had the gap running as high as $20 billion. Wednesday's wave of coordinated central bank purchases of the dollar and an announcement of a U.S.-Japanese pact aimed at aiding further intervention led some market participants to conclude that even Washington and Tokyo were expecting a bad number.    So when the figure was reported Friday, the dollar quickly soared 3.9% to 131 Japanese yen, where it stood in late New York dealings, up from 126.05 Thursday. The dollar climbed 3.7% to 1.6885 West German marks from 1.6290. The dollar's late Friday quotes represented its highs for the day.    The dollar opened in Tokyo early Monday at 131.50 yen, up from Thursday's close of 126.95 yen. The Tokyo market was closed Friday, a national holiday.    Despite the dollar's spectacular performance, traders and economists say the show will be a limited engagement. They expect the dollar's rally to level into a relatively narrow trading range with the chance of a collapse greater than that for another takeoff.    &quot;It'll appear that it's going to be a sustained recovery (for the dollar) at first. Then it will settle down into sideways trading,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago, said.    Sharing this view, several dealers said any dollar rally in the next couple of weeks will probably run out of steam at around 1.77 marks and 140 yen. And then, &quot;there are a lot of 'ifs' that could bring this dollar back down,&quot; said Mr. Glass.    The biggest &quot;if&quot; is the same factor that sparked Friday's buying stampede. Market professionals caution that if the dollar can soar in response to a surprise drop in the trade gap, the U.S. currency can crash just as quickly on an upswing in the volatile monthly figures. &quot;Another deficit like October's will wash away the gains we've seen,&quot; said Mr. Glass.    Adds Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., New York: &quot;One month's figure doesn't make a trend. It doesn't tell us this is the turnaround in the dollar.&quot;    Reagan administration policy is also unlikely to let the dollar's value continue to soar, traders said. Driving down its value was the administration's plan for reducing the trade deficit in the first place. A weaker U.S. currency makes imports more expensive and exports more cost-competitive. Traders figure the U.S. won't risk aggravating the trade imbalance by letting the dollar's value rise unchecked.    &quot;There is probably limited upside potential for the dollar given the desire of the administration of keeping the trade deficit narrowing,&quot; Marc M. Goloven, a vice president and international economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    That the trade deficit isn't the dollar's only problem is also restraining market optimism for a major recovery. Continued fear of a recession will keep downward pressure on U.S. interest rates, traders said. Lower interest rates decrease the appeal of dollar investments and, in turn, demand for dollars.    &quot;The U.S. needs lower interest rates to avoid another crash in the stock market,&quot; Masahiko Tanaka, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s New York branch, said. &quot;I don't think the dollar has bottomed out,&quot; he added.    ---                 Late New York Trading                 Friday, Jan. 15, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
