The new prosperity has roiled aonce-staid Spanish society and widened the rift between haves anhave-nots.   Spaniards who once spurned ostentation now are frivolous, bigspenders mesmerized by new financial wheeler-dealers and high-livingpoliticians.   The once-stagnant economy has boomed since 1986 at aEuropean-high 4.5 percent annual growth rate but the unemploymentrate has risen to 18.8 percent from 14.5 percent when the Socialiststook over in 1982.   Nearly every sector, including moribund steelmaking andshipbuilding, has returned to prosperity under Prime Minister FelipeGonzalez's market-oriented policies aimed at modernizing industry,moderating wage increases and curbing inflation.   But the administration appears to have been caught off guard bygrowing popular anger over speculation, misuse of public funds andhigh living of Socialist officials.   ``Spanish society has experienced many and deep changes in itsstructure and institutions in a very short time, and this hasaffected the value system in a special way,'' Juan Diez Nicolas,sociology professor at Madrid University, wrote in a recentnewspaper column.   By late 1985, the government's efforts to encourage domesticdemand to spark an economic recovery started to take effect.   Rocketing sales at El Corte Ingles department store chain, whosegreen and white bags are a middle-class symbol, have made thecompany one of the nation's most profitable.   Spaniards bought more than 1 million new cars last year, up 16percent from 1987, and 30 percent of them were expensive imports.   Corporate and bank profits have tripled and quadrupled,respectively, since 1986, while $16.7 billion from tourism last yearset a new record for the third straight year.   These revenues helped increase foreign currency reserves sinceDecember 1986 from $16 billion to $39.8 billion, according to theBank of Spain.   ``A cult of money and success like nothing we've ever seen hasgrown up in this country,'' says Miguel Roca, spokesman for the 19deputies of the Catalan Minority Party in the 350-seat Congress ofDeputies, the lower house of Parliament.   But the boom has left the country's 2.7 million jobless out inthe cold and poverty remains widespread.   The Socialist General Workers Union and the Communist WorkersCommissions became the bulwark of a social movement demanding thegovernment focus on improving the lot of the estimated 8 millionpeople living under the poverty line.   Secretary General Nicolas Redondo of the General Workers Union,once a key Gonzalez ally, has accused the Socialists of``undermining public morality, the patrimony of the left.''   ``Before it was said that making money was creating wealth andjobs,'' he said. ``Now it is said that making money is an end initself. We are putting aside values such as work, dedication andsaving.''   Gonzalez took office promising the country's 39 million people ahigher standard for ethics in government.   But criticism has rained down on his party following allegationsthat former administration members have peddled their influence ashigh-paid consultants to foreign investors.   Pilar Miro resigned in disgrace as state television directorafter being forced to pay back nearly $35,000 of budget money sheused for clothes to wear to public functions.   The press questioned why the Ministry of Defense bought DefenseMinister Narcis Serra a baby grand piano for his Madrid apartment.   Former Economic Minister Miguel Boyer, the architect of thesuccessful Socialist austerity plan, raised public hackles with hishob-nobbing with the rich and fudging property assessments on a newresidence he is building.   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde calls these incidents``anecdotal.''   `Socialists have shown sufficient honesty,'' she said, ``and thecitizens know that.''   The influential Roman Catholic Bishops Conference has backedunion charges and repeatedly criticized the government for creatingan environment in which ``selfish materialism'' is held as superiorto social solidarity.   Public anger has also risen because of the strain on thecountry's already inadequate social services and infrastructure,which many claim have been neglected because of the government'sdesire to hold down public spending.   When government-union relations soured late last year, the unionscalled a general strike for Dec. 14 to pressure the government tomake a ``move to the left.'' The strike shut down the country for aday as 8 million of the nation's 12 million workers stayed off thejob.   The strike stood Spanish politics on its head as the governmentfound itself rejecting demands from a Socialist union to which ithas been intimately tied, while centrists and right-wingconservatives cheered the unions on.   Six weeks of talks collapsed Feb. 7 with the unions rejecting asinsufficient a government offer of $3.3 billion in unemployment,pension and minimum wage benefits over the next two years.   More recently, rumors swirled that Gonzalez would resign.Communists demanded that he step down, and centrists called forelections earlier than June 1990, when they are required.   But when Gonzalez delivered his annual state-of-the-union addressFeb. 14, he assailed the unions for rejecting the government's $3.3billion offer.   Although a recent poll in the newsweekly Cambio 16 indicated thatsupport for the Socialists had dropped to 35 percent from the 44percent in 1986, Gonzalez pledged to maintain his policies ``tosustain economic growth that is fundamental for the creation ofjobs.''   Sociologist Maria Angeles Duran says the biggest change and thebiggest problem caused by Spain's much-heralded entry two years agointo the European Economic Community ``will be the change in valuesin a still profoundly Roman Catholic nation brought on by thegrowing influence here of individualist and mercantilist valuesflowing from Protestant northern Europe.''   The boom brought forth a new breed of young, aggressiveentrepreneurs, bankers and financiers, some of whom have becamehousehold names by introducing the hostile takeover and merger dealsto the staid Spanish business world.   The Socialist administration encouraged new blood in top posts inbusiness. It also encouraged giant bank mergers, even hostile ones,as necessary to improve Spain's ability to meet competition thatwill come with the European Economic Community's removal of internaltrade barriers by the end of 1992.   Business news has overtaken stories of ideological politics inthe serious newspapers. Readership in the few business dailies hasincreased to the point where the papers themselves became targetsfor takeover by domestic and foreign investors.   Spanish publishers plan to launch two more business newspapersthis year.   U.S., European and Japanese firms and investors have sought tocreate a base for EEC access in Spain, and many have bought outSpanish companies, entered joint-investment arrangements or builttheir own plants.   Direct foreign investment exploded from 1983 to 1988, going from$1 billion to last year's $4 billion.   But great fears remain that the Socialists' inability to reachaccords with the unions will lead to demonstrations and strikesthrough the month of May.   Already, top leaders of the General Workers Union are calling fora debate on whether it should maintain its traditional support forthe Socialists in the next elections.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 5</NOTE></DOC>
