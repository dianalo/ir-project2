In a rare case of budget largesse, the White House has called for a doubling of the NSF's budget over the next five years, to $3.2 billion from the current $1.6 billion. The biggest chunk of that money would be used to pay for new, university-based science, technology and engineering centers. While only 11 such centers are now in operation, Foundation Director Erich Bloch hopes to have as many as 100 by 1992.    &quot;The government has a responsibility in building up the infrastructure of the country,&quot; says Mr. Bloch, who is the envy of other bureaucrats struggling to live on Gramm-Rudman-era budgets. &quot;We have to make sure we have the knowledge base and the people to make a better mousetrap.&quot;    The centers are intended to foster closer relations between academia and industry, and to encourage research in areas that cut across several academic disciplines. Those interested in establishing a center must apply to the NSF, which chooses the applicants it deems most worthy.    President Reagan touted the proposed new centers in his State of the Union address and has made them a key component in his plan to boost American competitiveness. Many members of Congress, caught up in the competitiveness theme, have expressed support for the idea. Both the House and the Senate budget committees have given the idea tentative approval in their budget resolutions for fiscal 1988.    But the centers may be endangered by a strange quirk of congressional organization. The NSF gets its funding in the same annual appropriations bill as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and thus will have to compete for money against proposals to help the homeless and those poorly housed. The congressional subcommittees responsible for funding the two agencies will be hard pressed to provide such an enormous increase to the NSF at the same time they are slashing housing programs to meet tough budget targets.    Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), who heads the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that must decide how to divide funds among NSF and HUD, expressed the dilemma at a recent hearing. &quot;Frankly,&quot; he said, &quot;I cannot think of anything that would be more difficult to do than to double any federal spending program over the next five years.&quot;    Mr. Bloch readily acknowledges that &quot;the appropriations committee has a tough job.&quot; But he and other research advocates argue the trade-off is well worth it.    &quot;The Democrats have to persuade themselves they can give more money to science while taking away money from housing,&quot; says Robert M. Rosenzweig, president of the Association of American Universities. &quot;That's a tough choice, but the returns from investment in science are very large.&quot;    The 11 existing centers, as well as two new centers recently approved by the NSF, are called Engineering Research Centers, and focus on areas such as robotics, telecommunications and biotechnology. The new centers being touted by President Reagan will look at more basic science and technology. But like the engineering centers, they will have to demonstrate an ability to generate support from private industry before receiving government funding.    The Biotechnology Process Engineering Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an example of the government-sponsored centers. It is a strange, hybrid organization, occupying the third floor of a 1940s army-style barracks used for nuclear-weapons research during World War II.    Formed less than two years ago, the center's faculty is drawn from various academic disciplines, including the departments of chemical engineering, biology and electrical engineering. Last year, the center received $3 million from the NSF and a roughly equivalent amount of support from private industry, while M.I.T. paid the faculty salaries and provided the office and laboratory space.    Daniel Wang, director of the center, says its research into biotechnology processes could have widespread industrial applications. &quot;I don't think this could have happened without&quot; NSF support, he says.    Mr. Bloch also believes the NSF program breaks down rigid academic distinctions at universities. &quot;Multidisciplinary research is really needed right now and doesn't find an easy place in universities, which are arranged along disciplinary lines,&quot; he says.    The NSF's emphasis on interdisciplinary centers with ties to industry has disturbed some academics, who fear the agency is moving away from its traditional role of funding basic research that may not have any readily apparent commercial applications. &quot;Some people think that's selling out to the philistines,&quot; says Mr. Rosenzweig.    But Mr. Rosenzweig himself takes a more pragmatic approach, arguing that if Congress and the administration are willing to provide scarce resources in the name of industrial competitiveness, the scientific community ought to take advantage of it. &quot;What it comes down to is that for the moment, this is the only game in town,&quot; he says.    The value of the centers to U.S. industrial competitiveness isn't easily measured. &quot;If you ask me what mousetraps will come out of the biotechnology center at MIT in two years, I can't answer that,&quot; says Mr. Bloch. &quot;There has to be a trust that new knowledge leads to better international competitiveness.&quot;    Whether he can convince Congress to make that leap of faith is unclear. Last year, Mr. Bloch stirred up criticism in Congress by encouraging leading academics to lobby for funds on the NSF's behalf. That was a mistake, he now acknowledges. This year, he's sitting back and hoping for the best. </TEXT></DOC>
