The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates federallyinsured Sandamp;Ls, created a new institution to receive $1.7 billion indeposits of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association,which was ordered closed by Colorado regulators.   After the failed institution's assets are liquidated, federalregulators expect to have spent slightly more than $1 billion.Silverado joins only a handful of financial institutions that havecost government insurance funds that much to close or rescue.   In the largest-ever clean-up of a single insolvent Sandamp;L _ thepending rescue of American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton,Calif. _ the bank board estimates it will spend $2 billion.   In the case of Silverado, the bank board's insurance fund, theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., is pumping $200 million incash to the new, government-owned institution, Mile High FederalSavings and Loan Association, and pledging another $624 million in apromissory note.   Starting Monday, all Silverado depositors with accounts under theinsurance limit of $100,000 will be able to deposit and withdrawmoney as usual at the new Mile High.   The bank board is hiring First Nationwide Bank of San Franciscoto manage Mile High. It appointed a five-member board of directors,headed by Donald F. Roby of Nevada, Mo., president of Farm HomeSavings Association.   The current stockholders and manager won't benefit from thetransaction, the bank board said. The institution's president, W.James Metz, controlled about 90 percent of the stock.   The bank board attributed the failure to ``substantialdissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules andregulations.'' It said Silverado had swapped some of its preferredstock for undeveloped land owned by developers.   Regulators said Silverado was losing money on many of its loansand that much of its investments were direct interests in riskycommercial real estate ventures, rather than in the traditional Sandamp;Lbusiness of home mortgage lending.   The bank board has closed, merged or otherwise ``resolved'' thecases of 148 insolvent Sandamp;Ls so far this year, a post-Depressionrecord, spending or pledging to spend about $23 billion. M. DannyWall, bank board chairman, said last week that he hoped to haveresolved 200 cases by the end of the year.   Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Fridaygave preliminary approval to a program to bail out Tracy CollinsBank and Trust Company of Salt Lake City. Under the program Tracywill merge with the Continental Bank and Trust Co. in Salt Lake tocreate a bank with total assets of approximately $600 million.   In a separate action, the FDIC also allowed Citicorp Holdings,Inc. of New York to purchase Caribank, Dania as a national banksubsidiary. The FDIC had been named receiver for Caribank whenFlorida's comptroller closed it Friday.   About 400 of 3,000 Sandamp;Ls are insolvent and estimates of the costof the total clean-up range up to $100 billion. The TreasuryDepartment is working on a plan for President-elect Bush aimed atdirecting more money to the resolutions without adding substantiallyto the federal budget deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
