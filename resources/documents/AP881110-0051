Republicans estimated they picked up about 16 to 30 seats Tuesdayin state legislatures, far fewer than in the last two presidentialelections. It also appeared that they lost control of threelegislative chambers.   Republicans gained 302 seats in 1980 and 330 seats in 1984, whenPresident Reagan carried state Republicans on his coattails.   ``It's a loss of epic proportions for the Republicans,'' saidTimothy Dickson, executive director of the Democratic StateLegislative Leaders Association. ``George Bush didn't leave anyfingerprint on the state legislatures.''   Republicans confessed to disappointment with the outcome of stateraces.   ``We would obviously have liked to pick up some more,'' saidMolly Gaylord, a field director for the Republican NationalCommittee. She said she hoped for a strong showing in the 1990elections, the last ones before the redistricting battles of 1991.   The number of congressional seats allocated to each state isshuffled every 10 years to reflect population changes. Through theircontrol of state legislatures, Democrats will be able to redrawdistrict lines in a way that will keep safe as many congressionalseats as possible for members of their party.   In spite of the Republicans' assertion that they had gainedseats, the Democrats clearly did better in the number of houses theycontrolled.   Democrats made a net gain of control of one state Senate andRepublicans had a net loss of control of one state House, accordingto figures compiled by The Associated Press and the NationalConference of State Legislatures.   Democrats lost 10 chambers in 1980 and seven chambers in 1984,although they won back some of them in the off-year elections of1982 and 1986.   The elections left Democrats in control of 32 state Senates and36 state Houses, while Republicans controlled 16 Senates and 11Houses. In some other state bodies, power was evenly split. Nebraskahas a non-partisan, one-house legislature.   ``We've held where we've needed to hold and we've picked up seatswhere we've looked for opportunities,'' the Democrats' Dickson said.   But Jayne Victor, director of the state and local department ofthe Republican National Committee, said, ``We maintained our powerbase in key state Senates and had pickups in just about every singleSouthern state.''   The struggle for control of state legislatures centered on NewMexico, Indiana, Washington state, Oregon, Vermont, and Montana.   The National Conference of State Legislatures said 25legislatures were controlled by Democrats, eight were controlled byRepublicans, and nine were split between the parties. Results forother states were unavailable.   Democrats took a 26-16 edge to regain control of the New MexicoSenate, where an even balance of 21 Republicans and 21 Democratssince 1984 had led to a shifting series of coalitions.   In Indiana, the home state of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle,Democrats picked up two seats in the House to draw even withRepublicans, 50 to 50. Democrats also picked up at least three seatsin the Republican-controlled Indiana Senate.   Republicans appeared to take control of the Vermont House. Withsome recounts possible, the balance stood at 76 Republicans and 74Democrats, in contrast to 77 Democrats and 73 Republicans previously.   Montana Republicans picked up two seats to gain a 27-23 edge inthe state Senate, which had been evenly divided with the Democratsat 25-25. But Democrats grabbed control of the state House, 51-49,the same margin by which the Republicans had controlled the lowerhouse.   In Oregon, control of the House was undecided late Wednesday.Voters elected 23 Democrats and 21 Republicans, but 16 seats wereundecided. Democrats previously had a 31-29 edge.   In Washington state, a tight Senate race had Republicans andDemocrats with 24 seats apiece and one district still undecided.Republicans previously had a one-seat advantage, 25-24.   Pennsylvania Democrats picked up breathing room in the stateHouse, where they widened their lead to 104-99, from 99-97 and sevenvacancies.   In Ohio, Republicans slightly widened their lead in the Senatebut continued to trail in the House.   Among other big states, Democrats in Texas, California andFlorida maintained control of both houses, and Democrats in Illinoismaintained their narrow 31-28 edge in the Senate while keeping a biglead in the House.   In New York, Democrats remained firmly in control of the Assemblyand picked up at least one seat in the Republican-dominated Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
