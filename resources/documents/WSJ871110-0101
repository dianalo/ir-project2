The group, which includes members of CNW's senior management, proposed to buy the transportation company's common shares outstanding for $30 each, including $20 in cash, $8 in subordinated debt and $2 in stock of the acquiring company. CNW said it has 18.6 million common shares, assuming conversion of the company's preference shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CNW closed at $25 a share, up $5.    CNW, the holding company for Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co., said its board formed a special committee of its outside directors to consider the proposal and retained William Blair andamp; Co. as its financial adviser. No date has been set for a decision by the board, the company said. The company also said it agreed to pay Gibbons Green up to $10 million if its board accepts a competing offer. The proposed buy-out is subject to approval by the board and by the company's shareholders.    The buy-out proposal is scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. CST next Monday.    CNW said Gibbons Green plans to make a $60 million equity investment in the acquisition and will hold a 57.5% stake in the new company at the completion of the buy-out. CNW management members would invest about $7.5 million for a 7.2% stake and public shareholders would have a 35.3% interest.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In August, CNW disclosed it was in talks with several potential buyers but declined to identify them. The announcement sent the company's stock soaring at the time to $39.25 a share and some analysts put the company's breakup value at as high as $75 a share.    Analysts said yesterday that the Gibbons Green group was attempting to cash in on the much lower price of CNW stock since last month's stock market crash. A CNW spokesman declined to say whether the Gibbons Green group was involved in the earlier talks, or to disclose the names of other potential buyers.    In 1986, CNW earned $43 million, or $2.31 a share, on revenue of $959 million. Until last year, the company was a railroad with about 6,500 miles of marginally profitable track mostly in the Midwest. Its interest in track in Wyoming's coal-rich Powder River Basin accounted for more than half of its pretax profit in 1986.    CNW diversified its business last year by purchasing Dynamics Inc., a Milwaukee-based maker of snowplows for light trucks. The acquisition accounted for 24% of CNW's 1986 pretax profit and 4% of its revenue.    Under the proposed buy-out, CNW said the acquiring company's notes would have a fixed interest rate to be determined immediately before the transaction closing by Salomon Brothers Inc., CNW's investment banker. CNW said interest on the notes would be paid in cash, except for the first five years when it could be paid by the issuance of additional notes. </TEXT></DOC>
