(VMEbus, STDBus and Multibus enhancements)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Andrews, Warren.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The new generation of 33- and 50-MHz microprocessors requiresfaster and wider buses; vendors are either readying products basedon the Futurebus+ specifications or are using new techniques toincrease the performance of such standard buses as VMEbus, STD Busand Multibus.andP;  Mercury Computer Systems is using the VME64specification developed by Performance Technologies that doublesthe effective VMEbus transfer rate during block-move operations;other vendors are planning products based on the specification aswell.andP;  Radstone Technology's SCSI 11 VME card improves totalsystem management by using multiple local buses in a 'free-flow'architecture, which allows existing system performance to befocused where it is needed most.andP;  Heurikon's Corebus VME card alsotakes a multiple-bus approach and supports transfer speeds of upto 200Mbytes per second.andP;  Boards based on the Multibus II and STD32 specifications are also described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     BusesCommunications Boards-CardsVMEbusMultibusEnhancements32-BitManufacturers.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographchartgraph.andO;Caption:   Radstone Technology's 68030-based Multiprocessing Engine.
