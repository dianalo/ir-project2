Before they came on again, the most terrible conflict in human history had engulfed five continents and consumed 50 million lives.    World War II destroyed the fascist regimes of Germany, Italy and Japan, but of course it did not eliminate totalitarianism. Stalin, emerging as a victor, looked on his former allies with contempt as he rang down the Iron Curtain and made Eastern Europe the world's largest prison.    Such profound thinkers as George Orwell and Hannah Arendt then feared that totalitarians might yet conquer the entire world. Orwell in his book &quot;1984&quot; described the merciless efficiency of a modern police state, and his warning was taken seriously in the West. Rightly so, because Stalin and his disciples, under guise of communist egalitarianism, were busily creating such states.    Now we know that the Stalinist scourge, as with the Hitlerian one, could be effectively resisted, given sufficient courage and willpower. The human spirit is resilient enough and the love of freedom deep enough to survive the jackboot. Moscow has been forced by economic necessity and military defeat in Afghanistan to relax its grip on its vast empire, with the result that free expression is once again emerging in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself.    Even in the immediate aftermath of World War II, there were positive changes in world politics, some of them little perceived in the U.S. even today. The 1940s war furthered the breakup, begun in World War I, of ancient class systems in Europe and Asia that had restrained the creative energies of people for centuries. Broader-based democracy submerged nationalistic impulses, moving Western Europe toward a true sense of community. Some Asian nations, having discovered the liberating influences of market economics, have been moving away from authoritarianism and toward Western concepts of law and individual rights.    Indeed, non-communist nations as a whole have become more of a community, with the U.S. democracy and its $5 trillion economy at the center. Japan and Germany have become serious economic rivals to the U.S. but friendly competition in the production and sale of goods and services is to be welcomed, not feared, by peoples seeking higher living standards. There now is a remarkable degree of economic policy coordination among the seven leading non-communist industrial nations.    War must never be taken lightly, but World War II dramatically illustrated the consequences of fearing it too much. The lesson surely can't be repeated too often. In a new book entitled &quot;How War Came,&quot; British historian Donald Cameron Watt reviews yet again the tragic sequence of events between September 1938, when Czechoslovakia was dismembered at Munich, and September 1939, when Hitler and Stalin carved up Poland. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain acted out of a sincere, but misguided, &quot;incredulity that anyone of an age to have lived through the events of 1914-18, let alone to have fought in them, could, wittingly, wish to go to war again.&quot; He did not see that Hitler, motivated by a deep hatred for a society that had once rejected him, was a natural destroyer. His hunger for conquest was whetted, not diminished, when he learned how easy it was to dupe and bully the aristocrats of Europe.    We now believe that had the &quot;ancien regimes&quot; of Europe resisted Hitler early on, World War II would not have happened. They were too weak, morally, spiritually and, of course, militarily. The war began a restorative process, and particularly so when the U.S. took a hand. That restoration proved strong enough to resist the postwar totalitarians in Moscow. Today, with communism in decline and Moscow itself looking for new answers to its deep-seated social, political and economic problems, we can believe more strongly than ever before that the Western democracies will not only survive, but prevail.    Future generations may look back on the mid-20th century and conclude it was then that imperialism, mercantilism and statism reached their zenith and were finally discredited. More and more regimes have concluded that power cannot be enhanced by territorial conquest and oppressive control of the populace. Economic and political power is flowing to those nations that are freeing up their systems and joining the global economy.    But as bright as the future might look, it is still perilous. The Soviet Union may yet conclude it is too far behind to ever catch up with the West's vibrant economies and attempt to seize wealth through conquest or intimidation. That is why the Free World will be risking so much if it falls once more into self-delusion and moral decay. The enduring lesson of World War II is that the costs of appeasement and unreadiness are far more terrible than the price of military preparedness and vigilance. </TEXT></DOC>
