Bush proposed the ``financial institutions special team'' as partof his broader plan to raise deposit insurance premiums to helpfinance the $100 billion bailout of the troubled thrift industry.   The $50 million, which must be approved by Congress, wouldsupport deployment of ``a couple of hundred additional FBI agents''and 80 to 85 more federal prosecutors assigned to Sandamp;L fraud, Runkelsaid.   The extra people ``would double in general terms the criminaldivision's field investment into this kind of activity,'' Runkelsaid.   After he took office last summer, Thornburgh sought a briefing onthe savings and loan crisis and ``as a result of that briefingobtained a specific assessment of need,'' Runkel said.   ``This $50 million was a response to that request by thedepartment to go after fraudulent activity,'' Runkel said.   Runkel estimated that about 200 cases of savings-and-loan fraudeither are being investigated by the Justice Department or have beenreported to federal authorities. These include cases ``where we havesome suspicion or we have reason to believe'' that fraud occurred,he said.   Runkel declined to say how many of the 200 cases are under activeinvestigation.   The special team envisioned by Bush would absorb two separate Sandamp;Lfraud units that have investigated alleged wrongdoing by thriftindustry officials in Texas and Oklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
