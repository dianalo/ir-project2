The other plaintiffs in the suit are former PepperellChairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. and an investment partnershipknown as Grace Brothers Ltd.</LP><TEXT>   In 1989, the Chicago investor acquired 95% of the textilecompany through a $58-a-share tender offer that valued theGeorgia concern at $1.56 billion, but he ran into moneyproblems before he could buy up the remaining 5%.   Together, the three plaintiffs hold about 245,000 of theindicated approximately 1.5 million Pepperell shares still inpublic hands. Those remaining shares continue to tradepublicly, albeit at a heavily discounted price in the low$30s.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Pepperell closed at $35, up $1.75.   Among other things, Kidder and the others are seeking toblock an earlier-announced debt-for-equity swap, under whichMr. Farley has agreed to hand over the bulk of his Pepperellholdings to creditors who funded his takeover.   The lawsuit, filed in Troup County, Ga., state court, alsoasks for undetermined compensatory damages, and $10 millionin punitive damages.   Mr. Farley couldn't be reached for comment.   The Kidder/Lanier lawsuit outlines the disastrous chain ofevents that followed Mr. Farley's victory in the protractedand bitter fight for control of Pepperell, during the lastdays of the 1980s takeover boom.   Mr. Farley's woes stem, to a large extent, from thecollapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which helped financemost of his acquisitions.   Under terms of the definitive agreement to which Pepperellmanagement finally acceded, the suit says, Mr. Farley wasspecifically obliged to purchase at $58 apiece &quot;any and all&quot;Pepperell shares that weren't tendered.   Such arrangements aren't unusual; in many offers, a smallpercentage of holders fail, for whatever reason, to tendertheir shares. Those leftover holdings are typically scoopedup at the same price through a so-called &quot;short-form&quot;maneuver, once the buyer has a controlling stake.   Mr. Farley had the help of a &quot;highly confident&quot; letterfrom Drexel, promising to place $1.7 billion in &quot;mezzaninefinancing,&quot; the suit claims. That junk-bond financing was toreplace a $1.4 billion bridge loan provided by bank lenders.   But because the junk-bond market was turning sour --mainly because of Drexel's increasing difficulties -- Mr.Farley couldn't place the junk to pay off the bridge loan.   He also couldn't raise the additional -- about $80 millionto cash out the untendered shares. And until he did so, termsof the merger agreement prohibited him from any access toWest Point's cash flow.   Under those constraints, the acquisition vehicle in March1990 went into default to senior lenders and bondholders. InAugust 1991, Mr. Farley agreed to cede almost all of theacquisition vehicle, and the 95% Pepperell stake it holds, tothe creditors.   That arrangement, the Kidder/Lanier suit asserts, meansPepperell's &quot;minority shareholders will be left holding theirWPP stock with no opportunity to receive the contractualprice.&quot; The implication is that the minority holders will befrozen out, with the money instead used to repay some of thestill-unpaid acquisition debt.   The minority holders' position &quot;has been eroded evenfurther,&quot; the suit alleges, &quot;through certain preferentialpayments&quot; that Pepperell has agreed to make to theacquisition vehicle and affiliated Farley interests. Thoseinclude certain &quot;tax-sharing&quot; payments to which the minorityholders take exception. They object as well to a July 1991pact that calls for the investment vehicle -- which is notyet controlled by lenders -- to pay Mr. Farley and affiliates$5 million annually through June 1994, for &quot;managementservices.&quot;   Such an arrangement, the suit maintains, constitutes&quot;unlawful discrimination among shareholders.&quot;   Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., said it owns167,000 Pepperell shares. While the suit doesn't say how thecompany happened to own the untendered shares, and a Kidderofficial declined to comment, the most likely explanationappears that the securities firm acquired the stock at adiscount after the tender offer had expired, in expectationof a profit when the final cash-out took place.   Mr. Lanier, the suit says, owns nearly 23,000 shares,while Grace Brothers owns 55,500 Pepperell shares.</TEXT></DOC>
