Perhaps you should have considered that fast-movingand judgmental executives like yourself may need to becomplemented by people who explore ideas more deeply beforerendering judgment.   One tool that I have used to make sure I don't make thesame mistake is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), ameans of identifying patterns of human behavior. Insightsprovided by the MBTI are so extraordinarily useful that thetest should be routinely administered to adults as they enterthe workplace, to parents raising children, and to youngadults thinking about getting married.</LP><TEXT>   The MBTI was designed by Isabel Myers and her mother,Katharine Briggs, in the 1950s and owes a nod to the Jungiantheory of psychological types. It has been used extensivelyby psychologists and consultants, and books about it -- suchas &quot;Please Understand Me&quot; (Prometheus, 1984) by David Keirseyand Marilyn Bates -- are widely available. The MBTI isup-to-date. Just recently a new expert systems program calledNegotiator Pro came on the market. Meant to hone negotiatingskills, one program component of the software package asksthe user to judge the personalities of everyone involved inthe negotiation based on the MBTI.   So how does the MBTI work? It identifies 16 differentpatterns of action, based on four pairs of characteristics.The four characteristics are as follows:                                                                                                          Extraversion vs. Introversion: The person who selectspeople as a source of energy usually tends towardextraversion while the person who chooses solitude to gainenergy probably tends toward introversion. Extraversion ischaracterized by E and introversion by I.                                                                                                          Intuition vs. Sensation: A person who has a preference forsensation probably describes himself or herself as practicaland factual, S. Someone who has a natural preference forintuition probably would be described as innovative andfacile with ideas, N.                                                                                                          Thinking vs. Feeling: Those who choose the logical basisof choice are called Thinkers, T, and those who choose thepersonal basis are Feelers, F.                                                                                                          Judging vs. Perceiving: Those who prefer closure over openoptions are judging types, J, while those who prefer to keepthings open as they consider additional options areperceivers, P.                                                                                                          You need only answer the 96 indicator questions and youwill have your type. Here is the full list of types, andshort labels given by Keirsey and Bates:                                                                                                          INTP (Architect)             ESFJ (Seller)   ENTP (Inventor)              ISFJ (Conservator)   INTJ (Scientist)             ESFP (Entertainer)   ENTJ (Fieldmarshal)          ISFP (Artist)   INFP (Questor)               ESTJ (Administrator)   ENFP (Journalist)            ISTJ (Trustee)   INFJ (Author)                ESTP (Promotior)   ENFJ (Pedagogue)             ISTP (Artisan)                                                                                                          For the sake of brevity, let's look at just half of thesetypes, their labels, and some attributes that Mr. Keirsey andMs. Bates give them.                                                                                                          Pedagogue -- ENFJ. These are outstanding leaders ofgroups. They often have charisma. They have the charmingcharacteristic of appearing to take for granted that theywill have a following. They place value on cooperation fromothers and are willing to cooperate themselves.                                                                                                          Author -- INFJ. This person focuses on possibilities,thinks in terms of values, and comes easily to decisions.INFJs have a strong drive to help others and genuinely enjoyassisting their fellow men. They have depth of personality,are complicated, and understand complexity.                                                                                                          Journalist -- ENFP. This type has an uncanny sense of themotivation of others, which gives ENFPs a talent for seeinglife as exciting drama, full of possibilities for both goodand evil.                                                                                                          Questor -- INFP. The questor presents a calm face to theworld. Although questors demonstrate a cool reserve towardothers, inside they have a capacity for caring that is notalways found in other types. This type is idealistic and isfound in only 1% of the population.                                                                                                          Fieldmarshal -- ENTJ. The fieldmarshal needs to lead.ENTJs have a strong urge to give structure wherever they areand to assign people to long-range goals. These people searchmore for policy and goals than for regulations andprocedures. This type rejects inefficiency, and errorrepetition causes them to be impatient.                                                                                                          Scientist -- INTJ. This is the most confident of alltypes, having self-power awareness. The scientist focuses onpossibilities, using thinking in the form of empirical logic.INTJs look to the future rather than to the past. This typedoesn't often succumb to the magic of slogans. Authoritydoesn't impress the INTJ.                                                                                                          Inventor -- ENTP. The inventors wish to exercise theiringenuity in the world of people and things. They dealimaginatively with social relationships. They are good atfunctional analysis and have both a tolerance for andenjoyment of the complex. They are delighted by many thingsand are easy to please. They look for better ways to dothings.                                                                                                          Architect -- INTP. This type exhibits the greatestprecision in thought and language of all the types. INTPs,who make up only 1% of the population, detect contradictionsin statements no matter how distant in space or time thecontradictions were produced. INTPs can become obsessed withanalysis, and can be intellectual snobs.                                                                                                          The MBTI has been well documented over a 40-year period.Since it describes preferences rather than skills orabilities, it says that all preferences are equallyimportant.   Had I known the MBTI as I built teams of people to solvebusiness problems, it would have enhanced clarity andsmoothed working relations. The MBTI, while no panacea, issimple and inexpensive to administer, and it opens one's eyesto the richness and variety of people around us. And as anENTJ, a type associated with military officers (I'm a retiredArmy colonel) and corporate executives, I'd recommendimmediate implementation of the MBTI.   ---   Mr. Auerbach, an attorney, is president andamp; CEO of atechnology company.</TEXT></DOC>
