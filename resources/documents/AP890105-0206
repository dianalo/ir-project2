Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform approved last yearby the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, the election March 26 willchoose the 2,250 members of the new Congress of People's Deputies.   The ruling 13-member party Politburo on Thursday said thepolicy-making Central Committee of about 300 members will meetTuesday to list the party nominations, according to the nightly TVnews program ``Vremya'' and the official Tass news agency.   The Politburo said it received recommendations for candidatesfrom individual party members and local party organizations as wellas the Communist parties of the 15 Soviet republics. The campaignbegan Dec. 26.   A third of the Congress members will be elected from geographicaldistricts formed on the basis of equal population. Another thirdwill be chosen from districts based on their ethnic group. The finalthird will be chosen from the Communist Party, Young CommunistLeague, trade unions, and other social and professionalorganizations.   Under the law the Communist Party is entitled to 100 deputies.   The Communist Party still is enshrined in the Soviet Constitutionas the guiding force of Soviet society, and the law specificallyprohibits candidates from advocating any unconstitutional action.   The Congress, in turn, will choose the president and a smaller,more active Supreme Soviet.   Tass also reported that Sakharov, dean of the Soviet dissidentmovement and the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was nominated forthe Congress of People's Deputies by Leningrad's Ivan PavlovInstitute of Physiology.   It was at least the second institute under the Soviet Academy ofSciences to put Sakharov's name forward as a candidate.   Officials said last week that Sakharov also had been nominated bythe academy's Institute of the World Economy. Both nominations willbe forwarded to the academy at large for consideration.   The country's scientific workers, under the new law, can elect 75members of the Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
