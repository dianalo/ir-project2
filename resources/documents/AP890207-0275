Details on the walkout were sketchy. Two Machinists sources whospoke on condition of anonymity said the walkout was prompted by thebelief that workers were forced to work overtime. Some union membershave drawn five-day suspensions in recent days, the sources said,for refusing to work extra hours.   The Machinists and Eastern are locked in a contract dispute thatcould determine the future of the loss-plagued airline, a subsidiaryof Texas Air Corp. of Houston.   Eastern said the walkout had little effect on Eastern'soperations.   ``The flights at the terminal have been covered by managementpersonnel with no significant disruption,'' Eastern spokesman RobinMatell said. He added that there had been ``some delays up to about15 minutes.''   Matell said the workers who walked out would be ``disciplined inthe normal course and the normal manner.'' He declined to elaborate.   Cori Zywotow, another Eastern spokeswoman, said no other airportswere affected.   She said management would meet with Machinists officialsWednesday for ``a continuation of a meeting held (Tuesday) todiscuss disciplinary action that was taken over the weekend onemployees who refused to work overtime as provided in the contract.''   Union sources said the midafternoon walkout wasn't called byunion leadership. They said the walkout began with baggage handlersand was joined by other union members. Estimates of thoseparticipating ranged to 1,000.   After declaring an impasse last week, the National MediationBoard set a 30-day cooling-off period ending March 3 in the Easterncontract dispute with the Machinists. The union cannot strike beforethen.   If no settlement is reached by then, Eastern's largest unioncould strike the Miami-based carrier and the company could imposeits last contract offer, calling for $150 million in wage cuts.   Some of the largest cuts have been directed toward union baggagehandlers, whose average earnings last year were in the mid-$30,000range.   Machinists locals around the country began this week voting onwhether to authorize a strike if the March 3 deadline passes. Unionofficials expect overwhelming support for strike authorization.   Mechanics make up about half of the 8,500-member union,comprising more than one-fourth of all Eastern employees, while theother members are baggage handlers, ramp agents and other groundservices workers.</TEXT></DOC>
