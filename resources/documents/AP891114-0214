A bird as big andvulnerable to habitat loss and poaching as the bald eagle deservesconstant attention, and we would rather err on the side ofcaution,'' says M. Rupert Cutler, president of Defenders ofWildlife.   ``Although DDT is behind us, there are new chemicals beinginvented every day,'' he says. ``In addition, we see rapidpopulation growth, urbanization, the loss of wetlands and the lossof old growth forest trees in which the eagles nest, and there's noreason for optimism as far as eagle habitat protection isconcerned.''   Jim Pissot, who specializes in endangered species for theNational Audubon Society in Washington, says he is excited by theidea that eagles may have recovered sufficiently to warrantchanging their status.   But, like Cutler, he worries their habitat will be whittled awaylittle by little by a country eager to clear forests, drainwetlands and build roads.   ``Without strong federal oversight, we could be picking away attheir habitats _ a nest tree there, some roosting areas someplaceelse _ and we could be in the position we were in 40 years ago,''he says.   ``Even with the bird listed as endangered, there still is thepossibility that habitat will be lost. But as the bird isdown-listed to `threatened,' that door opens wider, and if it'staken off the list entirely, that door opens very wide.''   Regardless of the federal government's decision, Pennsylvaniawildlife officials plan to maintain strict vigils over the state'sbrood.   In Conneaut Marsh, for instance, birdwatchers are allowed nocloser than a half-mile from the eagles' nest, or aerie, whilemotorists driving through nearby Erie National Wildlife Refuge arenot permitted to stop or park on a section of roadway near anothernest.   ``They are so fragile,'' says Brenda Peebles, who monitors the10 Crawford County eagles for the Pennsylvania Game Commission.``They don't like people. They don't like to be disturbed. If theyhave eggs and you come near them, they're likely to abandon theireggs.''   A powerful predator, the bald eagle is happiest, ironically,when it doesn't have to kill what it eats and can pick at theremains of dead fish and wounded ducks left behind by otherpredators.   ``Eagles are thieves and robbers,'' says Scott Wood, anornithologist with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History inPittsburgh. ``The osprey will catch the fish and the eagles willsteal it from them.''   Bob Faber, a free-lance naturalist from Hiram, Ohio, whoconducts tours of Conneaut Marsh, chuckles, ``It doesn't make for agood image of the country.''   Nevertheless, Americans are fascinated with the elusive,solitary bird.   A group of 40 Pittsburgh-area residents recently drove two hoursand paddled canoes for several miles just to catch a glimpse _through binoculars _ of the snowy white head of an eagle perched ina 7-foot-deep nest high atop a dead tree in Conneaut Marsh.   The marsh was alive with snipe, warblers, Canada geese, carpdoing belly-flops. But it was the pair of eagles, either surveyingtheir watery world from the nest or soaring silently over treetops,that captured everyone's attention.   ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world,'' said BettyAbernathy, 78, of Pittsburgh, who has traveled several continentsto watch birds.   Gay Kalisz, 43, of McDonald, added: ``It's not like a walk inthe woods. It was wonderful to see this after knowing of theslaughter they've gone through.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
