Seeking to dispel any notion of a U.S.-Saudi rift, the embassyreleased a statement on the Saudi decision to buy $17 billion worthof military equipment, including 50 Tornado jet fighters, fromBritain.   ``The kingdom would like to reiterate its desire to obtain itsmilitary requirements, including advanced aircraft and defensearms, from American plants, with the full conviction of ourpeaceful intentions..,'' the statement said. It was attributed toan unnamed source who was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency.   The State Department has complained that the deal was not in theinterest of the United States.   For decades the Saudis relied mainly on the United States tosupply weapons, but supporters of Israel in Washington have blockedthe sale of some sophisticated weapons, claiming they could be usedagainst the Jewish state.   The statement said the British sale ``will not affect, either inthe short-term or long-term the strength of ties between''Washington and Riyadh.   Although the Saudis will continue trying to secure weapons fromthe United States, they will buy from any country as long as thereare no restrictions, the statement said.   Last week, King Fahd said Saudi Arabia will not hesitate topurchase weapons from communist suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
