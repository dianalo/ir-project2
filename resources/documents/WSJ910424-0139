Or,   -- Reduce the use of dangerous chemicals in the workplace,driving up costs and creating an international competitivedisadvantage. The high court overturned a federal appealscourt by ruling businesses may not bar women capable ofbearing children from certain jobs that might hurt theirfetuses. Fetal-protection policies are believed to be inplace in at least 15 major corporations as well as manysmaller concerns. Among those with the policies: GeneralMotors Corp., Du Pont Co., Olin Corp., Monsanto Corp. andB.F. Goodrich Co.</LP><TEXT>   The decision will &quot;make it harder for companies to produceproducts safely and efficiently,&quot; said Quentin Riegel, deputygeneral counsel for the National Association ofManufacturers. The court's action raises &quot;a tough policyissue that Congress will have to address soon,&quot; he added.   The ban on fetal-protection policies could also have wideramifications for women workers. When the appeals courtupheld Johnson Controls Inc.'s policy, a dissenting judgesaid the decision had the potential effect of excluding womenfrom 20 million industrial jobs involving substances posingfetal risks. The high court's reversal removes employers'&quot;justification for taking very lucrative jobs from women,&quot;said Anne Vladeck, a plaintiff's attorney in New York whospecializes in sex-bias cases. &quot;I think the Supreme Court isabsolutely right. It's not up to the employer to bepaternalistic. It's up to the parent.&quot;   In the court case, the United Auto Workers union suedMilwaukee-based Johnson Controls for barring women fromholding jobs at 15 car battery plants where the leadconcentration in their blood could be above safe levels --unless a woman could medically document her infertility.   The court decision will clearly force companies to droptheir fetal-protection requirements. Johnson Controls said itwill consider reviving a voluntary policy that was in effectbetween 1975 and 1982. That policy permitted women to switchto jobs that were less hazardous to fetuses.   Similarly, the Supreme Court's ruling may mean Du Pont&quot;will give {women} the final decision&quot; about whether theytake assignments potentially harmful to their unborn children&quot;rather than exercising that decision ourselves,&quot; said BruceW. Karrh, the chemical concern's vice president for safety,health and environmental affairs.   Du Pont transfers women of childbearing age to lesshazardous posts only when management can't achieve safeexposure levels by using engineering controls and personalsafety gear. The policy affects roughly 100 of Du Pont's140,000 employees world-wide who work with lead and two otherchemicals. The company created the rule in the mid-1970sbecause &quot;many times, the mother doesn't know she is carryingthe fetus until the {dangerous} exposure has occurred,&quot; Mr.Karrh said.   The Johnson Controls decision leaves employers withanother clear mandate, legal authorities said. Bosses willhave to go the extra mile in informing and warning womenworkers about fetal health risks on the job. Some may evenurge women to consult their physicians before starting suchassignments.   In addition, &quot;I think you'll probably start seeingattempts by employers to get some sort of waivers orreleases&quot; from legal liability when women take thesepositions, said Roger Kaplan, a partner at Jackson, Lewis,Schnitzler andamp; Krupman, a management law firm in New York. Mr.Kaplan thinks such waivers should say the employeeunderstands the hazards and agrees to assume fullresponsibility for any possible ill effects from the work.   A number of employers, including GM, Olin and Goodrich,declined comment on how they plan to proceed until they canassess the decision's impact. Nevertheless, it's clear thatbusinesses may have trouble defending themselves againstpersonal-injury lawsuits by damaged children.Fetal-protection policies arose largely because employersfeared being held liable if a woman worker exposed to adangerous substance had a baby with a birth defect.   Giving these workers additional information and warningswon't end a child's right to sue. &quot;You can talk at someone'swomb all you want but the fetus probably doesn't understandLatin yet,&quot; said Jordan Rossen, the UAW's general counsel.   Members of the Supreme Court, in their ruling, disagreed&quot;on the likelihood of employers being able to defendthemselves against such suits,&quot; noted Mark Dichter, a partnerwith Morgan Lewis andamp; Bockius, a management law firm based inPhiladelphia. The decision &quot;puts employers at risk.&quot;   Businesses may have to press states for legislative reliefso that damaged fetuses can't sue them later, Mr. Dichteradded. Concurred Mr. Riegel of the manufacturers'association: &quot;Congress should recognize that the safety ofchildren is as much a concern of employers as safety forother third parties such as customers.&quot;   Union lawyers and women's rights advocates believe itmakes more sense for companies to reduce all employees'exposure to hazardous substances. &quot;We hope {the ruling} willencourage employers to make the workplace safer&quot; by usingless lead, for example, or finding substitute productionmethods, said the auto workers' Mr. Rossen.   That may be easier said than done. Substitute chemicalscan cost a lot more -- or not exist. In addition, employersdon't always know how to increase safety. Du Pont, forinstance, invokes its fetal-protection policy for substancesfor which its scientists haven't figured out a safefetal-exposure level. The Supreme Court, by outlawing suchexclusionary policies, &quot;lays down a challenge that we have towork toward,&quot; said Du Pont's Mr. Karrh.
