It does not. It comes from thousands of men and women who,equipped with strong resources and sophisticated technology,are committed to delivering critical, nondiscretionaryservices in the best possible way. While your articleemphasized that we have a legal staff of about 80 people anda group lobbying for effective environmental regulations, itfailed to note we have a much larger group -- more than threetimes larger -- in our environmental management department.We employ more than 2,500 engineers, scientists andtechnicians to develop and monitor company facilities.</LP><TEXT>   Our facilities are the best in our industry, and are not&quot;dumps,&quot; as your article described. Recently, our landfillswon 10 out of 17 awards conferred by a national associationof governmental environmental officials, the GovernmentalRefuse Collection and Disposal Association.   The article chose to include comments from twoenvironmental groups, Citizens ClearingHouse for HazardousWaste and Greenpeace, which have targeted our companyrepeatedly in efforts to prevent the siting of neededdisposal facilities.   The task of managing the 180 million tons of municipalwaste and 260 million tons of hazardous waste generated inthe U.S. each year is a large one. Waste-disposal servicesand technologies, while not always welcome, are necessary. Itis a fact of life. We offer these services responsibly andhave made strong contributions to improving them wherever weoperate.   Harold Gershowitz   Senior Vice President   Waste Management Inc.
