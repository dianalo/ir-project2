(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 8,000 people staged an anti-abortionrally at the New Jersey Statehouse on Sunday, cheering a litany ofspeakers who warned lawmakers that the ``silent majority'' opposesabortion.   Thousands marched, chanted, prayed and sang as leaders urgedthem to push for changes in the laws that legalized abortion.   The throng was opposed by about 35 members of the NationalOrganization for Women, who held a silent counter-demonstrationbehind a row of state police troopers. Police said there were noincidents reported at the rally.   Supports of abortion rights have a Statehouse rally set for Oct.15.   The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to allow state lawmakersto restrict abortions has focused attention on the issue in NewJersey and Virginia, the two states with gubernatorial electionsthis year.   Organizers of the rally, who are lobbying for an amendment tothe state Constitution to allow such restrictions, said they wantpoliticians to understand that voters are in their corner.   ``There's a sleeping giant out there and it's about to awaken,''said Kay Krug, president of Citizens Concerned for Life. ``It'scalled the pro-life movement in New Jersey. Trenton, we're going toamend the constitution and save babies in New Jersey.''   Although about two dozen speakers urged the crowd to becomeinvolved in the anti-abortion movement, few spoke specificallyabout political candidates.   The Republican candidate for governor, James Courter, a longtimeadvocate of the anti-abortion movement, said during the Republicangubernatorial primary he would sign a bill to restrict abortions.Later, however, he said he would not impose his personal views onthe women of New Jersey.   Democratic candidate James Florio says he favors a woman's rightto choose and would not sign any bill to restrict abortions in NewJersey.</TEXT></DOC>
