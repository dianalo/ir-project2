Over the past five years we have developed approaches in thedesign of certain numerical algorithms that allow both efficient andportability. Our current efforts emphasize three areas: environmentsfor algorithm development, parallel programming methodologies, and advancedalgorithm development. 9 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
