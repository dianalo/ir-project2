(FDC)FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   We read with interest your editorial challenging themotives and merits of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation and Resolution Trust Corporation's claims againstformer Drexel official Michael Milken and others for lossessuffered by savings and loan associations in junk bonds(&quot;Credit Crunching Lawsuits,&quot; Oct. 1).   As general counsel of the FDIC, I believe it is importantto address certain of the misunderstandings set forth in theeditorial.</LP><TEXT>   Contrary to the implications of the editorial and Mr.Milken's PR campaign, the FDIC and RTC lawsuits do not assertor even suggest that junk bonds sold by Drexel or other firms&quot;caused the Sandamp;L crisis.&quot; Our lawsuits legitimately seek torecover for American taxpayers losses suffered by more than40 failed Sandamp;Ls from junk-bond purchases tied to illegalactivities by Mr. Milken and his associates. Our claimsassert that the Milken group derived billions of dollars inprofits from illegal schemes that included marketmanipulation, threats, bribes, obstruction of justice andfraudulent misrepresentations about the value and liquidityof junk bonds sold. The FDIC and RTC litigation is expectedto recover a portion of the U.S. taxpayers' losses at thosefederally insured Sandamp;Ls.   As for suggestions that the FDIC and RTC unfairly singledout Drexel and Mr. Milken from other investment banks thatmarketed junk bonds, it is important to note that no otherinvestment banks or their senior officials have pleadedguilty to manipulative practices or paid enormous fines ashave Drexel and Mr. Milken.   The civil lawsuits brought against Mr. Milken and othersby the FDIC and RTC are not the same as the various criminaland enforcement proceedings against Mr. Milken by the JusticeDepartment and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thefact that these other proceedings have been resolved doesnot, and should not, preclude the FDIC and RTC fromfulfilling their statutory and fiduciary responsibilities.When acting as conservator or receiver for failedinstitutions, the FDIC and RTC are required by law tomaximize recoveries from wrongdoers and thereby minimizecosts to the American taxpayer.   Your editorial seeks to link the country's currenteconomic situation with our agencies' lawsuits pendingagainst Mr. Milken and his associates. Contrary to yoursuggestion, the FDIC and RTC lawsuits reflect no attempt tosend &quot;the chilling message that anyone who takes risks inthis marketplace can lose more than money,&quot; or to suppressinnovative or job-creating financial instruments or productsfor the capital markets. Instead, we are attempting to ensurethat the risk-takers don't gamble with federally insureddeposits, and that financial and capital markets function asthey were intended -- free of fraud and manipulation.
