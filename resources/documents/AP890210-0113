ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald H. Brown was elected today chairman ofthe Democratic Party, the first black to head a major politicalparty, and said his chairmanship ``won't be about race, it will beabout the races we win.''   ``You have made history,'' he told the Democratic NationalCommittee moments after it elected him chairman by acclamation.   A former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and adviser toJesse Jackson, Brown was unopposed for the party chairmanship.   Four other contenders to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr. in the topparty post dropped out early in the contest.   ``There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the historyof this moment,'' he said. ``Let me speak frankly,'' he went on, ``Idid not run on the basis of race but I will not run away from it.   ``I am proud of who I am. And I am proud of this party, for weare truly America's last, best hope to bridge the divisions of race,region, religion, and ethnicity.''   Brown said his first priority would be winning elections and ``Ipromise you: the story of my chairmanship won't be about race, itwill be about the races we win over the next four years.''   He is stepping in as chairman of the Democratic Party with apledge to reach out to the moderates and conservatives who opposedhim because of his ties to Kennedy and Jackson.   As he made the rounds Thursday of meetings of party officials,Brown acknowledged that many Democrats had been reluctant to supporthis bid for the chairmanship.   It no longer mattered, he said, whether people were earlysupporters or late. ``Most of all we've got to be united as aparty.''   A 47-year-old partner in one of Washington's largest and mostpolitically active law firms _ Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow _ Brown wasdeputy manager of Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign and thenserved as general counsel and staff director of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee.   He was a top adviser to Jackson in the late stages of his 1988presidential campaign and was given credit for helping unify theparty at its Atlanta convention last summer.   Brown grew up in Harlem where his father was manager of theTheresa Hotel. But his parents, both graduates of Howard University,sent their only child to predominantly white schools on Manhattan'sUpper East Side.   That pattern continued into college, where Brown was the onlyblack in the class of 1962 at Middlebury College in Vermont.   ``I have maintained a significant interest in politics over theyears,'' Brown wrote in autobiographical notes for his 25th reunionyearbook at Middlebury.   His involvement with the liberal wing of his party was the focusof much of the opposition to Brown when he announced his bid for thechairmanship.   But once he clinched the job, even his most vocal opponentsrallied around the chairman-to-be.   ``I say let's give him a chance,'' said John Baker, chairman ofthe Alabama Democratic Party, who once threatened to boycott thenational party if Brown became chairman.   ``A lot of Democrats feel excluded, feel rejected,'' said Baker.``They feel there's no room in the party for them because they aremoderate or conservative in philosophy.''   The Alabama chairman said it would be ``helpful, first of all, ifhe'd acknowledge that we've got that problem.''   Brown did just that.   ``The South is crucial to the future of the Democratic Party,''Brown told a meeting of the Southern Caucus of the DemocraticNational Committee.   ``I don't want to be the chairman of a party that writes off anyregion of the country,'' he said to Democrats aware theirpresidential candidates have received none of the South's electoralvotes in the last two elections.   Brown urged Democrats to ``speak forcefully'' on defense, crimeand drugs, issues he said are in the forefront of voter concerns.</TEXT></DOC>
