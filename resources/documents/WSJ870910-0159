Cambridge said that it also signed an agreement under which Agouron, a La Jolla, Calif., drug company, will have the right to sell drugs developed in the joint effort and Cambridge will have the right to sell vaccines and diagnostics.    William Haseltine, a scientist at Harvard University and Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, also is part of the group researching acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    In research on the virus that causes AIDS, Cambridge, a biotechnology concern, will use genetic-engineering technology to make proteins known to be essential to the virus. Agouron then will analyze the proteins with X-ray crystallography, a technique that enables scientists to visualize the detailed, three-dimensional structure of molecules.    Using computer-aided simulation of the proteins' structures, Agouron may be able to devise drugs to render the proteins inactive and to kill the virus, Cambridge said. The same strategy also may lead to improved diagnostics and vaccines.    As previously reported, Cambridge recently signed another collaboration agreement with Institut Merieux, a French vaccine manufacturer, for joint research on potential AIDS vaccines. </TEXT></DOC>
