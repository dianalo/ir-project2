Why waitaround for fussy fiction writers to make up stuff? You can performthe news tonight!   Except for being scooped by ABC News' apparently inadvertentattempt at an Emmy nomination for best 10-second drama, NBC Newswould have been the first network to leap into the questionablearena of news ``re-creations.'' Why let those sterling bastions ofjournalism like ``A Current Affair'' have all the fun?   At the outset of NBC's new prime-time news program ``Yesterday,Today and Tomorrow'' Wednesday night, co-anchor Mary Alice Williamspromised that the re-creations would faithfully reproduce theevents they portrayed and be clearly labeled.   As to the former, it's assumably true. As to the latter, 'fraidnot.   In a segment about ``DNA fingerprinting,'' co-anchor ChuckScarborough indeed announces that the crime in question is to bere-created, but as the segment drones on, it becomes confusing tothe viewer. Are the pictures of the woman with bruises on her armsfake, or real? Is the gruesome closeup of ``brain tissue'' in herabandoned car re-created? If so, why?   NBC News has gone over the line between news and entertainment,a line increasingly blurred in recent months by the proliferationof so-called ``tabloid TV'' shows that rely on often sensationaland melodramatic re-creations to compete for viewers.   While ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which preceded ``Yesterday, Todayand Tomorrow'' Wednesday night, states at its outset that it is nota news program, ``YTT'' declares proudly that it is. Occasionallythe two programs are disturbingly similar.   News re-creations have become the TV issue of the summer. CBS'revamped ``West 57th'' is reported to have re-creations in itsplan, but details of the show, which won't premiere until nextmonth, haven't been revealed.   The issue arose when ABC News re-created not an event, but analleged event, the handoff of a briefcase from an accused spy to aSoviet agent. Two ABC News staffers were the performers. In anearly feed of ``World News Tonight,'' the picture was not labeled a``simulation.'' In a later feed, it was. But ABC News PresidentRoone Arledge later said that the film of the ``actors'' was to beused as a model for a computer-generated sketch that would havebeen a graphic more than a simulation.   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' is getting a summer run as aseries of three specials. It does not have a regular time period onNBC's fall schedule.   ABC is premiering a new prime-time news show this week, too.``PrimeTime Live,'' with Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, premierestonight. It will not include re-creations.   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' set out to utilizere-creations and will no doubt be discussed largely in terms of thepropriety of network news engaging in re-creation of events.   Lost in all this is the substance of the program. Just as well.The premiere of ``YTT'' was indifferent. The crime segment, whichwas the only one that utilized re-creations, was hokey-looking atbest. Williams' segment on ``whatever happened to the Woodstockgeneration'' was vacuous.   The most compelling segment was Maria Shriver's segment,examining ``selective termination,'' a difficult decision faced byparents who resort to fertility drugs to conceive a child, and endup with multiple fetuses. In some cases, doctors tell them somemust be terminated if any are to survive. The Shriver segment wasno different from a segment on any newsmagazine _ no re-creations,just a compelling story.   During the opening of ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,''Scarborough announces that show hopes to be unique. What is thepoint of employing questionable practices for the sake of producinga program that is mediocre, but ``unique?'' Maybe NBC News shouldthink about getting back to basics instead.</TEXT></DOC>
