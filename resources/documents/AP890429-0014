A suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington said theEnergy Department should not be allowed to go ahead withpreparatory work planned for later this year until a fullerassessment is made of the plant's environmental impact.   The object of the suit is the Special Isotope Separation plant,which the Energy Department plans to build on federal land nearIdaho Falls. The facility would use a new technique to produceweapon-grade plutonium for nuclear weapons.   The parties to the suit _ the Natural Resources Defense Council,the Snake River Alliance and the Palouse-Clearwater Hanford Watch _contend the department also should be required to give furtherstudy to alternatives to building the plant.   ``DOE simply has not lived up to its obligation to look beforeit leaps into a potentially unnecessary and dangerous plant,'' saidDan W. Reicher, an attorney for Natural Resources.   A department spokesman, Will Callicott, said there would be noofficial comment on the suit.   The plant, to be built at the Idaho National EngineeringLaboratory by 1995, would use laser technologies to makeweapon-grade plutonium out of reactor-grade plutonium that isrecovered from commercial nuclear power plants, the suit alleges.   The technology is under development at the government's LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory in California.   Some private analysts of the government's nuclear weaponsprogram contend there is no demonstrated need for the Idahofacility because there already is more than enough plutonium tolast for the foreseeable future. The size of the nation's plutoniuminventories is classified.   ``In light of the plutonium surplus, SIS appears to be a $3billion pork-barrel project,'' Paul Leventhal, president of theNuclear Control Institute, said in a letter to congressionalleaders last month. He was referring to the estimated $1.2 billionconstruction cost and $1.9 billion operating cost.   The Energy Department, in a report earlier this year on plansfor modernizing its nuclear weapons complex, labeled the Idahoproject ``time-critical and essential'' and ranked it among its topdefense program priorities.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who is reassessing the Reaganadministration's long-range plans for the weapons program, has toldCongress he strongly supports building the Idaho plant.   ``The Special Isotope Separation facility in Idaho should beconstructed to provide flexibility and technological diversity to aproduction complex burdened by reactor operating constraints,'' hetold a House panel earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
