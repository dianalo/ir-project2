According to a detailed report by the department's EconomicResearch Service, the value of shipments in the 1989 fiscal yearwas almost $39.7 billion, up 12 percent from $35.3 billion in 1988.   That was the biggest export value since the record $43.8 billionin 1981. It also marked the third consecutive year-to-year increasesince exports plunged to $26.3 billion in 1986.   Officials said the 1989 export surge came despite a sharpcutback in the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP,which subsidizes selected exports to designated overseas markets.   Agricultural imports, meanwhile, were valued at a record $21.5billion, up from about $21 billion in 1988, the previous high.Vegetables, grain and grain products, sugar and rubber showed thelargest increases, the report said.   As expected, the actual volume of 1989 exports of keycommodities was down from the previous year. But higher ``unit''prices for many items offset the decline in shipment tonnages.   For example, total U.S. wheat exports dropped to 37.7 millionmetric tons from 40.5 million tons in 1988, despite huge shipmentsto the Soviet Union and China. The value, boosted by higher marketprices, rose to more than $6 billion from $4.5 billion in 1988.   Corn exports in 1989 jumped 15 percent from 1988 to 50.7 milliontons, the most in a year since 1981. That included a record 15.6million tons shipped to the Soviets. Total shipments were worth$6.1 billion, up from $4.32 billion in 1988.   Soybean exports in 1989 were reported at 14.1 million tons, downfrom 21.1 million tons in 1988, the lowest since 1975. The exportvalue, at $4.08 billion, was down from $5.07 billion.   Exports of cotton totaled 1.4 million tons, or 6.6 millionbales, the highest level in five years, the report said. Value,reflecting lower prices, dropped to $2.04 billion from $2.14billion in 1988.   The analysis also showed that spending for export subsidiesunder EEP dropped 15 percent in 1989 to less than $2.8 billion fromnearly $3.3 billion in 1988.   In terms of commodities, the EEP subsidies covered less than15.9 million tons of wheat, down almost 40 percent from 26.3million tons subsidized in 1988.   All commodities authorized under the program were cut back,according to the report. Others included:   _Rice, 20,000 tons in 1989, down 83 percent from 120,000 in 1988.   _Barley, 529,000 tons, down 69 percent from 1.7 million.   _Grain sorghum, none in 1989 and 213,000 tons in 1988.   _Vegetable oils, 105,000 tons, down 71 percent from 13,000.   _Frozen poultry, 8,000 tons, down 39 percent from 13,000.   _Eggs, 4.2 million dozen, down 61 percent from 10.75 million.   _Cattle, none, compared with 12,000 head in 1988.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Agriculture Department scientist hasdeveloped a sure-fire test to detect a costly virus in fruit treeseedlings.   Plant pathologist Ahmed F. Hadidi of the department'sAgricultural Research Service said the test detects the presence oftomato ringspot 100 percent of the time, compared with currentdiagnostic procedures that are only about 60 percent reliable.   The virus causes stem pitting disease of stone fruits likepeaches, and union necrosis disease of apples. These are among themost common diseases of commercial orchards on the East Coast, theagency said.   Each year the virus is responsible for millions of dollars inlosses of peach, nectarine, prune and apple trees, as well as heavydamage to grapes and raspberries.   ``In the past, it has been a difficult and sometimes impossiblevirus to diagnose in fruit crops,'' said Hadidi, who works at theagency's National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Laboratory inBeltsville, Md. ``Fruit trees can be infected with the virus for afew years before they exhibit symptoms of the disease, which arethen followed by the tree's decline and death.''   Hadidi said he expects that by the time it is marketed as acommercial kit it will be cheap enough to use for screening treesfor the virus. A patent application is being filed, a step towardcommercial development.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department has a newpublication for farmers, weather buffs and others who followtemperature and precipitation patterns.
