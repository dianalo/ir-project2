Interest-rate swaps, caps, collars and floors may be alien to average investors. The IRS, concerned about the tax treatment, isn't as chummy with them as it needs to be, either. So the chief counsel has formed a team to analyze these and other new financial products. It is working on rulings and guidance for taxpayers and invites comments addressed to: IRS Financial Products Group, Room 3042, 1111 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, D.C. 20224.    The IRS calls the above items &quot;notional principal contracts,&quot; used to hedge against interest-rate and currency fluctuations. The group also is eyeing hybrid securities mixing debt, equity, or option features; securities with variable or contingent interest, and other tax-planning devices used in finance, says Announcement 88-77. &quot;It's a positive development,&quot; says Randall Kau, a New York lawyer who has dealt with the IRS on behalf of some securities firms:   &quot;There are lots of issues that need clarifying because of the tremendous creativity of the industry and the growth of the markets.&quot;    HUSTLED AND HASSLED, he is bilked of an IRA and then must pay tax on it.    A chap we'll call Mark cashed out an individual retirement account in April 1987; he wrote a check for the full sum to a man posing as a certified financial planner for reinvesting in another account. Then in July, Mark found he'd been swindled. He recovered much of his cash, but the 60-day period for a tax-free rollover of funds from one IRA to another had run out. So he asked the IRS to let him treat his misguided payment to the con man as a timely rollover.    Sorry, says private ruling 8815036, Mark has been had all around. Under tax law, a transfer to an individual, not another IRA, isn't a rollover, and there are no waivers of the 60-day deadline. Further, reinvestment of the recovered funds in an IRA was too late to be a rollover. The result: The full amount that Mark withdrew from the original IRA is subject to income tax, plus the 10% penalty for premature withdrawal.    FIGHTING CRIME brings uncertain rewards to the IRS, a GAO study finds.    Half the IRS's criminal-investigation resources go into special-enforcement programs with other agencies to nab big organized-crime and drug figures for evading tax on illegal income. In fiscal 1985, the IRS completed 2,364 such investigations, Congress's audit arm, the General Accounting Office, says. Indictments and convictions have risen steadily. Of cases closed in 1985, 47% led to convictions; 68% of the convictions led to prison. But only 38% of those investigated were &quot;major criminals.&quot;    Data for fiscal 1982, the most recent, show such cases generated $11.2 million in tax revenue -- only $2.2 million of it from illicit income. Indeed, the GAO couldn't determine if results met Congress's or the IRS's desires, for specific goals haven't been set. And lacking data, the GAO didn't assess the program's value to other agencies. The GAO did make recommendations to improve operations. Among them:   Develop better management data and pursue the tax claims arising from criminal cases more actively.    ELECTRONIC FILERS sent in 582,790 personal returns over phone lines by April 22, up from 77,615 returns in 1987, the IRS reports. In 1989, it will expand electronic transmission of returns and refunds to 48 of its 63 districts from 16 this year. All other districts are to be added in 1990.    TAX-EXEMPT GROUPS at a hearing Monday before a House Ways and Means panel will sound off against several proposals to broaden the scope of taxes on income unrelated to their exempt aims. The Treasury also is expected to criticize some of the options being considered.    STUDYING IN HAWAII for a doctorate was a temporary, two-year interruption of Prof. Malia S. Johnson's employment by the University of Texas and didn't change her home for tax purposes, the Tax Court says. So she may deduct $4,200 in living costs incurred while she was away from home.    THE BIG FREEZE HEADS for schemes to profit from native Alaskans' losses.    Trust tax experts to brave the frozen frontier. The 1986 tax act limits corporations' ability to cut taxable income by buying concerns with net operating losses. But through 1991, Congress exempted from the rules the struggling concerns set up by the Alaska Natives Claims Settlement Act, expecting the aid to lose less than $50 million in tax revenue. The opening was irresistible. Other companies devised ways to gobble up Alaskan concerns' losses. Now House Ways and Means chief Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) has entered a bill to block such transfers after April 26.    &quot;Creative investment bankers&quot; and profitable companies showed Alaskan concerns how to generate artificial losses, Rostenkowski says, and &quot;apparently have caused a rush to create new and ever larger paper losses for sale.&quot; The schemes already may have cost six times the forecast tax loss, he adds, and could cost $200 million more if not thwarted by Congress.    The bill's effective date wouldn't keep the IRS from challenging earlier deals, the chairman notes.    BRIEFS: Alabama legislators overrode a veto and repealed the state's call for a federal constitutional convention to require a balanced budget. . . . New York state reports two &quot;firsts&quot; -- a felony conviction for evading income tax and fraud charges against an applicant for tax amnesty. </TEXT></DOC>
