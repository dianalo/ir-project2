The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.90 points to 2583.08. Trading was active, in contrast to the relatively sluggish mood in the bond and currency markets.    With no clear direction for the economy or for monetary policy to guide them, investors were hesitant to make any bold moves. This allowed program trading to dominate stock-market activity and put a damper on other financial markets.    After a round of computer-driven program trading sent the Dow Jones industrials up more than 18 points to 2603 at noon EDT, sell programs and profit-taking pulled prices down more than 31 points from that peak. Stocks recovered most of their losses by the close, however.    Some analysts speculated that investors are being torn between consumer-related stocks, which they perceive as safe in the event of a recession, and relatively low-priced cyclical stocks that could boom if the economy continues to grow.    But a key element in the possible resurgence of cyclical stocks is a further easing of credit by the Federal Reserve, and it isn't clear when that might happen. Some fixed-income traders suggest that with the federal funds rate -- the interest rate banks charge one another for short-term loans -- hovering around 9 1/8% the past two days, the Fed may already have eased slightly. Traders said that until Monday, the lower end of the range appeared to be 9 1/4%.    Other traders, however, are convinced the Fed wants more evidence of a slowing economy before it eases further. That might come next week in the government's employment report for July. If employment continues to grow at a sluggish pace and unemployment levels rise, the Fed might be more likely to ease further.    Yesterday's report on durable-goods orders didn't provide much help for uncertain investors. Orders in June were up 0.3%, about in line with expectations. But excluding defense-related goods, orders were off 0.7% after a revised decline of 4.3% in May. Analysts said these orders tend to be volatile because they reflect defense-related spending and orders for such major items as airplanes and locomotives, which can skew the monthly figures.    In major market activity:    Stock prices were off marginally. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 179.3 million shares. But advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners, 772-684.    Bond prices rose. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue gained about a quarter-point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield slid to 8.12%.    The dollar declined. In late New York trading, it was quoted at 1.8830 marks and 141.45 yen, compared with 1.8967 marks and 142.50 yen late Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
