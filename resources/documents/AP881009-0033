(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While Jim and Tammy Bakker have beenasking for money to regain control of PTL and set up a newtelevision ministry, federal agents have been keeping a close watchon their fund-raising tactics.   ``I imagine they're checking very carefully to see what he'sdoing,'' said Hendersonville lawyer Jim Toms, one of Bakker'sattorneys. He said federal authorities have questioned him aboutthe recent fund raising.   ``They're looking at it critically, but are keeping an openmind,'' Toms said. ``They're giving him room to see what he isreally going to do.''   The focus on the latest fund-raising effort comes in the midstof a 14-month-long federal grand jury investigation into possiblewrongdoing by the former PTL president and founder and his topaides.   Bakker won't disclose how much his latest efforts have raised.But Toms said he is keeping federal authorities posted on Bakker'sactivities and has offered to let Internal Revenue Service agentsinspect Bakker's financial records.   In a fund-raising campaign launched last month, the Bakkersmailed about 200,000 packets to potential donors across the nation.   Cards in the packets spell out their intentions: ``Your giftsare used to support Jim and Tammy and all their ministry. They havethe discretion to allocate your gift where needed. Jim and Tammyhave a nonprofit ministry, New Covenant Partners and Church, andare proceeding to apply for tax exemption, but your gift is not taxdeductible at this time.''   Charles Alexander, the Justice Department prosecutor heading thegrand jury investigation, declined to say if agents are askingabout the Bakkers' latest fund-raising techniques.   ``I have no comment at all,'' Alexander told The CharlotteObserver. ``I don't even acknowledge the existence of aninvestigation.''   Les Witmer, an IRS spokesman in Atlanta, said: ``Obviously,based on previous activities, the Internal Revenue Service would bevery interested in the fund-raising activities of the newcorporation.''   The IRS in April revoked PTL's tax-exempt status on the groundthat Bakker operated it mostly to make money _ not to minister.   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after admitting aone-time sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Three months later, PTL filed for reorganization under federalbankruptcy laws, and a bankruptcy judge has since ordered theministry to sell its assets _ the Heritage USA Christian retreatand theme park, the PTL satellite TV network and 1,700 undevelopedacres of land.   Bakker's bid to buy the assets fell through last month. Lastweek, Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman, won the bidding forPTL with an offer of $115 million.   Toms said contributions sent to help Bakker buy back PTL won'tbe used for anything else unless contributors give permission.   The Bakkers say they haven't given up on their dream to buy backPTL, but say they are soliciting contributions for a new televisionministry.   Donations will be used to pay Bakker as pastor of the NewCovenant Church.   ``Clearly, he will be paid as pastor,'' Toms said. ``and will beprovided with the normal ministerial allowances _ fortransportation and the like.''   But Toms said Bakker will not use donations to support theluxurious lifestyle he was accustomed to while president of PTL.   ``He isn't going to go out and pick up sticks for people to beathim with by buying something that people will criticize him for,''Toms said.   Bakker admits he made mistakes at PTL and says this time will bedifferent.   ``There will be strict financial controls,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
