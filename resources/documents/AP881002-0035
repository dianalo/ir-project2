Azim Nasser-zia said the takeover of Asmar was a strategicvictory for the rebels.   If true, it clears the route to northern Afghanistan fromPakistan, although guerrillas already made substantial inroads intothe north when the garrison of Barikot, about 20 miles north ofAsmar, fell earlier this year.   The guerrilla-supported Afghan News Agency said governmentsoldiers defending Asmar surrendered to the rebels over theweekend, but it gave no details. There was no comment from thegovernment on the guerrilla report.   Nasser-zia, who belongs to the moderate National Islamic Frontof Afghanistan, said rebels also have laid siege to the provincialcapital of Asadabad but are fighting heavy government defenses.   Guerrillas already tried and failed to take Asadabad in November.   The rebels are fighting the Marxist government in Kabul, whichis supported by Soviet troops that entered the country in 1979. TheSoviets began to withdraw their soldiers after signing an agreementin April in Geneva, and have pledged to pull out completely by May1989.</TEXT></DOC>
