Digital officials said the new VAX 6200 series is designed tocompete with IBM's existing 9370 and 4381 computers.   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the world's second-largestcomputer company and considered the industry leader inmid-performance range computers.   The announcement of the VAX 6200 series came one week afterDigital reported a 0.8 percent decrease in profits for the latestquarter while IBM announced a 16.3 percent rise, reversing atwo-year trend in the battle between the companies.   The new computers, which will cost between $131,600 and$653,200, will be available immediately, Digital said.   ``The new systems are positioned squarely in the middle of theVAX family and complement our current offerings,'' William R.Demmer, Digital's vice president of mid-range systems, said in astatement.   Digital introduced several mainframe computers in its VAX 8800series last month in a direct challenge to IBM. Last year thecompany unveiled its MicroVAX 3000 series designed for smalldepartments.   Analysts said the announcement was a strong tactical move forDigital because the company needed to upgrade its mid-range linebefore a rumored IBM development in the field.   ``It's a good move for DEC,'' said Bruce Watts of Needham andamp; Co.``It's partly intended to place them in a strongly competitiveposition when IBM announces its code-named Silverlake products thissummer.''   ``DEC is getting their products out into the market first inorder to prevent IBM from taking customers away,'' he said.   The company said the single-processor 6210 computer provides 2.8times the performance of its VAX 11@780 system. The system canaccommodate up to four processors at once.   Upgrades will cost betweem $100,200 and $173,500, Digital said.   Digital's earnings in its third fiscal quarter ending March 26totaled $305.1 million, or $2.33 a share, down from $307.6 million,or $2.29 a share, one year earlier.   The company had reduced its earnings estimates for the quarterbecause of sluggish sales of expensive computer systems and a shiftin demand to smaller lines.   Digital on Tuesday also announced a new version of its VMSsoftware and a new FORTRAN version for symmetric multiprocessing.   Meanwhile, IBM on Tuesday announced upgraded software to takeadvantage of design changes in its mainframe computers.</TEXT></DOC>
