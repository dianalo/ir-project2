In a 25-minute address on national radio and television hoursafter he returned from a three-day visit to Iran, Ceausescu made nomention of casualties in the west Romanian city of Timisoara.   Witnesses coming out of Romania have suggested that hundreds ofpeople were killed when security forces opened fire onanti-government protesters on Sunday. Reports today suggested theunrest had spread to other cities.   Ceausescu said the army had to restore order in Timisoara afterunrest was provoked by ``fascist, reactionary groups who wanted todestroy the independence and to stop the construction of socialismin Romania.''   The address, monitored by The Associated Press in Vienna, didnot say what steps would be taken to prevent continuing unrest.   Troops and police were reported patrolling Bucharest and otherRomanian cities today in an apparent attempt by the hard-lineCommunist authorities to stamp out any further protest.   About 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets today inTimisoara, 30 miles from the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders, theYugoslav news agency Tanjug said in a report from Bucharest quotingthe Yugoslav Consul in Timisoara.   Demonstrators reportedly passed the Yugoslav Consulate, chantingslogans against Ceausescu. The group passed Romanian army tanks,but soldiers watched without intervening, the Tanjug report said.   Ceausescu did not mention that reported protest, or unrest saidby Romanian emigres and other sources to have spread to othercities in the Balkan nation.   The 71-year-old Ceausescu, who has been in power 24 years and isthe longest-serving Soviet-bloc leader, refuses to adopt democraticreforms sweeping the East bloc.   He has forced hardships and rationing on his 23 millioncitizens, who have become increasingly dissatisfied with his harshrule as the once-rigid nations around them adopt reforms.   Tanjug quoted unofficial sources in Bucharest as saying that ``astate of full alert has been introduced across Romania as protestsand unrest continue in Timisoara and other towns.''   Witnesses have reported hundreds died during the recent unrest,but an Austrian traveler, Helmut Wolf, who returned from Timisoaratoday said the death toll in anti-government demonstrations was``more than 1,000.''   ``Sunday was brutal'' as security personnel fired into crowds ofcivilians in the city, Wolf said. Downtown Timisoara, a city of350,000, is in ruins, he told Austrian radio.   Late Tuesday, Tanjug quoted unidentified witnesses as saying upto 2,000 people may have been killed when security forces shot intothe crowd protesting the rigid policies of Ceausescu's Communistgovernment.   Mihai Munteanu, a member of the Soviet Parliament from theSoviet republic of Moldavia, said he spoke with acquaintances inRomania today and was told pro-democracy demonstrations were goingon in many cities.   In Iasi, people were burning books by Ceausescu, Munteanu said.Iasi is an industrial and university center 250 miles northeast ofBucharest, the capital. It is near the border with Moldavia.   There also have been unconfirmed reports of clashes in thecities of Arad, Brasov, Ploiesti, and Bucharest.   Timisoara was inaccessible to foreign travelers and telephonecallers today, according to Hungarians who tried to telephone andYugoslav border guards.   Tanjug said from Bucharest that foreign reporters who tried toreach the town were turned back.   Wolf, who returned to Vienna today after overseeing reliefshipments from Timisoara, told Austrian radio that houses in thecity center were on fire.   ``Tanks were everywhere,'' Wolf said in the interview.   A Yugoslav trucker who speaks Romanian said he saw graffiti onwalls while driving in a Timisoara suburb that called for ``anuprising by Romanians against the Ceausescu regime on Dec. 24.''   The trucker, who demanded anonymity, said he heard gunfire andsaw the sky being lit from the direction of Timisoara as he drovenear the city today.   A Hungarian radio reporter meeting people arriving fromBucharest today said the Romanian army has been mobilized and thaton Tuesday night reservists were called in.   In Bucharest, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy told TheAssociated Press that ``there is an increasing police and militarypresence in the streets of Bucharest. The streets are calm andquiet.''   A Hungarian who called Bucharest and four other major Romaniancities from Budapest today said he was told of a heavy military andpolice presence in the streets.   Guards at factories and offices have been doubled, according tohis informants and a brief report from Bucharest by the Soviet newsagency Tass.   The Hungarian reported that in Brasov, Romania's second-largestcity, helicopters were patrolling overhead in addition to theincreased security in the streets. Brasov was the scene ofRomania's last major anti-government demonstration, in November19todiscuss the operation and give his legal advice, Runkel said.   Runkel cited the ``inherent right of self-defense'' in Article51 of the United Nations Charter and the right of the U.S.government to protect its citizens, military installations andinstitutions under Article 21 of the Organization of AmericanStates treaty.   The Panama Canal Treaty also empowers the United States ``toprotect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations,''Runkel said.   The spokesman said that ``the democratically elected governmentof Panama was consulted prior to and welcomed the action taken bythe United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
