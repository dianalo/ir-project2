 Theresult, claims EDS, is the world's largest private digital telecommunicationsnetwork.andM;Logistically, EDSNET meshes data, voice and video communications into asingle network that spans five continents with multiple-transmission media,including copper cable, fiber optics, microwave and satellite.andP;  Systemcomponents include:andM;* 541 domestic and 100 international digital switches;andM;* 910 multiplexers;andM;* 264,811 telephones;andM;* 280,000 terminals and other data devices (estimated);andM;* 709 T1--1.544M bits per second (bps)--fiber-optic circuits comprising1,399,344 channel miles;andM;* 129 T3--45M bps--fiber-optic circuits comprising 3,817,632 channel miles;andM;* 98 X.25 packet assemblers/disassemblers;andM;* 21 microwave terminal and repeater sites;andM;* Leased transponder space on two satellites;andM;* 5,600 KU-Band (11 GHz to 14 GHz) television receive-only (TVRO) earthstations and 85 KU-Band two-way earth stations with plans for 242;andM;* 11 C-Band (4 GHz to 5 GHz) earth stations.andM;The 153,000-square-foot Information Management Center (IMC) at Plano sits atthe hub of the network.andP;  The IMC, which opened early last year, providesreal-time analysis and monitoring of EDSNET and coordinates the operations ofthe 15 North American and six international Information Processing Centers(IPCs) in all parts of the globe.andP;  IPCs perform data-processing for GM andother EDS customers.andM;Other EDSNET components include five Print Centers for handling bulk output,114 single-customer Data Centers under EDS operational control and a secondnetwork-management center for IMC backup.andM;Amdahl Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hitachi Data Systems (formerlyNational Advanced Systems Inc.) and IBM Corp. supply the majority of themainframe computers, terminals, data-storage devices and other equipment inthe IMC and IPCs.andP;  IBM's System Network Architecture protocol is usedthroughout EDSNET, across all media.andP;  Some data is also transported via theX.25 packet-switching protocol.andM;The basic elements of EDSNET and the telecommunications tasks the systemwould have to address had been evolving separately within EDS and GM overmany years.andM;In the early 1970s, for example, EDS was investing in intensive computingfacilities, called Regional Data Centers (RDCs).andP;  Customers could transmittheir work to the RDCs, which offered powerful data processing and storagecapabilities, secure handling of client information and skilled personnel.andM;At first, most communications were transmitted between each RDC and itscustomers.andP;  Inter-RDC traffic was relatively limited and took place overstandard long-distance trunk lines.andM;By 1983, EDS had interconnected and expanded its network of RDCs toaccommodate growth in federal and international markets, the acquisition ofOn Line Systems Inc. and the development of systems integration and systemsmanagement contracts, among other factor.andP;  EDS, then, was well-positioned toface a surge made on its network about to come from GM.andM;1.andP;  Lay the groundwork ...andM;Since the 1984 merger, EDS has taken steps to integrate GM's networks withits own.andP;  For example, all land-based voice and data communications withinand between the companies are channeled through a common set of digital-basedswitching nodes.andP;  This gives voice communications the speed and transmissionquality of broad data bandwidths and gives data communications theconnectivity and bandwidth-on-demand aspects of voice networks.andM;All data processing for GM and other EDS clients takes place in the IPCs.andO;&quot;The idea was to ultimately have two terrestrial paths for fiber optics andmicrowave, and one path for satellites, available for transmission from eachIPC,&quot; says Barry Ingram, vice president of EDS' Federal Government Group.andO;&quot;That way, enough redundancy would be built into the system so that failureat one site wouldn't knock out everything,&quot; he says.andM;Problems of incompatible network protocols between EDS and GM were few sinceboth companies were already committed to SNA.andP;  EDS, as was the case beforethe merger, could use protocol converters located at the IPCs to handleformat translation between SNA and data transmitted by its non-GM customersthat were using other standards.andP;  In many instances, even this would beunnecessary.andP;  Reason: EDS, itself, often determined incoming protocols byvirtue of the processing equipment it installed at customer sites.andM;EDS also wrote a common software interface, called Diamond, to translatebetween electronic-mail systems used by itself and GM.andP;  These systems includeE-mail from Computer Associates International Inc., used heavily by EDS,IBM's PROFS and the General Motors Electronic Mail System (GMEMS) in use atGM.andM;Additionally, EDS standardized purchasing for the system by documentingrequirements for vendors.andP;  The company then performed its own tests anddemonstrations to qualify products.andM;This process cut against the traditional independence of GM's divisions.andO;Keeping vendor rosters limited and under control, however, was seen by EDS asimportant in reducing the cost of systems implementation and training time.andM;2.andP;  Buy digital switches ...andM;&quot;Our first move was to install 541 digital switches around the country over atwo-year period,&quot; says Hartmut Burger, president of the TechnicalInfrastructure Services Division at EDS.andP;  &quot;This cost almost $500 million.&quot;andO;These switches serve as the digital end-points of voice and data circuitsconnected to them.andM;Switches used include ATandamp;T Co.'s #5ESS, System 75 and System 85; NorthernTelecom Inc.'s SL1 and SL100; and CBX from Rolm Siemens.andP;  &quot;These switcheswere chosen because they were among the earliest available digital switchesand because of such technical capabilities as remote software-modification,station message detail recording (SMDR) and alarming controls,&quot; says Burger.andO;These switches also offered migration potential into Integrated ServicesDigital Network (ISDN).andM;The switches were installed in a three-level hierarchical pattern.andP;  There are509 switches at Level Three, serving as the primary points of connection forincoming phone and data lines.andP;  These switches basically route calls alongpreassigned paths to Level Two devices and have limited networkingcapability.andM;Each of the 25 networking switches at Level Two consolidates communicationsfrom Level Three nodes.andP;  A Level Two switch may pass information from oneLevel Three switch to another, from a Level Three to a Level One switch andfrom one Level Two switch directly to another Level Two switch.andP;  The sevenLevel One nodes are interconnected by major backbone circuits of EDSNET.andO;These nodes determine the final path of long-distance phone calls.andP;  If theycannot establish a connection, calls are put on hold.andM;At the trunk site, the voice traffic of all switches is combined with datatraffic using time-division multiplexers from Avanti Communications Corp.,andO;General Datacomm Inc., Network Equipment Technologies and PhoenixMicrosystems Inc.andP;  Depending on total traffic volume, most switch locationsare interconnected by T1 or T3 circuits.andM;Case in point: T1 multiplexers can pull together 24 simultaneous voiceconversations into one channel.andP;  One voice circuit requires a digitalbandwidth of 64K bps, designated Digital Service, level 0 (DS-0).andO;Multiplexers for T3 circuits (DS-3) combine the equivalent of 28 T1s (672conversations running at 45M bps) into one channel.andP;  Most IPCs areinterconnected, at a minimum, by multiple T1 circuits and, in many cases, byone or more T3s.andM;EDS prefers fiber-optic lines for ground transmission in EDSNET, particularlybetween major nodes.andP;  Reason: &quot;Fiber is an extremely reliable and securemedium for the volume and speed of communications we need,&quot; says Burger.andO;&quot;Indeed, the installation of fiber gave us the capability of using largermultiplexed bandwidths.&quot;andM;EDS leases fiber-optic circuits from carriers such as ATandamp;T, LitelTelecommunications Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and U.S.andP;  SprintCommunications Co. for its wide-area transport requirements.andP;  For campusand/or metropolitan-area networks, EDS purchases fiber-optic cable andrelated equipment from companies like Harris Corp., Rockwell InternationalCorp. and Verilink Corp.andM;Concentrating network traffic into thick pipelines also yields economies ofscale for EDS and GM, especially at DS-3 bandwidths.andP;  For instance, accordingto Burger, if a DS-0 circuit cost $3 per-month-per-mile, then a leased DS-3circuit would give you the equivalent of a DS-0 channel for 30 centsper-month-per-mile.andP;  Transmitting both voice and data over the network alsoprovides more justification for the wider pipelines than does sending voiceor data alone.andM;3.andP;  Satellites for the world ...andM;The microwave component of EDSNET is relatively limited.andP;  The largest numberof installations is in Michigan: They handle the transmissions in an areathick with GM sites.andM;Some microwave equipment is also being put in at IPCs, and other locations,for backup purposes.andP;  The equivalent of traffic on 84 T1s can be sent frommicrowave terminal to microwave terminal.andP;  Microwave vendors in EDSNETinclude Harris, Rockwell, Avantek Inc., Digital Microwave Corp., M/A-COM MACInc. and NEC America Inc.andM;Microwave is a line-of-sight technology.andP;  Upshot: The number of terminals inuse depends on the terrain and, on occasion, intervening construction.andO;Repeaters are needed when the distance between one terminal and another istoo great to permit a single microwave shot.andM;&quot;The problem with microwave is that careful coordination of thelimited-available private-industry frequencies is required,&quot; says Ingram.andO;&quot;This is mandatory to avoid interferences.&quot;andM;Satellites and earth stations comprise the third leg of EDSNET.andP;  EDS does notown any satellites.andP;  Instead, it leases transponder space on the Galaxy IIand SBS4 satellites owned by Hughes Communications Inc.andM;Transponders are transmitters-receivers on a satellite that handle aspecified bandwidth and frequency range.andP;  Galaxy II, for instance, supplies24 transponders, each with a capacity of about 20 T1s.andP;  Leasing a transpondergives a company exclusive rights to use the set of frequencies carried bythat device.andM;Earth stations for EDSNET--including dishes, transceivers and systemmonitors--are purchased by EDS from different vendors.andP;  Dishes vary in sizeaccording to the transponder frequencies.andP;  For example, the relativelylow-frequency, 4-GHz-to-5-GHz C-Band channel requires large dishes that areeither 7 meters or 9.2 meters in diameter.andP;  Such dishes are generallyinstalled on the ground.andM;EDS uses its C-Band satellite connections to interconnect IPCs at T1 speeds.andO;Thus, &quot;Large volumes of information can be transmitted in short periods oftime,&quot; says Ingram.andP;  &quot;C-Band links are also dependable because of theirtransmission frequencies and installed dish size, which both make such linksrelatively insensitive to disturbances from weather and other sources ofinterference.&quot;andP;  Most C-Band earth stations in EDSNET are acquired fromVitalink Communications Corp.andM;The higher frequency, 11-GHz-to-14-GHz KU-Band can be used with smallerdishes, called Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs), that are 1 meter to 2meters in diameter.andP;  A VSAT, then, is more portable than a C-Band dish andalso is more sensitive to atmospheric disturbances.andP;  EDS has selected speedsof 128K bps and 512K bps for use with its VSATs.andM;&quot;KU-Band is optimally used when you want to send small amounts of informationat slower speeds,&quot; says Ingram.andP;  Hughes, Vitalink, Radiation Systems Inc. andScientific-Atlanta Inc. are among KU-Band earth-station vendors.andM;Satellite links play different roles within EDSNET, in addition to providingbackup for transmissions between major IPCs.andP;  They are key nodes in EDSNET'sinternational traffic.andP;  International communications between, say, the AuburnHills, Mich., IPC site and London or between Sacramento and Tokyo, take placeover Intelsat satellites.andP;  Leased terrestrial circuits are used to reachSouth America and Africa.andM;Also, satellites are used to transmit video broadcasts for training,videoconferences and internal corporate programs.andP;  EDS, for example, operatesthe GM dealer Automotive Satellite Television Network (ASTN) of more than2,000 KU-Band earth stations equipped only to receive video broadcasts.andP;  TheTV network sends out daily six hours of training, news and generalinformation over the SBS4 satellite to dealers and mechanics.andP;  EDS alsooperates similar video networks for more than 20 other U.S.andP;  corporations.andM;In addition, KU-Band VSATs are used for SNA/SDLC transmission fromapproximately 300 GM Acceptance Corp. financial institutions.andM;4.andP;  Mix in some X.25 packets ...andM;Several subsidiary networks reside on EDSNET.andP;  One of the most important isPACIT PLUS, an X.25 packet-switching system operated by EDS.andP;  Packetassemblers/disassemblers (PADs), attached to terminals, workstations andother devices, are used to segment incoming data into packets.andP;  Each packetconsists of source and destination addresses, the information, error-checkingcodes and other elements.andM;The packets comprise information that travels along different routes throughEDSNET, using the same backbone circuits as voice and data traffic, untilthey are reconnected to form a coherent message at their destination.andO;Memotec Datacom Inc. is the major supplier of PADs and Hughes Network SystemsInc. is the vendor for backbone packet switches and premise switch nodes.andO;Packet switches are installed in conjunction with circuit switches.andP;  Thesecircuit switches establish and automatically maintain dedicated circuits forpacket services in the backbone network.andM;Packet switching is used for traffic that is infrequent, small in volume,short and burst-like in nature and involves many locations.andP;  Examples:Communications from warehouses, network users talking to non-IBM hosts andusers who dial into a local network from remote locations or from portableterminals, rather than make a long-distance call directly to a major center.andM;5.andP;  And bring in the IMCandM;Up to 124 network operators monitor and analyze EDSNET's performance and workloads from the IMC's large, wedge-shaped command room.andP;  The staff usesback-lit, Windows-based workstations from such vendors as Digital and IBM.andO;Workstations are connected to interlinked IBM Token-Ring or DECnet networks.andO;Seven giant screens projected across the front wall contain information onsuch factors as the status of IPCs, network switches, front-end SNAprocessors and environmental monitoring equipment in the IMC facility.andM;Processes, equipment and software, known collectively as the NetworkManagement System (NMS), form the core of IMC operations.andP;  NMS, in turn,draws on both real-time and historical data about the network and its users,which is contained in IBM's DB-2 relational database that is accessed mainlyby Digital VAX computers.andM;Under the master NMS, EDS operates 27 element-management systems that controlsegments of the network, such as multiplexers, switches and the logical SNAnetwork, as specified by system vendors.andP;  Alarms and other events that arereported to the management systems are screened.andP;  Major events arereformatted and communicated to the NMS system, which can issue standardcommands to the individual element-management systems.andM;EDS has also developed and deployed an Automated Operating System (AOS).andP;  AOSis expert-system software that automatically responds to messages transmittedfrom the system being monitored: AOS either corrects the problem itself orobtains more information for priority display to communications staff.andP;  Inmany cases, this system allows for repair before customers know there'sanything wrong.andM;The IMC can also reroute traffic around IPCs and switching stations that areexperiencing problems.andP;  This was done last October when Hurricane Hugo struckthe Charlotte, N.C., area, where an IPC is located.andP;  Other IMC functionsinclude:andM;* Even-distribution of peak communication loads;andM;* Management of network security;andM;* Recording and coordination of changes to the network;andM;* Verification of vendor performance;andM;* Analysis of statistical trends in network performance;andM;* Creation of analytical models of the network for forecasting performance.andM;NMS architecture currently consists of Digital VAX and IBM or IBM-compatiblemachines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
