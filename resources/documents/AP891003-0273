DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sony Corp. intends to pay Hollywood producerPeter Guber and his partner as much as $14.1 million apiece overfive years to run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., it wasdisclosed Tuesday.   The tentative deal is dependent, however, on Guber and partnerJon Peters' ability to get out of a five-year movie-making contractwith Warner Communications Inc.   Last week Sony agreed to acquire Columbia Pictures for $3.4billion and to pay $200 million for Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.,a film and television production company that Guber and Peters head.   Guber and Peters recently signed five-year contracts to makefilms for Warner, including a sequel to Warner's summer box officesmash, ``Batman.''   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sonydisclosed that it had entered into an agreement with Guber andPeters that would pay them each $2.75 million a year for the first30 months of a five-year contract and $2.90 million a year for theremaining 30 months, ending March 31, 1995.   The salary will be ``adjusted annually to reflect the increase,if any, in the cost of living,'' according to the filing.   In addition, Guber, Peters and ``a group of individualexecutives not to exceed five'' to help them manage the new companywill be entitled to ``a portion of a bonus pool based on theearnings before interest and taxes of (the new company) and anequity participation based on a set formula pursuant to which themanagement will be entitled to receive in the aggregate up to 8.08percent of the increase in a formula-based market value of (the newentity) over a five-year period,'' the SEC filing said.   Guber and Peters would be paid less if Sony does not acquireGuber-Peters Entertainment, according to the filing.   But Sony reserved the right to terminate the merger agreementwith Guber-Peters Entertainment if the pair have not obtained awritten waiver to their Warner contract ``in form and substancesatisfactory'' to Sony by midnight, Oct. 25.   ``As of the date of this offer to purchase, discussions are inprogress among the relevant parties concerning the terms on whichsuch release might be obtained and there can be no assurance thatthe Warner waiver will be obtained,'' the filing stated.</TEXT></DOC>
