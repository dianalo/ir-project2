Bush's proposal, in his first speech to the U.N. GeneralAssembly as president, was designed to spur a 40-nation conferencein Geneva to ban chemical weapons entirely within 10 years.   He also used his appearance to salute ``freedom's march'' aroundthe world _ in Hungary, Poland, Latin America and Africa _ and topraise the Soviet Union for removing ``a number of obstacles'' inthe way of treaties to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, andtroops and tanks in Europe.   Bush noted progress on those issues and agreements on othermatters _ during talks last weekend between Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze _ as well as a decision to hold a summit meeting withSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by early next summer.   ``Let us act together _ beginning today _ to rid the earth ofthis scourge,'' Bush said in his comments on chemical weapons.Shevardnadze said after the speech that the Soviets had ``apositive view'' of the plan but that it and other Bush proposals``will have to be studied additionally.''   At a dinner later at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where he washost, President Bush and his wife shook the hands of 400 guests ina receiving line, among them Shevardnardze.   Shevardnardze told Bush, and later told Baker, also in thereceiving line, ``We have some news from Moscow.''   Baker replied that he and Shevardnardze should find some timeTuesday or Wednesday for a short chat.   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, saidthe news might be a response to Bush's chemical weapons proposal,but no one knew. He said the Soviets had been given an outline ofthe U.S. initiative in advance and ``they really have notresponded.''   He also told reporters at a briefing that Bush's proposal didnot include biological weapons, which some experts consider asdeadly as poison gas.   One year ago, during the first presidential candidates' debate,Bush had said, ``I want to be the one to banish chemical andbiological weapons from the face of the earth.'' The United Stateshas in the past accused the Soviets of developing biologicalweapons.   Congress has passed legislation requiring the administration todestroy old chemical weapons by 1997 as more advanced weapons arestockpiled. Asked about any connection between Bush's proposal andthe legal mandate to destroy a large percentage of such weapons,the White House official said that whether or not the new plan was``making a virtue of necessity it is certainly part of a majoreffort and a serious effort now.''   Twice, as vice president, Bush blocked legislation to destroyU.S. chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote. In those instances,the cutback would not have required Soviet reductions as well.   To get down to the equal stocks that Bush proposed, the Sovietswould have to make deeper cuts since they are thought to have morechemical weapons on hand. Only the two superpowers acknowledgehaving poison gas, but Bush said more than 20 nations eitherpossess them or can produce them.   The Reagan administration singled out Libya as being on theverge of producing chemical weapons with the assistance of WestGerman firms.   Baker told reporters, ``This proposal really attacks theproliferation problem by making it impossible for these countriesto argue that major countries have them and are just dragging theirfeet in chemical weapons negotiations.''   Bush, who served as U.S. permanent representative at the UnitedNations in 1971 and 1972, described his visit and speech as ahomecoming. The delegates interrupted him twice with applause _when he proposed the chemical weapons reductions and when hereported progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.   At one point, he also mourned the slaying of Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage on a U.N. mission inLebanon in February 1988 and subsequently slain. He called Higgins``a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving dedication to theU.N. ideal'' and called on the General Assembly to condemn themurder.   Bush's chemical weapons proposal has three key elements:   _The United States was ``ready to begin now'' by eliminatingmore than 80 percent of its stockpile while working on a treaty,provided the Soviets also made their cuts.   _In the first eight years of a 40-nation treaty the UnitedStates would destroy nearly all _ 98 percent _ of its chemicalweapons if the Soviet Union joined the ban.   _All U.S. chemical weapons _ ``100 percent, every one'' _ wouldbe destroyed within 10 years, once all nations capable of buildingsuch weapons signed a total ban treaty.   As for superpower relations, Bush said he saw ``signs of a newattitude'' in U.S.-Soviet relations. Also, ``we are witnessing anideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of theomniscient, all-powerful state.''   As for chemical weapons, he said, ``These horrible weapons arenow finding their way into regional conflicts. ... This isunacceptable.''   Bush referred to the use of poison gas by Iran and Iraq in theirPersian Gulf war. The threat is considered potentially explosiveespecially in the Middle East where Syria is feared to havechemical weapons that could be placed on the tip of missiles andfired at Israel.   Bush acknowledged monitoring and enforcing a ban would be achallenge. But, he said, inspection procedures developed fornuclear weapons cutbacks offer useful experience.   American chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at about30,000 tons. A small portion is stored in West Germany.   The Soviet Union has admitted to possessing about 50,000 tons,though some analysts believe the arsenal is larger.   Baker outlined the plan to Shevardnadze at their talks lastweekend in Jackson Hole, Wyo.   There they agreed to exchange information about U.S. and Sovietchemical weapons and to conduct cross-inspections of arsenals andplants.   Shevardnadze said Monday that ``from the very beginning we stoodfor the total elimination of all chemical stockpiles.''   In a long day in New York,the President also hosted a lunch forthe foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Australia, Japan and South Korea, and held separate meetings withPresident Jose Sarney of Brazil, Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peresof Israel, President Vinizio Cerezo of Guatemala, President CarlosAndres Peres of Venezuela and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens ofIsrael.   At dinner, the President said in a toast ``the resolution ofconflicts by non-violent, political means has now taken centerstage. And the U.N. is leading the way.''   He was nearly 20 minutes late for the dinner and offered ``Athousand apologies'' when he and his wife finally arrived.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wasdelayed by meetings with the foreign ministers of Hungary,Yugoslavia and Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
