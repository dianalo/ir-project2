Sixteen U.S. earthquake experts will leave for Armenia in sevento 10 days, Gail Porter, spokeswoman for the U.S. National Academyof Sciences, said Tuesday in Irvine.   The agreements were announced after meetings in Washington lastweek and in Irvine this week between officials of the Americanacademy and a 17-member delegation from the Academy of Sciences ofthe U.S.S.R., Porter said.   The Dec. 7 quake in Soviet Armenia, centered near theSoviet-Turkish border, measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and killedat least 55,000 people, according to Soviet officials.   The U.S. and Soviet academies also will form a new joint AcademyCommittee on Global Ecology, which will ``assess global threats toEarth's ecological well-being.''   Among other problems, the committee will consider warming ofEarth's climate by the ``greenhouse effect,'' depletion of theprotective ozone layer, extinction of thousands of plant and animalspecies, exhaustion of energy supplies and other natural resources,and widespread pollution.   ``The consequences of the rapid growth of our population coupledwith global economic development now pose a significant threat toour continued existence,'' the academies said in a joint statement.   The Americans will visit Armenia ``to improve scientificunderstanding of such earthquakes, engineering knowledge of thefailure of structures and techniques for post-disaster assessment,and to allow early application of this knowledge to reduce theeffects of such disasters in the future,'' said Frank Press,president of the American academy.   The U.S. team will include seismologists, architects, structuraland geotechnical engineers, and experts on industrial facilities,rescue operations, emergency planning and utility lifelines, Presssaid in a statement.   Since 1964, the U.S. academy has organized similar teams toconduct on-site investigations of disasters, including earthquakes,in Alaska, Mexico City, central Greece, Algeria, Romania and Turkey,the academy said.   The committee will meet once or twice annually, with the firstmeeting expected during the first half of 1989 in the Soviet Union.   The group will monitor scientific and policy needs involvingenvironmental problems, identify way to better understand complexecological issues, emphasize subjects not receiving adequateattention, and make periodic reports to both governments.   The American team of earthquake experts visiting Armenia will beled by seismologist John Filson, former head of the U.S. GeologicalSurvey's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering, andMikhran Agbabian, chairman of the University of SouthernCalifornia's civil engineering department.</TEXT></DOC>
