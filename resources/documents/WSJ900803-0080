The FDIC chief, William Seidman, in testimony before theSenate Banking Committee, said there have been &quot;maybe two orthree instances where it would appear that people were tryingto push us to a decision&quot; regarding &quot;particulartransactions.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In answer to a question by Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.),Mr. Seidman said he had been subject to such pressure, butthat it had been &quot;a very minor factor.&quot; He didn't explainwhat form the pressure took, how he responded, or whatdecisions or financial institutions were involved. NeitherMr. Bryan nor any of his colleagues pressed the bank andthrift regulator to elaborate on his response.   The issue of political influence of thrift regulation hasbeen raised in recent weeks by the case of Arizonabusinessman James Fail, who purchased 15 insolvent Texas Sandamp;Lsfrom the government in 1988. An investigation by a SenateJudiciary subcommittee has revealed that Mr. Fail, who had anumber of previous legal problems, made the purchase underextremely favorable financial terms after a former adviser tothen-Vice President George Bush lobbied regulators on hisbehalf.   In yesterday's hearing, Mr. Seidman admitted that in aseparate government sale to Mr. Fail of an Oklahoma bank,federal regulators &quot;didn't have all the information on him weshould have had.&quot;   Mr. Seidman said the FDIC and the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation were jointly reviewing Mr. Fail's purchases inTexas for possible civil fraud and criminal violations. Mr.Fail has previously denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Seidmanreiterated that the FDIC is reviewing a large number ofgovernment sales of failed thrifts in the Southwest in 1988and would consider trying to undo transactions found to havebeen tainted by fraud. The regulator conceded that there wereopportunities for speculative and fraudulent profits in thegovernment's heavily subsidized sales of insolvent Sandamp;Ls. &quot;Welive in terror of what is going on out there,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
