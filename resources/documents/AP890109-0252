The object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar, a dead, collapsedstar that is orbited by a larger, ordinary star.   Astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away itscompanion in the last phase of an intricate give and take betweenthe two distant orbs.   ``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio ofCornell University. ``It is constantly losing matter. Eventually itcould completely disappear.''   Astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion tobuild up tremendous spinning speed, then turns on its mate, burningit up.</TEXT><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A second attempt to learn how many Americanscarry the AIDS virus was launched Monday with the mailing of lettersto 350 households asking people to anonymously reveal their sexualpractices and give blood in return for $50.
