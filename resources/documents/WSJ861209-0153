It didn't say how much.    Last year, the data communications concern earned $175,000, or three cents a share, on revenue of $18.8 million.    James C. Hahn, president and chief executive officer, said factors contributing to the loss included lower revenue, anticipated write-downs, and losses stemming from certain investments. He also cited a provision of &quot;additional reserves&quot; for inventory adjustments and the initial expense of introducing a cost-cutting program.    Mr. Hahn predicted the company would return to &quot;normal&quot; profit levels in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
