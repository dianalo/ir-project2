In Pakistan, government officials said Sunday that more than 1million people had been left homeless by flooding in the easternpart of the country. The official death toll was at 31 butunofficial reports have said many more died.   In India's Punjab state, governor S.S. Ray said the three majorrivers in the region had receded below danger level, allowingworkers to step up relief efforts.   However, he said about 200,000 people were still marooned in1,650 villages and at least 142 people were reported missing.   Relief workers used boats to try to rescue trapped villagers,officials said. Helicopters dropped packages of food and othersupplies into the flooded areas, and Indian air force transportplanes carried gasoline, diesel and kerosene into areas where roadand rail service had been cut off.   Officials also were trying to determine the extent of cropdamage in Punjab, which produces more than half of the country'swheat and rice.   The official death toll from the flash floods, which struckPunjab and the neighboring state of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana andJammu-Kashmir beginning Sept. 22, stood at 414. But news reports,most unattributed, put the tally as high as 800.   Floods frequently batter the subcontinent when the summermonsoons begin in late June. In August, more than 1,000 people diedin neighboring Bangladesh in that country's worst flooding.Hundreds of thousands were left homeless.   The Associated Press of Pakistan reported Sunday that nearly2,000 villages there were hit by flooding from heavy rains inmid-September and more than 850,000 acres of land were still underwater.   Lahore, the ancient Punjab capital of 6 million people, remainedcut off from most of western and northern Pakistan. Parts of thehighway linking Lahore to Islamabad, the nation's capital, had beenunder water for several days.   Army soldiers have been flying over the hardest hit areas anddropping sealed food bags to people still clinging to their roofsto escape the water. Food along with medical supplies were alsoferried to stranded residents by motor boat.   Officials said at least 1 million residents were forced to leavetheir homes.   The threat from the Ravi and Chenab rivers in Pakistan's easternPunjab province has passed but the Sutlej River flowing west fromIndia continues to be a problem, officials said. They said theSutlej, only a trickle since India built a dam 30 years ago, hasrisen dramatially.   Leaders of the flood stricken countries have called forcooperation in fighting the floods.   Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Nepal's KingBirendra's agreed to ``mitigate the incidence of floods in thefuture,'' according to a joint statement released in Katmandu.   Ershad visited Nepal on Sunday. The two agreed to support theidea that any solution to the problems of managing naturaldisasters requires regional cooperation involving all countries inthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.   The group includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.   Ershad also visited India Thursday for talks with Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhi as part of his campaign for international support tocontrol flooding.</TEXT></DOC>
