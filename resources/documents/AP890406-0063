India closed 13 of its 15 customs checkpoints along the1,090-mile border with the Himalayan kingdom after the trade andtransit treaties expired March 23. Most of Nepal's foreign trade iswith India or conducted through India.   After the treaties expired, the supply of essential items suchas medicine, fuel and baby food stopped, Mrs. Shah said.   ``We are flying in medicines from Bangkok or Singapore,'' shetold the newspaper in an interview Wednesday.   Nepal has asked India to hold talks either in Katmandu or in NewDelhi to complete drafts of new treaties. India has yet to respond.   Mrs. Shah said the two countries signed and approved a drafttreaty on Oct. 12, 1988. But India abrogated the draft on March 1and told Nepal the trade and transit arrangement would lapse, shesaid.   India has insisted on a unified trade and transit treaty, whichMrs. Shah said was ``a regressive step since transit is arecognized right of access to sea of landlocked countries, a rightwhich has also been recongnized by India,'' she was quoted assaying.   The two countries have maintained friendly ties for decades, butIndia became increasingly concerned about Nepal's relations withChina.   India and China fought a border war in 1962 and since then theirrelations have remained uneasy. In August, Nepal bought unspecifiedChinese arms for its 30,000-man armed forces.   In the interview, Mrs. Shah said the arms acquisition was purelyfor the internal security of Nepal, to guard against possibleterrorist attacks.   Nepal, locked between India and China, has to maintain goodrelations with both, and there is ``no question of Nepal havingimproved relations with any country at the cost of India,'' theStatesman quoted Mrs. Shah as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
