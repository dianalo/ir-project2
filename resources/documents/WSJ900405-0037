Business activity has shifted to &quot;the dark side of theplanet,&quot; says bankruptcy lawyer Brad Scheler of Fried, Frank,Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson. &quot;Everybody believes thatbankruptcy and workouts are the current rage,&quot; prompting alot of people to develop products tailored to this market. Hehas a seven-inch file filled with fliers and letters fromcompanies offering such services. Among them: accountants,liquidators, software companies, consultants and appraisalfirms.</LP><TEXT>   Consultant Claudia King andamp; Associates, Jersey City, N.J.,which specializes in software for handling Chapter 11paperwork, has doubled its staff in the past year. &quot;We'reprobably busier than we've ever been,&quot; says New York-basedturnaround specialist Abe Getzler, a 20-year veteran. He'sbecome &quot;selective&quot; about clients.   Fueling the growth: a population that is &quot;less reluctant&quot;to resort to the bankruptcy court, says New Jersey bankruptcyattorney Peter Sarasohn.                                                                                                          U.S. THEATERS boast impressive gains, but fear comingcutbacks.   A survey of 192 nonprofit professional companies shows&quot;unprecedented&quot; financial and audience growth in 1989, saysBarbara Janowitz of the Theatre Communications Group. &quot;Earnedincome, operating expenses and contributed income allregistered double-digit growth in 1989.&quot; But hidden in thosefigures are some real problems, she says, noting that somehalf dozen theaters have closed in the past nine months.   Survivors are girding for possible erosion in theircorporate and government support. Crossroads Theatre Co., NewBrunswick, N.J., is facing &quot;some pretty serious cuts&quot; due tothe state's current fiscal crunch, says Andre Robinson Jr.,general manager. Competition for foundation dollars from thehomeless and other causes will make 1990-91 feel a bittighter, says Barry Grove of the Manhattan Theatre Club.Hartford Stage Co. plans larger ticket price increasesbecause individual support is one area &quot;we've got somecontrol over,&quot; says managing director David Hawkanson.                                                                                                          PROFIT GYRATIONS are likely under future accounting rules.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has launched acontroversial project to more accurately value financialinstruments -- ranging from debt swaps to stock options.&quot;Seeking latest values -- called marking to market -- couldsharply boost earnings volatility,&quot; says a Citicorp official.The project follows recent woes of banks and thrifts, whosefinancial reports didn't give enough warning of comingproblems.   Some corporate critics say the change may confuse ratherthan help investors. But Halsey Bullen, an FASB projectmanager, says up-to-date tags for financial instruments&quot;better reflect current rapidly changing unstable financialmarkets.&quot; A first step: a just-issued FASB rule requiringworst-case scenarios on credit risks. Some banks already callit &quot;overalarming disclosure.&quot; Bankers Trust's maximumexposure of $6.5 billion on currency and interest rate swaps,for example, dwarfs 1989 profit of $620 million afterforeign-loan set-asides.   The reason: It &quot;assumes all parties won't pay up,&quot; saysthe bank's controller Richard Carbone.                                                                                                          SMOKELESS SLOPES: Tobacco companies won't be sponsoringany more events on Aspen Skiing Co. mountains. Says RobertMaynard, president, such corporate sponsorship isn't&quot;consistent with a healthy family sport like skiing.&quot;                                                                                                          CAPITAL SPENDING will slip in 1990, according to a Dun andamp;Bradstreet Corp. survey. Some 41% of companies said they'llboost spending on plants and equipment, down from 46% lastyear. But plans don't mean action. Last year only 23.3%actually expanded their capital program.                                                                                                          BLEACHER BUSINESS: Houston Astros season-ticket holderscan now wheel and deal from the ballpark. Houston CellularTelephone Co. will take a phone message, then cart a cellularphone to the fan's seat, along with a portable fax machineand a laptop computer.                                                                                                          TRANSLATE THIS, more firms say, as their marketing crossesmore borders.   The number of translators is growing as American businesslearns to deal with &quot;a world in which America is no longerthe predominant economic power,&quot; says Tom Snow, a New Yorktranslator. One area of big demand: translations of Japanesepatent applications into English, says Deanna Hammond of theAmerican Translators Association, Ossining, N.Y. Translationof U.S. ads into European languages is also a growing marketas 1992 Common Market integration nears, says TranslationAces, N.Y.   Changes in Eastern Europe are just beginning to hit thetranslation market. Accurapid Translation Services Inc.,Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is asked to translate Hungarian balancesheets and other corporate data for U.S. investors. High-techvocabulary makes the job tougher. It's growing so fast &quot;it'sdifficult to stay abreast of all the language changes,&quot; saysShuckran Kamal, Herndon, Va., translator of Arabic.   As demand grows, translators begin to organize, lobbyingon phone rates and other matters affecting their business.
