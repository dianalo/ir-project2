The banks -- Lakeland State Bank, Pequot Lakes, Minn., and Farmers State Bank, Lueders, Texas -- are to reopen today as branches of other institutions.    Lakeland State was closed Friday by the Minnesota finance commissioner. It will reopen as the Pequot Lakes Branch of Northern National Bank, Bemidji, Minn. Lakeland had assets totaling $46.5 million and held deposits of $46.5 million in 13,800 accounts.    Northern National agreed to pay the FDIC a $109,000 purchase premium and to buy loans and other assets of the failed bank for $33.8 million. The FDIC will advance Northern National $12.6 million and retain assets of Lakeland State valued at $12.6 million.    Lakeland State was the fifth bank to fail in Minnesota this year.    Farmers State is to become a branch of Farmers andamp; Merchants National Bank of Merkel, Texas. The failed bank had assets totaling $9.1 million and held $8.4 million in 1,600 deposit accounts when Texas banking authorities closed it Friday.    Farmers andamp; Merchants National agreed to pay the FDIC a purchase premium of $5,000 and to buy assets of the failed bank for $5.3 million.
