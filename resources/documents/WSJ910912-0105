The Journal,of course, has long dismissed the significance of theIran-Contra scandal to which Mr. Gates is linked. In fliptones, this paper's editors have written: &quot;We admit to notknowing how much Mr. Gates knew, and especially to notcaring.&quot; Columnist Ken Adelman went even further in theWashington Times, arguing that because Mr. Gates's connectionto Iran-Contra is trivial the Democratic opposition to himmust also be based on the idea that Mr. Gates &quot;is lessrisk-averse and more strongly identified with presidentialleadership&quot; than some senators would like.   But what Mr. Gates knew and should have known shoulddecide whether he is confirmed. Mr. Gates, who served as theagency's deputy director under William Casey, says he wasunaware of the bizarre scheme orchestrated by Oliver North touse the proceeds of the sale of weapons to Iran to fundNicaragua's Contras.</LP><TEXT>   Perhaps Mr. Casey did cut him out of the illicit program.Mr. Gates, however, admits that he had heard some rumors ofthe North operation before it became public, but disregardedwhat he termed the &quot;flimsy&quot; evidence. He also acknowledgesthat Col. North once mentioned Swiss bank accounts and theContras, but Mr. Gates ignored the comment because &quot;I didn'tknow what he was talking about.&quot; Indeed, in 1987 Mr. Gatesadmitted to congressional investigators that &quot;we activelydiscouraged people from telling us things.&quot;   Even more disturbing is the fact that Mr. Gates wassandwiched between several officials -- Casey; Clair George,the deputy director for covert operations who was indictedFriday; Jerry Gruner, chief of the agency's Latin Americandivision; and Alan Fiers, head of CIA operations in CentralAmerica -- who were running the extraconstitutional Contraproject. Although that doesn't mean Mr. Gates necessarilyknew about the secret aid, it does require that his claim becarefully scrutinized.   Mr. Gates's story has become slightly less believable withthe recent revelation that, contrary to his originalassertion, he in fact met several times with Mr. Fiers in1986 and served as interagency coordinator of the limited,legal assistance program for the Contras. That aid,emphasizes the administration, was approved by Congress. ButMr. Gates's involvement in the Nicaraguan issue and hismeetings with a subordinate who knew about Col. North'soperation add power to the argument that he either knew orshould have known about Iran-Contra.   Computer messages moreover indicate that Mr. Gates talkedwith National Security Council Director John Poindexter, anactive participant in the scheme, about a proposal to lease acargo ship to transfer arms to the Contras and thepossibility of the agency purchasing the entire resupplysystem for the Contras if Congress approved more aid.Finally, there is a reference in Col. North's office diarythat suggests he discussed his activities at a lunch with theCIA director and Mr. Gates, though the latter says Col. Northassured him the CIA was not involved.   The many supporters of Mr. Gates who don't believe he knewabout Col. North's operation may be right. But certainlythere is enough evidence to warrant investigating the charge-- unless one doesn't believe involvement in Iran-Contrashould bar a person from heading the CIA. In PatrickBuchanan's view, for instance, Congress was guilty of a&quot;criminal betrayal&quot; in cutting off money to the Contras,while &quot;the CIA men who discovered Ollie's diversion and didnot report it, were loyal to a cause that was just.&quot; If theydissembled, it was &quot;perhaps because they came to believeCongress was on the other side.&quot;   That Congress leaves much to be desired goes withoutsaying. But the relative courage of Col. North and theaverage legislator does not change the fact that thediversion scheme was a direct assault on our system ofconstitutional liberty. A small group of men apparentlybypassed the president, lied to Congress, and used part ofthe proceeds of the sale of weapons paid for by taxpayers toimplement their own private foreign policy. That these peoplemay have been well-meaning doesn't matter: the Constitutionplaces the power of the purse in Congress, not with a handfulof executive appointees. It is for the voters, not the CIAdirector and a Marines Corps detailee to the NSC, to decidethat Congress is &quot;on the other side.&quot;   And there's a reason for that. The American government wasnot intended to be dominated by the executive. Instead, theFounders hoped to protect individual liberty by creating asystem that dispersed power to different levels and branchesof government. The drafters even chopped the authority toconduct foreign affairs into several different powers andgave many of them -- most important, the authority to raisearmies, declare war and approve treaties, as well as thepower to appropriate money -- to Congress.   For years it was conservatives who fought to prevent theconsolidation of power in the federal government and theexecutive branch. Yet the failure of Republicans to wincontrol of the House in nearly four decades has increasinglyled many of them to long for American-style Gaullism.   Last fall numerous conservatives backed George Bush'sclaim that he could unilaterally transfer one-fourth of theU.S. military thousands of miles from home and launch afull-scale war on another sovereign state. The Journal haschampioned the idea that the president has an inherentline-item veto power. Some analysts now argue that theConstitution prevents Congress from limiting the activitiesthat appropriated funds may be used for and allows thepresident to fire the heads of independent agencies. Inshort, today many conservatives want their presidents to belike the liberal activists of yore: Woodrow Wilson, FranklinDelano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, who allexpanded executive power.   But there were good reasons why conservatives were thesharpest critics of these &quot;strong&quot; presidents -- that &quot;Mr.Republican&quot; Robert Taft, for instance, argued that Truman didnot have the constitutional authority to take the countryinto war in Korea. These conservatives' concerns overconcentrated executive power remain equally valid today.Indeed, Taft, along with any number of believers in limitedgovernment, would have been dismayed at the argument thatsomeone should be confirmed as CIA director even though heaided or ignored a scheme that improperly circumventedCongress.   What did Robert Gates know and what should he have known?Congress has a duty to find out. If it turns out that Mr.Gates was involved in, or consciously ignored, theIran-Contra operation, his nomination should be rejected byconservatives and liberals alike. Our system ofconstitutional liberty is too important to sacrifice fortemporary partisan gain. On the Gates question, the Journalwonders, &quot;Don't these people have anything better to askabout?&quot; The answer is no.   ---   Mr. Bandow is a fellow at the Cato Institute and served asa special assistant to President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
