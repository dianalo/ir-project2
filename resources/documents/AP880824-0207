Defense Minister Rupert Scholz found no grounds for refusing theU.S. request to base the helicopters at a U.S. air field nearWiesbaden in September, the ministry said in a statement.   Earlier this month, the Hesse state parliament told the DefenseMinistry it objected to more helicopters being based nearWiesbaden, saying air traffic was overcrowded near Frankfurt'sinternational airport.   Wiesbaden is 25 miles west of Frankfurt.   However, the Defense Ministry said that after careful studyScholz decided the advantages of the helicopters in boosting theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization's security and defense of WestGermany outweighed objections to the stationing.   But the statement said the decision was limited to the basingonly of the 39 additional attack helicopters and does not includethe U.S. military's plans to expand to 181 total aircraft at theair base by 1993.   There are currently 57 U.S. military helicopters based at theWiesbaden site.   The U.S. Army released a statement late Wednesday which said theministry's decision ``confirmed the planned stationing is withinthe scope of international agreements governing the use ofWiesbaden air base by U.S. forces.''</TEXT></DOC>
