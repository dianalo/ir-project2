Although resin bolts provide superior roofsupport compared to mechanical anchors, they are expensive, toxic, andflammable. The bolting operation itself is a bottleneck in most mines,while installation of bolts is one of the most hazardous jobs underground.In the United States, innovations in roof bolting systems are being madein three principal areas - productivity, safety and cost. The problemof improved safety, increased productivity and lower bolting costs hasbeen addressed through the development of lower cost cementitious materialsfor grouted bolts, in a versatile bulk-storage and injection system.This novel system was initiated by the US Bureau of Mines and furtherdeveloped by Terra Tek, Inc. for automatically drilling the hole, mixingand injecting an extremely fast-setting and high-strength inorganic grout,and installing a headed rebar - at substantial cost savings and productivityimprovement over conventional methods, while maintaining the safety achievedwith resin bolts. Laboratory and field pull-test data, in three minutesafter placement, have shown the cement to develop strengths about a thirdhigher than with resin bolts, along with a stiffness from over two-thirdsto twice that of the fastest setting resin available. Cycle times areshorter than for a conventional resin system, and thereby expected toresult in about a 10% productivity improvement. The configuration ofthe components lends itself to full automation and remote operation.In low seam mines this system can be combined with the 'flexible drill'and 'bolt-bender'-inserter', two devices also developed under US Bureauof Mines' sponsorship. The application of this system to low seam minesis discussed, along with its impact on improved roof control and safety.16 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
