By a 5-4 vote, the high court said that under the EighthAmendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment itisn't enough to prove that prison conditions are belowminimum standards. A prisoner must also show that theseinadequate conditions were the result of &quot;deliberateindifference.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The case involved a lawsuit filed by an Ohio inmate whoalleged a broad range of inadequate prison conditions,including: overcrowding; poor heating, cooling andventilation; unsanitary restrooms and dining facilities; andhousing with mentally ill and physically sick inmates. Thepractical effect of the ruling, written by Justice AntoninScalia, is that prison officials can avoid liability for allthese practices by saying they lack the funds to improve theconditions and can't obtain more state money.   The court stopped short of adopting an even tougherstandard that would have required prisoners to prove thatofficials acted &quot;wantonly&quot; or &quot;maliciously.&quot; The court saidthis stricter standard is reserved for special circumstances,such as injuries that result from prison violence.   Prison-rights advocates said they were optimistic thatthey can continue to challenge prison conditions using thelegal standard adopted yesterday and expressed relief thatthe court didn't impose the tougher standard.   The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Byron White,and joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun andJohn Stevens, was less optimistic. The dissent said it willbe difficult to prove that officials acted deliberatelybecause &quot;inhumane prison conditions often are the result ofcumulative actions and inactions by numerous officials insideand outside a prison, sometimes over a long period of time.&quot;   The high court overturned the ruling of a federal appealscourt in Cincinnati that applied the tougher wantonnessstandard and sent the case back for reconsideration. Thecourt was unanimous in finding that the appeals court appliedthe wrong standard.

The court, in an opinion written by Justice Stevens, saidthe presence of members of Congress on the board violates theseparation of powers required by the Constitution. The courtducked the question of whether the board was exercisinglegislative or executive power, concluding that eithercharacterization was unconstitutional.   The law gave local Virginia and District of Columbiaofficials authority to manage the airports, subject to reviewof budget, bond authority and master plan by a boardcomprising nine members of Congress.   Justice White dissented, joined by Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist and Justice Marshall. (Metropolitan WashingtonAirports Authority vs. Citizens For Abatement of AircraftNoise)</TEXT></DOC>
