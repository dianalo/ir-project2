In the Senate, the passage of a similar bill was blocked, withan opposition senator warning the legislation moved the nation astep closer to dictatorship. The Senate is expected to pass asimilar version Thursday.   The bill was passed overwhelmingly on second reading in thelower chamber. A final reading will be held Thursday.   Lone opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who once administeredmartial law under the late Ferdinand Marcos, denounced theemergency decree as a move toward dictatorship. But former humanrights lawyer Sen. Rene Saguisag defended the move in light of therecent coup attempt.   In a speech before the Senate, Enrile said the emergency powersalso could be used to extend the lease on the U.S. military basesin the Philippines.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said today that rebel soldiers wholaunched the coup attempt Dec. 1 were still capable of stagingterror attacks and assassinations, although they surrendered theirlast stronghold Saturday.   Ramos told a news conference the government will no longer seekU.S. air cover over Philippine territory.   U.S. jets flew over rebel-held bases to discourage more bombingruns on the Malacanang presidential palace, and the U.S. helpturned the tide in favor of the government on the first day of themutiny.   The Cabinet also was told that the business community is lookingfor signs the government will move decisively to address thepolitical, social and economic damage wrought by the sixth andbloodiest attempt so far to oust Mrs. Aquino. Share prices on theManila Stock Exchange fell for the third consecutive day sincetrading resumed after the coup attempt.   On Dec. 6, Mrs. Aquino declared a nationwide state of emergency,but officials said the legislation would give her further powers.   The House and Senate versions of the emergency bill grant Mrs.Aquino the power to order the search for weapons and ammunition inprivate homes without the normal legal constraints.   The House voted against allowing Mrs. Aquino to intervene inlabor disputes and suspend labor laws which may impede production.A majority of the 23-member Senate voted to keep the provision,regarded by critics as a strike ban.   Both versions allow Mrs. Aquino to take over public utilities,such as privately-owned transportation firms if they violate``national policy.''   The House bill limits Mrs. Aquino's emergency powers to a 90-dayperiod, while the Senate version extends it up to six months.</TEXT></DOC>
