(Product enhancement).andO;Product:   Rumba (Computer network software) (Product enhancement).andO;Topic:     Terminal EmulationCommunications softwareEnhancements.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Paula MusichandM;Wall Data Inc. expanded its Rumba dance card last week with seven new add-onsfor the Windows-based PC-to-mainframe communications package.andM;The Redmond, Wash., developer unveiled an AS/400 connectivity option thatlets Rumba users concurrently access PC, IBM midrange and mainframeapplications.andP;  Wall Data also introduced new LAN gateway software, four newdevelopment tools and a package for accessing mainframe graphicsapplications.andM;The AS/400 add-on provides a &quot;hot links&quot; feature to let Rumba users cut andpaste information among AS/400, IBM mainframe and local Windows applications,according to John Wall, the company's chairman and founder.andM;The $100 package provides a graphical front end to the AS/400's PC Supportprogram for 5250 terminal emulation and shared printing of PC and AS/400printers.andP;  The AS/400 option links to the AS/400 via Token-Ring,asynchronous, synchronous data link control (SDLC) and twinaxial connections.andM;With an emphasis on open architecture, Wall Data's new Rumba Gateway Systemsoftware connects users on Ethernet and Token-Ring networks to IBM hosts.andM;In addition to Rumba, the gateway package works with IBM's PersonalCommunications/3270, Digital Communications Associates Inc.'s IRMALANworkstation and Attachmate Corp.'s Extra 3270 emulation software.andM;For beta user US Healthcare, the gateway's ability to link Ethernet LAN usersto mainframes connected on a Token-Ring network -- without a noticeableperformance loss -- was key.andM;&quot;When we looked at all the popular gateways on the market, nobody had anEthernet-to-Token-Ring gateway for Windows-based workstations that supported3Com's NetBIOS,&quot; said Bill Davis, telecommunications manager for the BlueBell, Pa., company.andP;  &quot;Our users require subsecond response time, and thegateway is very well received, even by direct coax-attached users.&quot;andM;The $895 gateway software, which connects to IBM hosts using IBM SDLC links,the Rumba SDLC coprocessor adapter, Token-Ring links or Ethernet attachments,also includes several gateway management features, including the ability tobalance processing loads across several Rumba gateways on the same network.andM;The new developers tools come in four flavors: a kit that supports DynamicData Exchange, one for the EHLLAPI programming interface, one for AsymetrixCorp.'s ToolBook and one for network management.andP;  Each tool set is priced at$195.andM;The graphics option, which works in conjunction with the base Rumba software,provides access to mainframe-based all points addressable graphicsapplications.andP;  It is priced at $100.andP;  The new add-ons will be available thismonth directly from Wall Data.andM;Wall Data can be contacted at (206) 883-4777.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
