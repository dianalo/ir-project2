Jefferson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>12/28/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE 3</SO><CO>   FEXC</CO><IN>INSURANCE (INS)LIFE INSURANCE (INL)</IN><LP>   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. agreed not to writenew insurance policies in New Jersey, a move apparentlydesigned to save face for both the company and stateinsurance regulators, who had demanded a $500 million depositfrom the ailing company as security.   New Jersey drew sharp criticism from insurance regulatorsin other states when earlier this month it gave FirstExecutive a one-week deadline to post a $500 million depositto cover policyholders in the state in the event of anyinsolvency, or face a cease-and-desist order barring it fromany new business in the state. New Jersey is one of the fewstates without an industry-supported guaranty fund for lifeinsurance policyholders.</LP><TEXT>   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, theguiding body for the state insurance agencies, called the NewJersey action &quot;irresponsible,&quot; and officials in Californiaand New York -- principal overseers of First Executive's twoExecutive Life companies -- said they would block any depositdemand by New Jersey.   But yesterday's agreement averted any such showdown. &quot;Wesought this agreement as a wise and prudent step to protectNew Jersey policyholders while we assess the financialstrength of the companies,&quot; New Jersey's insurancecommissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, said.   First Executive said the move had been &quot;voluntary&quot; on itspart, and that it is &quot;confident&quot; that New Jersey regulatorswill find its operating units &quot;financially capable of meetingall obligations to policyholders of all states.&quot; FirstExecutive's action is somewhat academic, since its ExecutiveLife units aren't writing much new business anywhere,according to company filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission.   The New Jersey regulators didn't say how long it might bebefore First Executive could resume writing policies in thestate. First Executive said it is confident it will be ableto resume business there, although it pointed out that &quot;NewJersey has never represented a substantial source of businessfor us.&quot; Executive Life in California writes about 1.3% ofits nationwide business in New Jersey, covering 12,717individuals, and the New York company writes about 6.5% ofits business in the state, covering 12,319 individuals.   The agreement, however, didn't win the favor of thealliance of state insurance regulators who have been workingtogether for months to contain the difficulties in FirstExecutive's insurance operations.   The agreement &quot;gives the appearance of a face-savinggesture as opposed to really accomplishing anything,&quot; saidLarry Gorski of the Illinois Department of Insurance,spokesman for the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners group overseeing operations of First Executive.&quot;There's the possibility that policyholders might become evenmore concerned over the situation.&quot; The regulators had fearedthat New Jersey's attempt might prompt a series of demands byvarious states for deposits or other special treatment,scuttling months of regulatory effort to contain the problemsat First Executive.   First Executive, parent of Executive Life Insurance Co. inCalifornia and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, fellvictim to plunging junk bond markets and was forced to take$859 million in writedowns earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
