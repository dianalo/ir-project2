The slowly developing disaster continues. The grossdomestic product of sub-Saharan Africa has declined about 10%in the last five years. The entire region (excluding SouthAfrica) has an economy smaller than Belgium's.</LP><TEXT>   Maria Thomas set all her work against this landscape ofcollapse. She first saw Africa with her husband as a PeaceCorps volunteer in Ethiopia in 1971. From then on, even whenshe was away, Africa was at the center of her life. In 1987,she published (after years of publishers' rejections) twobrilliant books, her only novel, &quot;Antonia Saw the OryxFirst,&quot; and the story collection &quot;Come to Africa and SaveYour Marriage.&quot; Two years later, she and her husband hadreturned to their beloved Ethiopia, working on aid projectsamid the famine and civil war. They died in a plane crashwith Texas Rep. Mickey Leland, who was on a tour of refugeecamps.   Now, Soho Press, the small publisher that published Ms.Thomas when others wouldn't, has assembled from her papers&quot;African Visas&quot; (242 pages, $19.95), a collection of sixstories and a novella.   One of the great appeals of Ms. Thomas's work is theabsence of sentimentality. Nostalgia, she writes, is theveneer travelers fix over uncomfortable things. Ms. Thomasfixes no veneers. Hers is a world of uncomfortable things.She sees more fools than saints, but even for the saints,things often end badly.   She writes about the intersection of African andexpatriate lives. An expatriate has privileges, but pays aprice for foolish decisions, for boredom, drink orill-considered sex. In one story, a Peace Corps volunteerchooses a young Ethiopian over her husband with sad results.In another, an elderly Back Bay matron goes gently mad amonguncomprehending rural Africans.   An elderly American visits her daughter in Lagos and isappalled by the African art, Nigerian manners and Nigerianfood she encounters. She deeply regrets that her grandson hasbeen given an African name and that her daughter's hair anddress have gone native. Seeking to express herself withoutoffending, she tells her daughter: &quot;I am sure that ourancestors came from some other part of Africa. A nicer part.&quot;   Africans and expatriates are as often tied together bymisunderstanding as by sympathy. In the novella &quot;The JiruRoad,&quot; a young Peace Corps volunteer doubles over in laughteras she watches a flood prove the futility of a painfullybuilt Peace Corps bridge and road: &quot;. . . the two of ushowled because we saw that there was no end to theridiculousness of white men and their amazing schemes.&quot;   In her wonderful novel, Ms. Thomas wrote that expatriates'real problem is that their choices have no consequence. Theymay be privileged, but they are essentially powerless inAfrica.   Indeed, Africa has the power. In Ms. Thomas's tales, amissionary's son goes native faster than any heathens turn toChrist. In another story, a skillful carver is exploiting hisforeign customers more than they are exploiting him.   Confronted by Africa, values warp. What was frighteningabout living in Ethiopia, says the heroine of &quot;The JiruRoad,&quot; was &quot;to see how fast you learned to live in the middleof misery as if it were inevitable, even necessary, a part ofthe natural order.&quot;   Ethiopia frames &quot;African Visas&quot; as it did Ms. Thomas'slife. It begins with &quot;The Jiru Road&quot; (1981), which springsfrom Ms. Thomas's Peace Corps days. Haile Selassie is stillon the throne. The famine is still being kept a secret. Thebook concludes with one of the last stories Ms. Thomas wrote,the closely autobiographical &quot;You Are the Sun.&quot; Itscharacters are a handful of Ethiopians and Americans livingin Washington but thinking about Ethiopia. It is years laterand everyone knows the full scale of Ethiopia's disaster: &quot;.. . we had wanted the emperor gone: nothing we all said,nothing could be worse. Nothing. And now, we said, nothingbut this.&quot;   It's a story of guilty knowledge and helplessness. U.S.government experts sit in Washington offices reading reportsof the new famine. &quot;Was it fatalism or frustration these menshared, who are implicated by their knowledge, but innocentin every other way?&quot; the female protagonist asks. She and herhusband are given (as Ms. Thomas was) an opportunity toreturn. And they jump at it (as Ms. Thomas did).   Not surprisingly, with these stories Ms. Thomas set aside,or didn't have time to publish in her lifetime, there are afew rough patches in the writing, places where one morerevision would have made them even better. Still, any newThomas stories are a gift. Soho Press promises there will beeven more.   The autobiographical final story catches the love Ms.Thomas had for Africa despite her clear-eyed witness of itswaste, cruelty and corruption. The Thomas character startsAmharic lessons again with all the enthusiasm that sheremembers from her first, youthful days in Ethiopia.   Despite the knowledge of what Ethiopia has become, she andher husband embrace their new assignment. &quot;The truth is thatwe've both been privately longing to go back, even now, moreso now -- out of curiosity and the tricks we play withourselves about destiny because we all want one.   &quot;We had never intended to go to Africa in the first place:now it's the only place we want to go.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
