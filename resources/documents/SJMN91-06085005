The number is displayedin a small window on the phone console or on a special box that sits besidethe phone.;    Which end are you on?;  Whether you love it or hate it usuallydepends on which end of the phone you envision yourself on.;    On Oct. 1,after five years of preparation, Pacific Bell plans to roll out Caller ID toresidential and small business customers in the San Francisco and Los Angelesareas. On Wednesday, the state Public Utilities Commission will hold the firstof a series of public hearings on the service in San Francisco.;    Also,Pacific Bell is planning a host of new offerings that promise to changepeople's telephone habits, including the ability to return calls withoutknowing the phone number, to block calls from specific numbers and to traceharassing calls for legal action.;    Linchpin of phone technology;  ForPacific Bell, the stakes are high. Caller ID stands to become a major newsource of profit at a time growth from other services is slow. More important,it is the linchpin for a generation of high-tech phone services made possibleby fiber optics and new switching technology.;    Caller ID is spreadingrapidly across the United States. Thirteen states and the District of Columbiaoffer Caller ID. Many more are planning to offer it. In each case, therollouts have sparked intense debate, with both sides waving the privacyflag.;    Supporters argue that the anonymity provided by a phone call is nota right but a drawback that has existed since the telephone's invention in1876. They liken Caller ID to an electronic peephole that would enable peopleto see who's calling them just as they have the right to know who's ringingtheir doorbell.;    &quot;The caller is the intruder,&quot; says Stacey Blazer, founderof People Against Telephone Terrorism and Harassment. &quot;I don't believe thatanonymity is a right. I think I have a right to know who's trying to call me .. . If you have my number, why can't I have yours?&quot;;    Proponents say CallerID could put a substantial dent in the practice of obscene and harassingcalls. About 1 million such calls are reported annually in California, saysPacific Bell, but the actual number is likely to be much higher.;    In NewJersey, the first state to launch Caller ID, requests for traces of abusivecalls dropped 50 percent after Caller ID was introduced. Even people whodidn't subscribe to Caller ID benefited because an obscene phone caller didn'tknow if the victim had the service or not.;    Proponents also argue thatCaller ID would result in a reduction in false alarms and bomb threats. Andthey say it has saved lives in emergency situations where people are eitherunwilling or unable to give their phone number.;    An official at aWashington poison center, for example, testified recently that Caller ID couldhave saved the life of a 2-year-old who swallowed a marijuana cigarette soakedin the drug PCP. The mother called the poison center but refused to give heraddress. With Caller ID, the center could have located the address through theoperator or a reverse phone directory.;    But opponents argue that Caller IDprovides a new tool for telemarketers to get into the home. They fear thatbusinesses will capture phone numbers when people call them and use theinformation for subsequent telemarketing campaigns and consumer research.;   Indeed, some businesses with 800 and 900 numbers, including American Express,already use a related technology, called Automatic Number Identification, thatdisplays the caller's number.;    And opponents argue Caller ID could havemore serious consequences. Certain professions, including psychologists andsocial workers, often call patients from their home and need to protectthemselves if the patient is unstable. Women's shelters have an interest inkeeping their numbers and addresses confidential.;    As a result, critics arepushing phone companies to offer a number-blocking feature that allowscustomers to prevent the display of their phone numbers, like putting theirfinger over the Caller ID peephole. A blocked number would appear on theCaller ID display as &quot;Private&quot; or &quot;P.&quot;;    Number blocking may be done on aper-call or per-line basis. With per-call blocking, which Pacific Bell hasdubbed &quot;per-call privacy,&quot; Touch-Tone customers must dial an extra threedigits, star 67, before the number to prevent the display. With per-lineblocking, no calls from that line would display the phone number, unless thecaller dialed star 67 to unblock the number.;    As the various sides draw thebattle lines, the major dispute in California is expected to be not overwhether to allow Caller ID, but over what is the best way for callers to blocktheir numbers.;    Anticipating the Caller ID furor two years ago, theCalifornia Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Gerald Eaves,D-Rialto, that requires Pacific Bell to offer free per-call blocking to allcustomers. Per-call blocking is available in seven of the 13 states withCaller ID; five states have no blocking.;    Three bills that would requireper-line blocking -- sponsored by Assembly members Gwen Moore and RichardPolanco and state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, all Democrats from Los Angeles --were introduced recently in the Legislature.;    Supporters of per-lineblocking say people will forget to block their numbers despite an extensiveadvertising campaign planned by Pacific Bell to educate customers about thefree option.;    &quot;The mere fact you have to punch in three extra digits seemsa serious denigration of service,&quot; says Ken McEldowney, executive director ofConsumer Action in San Francisco. He says such an inconvenience should be bornonly by those who actively want to send their numbers.;    But Pacific Bellargues, as have other phone companies, that per-line blocking would all butdoom Caller ID. If per-line blocking became a requirement, company executivessay they'd think twice about offering the service.;    In marketing surveys,Pacific Bell has found that a &quot;significant portion&quot; -- 25 percent to 30percent -- of Californians object to Caller ID with no blocking. While 70percent of those people dropped their objection with the per-call blockingfeature, per-line blocking didn't improve acceptance, the company says.;    Itwould hamstring Caller ID, making it virtually useless in most situations,Caller ID supporters say. It also would create confusion for customers whowouldn't know when dialing from a neighbor's or a friend's phone, for example,whether dialing the three digits would block or unblock their call.; IF YOU'REINTERESTED; The California Public Utilities Commission will hold a publichearing on Caller ID at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday at the PUC's auditorium,State Office Building, 505 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco. The hearing is thefirst of six throughout the state but the only one in the Bay Area.
