In the second day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, senators sparred lightly with the 51-year-old federal appeals court judge over a variety of constitutional issues. But Judge Kennedy avoided challenging the current validity of any specific Supreme Court decisions, and was careful to say very little about how he would rule in future cases.    He said the 1966 Supreme Court Miranda decision requiring police to warn persons under arrest of their rights &quot;went to the verge&quot; of what the role of the high court should be, and is &quot;a reminder that courts should confine their rulings to the requirements of the case.&quot; But under questioning by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), he added quickly that the ruling &quot;is in place now and is entitled to great respect.&quot;    Judge Kennedy's answers gave no indication, however, of how he would view future legal efforts, favored by the Reagan administration, to have the high court curtail or throw out the Miranda decision.    In questioning by Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), the committee chairman, the nominee praised the role affirmative action has played in attracting more black students to law school, and said a 1980 Supreme Court decision upholding the allocation of some federal public-works funds for minority contractors gave Congress &quot;sweeping&quot; authority to require affirmative action. But he said he wouldn't discuss how he would approach affirmative action on the high court.    Liberal and conservative senators alike, apparently accepting the inevitability of Judge Kennedy's confirmation next month or in early February, used the hearings to jawbone the nominee over different issues.    Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) said he found Judge Kennedy &quot;vague&quot; in discussing the Ninth Amendment, which says that the listing of some rights in the Constitution shouldn't be read &quot;to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;    The Supreme Court has given little meaning to the Ninth Amendment. But Sen. Humphrey tried, without success, to get assurances that Judge Kennedy shares conservatives' view that the amendment wasn't intended to serve as a vehicle for recognizing new rights. Some liberals say it can serve that purpose. Judge Kennedy described the Ninth Amendment as a &quot;reserve clause.&quot;    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said he was worried that Judge Kennedy has consistently voted against unions and in favor of employers in labor cases. Judge Kennedy replied that &quot;the unions of this country are entitled to full and generous enforcement of the labor laws. . . .&quot; Sen. Metzenbaum said, &quot;Maybe my questions today will make you think about it when you're on the bench.&quot;    The message of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) was on equality. &quot;The question,&quot; he said, &quot;is whether those who are either left out or left behind in the system can look to you to apply equal justice under law.&quot;    On other issues, Judge Kennedy said he considers the presence of television cameras in the courtroom an &quot;outside distraction&quot; that &quot;might make me and my colleagues behave differently.&quot; The Supreme Court has barred cameras because of staunch opposition from Chief Justice Warren Burger. But his retirement last year was thought to have improved the chances of televised court arguments.    Judge Kennedy repeated a statement he made in a speech last summer that he believes the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation ruling was the correct interpretation of the 14th Amendment guarantee of &quot;equal protection.&quot; He said the high court was wrong in an 1896 decision approving &quot;separate, but equal&quot; facilities for blacks.    Judge Kennedy also responded to questions about antitrust law, with Sen. Metzenbaum urging him to consider the impact on consumers, not simply to weigh economic efficiency, as some conservatives advocate.    Judge Kennedy said there is some &quot;utility&quot; to the toughest antitrust standard, under which activities like price-fixing are viewed as inherently anti-competitive and, therefore, illegal. Some antitrust experts have urged that the toughest standard no longer be applied to practices like resale price maintenance, in which a manufacturer sets the retail price for a product. Judge Kennedy said he wouldn't discuss whether he would apply a more lenient standard to resale price maintenance.    Judge Kennedy defended his decision refusing to require Washington state to give state employees equal pay for jobs of &quot;comparable worth.&quot; The 1985 appeals court ruling has been sharply criticized by women's groups that plan to testify against the nomination. They say Judge Kennedy substituted his own view of the job market for the evidence.    A federal judge in Seattle had ruled that the state had discriminated against women employees by paying less for jobs traditionally occupied by women, than for jobs traditionally held by men that require similar levels of skill.    Yesterday, Judge Kennedy said Congress has required equal pay for equal jobs, but that Congress hasn't required equal pay for comparable jobs. &quot;We did not think there was a shred of evidence that the state adopted the pay-scale difference to discriminate against women,&quot; he said.    Elaborating on his position at Monday's hearings that the Constitution does protect privacy, Judge Kennedy said yesterday that there is a right to marital privacy. But he declined to spell out the scope of the right or to discuss the 1965 case in which the Supreme Court first recognized such a right.    The hearings are scheduled to continue today and probably tomorrow with other witnesses, led by the officials of American Bar Association, which has given Judge Kennedy its highest rating. The committee and the full Senate don't plan to vote on the nomination until late January or early February. </TEXT></DOC>
