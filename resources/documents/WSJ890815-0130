The sell-off gathered pace this month when Atlantic Richfield Co. ended a 12-year, $200 million effort to become the world's largest maker of photovoltaic, or solar, panels by agreeing to sell Arco Solar to West Germany's Siemens AG.    Other foreign companies snapping up alternative-energy technologies and companies in the U.S. include Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Tokyo Electric Co., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Sumitomo Corp. Foreign banks and investors have also taken positions in American companies unable to obtain financing in the U.S. In some cases, U.S. concerns have withdrawn from the alternative-energy market.    &quot;It's a national disgrace,&quot; says Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider, ranking minority member on the House natural-resources subcommittee. &quot;There is a vast global market potential for renewable {energy} technology. The U.S. should be in the lead. Instead, we're dragging our feet.&quot;    Prompting the American retreat has been a growing belief that oil prices are unlikely to soar again to the point where alternative fuels become economically viable. Skyrocketing oil prices during the 1973 Arab oil embargo spurred Washington to develop solar, wind, geothermal, fuel-cell and other alternative technologies. But in recent years, fossil-fuel prices have been too low for these alternative-energy sources to compete. Arco, for example, believes the future of solar-electric power is questionable, given that predictions of $50-a-barrel oil in the late 1980s haven't materialized, a spokesman says. Nonetheless, accidents such as Chernobyl and the Exxon Valdez tanker spill, plus fear of ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect, have heightened global concern for the environment -- especially in Europe, where the ecological movement has gained increasing political clout. While it's not certain that such concern will translate into a booming alternative-energy business in the 1990s, foreign interest in commercializing alternative-energy technology is running high.    &quot;The rest of the world is willing to act on its {environmental} concerns, while we wait for a 99.9% confidence level,&quot; says Charles Gay, president of Arco Solar.    Hitachi, for example, isn't worried about today's energy prices. U.S. solar officials say Hitachi doesn't expect its fledgling solar water-heater business to turn a profit for 20 years. West Germany, meanwhile, has a 50-year government program aimed at harnessing the sun that beats down on the Sahara Desert.    But in South Windsor, Conn., International Fuel Cells Corp. -- whose chairman, William Podolny, is considered by many to be the godfather of fuel-cell technology -- doesn't have that luxury of time. (A fuel cell takes natural gas -- or gas from garbage, wood chips and other so-called biomass material -- and efficiently turns it into electricity through a chemical reaction.)    When the Reagan administration cut off International Fuel Cell's research funding in the 1985, United Technologies Corp. -- which owns 89.5% of International Fuel Cells -- wouldn't take up the slack. Neither would any U.S. utility. In 1986, Mr. Podolny turned to Japan's Toshiba, which took a 10.5% equity position, and to Tokyo Electric, which agreed to play host to demonstration projects for the U.S. company's technology.    Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's climate-change division director, John Hoffman, is promoting an industry task force to build momentum for alternative-energy development. But the Department of Energy says there's no federal money for that. At a recent conference in Washington, DOE's deputy assistant secretary for renewable energy, Robert San Martin, acknowledged that Washington needs to be concerned about &quot;very, very difficult {foreign} competition.&quot; But his qualifier -- that DOE &quot;only has so many resources&quot; -- brought derisive laughter from the audience.    U.S. banks also are increasingly reluctant to get involved. When California Energy Co.'s chairman, Charles Condy, went looking for financing for a big geothermal project in 1987, &quot;We couldn't get to first base with any U.S. banks,&quot; he says. &quot;They didn't want to take the risk.&quot; But one day while Mr. Condy was in London, an envelope was left at his hotel. Inside was an offer from Credit Suisse for some $350 million in project financing -- attractive to Mr. Condy because the Swiss bank was willing to make the loan without taking an equity stake. Still, while California Energy is now financially secure, a San Mateo, Calif., competitor, Geothermal Resources International Inc., said in June that four units that own its Coldwater Creek project had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.    &quot;Renewable-energy technology is on the brink of exploding, but a lot of U.S. companies probably won't be around when that happens,&quot; says Susan Williams of Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington, D.C., economic analysis service. Of more than 100 companies profiled in the center's 1986 study of the U.S. alternative-energy industry, 35 have disappeared from a 1989 update. Biggest casualty: the wind-power industry, whose companies had the most trouble coping with the loss, in 1985, of federal tax credits for alternative-energy projects.    Some big U.S. companies have simply dropped out. General Electric Co. has departed both the fuel-cell business and the geothermal-equipment business. Westinghouse Electric Corp., which developed the world's first solar panels for the U.S. space program, also quit solar power several years ago.    Japan, meanwhile, is attacking on all fronts. &quot;I must have a Japanese company a month coming through, offering to buy my company,&quot; says John Corsi, president of Solarex Corp., a maker of solar panels in Rockville, Md. Mr. Corsi adds: &quot;The U.S. is still ahead in photovoltaics, but the rest of the world is gaining. The potential is there for real trouble if we don't get more support from Washington.&quot; Solarex's sales grew 35% in 1988 to about $30 million, with overseas sales accounting for two-thirds of the total, a spokesman says.    Meanwhile, Mitsubishi and Toshiba have provided financing and supplied equipment to the U.S. geothermal market, while Kamata Ltd. and Mitsui andamp; Co. recently acquired 80% of Double Energy Co., a California maker of residential cogeneration units. (Cogeneration produces electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source such as garbage or natural gas. Coupled with a fuel cell, it could someday eliminate the need for utility-supplied electricity, its proponents claim.)    And Nippon Electric Glass Co. and Sanyo Electric Co., have developed what Scott Sklar, the U.S. solar industry's Washington lobbyist, thinks will be among the hottest solar products of the 1990s. Nippon's &quot;smart glass&quot; is an office-building window with an embedded microchip and a photovoltaic-film coating that can automatically darken the glass while at the same time lighting an office. Sanyo's &quot;solar shingles&quot; are like ordinary roofing shingles except they also convert sunlight into electricity, supplying roughly half a home's electrical needs, Sanyo claims.    Japanese and European governments and banks are priming the pump world-wide for alternative energy. Japan has told Mexico it will drill a geothermal field for free if Mexico commits to buying the equipment to put the field into production. Japan also has set up schools in Mali, Kenya and Djibouti to teach the use of solar power to pump water for irrigation.    Denmark is promoting wind power in India, Egypt and Jordan. Sweden and even Syria are pushing biomass projects that turn organic materials into energy. And Germany's Deutsche Bank AG and Britain's Barclays Bank PLC are among the many international banks providing financing for alternative-energy projects.    U.S. alternative-energy advocates mark the start of the U.S. industry's decline to that day in 1981 when President Reagan took down the solar water-heating panels that President Carter had installed atop the White House. &quot;By the year 2000,&quot; says Mr. Sklar, the U.S. solar-industry lobbyist, &quot;I'll still have a job, but all my members will be Japanese and European.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
