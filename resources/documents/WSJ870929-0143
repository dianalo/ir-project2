The steelmaker, a unit of Lukens Inc., said the increases would take effect with shipments on or after Dec. 28. Under the new prices, the base charge for carbon steel plate will rise $25 a ton to $425. In addition, Lukens said it will impose an extra $20-a-ton charge for carbon plate made to special widths and thicknesses.    Steel plate, used for shipbuilding and bridge construction, accounts for about 5% of domestic steel shipments. Supplies of plate have tightened this year as a result of the shutdown of some plate-making plants by other steelmakers.    Unlike other plate-makers, which imposed increases effective next month, Lukens earlier this year froze its prices through the end of the year. A spokesman said the new pricing action reflects recent increases in the cost of alloy metals and scrap steel.    Lukens said its $671-a-ton base price for alloy steel plate, which was set in February 1983, won't be changed. However, the company will raise prices by varying amounts for alloy plate made to special specifications.    Lukens stock closed at $53.75, up $3, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
