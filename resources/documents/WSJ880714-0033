Anthony W. Wang, president of Computer Associates, said because of the antitakeover provisions adopted by Management Science, a hostile takeover &quot;would be a long and probably fruitless fight.&quot; Directors of Management Science, the nation's largest mainframe computer software concern, control 24% of the company's 16.6 million common shares.    Mr. Wang said his company remains interested in combining with Atlanta-based Management Science and would consider increasing its offer if Management Science can show the company is worth more. However, at the moment, &quot;I don't think it makes much sense to be bidding against ourselves,&quot; he said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Management Science's shares fell $2.75, to close at $9.125.    On Tuesday, Management Science shareholders approved proposals that would, among other things, give management broader discretion in accepting or rejecting takeover offers. Holders authorized a new class of preferred stock, and also voted both to limit directors' liability, and to allow management to consider a broad range of factors -- including social and economic issues and the competence and experience of a potential acquirer -- in considering a takeover offer.    Mr. Wang said while he is generally opposed to making a hostile offer for a computer software company, &quot;Every situation has its own nuances.&quot; Although hostile offers for software companies have been successfully completed, he said, companies generally think twice about doing them because a software company's main assets are its people and &quot;in a hostile situation, your assets can walk out the door very quickly.&quot;    A Management Science official said the news came as no surprise. After the proposals were approved by the company's shareholders, the company said it figured the Computer Associates takeover effort was over. </TEXT></DOC>
