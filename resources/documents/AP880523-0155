Last week, the agency said the Toledo Zoo would not be allowedto display the pandas until it could provide the original exportpermit. The zoo, which has scheduled to open the panda exhibitTuesday, was given 10 days to come up with the documentation.   However, USFWS spokesman David Klinger said Monday that lawyersfor the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permitover the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort todeliver the original document.   ``We're not going to stand in the way of them opening theirexhibit this week,'' Klinger said. ``They appear to be making aneffort to deliver the documents. We'll accept that in good faithfrom them as a first step. We'll allow them to open as they want.''   However, Klinger said the zoo still will be required to providethe originals by May 29. Zoo officials have said they have arepresentative in China working on getting the documents to theservice.   Zoo spokeswoman Patty Napierala confirmed that the zoo hadgotten the green light to open the exhibit and plans to do so atnoon Tuesday.   The zoo has spent nearly $3 million in preparing to exhibit thepandas as part of Toledo's 150th anniversary celebration.   In a bid to stop the exhibit, the World Wildlife Fund filed suitagainst the wildlife service, arguing that the exhibit wouldviolate an international convention that bars trafficking inendangered species for commercial purposes.   Klinger said Toledo Zoo officials had sought unsuccessfully tobe exempted from the convention on endangered species and had filedan exemption form with the service instead of the full exportpermit as required.   When the pandas arrived in Chicago on May 13, the paperwork hadnot been corrected. Klinger said the service decided it would bebest for the pandas to allow them to go on to Toledo and to take upthe issue later.</TEXT></DOC>
