Indonesia's coal production increased from 183 thousandtons in 1976 to more than 2,750 thousand tons in 1987. Recent explorationin Central and South Sumatra and in East and Southeastern Kalimantanhas revealed total coal reserves and resources amounting to more than30.5 billion tons. Domestic coal consumption amounted to about 3.0 milliontons in 1987 and is projected to increase to between 10.0-12.0 milliontons in 1993/94. Indonesia is now actively seeking additional and newexport markets for its coal, particularly in east and southeast Asia.The paper briefly summarizes the findings of a study carried out in 1983-84which looked at coal development and utilization prospects in the ASEANregion and discusses the prospects for Indonesian coal exports in thelight of these findings.</TEXT></DOC>
