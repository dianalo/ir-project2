More than 30 people were injured in the fire at the Bronx clubSunday afternoon as 60 to 100 panicked patrons tried to escapethrough the lone exit.   Despite periodic campaigns to close them down, social clubs _ alocal term everyone admits is misleading _ have been centers ofurban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to gambling,prostitution and drug dealing.   Police had raided The Hole five times since March to try to shutit down.   Rife with building, health and fire code violations, the clubsrepeatedly have been the scene of serious fires, including one inBrooklyn three years ago that killed five people.   Such clubs are common in large cities. In 1967 a police raid onan illegal club in Detroit _ ``blind pig'' was the local term _sparked days of rioting.   In New York City, alcohol is sold without a license at more than200 locations, according to estimates by police precinctcommanders. Clubs have operated in the past at another 400locations and could reopen any time.   Some were closed under the city's ``padlock law,'' which allowspolice to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are committedon the site within a 12-month period.   But police have been unable to close many other clubs. The Hole,first raided in May 1984, is a prime example.   Police hit the club five times between March 22 and July 26,seizing cash and liquor and arresting a total of nine people, mostof them employees charged with selling liquor without a statelicense. But the club never stayed closed because the policecouldn't get even the two criminal convictions needed under thepadlock law.   When the fire broke out Sunday most of the cases were stillplodding through the city's overloaded court system. In the threethat were resolved, defendants were allowed to plead guilty todisorderly conduct and pay fines of between $50 and $100.   ``That is useless to us,'' said Deputy Inspector Frank Biehler,because disorderly conduct does not qualify as a criminalconviction under the padlock law.   The fines were particularly puny compared to those prescribedfor violations of the liquor law _ about $10,000 each.   Despite the label, places like The Hole are neither social norclubs.   ``The consumption of alcohol is often of secondary importance,''a state task force report said. ``The primary function of theseoperations has developed into prostitution, gambling, drugs andtrafficking in stolen property.''   City police have made 1,128 arrests at clubs in the past 12months.   New York State liquor licenses cost up to $5,100 and are goodfor three years. But many people do not apply for one, oftenbecause they have a criminal record or plan to employ others who do.   Also, if a bar is not licensed it doesn't have to worry aboutstate inspectors ``coming in and seeing things they don't wantseen,'' said Richard Chernela, spokesman for the state LiquorAuthority.   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term'simplication of exclusivity. An employee usually keeps an eye on thedoor, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a givennight.   Or morning. While the city's licensed bars are required to closeby 4 a.m., social clubs often are open until dawn or later, usuallyto the distress of neighborhood residents.   When the police do stage a raid, securing evidence isproblematic. ``When we come in, a lot of things hit the floor andgo down the toilet,'' Biehler said.   Owners are rarely convicted. ``When you arrest a bartender, youhaven't arrested the guy who's really calling the shots, and so theplace is back in business with a new bartender the next day,''Chernela said.   ``After a tragedy like this everyone looks at the government,but it's a very difficult problem,'' said Chernela. ``You closethem and they just spring back up.''</TEXT></DOC>
