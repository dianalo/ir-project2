Prices for all three grains rose their daily permitted limit, with soybeans passing $9.20 a bushel, several wheat contracts passing $4 a bushel and several corn contracts passing $3 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.    The futures-price increases this week are prompting many analysts to raise their estimates for grain prices. If the hot and dry weather holds through next week, as is expected, some analysts and traders believe soybean and wheat prices will rise shortly to the peak levels set in 1983, the year of the last big drought.    The rising grain prices panicked livestock traders. Grain prices and dry pasture conditions have increased the cost of feeding livestock in some areas by 20% in recent weeks. Some prices of hog and cattle futures plummeted their maximum daily limit yesterday on worries that ranchers will slaughter livestock and glut supermarkets later this summer.    The across-the-board grain rally was sparked by a Midwest storm system that didn't produce as much rain as expected. After the close of trading yesterday, the National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation for much of the Midwest for at least the next six to 10 days.    Prices were also boosted by reports that the low level of the Mississippi River is snarling some barge traffic.    According to some meteorologists, the chances of widespread drenching rainstorms will become less likely as the summer progresses. The topsoil in much of the Midwest is as dry as the 1934 drought, and that helps keep humidity below levels that spark normal summer thunderstorms.    The price of a soybean contract for November delivery settled at $9.255 a bushel, up 30 cents, for a life-of-contract high. During the 1983 drought, the price of the November contract hit $9.60 a bushel.    &quot;November beans have never been this high before this early in the season,&quot; said Daniel Markey, president of Agri Analysis Inc., Chicago. &quot;We have another 40 to 60 days before this thing peaks&quot; if the drought continues, he said.    Yesterday's rally was the second consecutive day that corn-futures prices rose their maximum daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. Under its rules, the Chicago Board of Trade is expanding the price limit and margin requirements for trading in corn contracts for three days beginning today.    If the dry weather holds, the November soybean contract will probably rise the 35 cents a bushel needed to pass the price set during the 1983 drought, said Daniel Basse, an analyst at GNP Commodities Inc., Chicago. &quot;That is likely in several days,&quot; he said.    Wheat futures-prices are also flirting with the highs set during the 1983 drought. Mr. Markey said wheat futures could hit $4.25 a bushel if the drought continues.    Corn-futures prices, however, aren't seen rising to their 1983 drought peak of $3.75 a bushel. Some analysts see corn-futures rising to about $3.25 a bushel within a few weeks.    Among other things, corn prices could be checked by a flood of government-controlled corn that would be unleased on the market as cash prices climb past $3 a bushel. Cash corn prices in much of the Midwest average around $2.40 a bushel.    Under Agriculture Department rules, the agency would stop paying farmers to store corn that is used as collateral for some government loans. This farmer-owned reserve contains roughly 1.4 billion bushels, or about 20% of a normal season's production, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
