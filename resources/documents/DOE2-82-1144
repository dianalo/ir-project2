Sewage gas can be used in gas engines to generateheat or electric power, or in burners if hydrogen sulfides have beenremoved previously. From landfill gas it is moreover necessary to removehalogenated hydrocarbons. To obtain a quality equivalent to natural gas,the separation of carbon dioxide is furthermore required. The paper describesin concise form desulfurization techniques, techniques for removal ofhalogenated hydrocarbons, and for carbon dioxide separation.</TEXT></DOC>
