Carroll   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/06/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B8</SO><CO>   IBM</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. -- International Business MachinesCorp. introduced its long-awaited next generation ofmainframes, in an announcement that stuck pretty close toexpectations.   The most powerful of the new mainframes, which will costas much as $22.8 million, will be available in about a year.IBM, making the announcement at a mainframe facility here,said those machines will be 1.7 to 1.9 times as powerful asits fastest existing machine. IBM executives said theyexpected that increase -- to what consultants say is morethan 210 mips, or million instructions per second -- will letIBM maintain bragging rights as the seller of the fastestmainframe around.</LP><TEXT>   With Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan planning tostart shipping very powerful new generations ofIBM-compatible mainframes at around the same time, though,consultants have said that the race will at least be closerthan ever, and that IBM could for the first time find itselfin second or third place in terms of processing power. IBMhas been losing market share in the mainframe area, fallingfrom its traditional 90% of the IBM-compatible market toaround 80% currently, and any loss of top-gun status for IBMcould help that erosion continue.   While waiting for the most advanced machines in the newSystem 390 family to become available, IBM will sell five&quot;transition&quot; machines. The machines, though labeled as partof the new family, will essentially just repackage the gutsof the existing line in the new, refrigerator-sized cabinets.Those machines, available immediately, also will includefiber-optic channels, which sharply increase the speed atwhich the mainframes can grab data from storage devices andallow those devices to be located as much as six miles fromthe mainframe, compared with a 400-foot limit at the moment.   Frank Gens, a consultant with International Data Corp.,said the prices on the transition machines amount to a 16% to20% price cut off the machines now being sold. That is inline with the normal annual drop in computer prices.   George Conrades, an IBM senior vice president, said inresponse to a question at a news conference that he thinksthe transition models will let IBM move to the new linewithout hurting its revenue or earnings outlook.   &quot;There's no question that in June and July there has beensome pause, but . . . we see a resumption in demand andsupply . . . and would expect to (meet our projections) boththis year and next,&quot; he said.   Some securities analysts have worried that IBM's mainframerevenue will plunge in coming quarters, as customers stopbuying the current technology while they wait for the mostpowerful of the new machines to become available. Manycustomers interviewed in recent weeks have said they plan totake a wait-and-see approach in deciding whether to buy atransition machine or whether just to wait a year for themore powerful machines. &quot;There's really nothing new&quot; in thetransition machines, said Peter J. Daboul, senior vicepresident of information systems services at MassachusettsMutual Life Insurance Co. He added that &quot;we're beginning tosee the mainframe becoming more of a commodity.&quot;   Any disruption in sales would be serious for IBM becauseIBM's mainframes -- together with related peripheral devices,software and maintenance -- account for more than half of itsrevenue and earnings. Partly because of such concerns, IBM'sstock has tumbled from more than $122 in recent weeks;yesterday, it closed at $102.375, down 12.5 cents incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   IBM also announced minicomputers as part of the System 390family that replace two of its current lines -- the venerable4381 and the 9370 family. The comparable machines in the newline run as much as four times as fast as the current 4381sand twice as fast as the 9370s. The ratio of price toperformance is as much as 50% better on the new machines, IBMsaid, and consultants have said they should sell well. Someof the machines are available right away, and all but one areavailable by next March, so these machines could help take upany slack created by any transition problems for their biggerbrothers.   The minicomputers will be able to use the same operatingsystems that control the basic functions of the mainframes,making these machines more of a family and less of ahodgepodge. Using the same operating systems means a customercould take an application, such as a payroll system, and runit on any system from the least powerful in the 390 family upto the most powerful, which is more than 100 times as fast.   IBM also announced versions of two of its big operatingsystems -- VM and VSE -- that will, among other things, letusers write bigger programs and handle larger data bases thanthey can now.   In addition, IBM announced &quot;sysplex&quot; capabilities, whichwill let users lash together as many as eight of the newmainframes in a way that should give them much moreflexibility and access to much more power. At the moment, ifthe mainframe handling, say, an automated teller machine isbusy, someone has to wait to get his cash, even if themainframe's neighbor is sitting idle. Under &quot;sysplex,&quot; thetransaction could automatically be passed to another machine.The increase in available power will become even moreimportant as the decade unfolds if IBM is right that themainframe is moving away from its traditional work ofhandling payroll and accounting and is becoming a &quot;server,&quot;controlling the vast data bases that companies are trying tomake available to employees instantaneously to speed theirability to make decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
