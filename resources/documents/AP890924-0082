Interior Minister Tomas Borge introduced the nominations duringthe daylong convention, and the 1,746 delegates approved thechoices by acclamation.   Ortega, 44, who led the Sandinista National Liberation Front topower with the 1979 overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza, hadbeen expected to win the nomination.   He will run against the opposition coalition candidate, VioletaBarrios de Chamorro, publisher of the newspaper La Prensa, in Feb.25 elections.   There had been uncertainty as to who would take the No. 2 spot,with reports that Ramirez, a 47-year-old lawyer and novelist,wanted to retire from public life. Borge had been mentioned as acandidate for the nomination.   Earlier, the convention approved a 31-page platform promising,among other things, better health care, economic growth and a``respectful accord'' with the United States.   The platform, bearing the title ``Everyting Will Be Better,''was also approved by acclamation, point by point, as these wereread aloud by Bayardo Arce, coordinator of the front.   The platform promises economic growth at an annual rate of 5percent, a halving of the infant mortality of 60 deaths per 1,000births, and expansion of free education.   The Nicaraguan economy, damaged by war and a U.S. economicboycott, has become one of the poorest in Latin America. Anestimated 24 percent of Nicaragua's population of 3.5 millioncannot read or write.   The convention, representing a wide spectrum of society, alsowas to choose 90 candidates for the National Assembly _ thesingle-chamber parliament _ and mayors for 145 municipalities.   President Daniel Ortega moved up the date for the currentelections in return for a regional agreement on Aug. 7 to disbandthe U.S.-supported Contra rebels who have fought to topple hisgovernment since 1981. The Contras are to be disbanded by the endof the year.   There were no surprises in the Sandinista platform, whichpromises to continue the current move toward ``a firm and durablepeace that will cover equally all Nicaraguan families and that willgive us security and tranquility in the future.''   The document says the Sandinista government also seeks a``respectful accord with the government of the United States.''   The United States has been considering how to aid the 14-partyopposition coalition, and the Sandinistas say they expect millionsof dollars to flow to its campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
