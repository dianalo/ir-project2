She spun around Centre Court in jubilation and breathed a deep sigh ofrelief after shaking the chair umpire's hand.;    Yet this was merely thefirst round. Navratilova barely squeaked through, edging 49th-ranked ElnaReinach 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 Tuesday to collect her 100th Wimbledon singles victoryas the tournament began after a one-day rain delay.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NAVRATILOVA PERSEVERES IN WIMBLEDON OPENERAFTER LOSING FIRST SET, SHE DEFEATS REINACH  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Navratilova had not lost a set in the first round at Wimbledon since 1979.In fact, her only first-round loss was in 1974 to Mima Jausovec, 4-6, 6-3,3-6. That's one of only nine defeats at Wimbledon since Navratilova's firstappearance in 1973.;    Reinach, 22, hardly could believe it when she took thefirst set.;    &quot;I thought, she has had many matches and titles on this court,and this is my first time, and I'm giving her a run for her money,&quot; Reinachsaid.;    Navratilova said: &quot;I was all over the place emotionally. I came inthinking, 'I'm really going to enjoy this occasion, defending champion,' andthe next thing I know I lose the first set. I'm in a battle. So I let theoccasion take over the fight. I had to play a match. Believe me, it is notgoing to happen again. That was a bad mistake on my part.&quot;;    The slick, wetcourt bothered her in the first set, and a light sprinkling made conditionsworse. She asked to have the referee inspect the court, but when he failed toappear by the changeover, she went out again.;    Navratilova won 12 of thefinal 13 points to secure the victory.;    &quot;I felt like I was in a final atthe end,&quot; Navratilova said. &quot;My adrenaline was pumping big time. I just won iton emotion. . . . Sure I thought I could lose, but until the last ball washit, I was going to do everything I could to stay out there.&quot;;    Navratilovasaid the pressures of a lawsuit brought by her former companion, Judy Nelson,weren't a distraction.;    &quot;I didn't see the lawyers hitting the balls outthere,&quot; Navratilova said. &quot;I'm out here to play tennis, not to win lawsuits.&quot;;   Defending men's champion Stefan Edberg left for the second straight daywithout a victory, though at least he got onto the court this time. He led6-4, 6-4, 0-1 against Marc Rosset before showers soaked the courts again,forcing a suspension of play.;    John McEnroe, pleased by the gift of 13double faults from Jaime Oncins, survived a slippery outer-court match to win6-1, 6-2, 6-4.; ETC.: Because of the wet weather, only 28 of the 65 scheduledmatches were completed, 23 went unfinished, and 14 never got under way. . . .Chris Evert smoked marijuana and Boris Becker thought of quitting at age 22,according to a new book about the pro tennis tour. An advance copy of JohnFeinstein's book, &quot;Hard Courts,&quot; says Evert came down against smokingmarijuana after trying it on more than one occasion. &quot;It's illegal and it'sdangerous,&quot; the book quotes her as saying. &quot;When I smoked it, it made mebrain-dead. I was out of it completely.&quot; According to the book, Becker'sretirement threat came last year after a conflict with his Romanian manager,Ion Tiriac.;  WIMBLEDON AT A GLANCE; sk,3 TUESDAY'S HIGHLIGHT; Top women'sseed Steffi Graf defeated Sabine Appelmans 6-2, 6-2.
