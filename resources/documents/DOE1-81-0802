O horizon thicknesswas significantly greatest under pine (3.5 cm) and least under mixedhardwoods (2.4 cm). O horizon concentrations of N, P, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn,Si, and Ni had significant differences attributable to vegetation type.A horizon development was quite variable with a mean thickness of 2.3cm. There were significant differences between the A and B horizons fororganic matter content, conductivity, exchangeable acidity, and concentrationsof available N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, Na, Pb, Ti, and Cr. Thedifferences for A and B horizons were not significant for pH, Fe, Si,Al, exchangeable Al, Co, or Ni. There were significant differences amongvegetation types for the ratio of A to B horizon means for pH, exchangeableacidity, conductivity, N, Zn, B, Na, and Ni.</TEXT></DOC>
