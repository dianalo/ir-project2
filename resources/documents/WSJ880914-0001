Trading frequently slows just before the government releases its monthly trade figures, which are notoriously volatile and often lead to upheavals throughout the bond, stock and currency markets. Also scheduled for release today is a Federal Reserve report on industrial production in August.    In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues rose about three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The government's benchmark 30-year bonds yield was 9%, down slightly from 9.03% Monday. Rates also fell slightly on short-term Treasury bills.    Traders said they were reluctant to make major strategy moves in advance of today's trade report. &quot;A lot of people were just flattening up their positions going into the trade report,&quot; said John R. Burrus, president and chief executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd. in New York.    The report is widely expected to show the nation's deficit narrowed in July from June's $12.54 billion. Most estimates for July hover around $11.5 billion. But Mr. Burrus and many other traders agree that the bond market's reaction will depend not only on the overall trade gap but also on the details of exports and imports.    William Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said a trade deficit below $10 billion probably would spark a rally in bond prices while a gap higher than $13 billion would likely generate selling. &quot;The best of all possible worlds are when exports are up and imports are down,&quot; he said. &quot;That would show a slowdown in consumption,&quot; a development that would ease inflation fears, he said.    Treasury Secretary-designate Nicholas Brady said yesterday he expects the U.S. trade deficit will decline at a &quot;surprisingly fast&quot; pace over the next couple of years as a result of the dollar's depreciation. He didn't give details, but some traders interpreted his remarks as a clue that today's report will show a lower trade gap.    The industrial production report will show no change from July, according to the average estimate of 12 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. That would follow a vigorous 0.8% increase in July.    Several recent government reports, especially the August employment figures, have indicated to many economists that the economy's growth slowed last month and that interest rates won't rise any further. But Joseph T. DeAngelis, director of fixed-income investments for Chemical Investment Management Co., disagrees.    &quot;We believe rates will move higher as the year progresses,&quot; said Mr. DeAngelis, whose firm manages about $3 billion of fixed-income assets. He expects the economy to continue expanding at a brisk pace, with long-term Treasury bond yields increasing by about a percentage point before year end to 10%.    Treasury Securities   The rally in Treasury bond prices yesterday wiped out most of Monday's declines.    The government's latest 30-year issue, which fell about half a point Monday, rose 3/8 of a point yesterday to 101 9/32.    The latest 10-year issue rose to 102 5/32 from 101 30/32, while its yield dipped to 8.92% from 8.95%.    The yield on the latest two-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 8.38% from 8.41% Monday. The yield on Treasury notes due in about five years dipped to 8.63% from 8.67%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., rose 3.09 points to 1244.35. It finished slightly below its high for the day of 1245.05. The low was 1239.62.    Treasury bill rates also declined. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills dipped to 7.17% bid from an average of 7.21% at Monday's auction by the government. The latest six-month bill rate declined to 7.40% bid from Monday's auction average of 7.41%.    One-year Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at 7.46% bid, down from 7.51% Monday.    Foreign Bonds   Japanese government bond prices rose as the yen advanced in the currency markets.    Canadian and British government bonds also gained, but West German issues drifted lower.    The yen's advance against the dollar helped spark the Japanese bond market rally. Also helping bolster bond prices was a Japanese government report showing wholesale prices edged up only 0.1% in August from July -- and still are down 1% from a year ago.    Traders said the news provided further evidence that inflation remains well under control and thus eased pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. The benchmark government bonds, the No. 105, 5% issue due 1997, closed at a price of 99.21, up 0.31 in the interdealer market, to yield 5.125%.    Canadian government bonds rose in brisk activity, outperforming comparable U.S. Treasury issues. &quot;We saw very, very good volume,&quot; said Alberto Franco of Salomon Brothers Inc. He said much of the buying came from U.S. investors attracted by the recent widening in the difference between yields on Canadian government issues and on U.S. Treasurys.    Also, the Canadian dollar's improvement in the currency markets helped bolster Canadian bond prices, Mr. Franco said.    The government's benchmark 10-year issue rose 1/2 point to 100 3/4. The yield fell to 10.13%, or 1.22 percentage point above comparable U.S. Treasury notes, from 10.21% Monday.    In London, British government prices ended slightly higher, but the market remained nervous ahead of the release of the U.S. trade data today.    Dealers attributed early gains largely to buying by Tokyo and European investors attracted by the continued high yields that gilts offer compared with most other government bond markets and by the pound's steady performance in the currency markets.    But buying evaporated later in the day, traders said. &quot;Retail was totally absent,&quot; said Richard Warley-Cummings, head trader at Chase Manhattan Securities.    Late in the day, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 was up 2/32 to 113 25/32 to yield 9.92%. The government's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was up 5/32 to 102 6/32 to yield 10.62%, while the 12% issue due 1995 was up 7/32 to 106 31/32 to yield 10.46%.    In West Germany, prices slipped after almost two weeks of steady gains. The West German government's 6 3/4% issue due July 1998 ended 0.15 point lower at 100.55 to yield 6.668%. Euromark bonds ended 0.25 to 0.40 point lower.    Separately, the Association of German Stock Exchanges said that starting Oct. 3, 26 of the most liquid West German government bonds will be traded continuously during regular stock exchange hours.    The new system replaces the current practice of trading bonds only for the purpose of setting a fixed price. The move is seen as a prelude to the trading of mark interest rate futures, set to begin next year.    Municipals Issues   Municipal bonds were largely unchanged after a session of trading in very narrow ranges, with the market's focus squarely on today's trade report.    The New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds of 2018 finished unchanged on the day at 92 3/8, bid, having wavered within a 1/8-point channel over the course of the session. The bonds yield about 7.86%.    Activity picked up in the new-issue market, where over $616 million in new bonds from issues over $50 million apiece were priced.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bonds ended little changed on the day, after an uneventful session dominated by dealer and investor position-squaring before today's report on the July U.S. merchandise trade balance.    &quot;We were pretty much in a holding pattern,&quot; says one trader. &quot;There wasn't much trading. Everyone's waiting for the number.&quot;    Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report are expecting a seasonally adjusted $11.2 billion July trade gap, down from $12.54 billion in June.    Separately, traders say there was a failed auction for $62.5 million Kroger Co. dutch auction rate preferred stock, underwritten by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    In a dutch auction, investors bid for the rate they want to receive. In a failed auction, there are what one underwriter termed &quot;insufficient clearing bids.&quot;    According to market observers, the rate for the preferred stock was set at 9.891%, equal to 120% of the commercial paper rate. The level was the maximum permissable rate under the offering guidelines, traders say.    Market participants attributed the stymied auction to the company's announcement earlier Tuesday that its directors are exploring a possible restructuring.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities ended 1/8 to 1/4 point higher after light dealings.    Ginnie Mae 10% securities for September delivery were quoted at 100 13/32, up 7/32; 9% securities at 94 3/4, up 8/32, and Freddie Mac 10% securities at 99 31/32, up 7/32.    The Ginnie Mae 10% issues were yielding 10.06% to a 12-year average life, as the spread above the 10-year Treaasury note tightened four basis points to 114 basis points.    Trading in derivative markets also was quiet after a spurt of activity last week, when a large number of new offerings were made. No new Remic offerings were made Tuesday. Remics are real estate mortgage investment conduits.    Last week's new-issue business included $2 billion of Remics, $1 billion of securities backed by credit-card receivables, $472 million of certificates backed by automobile loans and $200 million of stripped mortgage securities. </TEXT></DOC>
