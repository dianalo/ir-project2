John Snow, CSX's president and chief operating officer, told analysts here that he would explore changes to make the plan more attractive to the United Transportation Union, which voted last week not to participate. &quot;We don't think this is the end of the initiative by any means,&quot; said Mr. Snow, adding: &quot;We'll continue to pursue gain-sharing with CSX's rail unions.&quot;    Under the proposed program CSX, a Richmond, Va.-based transportation and natural-resources company, would slash its rail work force by more than 10,000 jobs, or about 25%. The company then would share half the estimated $450 million a year in savings with the remaining employees in the form of annual bonuses.    But Fred Hardin, president of the Cleveland-based UTU, said CSX and the union were still &quot;a long, long way apart.&quot; The proposed program would have &quot;involved hundreds of changes in work rules that we've had for 50 to 100 years,&quot; he said. &quot;It was unacceptable to UTU employees&quot; because, he said, the union was asked to make greater job sacrifices than the other unions without a proportionate share of the savings. </TEXT></DOC>
