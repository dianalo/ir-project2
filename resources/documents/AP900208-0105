Except for Romania, all East bloc countries followed Moscow inbreaking diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967 following theMiddle East War, when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Stripfrom Egypt and Jordan.   Now that Eastern European countries are breaking away fromMoscow, they are eager to restore diplomatic ties with the Jewishstate.   Arens is expected to sign an agreement on resuming relationswith his Czechoslovak counterpart, Jiri Dienstbier.   After Israel was established in 1948, Czechoslovakia was one ofits earliest and most enthusiastic backers, training Israeli airforce pilots and supplying weapons for its fight against the Arabs.   In later years, like the other East bloc Communist countriesunder the sway of Moscow, Czechoslovakia gave far more support tothe Arabs.   Vaclav Havel, who became Czechoslovakia's president after thepro-democracy movement that drove out the hard-line Communistleadership, has said he recognizes the right of the Palestinians totheir own state, while understanding the anxiety of Israel based on``years of painful experience.'' Havel has offered to mediate intalks between Israel and the PLO.</TEXT></DOC>
