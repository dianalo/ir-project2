Donovan and his lawyers say the legal fees and expenses are forthe period March 1987 through October 1987 in connection with theprobe by independent counsel Leon Silverman.   The information was released Friday by a special three-memberpanel of appeals court judges which appointed Silverman.   Federal law on independent counsels provides for the governmentto pay legal fees if the subject of the criminal investigationisn't indicted.   William Bittman, another partner, seven associates and threeparalegals of the law firm Pierson, Ball and Dowd provided legalservices and incurred expenses totaling $79,228 said theapplication. Paul Curran, four associates and one paralegal of thefirm Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler are seeking $33,052in fees and expenses.   Donovan was cleared in the probe of accusations that he may havelied when he denied knowing anything about the alleged kickbackscheme which involved a former supplier of Schiavone ConstructionCo. where Donovan was working at the time.   Silverman concluded that although there was ``some evidence tosupport an indictment,'' a conviction is ``unlikely'' and charges``not warranted.''   One witness in the probe was elderly, ailing and had a failingmemory, said Silverman, while another was a convicted felonawaiting sentencing who had given inconsistent statements.</TEXT></DOC>
