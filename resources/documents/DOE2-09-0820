Totalairborne welding-fume concentrations collected near welders ranged from0.7 mg/m{sup 3} to 6.2 mg/m{sup 3}. Concentrations of nickel ranged from0.001 to 0.022 mg/m{sup 3}. Silver was detected in only one sample. Airborne-asbestosconcentrations were below the limit of detection. Analysis of brake shoeshavings showed that they contained 10 to 20% chrysotile asbestos. Theauthors conclude that there is a health hazard from exposure to weldingfume, and that a potential for exposure to asbestos exists in the brakeshoe machining area. The authors recommend improvements in ventilation,use of respiratory protective equipment, and engineering controls.</TEXT></DOC>
