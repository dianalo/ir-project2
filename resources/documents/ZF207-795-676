 Here, we lookat updates of OmniPage and TextPert and a newcomer, AutoREAD.andP;  Together withAccuText from Xerox Imaging Systems/Datacopy and ReadStar II Plus fromInovatic, these programs comprise the high end of the OCR market.andM;OmniPage 2.0.andP;  Most obvious among the changes in Los Gatos, Calif.-basedCaere Corp.'s OmniPage 2.0 are the ability to read foreign characters and theability to process pages in landscape orientation.andP;  The text window nowpermits some editing, and more formatting can be retained.andP;  Menus have beenslightly reorganized, more scanners are supported, on-line help has beenadded, and the manuals have been rewritten.andM;Some features, however, could still use improvement.andP;  For example, Caereoffers only three contrast settings, while most other OCR packages have aslide control for better precision.andP;  Caere itself notes in the manual, &quot;TheContrast setting is the most important means you have to affect the accuracyof an OmniPage translation.&quot; Proving our point, we took a page OmniPage didnot handle acceptably and scanned it with another OCR product, fine-tuned thescan contrast, then saved the resultant image to disk.andP;  We opened this TIFF(tag image file format) file from disk with OmniPage and processed it withvery good results.andM;Another feature we consider a must is an automatic enlarged view of scanneddocuments to judge their suitability for OCR work.andP;  Other OCR products havethis feature.andP;  While it is possible to get an enlarged view in OmniPage, itis more of an afterthought than a preview.andP;  It is available only through thePartial Page, Fine Adjust and Actual Size settings, none of which aredefaults.andM;There is no manual override to OmniPage's automatic page definition, in whichit automatically parses a page; removes graphics; and divides it intomultiple columns, headlines and footnotes.andP;  On the whole, it is quite good atthis, but occasionally it removes page numbers, mistaking them for dirt, orit joins text blocks inaccurately.andP;  If this happens, the only way to correctthings is to scan the document in multiple passes, defining each appropriaterectangle of text as a &quot;partial page.&quot;andM;We would like to see OmniPage include &quot;expert&quot; tools similar to those foundin competitors' software.andP;  If the people at Caere believe these may be toointimidating for average users, they could use optional extended menus, asfound in AccuText.andM;While some U.S.andP;  OmniPage users will appreciate the program's newly foundability to read foreign characters, the capability is more important inCaere's development of the overseas market.andP;  Localized versions are beingprepared.andP;  Any combination of 11 European language sets can be used, but themore options chosen, the slower the program will run and the more mistakes itwill make.andP;  We found OmniPage's performance in the foreign languages wetested (Spanish and French) equal to its performance in English.andM;Perhaps it would be best to leave OmniPage's new format retention featureunselected.andP;  We found the program sometimes missed italics or bold and atother times put them where they didn't belong.andP;  Its ability to retainjustification was equally unimpressive.andP;  In our tests, center justificationwas rarely retained accurately, and indentation was never the same number ofspaces as the original.andM;The general elegance of the manual is marred by the use of some poor-qualitygraphics, and once again, we wish there were a section on advanced topics.andO;The toll-free tech support phones are staffed by people with a programmer'slevel of understanding of the package.andP;  They are friendly and helpful.andM;When it is good, it is very, very good.andP;  Speed and accuracy are the twoprinciple measures of OCR efficiency.andP;  On straightforward material, OmniPageis among the fastest and most accurate OCR products on the Macintosh.andP;  Inmany situations, experienced users may find Version 2.0 a bit slower becauseof a new internal review of questionable characters.andM;Veteran users will be pleased to hear OmniPage is much faster at dealing withdifficult material.andP;  With Version 1.0, if the software was having a difficulttime with a page, it would ponder for interminable lengths of time, even ahalf hour or more on a single page.andP;  The only way to get it to quit was toturn off the machine.andP;  Now, not only is there a Cancel command, OmniPage willautomatically use the &quot;unrecognized character&quot; mark and move on after acertain length of time.andM;These improvements in handling, together with its new features, make OmniPageeven more attractive than before.andP;  But you will still need a large amount ofOCR work to justify the investment in hardware and software.andM;TextPert.andP;  TextPert 3.01 from CTA Inc. of New York attempts to join the bestof both worlds: trainable and automatic font recognition.andP;  TextPert now hasan internal library that CTA claims will read most documents without the needfor font training.andM;In tests, we found TextPert's automatic capabilities tantalizingly good, butnot good enough to compete with the likes of OmniPage or AccuText.andP;  Perhapswith Version 4.0, we will finally see the ideal product in which mostdocuments will be read automatically, but if the software is having problemswith a character or two, the user can quickly touch up the identification.andM;Teaching TextPert a new font is a remarkably easy job.andP;  Actually, you willusually teach TextPert all the fonts for a particular project at the sametime, including them all in a single template.andP;  In TextPert 3.0, seldom morethan one or two examples of each character in a single font are retained inthe template, which is easily viewed and corrected.andM;Universal font.andP;  For versatility in reading foreign languages, TextPert isclearly the product of choice.andP;  Not only can the user choose between thecharacter sets of 31 European languages (or any combination), the user canalso choose between four alphabets: Roman, Greek, Cyrillic and Hebrew.andP;  Allcharacter sets can be edited, and it is even possible to build your own.andM;Scanner controls are good, and most popular scanners are supported.andP;  Pagedefinition is automatic with manual override.andP;  We found the automatic modeunreliable, occasionally leaving out an entire line between two text blocks.andM;Double-clicking on a text block brings up a dialog box that allows elaborateformatting.andP;  Carriage returns can be added or removed at the end of eachline.andP;  Any character can be set to start or end a text block.andP;  A block can betagged as a financial table, while the blocks above and below it are stillread as conventional text.andP;  Other formatting choices allow easy export ofmaterial to databases or spreadsheets.andM;When working with a learned font, speed and accuracy are good.andP;  For instance,we processed six pages from a novel in Spanish with less than five errors perthousand characters, at a speed noticeably slower than OmniPage, but quiteacceptable.andP;  However, in repeated tries with different material, we wereunable to teach TextPert to read the Spanish accented &quot;i.&quot; We have noexplanation for this apparent anomaly.andM;TextPert retains formatting with some unusual twists.andP;  It retains bold anditalics, but not underline.andP;  While it reads underlined text fairly well, if acharacter, such as a &quot;p,&quot; actually touches the underline, it replaces thecharacter with a space.andP;  No justification is retained, but font size isrecognized, although not always accurately.andM;Another nice feature of TextPert 3.0 certain to be adopted by thecompetition, is its attempt to recognize typefaces and retain thisinformation in the output word processing file.andP;  Optionally, it will includetypesetter's tags for typeface, size, style and indent in the file.andP;  We foundneither of these features especially accurate, but probably useful in volumeOCR work even in this initial form.andP;  TextPert is also unique among major MacOCR products in allowing font and style editing within the program.andM;Tech support personnel in the United States, reachable by a toll-free number,called us back within 48 hours and provided informed, friendly service.andP;  Theattractive manual is much more readable than the previous versions.andP;  TextPertwill work normally on a 2-Mbyte Mac and in the background under MultiFinderon a larger one.andM;We continue to find TextPert a highly innovative product, although theexecution is not always up to the design.andM;AutoREAD.andP;  AutoREAD 1.2 from Tutorland of Cupertino, Calif., is a trainableOCR program.andP;  It will work on any Mac with 2 Mbytes of RAM and works withscanners from Apple, Agfa, Hewlett-Packard and Microtek.andP;  It can read andsave TIFF files.andP;  Text can be saved in ASCII format only.andP;  It iscopy-protected with a key disk.andM;While learning to use the program, our sensibilities frequently were jarredby eccentric uses of the English language and the Macintosh interface.andP;  Underthe File menu, in addition to the expected choices, we found the controls forthe scanner.andP;  Under another menu, we were offered the opportunity to changethe &quot;unrecognized character.&quot;andM;Rather than containing a list of fonts, as you would expect, the Font menucontains choices for saving and editing font tables.andP;  The Visual menu turnedout to contain choices associated with the Window menu in other Macintoshprograms.andP;  The final choice in this menu is &quot;(C)1988 ITSC.&quot; The manualexplains that choosing this should toggle between the two principle windowsof AutoREAD.andP;  We found it did nothing.andM;The text output window lacks a close box.andP;  The only way to remove text is viathe Clear Menu command, the only hierarchical menu command in the program.andO;The hierarchical choice is Confirm! These do not seem examples of Macprogramming at its best.andM;Teaching the program a new font and using it to read documents was easier andmore effective than we had come to expect.andP;  That is not to say itsperformance is equal to the competition.andP;  Compared with the other twoproducts in this review, AutoREAD is rather primitive.andM;It does not measure up to the competition in terms of speed, accuracy, rangeof material it can handle or ease of use.andP;  It is minimally marketed withlimited tech support (albeit through a toll-free number), comes with a modestmanual and is copy-protected.andP;  While two years ago AutoREAD would haveappeared more competitive, today it lags behind other entries in the OCRmarket.andP;  nandM;The high end of Macintosh optical character recognition is experiencing realcompetition among several standard-setting products.andP;  OmniPage 2.0 andTextPert 3.01 are updates to leaders in this race, and AutoREAD 1.2 is a newplayer (in the U.S.andP;  market) priced against the best.andM;We found, however, that the only thing high end about AutoREAD was its price.andO;The software cannot perform automatic recognition and is burdened with anawkward interface.andP;  AutoREAD's basic OCR capabilities are slower and lessaccurate than the other packages in its price range.andP;  In addition, theapplication is copy-protected.andM;The updates to OmniPage and TextPert, on the other hand, push the limits ofboth fully automatic and automatic/trainable OCR.andP;  Both handle foreignlanguages (TextPert is slower, but more flexible and accurate), and both trywith mixed success to read character formatting in addition to recognition.andM;While the newest features in these packages have predictably rough edges,their basic function of recognizing letters on a page quickly and reliablyhas gotten better.andP;  OmniPage is faster than before, and TextPert reduces thedifficulty of training to an all-time low.andP;  Taken in the context of Xerox'sexcellent OCR product, AccuText, these updates keep the competition fierce.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
