MoserandM;SEATTLE -- With new President and CEO Jack Noonan at the helm, Microrim Inc.andO;is now steering resources to its existing product arsenal rather thanfocusing on long-term goals.andM;At last week's Microrim Developers Conference here, Noonan emphasizedMicrorim's commitment to evolve its mainstay -- the R:base database -- givingless priority to technology-driven, visionary projects such as thelong-awaited and much-delayed Vanguard multiplatform database.andP;  Vanguard is&quot;alive and well,&quot; Noonan stressed, but the original design has been scaledback to a more manageable project, he said.andM;As part of this strategy, Microrim plans to offer improved, but lessexpensive, technical support (see chart below), and has put off plans todevelop its own compiler for R:base 3.1, Noonan said.andM;Another area of concentration for Microrim is to revamp the R:base ProgramInterface (PI) to support additional R:base 3.1 commands.andP;  Similar to BorlandInternational Inc.'s Paradox Engine, the PI is a library of core R:basedatabase functions that developers can tap to write applications in C,FORTRAN or assembler.andM;Microrim has hired an outside contractor to design the PI upgrade.andP;  Pricingand availability have not yet been set, Noonan said.andM;Also announced at the conference was R:Scope, a $129 package of developmenttools used to maintain databases and fix errors.andP;  The tool kit, availablenow, includes a utility that identifies and corrects broken databasepointers, a re-indexing module and other features for troubleshooting as wellas preventing data loss and corruption.andM;Instead of developing a compiler for R:base 3.1, Microrim plans to boost thespeed and reduce the size of the R:base run-time module to addressdevelopers' demands for smaller and faster solutions.andM;Some developers were disappointed with the news.andP;  &quot;To me, it contradicts thestatement that they are listening to what the [R:base] community wants,&quot; saidShirley McGrath, president of Dragon Fly Enterprises Ltd., an independentdatabase consulting firm in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.andM;&quot;The [R:base] run-time has its limits -- the backup feature is not there forbacking up and restoring,&quot; and the product lacks the much-needed Table andView commands, she said.andM;Long-time R:base user Lien Tran, a systems analyst and programmer for theUniversity of Washington's Continuing Education Division in Seattle, isreconsidering the R:base 3.1 upgrade because of its lack of compiler support.andM;Noonan said Microrim would entertain offers from third parties interested inwriting an R:base 3.1 compiler.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
