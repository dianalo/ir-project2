He said it would be nearlyimpossible to raise the money needed for the buyout, especially inlight of Pan Am's tottering finances.   A Waterloo-based investment group proposes to sell at least300,000 bonds in $5,000 denominations to buy Pan Am, according toPan Am airline Capt. Neil Sapp, 51, of Miami. That would beequivalent to borrowing half the annual state budget for Iowa.   Speaking Tuesday in Waterloo at a luncheon attended by 175northeast Iowa business and government officials, Sapp said theeffort should not be taken lightly.   ``We would like to make a solid offer in January,'' he said.``We're not crazy; we're just innovative.''   Sapp and Samual Nodarse of Cedar Falls, a retired University ofNorthern Iowa professor, formed the Iowa Acquisition Group and saidthey would buy the company on condition that its headquarters movefrom New York to Waterloo.   ``We're the white hats, the good guys,'' Sapp said. ``We're notjust someone who wants to buy it for its assets, then run away fromit with the profits from that.''   He said money raised through the sale of bonds would be investedwith Iowa banks, primarily in certificates of deposit, with theinterest used to pay off loans from investment bankers. Investorswould get interest when bonds mature in nine years.   Sapp predicted a ``very high probability of success.''   Spokeswoman Pam Hanlon at Pan Am's headquarters in New York saidcompany policy is to decline comment on reports of mergers andacquisitions. Industry analysts disagreed with Sapp's prediction.   ``In today's market, it would be difficult to raise that kind ofmoney for an airline like Pan Am,'' Decker. ``We're in a periodwhere debt markets are cautious and conservative.   ``There's not a lot of funds available nd Pan Am wouldcertainly be a high risk company to do a buyout on at this stage.''he said.   Thomas Canning, who follows airlines for Standard andamp; Poors Corp.in New York, said, ``Selling the bonds might be difficult. And Idon't know what Pan Am might say about it. They've been looking fora buyer for two years and have not been able to make a deal.   ``I don't want to say there's no chance, but it's a littlewild,'' Canning said. ``It's been difficult finding somebodyinterested in buying the whole company.''   Pan Am has been losing money for years. It recently agreed tosell key London routes and some other assets to Chicago-based UALCorp., parent of United Airlines, for $400 million.</TEXT></DOC>
