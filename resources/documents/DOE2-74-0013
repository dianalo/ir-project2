The diversification of their businessis anatural outcome of the characteristics as are inprivate businesses.They can reduce charges and supply costs by operating byworks and compensatethe total costs. Dissimilar to railways and telecommunications, the operationaldiversification is restricted as the range of byworks admitted for thepower utility is limited and the investment is controlled by administrativeinstruction. By reviewing the results of multi-field operation of otherenterprises, it is expected that the power utility can improve theirperformance by enlarging their business fields. For the purpose, regulationson the byworks should be more flexible and requests for the deregulationin increasing. It should be pointed out, however, that they shall notgo out of the framework of power utility so far by such multiple fieldoperation. (8 figs, 10 tabs, 26 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
