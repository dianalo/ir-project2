Four loci have been designated nodF,nodE, nodG and nodH. The correlation of transposon insertion positionswith phenotypes and open reading frames was confirmed by sequencing theinsertion junctions of the transposons. The protein products of thesenod genes were visualized by in vitro expression of cloned DNA segmentsin a R. meliloti transcription-translation system. In addition, the sequencefor nodG was substantiated by creating translational fusions in all threereading frames at several points in the sequence; the resulting fusionswere expressed in vitro in both E. coli and R. meliloti transcription-translationsystems. A DNA segment bearing several open reading frames downstreamof nodG corresponds to the putative nod gene mutated in strain nod-216.The transcription start sites of nodF and nodH were mapped by primerextension of RNA from cells induced with the plant flavone, luteolin.Initiation of transcription occurs approximately 25 bp downstream fromthe conserved sequence designated the nod box, suggesting that this conservedsequence acts as an upstream regulator of inducible nod gene expression.Its distance from the transcription start site is more suggestive ofan activator binding site rather than an RNA polymerase binding site.</TEXT></DOC>
