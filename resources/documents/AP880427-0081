Bush, who captured enough delegates in the Pennsylvania primaryto clinch the Republican nomination, recently has focused hisattacks on Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee after big wins inWisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania.   The vice president has charged that the Massachusetts governorlacks the experience in foreign policy to run the nation.   Dukakis said, ``It's not how much time you spent living inWashington that makes the difference. It's your values, it's thequality of the people you pick, your ability to work with theCongress and the American people, to shape a foreign policy thatreflects our foreign policy and principles.''   Dukakis said if he won the nomination, he would debate Bush onthose issues. Bush said today he would ask Dukakis what theDemocrat would do about the hostages and about keeping Persian Gulfsea lanes open.   On Tuesday night, Dukakis refused to claim the nominationalthough he scored a better than 2-1 win over rival Jesse Jacksonand widened his delegate lead.   ``I'm in every single primary and I'm going to be campaigning inevery single primary,'' he said.   ``I want to say thank you to the people of Pennsylvania for aterrific victory,'' he told reporters.   The Massachusetts governor would not say he has clinched thenomination.   ``Remember, I am someone people are just getting to know,'' hesaid.   But with the major victory, Dukakis faced a new barrage ofquestions about his choice for the vice presidential spot. Dukakisrepeated his claim of not worrying about that until the primariesend June 7.   However, he talked about potential running mates, saying hewould consider Jackson as well as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.   Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, hasbeen frequently mentioned as a possible No. 2. Dukakis said that'spossible.   ``He is certainly somebody who ought to be considered by thenominee,'' Dukakis said.   He repeated his stance that Jackson should be considered as apossible vice presidential choice: ``Sure, I wouldn't rule himout.''   CBS News said it talked to Democratic party officials in 46states for their choice for the second spot on the ticket. A totalof 22 named Nunn and five name Sen. Albert Gore Jr.   Asked if he would give a vice president a Cabinet post _ as somehave suggested for Nunn _ Dukakis did not answer directly.   `I am someone ... who has always involved my lieutenant governoractively in my administration and given that person realresponsibility ... and I would expect to do the same (aspresident),'' Dukakis said.   ``The first and most important criterion is that that person canbe a first-rate president if something happens to the president.... Pick that kind of person and I have no doubt there will be veryimportant responsibilities,'' he said.   Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, Dukakisrefused to claim the crown yet, referring to Democratic nomineeWalter Mondale's problems in 1984.   ``I reminded many of you that Fritz Mondale won New York andPennsylvania and then lost a whole string of primaries,'' heexplained.   ``I'll be campaigning just as hard and just a vigorously'' inthe primaries to come, he said. ``We're going to work very hard towin every one of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
