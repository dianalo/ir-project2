Under the new Canadian rules, effective last Friday, all refugee claimants from the U.S. are being turned back to the U.S. until their claims can be heard by a Canadian immigration panel. A policy that allowed people from 18 strife-ridden countries, including Guatemala and El Salvador, to stay and work in Canada was canceled.    Immigration Minister Benoit Bouchard said the new measures are designed to stop abuse of Canada's &quot;generous refugee practices.&quot; Previously, Canada allowed most people seeking refugee status from within its borders to stay in Canada until the claim could be heard.    Since January, 6,000 people came to Canada to make refugee claims, one-third the number for all of 1986. Almost half the claims made within Canada so far this year were by Guatemalans and Salvadorans who had been living illegally in the U.S. The influx has strained Canadian immigration facilities at the Quebec-U.S. border and social services in Quebec province.    In November, the U.S. offered amnesty to illegal immigrants who had lived continuously in the U.S. since before Jan. 1, 1982, but increased the threat of deportation for those who arrived after that date. Mr. Bouchard said the U.S. agreed not to deport illegal immigrants who apply for refugee status in Canada and are awaiting a Canadian immigration hearing.    Canada hopes its new policy will encourage people residing illegally in the U.S. to claim refugee status at Canadian embassies and consulates in the U.S., where they will be judged on a case-by-case basis, rather than at the border.    Several groups representing refugees, including the Inter-Church Committee for Refugees, in Toronto criticized the Canadian government's measures as callous.    U.S. border towns such as Plattsburgh, N.Y., have had trouble accommodating the few people turned back at the border since December to wait for a Canadian immigration hearing. Those people were from countries other than the 18 exempt nations. More people are expected to be turned back under the new Canadian policy.    Mr. Bouchard said the measures would reduce total refugee claims within Canada this year to an estimated 25,000, compared with a projected 50,000 without the changes. Canada will continue to &quot;provide asylum to every genuine refugee who lands in Canada,&quot; Mr. Bouchard said. In addition to claims made inside its borders, Canada accepted 16,000 refugees from abroad last year. Total immigration was 100,000; Canada's population is about 22 million.    Since July, Canada has imposed visa requirements on citizens from Portugal and Turkey to discourage planeloads of Turkish and Portuguese citizens who sought refugee status at Canadian airports. Many of them had been counseled by &quot;unscrupulous travel consultants&quot; on ways &quot;to circumvent Canadian immigration policy,&quot; the government said.    Meanwhile, another group of Sri Lankans is reportedly preparing to sail for Canada from West German refugee camps. Last August, 155 Sri Lankans traveled by ship from West Germany to the coast of Newfoundland, where they were cast off in lifeboats. Sri Lanka was one of the countries to which nationals weren't deported, and all the castaways were permitted to stay.    Mr. Bouchard said that under the new policy, similar claimants would be considered individually, and &quot;they wouldn't automatically be given work or permits&quot; to stay in Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
