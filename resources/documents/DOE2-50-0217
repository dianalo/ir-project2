<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0217 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since 1960, the Potential Gas Committee (PGC) has prepared periodic estimatesof the undeveloped and undiscovered natural gas resource potential remainingin the US. In preparing its estimates, the PGC uses available informationregarding past discoveries and production of natural gas as well as geologicand engineering data about prospective geologic provinces. Three categoriesof estimates are made. First, probable supply is associated with discoveredfields and represents the remaining gas that could be developed and producedwith additional drilling and field development. The estimate of probablesupply is based on extrapolation of characteristics of the previouslydeveloped parts of the field. Second, possible supply is related to projectionsof additional new fields that are anticipated to be amenable to discoveryduring the continued exploration within provinces and trends that arealready established as productive. The estimate of possible supply isbased on analysis of the geologic characteristics of the undevelopedpart of the province or trend and application of the geologic and engineeringcharacteristics that have been established in the fields discovered todate. Finally, speculative supply is any additional supply that is anticipatedmight be discovered and developed in formations and geologic provincesthat are not presently productive; this estimate is based on the knowngeologic characteristics of the speculative province and analogy withknown productive areas. The estimates of speculative potential resourcesare subject to much greater uncertainty than the estimates of eitherpossible or probable potential.</TEXT></DOC>
