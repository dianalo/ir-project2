The budget, signed Thursday, amounts to $52.8 billion, withfarm-spending set at $31.5 billion, or 56 percent of the total.   It was the first time agriculture payments were kept to under 60percent of the budget since the EEC, or Common Market, was founded31 years ago. The lower agriculture figure was the result of a dealhammered out by the 12 EEC leaders in Brussels in February tostrictly control farm payments.   The cut was made possible by higher-than-forecast world cerealprices and a cheaper U.S. dollar.</TEXT></DOC>
