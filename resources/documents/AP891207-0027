WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A nervous Hans Jurich gestured toward therain-soaked grounds of the secret police institute he directs, aplace where workers crack codes and build eavesdropping devices.   ``As you can see there are no helicopters or tanks here now,''he offered.   In an odd switch that only could have come during these headydays of the East German uprising, it was the secret police who weregetting the third degree.   Jurich's interrogators were reform activists from a new citizenscommittee that has taken it upon itself to probe officialcorruption.   Three activists from the organization, which is quartered abovea religious bookstore on Sophienstrasse, jumped into amud-encrusted Volkswagen Golf on Wednesday after getting a callfrom colleagues with a hot tip.   ``All we know is that witnesses in the area have reported thathelicopters and tanks were moving around yesterday and trucks wereseen hauling away material,'' Gabriela Kleiner of the New Forumpro-democracy group explained as the car careened through EastBerlin's muddy central streets.   ``This could be dangerous. That's why we are taking along thepress, as protection.''   A carload of journalists from the Communist-run Berliner Zeitungfollowed behind the speeding graftbusters.   The ``Independent Investigative Committee'' was formed by reformmovement activists on Sunday after word spread that oustedCommunist leaders accused of corruption were having incriminatingevidence removed from their offices.   Angry citizens began standing watch around official buildings onMonday and Tuesday until police could set up a security cordon toprevent losses.   Communist Premier Hans Modrow has ordered police units tocooperate with the citizens' committee, but officials are stillconsidering whether it should have access to information collectedby a government panel probing corruption.   East German television on Tuesday disclosed the group'sexistence and gave out its address and telephone number for thosewith information to relay.   At least 200 calls were fielded overnight and early Wednesday atthe committee office.   ``This is our second special action,'' explained MatthiasEtzold, driver of the Golf. ``But last time, on Monday, we arrivedtoo late and everything was gone.''   Asked what they planned to do should they encounter the reportedtanks or helicopters, Ms. Kleiner said they would call the police.   After 30 minutes of negotiating rutted roads, the car screechedto a halt in front of a gated and guarded compound onKopenickstrasse.   ``We're from the Independent Investigative Committee and we wantto talk to responsible officials,'' Etzold shouted through thenarrow opening of a clouded plexiglass window at an entrancesecurity booth.   The whole entourage was invited in to meet with federal ministerfor science and research, Peter-Klaus Budig, who hadn't noticedtanks or air actions in recent days.   ``But this is all necessary. I'm all for it,'' the smilingofficial offered eagerly, commenting on the ambush visit. ``It'snecessary to clear the air and have a fresh start.''   Maybe it was the compound next door, where the federal Ministryfor State Security operates a research institute, he offered.   ``Yes, we were told you were coming,'' confessed the gate guardat the secret police's Institute for Technical Research. ``Ourdirector will be here to talk with you in a moment.''   Jurich, a portly, crew-cut bureaucrat sweating profusely despitethe damp December cold, had likely already been having a bad day,since the entire leadership of the secret police resigned Tuesdaynight under pressure.   Reform groups had assailed the ministry's leadership forallowing agents to do what they had done with impunity for years _harass and beat protesters.   Told of reports alleging removal of evidence from the premises,Jurich laughed nervously and pointed out that there was no militaryhardware in evidence.   ``Mind if we have a look around?'' Etzold queried.   First the answer was no, as the compound was a sensitive ``pointof manufacture of electronic warfare materials, which you can useyour imagination to calculate the use of,'' Jurich said.   Then he offered a short tour of the metal-littered grounds inconsolation.   ``We have nothing to hide,'' the director contended.   The group was able to see nothing more complicated than rustingpipes and palettes of what looked like mailboxes piled outsidefactory doors.   No, the investigators could not talk to workers. This was, afterall, a matter of state security.   ``We've wasted our time,'' bemoaned Ms. Kleiner. ``The problemis that we are so naive. This is a Mafia we are dealing with.''</TEXT></DOC>
