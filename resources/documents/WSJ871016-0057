Mathematicians, musicians-turned-stock analysts, and newly minted M.B.A.s reaping vast riches. Thirty-year-olds with condos, BMWs and more money than they knew what to do with -- a product of their own hard work and a raging bull market that meant they could do no wrong.    Suddenly, reality is setting in. Wall Street has laid off nearly 1,100 people in the past month, many of them with six-figure salaries. More layoffs are expected, and those who remain are likely to find their wallets considerably lighter this year. Says a 25-year-old bond trader at Salomon Brothers Inc., which is dismissing 800: &quot;I can't face being poor again.&quot;    So much for the good life. For the first time in more than five years, many securities-industry professionals see a significant reversal in the stock market's direction. Already, the plunging bond market and some enormous trading losses over the past few months have exposed dirty linen some firms didn't know they had: unprofitable business lines, monstrous overhead and skimpy management controls.    Now, large-scale financial soul-searching is under way that could lead to Wall Street's first major restructuring since commission rates were deregulated in 1975. First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Kidder Peabody Group Inc. and E.F. Hutton Group Inc. are among those conducting strategic studies to decide where the future of their business lies.    Competitive pressures are squeezing the profit margins of once-successful businesses. Several firms are studying their municipal, corporate and government bond businesses; money-market and commodities operations; and mortgage- and real-estate-brokerage units to see whether they can afford to remain in there -- at least at present staffing levels.    &quot;We're going to have to run our firms like regular businesses, instead of with the bull market at our backs,&quot; says Max C. Chapman Jr., the president of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., which said this week that it is going to pare 100 people from its 280-person municipal-bond operation.    But while retrenching now in some areas, the big Wall Street firm of the future is likely to be a venture fraught with even more risk and competition. In search of bigger and quicker profits, many Wall Street firms have targeted the merchant-banking business, which will require them to invest their own money in takeovers and leveraged buyouts.    Wall Street is also gambling on the creation of highly specialized securities, which, while well-suited to the needs of corporate issuers, can be hazardous to own or trade in volatile markets. And some firms plan to increase the amount of their own bets in so-called arbitrage trading in the stock and bond markets.    By moving in this manner, Wall Street is distancing itself from its heritage as agent for clients' transactions. It is risking its future -- and the stakes of its public stockholders -- on its ability to successfully execute its own transactions.    Of course, Wall Street isn't on the brink of oblivion. Says Lewis Glucksman, a former head of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. who operates his own investmentbanking firm: &quot;The reassessment of costs is healthy. It is overdue, but not so overdue that it comes when the patient is too sick to recover.&quot;    There are several reasons for such optimism. Firms that draw much of their earnings from investment banking, like Morgan Stanley Group Inc., are doing well. The equity trading and commission business -- always cyclical -- has been strong, as the stock market's boom far outpaced the bond market's. Many Street executives say that even if such business falls off, as it is threatening to do, it will come back eventually.    Even a sagging business like government bond trading can be profitable for a firm like Salomon Brothers that knows how to trade under adverse conditions. And despite the recent market jitters, big retail houses like Shearson Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. are still drawing enormous fees from the billions of dollars they manage for wealthy individuals, pension funds and other institutions.    But falling profits at several firms have accelerated the Street's me-first credo. Because compensation at many houses comes from bonuses tied to earnings, traders and investment bankers have been squabbling. At First Boston, where bond traders lost $100 million last spring, investment bankers are concerned that the losses may come out of their bonuses.    The Wall Street of the future could spell doom for many participants in one of the biggest cultural phenomena of the 1980s: the overpaid yuppie. Says Joseph R. Hardiman, the president of the National Association of Securities Dealers: &quot;There's going to be a culture shock for many of these young people who have come to expect these high salaries to finance their high life styles. There are going to be fewer Hermes ties on the Street.&quot; Adds John Keefe, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst: &quot;What is this going to do to {New York} real-estate prices? What about Rolex prices?&quot;    The concern on the Street has already made its way to the campuses. Samuel Hayes, who teaches investment banking at Harvard Business School, says that students seeking his advice now worry about whether there will be a job for them on the Street and for how long.    Wall Street has gone through tough times before when costs exploded during periods of expansion -- in the early 1970s, for example. Yet some people feel that the industry hasn't benefited from experience. &quot;I'm surprised, frankly, that Wall Street hasn't learned from past bear markets,&quot; says Prof. Hayes.    Wall Streeters insist that things will be different this time. For one thing, most firms have shareholders now, and some have impatient corporate parents. &quot;We've got these big shareholders like GE saying, 'Hey, don't we deserve a decent return?'&quot; says Mr. Chapman of Kidder, which is 80% owned by General Electric Co.    Wall Street executives say they are committed to bringing in new talent, but at a generally lower price. &quot;You can't pay every 26-year-old in Mandamp;A $650,000 just because you can charge $15 million for a merger, because there comes a time when you can't charge that much,&quot; says Felix Rohatyn, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Lazard Freres andamp; Co. &quot;The banks will do it for less.&quot;    Nonetheless, Wall Street executives contend you still have to spend a buck to make a couple more. &quot;This industry is always going to carry a high level of compensation&quot; because of the stresses placed on many employees, says Peter A. Cohen, Shearson Lehman's chairman. &quot;We just don't hesitate to tell a guy to get on a plane, go to Hong Kong, and you may not be back for a month or two or three.&quot;    Thus, cost cutting alone won't bring firms the 20% to 30% profit margins they have become accustomed to. After slashing 800 staffers this week, Salomon said it was pinning much of its hopes on the high-risk, high-reward world of merchant banking.    For firms already there, the business of investing their own money in mergers and other deals has been a bonanza; Merrill Lynch earned more than $70 million in fees when an investment group it led acquired Borg-Warner Corp. earlier this year.    But there are risks. Firms like Merrill, Shearson and First Boston regularly bet nearly $1 billion of their own money by making bridge loans to get such deals moving.    Wall Streeters predict that as more firms join the merchant-banking line, firms will tend to bid up the amounts they will invest, increasing the risk if a target company fails. Some firms that are already succeeding at merchant banking say they have some even bigger and riskier projects in store. &quot;The risks are going to be enormous,&quot; says Joseph R. Perella, co-head of investment banking at First Boston. &quot;We're going to be getting into things no one ever fathomed.&quot;    Competition is also expected to heighten. Drexel Burnham's chief executive, Frederick H. Joseph, cautions newcomers: &quot;Not so fast. Merchant banking will become very competitive very quickly.&quot;    At First Boston, the scope of merchant banking was the subject of a squabble last July between Chief Executive Peter T. Buchanan and Mr. Perella's colleague, Bruce Wasserstein. Mr. Wasserstein, a leading example of the innovators pushing Wall Street into riskier ventures, doesn't like the committee meetings he has to go through before the firm will let him commit a large portion of its cash to a deal, senior officials at First Boston say. They add that Mr. Buchanan is still hesitant to take some of the risks championed by his banking stars -- a stand that could lead to future tension. Mr. Wasserstein has already considered leaving the firm on a few occasions.    While the risks of merchant banking have yet to manifest themselves in a major loss, the risks of some new, highly complex securities have already been revealed. Merrill Lynch lost an astounding $377 million earlier this year by trading just one complex mortgage vehicle.    The risks are great in such securities because they have no track record. When interest rates become volatile, it is hard to predict how -- or whether -- the products will sell. &quot;The firms are creating a multiheaded monster,&quot; says securities lawyer Ira Lee Sorkin, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's New York office. &quot;No one truly understands what they are selling and how these complex programs are really supposed to function in the marketplace.&quot;    Still, it is by creating such securities that Wall Street hopes to fuel much of its future earnings. Profit margins on typical mortgage products, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds, have narrowed sharply as many competitors have entered the market. The same goes for government and high-grade corporate bonds.    The answer? New-fangled products, such as commodity warrants and a collection of mortgage-related products. Harvard's Mr. Hayes says it is a reputation for innovation that has given Wall Street an edge over foreign competitors in London and Tokyo. Japanese firms, for example, have been far more interested in gaining market share in established markets by undercutting prices of Wall Street competitors.    The same computer wizards who are creating these new products also offer the Street new trading opportunities. By using computer-aided analysis, Wall Street can identify and exploit price differences between related products such as bonds and bond futures. The head of one Wall Street firm argues that betting the firm's capital in this manner makes more sense than risking billions every day in the volatile corporate- and government-bond markets, largely to serve clients. &quot;It's a much more intellectual approach to risk than having some bond trader guessing about where he thinks the market will go,&quot; he says.    Such risk-taking may not sit well with shareholders, who look for consistent earnings. Some Wall Street professionals say that this could result in a desire by some firms to become private again. Salomon may have opened the door when it announced this week that it intends to buy back some of its stock in the open market. Rumors that Salomon is considering a buyout have swirled through the firm for months, although Chairman John H. Gutfreund has denied that such a move is contemplated.    While many Wall Street executives chart a flashier and riskier future, some contrarians are praising an old and distinctly unglamorous business: retail brokerage. When Merrill Lynch reported increased third-quarter earnings despite the slumping markets, analysts were quick to point to the firm's booming interest profit, derived in part from lending money to customers to buy securities.    Says Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.: &quot;Retail brokerage doesn't have the limousines and the $400-a-night hotel rooms&quot; of investment banking, &quot;but it's a good, steady business.&quot;    ---   Craig Forman contributed to this article.    ---            Wall Street's Higher Salaries                            1987           1982 Job                        Salary/        Salary/ Classification             Bonus          Bonus Senior investment          $150,000/      $100,000/ banker                      750,000        350,000 Senior municipal             67,459/        55,528/ bond trader                  59,263         64,016 Chief technical              80,381/        76,203/ anaylst                      79,872         51,860 Retail registered rep.       97,100         62,788 Margin clerk                 25,012         20,644 Source: Securities Industry Association; Wall Streetofficials.
