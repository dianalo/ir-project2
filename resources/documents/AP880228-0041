Col. William R.Higgins, a U.S. official said Sunday.   The official, who spoke in Jerusalem on condition of anonymity,said Assad told Secretary of State George P. Shultz during hisvisit to Damascus on Saturday that he had ``some ideas'' aboutHiggins' case.   The official said Shultz and Assad talked about the situation inLebanon but declined to elaborate. ``We can't get into it,'' hesaid when pressed for details.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., headed a U.N. observer teamattached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon. He waskidnapped Feb. 17 while returning to U.N. headquarters in Naqourafrom the port city of Tyre.   The kidnapping brought to 25 the number of foreign hostages heldin Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself the``Oppressed on Earth'' claimed responsibility for Higgins'abduction and said he was a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N. officials deniedthe accusation.   In Beirut, a senior militia official said Sunday that Higgins'kidnapping has imperiled Lebanon's Shiite Moslem sect.   ``This is the first abduction that has brought the sect's twogiants close to a head-on collision,'' said Abdul-Majid Saleh,chief political officer of Justice Minister Nabih Berri'smainstream Shiite Amal militia in south Lebanon.   The Syrian-allied Amal has been at loggerheads with theIranian-backed extremist Hezbollah, or Party of God, for severalyears, but the kidnapping has increased tensions.   Amal has viewed the abduction as a challenge to its dominance inthe Tyre region and has vowed to leave no stone unturned in southLebanon to rescue the combat-decorated Vietnam veteran. Hezbollahpraised the abduction and called Higgins a ``filthy American.''   Saleh told reporters in Tyre that the abduction was ``more of aperil to the Shiite community than to the United States. It hasbeen threatening to kindle an intercommunal strife.''   Saleh said an unidentified third party was currently engaged ina mediation effort to ensure Higgins' release and head off anAmal-Hezbollah clash.   In Damascus, Information Minister Mohammed Salman said Sundaythat Syria had assured Shultz of its continued efforts to gainHiggins' release.   In an interview with The Associated Press, Salman said Syria'spolicy is to work with friendly organizations in Lebanon, inparticular the Amal militia, to obtain the release of the one-timeaide to former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.   Salman said President Reagan had asked Assad for help insecuring Higgins' release.   Syrian officials noted with irony Reagan's request and therecent parade of U.S. officials to Damascus. Just two years ago theUnited States accused Syria of terrorism, brought its ambassadorhome and slapped sanctions against it.   Salman said he believed the turnabout came when Washingtonrealized that no Middle East settlement was possible without Syriaand the Palestine Liberation Organization.   Last October, U.S. Ambassador William Eagleton returned to hispost in Damacus.   Salman said Eagleton informed him 10 days ago that anothersanction, restrictions on visas for Syrians tarveling to the UnitedStates, had been lifted.   Shultz, explaining the U.S. shift, has said Syria had distanceditself from terrorism.   Last year Syria closed the Damascus office of Palestinianterrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Al-Banna, split from the PLOin the early 1970s. He was convicted in absentia in Italy earlierthis month of masterminding a 1985 terrorist attack on a Romeairport in which 16 people were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
