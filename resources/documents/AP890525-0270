Union and company officials who commented Thursday on thepotential impact of a strike expressed hope a contract agreementwould be reached by Saturday night's deadline.   But the unions _ the Communications Workers of America and theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers _ also attackedanew American Telephone andamp; Telegraph's proposal to shift more healthcare costs to workers. And it appeared increasingly unlikely anagreement would be reached by the deadline.   The unions have hinted they would not immediately call a strikeand would rely instead on other tactics designed to pressure ATandamp;Tinto a settlement, primarily a nationwide labor boycott that unionofficials contend could cut ATandamp;T's daily long-distance volume by 8percent.   Still, a strike is expected if no agreement is reached withinseveral days after the deadline.   If there is a strike, both sides are in virtual agreement overthe likely impact on ATandamp;T long-distance services, which includeabout 80 million calls on an average business day and whichgenerated $35.2 billion in 1988 revenues for the company.   Technological advances should allow ATandamp;T to provide direct-diallong-distance services without significant interruptions.   However, customers needing operator assistance for long distancewould have to rely on management personnel filling in for operatorswho struck; there are an estimated 21,500 union workers in thosejobs.   In addition, 35,500 technicians are represented by the unions,and management would be called on to perform their jobs as well.Those tasks include installing and maintaining telecommunicationsequipment both within ATandamp;T offices and in businesses nationwide. Acompany spokesman said ATandamp;T has management teams prepared tocomplete all major installations scheduled for the next five weeks.   Also, the nearly 37,000 CWA and IBEW factory workers in theUnited States would be expected to strike. ATandamp;T plans to keep itsU.S. factories open but concedes that a widespread strike wouldessentially halt production of switching and transmission equipment.   ``It's pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picketlines are being honored on a high percentage basis,'' ATandamp;Tspokesman Herb Linnen said.   ATandamp;T is the leader in developing sensitive long-distanceequipment and of late has been aggressively seeking to expand itsglobal sales.   Also, 54,000 union workers perform clerical, sales,administrative and other tasks, including staffing ATandamp;T retailsales outlets. In these areas a strike could have substantialimpact on operations, union officials said.   Linnen refused to disclose how many management personnel werepart of the ``emergency teams'' he said were being readied for apossible strike. That planning is under way at ATandamp;T's operationscenter in New Jersey.   ``Our objective is to provide the kind of high-quality servicethat customers expect from ATandamp;T and we will press into service ourexperienced supervisory people to fill in if there is a workstoppage,'' Linnen said.   Union officials essentially agreed with Linnen's account.   ``Anytime you take 175,000 people off the job it has an impacton that business,'' said Francine Zucker, spokeswoman for theCommunications Workers of America. ``But the unions don't have anyillusions that we can shut ATandamp;T totally down.''   Ms. Zucker said during a 26-day CWA strike in 1986 ``some of themanagers who replaced operators proved they could do the job,others did not. They are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliarjobs and the added stress would have an impact on the quality ofservice.''   ATandamp;T workers represented by the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers did not honor the CWA strike three years ago butare negotiating jointly with CWA for the first time this year.Three years ago ATandamp;T was able to keep its IBEW-represententedmanufacturing plants open.   The negotiations, which began in late March, are hung up overATandamp;T's proposal to shift health care costs to workers. The companysays it spent $1 billion on health care last year and forecasts a10 percent annual increase for the next several years unless itredesigns its program.   The unions have attacked that proposal and also have termedinadequate ATandamp;T's pay offer, which included varying base wageincreases for employees, lump sum payments and the company'sfirst-ever profit-sharing plan for the unionized workers.   The unions are expected to make a formal counter-offer on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
