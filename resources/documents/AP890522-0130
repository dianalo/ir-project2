Bob Miller said his state wonfederal assurance Monday that it will be allowed to independentlyassess the suitability of Yucca Mountain as the nation's firstpermanent dump for high-level nuclear waste.   Miller and all four members of the Nevada congressionaldelegation met with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins atdepartmental headquarters to reiterate their opposition to havingthe dump in their state.   ``We went into the meeting as opponents of the repository beingin Nevada, and we left the meeting with the same opposition,''Miller said in an interview.   The department is scheduled to begin its own on-site feasibilitystudies later this year. The dump, if Yucca Mountain is deemed asuitable site, would open in 2003.   Miller said Watkins pledged that Nevada would be given a fullopportunity to do its own studies of the site, about 100 milesnorthwest of Las Vegas. Watkins also promised ``some additionalfunding'' for the state studies, although exact amounts were notdiscussed, Miller said.   Christina Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said Watkins' officehad no comment on the meeting.   Miller said Watkins had given his ``personal assurance thatYucca Mountain was not a done deal,'' and that the department wouldmake a full and objective study of the site before deciding whetherit would be suitable for holding the waste.   The dump is intended to entomb 70,000 tons of highly radioactivewaste from commercial reactors and from the Energy Department'snuclear weapons plants. Numerous sites had been under considerationearly in the decade, but in 1987 Congress decreed that the searchwould be limited to Yucca Mountain.   Watkins earlier this month said that while he was legallyobligated to pursuing the Yucca Mountain program, he sympathizedwith the Nevada government's misgivings.   Miller said he and the Nevada congressonal delegation weresending a letter to the state Senate expressing support for a billthat would make it illegal to build a permanent nuclear waste dumpin Nevada. The bill passed the state Assembly earlier this year andhas not yet been acted on by the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
