Throughouttheir dual existence, American railroads and the coal industry enjoyeda mutually beneficial association. On the Northern Plains, however, thispartnership assumed new dimensions. There, the coal and rails exertedunique influences upon one another. The location of deposits determinedmany of the transcontinentals' early decisions, especially route selection.The native fuel also was used to promote settlement on railroad lands.Two of the roads, the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, held land grantscontaining valuable deposits. The Great Northern, having no such subsidy,acquired coal lands in northern Montana. On these properties, the threerailroads pioneered the region's commercial coal mining industry. Eventually,each formed subsidiaries to direct their coal operations. While muchof their production supplied steam locomotives, some was sold to thepublic. Furthermore, the policies of the Northern Pacific and Great Northernespecially enabled their coal to stimulate non-railroad enterprises.In addition, all three provided the transportation which made exploitationby others economically feasible.</TEXT></DOC>
