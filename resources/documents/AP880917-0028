The FCC said in a written order Friday that ATandamp;T will be able tooffer special pricing plans for telecommunications services torespond to individual customers who have been offered lower pricesby competing long-distance companies.   ``The commission action recognizes the intense level ofcompetition in the business long-distance market and it allows ATandamp;Tto respond competitively as conditions warrant,'' ATandamp;T said.   ATandamp;T said the decision was ``good news for alltelecommunications customers'' because it would enable the companyto attract more large-business customers to its networks, ``withcost savings flowing to all.''   But ATandamp;T's competitors, including MCI Communications Corp., hadobjected to ATandamp;T's pricing plan, saying that if discount pricingwere allowed, ATandamp;T would be able to undercut the competition withpredatory pricing.   ATandamp;T had proposed the discount pricing plan after Holiday Corp.told the company it planned to switch its chain of Holiday Innhotels to MCI long-distance services unless ATandamp;T could offer a planthat was priced competitively.   ATandamp;T, which serves about 70 percent of the long-distance market,is the only long-distance carrier whose rates are subject tofederal regulation and which must file with the FCC the prices itcharges for its services. Other carriers can set their prices belowATandamp;T's and offer customers special discounted packages of servicesto individual customers.   The agency's action allows ATandamp;T to offer a pricing plan forHoliday Corp. that will provide long-distance services to HolidayInns at rates 5 percent to 10 percent below ATandamp;T's PRO America IIservice, which is offered to other business cutomers.   The Holiday plan will be allowed to go into effect today, butthe FCC will conduct an investigation and is requiring the companyto keep separate accounts of the costs and revenues generated bythe account to assure that other ATandamp;T ratepayers will not besubsidizing the discounts for Holiday, the FCC said.   As part of the investigation, the FCC said it would considerwhether the pricing plan can be justified under the 1934Communications Act, which prohibits telephone companies fromoffering rates that are unreasonably or unduly discriminatory amongits customers.   The commission said it would conclude the investigation promptlybut set no deadline.   Commissioner Patricia Dennis, one of the three sitting FCCcommissioners, dissented from the decision, saying she objected toallowing ATandamp;T to put its Holiday pricing plan into effect until theinvestigation was completed.   She said she questioned whether the Holiday pricing plan waslegal. ``There is a strong likelihood that the commission isallowing an unreasonably discriminatory and unlawful tariff to takeeffect,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
