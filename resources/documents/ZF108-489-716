(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Why You Should Be Making IS AlliesandM;A few years ago, the idea would have bordered on heresy: information systemsaren't the source of competitive advantage for an organization, just simplyone of several forces that savvy leaders can bring to bear in transformingtheir enterprises.andM;That message, however, is quickly becoming religion among IS executives.andO;Shut out of the boardroom and wisened by less than perfect experiences withso-called strategic systems, they are now focusing on building alliances withbusiness unit and line managers and on building systems that help refineinternal business processes.andP;  In doing so, they are hoping to build a broadconstituency of support and a recognition throughout their companies that ISshould be a business partner, not just a technology provider.andM;&quot;IS is coming out of a period of time when people got confused,&quot; says DonShump, the recently appointed IS vice president of Scott Paper Co. inPhiladelphia.andP;  &quot;My feeling is IS is a strategic factor.andP;  It is not thestrategic factor....andP;  What we need to think about is how to leverageinformation technology and understand its impact on the other strategicfactors that may be more important in the total scheme of things.&quot;andM;As obvious as the benefits of forming alliances with business-unit peers maybe, it was hardly the approach or the role for IS seen by gurus and othersjust a few years ago.andP;  Business-school professors and management consultantspredicted that by now IS executives would be seated at the right hand of thechief executive officer and a peer to all top staff and line managers in thecompany.andP;  Having used information technology to deliver significantcompetitive advantage, the vice president of MIS was supposed to have beentransformed into the chief information officer, a member of the executiveelite.andM;Yet, rather than taking a part in planning the futures of their companies,most IS executives continue to be viewed by their CEOs strictly as supportspecialists, more concerned with how IT works than with how it could be usedto support the business.andP;  Rather than reporting to the CEO or president, mostcontinue to report to the CFO or some other staff executive.andP;  Rather thansporting the flashy CIO title, most continue to carry the more mundane vicepresident or director of MIS label.andP;  Rather than participate actively in keystrategic planning sessions, most are still either left out or expected onlyto answer technology-related questions.andM;&quot;Most IS executives at even the largest companies are surprisingly stilllargely excluded from the inner circle and from having an influence on thestrategic directions of their companies,&quot; says Gerald L. Hershey, a businessprofessor at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, who recentlysurveyed the heads of the 150 largest IS shops in the country.andP;  Only 27% ofthe respondents said they are involved in some level of corporate planning.andM;The disparity between where IS leaders thought they'd be and where theyactually are now in the corporate hierarchy has caused many top IS executivesto regroup and reevaluate their roles in the corporation.andP;  Besides formingalliances with the business units their systems support, they are looking atpromises they've made in the past and reexamining their methods of movingahead in today's corporations.andP;  Many are deemphasizing the promise that wassupposed to have gained them entry to that inner circle: the idea that ITcould create quick and overwhelming competitive advantage for every company.andM;&quot;We have been led to believe.andP;  .  .that information services is the key tocompetitive advantage,&quot; says Ray Perry, vice president of Avon ProductsInc.'s Information Systems Division In Rye, N.Y.andP;  &quot;We've set up a lot ofexpectations that, if you want to become the next chairman of your company,what you had to do was find a use for technology similar to AmericanAirlines' SABRE system.andP;  .  .  .  I'm not sure that that's in any wayrealistic.andP;  In fact, the examples where technology's really given acompetitive edge are not very many.andP;  .  .  .  What it really amounts to is ateam of people--each one contributing something to the end result, and all ofthem working very hard.andP;  There just aren't that many sparkling visions thatcome along, and you'd be better off to spend your time making yourcontributions as a member of the team.&quot;andM;Performance, Not PromisesandM;Competitive advantage through IT may still be a reasonable goal, particularlyin industries such as financial services and airline reservations, whereinformation is embedded in the product itself.andP;  And support from seniorexecutives is more important now than ever.andP;  But IS executives are seriouslyexamining their methods for reaching that goal.andP;  Rather than swinging wildlyfor the big competitive advantage home run application that is supposed towin them recognition and respect from CEOs, many IS executives are focusingon building alliances with business unit and line management.andP;  They're doingso by building applications that fundamentally redesign and improve the waybusinesses run internally.andP;  Although such efforts ultimately produceoperations efficiencies that mean increased competitiveness, they, unlikeclassical competitive advantage systems such as American Airlines' SABREsystem, aren't designed to create new products and reshuffle the competitivebalance of power in an industry overnight.andM;At Nissan Motor Corp., headquartered in Gardena, Calif., for example,Information Services director Evan Wride has been working hard to improve theways the company's U.S.andP;  operation gets cars from the factory to its dealers.andO;Like many car companies, the U.S.andP;  subsidiary of Tokyo-based Nissan Motor Co.andO;Ltd. is not currently set up to allow its dealers to order cars directly fromthe factory.andP;  Instead, Nissan's U.S.andP;  headquarters orders the cars andattempts to predict which models and which colors will be in heavy demandfour months later when the vehicles arrive at the dealers' showrooms.andO;Nissan's IS group is working with the company's dealers, headquarters andfactories to develop a network that will allow dealers to order vehiclesthemselves and cut delivery lead times in half.andM;Putting together such a project isn't easy.andP;  The key, says Wride, isunderstanding the business needs of the various constituencies.andP;  That meansspending time with dealers and business unit managers.andP;  &quot;The real trick isthe relationships that the people in my department build with the people inthe operating divisions over time--moment by moment, week by week, month bymonth.andP;  That's where it really comes to life.andP;  The only way to do that is todevelop a good business relationship with the key guys out there so that theytrust you.&quot;andM;For Nissan, trust has translated into active IS participation in thecompany's three-year-old strategic-planning process, which is led by the CEO.andO;&quot;My job in those sessions is now to take a more proactive stance and initiateideas for systems, whether it be new systems or enhancements to old systems,and not wait for someone [else] to think of it or ask about it,&quot; says Wride.andM;Building a relationship with line executives and aligning IS goals withcorporate goals will eventually win IS a place in management's inner circle,Wride believes.andP;  &quot;Sometimes when these [senior] executives get together at atable, they don't even have to talk that much.andP;  They use fewer words, becauseso much is already understood.andP;  I'm still in the process of building thoserelationships,&quot; says Wride, who reports to Nissan's CFO.andM;Where's the Business Savvy?andM;A real or perceived inability on the part of IS executives to understand thecompany's business and place it above technology continues to be the majorroadblock preventing both line and upper management from accepting IS as apartner, observers say.andP;  Barry Sullivan, director of marketing for ElectronicData Systems Corp. of Dallas says he has talked to more than 100 CEOs overthe last year, and he has heard three main reasons for not accepting IS as apartner.andP;  &quot;They don't believe they have quality business people running IS.andO;They don't understand IS costs.andP;  And they feel IS has its own agenda that isnot necessarily the business' agenda,&quot; says Sullivan.andM;Charles Darnell, senior vice president for IS at Lithonia Lighting inConyers, Ga., puts it another way.andP;  &quot;They're all nerds,&quot; he says of top ISexecutives.andP;  &quot;Most of them are still concerned about IS or technology stuff.andO;They want to talk about whether to outsource or whether to insource.andP;  Butthat's just an internal IS issue,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;They should be looking at theway people in the company want to do business.andP;  And they should not let ISprocedures or cost justifications stand in their way.&quot;andM;The 25-year Lithonia veteran was able to see problems with IS strategy earlyin his career and has worked successfully to build alliances with linemanagement and use IS so streamline the business.andP;  From the beginning,Darnell has met regularly with Lithonia's marketing representatives anddistributors in order to learn the company's business.andP;  That led toLightLink, a communication network between Lithonia and its external businesspartners and customers.andP;  It also brought Darnell's business knowledge to theattention of CEO Jim McClung who, in the early 1980s, appointed Darnell tohead a new, companywide strategic planning effort.andP;  Later, McClung namedDarnell a senior vice president and gave him line responsibility for a thirdof the $1 billion company's products.andP;  Darnell retains responsibility for IS.andM;Darnell's ability to sell himself to upper management as a business partnerhas meant an expanded role for IS at Lithonia.andP;  According to McClung,&quot;Although we're not that large, we do a lot of things that utilizeinformation services .andP;  .  .  throughout our organization and reaching intothe marketplace.&quot;andM;Learning to walk and talk like a businessperson, rather than a technologyexpert, however, is a lot harder said than done for a lot of top ISexecutives.andP;  Most began their careers sheltered in the technologyenvironment, and within its walls they have remained.andP;  Only in the last fewyears has the technology matured to a point where building and maintaining atechnical infrastructure has not been a day-to-day struggle.andM;As the demands on top IS executives shift from an emphasis exclusively ontechnical proficiency to incorporate the ability to communicate about andcontribute to the business, a few companies are making a concerted effort toprovide IS people with broader business knowledge.andP;  Some, like The Procter andamp;Gamble Co., have sent entire IS departments--from secretaries to CIOs--tobusiness-training courses.andP;  Others have begun rotating executives from linejobs into top IS spots and moving IS executives into other line or staffpositions.andP;  Avon's Perry, for example, worked in finance and auditing foreight years before returning to IS.andP;  At Rochester, N.Y.-based Eastman KodakCo., IS director Henry Pfendt was in marketing for five years before joiningIS, and Cathy Hudson managed a major line business before becoming CIO.andM;Half Empty or Half Full?andM;Some view the acceptance of IS professionals in the business circle asimproving.andP;  &quot;Actually, if you say 27% of IS executives are involved instrategic planning, maybe that's not so bad,&quot; says Ed Sherin, CIO for the NewYork City-based financial services company Primerica Corp.andP;  &quot;You've got toremember that that's up from 0% just a few years ago.&quot;andM;Sherin himself would have to be considered one of the fortunate few.andP;  When hecame to the financial services conglomerate two years ago, he already had astrong business relationship with Primerica CEO Sanford Weil, with whom hehad once worked at American Express.andP;  That tie, plus Weil's fundamentalbelief in the competitive value of IT, helped gain Sherin a degree of instantcredibility and a seat on Primerica's 12-person board of corporate officers.andO;&quot;I have a bird's-eye view of the corporation .andP;  .  .  and good access to theCEO.andP;  There's no way you can overstate the importance of that,&quot; says Sherin.andM;But, even for a well-placed CIO like Sherin, a seat at the planning table andaccess to the CEO is not enough.andP;  Sherin says he has tried to build on thatby forming partnerships with line managers in Primerica's decentralizedbusiness units.andP;  And he's started by emphasizing improvements in operationalefficiencies and business processes rather than by promoting major,high-profile competitive advantage applications.andM;&quot;You really have to start there,&quot; Sherin says.andP;  &quot;If you can put dollars onsomebody's bottom line, the discussion becomes much easier.&quot;andP;  Among otherprojects, Sherin has engineering a Tariff 12 bulk telecommunications contractwith ATandamp;T, which he says has saved Primerica's business units many millionsof dollars.andM;Another way IS executives are gaining credibility with line and seniormanagement is by being as responsible as other business units.andP;  This includesthe willingness to cut expenses by as much or more than other units whencompanies decide it's time to pare down.andP;  It's in that context that many ISorganizations are opting to outsource utility, data-center-orientedoperations not considered strategic to the corporation.andP;  &quot;The CIO has toprove he can play ball and cut his costs by 40% just like everyone else orhe'll be fired,&quot; says Paul Dixon, management consultant for Total SystemsInc. of Midvale, Utah.andM;To Larry Bacon, IS vice president of The Travelers Corp. in Hartford, Conn.,andO;avoiding special treatment is part of proving that IS can be business savvy.andO;Most of the strategic-planning at Travelers takes place in the company'sdecentralized business units.andP;  And, says Bacon, when key executives in thoseunits sit down to plan the future, &quot;I want [my people] to be there as equalswith everybody else that's around the table.andP;  So if the business is planning,we're part of the planning.andP;  If that business is cost cutting, we're part ofthe cost cutting.&quot;andM;Making it into strategic planning meetings is not an impossible dream, asAvon's Perry can attest.andP;  Since taking on the company's top IS post 20 monthsago, Perry has been concentrating on applications to make Avon's extensivedoor-to-door product distribution network more efficient.andP;  Avon is planningto augment its existing selling force with telemarketing, toll-free 800 phonelines and other automation efforts.andP;  Perry says he was able to get a jump onupper management's strategic push toward modernizing Avon's sales channelbecause he reports to the company's executive vice president for planning andis involved in key planning and business development meetings with uppermanagement.andM;&quot;When all of those things are in the initial discussion stage, I'm able toplay a role with each of the business people in those areas, telling themways that information systems can do that more effectively, more quickly thanif I got hit blindsided by these things,&quot; says Perry.andM;It's What and Who You KnowandM;In fact, says Perry, working as a partner with line managers and beinginvolved in key planning sessions is far more important than reportingdirectly to the top.andP;  &quot;I'd rather get invited to the right meetings and getcalled upon to support the right kind of strategic activities than report tothe chairman.&quot;andM;That's good, says Perry's boss, because IS at Avon probably isn't going to bea peer of the chairman or CEO anytime soon.andP;  Robert Pratt, vice president forbusiness development and planning, says IS at Avon has become a strongerstrategic partner to the business units as the company has attempted to pushdecision making closer to the business by decentralizing operations.andP;  &quot;In thepast .andP;  .  .  IS tended to fill orders, even if they didn't feel it was whatthey ought to be doing,&quot; says Pratt.andP;  &quot;But when we hired Ray, [Perry] we werelooking for someone who could change that.andP;  They're now expected to takeideas to their customers and to be proactive and to stand up, if necessary,and say, 'That is not a very good idea.'&quot;andM;But just because IS is involved in strategic planning at Avon doesn't mean ISis going to be driving the strategy at the company.andP;  Pratt says IS people whothink they should be the source of competitive advantage and strategicdirection are getting way ahead of themselves.andP;  &quot;In most areas that growquickly or where there's room for imaginative thinking .andP;  .  .  that tends tohappen a bit,&quot; says Pratt.andP;  &quot;Some disciplines like planning have gone througha settling back of expectations.andP;  Some of that is happening in theinformation area.&quot;andM;IS has good reason to lower its expectations.andP;  For many IS executives, astraight-ahead policy of promising competitive advantage and pushing forinclusion in management's inner circle has meant at least a temporary ticketto the unemployment line.andP;  Some IS executives have been forced out preciselybecause senior management accepted IS as a strategic factor.andP;  &quot;Finallysomeone says, 'Yes, I really believe technology is strategic, and you're notthe one to execute that because you're obviously a support-type person,'&quot;says Charles McCaig, senior IS vice president at Mutual Benefit LifeInsurance Co. of Newark, N.J.andP;  Other IS executives have fought a losingbattle against rising upper management expectations.andM;Increased upper management cost consciousness in an era of buy-outs andtakeovers also has a lot to do with what Chuck Callan, a vice president atthe Index Group, calls &quot;a clear shift from an external look to an internalfocus&quot; for many IS executives.andP;  The Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm'srecently released annual survey of 335 top IS executives showed &quot;reshapingbusiness process through IT&quot; heading the list of IS issues for 1990.andP;  At thesame time, &quot;using IS for competitive breakthroughs&quot; dropped from first in1989 all the way down to eighth in 1990.andM;&quot;Some companies went too far with competitive advantage, and they became alittle disillusioned,&quot; Callan says.andP;  &quot;The idea was oversold in some cases.andO;The expectations weren't met.andP;  And there was some overspending going on.&quot;andM;But Callan warns that just because IS is looking more at internal businessprocesses and partnering with line managers, gaining acceptance and supportat the top of the corporation shouldn't be deemphasized.andP;  &quot;Many times theseprojects become very complex and cut across functional lines,&quot; says Callan.andO;&quot;And that's where it gets thorny.andP;  You've got to have strong, high-levelsponsorship to pull it off.&quot;andM;Changing LanesandM;Even where IS clearly has the full support of the chairman and CEO, buildingcredibility and partnerships with line management can be a constantchallenge.andP;  That's what Don Lasher found out after taking over the IS reignsat San Antonio-based United Services Automobile Association (USAA) two yearsago.andP;  Originally brought into the company as a special IT assistant tochairman and CEO Robert F. McDermott, Lasher was made a full divisionpresident last year.andP;  Now IS at USAA is on a par with the company's fourfinancial service lines of business, reporting directly to McDermott.andP;  Theboost gave Lasher the high-level sponsorship he needed to be taken seriouslyby the other business units.andP;  It also made him a target at first.andM;&quot;We've been attacked many times,&quot; says Lasher.andP;  &quot;People in the divisionssaid, 'IS is not a division.andP;  It's a support function.andP;  It doesn't belong.'&quot;andM;But Lasher says he's gradually managed to turn things around.andP;  &quot;Most of thebusiness people now see us as business partners.andP;  They see that IS is endemicto everything we do around here, and they realize that they need more of it.&quot;andM;Lasher says he won over most line managers by delivering applications thatworked and by setting up an elaborate system of management councils thatbring together senior management, IS management and line management.andP;  Theyinclude at least one regularly scheduled executive council, chaired by theCEO, which focuses only on corporate IS issues.andP;  Other councils bring in linemanagers and IS to discuss IS strategic and tactical issues related tospecific business units.andP;  Lasher has also put his IS people throughIBM-sponsored business training.andM;The result, says Lasher, is that the attacks from line management havestopped and partnerships have been formed at the business unit level.andP;  Andsupport from upper management has been strengthened.andP;  &quot;Our success and evensurvival will be closely tied to how well we will be able to compete in themarketplace on technological grounds,&quot; says McDermott.andM;Although McDermott's actions have matched his words, many IS executivesreceive lip service from CEOs, who shut them out of the inner circle ofstrategic planning.andP;  &quot;It's trendy for senior executives to say they believein IT, but what it really comes down to for many of them is, Give me a poundof SABRE organization,&quot; says Sarah Caull, a principal of Index Group andassociate director of Prism, a research service provided by Index and Hammerand Co. of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;They [senior executives] don't understand thatthey have a role to play in that process, too.andP;  They have to meet IS halfway,&quot; says Caull.andM;While many IS executives are still struggling to think like businesspeople,senior management in the United States has done a poor job at strategicplanning overall, observers say.andP;  &quot;Quite frankly, to the extent that there isno long-term strategic planning in information technology, that is only asymptom of the absence of it at the corporate level,&quot; says Total's Dixon.andO;&quot;For that you have to look 70 to 80% to general management and the boards [ofdirectors] and only 30 to 20% to technology management.&quot;andM;In a few cases, says Dixon, strategic planning at the corporate level waspractically nonexistent until IS put its own planning process together,stimulating creation of a corporate strategic-planning activity.andP;  Seniormanagement's neglect of planning at many companies can be attributed to thetakeover mentality the swept U.S.andP;  companies through the 1980s.andP;  With thedemise of junk bond financing, says Dixon, &quot;maybe we will now get aredirection of our large and medium company managements on how to managecompanies again both for today and for the long term.&quot;andP;  That could mean moresupport for IS from senior management.andM;But many top IS executives aren't holding their breath waiting to be invitedinto the inner circle of top management.andP;  Says Primerica's Sherin, &quot;You can'tsit around and wait for someone to give you a job description or invite youto the table, because they're never going to do it.andP;  You have to create arole for yourself and fill it.andP;  And to do that, I can't sit on my butt in NewYork.andP;  I've got to get out and build partnerships with the businesses.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
