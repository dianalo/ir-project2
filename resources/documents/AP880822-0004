The newest tropical depression formed Monday in the middleAtlantic Ocean, east of the Lesser Antilles. The westward-movingsystem's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph around a centerroughly 325 miles east of the island of Guadeloupe, the NationalHurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables reported at 10:30 p.m.Monday. The depression was moving about 20 to 25 mph.   An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled toinvestigate the depression Tuesday morning.   Forecasters were most concerned with the Caribbean depression,which was moving west-northwest at about at about 15 to 20 mph andhad highest sustained winds of near 35 mph, the hurricane centersaid. The poorly organized depression was about 175 miles southeastof Kingston, Jamaica.   ``The one in the Caribbean probably has the best potential,''said forecaster Bob Case. ``Once it moves into the westernCaribbean, it seems more favorable for development.''   Some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours, Casesaid Monday.   ``Any time there's a tropical depression southeast of us at thistime of year, you need to pay attention,'' Case added.   Of the tropical activity, Case said it was ``quite normal'' atthis point in the hurricane season, which began June 1 and endsNov. 30.   ``We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said.   Little strengthening was expected in the newly formed depressionunless it slowed its forward speed, Case said.   Meanwhile, the most distant system, located about 200 milesnorthwest of Santo Antao in the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa,was moving northwest at 15 to 20 mph into colder water, and littlechange in strength was expected until a gradual decrease lateTuesday. Its highest sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph.   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when theirsustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74mph. There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricanestrength.</TEXT></DOC>
