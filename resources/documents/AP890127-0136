Butstill it's very difficult to offer the kind of airtight protectionthat students need,'' said Gary Marx, a spokesman for the AmericanAssociation of School Administrators.   Some officials are calling for greater restrictions on sales ofweapons, particularly automatic rifles, after last week's killingsin a Stockton, Calif., elementary school yard. A gunman, PatrickPurdy, murdered five children and wounded 30 people using an AK-47assault rifle before killing himself, police say.   ``It's not fair to say there's nothing you can do,'' said BillHonig, superintendent of the California school system. ``But it'spretty hard to do something about this kind of guy. He was going toget into the school somehow. Even with an armed guard, he would havejust shot past him.''   He added: ``The crime is that these weapons are around. How manymore innocent children are going to have to die before you decide todo something about the availability of weapons of war?''   Nevertheless, Honig said school personnel have been told to``beef up vigilance'' and he said he expects Gov. George Deukmeijianto sign a bill this year requiring every school to have a safetyplan. He vetoed it last year on cost grounds.   Police officers, security guards and even metal detectors arecommon sights at some high schools and middle schools besieged bydrug and gang related violence. But concern is now extending toelementary schools, which are increasingly common targets ofviolence.   In the past year, for example, a 19-year-old man killed two8-year-olds and wounded seven pupils and two teachers at OaklandElementary School in Greenwood, S.C. Laurie Dann shot and killed an8-year-old and wounded five other children at Hubbard WoodsElementary School in Winnetka, Ill., before wounding an adult andkilling herself.   On Thursday in Washington, a gunman opened fire into a crowd ofhigh school students, wounding four, in an incident police saidapparently grew out of an earlier argument.   Many educators worry about the expense, the effectiveness and thepsychological impact of turning schools into fortresses.   ``The only way you could guarantee the safety of elementaryschools from the criminally insane would be to build them likepenitentiaries,'' said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of theNational School Boards Association. And that would be ``unacceptablein terms of school environment, in terms of cost, in terms ofeverything,'' he said.   But Stuart Greenbaum, a spokesman for the National School SafetyCenter in Malibu, Calif., said most parents want to see precautionstaken rather than hear officials say ``sorry, we don't want to makeit an armed camp.'' And he has some suggestions.   Greenbaum, whose center was begun by the Reagan administrationand is financed by the Justice Department, said all schools shouldhave security officers or staff members responsible for security,equipped with walkie-talkies or some way of communicating what theysee.   Asked if that would have helped in Stockton, he replied, ``Theymight have been able to report seeing somebody on or about thecampus with a gun, maybe prevented the situation from being asdramatic as it was. Or in fact it may have even deterred theindividual from even coming on the campus.''   Greenbaum said the Stockton gunman entered through a gate at theback of the school grounds. ``You have to limit access points,'' hesaid. ``This is not to say make the school a fortress. But if youare obligated to have a variety of access points, they ought to bemonitored.''   The recent outbreaks of school violence are prompting someeducation groups to reconsider their historic reluctance to takestands on gun control and other issues not directly related toeducation.   ``Concern is intensifying. Many schools and nationalorganizations at this point will be considering whether they shouldhave positions on some of these issues'' such as gun control, saidMarx of the administrators group.   The school board association could approve a gun-controlresolution at its delegate meeting in April, Shannon said. ``Schoolboard members didn't think gun control was terribly relevant,'' hesaid. ``But now they're rethinking their positions.''   The National Education Association, the country's largest teacherunion, has long supported gun control.</TEXT></DOC>
