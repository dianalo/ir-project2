The direction is very appropriate and a desirable one. Such changes aren't without their risks, but we must proceed beyond the post-thalidomide period and put that tragedy in clear perspective and not have it remain the controlling factor in our drug-approval policy. Postponing the approval of a new drug is as significant a decision as approving one.    It seems indefensible to me that new drugs, which have been created by the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and are being used in Western Europe, Canada or Japan remain unavailable in this country. We have prevented patients, together with their physicians, from making an informed choice and assuming the risk for that decision. Every drug has the potentiality for producing undesired side effects in a certain percentage of the population and that includes the use of aspirin and certain vitamins. However, the decision to use these substances now resides with the individual. Similarly, the decision on the new breakthrough drugs for AIDS, cancer and vascular problems must be determined by an informed patient together with his or her physician.    Drugs must, of course, be therapeutically effective. The FDA must not relinquish its responsibility in this regard, but adult patients with their physicians must not be precluded from making decisions on the use of such medications. We cannot have a riskless society, for with decision making comes full responsibility. The issue must not be clouded by the financial potential for the pharmaceutical companies. It is clearly a question of whether the individual together with his or her physician can determine the medication to be used based upon various therapies available.    The FDA has the major role to play in providing the most up-to-date information available to all, but it should not arrogate for itself totally decision making regarding the use of such medications for adults. A free and mature society must allow significant latitude for its citizens in conjunction with physicians and pharmacists in medication decision making provided the drugs are therapeutically effective and appropriate for the condition.    Albert H. Soloway   Dean, College of Pharmacy   Ohio State University   Columbus, Ohio   ---   Your Oct. 5 article was a good overview of the impact of the new FDA regulations on drug development. However, it says that the immuno-supportive drug Imreg-1 is &quot;in dispute.&quot;    New developments in science are frequently accorded a high degree of skepticism. That skepticism is a natural product of the scientific process, and is generally beneficial in the long term, if for no other reason than that it serves to sharpen the scientific arguments of the proponents. Moreover, the development of immuno-supportive drugs is a new form of medical therapy for which there isn't an extensive data base of prior experience.    Therefore, it isn't unexpected that questions will be raised about new drugs, their mode of action and results. Those who are developing new drugs have the full burden of proof as to efficacy and justification for their use by the medical community. This is done by pursuing a rigorous, systematic demonstration of the effects of a new drug, a process that is not only intellectually challenging but costly as well.    Those who are watching these developments should base their judgments on all of the pertinent information, when it becomes available, and should avoid the dangers of prejudgment. Well-informed and well-intentioned criticism and skepticism will serve to benefit drug development. Careless judgments at any stage will slow achievement of this goal.    A. Arthur Gottlieb   President, Imreg Inc.   New Orleans   ---   We applaud the FDA's recognition of the needs of seriously ill patients. The &quot;investigative new drug for treatment&quot; (IND) rules may allow these patients greater access to new technologies and investigational drugs. They shouldn't also be the &quot;victims&quot; of a cumbersome drug-development process.    The Oct. 5 article states, however, that even our most advanced approach (interleukin-2 and activated killer cells) doesn't &quot;benefit the majority of patients&quot; and &quot;has many toxic side effects.&quot; This approach has shown promise in about 30% of patients who have no standard treatment option. Should these patients be denied this approach? Also, we have developed and published a clinical and laboratory protocol that significantly reduces toxicity.    Finally, health insurance does often pick up costs related to our programs. Our experience has been that about 90% of patients' clinical charges and about 30% of patients' laboratory research costs are reimbursed.    Louis P. Berneman   President, Biotherapeutics Inc.
