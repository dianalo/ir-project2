Manuel AntonioNoriega from power.   For his part, the general uses the populist appeal that hascharacterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects thespotlight from himself. Noriega says the issue is not whether hestays or goes, but Panama's dignity and self-determination.   This plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903essentially for Washington's convenience and where a newnationalism sparked by the Panama Canal treaties burns brightly.   In mid-May, Noriega consolidated support in the military byforming a Military Strategy Council of 20 loyal officers. Thecouncil, most of whose members are from the middle ranks, appearsto be at least on par with the senior officers who serve as chiefsof staff.   Allegations of drug-running and of involvement in thedecapitation murder of opposition figure Hugo Spadafora, whichspurred the movement to oust Noriega a year ago, have all butevaporated as issues among Panamanians.   Washington engineered the departures of dictators during thepast decade in Nicaragua, Haiti, the Philippines and Iran byconvincing them that their positions were untenable and they couldnot expect U.S. help against popular uprisings.   Noriega clearly does not feel threatened by his opposition,which comes from the genteel, educated middle and upper classesrather than oppressed masses.   It is an uprising with good manners, a rare phenomenon inCentral America. While dissidents in other countries form guerrillaarmies, Panamanians bang pots and pans, wave white handkerchiefsand hold brief general strikes.   ``If you want to see Panamanians dead in the streets of Panama,you will not see it,'' deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle saidin a recent meeting with reporters. ``Panamanians have risked asfar as they are willing to risk.''   Noriega has shut down opposition news media. His soldiers, whocan crack heads with the best of them when the occasion arises,have blocked most street demonstrations with intimidation or force.   Panamanian life is permeated by a ``them or us'' attitude thatpits workers against the wealthy opposition, a small and strugglingPanama against the Colossus of the North, and Panamanianindependence against U.S. meddling.   Noriega popularized the term ``rabi-blancos,'' which translatesroughly to ``white butts,'' a reference to the lighter skin commonto Panama's upper classes.   In a recent speech the general said ``the establishment,'' as hehas taken to calling the United States, will be responsible ifanything untoward happens to him.   American economic sanctions have lowered the comparatively highliving standard of many Panamanians but made no visible dent inNoriega's control. He has rejected the legitimacy of federalindictments in Florida charging him with drug trafficking and moneylaundering.   Panama and the United States appeared to be negotiating ondifferent levels _ the Panamanians wanting to talk about economicissues and American troop withdrawals, and Washington is willing todiscuss only dropping the indictments in exchange for Noriega'sdeparture.   Noriega says he will not respond to ultimatums and will not dealuntil sanctions are lifted and the additional American soldierstroops sent to Panama in April are pulled out.   The troops and sanctions remain in place. Noriega says that,early in the talks, U.S. negotiators gave him 48 hours to be out ofhis country.   Although Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last week thetalks had broken off, the United States is trying again, this timeenlisting Latin American democracies. Panamanian opponents ofNoriega had been urging that approach for weeks.   Military rule in Panama began when Col. Omar Torrijos seizedpower in a 1968 coup. He banned partisan political activity for thenext 10 years, and some party leaders went into exile or becameinactive.   The country has had eight civilian presidents and one civilianjunta since 1968, but power always has resided in the NationalGuard, recently renamed the Panama Defense Forces. Noriega commandsthe 15,000-member force, which includes the military and police.   Only Nicolas Ardito Barletta, in 1984, was elected by popularvote, and Noriega forced him out in 1985. Ardito Barletta had runas a member of the military-dominated Revolutionary DemocraticParty in an election many contend was fraudulent.   Civilian parties have not produced an alternative to militaryrule around whom people will rally, and Panama is not noted forpresidential stability. Presidents sometimes hold office only a fewweeks.   Roberto Chiari was president five times in 1960-1964 and earlierserved four days as second vice president.   The military and its Revolutionary Democratic Party have provedmore durable.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Joseph B.
