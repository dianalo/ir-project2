RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today let stand a rulingthat makes it easier for investors to sue their brokers over thecollapse in 1984 of a $3 billion oil and natural gas investmentfund.   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by three brokeragefirms seeking to force investors who lost money in the fund to sueindividually rather than as a group.   The case stems from the collapse of the Petro-Lewis fund, inwhich some 180,000 people purchased securities and limitedpartnerships from 1970 to 1984. The average initial investment by alimited partner was $8,600.   Petro-Lewis' financial problems began when a supply glut causedoil and gas prices to plummet in the early 1980s.   The fund revealed in February 1984 that its condition wascritical, cutting partnership distribution by as much as 50 percentand selling up to one-third of its reserves.   That prompted numerous lawsuits against Petro-Lewis, and alsoagainst brokers who helped market the fund.   Some investors settled with Petro-Lewis, which set up a $23.5million fund to handle the claims. But that agreement did notpreclude investors from suing their brokers.   The investors said the brokerage houses and individual brokers``knowingly or recklessly participated with Petro-Lewis indisseminating misleading information'' about the financialcondition of the funds.   At issue in the case acted on today is whether the investors canmaintain ``class action'' suits that permit them to apportion thecosts of fighting the case and divide up any court award.   Robinson-Humphrey Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. andPainewebber Inc. appealed a ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in Atlanta favoring the investors.   The appeals court said investors who claimed they were defraudedare arguing a common theory.   They allege ``that the Petro-Lewis shares, which were not tradedon the open market, could not have been marketed but for thedefendants' fraud,'' the appeals court said.   The appeals court rejected the brokers' argument that becauseinvestors relied on information given them orally by differentbrokers their claims should be tried separately.   ``The complaints alleged that the defendant brokerage firms andindividual officers engaged in a common course of conduct tomisrepresent ... the financial condition of Petro-Lewis,'' theappeals court said. ``These claims involve common issues thatclearly overwhelm the individual issues that may be present.''   It would be repetitive, wasteful and an unnecessary burden onthe courts to require separate trials, the appeals court added.   The cases are Robinson Humphrey vs. Sanders, 87-835, andPainewebber vs. Parker, 87-836.</TEXT></DOC>
