Eric Schwartz, program director of Asia Watch, a private U.S.human rights monitoring group, said there are demands in Malaysiato strip Vethamuthu David, opposition member of the MalaysianParliament and trade union official of his citizenship.   David is under fire, he said, for discussing with America'slargest Labor Federation, the AFL-CIO, its petition to cancel tradeconcessions given Malaysia under the U.S. system of preferences fordeveloping countries.   Schwartz quoted AFL-CIO officials as telling him talks withDavid did not influence their decision to file the petition.   David was detained on his return to Malaysia from attending theAFL-CIO convention as a guest last October and only recentlyreleased. He was among more than 100 people detained without triallast autumn under the Malaysian Internal Security Law.   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty said the union wanted Malaysiaremoved from the concessions group because, among other reasons, ofits violations of the rights of labor leaders to associate.``Malaysia's violation of the right of free association is notconfined to the illegal detention of David,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
