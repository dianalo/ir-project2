<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0306 </DOCNO><TEXT>The kinetic energy spectra of fragments (2 {le} Z {le} 14) from the interactionof 1 to 19 GeV protons and xenon nuclei have been measured using an internalgas jet target in the AGS main ring. It is observed that the shape ofthe energy spectra change radically as the incident proton energy decreasesfrom about 10 GeV while at energies between 10 and 19 GeV, the shapeof the spectra are identical to those measured using much higher protonenergies. The evolution of the lower energy spectra can be viewed asthe superposition of two components. One component is identical to thehigher energy spectra; the second component is symmetrical and consistentwith the fragment spectra emitted from a binary or asymmetric fissionprocess. 14 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
