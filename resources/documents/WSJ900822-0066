MCI said its network will be fully digital by the end of1991, two years ahead of schedule. Currently about 70% of thecarrier's network is digital, with most of the older analogtechnology in the West and Northwest. Now, that equipmentwill have to be written down.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Marketing is what this decision is about,&quot; said EdwardGreenberg, a telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp;Co. &quot;Now they can claim they are all digital -- and they canconvert at attractive prices.&quot;   Unlike US Sprint Communications, which boasts an allfiber-optics network, the MCI network will retain somedigital microwave facilities, primarily in the RockyMountains. Digitalization will help MCI compete againstSprint's marketing, which has focused on the greaterreliability and clarity of its fiber-optics network,completed in 1988. Sprint is a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc.   At the same time, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. hasmoved aggressively to upgrade its network. At the end of1988, the phone giant took a $6.7 billion write-down forolder technology and accelerated its plans for a network thatcarries voice and data traffic digitally -- that is, in thecomputer language of ones and zeros. Currently, ATandamp;T'snetwork carries all but a tiny amount of its switched trafficdigitally, and by 1992, all private lines will be digital aswell.   &quot;This removes the question of quality completely,&quot; said O.Gene Gabbard, executive vice president and chief financialofficer of MCI, about the plan announced yesterday. &quot;It isthe right thing to do and the right time to do it.&quot; Inaddition to strengthening MCI's marketing position, he saidthe conversion to a fully digital network will result in somesavings, as the older analog equipment is more expensive tooperate and maintain.   Mr. Gabbard, former chief executive officer of TelecomUSA, which merged into MCI earlier this month in a $1.25billion transaction, said the conversion is &quot;highly likely&quot;to result in a write-down of analog equipment in the thirdquarter. The company said the write-down could total between$500 million and $550 million.   &quot;The big question is the final amount,&quot; Mr. Gabbard said.The write-down, he said, &quot;is not a final decision at thispoint in time, but we're working diligently on it.&quot;   In response to the announcement about the possiblewrite-down yesterday morning, MCI stock fell about $2 a sharein active national over-the-counter trading, but later in theday recouped most of the decline to close at $33.625 a share,down $1.125.   As part of the digital-conversion plan, MCI is integrating3,000 miles of optical fiber that belonged to Telecom USA andhas signed a long-term agreement with WilliamsTelecommunications Group, a Williams Cos. unit, that givesthe companies access to each other's fiber networks. Terms ofthe agreement, which replaces many contracts between WilTeland MCI as well as Telecom USA, weren't disclosed.   For telephone users, digital technology delivers clearervoice connections and more accurate data transmission thananalog technology. The benefits, however, aren't asnoticeable to residential consumers, who must makeconnections through analog local telephone networks.   The long-distance carriers have an extra incentive toupgrade as telecommunications increasingly becomes a globalbusiness and U.S. companies try to maintain the technologicaledge.   Frank Governali, an analyst with First Boston Corp., saidMCI needs to become fully digital for competitive purposes,and &quot;will be getting there two years early at no incrementalcost.&quot; MCI said it expects to complete its upgrade withoutsignificantly increasing capital expenditures. The companysaid it plans to spend about $1.1 billion on its network nextyear.   For Williams, Tulsa, Okla., the new alliance with MCIprovides long-term benefits. Its WilTel unit is the nation'sfourth-largest long-distance carrier -- with an 11,000-milefiber optic network connecting most big cities. Over theshort term, the unit's 1991 revenue could shrink 10% to 15%over 1989 levels, WilTel said.   That's still better than many analysts had predicted whenthe MCI-Telecom USA merger was proposed in April. The twocompanies have been WilTel's biggest customers, and thatbusiness was expected to decrease drastically as Telecom USAtraffic migrated to the MCI network. Over the long haul,however, MCI's renegotiated contract sets revenue minimumsthat exceed the amounts in the earlier agreements.   &quot;Instead of worrying about losing its biggest customers,WilTel can sleep at night knowing they've got a positivestrategic partnership with MCI,&quot; said Jack Grubman, atelecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
