Visconti, director of the Office of Information Systems.andP;  He beganhis career as an examiner in the Buffalo region 16 years ago.andM;Not long ago, examiners audited the 9,200 credit unions manually.andP;  Now all600 examiners carry T3100s from Toshiba America Inc., Irvine, Calif.andP;  Thelaptops have 1.6M memory, modems and up to 20M hard-disk storage.andM;Examiners are expected to back up their own data.andP;  In case of equipmentfailure, a hardware support unit ships replacements overnight.andM;Audit information is collected on-site with a custom application.andP;  Theinformation then is transformed into finished reports using the integratedsoftware package Smart from Informix Software Inc., Menlo Park, Calif.andO;Reports are uploaded to a Tandem Computers Inc.andP;  VLX computer in theWashington office.andP;  About 9,500 forms are updated electronically every eightdays.andM;Visconti attributed the success of the laptop effort to the custom AutomatedCore Examinations (ACES) program, which was developed in-house.andP;  It took fourpeople five months to write.andP;  &quot;We didn't just give [examiners] a computer andsome software,&quot; Visconti said.andP;  &quot;We eliminated an extensive number of formsthat previously had to be carried around.&quot;andM;One-week training sessions were conducted in Dallas for the six NCUA regions.andO;Once the examiners finished training, they were required to use the T3100s.andO;Help lines were set up to answer questions.andM;&quot;You can teach a lot in a week, but we got a fair amount of questions for twomonths after the training,&quot; Visconti said.andP;  &quot;Most examiners were excitedabout the laptops.andP;  The longer their term of service, the higher theresistance.&quot;andM;NCUA now is working on its third update of ACES.andP;  &quot;With Smart, you can writeproject files in a high-level language, so maintenance can be done fairlyeasily,&quot; Visconti said.andM;He said it is difficult to measure the productivity improvement, as someexamination steps changed when auditing was automated.andP;  &quot;Our interest was inquality control,&quot; Visconti said.andP;  Providing credit unions with betteranalysis was another benefit of automation.andM;A user committee composed of examiners from the various regions is thecatalyst for change in the auditing system.andP;  &quot;We're getting requests forgraphics programs,&quot; Visconti said.andM;Ratings and narratives written by the examiners do contain financiallysensitive information, but much of the reporting is public domain.andM;NCUA regional offices have a dedicated network of 200 IBM PS/2s.andP;  The laptopscommunicate through the Tandem main-frame to the PS/2s.andP;  Tandem's PS-Mailallows examiners to communicate with one anotherandM;&quot;It seems we are required to keep data forever,&quot; Visconti said.andP;  &quot;We areconsidering optical storage because magnetic tape wears out.&quot;andP;  Agencycorrespondence may soon be stored optically.andM;The $6 million cost of the laptop automation, capitalized over five years, isbeing passed on to credit unions through operating fees.andP;  The cost includes amainframe upgrade.andM;Because 4,500 state-chartered credit unions also are ensured by the NCUA,there are plans to expand automated examinations to state supervisoryagencies.andM;The state examiners will go through nine weeks of classroom training,including a week of computer training, followed by on-the-job training inspreadsheets and data-bases using the same Smart software.andM;&quot;By giving field examiners an analytical tool, we have not only improvedstaff production but have put ourselves in position for the 1990s.andP;  Laptopshave had a large and positive impact,&quot; Visconti said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
