DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Taiwanese businessman implicated last yearin a major insider trading case with a junior analyst at avenerable Wall Street brokerage house has agreed to pay more than$25 million to settle civil charges.   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Wednesday thatFred C. Lee, 39, a Taiwanese national living in Hong Kong, agreedto pay $25.1 million in illegal profits and fines to acourt-appointed receiver.   The SEC sued Lee in New York last year, charging that he engagedin a $19 million insider trading scheme with Stephen K. Wang, thena 24-year-old analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s mergersdepartment.   Wang pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to one count each of securities,wire and mail fraud for taking about $200,000 to funnelconfidential information to Lee about at least 25 takeover dealsthat were being handled by Morgan at the time. There was noallegation of wrongdoing by Morgan, which suspended and later firedWang.   In a related development, the SEC settled a lawsuit withStandard Chartered Bank, a British bank that held $12.5 million ofLee's money at its Hong Kong branch.   The SEC got a federal judge in New York to order StandardChartered to turn over in New York an amount equal to the money Leehad on deposit in Hong Kong. The bank complied but sued, claimingit was being put in a kind of financial double jeopardy because Leewas suing for the release of his $12.5 million in the Hong Kongcourts.   The case went to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inManhattan, which had yet to rule.   With the surrender of Lee's $25 million, $300,000 was turnedover to the bank for expenses incurred in the New York and HongKong lawsuits.   ``The settlement of the case presents us with the outcome wewere seeking and we are therefore pleased that we were able todiscontinue our appeal,'' Martin Hayman, Standard Chartered Group'schief legal officer, said in a statement issued in New York.   The bank has 700 branches in 50 countries.   According to the SEC, Lee, made $19 million on trades forhimself and about 30 other people by allegedly trading on theinside information he got from Wang.   In an interview with SEC attorneys in Hong Kong last year, Leeadmitted using inside information supplied by Wang.   SEC officials said that until the record $650 million settlementby the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.pushed Ivan F. Boesky down the list to No. 2, the Lee-Wang case wasthe second-largest insider trading scheme ever prosecuted.   As part of the settlement, Lee agreed to pay $19 million into afund to reimburse investors defrauded by his scheme.   Lee also will pay $1.5 million in fines and $4.5 million in backtaxes with interest on his illegal trading profits.</TEXT></DOC>
