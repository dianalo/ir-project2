Thephotobioreactor permits the utilization of solar energy irrespectiveof the nature of the land or water surface and its fertility. The designand performance of the tubular photobioreactor has been fully described.Computer control of the biomass concentration in the reactor has beendeveloped and recently extended to achieve control of the carbon; nitrogen(C:N) ratio in the biomass. The control of the C:N ratio will be thekey to selection of the biomass composition desired, e.g. a high lipidcontent. Our studies on the photobioreactor show that the maximum thermodynamicefficiency of photosynthesis has been underestimated by a factor of 2.The costs of the photobioreactor process have been discussed. The capitalrequired is the major element in the cost but this may be substantiallyreduced as the technology develops. The primary aim of the present projectis to develop the photobioreactor and operate it under outdoor conditions.The efficiency of cultivation of Spirulina in the reactor using naturalsunlight will be compared with that obtained under artificial illumination.A second aim will be to study the application of the photobioreactorto the production of algal lipids, which may be used as sources of carbonand energy.
