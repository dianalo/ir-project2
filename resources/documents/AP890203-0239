The Labor Department said the civilian unemployment rate rose by0.1 percentage point from the December rate of 5.3 percent.   But the report showed continued strong growth, something analystshave predicted would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convincethe Federal Reserve Board to tighten its reins on credit.   The 408,000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed arevised gain of 221,000 in December and nearly matched November'srobust gain of 440,000 new jobs.   Anaysts had predicted that January job growth would be in the250,000 range and that any growth of more than 300,000 could troublethe markets.   ``It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said Davis Wyss,chief economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``Itsuggests we are going into the first quarter (of 1989) a lotstronger than we thought, the Fed is going to tighten (credit) andshort-term interest rates will be going up.''   In another report today signifying strength in the U.S. economy,the Commerce Department said orders to factories for manufacturedgoods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six monthsand a sharp upturn from the increases of 0.5 percent in November and2.0 percent in October.   The Labor Department said the labor force expanded by nearly900,000 people, with about 700,000 of them finding jobs, and that arecord 62.9 percent of the working-age population had jobs.   The unseasonably warm weather in much of the country helpedcontruction employment rise by 102,000 jobs last month, thedepartment said. Manufacturing employment also was up for the fourthmonth in a row, with 45,000 new January jobs split virtually evenlybetween the durable and non-durable goods industries.   There were 260,000 new jobs in the service-producing sector ofthe economy, with the 135,000 in retail trades accounting for morethan half of that figure. Service industries reported adding 75,000new jobs last month, down from an average monthly gain of 110,000 inthat sector throughout 1988.   In data closely watched for signs of inflation, the LaborDepartment reported that average hourly earnings of nonsupervisoryemployees climbed by 0.6 percent, or 9 cents, while average weeklyearnings rose 1.2 percent in January. Those figures are adjusted toreflect traditional seasonal changes in the employment picture.   In another sign of continued economic strength, the manufacturingwork week rose by 0.1 hour to 41.0 hours and average factoryovertime held steady at 3.9 hours.   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the department's Bureau of LaborStatistics, said it was difficult to interpret the January databecause of the seasonal pressures on the economy usually triggeredby colder weather and the passing of the Christmas season.   ``Supported by January's mild weather and an economy thatcontinues to grow, many of the usual seasonal job reductions did nottake place this year,'' Ms. Norwood said in testimony prepared forthe Joint Economic Committee of Congress.   Because of the 865,000 gain in the number of Americans seekingjobs last month, the unemployment rate edged up slightly despite thejob growth. Of the 123.4 million people in the labor force lastmonth, 116.7 million had jobs and 6.7 million were seekingemployment, the government said.   A separate government unemployment rate that includes the nearly1.7 million members of the armed services stationed in the UnitedStates also was 5.4 percent in January, like the civilian rate up0.1 percentage point from December.   In the civilian economy, the jobless rate among whites remainedunchanged in January at 4.6 percent; the rate was 4 percent forwhite men and 3.9 percent for white women.   The civilian unemployment rate among blacks climbed to 12 percentin January from 11.6 percent in December, while the jobless rateamong black teen-agers jumped to 34.5 percent from 29.6 percent.   There also was an increase in unemployment among Hispanics, from7.6 percent in December to 8.4 percent last month.   The robust report on the job market comes on the heels of severalother reports this week suggesting continued economic growth _ atrates some economists believer are too high to ward off inflation.   Today's unemployment report was the first of the Bush presidencyand came just four days before the Federal Reserve's open marketcommittee meets to set monetary targets for the new year.   Earlier this week, the government reported its index of leadingindicators, its main economic forecasting gauge, climbed 0.6 percentin December. Also out this week were reports that constructionspending rebounded and jumped 2.2 percent in December and thatpersonal income rose 0.9 percent in the final month of 1988.   Last week, the government reported a 2 percent gain in the grossnational product for the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 6.4 percentDecember jump in durable goods orders.   ``Their statistics on the economy continue to flash green,''Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said Thursday.``There is no stopping this economy.''</TEXT></DOC>
