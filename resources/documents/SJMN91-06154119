The sanctions -- worth about $165 million ayear -- imposed a 100 percent tariff on each imported computer using anythingabove an Intel Corp. 8088 microprocessor, a restriction that covers mostportable computers.;    But industry observers said the sanctions have beenrelatively ineffective because many Japanese firms were able to get around therestrictions by assembling computers in the United States instead of importingthem from Japan. For others, the sanctions simply became the cost of doingbusiness.;    Because the sanctions were ineffective and could have blocked anew trade agreement, the semiconductor industry has not objected to removingthem, government sources said. And the U.S. computer industry, hoping to domore business with Japanese firms, was eager to get them lifted, the sourcessaid.;    Spokesmen for both the chip and computer industries, however, saidthey didn't actively participate in discussions to remove the sanctions andsaid it was an issue for the two governments to work out.;    U.S. companieshave been slow to enter the lap-top and notebook markets, and the Japanese arethe acknowledged leaders. The removal of the sanctions could bring majorchanges in the portable computer market, some industry watchers predicted, inpart because it could help a number of U.S. firms move aggressively into thelap-top or smaller computer market for the first time by buying and resellingJapanese computers. It also could bring new Japanese players into the UnitedStates.;    If the sanctions are lifted, for example, Houston-based CompaqComputer Corp. could begin to sell its LTE portable -- made by Citizen ofJapan -- in the United States. It is now sold only in Europe.;    &quot;CertainlyCompaq and others are going to want to (license) products from Japan,&quot; saidBill Lempesis, an industry watcher based in Pleasanton. &quot;It is certainly intheir best interests to get the sanctions off.&quot;;    Lempesis and others saideven companies such as International Business Machines Corp., which has a verysmall notebook computer built for it and sold in Japan, could benefit fromremoving the sanctions.;    Display makers worried;  A spokesman in AppleComputer Inc.'s Washington office wouldn't comment on persistent rumors thecompany might have Sony Corp. of Japan manufacture a lap-top computer for itlater this year after the sanctions were lifted. He agreed in theory, however,that lifting the sanctions could give a number of options to U.S. companiesconsidering the lap-top market.;    But at least one sector of the electronicsindustry is worried about removing the sanctions.;    The American DisplayManufacturers Association, a group of small U.S. makers of flat-paneldisplays, last year filed a complaint with the International Trade Commissionalleging large Japanese companies were selling advanced display screens in theUnited States for prices below their cost, a practice known as dumping. Thedisplays are used in portable, lap-top and notebook computers.;    Thespokesman for the group, Washington-based attorney Paul Rosenthal, was worriedthat once the sanctions were off, there would be no reason for Americancompanies to buy U.S.-made screens, particularly if they were just importingnotebook or lap-top computers &quot;already made&quot; from Japan.;    &quot;What thesanctions did was make it unwise for U.S. companies to move their assemblyfacilities to Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;If the sanctions are off, there is very littleinhibition against buying products offshore or moving offshore. And that's badnews for us.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  VALERIE RICE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910602  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  686  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 2, 199100154119,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
