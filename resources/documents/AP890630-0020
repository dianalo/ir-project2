A middle-aged man slaughters his cattle and cuts down his bananatrees before hanging himself.   And a father wraps his son's hands in kerosene-soaked rags beforesetting them afire because he suspected the 10-year-old of stealing20 shillings _ the equivalent of $1.   Such violence is increasingly common in this East African nation,say the psychiatrists, sociologists and social workers who blamerapid social changes for the tales of destruction, mutilation anddeath that appear regularly in local newspapers.   The traditional underpinnings of this tribal-based society arebeing eroded, these experts say, as young men migrate to citieswhere jobs are rare and as relationships based on money suffuse arural society ruled only a generation ago by kinship.   ``It's a whole question of adjustment to dramatic change,'' saidPhilista Onyanga, a sociologist at the University of Nairobi.``We're talking about change within a generation _ urbanization andmoving to a money-based society. It used to be that authority wasbased purely on age and gender.''   In the new Kenya, respected relatives and village elders are lesslikely to be consulted by, or even be available to, men and womenfeeling overwhelmed by poverty and family problems. Old folkloreprovides few answers to those under new kinds of stress.   The result is a society less able to cope with rising prices, toofew jobs, too little land and increasingly elusive educationalopportunities, say Onyanga and others.   Probably the most important support system to deteriorate hasbeen the local group of aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents,cousins and siblings who provided emotional, physical and financialsupport.   ``The extended family system has been the basis of securitytraditionally in this country throughout generations,'' said SamGatere, a psychologist. He said its disintegration has left peoplefeeling ``very insecure.''   ``My father, if he did not have a job, knew that his brotherwould take care of him,'' said Gatere. ``Today, not at all. Now it'severyone for himself.''   Men have left rural areas in search of salaried work in thecities, leaving the women to fend for themselves and their families,run the farm and see to community matters traditionally dealt withby the man.   ``That straight away means the family dynamics change. The headof the family shifts from the man to the wife. This is most strangefor Africa,'' said Gatere, who produces a nationally broadcast radioshow on social problems.   University education, traditionally seen as a way to get off thefarm and into a salaried position, is becoming increasinglyexpensive. And with a population expected to double in the next 16years, an education no longer provides the promise of a better lifeit once did.   To accomodate the number of potential wage earners entering themarketplace, Kenya says it would have to create 6.5 million jobs bythe turn of the century _ nearly twice the current number.   ``Now education means nothing because of the population boom,''said Onyanga. ``The situation is very frustrating when theuneducated father finally gets his kids to school, they end upwithout a job.''   Stagnant salaries and rising prices add their own stresses.   ``The coffee picker who loses his job and kills his family, thenhimself, sees no other alternative. He has no home and no one willcare for him,'' said Gatere.   ``They end up so frustrated, they feel there is no reason tolive,'' said Mbogori.</TEXT></DOC>
