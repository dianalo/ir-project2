MickeyLeland and 15 other people aboard. U.S. officials said no survivorswere found.   The plane crashed in Gambela, a town in southwestern Ethiopia 30miles from the Sudanese border and 60 miles from the refugee campwhere the aircraft was headed, said James Haley, a spokesman forthe U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.   The plane went down in rugged highlands near two dirt airstripsthe pilot may have been trying to reach because of bad weather nearthe refugee camp.   ``The crash site was located. U.S. helicopters put down. Theyhave confirmed 13 dead, and the presumption is that the other threeare also dead,'' Haley said in a telephone interivew.   In Washington, the Pentagon issued a statement saying U.S.helicopters discovered the crash site, ``Air Force jumpers jumpedout of a UH-60 helicopter and ... they confirmed there were nosurvivors at the site.''   However, spokesman Mel Sudin, who read the statement, also saidthe jumpers accounted for only 13 people and that it appeared thatthree were missing.   Leland, a Texas Democrat who heads the House Select Committee onHunger, was accompanied by eight Americans. They included threemembers of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three workersfor the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the wife ofone of the AID officials.   President Bush said in Washington, ``Barbara and I were trulysaddened to hear that the discovery of Mickey Leland's aircraftrevealed that apparently there were no survivors of this tragicaccident. Mickey Leland and the other members of his travelingparty, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause_ trying to feed the hungry.   ``I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for manyyears. His sense of compassion and desire to help those in need hasaided millions of people from Houston to Addis Ababa.''   The twin-engine Twin Otter vanished Aug. 7 in bad weather. Therescue workers did not immediately speculate on the cause of thecrash.   However, Gambela and the village of Dembidola just to the northhad been an early focus of the search because there are two rough,dirt airstrips nearby.   The pilot may have diverted to one of those strips because ofheavy clouds and low visibility at Leland's intended destination.   The Ethiopian government said peasants had heard a light planecircling one and possibly two other dirt strips 90 miles southeastof Gambela on Monday.   Since the plane disappeared, an aerial and ground search by U.S.and Ethiopian personnel had been carried out daily. At one point,weather satellites detected what appeared to be airplane distresssignals far from the intended flight path, but a search of thoseareas turned up nothing.   The seven others on board were all Ethiopian. They included athree-member crew, an officer with the Foreign Ministry, an officerof Ethiopia's Research and Rehabilitation Commission, anotherofficial and an employee of AID.   Earlier Sunday, U.S. and Ethiopian rescuers had extended theirsearch for Leland's Twin Otter airplane into eastern Sudan. OnSaturday, searchers had concentrated their efforts on valleys andmountains in a 100,000-square-mile area about the size of Wyoming.   Another Embassy spokesman, John Guerra, said four U.S. ArmyBlackhawk helicopters and six other aircraft searched Sunday alongthe path the plane was to take to the camp in Fugnido, 480 milessouthwest of Addis Ababa.   Ethiopian authorities said it was cloudy in the search area andvisibility was poor Sunday. Bad weather had dogged the operationsince it began Tuesday.   Fugnido is the site of one of four refugee camps in southwesternEthiopia run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Fugnidohouses more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and a civilwar in their own country.   A C-141 Hercules aircraft with additional personnel andequipment arrived Saturday to help in the search.   The reinforcements, including 100 more searchers, were sentmainly to relieve fliers of two Hercules already involved in theeffort. They had been flying from dawn to sunset since they arrivedfrom West Germany on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
