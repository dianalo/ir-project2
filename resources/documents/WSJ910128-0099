This is the picture that emerges from Saturday'sannouncement that the cases of 71 people arrested inconnection with the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations hadbeen completed. In this second round of sentencing, studentleader Wang Dan, 23 years old, was given four years in jailand social critic Liu Xiaobo was released, despite once beingvilified in the official press as &quot;a key organizer ofcounterrevolutionary insurrection.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Sixty-three other offenders accused of minor crimes werereleased without prosecution because they &quot;showedrepentance,&quot; according to the announcement by China'sofficial Xinhua news agency. But harsher sentences werereserved for two older intellectuals considered to beanti-government agitators.   Ren Wanding, a veteran political activist in his mid-40swho was jailed from 1979-83 for participating in theDemocracy Wall movement, earlier was sentenced to seven yearsin jail. Bao Zunxin, a historian from a government think tankwho rallied other intellectuals behind the studentdemonstrators, was given five years.   Other sentences announced Saturday included: Guo Haifeng,a Beijing University student leader who authorities said wasarrested as he tried to set fire to an armored vehicle, fouryears; Yao Junling, believed to be a student, two years; ChenLai and Li Chenghuan, identities unknown, convicted andreleased. Most of those who underwent trial were accused of&quot;counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement.&quot;   &quot;This is pretty light sentencing by Chinese standards,&quot;said a foreign diplomat. &quot;My guess is that they are prettyconfident they have the general security situation sewn uphere and the people they're letting out can't do anything.&quot;   Both Messrs. Wang and Liu are well-known in the West. ManyWestern politicians, academics and human rights activistshave contacted Chinese authorities on their behalf sincetheir arrests after the June 4, 1989, slaughter ofdemonstrators in Beijing. Since he has already served 19months in jail, Mr. Wang, who was No. 1 on the government'smost-wanted list of student activists, will be eligible forrelease in less than 30 months.   Following his arrest, Beijing was full of rumors that Mr.Wang was tortured in jail. Xinhua on Saturday said he wastreated leniently as a result of &quot;confessing his own crimesand exposing others.&quot;   Mr. Liu, a philosopher who returned from ColumbiaUniversity in New York to participate in the demonstrations,was said to have &quot;showed repentance and performed some majormeritorious service.&quot;   Mr. Liu had been criticized by China's official press morethan any other offender. The Communist Party's newspaper,People's Daily, accused him of writing articles that were&quot;anti-communist, anti-people, so-called high-tonnage bombs.&quot;He was accused of being a key link between anti-governmentgroups based in America and student demonstrators inTiananmen. Based on these denunciations, foreign diplomatssaid, Mr. Liu's release came as a shock.   Human rights activists said it is unclear how many peopleremain in jail awaiting trial. Nobody knows how many werearrested. Chinese authorities said 2,578 people were arrestedin Beijing in the 24 days following June 4. But thousands ofothers are believed to have been arrested both in Beijing andin the provinces. Official newspapers reported that inJiangsu province alone, 3,000 people were arrested during athree-day period in July 1989.   The government has publicly announced the release of onlyabout 1,000 offenders.   The only other official announcement of trials came onJan. 5 when seven protesters were sentenced to jail termsranging from two to four years; two other protesters werereleased.   Human rights activists believe that many workers have beengiven harsh sentences of 10 years or more for participatingin the demonstrations. The names of most arrested workers areunknown in the West, and the dispositions of cases involvingworkers haven't been made public.   And foreign diplomats say they are awaiting thedisposition of the cases of four additional well-knownpeople. They include two government insiders, Bao Tong, 57,and Gao Shan, 34, and two longtime political activists, WangJuntao, 32, and Chen Ziming, 37.</TEXT></DOC>
