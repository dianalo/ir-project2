 Apple hasdeveloped a device-independent AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format), whichshould see a lot of use in the future.andP;  System 7 is also rumored to have bigchanges in sound management.andM;But there's no need to wait for these projected developments any longer.andP;  Youcan start working with sound now, using inexpensive hardware and software,and achieve results that would have been the exclusive domain of professionalsound designers just a few short years ago.andP;  Whether you want to enhance aHyperCard training stack or just add a little pizzazz to your own Mac, soundis one area in which a small investment in time and money can pay bigdividends.andM;What You Need to KnowandM;When you work with graphics on the Mac, your data is in the form of pictures.andO;When you work with sound, your data is in the form of samples.andP;  A sample issimply a digitized representation of a sound, much as a movie is a sequenceof individual pictures that create the illusion of motion.andP;  Similarly, asample is made by taking many different audio &quot;snapshots&quot; and stringing themtogether.andP;  It's the same basic process used in digital recording andmastering to create compact discs.andP;  Figure 1 shows how a sound is translatedinto sampled numeric data that the Mac understands.andM;As with motion pictures, the more snapshots you take, the more informationyou capture, and the more realistic the end result.andP;  The sampling rate isexpressed in kilohertz, which means thousands of cycles per second.andP;  A22-kilohertz sample, then, is recorded at 22,000 cycles per second.andP;  The morecycles per second, the more realistic the sound.andP;  And the higher the samplingrate, the more data you have, which means bigger files.andM;Figure 2 shows the trade-off between fidelity and file size that you canexpect at different Mac sampling rates.andP;  For technical reasons, you alwayshave to sample a sound at a rate equal to at least twice the highestfrequency that you want to play back.andP;  Thus, a 22-kilohertz sample (which isthe best a Mac can do without the addition of extra hardware such asDigi-design's Audiomedia board for the Macintosh II family) translates toabout 11 kilohertz as heard by the human ear.andP;  (The upper limit of humanhearing is around 20 kilohertz.)andP;  When you record samples at a lowerkilohertz setting, you lose the high-frequency subtleties of the sound--thestuff that distinguishes hi-fi from medium-fi.andM;Sampled sound on the Mac shares something else with graphics: a number ofdifferent and sometimes incompatible formats.andP;  You should know about thefollowing three types: standard snd resources, which are what Mac users withSystems 6 use to run their beep into monkey's chatter or a clink-clank;HyperCard and resources, which are in a different format than System sndresources and must be converted before they'll work; and finally, soundcaptured as data instead of as a resource.andP;  The latter format is the oneFarallon Computing's SoundEdit program uses automatically to save sounds,although it can also save them as resources.andP;  Because the most popularshareware program for handling such data files is Bruce Tomlin's SoundMaster,we'll refer to them as SoundMaster files.andM;You can standardize the format of sound files by converting from one type toanother.andP;  Table 1 shows what you need to perform conversions.andP;  The table isbased on information from a HyperCard stack by Bob Caceres of The BostonComputer Society.andP;  This stack is part of a complete Sound Utils package thatalso includes copies of all the shareware programs you need to work withsound.andP;  See the &quot;Shareware Resources&quot; sidebar to find out where to getindividual utilities or the entire packagE.andM;Sound DevicesandM;If you want to edit sounds or capture your own, the place to start is withFarallon Computing's MacRecorder and its accompanying software (see &quot;StartUp&quot;January '90 for a review).andP;  Because MacRecorder uses your Mac's availablememory for sampling, you'll want 2 or more megabytes of RAM.andP;  It might gettight with only 1 megabyte -- samples must fit into memory to play.andP;  Theamount of memory you have determines the maximum length of time you canrecord any one sound; when you run out of RAM, your time's up.andP;  So be sure toboot with MultiFinder off.andM;A hard disk helps too.andP;  A 20-second sample that was recorded at 22 kilohertzwill eat up 400K of disk space.andP;  That's why HyperCard stacks containing soundresources grow big so quickly.andM;Finally, use HyperCard 1.2.1 or later for stacks that feature sound.andP;  Version1.0 is notorious for crashing during sample playback.andM;The MacRecorder consists of three parts: the sampler proper, which is amouse-sized digitizer with a built-in microphone plus inputs for externalsources; the SoundEdit application for sophisticated sample editing; and twostacks, HyperSound and HyperSound ToolKit, for creating and manipulatingsamples in HyperCard.andM;SoundEdit's interface beats that of many professional sound applications, andit's intuitive enough that you can get started without reading the manualfirst.andP;  But the documentation is so good you could use it to make SoundEditan excellent learning lab.andM;SoundEdit handles botht sound data files and snd resources.andP;  The graphicwaveform display conveys a lot of information, and you'll soon learn torecognize the beginnings and endings of syllables, drumbeats, and otherreference points.andM;Each sample may me played in full or in part, and the standard Macintoshclick-drag and Cut, Copy, and Paste editing lets you manipulate pieces ofsound.andP;  The Effects menu contains a long list of sonic modifiers such asecho, backwards, and bender.andP;  Some are useful and others are useless, but allare easy to try.andP;  And they're all undoable.andP;  (For more about SoundEdit'seffects, see &quot;Can We Talk?&quot; June '88).andM;Other HardwareandM;MacRecorder comes with an internal microphone, but it's nothing to write homeabout.andP;  You can dramatically improve the quality of your own live sampling ifyou invest in a better microphone and plug it into the Mic jack on theMacRecorder.andM;By the same token, the Macintosh's internal speaker doesn't even rate ablack-and-white postcard.andP;  Using a mini-amplifier and speakers makes a worldof difference.andM;You can get very good results from tools available at your local Radio Shack.andO;Here are some useful items from the 1990 catalog:andM;Microphone: PZM (33-1090), $49.95.andM;Amplifier: Stereo Micro Amplifier (31-1982), $29.95 -- remember that theMac's speaker-output jack is powerful enough only for miniheadphones; soconnect the Mac speaker-output jack to the MacRecorder Line jack.andM;Minispeakers: Minimus 0.3 (40-1250), $14.95 each -- the speakers are aparticularly good match for the Micro Amplifier in that they're tiny andmatch Mac Plus and SE output tone well.andM;Speakers: Minimus-7 (40-2030/40-2045), $49.95 each -- goof full-range two-wayminispeaker.andM;Amplified speakers: (40-166), $19.95 per pair -- 2-watt, battery-poweredspeakers.andM;For slightly heftier investment, &quot;satellite&quot; speaker systems (such as the$499 Cambridge SoundWorks Ensemble) combine inobtrusively placed woofer(bass) units with small high-frequency speakers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
