The index of leading indicators fell 0.1% after climbing a revised 0.5% in April, 0.2% in March and 0.8% in February, the Commerce Department said. The April increase previously was put at 0.2%.    The department said the decline reflected lower stock prices, a drop in the inflation-adjusted value of orders for new plant and equipment, an upturn in new claims for unemployment compensation, a shorter average workweek and a decline in new building permits.    A rule of thumb among some economists says it takes three consecutive months of declines in the index to forecast an economic downturn. But other economists ignore the index -- a compilation of 11 economic indicators -- saying it has an unfortunate tendency to predict recessions that never arrive.    Separately, the Commerce Department estimated that sales of newly built single-family homes fell 0.3% in May to an annual rate of 658,000 from a 660,000 rate in April. But because of statistical error and the small size of its sample, the department said the actual change could have been anywhere from an 8.7% increase to a 9.3% decline.    The department also said that the median price of a new house sold in May was $110,000, down from $111,000 in April but above the $104,900 reported for May 1987. The average price was $135,900, up from $135,600 in April and from $126,600 in May 1987.    The figures in both reports are seasonally adjusted. Before seasonal adjustments, the department estimated that 294,000 new houses were sold in the first five months of 1988, down 7.8% from 319,000 in the same period of 1987.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 0.1% decline in the index for May and a 0.5% increase for April.
