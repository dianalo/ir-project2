<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0314 </DOCNO><TEXT>The electron temperature gradient in tokamak geometry is shown to drivea short wavelength lower hybrid drift wave turbulence due to the unfavorablemagnetic curvature on the outside of the torus. Ballooning mode theoryis used to determine the stability regimes and the complex eigenfrequencies.At wavelengths of order the electron gyroradius the polarization is electrostaticand the growth rate is greater than the electron transit time aroud thetorus. At longer wavelengths of order the collisionless skin depth thepolarization is electromagnetic with electromagnetic vortices producingthe dominant transport. The small scale electrostatic component of theturbulence produces a small by (m/sub e/m/sub i/)/sup 1/2/ drift waveanomalous transport of both the trapped and passing electrons while thec/{omega}/sub pe/ scale turbulene produces a neo-Alcator type transportfrom the stochastic diffusion of the trapped electrons. 15 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
