PAGE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson has completed hisjourney from religious broadcaster to presidential candidate andback, returning to the Christian Broadcasting Network as co-host of``The 700 Club.''   ``For better or worse, the health of this ministry depends onthis program. It is our bread and butter,'' Robertson said Mondayafter the first broadcast of the revamped program, which includedthe introduction of a new co-host, Sheila Walsh, a gospel singerand songwriter from Scotland.   Robertson, who founded CBN, left the network in 1986 to pursuehis political goals. In 1987, when the Southern Baptist ministerformally announced his candidacy for the Republican presidentialnomination, he installed his son, Tim Robertson, as president ofCBN and one of three hosts of the program.   During that period, donations dwindled. CBN officials blamed thedecline on scandals in other television ministries, changes in``The 700 Club'' format and a poor economy in oil states where manyCBN donors live. Robertson later said his absence was the reasonfor the drop.   During that time, CBN laid off more than 1,000 employees _ abouthalf its workforce _ and cut its operating budget by more than 40percent.   Ratings for ``The 700 Club'' also dropped, giving rise to theformat unveiled Monday.   Gone were the dramatic recreations of religious conversions andthe public prayers for healing that marked the old program.   Robertson said the new formula for the 90-minute program will beone-third news, one-third ministry and teaching and one-thirdlifestyle features.   Robertson still plans to campaign for Vice President George Bushduring the presidential election.   ``When I leave that desk,'' he said, pointing to the studio deskfrom which he delivers the news and commentary segment of theprogram, ``I am no longer a newsman. When I'm there, I will try toreport the news fairly.''</TEXT></DOC>
