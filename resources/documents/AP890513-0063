It was the first pullout of permanent Soviet forcessince a 1968 invasion to crush Communist-led reform.   A 6{-mile column of Soviet army vehicles headed home from thenorth Moravian city of Olomouc, according to state-run media. Abrief ceremony sponsored by local Communist Party officials markedthe departure. The reports did not say how many soldiers and tankswere in the procession.   The partial withdrawal of Soviet soldiers was announced inDecember by Mikhail S. Gorbachev as part of an overall plan to cutthe Red Army by half a million men by 1991.   Gorbachev's promised withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops and5,000 tanks from East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by 1991began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 T-64tanks from a base in southern Hungary. Soviet troops and tanks havealso begun to leave East Germany.   Until Alexander Dubcek launched the short-lived ``PragueSpring'' reforms in 1968, the Kremlin had no troops or tankspermanently stationed in Czechoslovakia.   Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops and tanks first entered thecountry for lengthy maneuvers in mid-1968 in a sign of increasingnervousness among Czechoslovakia's Communist allies over Dubcek'sreforms.   The Warsaw Pact forces withdrew to just over the Czechoslovakborder in July 1968, but returned Aug. 20. The invasion crushedreforms and led to the expulsion of Dubcek and nearly 500,000others from the Communist Party.   According to Western estimates, the Soviets have about 80,000soldiers in Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak chief of staff, Gen.Miroslav Vacek, said in February the Soviets will withdraw 5,300soldiers, 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990. Fourbattalions numbering some 1,500 men will be withdrawn this year.</TEXT></DOC>
