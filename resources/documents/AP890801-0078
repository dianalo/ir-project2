The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential andgovernment construction activity fell 0.8 percent in June to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.7 billion, the lowest levelsince October. The decline followed a 0.6 percent gain in May and a0.8 percent drop in April.   Construction of new housing units dropped 1.2 percent to anannual rate of $136.6 billion, the lowest level in three years. Itwas the fifth consecutive monthly decline.   A year-long campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to fightinflation with higher interest rates ended this spring. Starting inearly June, the central bank reversed course and has easedshort-term rates three times, once in June and twice last month.   Long-term rates, over which the Fed has less influence, are alsodown. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.81 percent lastweek, the lowest in two years, according to the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp.   Economists expect rates to continue falling gradually and, as aresult, construction activity to pick up. But, softness in economicgrowth overall will prevent a strong surge, they said.   ``I don't see a big rebound. ... At least in the housing sector,I think we have several more slow months to come while people waitto see whether we're going to have a recession or not,'' saideconomist James Christian of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions.   ``If you can't sell them, you shouldn't build them,'' he said.   Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9percent above the same period in 1988, an increase that doesn'teven make up for inflation in construction costs.   The weakness in June included a 4.8 percent drop in publicconstruction, which accounts for about one-fifth of constructionactivity, to an annual rate of $80.6 billion. The decline includeda 3.6 percent drop in spending for highways and streets, thebiggest government category.   Spending on single-family homes fell 1.3 percent to an annualrate of $113.6 billion, while multifamily construction was down 0.9percent to $23 billion.   Non-residential construction rose 2.8 percent to a rate of$100.3 billion. That reflected strength in industrial projects, up4.3 percent; hotels and motels, up 6.8 percent; office building, up1.8 percent, and other commercial projects such as shoppingcenters, up 2.5 percent.   Economist John Savacool of the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm inBala Cynwyd, Pa., said activity is cooling in office and retailbuilding, but still strong in factory construction, which issupported by manufacturers' success in selling more goods overseas.   ``The one thing that is restraining additional investment in theindustrial sector is that everyone is looking over their shoulderto see if there's a recession coming,'' he said. ``The people incharge of investment are trying to be very cautious because theyrealize we're going to get a rude surprise sooner or later.''   He predicted a small increase in construction activity in thesecond half of this year, ``but not enough to get excited about.''</TEXT></DOC>
