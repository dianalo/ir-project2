Petro-Canada, Canada's second-largest crude oil refiner,said these steps, together with a plan to convert anotherrefinery to the production of asphalt and lubricants, shouldreduce refining capacity by about 80,000 barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Petro-Canada's &quot;downstream&quot; operations in refining andmarketing had a loss of 106 million Canadian dollars (US$91.4million) in the first nine months of 1991, and the companysaid it plans to take a C$369 million charge againstfourth-quarter earnings to reflect a write-down in the bookvalue of some of the refining and marketing assets.   Analysts said Petro-Canada's decision to shut downcapacity is a first glimmer of hope the Canadian downstreamindustry has seen in more than a year. Beset by heavyCanadian government taxes, an influx of lower-priced crudefrom U.S. refiners, the recession and domestic price wars,the industry also suffered heavily early last year whenforced to dispose of high-priced crude inventories at low,post-Gulf War, refined-product prices.   &quot;Now that the industry has switched to {last-in,first-out} accounting, we won't see those big inventorylosses this year,&quot; said Denis Mote, an industry analyst withMaison Placements Inc., a Toronto investment dealer. &quot;Buttaxes are a little higher, and demand isn't improving. Biglosses are piling up at the refinery level and at the gasstation level.&quot;   But analysts said the closure and conversion of refineriesaccounting for 80,000 barrels of refined product daily isonly a drop in the bucket. Canadian refining capacitycurrently totals about 1.9 million barrels daily, and someargue that at least 10% of that total will need to disappearbefore downstream companies notice an improvement in theirbottom line.   The intensive downstream competition and flagging demandis hurting all of Canada's major players. Imperial Oil Ltd.has said it expects to report its first-ever annual loss, andsome analysts believe that the company, 70%-owned by ExxonCorp., could also shut down refining capacity. Imperialofficials couldn't be reached.   Meanwhile, Shell Canada Ltd. reported that 1991 net incomefrom continuing operations shrank to C$12 million from C$317million a year earlier. Its downstream operations posted aC$62 million loss for the year, down from a profit of C$153million in 1990. The company is 78%-owned by RoyalDutch/Shell Group.   Earlier in the week, Canadian Turbo Inc., a WesternCanadian refiner and marketer, said that as a result ofrecord losses, it has retained financial advisers to help thecompany explore &quot;possible strategic transactions.&quot; EricSprott, its chairman, wouldn't confirm or deny reports thatthe company could close gas stations, but said &quot;significantsteps&quot; are required to deal with overcapacity.   If Turbo does proceed with asset sales, it will find thatthere appears to be a glut of gas stations on the market.Already up for sale are the 1,500 stations acquired by LasmoPLC as part of its purchase of Ultramar PLC. And now,Petro-Canada will divest or close more than a third of its3,500 stations nationwide within the next two to three years.Industry observers say there are few buyers emerging forthese assets.   Philippe Hervieu, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deaconin Montreal, concluded that the downstream industry needs tosee an economic recovery before its own performance willimprove.</TEXT></DOC>
