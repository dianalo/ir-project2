A congressional firestorm over scrapping the Osprey can only befueled by Cheney's turn toward the Sikorsky Aircraft CH-53E SuperStallion, the western world's largest helicopter, lawmakers say.   The Osprey is designed to take off like a helicopter and flylike an airplane. The Marine Corps wants it for surprise,long-range amphibious assaults. The government has invested $2billion in its development.   Cheney, however, says that the Osprey must go as part of hismove to cut $10 billion in spending under the budget agreementbetween Congress and the Bush administration.   The Navy rebuffed congressional demands in 1987 for groundingthe Super Stallion and instead ordered Sikorsky to conduct a $9million review to determine if a design flaw triggered sevencrashes between June 1984 and January 1987 that left 20 Marinesdead.   That review, due last summer but delayed by additional Navyrequests, was delivered to the Pentagon in early February with thecompany declaring the helicopter safe.   Dissatisfied Pentagon officials sent it back to the company lastmonth for further tests, according to Bill Armstrong, spokesman forthe Naval Air Systems Command.   ``We felt there were some areas of the TEP (test and evaluationprogram) that had to be amplified,'' Armstrong said.   Sikorsky says it will resubmit the review this summer. ThePentagon does not expect a final determination on the study untilOctober, which means debate over Super Stallion and Osprey fundingfor fiscal 1990 will rage on without the benefit of thehelicopter's safety report.   Some Super Stallion critics are ready to fight Cheney's plan tobuy more of the helicopters in the absence of a Pentagon-approvedSikorsky review.   ``Until they can answer the question and do the review ... weneed to put this on hold,'' said Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., a formerMarine and a leading critic of the Super Stallion.   But Cheney's request for more Super Stallions, which wouldrevive a program that was scheduled to end in the 1990 budget,indicates Pentagon confidence in the helicopter, Sikorsky officialsmaintain.   ``They're anticipating that the good name of the helicopter willbe gotten back, as the results of the testing show,'' said KenKelly, a Sikorsky vice president in charge of the Super Stallionprogram. ``In a way, they have built in an anticipatory approval byNavAir of the work that has been done.''   Under the Reagan administration's budget, the Super Stallionprogram was to have ended in the 1990 budget year with just threemore helicopters ordered.   But to compensate for the planned elimination of the newOspreys, Cheney wants to buy 23 Super Stallions for 1990 and isexpected to ask for 23 annually in each subsequent year well intothe 1990s, according to congressional and industry sources. TheSuper Stallions cost about $16 million each.   Although the tilt-rotor Osprey could take off like a helicopterand fly like a plane, military strategists believe the SuperStallion can handle much of the Osprey's heavy-lift mission for theMarines and Navy.   The Super Stallion is a modified version of the Vietnam eraCH-53D Sea Stallion. The Super Stallion, with its larger rotors anda third engine, can lift up to 18 tons, about double the old SeaStallion's capacity.   But critics say the 16{-ton helicopter is simply too big andshould have been designed from scratch, not modified from thesmaller Sea Stallion.   ``It was designed too large and there's no way you can make itsafe because of its size,'' said Bates.</TEXT></DOC>
