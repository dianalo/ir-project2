 Supreme Court ruling exempted states fromsoftware copyright infringement suits, Adapso and the Software PublishersAssociation (SPA) have been lobbying Congress hard to change the law.andM;The House Judiciary Committee heard testimony earlier this month on a billthat seeks to redress concerns of the software industry and others aboutstate copyright infringements.andP;  Adapso and SPA officials are hoping that thebill, HR 1131, and a similar bill before the Senate, S198, will become lawbefore the end of the year.andM;A Supreme Court ruling earlier this year in the case of BV Engineering vs.andO;University of California at Los Angeles upheld a lower-court decisionexempting states.andP;  Software industry officials said the ruling allows stategovernment agencies and universities to copy software without any fear oflegal action.andM;In that case, BV Engineering of Riverside, Calif., sued UCLA afterdiscovering that the university had made copies of software programs anddocumentation that the company had sold to UCLA.andM;The basis for the court ruling against the software company lies in aconflict between the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, which is generallyinterpreted to provide states with immunity from lawsuits, and the CopyrightAct of 1976, which the courts have found to be not specific enough tooverride the 11th Amendment.andM;Ambiguous Copyright ActandM;&quot;The situation is as follows--a number of federal appeals courts have ruledthat the [copyright law is not specific enough to abrogate state sovereignty,and therefore the state can't be sued for copyright infringement,&quot; said RonPalenski, general counsel for Adapso.andM;Officials from the U.S.andP;  Copyright Office also support the bills before theHouse and the Senate, which they said will clarify the original intent of thecopyright legislation.andM;&quot;We feel that the Copyright Act of 1976 intended all along that states beliable similar to anyone else, but the courts have now found differentlyunder the 11th Amendment prohibition, so the Copyright Law as it currentlystands doesn't adequately make that clear,&quot; said Richard Glasgow, assistantgeneral counsel at the Copyright Office in Washington, D.C.andM;Opposition to the bills is being expressed, however, by some members of theacademic community.andP;  August Steinhilder, head of the Educators Ad HocCommittee on Copyright Law, said he opposes the awarding of statutory damagesand lawyers' fees that is included in the bills, but he believes the awardingof actual damages is &quot;negotiable.&quot;andM;&quot;Attorneys' fees are not applicable in cases involving the federalgovernment-- why shouldn't the sate also be exempt?&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thelegislation isn't necessary.andP;  There have been no proven damages and it's allspeculative.&quot;andM;Officials from the software industry believe the software piracy problem isso widespread that providing redress for statutory damages is essential.andM;&quot;Providing mere actual damages isn't enough of a deterrent,&quot; Adapso' Palenskisaid.andP;  &quot;This stuff is expensive to produce, it's easily ripped off, and it'sripped off in exact replica.andP;  Software is different from textbooks--you loadthe diskette into the computer and make an exact duplicate.andP;  The 100,000thcopy is as accurate as the first.andP;  It's cheap, it's quick, it's flawless.andM;&quot;I can understand that school districts often face tight budgets, but so dosoftware companies in creating new and innovative software.andP;  To allow thatkind of investment in Randamp;D to be misappropriated with impunity I don't believeis justifiable.andP;  The best research we have indicates that one-half of allsoftware in use to date is unlawful.andM;Adapso and SPA are also sponsoring legislation that would allow softwarevendors to restrict the rental or lending of their applications.andP;  Non-profitlibraries could still lend software under the proposed legislation.andP;  None ofthe legislation, once passed, would be retroactive, according to Adapsoofficials.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
