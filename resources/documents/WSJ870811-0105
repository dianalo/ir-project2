The strike, which began Sunday night, has been marked by scattered violent clashes. As of late yesterday, United Press International reported, 16 miners and three mine security officers had been injured, and 18 strikers had been detained by police.    Mine owners reportedly had been building stockpiles for weeks in anticipation of a strike, but an extended, widespread walkout could have a serious impact on South Africa, which depends on its mining industry for about 80% of its foreign-currency earnings. Gold alone provides more than half of such earnings.    Cyril Ramaphosa, NUM's general secretary, told a news conference: &quot;The members are prepared to mount a bitter and protracted struggle for a living wage.&quot;    The work stoppage could spread beyond the gold and coal mines; union officials were instructed to begin strike balloting yesterday at 12 mines that produce platinum, chrome, uranium and diamonds.    On international commodities markets yesterday, prices of gold and other precious metals rose. But traders and analysts said there wouldn't be any shortage of gold on world markets even if supplies were disrupted for a few months. Only if the strike spilled over into the nation's platinum mines would there be a significant market impact, they said.    The union said that at least 340,000 gold and coal miners were on strike, which would represent more than half of the country's 600,000 black miners, and that 44 mines had been closed as a result. The Chamber of Mines, which represents the six major mining houses, said that between 220,000 and 230,000 workers had walked out. It said the action had &quot;significantly affected&quot; 29 of its gold and coal mines, out of a total of 99.    Even at the lowest estimate of the number of workers involved,the strike's size surpasses walkouts in 1984 and 1985 that involved as many as 100,000 miners. There have been several walkouts by black workers larger than the current miners' strike, but they have been one-day or two-day protests generally sparked by political demands and not related to contract negotiations.    The strike was called to press demands for a 30% wage increase, additional home leave and danger pay. But Mr. Ramaphosa said the strike also was a crucial test of strength between the white mine owners and his black union. He said it was up to the Chamber of Mines to make the next move.    Bobby Godsell, a spokesman for Anglo American Corp., South Africa's largest mining house, viewed the wage issue as a pretext for a showdown. &quot;This trial of strength had to come sometime,&quot; he said. &quot;That is what industrial relations is all about. Our first concern is to prevent violence and deaths. Our second concern is to survive and win.&quot;    Meanwhile, Labor Minister Pietie du Plessis said officials are preparing legislation to curb the growing power of the black unions. &quot;It is essential to have a balance between the power wielded by the worker and that of the employer,&quot; he said. &quot;Too much power on either side would lead to revolution.&quot;    It is believed that mines of Anglo American and General Mining Union Corp., or Gencor, where union representation is highest, are the mines most affected by the strike. While Anglo didn't release figures on the number of workers on strike, it said there was &quot;extensive strike action&quot; at its gold mines and &quot;significant participation&quot; in strike action at its collieries. Gencor said more than 30,000 workers were on strike at its gold and coal mines.    The strike was aimed at 46 mines that have recognized NUM as the official representative of black workers, but the union claimed that at least 60,000 miners not directly involved in the contract dispute have walked out in sympathy.    The union called on its members to leave their mine hostels and return home at the start of the strike, in an attempt to avoid violence and to prevent attempts by employers to coerce miners into going back to work. But mine officials, claiming there was little support for the union call, warned that workers who leave the hostels might discover that they have no jobs to return to when the strike is over.    Several incidents of violence were reported. A spokesman for Anglo American said there had been incidents of intimidation by strikers at some mines and that an outbreak of violence Sunday night between strikers and those miners wanting to go to work resulted in six injuries. A company statement said &quot;Mine security was forced to use tear smoke and rubber bullets to disperse intimidators.&quot;    Anglovaal Ltd., which doesn't recognize NUM, said security men fired rubber bullets to disperse an &quot;unruly mob&quot; on Sunday at its Lorraine gold mine, about 150 miles southwest of Johannesburg. It said one miner was treated for a leg wound. NUM spokesman Marcel Golding said union members at the mine were attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets while holding a pre-strike meeting.    Mr. Golding also said police entered worker hostels at two mines and marched the men to work at gunpoint, &quot;on the pretext of protecting people who want to work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
