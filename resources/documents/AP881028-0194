The service, in brief announcements, said it was awarding theengine contract to the Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co., apartnership formed by the Allison Gas Turbine Division of theGeneral Motors Corp. and the Garrett Engine Division of the AlliedSignal Aerospace Co.   That partnership was selected over another competing team, knownas APW, formed by the Pratt andamp; Whitney Division of the UnitedTechnologies Corp. and Lycoming of Textron Inc.   The Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co. previously had received acontract worth $132.4 million and on Friday, it won another $75.4million to continue the work.   As for designing the rest of the chopper and building prototypes,the Army said it was releasing funds to two contractor teams andformally setting them in competition against one another. Each teamreceived $158 million on Friday to pursue the work, the Army said.   The two teams include a joint venture of Boeing Helicopters andUnited Technology's Sikorsky Aircraft, and another partnership thatincludes two units of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. and BellHelicopter Textron Inc.   The Army moves involve a project known as the LHX program and hadbeen expected ever since Congress approved the fiscal 1989 budgetlate last month.   LHX _ or Light Helicopter Experimental _ is an effort to developa new light attack and observation helicopter that can move the Armyinto the 21st century. The new craft would be used in replacingaging fleets of Vietnam-era AH-1 Cobra, OH-6 Cayuse and OH-58 Kiowachoppers.   The Army hopes to purchase 2,096 of the new helicopters at a costof roughly $40 billion. The LHX program was cut in half early thisyear because of budget reductions, but still stands as one of theArmy's most expensive programs ever.   The two engine teams began competing on what the Army calls theT-800 engine in July 1985. Each LHX will require two of the engines,and the Army has long described the T-800's development as a crucialstep in improving existing technology.   ``Today's award extends LHTEC's full-scale developmentcontract,'' the Army said. ``APW's contract will be terminated.''   After developing the new engine, the Army expects the two teampartners, Allison and Garrett, to compete against each other forannual production awards. Ultimately, the engine work is expected tobe worth more than $1.5 billion to the two companies.   Allison is based in Indianapolis, Ind., and Garrett is located inPhoenix, Ariz.   The new engine is a 1,200 shaft horsepower turbine and the firstdeliveries are being scheduled for 1995.   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the contract also wasunusual in that LHTEC had provided a guarantee that the average costof each engine would not exceed $245,000.</TEXT></DOC>
