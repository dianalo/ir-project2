He wassuspended Tuesday.   Kim Keble-White said James Lovell, a 24-year-old actor, couldhave his job back if he cut the offending material from his act.   Lovell, who traveled to and from work in tricorn hat, bells andquartered red and green outfit, was not available for comment afterthe announcement, but said earlier Tuesday he would not alter hisperformance.   In somewhat medieval syntax, Lovell said he realized his boss wasirritated, ``but Lord fool him for being thus inflamed, for I am thefool, and therefore for him to get inflamed by my foolery makes hima fool, for sure.''   ``He is acting with artistic pique,'' declared Keble-White,marketing director of the exhibition, who said the young jester hadbeen ``doing a super job'' before turning his wit on contemporarytargets.   Keble-White said some of Lovell's jokes ``are a little bit tackyand he doesn't know exactly where to draw the line.''   For example: ``What is small, silent and lonely and lives in astable? Captain Phillips.'' That is a jibe at shy, horse-loving MarkPhillips, whose separation from his wife, Princess Anne, wasannounced last week.   A parody on the eccentricities of Prince Charles, heir to thethrone, was another feature of Lovell's act for visitors to theexhibition on British royalty through the ages.   He did a three-minute monologue of Charles talking to asunflower. It was inspired by the prince's revelation some yearsback that he talked to his plants to encourage growth.   Executives of Unicorn Heritage, which owns Royal Britain, sayLovell was an excellent jester until pointing his japery beyondmedieval royalty.   ``I said to James, `We'd love you to carry on, old chap, but itmust be jokes of the period,''' Keble-White said in an interview.   ``I am nervous that some of the jokes could be offensive, and wewant to prevent people from coming here thinking we want to win somecheap laughs.''   Lovell responded: ``I've been making a few little rudies. Theycome out because I'm a spontaneous jester, my liege, I don't writemy riddles down. I suddenly think of something and if I think ofFergie as a big red thing then that's, alas, what she is.''   Fergie is the nickname for the Duchess of York, whose hair is redand whose waistline is avidly watched by the tabloid press.   Lovell worked as a clown and stage actor before taking the roleof Will Somers, court jester to Henry VIII jester, in January.   He acknowledged on London Broadcasting Corp. radio that his dutywas to behave as a medieval clown, but added: ``I am a jester, myliege, and I, a jester, is licensed to say whatever I wish, so ifthey don't like it they can right royally stuff it.''   Keble-White said he had received no complaints from BuckinghamPalace or the 500,000 people who have visited the exhibition inLondon's financial district since it opened in August 1988.   In depicting British history through royalty, the commercialmuseum features the lives of 52 kings and queens.   It has dummies in period dress and enlargements of contemporarynewspaper front pages with stories on royalty. Visitors can vote onwhether the press treats royals fairly, and Keble-White said thetide is running against the press.   Buckingham Palace cooperated in setting up the exhibition, hesaid, ``so it's important we not fall from grace'' through Lovell'santics.</TEXT></DOC>
