Your April 23article &quot;`Tracking' of Minority Pupils Takes Toll&quot; shines thespotlight on the outrageous differences in percentages ofwhite students vs. minority students in high-achievementclasses in schools throughout the country. The articlededuces (I assume a reflection of the Rand Study deduction)that, because there are so many more minority students inlow-achievement groups, tracking should be abolished becauseit is racist policy.   But the tracking is only the barometer, not the cause, ofthe discrepancies among students' ability to learn.</LP><TEXT>   You point with horror to the fact that in many schoolstracking of students begins as early as kindergarten. As aparent involved in an integrated public-school system foreight years, I feel qualified to report that the differencesin a child's ability to learn are every bit as pronounced inkindergarten as they are in high school.   By eliminating tracking or by trying to make tracking thevillain of a painful scenario, what do we accomplish?Education designed to serve the lowest common denominator?   Instead, let us address all of our energies and resourcestoward the soul of the problem. Let us commit ourselves toearly-childhood programs, mentoring programs, programs forteen-age parents and dropouts, and every other creativeapproach available to combat the conditions that are keepingminority children prisoners of their own fates.   Nancy Butler Brown   Denver   ---   I spent 30 years teaching students ages 11 to 15. In myopinion, the main reason for poorly educated students is thepropensity of the educational bureaucracy for mixed-abilityclasses. Forcing students to take a course when they do nothave the prerequisite knowledge is a cruel and insidious wayof perpetuating segregation. Yet it happens daily in the nameof desegregation.   Until the people who control our schools learn to useobjective measures of achievement (not ability) and to groupstudents accordingly, we will continue to have such problemsas low self-esteem and a high dropout rate.
