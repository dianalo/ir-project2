A hospital near the garrison said at least five people werewounded. A wounded soldier reported numerous dead, and city policechief Lt. Col. Jovencio Gongora said several bodies still were inthe compound.   Gongora said he suspended the assault at dark. Bodies could notbe recovered because some dissident Moslems were believed still onthe grounds.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters in Manila the attackbegan after the military learned the regional Constabularycommander, Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, had been shot and killed by arenegade Moslem policemen.   One of the wounded, Staff Sgt. Rosendo Novelenio, told reportersthere were ``many dead'' on the second floor of the headquartersbuilding where Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and his chief of staff,Col. Romeo Abendan, had been held. There was no word on Abendan'sfate.   Batalla and Abendan were captured Thursday after Batalla orderedMoslem policemen to surrender their weapons and face murder chargesin a 1984 incident.   House of Representatives Speaker Ramon Mitra said the militarydecided to storm the garrison after the policemen's leader,patrolman Rizal Alih, rejected Mitra's last offer. Mitra had askedto see Batalla and verify he was alive.   Ramos said the military learned of Batalla's death from thegovernor of largely Moslem Sulu province, Tupay Loong, who spokewith the kidnappers.   Witnesses said tanks and armored personnel carriers smashedthrough the gates ahead of marines. Reporters saw captors resistwith automatic rifles and grenade launchers, and at least onearmored vehicle was disabled by the firing.   Reporters said a portion of the building where the hostages wereheld had been destroyed by tank fire.   Officials said 30 to 40 armed men, some of whom may have beenMoslem soldiers, apparently slipped into the headquarters buildingovernight to join Alih and an estimated 15 followers. The captorsdemanded to be flown to Siasi Island, 120 miles to the southwest.   Mitra said Alih reneged on an overnight deal to end the disputein exchange for a safe passage to Palawan Island, where he wouldsurrender to military police.   Alih was charged in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor CesarClimaco but was acquitted. Three weeks after Climaco's death, sevenpeople were killed in a marine raid on Alih's home.   Alih faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, Batallareceived permission to arrest Alih. He and eight others were ordereddetained by Batalla and all of them could be charged with murder orconspiracy to commit murder.   Military officials claim Alih has been operating several illegalbusinesses in the Zamboanga area, 560 miles south of Manila.   About 5 million Moslems live in the Philippines, which haspopulation of 59 million. About half Zamboanga's residents areChristian and half Moslem.   Batalla, 50, was promoted to brigadier general last month. Hegraduated from the Philippine Military Academy in 1961, finishingsixth in a class of 54.</TEXT></DOC>
