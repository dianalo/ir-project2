Separately, Wall Street speculation grew that media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London-based WPP. A Murdoch aide said that Mr. Murdoch has been &quot;looking for a long time&quot; at the company. But a WPP spokesman said that &quot;there has been no contact and there has been no acquisition of WPP shares by Murdoch.&quot;    WPP Group is a marketing services company that last year bought ad agency J. Walter Thompson Co.    Russell Anspach, a principal in Anspach Grossman, confirmed the firm's disussions with WPP, but added that Anspach Grossman has been speaking to other potential buyers as well. &quot;We've spoken with five firms over the last couple of months and we're entertaining possibilities,&quot; he said. &quot;The (WPP) discussions are active and current.&quot;    Mr. Anspach declined to discuss terms of an acquisition, but said that the firm's annual revenue is between $5 million and $10 million. WPP declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
