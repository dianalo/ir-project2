Their religious rootsand desire to fit in alongside their often fundamentalist Christianneighbors have produced a cultural blending that sets them apartfrom the American Jewish establishment.   ``I am not certain what it means to be both a Jew and aSoutherner,'' Eli Evans wrote in his personal account of growing upin Durham, N.C. ``To have inherited the Jewish longing for ahomeland while being raised with the Southerner's sense of home.''   The Sunbelt is home for more Jews now. The Jewish population inthe South has grown to about 1.1 million in Alabama, Arkansas,Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to a 1987estimate made for the American Jewish Committee. Florida has abouthalf of the South's Jewish population, mostly in the southern partof the state.   The committee counts about 5.9 million Jews throughout theUnited States.   Jews historically were scattered in rural communities across theregion, and their presence remains strongest in medium-sized citiesand small towns through active congregations like B'nai Shalom intiny Blountville, Tenn.   ``I have to come in for a cultural injection now and thenbecause I miss it,'' said Sharon Moskowitz, 36, a New York nativewho with her husband and two children travels from Marion, Va., toBlountville most Friday nights to attend services at B'nai Shalom.   They are the only Jews in Marion, a town of about 7,000 insouthwestern Virginia near the northeastern Tennessee border.   ``I used to be super, super anxious about it,'' Ms. Moskowitzsaid of rearing her 6-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter in anon-Jewish town. ``My son goes to camp in Long Island and he wasthe only one who knew the Hebrew songs at the camp. In the North,they live it so they don't have to learn it. We can't take it forgranted.''   Judy Peiser, who still lives in her hometown of Memphis, Tenn.,and heads the Center for Southern Folklore there, said, ``I'malways explaining the Jewish culture. It's a constant learningprocess for them (non-Jewish Southerners) and a teaching processfor Jews. You've got to know the answers.''   Jews first ventured to the South from the Northeast or took moredirect routes to flee unfriendly European and Spanish homelands viaocean ports in Galveston, Texas, Charleston, S.C., and otherSouthern cities.   The first arrivals were refugees of the fading SpanishInquisition who dived early into the American melting pot andenthusiastically adopted the aristocratic Southern culture.   The Spanish-speaking Jews were followed in the early- tomid-1800s by Jews from Germany who set out on foot as peddlers,saved enough money to buy horses, then wagons and later openedshops. They were followed by a huge wave of East Europeanimmigrants who were more outwardly religious and who disdained theassimilationist tendencies of the earlier arrivals.   Jews often took prominent places in their new Southernhometowns, and the region today lacks a distinct blue-collar Jewishclass.   ``Jews had to walk a very tight line,'' said Abraham Peck,administrative director of the American Jewish Archives at HebrewUnion College in Cincinnati. ``It's really an amazing thing thatthey were able to live in two worlds, one a world of (their own)religious liberalism and the other a closed-off, segregatedsociety.''   American Judaism's most liberal faction, Reform Judaism, wasborn in the South, where Jews were more economically dependent ontheir non-Jewish neighbors _ black and white.   Carolyn Lipson-Walker, whose doctoral dissertation is titled``Shalom Y'all: The Folklore and Culture of Southern Jews,'' saidSouthern Jews have fused their social and religious practices toproduce a dual culture.   Among the examples her research turned up:   _ A cookbook put together by the women of a synagogue in BatonRouge, La., includes a recipe for matzoh ball gumbo.   _ A synagogue in Brookhaven, Miss., for years held a high holyday shrimp fry, even though traditional Jewish dietary laws banshellfish.   _ A Jewish family in Texas often barbecued matzoh on theirbackyard grill.   _ A Nashville, Tenn., octogenarian recalled a temple celebrationmarked by the arrival of ``Hanukkah Claus on reindeer.''   A Jewish man from Savannah, Ga., explained he never thought ofmarrying outside of his faith. Asked what he meant, Ms.Lipson-Walker said he replied, ``Well, Southern Jews, of course.''   Ethnic differences were discouraged in the South _ she remembersbeing chided as a child in Tuscaloosa, Ala., for using Yiddishwords _ but the practice of religion was encouraged, Ms.Lipson-Walker said.   Jews in the South, both natives and transplants, are affiliatedwith synagogues and other Jewish organizations more than Jewsliving elsewhere, and Jews in the South often travel hundreds ofmiles to seek Jewish contact for themselves and their children, herresearch concluded.   ``Until recently, even the Conservative and Orthodox Jews in theSouth were less traditional than their Northern Jewishcounterparts,'' Ms. Lipson-Walker wrote. ```What will the goyim(non-Jews) think?' takes on a great significance in the relativelyhomogeneous South.''   The South has its notorious examples of violent anti-Semitism,including the Ku Klux Klan and the Atlanta lynching of Leo Frankfor the murder of a 14-year-old pencil factory worker in 1913. ButGail Gans, a researcher in New York for the Anti-Defamation Leagueof B'nai B'rith, said the region no longer stands out as a bastionof discrimination and hatred against Jews.   ``It has historically, of course,'' she said.   Evans, Peck and other researchers agreed the post-Civil Warperiod was among the worst for anti-Semitism in the South.   A notable example was the scapegoating of Judah P. Benjamin, aNew Orleans lawyer who served as attorney general, secretary of warand secretary of state under Jefferson Davis. Many blamed him forthe Confederacy's defeat, while others falsely accused him ofinvolvement in Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Evans said.Benjamin fled in disguise to England.   ``During the 1870s and through the beginning of the 20thcentury, anti-Semitism in the South, in all its manifestations ...were the actions of powerless men reaching out to compensate fortheir economic distress,'' Peck wrote in a paper on Southern Jewry.   Blacks served as a lightning rod, absorbing expressions of biasthat might otherwise have been directed at Jews in the South, whereanti-Semitism was aimed more ``against a generalized stereotype ofthe Jew,'' said Joseph Cohen, a Tennessean who founded the JewishStudies Program at Tulane University.   ``The blacks and the Catholics had the worst time of it and theywere always a buffer,'' he said.   As for Southern Jews, their years of being neighbors and localmerchants seemed to help defuse potential trouble. Said Cohen:``There was a big difference between the stereotypical Jew and Samwho ran the store.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, June 7</NOTE></DOC>
