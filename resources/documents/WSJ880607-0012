A unit of Schering-Plough Corp., of Madison, N.J., will market the licensed alpha-interferon treatment under the brand name Intron-A. The drug isn't recommended for use by pregnant women.    Genital (or venereal) warts are a sexually transmitted viral infection for which current treatments, such as surgery, have proven painful, difficult to administer, or only marginally effective, the FDA said. Repeated clinical trials showed that direct injections of alpha-interferon into the lesions eliminated or significantly reduced the warts in most cases.    The agency said about 8 million new or recurrent cases appear each year in the U.S. The warts are highly contagious and can be disfiguring. Some studies suggest that, in women, there is a relationship between the warts and development of cervical cancer.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Schering-Plough shares closed at $52.875, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
