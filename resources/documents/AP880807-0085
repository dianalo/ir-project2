MCI, long considered a brassy and freewheeling risk-taker, hashoned its management style and developed a strategy that has madeit a $5 billion company and the major long-distance competitor ofindustry leader American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   ``They are a full-service firm that can compete on all frontswith ATandamp;T,'' said Jack Grubman, a telephone analyst withPaineWebber Inc. ``The growing up and pains associated with thatare for the most part behind them and they're looking at a long runof pretty healthy growth ahead.''   MCI surprised analysts last month when it reported a ninefoldincrease in second-quarter profits, confirming the self-confidenceit displayed a week before when it announced it would buy back the16.2 percent stake held by International Business Machines Corp.   In the quarter that ended June 30, MCI reported record netincome of $73 million on record revenues of $1.2 billion,strengthened by increased sales of 800 and international servicesand the continued signing up of large corporate accounts.   MCI Chairman William G. McGowan, who on Aug. 8, 1968, foundedthe company that became MCI, also sees good things ahead for hiscompany, but only with continued hard work and long hours _ noteven time out for a birthday celebration.   ``I think the challenge is always in front of us,'' McGowan saidin an interview last week as the company quietly closed out its20th year in business. Rates for MCI's various services are from 5percent to 15 percent below those of ATandamp;T, McGowan says.   ``It's a tough competitive industry and we've got to stay toughand fresh and look at it as a challenge every day,'' he said.   ``The meek ... may inherit the Earth, but they won't increasemarket share,'' McGowan said.   That attitude is what has driven MCI, whose pioneer effort tocompete in the long-distance industry influenced the government'sdecision to break up the ATandamp;T telephone monopoly.   MCI first took on ATandamp;T in 1969 when it received governmentapproval to establish a microwave link between Chicago and St.Louis to serve companies that had offices in both cities. Itattracted customers to its tiny network with promises of savingsover ATandamp;T, and over the next decade the network grew as McGowanpersistently attacked the telephone monopoly in the courts andbefore government regulators.   In 1980, MCI began offering residential long-distance service,but not until after the ATandamp;T divestiture in January 1984 was thecompany able to offer customers the same easy 1-plus dialing thatATandamp;T could offer. The consent decree stripped ATandamp;T of its localoperating companies and required them to begin offeringlong-distance companies the same connection to the local networksas ATandamp;T had long enjoyed.   Though MCI is growing stronger, the company continues to lobbystrongly before the courts, the Federal Communications Commissionand the Congress for protection from ATandamp;T.   Competition in the $50 billion-a-year long-distance industrywill thrive as long as ATandamp;T is not free to use its size to undercutthe opposition and drive competitors out of business, MCI argues.   But ATandamp;T says MCI wants it both ways: it wants to appear toshareholders as a strong, confident, state-of-the art network butit wants to appear to regulators as a struggling, vulnerableupstart.   ``They're trying to carry water on both shoulders,'' saidLawrence Garfinkel, ATandamp;T vice president for marketing. ``A $5billion company, larger than many other firms, isn't going to beput out of business.''   ATandamp;T has been trying to persuade regulators, the courts andCongress to loosen the regulatory reins on the company to allow itto compete more freely and with more flexibility in a thrivingindustry. Only ATandamp;T is subject to regulations.   ``It's no longer a David-and-Goliath syndrome,'' Garfinkel said.``They are a full-fledged competitor in the marketplace and thewhole thrust of the market now is alternative competitors.''   ATandamp;T had 72 percent of the market last year, followed by MCIwith 9.3 percent and US Sprint Communications Co. with 5.6 percent,according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.   In contrast to MCI's financial success, US Sprint has lost $1.76billion since it was formed in July 1986 as a joint venture of GTECorp. and United Telecommunications Inc.   Analysts have watched closely as MCI has staged a steadycomeback from a tumultuous 1986 when profits were disappearingbehind price cuts it had to make to keep rates below ATandamp;T's. MCIcut staff by 15 percent and took a $550 million writeoff of networkassets, ending 1986 with a $448 million loss.   In the winter of 1987, with McGowan sidelined by a heart attack,company executives conducted a soul-searching that developed acorporate strategy designed to lift MCI out of the doldrums andrefocus the company as a full-service company, not just a nicheplayer.   McGowan, who underwent heart transplant surgery that spring,returned to his desk and by the third quarter of that year the planwas producing results. Costs were down and the company was makinginroads into corporate accounts and boosting its share of thelong-distance market.   McGowan said the prescription for corporate success is ayouthful spirit that can accommodate change, especially in anindustry that has been turned inside out by regulatory changes andtechnological advances.   ``We have to make sure that we institutionalize change,''McGowan said. ``The normal tendency is to institutionalize thestatus quo. We should challenge the status quo and I would worry ifwe don't.''</TEXT></DOC>
