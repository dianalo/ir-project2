(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Deere andamp; Co. and the United Auto Workersreached a tentative three-year contract agreement over the weekend,opening the way for a resumption of talks between the union andCaterpillar Inc.   The tentative settlement between Deere and the UAW was announcedby Deere spokesman Robert Combs at 5:08 a.m. CDT Saturday after 20hours of bargaining.   A threatened widespread strike against Deere was averted withannouncement of the agreement.   Combs said the agreement would take effect immediately uponratification by the company's 13,400 UAW employees at factories andwarehouses in Illinois, Iowa, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Denver. Nodate was set for a vote.   Karl Mantyla, a UAW spokesman, said the agreement was tentativeand ``subject to getting language from the company and resolutionof local issues.''   He refused to give details on the proposed contract.   The spotlight now shifts back to the St. Louis suburb ofBridgeton, Mo., where negotiators for Caterpillar and the UAWagreed Friday to extend their contract indefinitely and recesstalks pending the outcome of Deere bargaining.   Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin said the talks were notexpected resume until after the Deere pact was ratified.   Deere was chosen as the target for a settlement or strikebecause union officials believed they had a better opportunity forcontract gains there.   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator in the Caterpillartalks, said the union likely would use the Deere contract as apattern for talks with Caterpillar.   Caterpillar, the largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipmentwith 58,800 employees worldwide, will face renewed union demandsfor 100 percent job security, a reduction in overtime, call-back of1,000 UAW members on layoff and the first merit pay increase in adecade.   The union reportedly is seeking a three-year pact and a threepercent wage increase in each yeart.   Caterpillar wants to hold down costs and is seeking moreflexibility in job assignments and scheduling, and wants torestrict employee mobility and save money on retraining.   If talks break down, either side can terminate the contract withfive days' notice and Caterpillar could face a strike by 17,500blue-collar workers at plants in 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa, York,Penn., Denver, and Memphis.   In a highly unusual move in Deere negotiations, representativesof both sides talked past a midnight Friday strike deadline with noformal extension of the current contract or call for a walkout.   Mantyla said the union did not call for a strike, but scatteredpickets were reported at Deere plants in East Moline, Ill., andDubuque, Iowa.   The tentative settlement averted a full-scale walkout like thebitter strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days with employees'acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions.</TEXT></DOC>
