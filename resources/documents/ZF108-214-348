 The desktop presentation market is almostexclusively microcomputer oriented, with Apple and IBM leading theway.andP;  Workstations have been left behind because they areprimarily used for scientific and technical chores, andapplications developers do not perceive a large enough market tofield presentation software.andP;  Presentation packages are becomingmore popular because many of the necessary peripheral devices suchas slide makers and scanners, as well as the applicationsthemselves, are coming down in price.andP;  This coupled with computerswith more memory and faster processors has helped presentationproducts move into the mainstream.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Multimedia TechnologyMarket AnalysisPresentation HardwarePresentation SoftwareMicrocomputersDesktop Publishing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Desktop presentation market to double by 1993andM;The market for desktop presentation hardware, software and supplies will growfrom $4.4 billion in 1989 to more than $8.9 billion by 1993, according to areport released by Desktop Presentations, a market research company inMountain View, Calif.andM;&quot;People are starting to discover that personal computers give them advantagesin terms of quality, speed, control and the cost of production,&quot; said WilliamCoggshall, president of Desktop Presentations.andM;Coggshall said that the desktop presentation market comprises almostexclusively IBM and Apple Computer PCs.andM;&quot;Workstations haven't played a role at all yeat.andP;  It's amazing to me thatpeople who use workstations and have to create presentations will often havea workstation and a Macintosh or PC side by side,&quot; he said.andM;Other analysts cited the lack of desktop presentation applications forworkstations, which they said resulted from a lack of demand.andM;&quot;It's strictly a desktop product--workstations are used more for scientificand engineering applications.andP;  The demands for presentation applications aremuch smaller [for technical users] than in the business sector,&quot; said BillClinton, director of corporate publishing systems at Bis Cap International, amarket research company in Norwell, Mass.andM;&quot;If there's a technical user who wants to do a presentation on a workstation,he or she will use a text editor or a layout product, since the applicationsare just not available for workstations.andP;  It's not a significant enoughmarket for applications developers to make an effort,&quot; he said.andM;There are a number of factors fueling the growth of the desktop presentationmarket.andP;  These include increased ease of use and the availability oftechnologies that are now becoming affordable to larger numbers of users.andM;&quot;Traditionally, there's been a fairly high entry point for this market forproducts such as slide makers [and] scanners and for the application aswell,&quot; said John Dunkle, vice president of Workgroup Technologies, a marketresearch company based in Hampton, N.H.andM;&quot;These are getting less expensive, as is memory, and faster processors arenow widely available, which also has allowed presentation products to moveinto the mainstream,&quot; Dunkle said.andM;Multimedia on the desktopandM;Technology that allows multimedia presentations will also propel themarketplace.andM;&quot;One thing that we're going to see in the desktop presentation environment istrue multimedia, [which is] only in its infancy now,&quot; said Michael Goulde, adirector at Bis Cap International.andM;As is the case in other areas of the computer industry, software formultimedia and general desktop presentation that takes advantage of hardwarecapabilities is lagging behind the available hardware.andM;&quot;All of the boxes to integrate the media are out there, [and] the softwareinterface to control and to integrate the elements of presentations is onlygoing to get better,&quot; said Tom Nichols, president of Microvisual Systems, acolor-imaging systems integrator and multimedia development company inNewton, Mass.andM;&quot;People are starting to learn the technology and come up to speed, and pricesare reaching the points where people can go from mere overheads and slides tonifty-stuff video and audio and interactive presentations,&quot; Bis CapInternational's Goulde said.andM;Although the multimedia desktop presentation software that currently existsis powerful, it's hard to use.andP;  This will change as the market grows, and theapplications will also become more accessible, Nichols said.andM;&quot;I'm an early adopter, and I'm willing to work through difficult software.andO;But the software will get easier, and as it does, it will open more doors tomore people.andP;  And the costs will go down as more users enter the market,&quot;Nichols said.andM;&quot;Graphical user interfaces are widespread now with Windows and OS/2, and easeof use is playing a role,&quot; added Bis Cap International's Clinton.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
