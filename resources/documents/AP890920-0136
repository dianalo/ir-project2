The proposals are in a package of conventionial arms control cutsthat the Western alliance intends to present Thursday to the WarsawPact, the sources said on condition of anonymity.   They would oblige both sides to give advance notice of a majormobilization of reservists and of large troop movements andconcentrations, said the sources.   Other proposals they outlined would mandate easy access tospecific weapons depots holding up to a fifth of each side'sarsenals, and simplify surveillance of equipment in units with a lowlevel of readiness.   The package is little changed from one that was to be offered twoweeks ago at the opening fall session of East-West non-nucleartalks, which was delayed by squabbling among NATO members.   New is the suggestion both sides limit war games to a ceiling ofseveral tens of thousands of troops or several hundred battle tanks,the diplomatic sources said. They refused to be more specific aboutthe figures.   At the Sept. 14 session, both sides expressed hopes for speedyprogress toward a treaty reducing conventional forces of bothmilitary alliances from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural mountains.   Soviet chief delegate Oleg A. Grinevsky pledged to get down tohard work at the six-week session on Conventional Armed Forces inEurope. Stephen J. Ledogar, his U.S. counterpart, welcomed WarsawPact agreement to try and reach a draft treaty within a year.   President Bush challenged the East bloc to accept that time framein May when he proposed limiting foreign-based U.S. and Soviettroops to 275,000 each. Bush's package also envisioned slashingnumbers of military aircraft and other weapons.   NATO proposals drawn from Bush's speech were presented to theWarsaw Pact at the end of a second round of talks July 13, but theSoviets and their allies have yet to respond.   Stances seem furthest apart on air forces, with NATO proposingeach alliance have no more than 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900helicopter gunships. The July 13 initiative also would restrict anyone country to 3,420 combat aircraft and 1,140 combat helicopters.   While not presenting specific figures, the Warsaw Pact insistscombat interceptors based near Moscow and the Urals be excluded _ astand NATO rejects.   Other thresholds proposed by the West would limit each allianceto 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 28,000 armoredpersonnel carriers.   The Warsaw Pact has been more vague, suggesting overallreductions of 10 percent to 15 percent in aircraft and five otherweapons categories by 1994. That would be followed by a further 25percent cut by 1997, with the ultimate goal of purely defensiveforces by the year 2000.   While the Warsaw Pact has dropped decades of objections to NATOclaims that it is outmanned and outgunned, wide differences continueto exist on numbers.   The new NATO proposals were not presented during the opening fallsession after Greece voiced a last-minute objection to provisionsmandating that only maneuvers with 40,000 or more reservists and1,200 or more armed carriers be announced in advance.   Athens, wary of NATO partner Turkey's greater military strength,wanted a lower limit. Without elaborating, the sources said thedispute has been papered over.   Because of other internal disagreements, the NATO proposalsremain purposely vague on how to exchange information on forcemakeup and verification of compliance with an eventual arms treaty,said the sources.   Western negotiators at the 23-nation talks have said the UnitedStates and Canada are seeking strict surveillance, while theirEuropean partners object to frequent inspections of their facilitiesby the Warsaw Pact.</TEXT></DOC>
