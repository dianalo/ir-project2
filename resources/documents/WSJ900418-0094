The law requires Massachusetts companies to have staggeredterms for directors, with one-third elected every year,effectively blocking BTR's attempt to win majority control ofNorton's board at Norton's April 26 annual meeting.</LP><TEXT>   Passage of the bill, expected to be signed by Gov. MichaelDukakis this morning, is another sign of states becoming moreactive to protect local companies from hostile takeovers.Pennsylvania is expected soon to adopt the nation's moststringent anti-takeover bill, which would garnish the profitsof short-term shareholders who sell after a failed attempt to&quot;control&quot; a company and restrict voting rights of largeholders in proxy fights, among other things.   &quot;I think it's likely that you'll see other statesfollowing the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania examples,&quot;predicted Robert A. Kindler, a partner and merger-lawspecialist with Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, New York.   The new Massachusetts law, introduced in response to thebid for Norton, an abrasives maker based in Worcester, Mass.,may not help Norton as much as its supporters hope, however.Many takeover-stock traders said that even if BTR can onlyget one-third of its nominees elected, that minority couldprobably force the rest of Norton's board to negotiate withBTR, a British conglomerate.   Indeed, although Norton dropped 50 cents a share incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stockstill closed at $76, above BTR's $75-a-share offer,indicating that traders think Norton remains vulnerable.   The new law &quot;doesn't keep Norton independent; it justgives them a card to play,&quot; said one trader. Mr. Kindleradded, &quot;The usual wisdom is that if you are able to take overeven a third of the board of a target company, that putsextraordinary pressure on the board. The Massachusetts-typestatute should not ultimately dissuade a hostile bidder.&quot;   BTR's chances of winning board seats are considered goodbecause it has been tendered more than 60% of Norton's stockin its $1.64 billion bid, currently scheduled to expire April27. Moreover, if BTR completes its tender offer and buys theNorton shares, it could replace another one-third of Norton'sboard at next year's annual meeting, and thus win control ofthe board.   A Wall Street source said Norton told legislators itneeded action on the staggered-board bill by this week at thelatest. The urgency was prompted by a federal court rulinglast week that Norton couldn't cancel its scheduled annualmeeting and instead hold a special shareholders meeting onJune 26. Norton, which has appealed that ruling, said itneeded additional time to consider alternatives, such as thesale of a minority stake to a friendly investor.   The new Massachusetts law mandates staggered boards unlessthe board of directors opts out and chooses to have a fixedboard with all members being elected annually. In addition,an amendment was added permitting a change to a fixed boardby a two-thirds vote of shareholders -- although this clausewill take effect only after Jan. 1, 1992.   The provision was added because the legislature &quot;hadconcerns about completely taking power from shareholders,&quot;said Laura McCarthy, a legislative aide. Asked why the Jan.1, 1992, date was selected, she conceded that it was in partto prevent BTR and its supporters from using their shares tocall a special meeting and then vote to abolish Norton'sstaggered-term board.   Other states are likely to follow suit in adoptingprotective laws, several takeover law specialists said, eventhough there has been a reaction against the Pennsylvaniabill from institutional investors, some corporations and eventhe chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ThePennsylvania bill is intended to protect Armstrong WorldIndustries Inc., which is the object of a proxy contest and apossible takeover bid from the Belzberg family of Canada.   Ralph Whitworth, director of United ShareholdersAssociation, a national shareholder-rights group, criticizedthe Massachusetts law as &quot;an unprecedented assault on themost fundamental right of shareholders. . . . TheMassachusetts legislature did the bidding of a few CEO's withpowerful conflicts of interest.&quot;   But Mr. Kindler, the Cravath Swaine attorney, said hebelieves the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania proposals areallowed under the U.S. Constitution. &quot;It is likely that theMassachusetts and Pennsylvania statutes are constitutional,since states can properly regulate the internal affairs ofcorporations, including the election and terms fordirectors,&quot; Mr. Kindler said. &quot;In theory, a state could passa statute giving directors life tenure,&quot; Mr. Kindler said.   Still, some takeover lawyers believe there eventually willbe a backlash against anti-takeover laws. Meredith Brown, apartner and merger specialist with Debevoise andamp; Plimpton, NewYork, said, &quot;If the states carried the trend too far, thereis going to be some attempt to revive the idea of a federalpre-emption in that area. But there is a fair amount ofrunning room because there's not much congressional supportfor federal regulation of corporate affairs.&quot;   ---   Randall Smith contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
