Roll Call, theCapitol Hill newspaper, has discovered a last-minutecommittee addition that would exempt Members from serving onjuries in their home districts. Members are now routinelyexcused from jury duty on account of their business inWashington, but that's not enough for Democratic Rep. VicFazio, the chief defender of Congressional perks. He saysseveral Members asked him to draft the law, because, &quot;it's ahassle in the sense that you have to go through that work&quot; ofgetting excused from service. GOP Rep. Jerry Lewis promises afight on the House floor next month, and even Democratic Rep.Jack Brooks, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, says thelaw &quot;hardly seems necessary.&quot; Rep. Fazio and his friendsapparently feel so invulnerable to defeat that they arewilling to try to enact laws disconnecting them from thedreary responsibilities of their own districts.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
