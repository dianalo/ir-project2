The kidnappers, identified as two married couples who earlierobtained a $42,000 ransom in exchange for freeing a 9-year-old boythey abducted, set a 3 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) deadline to swap theircaptives for food, a pilot and a getaway helicopter to fly them toParaguay.   ``The trade will be made at that time without any tricks,''police Officer Nivaldo de Pirondi said in a telephone interviewfrom Presidente Prudente, near the site of the standoff and 525miles west of Rio.   ``We don't want to do anything to provoke the kidnappers and putthe hostages' lives at risk,'' de Pirondi said. ``We are dealingwith professionals, but they are charged up and could do somethingirrational at any moment.''   He said the hostages _ two TV reporters and the driver of thearmored car _ were in fair physical condition. They were being heldin the armored car, which about 100 heavily armed police havesurrounded since early Friday with sharpshooters aiming at thecar's small windows.   The standoff began after a three-day chase through south-centralBrazil, police said.   Authorities were delayed in meeting the kidnappers' demandsbecause the first aircraft developed mechanical trouble and wasgrounded in a nearby field, de Pirondi said.   He said a second helicopter was summoned from Brasilia, thecapital, and was due to arrive early this afternoon.   The drama began Aug. 3, when the two couples abducted 9-year-oldSaid Agel Filho from his home in the central Brazilian city ofGoiania, 565 miles northwest of Sao Paulo. The kidnapping was keptsecret at first to protect the child, police said.   Six days later, police found where the boy was being held, butthe kidnappers negotiated a ransom of about $42,000 and an armoredcar for their getaway. They then took the two TV reporters andheaded for the Goiania Airport.   However, Goias state authorities failed to provide an airplaneand pilot for their escape, and the kidnappers set off on aninterstate flight through the states of Goias, Minas Gerais and SaoPaulo.</TEXT></DOC>
