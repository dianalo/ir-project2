We have neighbors who operate six or seven automobiles andcontinuously park two of them directly in front of our house. There are timesI would like to use this space either for myself or when we have company. Ipay the same taxes as these people. This doesn't seem fair.;    -- J.M., SantaClara  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NOT EASY TO CURB ANNOYANCE ON STREET  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  Sorry. The streets are public property, according our contacts with thepolice department. You can't &quot;reserve&quot; a space in front of your home forpersonal use only. There is a provision of the California Vehicle Code thatallows a property owner to have the space in front of his or her propertypainted blue to designate it as a handicapped parking zone. But then you'dneed a handicapped parking placard to legally park there. Our police contactsays if neighbors aren't using the streets to store their vehicles, there'snothing that can be done. If they are storing the vehicles on the street, thenyou'll need to contact the police department. Our contacts suggest a friendlychat with your neighbor about the problem.; WRITING TIP O'NEILL; Q  I saw TipO'Neill, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, the other day ontelevision addressing a U.S. Senate subcommittee. The committee was reviewingthe National Cancer Act. O'Neill was recounting his recent experiences withcancer and he asked the subcommittee to begin to heighten public awareness tothe fact that less funding is appropriated to the act now than wasappropriated in 1980. I've been trying to find an address where I could writethe former speaker for more than a year now. Can you help?;    -- VictoriaMalcolm, San Jose; A  Send your letter to the Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill,Jr., at the offices of O'Neill and Athy, 1310 19th St., N.W., Washington, D.C.20036.; ALMOST A CITIZEN; Q  Please help me become a U.S. citizen. I took theoral examination Nov. 9, 1989, and passed all required tests. I was told atthat time I would be informed of my swearing-in date within 90 days. I finallyheard from the Immigration and Naturalization Service on June 18, 1990. I wastold that the fingerprints the service had on file for me had expired and Ihad to submit new prints, which I did. I went to the San Jose INS office lastOctober and was told it was still waiting for my visa from the records officein San Francisco. Apparently, because I immigrated to the United States fromMexico in 1955, INS is having trouble recovering my records. An agent said theonly thing I could do was wait or ask a legislator for help. Can you helpspeed up this process?;    -- Jose Haro, Santa Clara; A  Congratulations.You've been scheduled for a final hearing at 7:45 a.m. May 15.
