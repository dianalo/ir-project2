In a pair of unanimous rulings, the court concluded that DNAtests which linked Timothy Wilson Spencer to the rape-slayings oftwo women were scientifically reliable.   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic genetic material inhuman cells. Scientists believe that everyone, except for identicaltwins, has a unique DNA pattern.   Spencer, 26, a former resident of a Richmond halfway house, wasconvicted of murder and sentenced to death in separate trials lastyear for the slayings of Susan M. Tucker, 44, of Arlington andDebbie Dudley Davis, 35, of Richmond.   The women were bound and strangled by an assailant who broke intotheir homes through a window. At both trials, evidence was offeredthat semen samples from the crime scenes and blood samples fromSpencer had matching DNA patterns.   In DNA analysis, microscopic fragments of thread-like geneticmaterial are treated so that they arrange themselves intocharacteristic patterns which look much like the bar codes used bysupermarket scanners.   If pattern samples from crime scene match the suspect's, theblood or semen is considered to have come from the suspect, sincethe likelihood of matching patterns from different people isreckoned at 1 in many millions.   The state Supreme Court said Spencer's challenge to the DNAevidence amounted to saying ``that we should hold off until anotherday'' any decision on the reliability of such tests.   But a number of expert witnesses testified that the technique isgenerally accepted in the scientific community.   ``Indeed, Spencer acknowledges that the evidence establishes thatthe DNA tests are accepted `as reliable within the scientificcommunity' and that he `was unable to find or produce one qualifiedexpert to debunk either the theory of DNA printing or the statisticsgenerated therefrom,''' the court said.   Earlier this year, Spencer was convicted and sentenced to deathin two other cases, the rapes and murders of Dr. Susan ElizabethHellams, 32, of Richmond, and Diane Cho, 15, of Chesterfield County.   Both those cases are still on appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
