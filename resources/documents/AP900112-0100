U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo set the $1 million bail for DanielMiranda, who is charged with flying from Fort Lauderdale to Panamawith $800,000 in laundered drug money. But prosecutors appealed thebail, meaning that Miranda, 36, could not immediately be released.   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane was late to court because hewas attacked near his home by a masked man with a foot-longcrowbar. Police arrested a suspect, but would give no details.   ``I can't think of anybody who would do this,'' O'Kane said.``Maybe it has to do with the case, maybe not.''   O'Kane said his attacker offered to tell who sent him only ifassault charges were dropped, but the attorney said he did not planto drop the charges.   O'Kane's head was bandaged but still bleeding when he arrived incourt. His report of the attack prompted federal marshals toincrease security for Palmermo.   Attorneys met privately with U.S. District Judge WilliamHoeveler for what The Miami Herald reported would be discussions ofefforts to move Noriega to more secure quarters until his trial ondrug trafficking charges.   Participants said they were under strict orders not to discussany transfer plans publicly. Speculation has centered on federalprisons in Atlanta and Marion, Ill. as possible destinations.   A Justice Department security team sent from Washington toprotect classified information in the Noriega trial has tolddefense attorneys they may have to pass security clearances beforegaining access to the documents they need.   The Justice Department is not only deciding which documents areaccessible, but through the U.S. attorney's office is playing therole of prosecutor of Noriega, who assisted the CIA from the 1970suntil 1985.   ``It is pretty odd that they're both from the Department ofJustice and yet these people (court security) claim that they'reneutral,'' said Steven Kreisberg, who represents Noriegaco-defendant William Saldarriaga of Colombia, an alleged cocainetrafficker. ``When they all work in the same department, I questionthat.''   As a sign of the extra security surrounding the case, documentsare being sealed on arrival at federal court for transfer toHoeveler.   O'Kane charged U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen was misapplyingsecurity guidelines and contended he was threatened by governmentofficials in the name of security.   O'Kane, as part of a defense motion this week, asked thegovernment to examine intelligence information collected at a U.S.military telecommunications listening post dubbed ``The Tunnel'' inPanama City.   He attached a map copied from the Panama City telephone book tospecify its location, and was contacted by a member of the securityteam and then by a prosecutor in Lehtinen's office ``who tells methey are very upset in Washington with what I've been filing and ifI don't get on board it will be bad for my client and bad for mepersonally.''   Reacting to O'Kane's comments, Lehtinen spokeswoman Diane Cossinsaid, ``Defense counsel should abide by ethical standards and nottry this case in the news media or comment on any discussions withthe U.S. attorney's office.''   O'Kane met on security issues Thursday with Hoeveler and Justiceofficials, and the judge laughed when O'Kane explained the sourceof the map.   Another security provision ``is that no classified informationbe discussed even over the telephone because of the danger ofinterception of these transmissions, by the Russians or whoever,''said Kreisberg.   Meanwhile, the arrival of Noriega in Miami on Jan. 4 to face thedrug indictment has fueled speculation that co-defendants maypursue plea bargains to avoid sitting through a bombardment ofallegations aimed largely at Noriega.   The indictment issued in February 1988 accuses Noriega ofprotecting cocaine shipments heading north and coca processingchemicals and drug money headed south.   Samuel Burstyn, who represents former Noriega intelligence chiefLuis del Cid, said, ``The thought of going to trial in a jointtrial with Mr. Noriega with the prospects of that being a realdog-and-pony show are not very appealing to us, so to a certainextent we are motivated to forgo a lengthy and difficult trial.''   Both Burstyn and Kreisberg are seeking separate trials for theirclients.</TEXT></DOC>
