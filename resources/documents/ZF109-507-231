Congress.

Hunter, Ph.D., is a 10-year veteran of the Office of Managementand Budget, where he was director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.andP;  Heis founder of W N Hunter andamp; Associates, a Vienna, Va., management consultingfirm specializing in federal procurement policy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
