Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AHP FORGN </CO><IN> FOD MKT </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advocacy group threatened to renew a boycott against Nestle S.A., charging that the company broke promises it made when an earlier boycott against its products ended four years ago.    The group, Action for Corporate Accountability, said Nestle hasn't followed world-wide guidelines concerning distribution of infant formula supplies, as it agreed to when the seven-year boycott stopped in 1984. Nestle, based in Switzerland, denied the allegation.    In a statement, officials of the Minneapolis-based group said they found, in monitoring marketing practices in 42 nations, that the baby-formula industry still uses &quot;dangerous and, in some cases, illegal methods&quot; to sell its products.    &quot;The group's evidence reveals methodical corporate dumping of large quantities of baby milk on Third World hospitals, a practice which violates national law in some countries, and defies World Health Organization restrictions on the marketing of infant formula,&quot; said the statement.    Janice Mantell, Action's executive director, said the boycott would be renewed if Nestle doesn't develop a plan to end free distribution of its infant formula by Oct. 4, the fourth anniversary of the conclusion of the last boycott. She also said New York-based American Home Products Corp., makers of Wyeth infant formula, also would be &quot;the target of a public pressure campaign&quot; if it doesn't halt &quot;marketing practices which endanger infant health.&quot; She didn't specify what action the group may take against that company, though.    Action objects to the practice of encouraging new mothers in poor countries to forgo breast-feeding by distributing free formula to them through hospitals. Outside hospitals, the water supply and other conditions in such countries may not be sanitary, and mothers may not understand the usage directions, the group says.    Using infant formula improperly can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea and gastroenteritis, said Roy Brown, a pediatrician and chairman of the Department of Community Medicine at St. Joseph Hospital in Paterson, N.J.    Both American Home Products and Nestle denied violating the World Health Organization code or engaging in dumping in Third World hospitals and health centers.    Thad Jackson, special issues director for Nestle, said his company is in &quot;full compliance&quot; both in its agreement with the International Boycott Committee, to which Action belongs, and with the World Health Organization.    &quot;We have been the industry leader in complying with the code and more or less set the standard for how the code is interpreted,&quot; Mr. Jackson said. Nestle controls between 40% and 50% of the world-wide infant formula market.    Characterizing Action's accusation of dumping as &quot;simply not true,&quot; he said: &quot;We are allowed under the (WHO) code to provide free and low-cost supplies, and this is what we have been doing.&quot; He added, &quot;We make sure the supplies are used properly.&quot; Mr. Jackson said Nestle wouldn't change its marketing practices in the Third World in the wake of Action's proposed boycott.    The proposed boycott wouldn't affect plans by Nestle's Carnation Co. unit to market infant formula in the U.S., said Dick Curd, a spokesman for Carnation. Yesterday, Los Angeles-based Carnation unveiled two new infant formula products, marking Nestle's first big move into the $1.6 billion U.S. market.    &quot;Carnation's plans don't involve the marketing of infant formula outside the U.S. or in developing countries,&quot; he said.    Carol Emerling, a spokeswoman at American Home Products, said her company also was in &quot;full compliance&quot; with the WHO code. She declined specifically to comment on how American Home Products would respond to Action, saying, &quot;We don't have the information. We don't know what we have to respond to.&quot;    But she said: &quot;Our main response will be what our practices have been for several years: Following the WHO code where it is relevant and either entirely or to a very great extent elsewhere depending on the local conditions.&quot; Ms. Emerling stressed that American Home Products has supported breast-feeding in writing since 1955 and that all its infant-formula labels say &quot;Breast milk is best for babies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
