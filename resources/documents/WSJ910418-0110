Colin Powell poses an unusual dilemma for many oftoday's black leaders. As the first black chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, he is too &quot;positive&quot; a role model tobe ignored, yet too politically incorrect to beenthusiastically praised. A century after Frederick Douglasspleaded with President Abraham Lincoln to letAfrican-Americans share the Union's military burden, CorettaScott King, Jesse Jackson and other pillars of the civilrights establishment are complaining that blacks bear toomuch of it.   Some call black servicemen and women &quot;economicconscriptees.&quot; (&quot;If that war breaks out, our youth will burnfirst,&quot; Mr. Jackson said two days before Operation DesertStorm began.) Others, like Howard University politicalscience Prof. Ron Walters, a former Jackson adviser, say thePentagon is &quot;skimming the cream off the black middle class&quot;and should &quot;adjust&quot; its qualifying tests so that they will nolonger reject poor blacks.</LP><TEXT>   No one bristles at that suggestion more than black careerofficers do. &quot;Black leaders should leave those kids alone,&quot;says retired Marine Lt.-Gen. Frank Peterson who, as theMarine Corps' first black pilot, battled prejudice at manylevels. &quot;The black youngsters who join the military today arewell educated, talented and working hard to improvethemselves. Black leaders should concentrate on trying toopen up more opportunities for these kids when they get out.&quot;   The protests of black leaders against the black presencein the military may, however, help explain why black supportlagged well below white support for the Persian Gulf war.They may also help to explain why a recent National OpinionResearch Center survey of racial attitudes found that mostwhites think blacks are &quot;less patriotic&quot; than whites.   As a black Vietnam-era draftee who hated that war butloves his country, I think black reservations about the Gulfwar resulted less from a lack of patriotism than from awidespread perception of unfairness, a perception that blacksare contributing disproportionately to defend a society thatcontinues to deny too many opportunities to blacks outsidethe military.   If there is any point on which Gen. Powell and othermilitary officers stand on common ground with civil rightsleaders, it is that the question should not be why themilitary has so many blacks but, rather, why do civiliancompanies have so few?   America's military in the past two decades has attractedmore black talent and created more opportunities for blacksthan any other sector of American society. Although blacksare 12% of America's population, they fill 29% of thepositions in the army: 32% of its enlisted personnel and 11%of its officers, including 27 of its 374 generals.   Mr. Walters is right that today's hightech military isdipping deeper into the best and brightest of black America.A 1982 Brookings Institute study found that 42% of blackyouths who met the military's requirements were enlisting,while only 14% of similarly qualified white youths werejoining up. With Department of Labor projections showingwhite males to be the slowest-growing sector of the workforceover the next 20 years, the military may have a lot to teachprivate companies that are looking for the best way to hireand promote minority talent without resorting to quotas.   Charles Moskos, military sociology professor atNorthwestern University, suggests that the military's levelplaying field has itself proved to be particularly attractiveto blacks simply by rewarding merit, not race. &quot;Where else,&quot;he asks, &quot;does a young black man know that, with a littlehard work, he can earn the opportunity to yell orders atyoung white men?&quot;   Conversely, the lingering racism in the civilian world isexemplified by the relative difficulty black colonels andgenerals -- who have been retiring in record numbers inrecent years -- have faced in getting the seniorexecutive-level positions major corporations routinely offerto retiring white officers.   Gen. Peterson is one of the growing number of exceptions.Now director of corporate aviation for Du Pont, he says hewas hired along with retired Navy Rear Adm. William Powell asa result of a Du Pont effort to eliminate color barriers inexecutive recruitment. But, he notes, &quot;You still have blackretired four-stars out there who have not been welcomed bycorporate America.&quot;   Blacks' success in the military has not come easily.Blacks have fought in every war America has fought, but neverbefore in roles as central as those played by Gen. Powell andLt. Gen. Calvin Waller, second-in-command to Gen. H. NormanSchwarzkopf. In World War II, segregation and discriminationat first kept blacks out of combat roles. But the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People's&quot;Double-V&quot; slogan (victory against fascism abroad and victoryagainst discrimination at home) won breakthroughs like the&quot;Tuskegee Airmen,&quot; the first and only all-black combat flyingunit. In 1948, President Harry Truman ordered the military todesegregate.   Even then, blacks felt some ambiguity about thisaccomplishment. As blacks took a disproportionate share offront-line duty and combat casualties in the Vietnam War'searly years (black combat casualties reached 22% of the totalin the years 1965-67, according to the Department ofDefense), Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, StokelyCarmichael and other blacks joined the anti-war coalition.Yet, moderate voices like the NAACP's Roy Wilkins andcolumnist Carl Rowan held to the &quot;double-v&quot; argument: Ifblacks refused to fight for their country, they could notrightfully demand fair treatment in it.   During those difficult days, and while support for theVietnam War unraveled outside the military, a revolution wastaking place inside. Racial friction on military bases andNavy ships around the world prompted the Pentagon to take itswar against segregation a step further: a vigorous humanrelations campaign designed to attack racial prejudiceitself.   With that, it was no longer enough to say blithely that&quot;The only color that matters is green (or blue or khaki).&quot;Courses in black history and racial dynamics became anintegral part of training. More important, the efficiencyreports that help determine promotions were revised toinclude evaluations of race relations skills.   &quot;Ironically I saw Dr. King's dream come alive in Vietnam,&quot;says Wallace Terry, a Time magazine reporter in Vietnam andauthor of the best-seller &quot;Bloods,&quot; about black soldiers inVietnam. &quot;I saw, as King said, `the sons of former slaves andthe sons of former slave owners' sit down together at `thetable of brotherhood.'&quot;   Gen. Peterson concedes that the military's human relationsmethods have limited applicability to the private sector,whether you're talking about its training methods (&quot;Shavetheir heads, put them in boot camp and make them all afraid,&quot;he quips) or its discipline standards.   Nevertheless, he says, there is much the private sectorcan learn, when it comes to changing traditions of corporateculture that discriminate against talented minorities andwomen: &quot;Make sure that pay is based on performance and you'llget the kind of results you want.&quot;   Mr. Terry suggests that white resentment of programsintended to upgrade minority opportunities can be avoided byconstructing the programs not as an &quot;advantage&quot; to minoritiesbut as &quot;support&quot; for those whose productivity is held back bydeficiencies that can be alleviated. A good example, he says,was the &quot;catch-up program for reading, math and speaking&quot;devised by Gen. David Jones, then-commander of the U.S. AirForce (Europe), for whom Mr. Terry worked as an adviser in1971. The program was designed &quot;not as a favor to blacks, butas a way to enable them to become more productive.&quot;   Of course, the military has not reached racial perfection.Black pilots and senior officers number more than they usedto, but still less than their proportion in the generalpopulation.Nevertheless, with more blacks in its managementranks than you can find in similar civilian jobs, America'smilitary offers a realization of a hard-fought dream that Dr.King said was &quot;as old as the American Dream.&quot;For the captainsof private industry, it is a model worthy of praise andimitation in their own never-ending battles against theenemies of justice, equality and profitability.   ---   Mr. Page, a nationally syndicated columnist for theChicago Tribune, won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for commentary.</TEXT></DOC>
