This geometrical configurationsimulates plasma confined in a mirror device. In the presence of boundaries,plasmas may support waves that have no counterparts in unbounded geometry.It it this class of rf modes that we examine for possible coupling tominority ions through the cyclotron resonance. As our basic plasma configuration,we examine a cold, uniform, magnetized, plasma cylinder, separated radiallyfrom a vacuum region by a free interface. The plasma is composed of electrons,a dominant ion species, and one or more species of heavier, low density(minority) ions. The rf wave dispersion characteristics and couplingto the heavy minority ions in this sharp boundary model are explored.To simulate a magnetic beach, which is a characteristic of a mirror magneticfield, weak axial inhomogeneities are introduced, and the implicationsare examined.</TEXT></DOC>
