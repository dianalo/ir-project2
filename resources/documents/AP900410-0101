Stepan Sitarian, a deputy Soviet premier, said such Westernlimits ``should no longer remain a sacred cow.''   The premier also hailed a new international accord, reachedMonday in Bonn, that committed the Soviets to backing free-marketeconomic reform. He said the pact conformed to President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's reform program, known as ``perestroika.''   ``Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in theBonn document are in line with our philosophy of perestroika andhave a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the SovietUnion,'' Sitarian said in a speech to the 35-nation Conference onEconomic Cooperation in Europe. The conference ends Wednesday.   Sitarian also made it clear the Soviets hope for Western help incarrying out economic change. He said success in implementing theBonn accord ``will depend on countries meeting each other halfway.''   Sitarian said the West's so-called COCOM restrictions onhigh-technology sales to the East bloc present ``certaincomplications'' to restructuring the Soviet economy.   COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee ForMultilateral Export Controls. The Western COCOM restrictions wereadopted during the Cold War to prevent the Soviet bloc from gainingsensitive technology.   ``We believe that few businessmen would be willing to cooperatein an outdated technical basis,'' Sitarian told reporters after hisspeech.   ``We propose that East-West consultations begin on rules togovern the transfer of dual-purpose technology,'' he said,referring to products and equipment that can be used for civilianor military purposes.   He said the Soviet Union is willing to agree to inspectionprocedures so the West can verify that high-technology equipment isnot being used for military purposes.   The COCOM nations are already working on proposals for looseningrestrictions on technology sales to reforming East bloc countries.However, the United States has indicated it will take a tougherstand toward the Soviet Union.   Sitarian said the Soviet Union is committed to carrying outprice reforms as soon as possible. He said it is also eager to makeits currency, the ruble, convertible.   In Monday's pact, the 35 nations at the conference _ the UnitedStates, Canada, and all European countries except Albania _informally endorsed a document committing them to support privateproperty, free enterprise and multiparty democracy.   Such a move would have been unthinkable months ago before thewave of democratic and economic reform in the East bloc.</TEXT></DOC>
