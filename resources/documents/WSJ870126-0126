GE said it will close a plant that puts controllers on Japanese-built robots in Plymouth, Fla., ending all operations by August. About 118 employees will lose jobs and the building and grounds will be sold, the company added. At peak employment in 1983, the plant had 225 employees.    GE blamed the shutdown on general retrenchment in the auto industry and intense competition in other industries in which it tried to make robotics sales.    GE bought the Florida plant in 1969. It produced photographic and incandescent lamps until it became part of an ambitious effort by GE to tackle the factory-automation business. When GE's chairman, John F. Welch, pushed the company into factory automation more than five years ago, the company said it would be a $1 billion business by 1985; instead, it became a $550 million business.    Last summer, GE put the computerized numerical, programmable and cell-controller parts of its factory-automation business into a joint venture with Japan's Fanuc Ltd. called GE Fanuc Automation Corp. It said that it expects the venture to have sales of $250 million this year and to be profitable.    Parts of GE's factory-automation business that aren't in the Fanuc joint venture include motors and systems that drive steel and paper mills, cutting and grinding tools and motor controls, among other things.    GE said Friday that the robotics industry is taking longer than expected to develop and that the segment in which it concentrated, automated welding, &quot;is much smaller than was originally anticipated.&quot; Robotics accounts for less than 2% of GE's total revenue from factory automation.    GE said &quot;eligible employees&quot; at the Plymouth plant will get severance pay based on current pay rates and length of service as well as medical and life-insurance coverage for one year following the plant's closure. </TEXT></DOC>
