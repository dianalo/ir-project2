The Agency is therefore by this Notice prohibiting any further saleor use of heptachlor for seed treatment. Under the special circumstancespresented here, the Agency is also providing holders of existing stocksof products affected by this Notice an opportunity to demonstrate to theAgency that continued sale or use of their products would not be inconsistentwith the purposes of FIFRA and would not have undreasonable adverse effectson the environment.

Parts II containsthe Agency's determination pursuant to section 6(a)(1) of FIFRA applicableto existing stocks of such registrations.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Regulatory History</ITAG>A. Notice of Intent to CancelPrior to 1974, heptachlor (along with a related compound, chlordane) wasregistered for a wide variety of insecticide uses. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 26, 1974 (39 FR 11298), the Administratorissued a notice of intent to cancel registrations for most uses of heptachlor(and chlordane). The basis for the notice of intent to cancel was evidencethat helptachlor and chlordane has demonstrated toxis effects which mayhave significant adverse effecs on human health, and evidence that bothchemicals persist in the environment for many years after application andas such are subject to considerable movement from the site of actual application.The evidence on toxicity demonstrated that heptachlor and its metabolite,heptachlor epoxide, had been found to induce tumors in mice and that therewas evidence of embryotoxicity in mice and possibly rats as well. Becauseof the persistence and wide application of heptachlor and chlordane products,heptachlor epoxide residues were routinely found in water, food sources,and human adult and fetal tissue. The Administrator therefore proposedto cancel all registered uses of chloradane and heptachlor except thoseuses for subterranean termite control and dipping of nonfood plants.b. The Suspension of Heptachlor ProductsOn July 29, 1975, the Administrator issued a notice of intent to suspendthe registration of heptachlor and chlordane that were subject to the noticeof intent to cancel. The grounds for the notice of intent to suspend were``new evidence * * * which confirm(ed) and heighten(ed) the human cancerhazard posed by (chlordane and heptachlor)'' and the Adminstrator's determinationthat the cancellation proceeding resulting from the notice of intent tocancel would not be complete in time to ``avert substantial additions ofthese persistent and ubiquitous compounds to already serious human andenvironmental burden.'' The notice of intent to suspend applied to alluses covered by the notice of intent to cancel.An evidentiary hearing on the proposed suspension took place between Augustand December of 1975. On December 12, 1975, the hearing examiner publisheda recommended decision dismissing the notice of intent to suspend. Thebasis for this recommendation was the hearing examiner's unwillingnessto find ``conclusively'' that heptachlor and chlordane are carcinogensin laboratory animals.The recommended decision discussed in some detail the potential hazardsand benefits associated with chlordane and heptachlor use. Included inthe recommended decision was a discussion of the use of heptachlor forseed treatment. The decision noted that approximately 200,000 pounds ofheptachlor had been used for seed treatment in 1974, and that inadequatealternatives for seed treatment existed at that time. The hearing examinertherefore recommended that heptachlor for seed treatment not be suspendedeven if the Administrator were to disagree with the examiner on the questionof the hazard posed by chlordane and heptachlor. On December 24, 1975, the Administrator issued his decision on the proposedsuspension of chlordane and heptachlor products. <T3>See</T3> 41 FR 7572. In his decision, the Administrator disagreed withthe hearing examiner and determined that the evidence at the hearing onthe question of whether chlordane and heptachlor posed a risk of cancerto man did support a finding of ``imminent hazard'' sufficient to justifya suspension pursuant to section 6(c). The Administrator therefore ordereda suspension of a number of chlordane and heptachlor uses during the pendencyof the cancellation hearing. As to seed treatment however, the Administratorfound that no adequate alternatives to treatment with heptachlor existedat that time, and therefore found that the need for heptachlor for seedtreatment exceeded the risks of such use during the time necessary to completethe cancellation hearing. Heptachlor for seed treatment was thus not oneof the uses suspended by the Administrator. The Administrator's suspension order as upheld by the United States Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia. <T3>See Environmental Defense Fund</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 548 F.2d 998 (1976). The Court of Appeals specifically upheldthe Administrator's findings with respect to the cancer hazards posed bychlordane and heptachlor. 548 F.2d at 1006-1010. C. Settlement of the Cancellation Proceeding The cancellation proceeding continued until November of 1977, at whichtime the parties entered into settlement negotiations. The negotiationsresulted in an agreement which was ratified in a Final Order issued bythe Administrator on March 6, 1978, and which was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 24, 1978 (43 FR 12372). The Final Orderresulted in the eventual cancellation of all products subject to the originalnotice of intent to cancel. Some of the cancellations became effectiveon the date of the Final Order, while other cancellations were to becomeeffective according to a ``phased out'' schedule incorporated in the Order.For seed treatment, the effective date of cancellation was September 1,1982, for barley, oats, wheat, rye, and corn, and July 1, 1983, for sorghum.The Order also contained production limitations; production of heptachlorfor seed treatment was limited to 175,000 pounds annually from 1978 to1982 and to 100,000 pounds in 1983. In addition to the Final Order, the Administrator issued a Statement asto Basis for Settlement on March 6, 1978 (43 FR 12375). In this Statement,the Administrator noted that even though the settlement made it unnecessaryfor him to resolve the dispute concerning the hazards of chlordane andheptachlor, ``(t)here is much to be said for a policy that continued humanexposure to persistent pesticides such as (chlordane and heptachlor) thatraise a question of risk even though unresolved and residues resultingfrom their use should be restricted and eventually eliminated whereverthe pesticide use can be dispensed with * * *'' The purpose of the phasedcancellations was to provide a ``transition period'' to allow users tomake an orderly adjustment to alternative crops or pest control technologieswhere possible or to promote development of alternative pest control technologieswhere none then existed. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Existing Stocks Determination </ITAG>The sale and use of existing stocks of pesticide products canceled aftera notice of intent to cancel is issued pursuant to section 6(b) of FIFRAare controlled by section 6(a)(1), which provides in pertinent part: ``theAdministrator may permit the continued sale and use of existing stocksof a pesticide whose registration is canceled under [section 6(b)] to suchextent, under such conditions, and for such uses as he may specify if hedetermines that such sale or use is not inconsistent with the purposesof (FIFRA) and will not have unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.''In the Final Order of cancellation issued on March 6, 1978, the Administratorestablished a schedule calling for phased cancellations with productionlimits, and announced that the Agency would permit continued sale and useof existing stocks after a particular cancellation took effect. As noted earlier, the purpose of the phased cancellation was to allow foran orderly transition away from the canceled uses. The limitation on productionwas with an eye towards assuring that the transition would be a relativelyshort one (as mentioned, the limit for production of heptachlor for seedtreatment was 175,000 pounds per year, less than the annual amount believedto have been used in 1974 for seed treatment). At the time the Agency issuedthe Final Order, it was expected that sale and use of existing stocks ofcanceled products would cease approximately within 1 year of the effectivecancellation date. The existing stocks allowance and phased cancellation was thus expectedto result in a transition period of approximately 6 years (until 1984)for users of heptachlor treated seeds. The Agency has learned, however,that heptachlor continues to be available for seed treatment today, morethan 10 years after the settlement leading to cancellation of that use.The information available to the Agency suggests that approximately 160,000pounds of heptachlor remain available for use in seed treatment; that approximately2,000 pounds are used each year; and thus at current rates, heptachlorcould continue to be used on seeds for another 80 years. Under section 6(a)(1), the Agency may permit the continued sale and useof existing stocks of a canceled pesticide only if the Agency determinesthat such sale and use will be consistent with FIFRA and will not resultin unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. In determining whethersale or use of a pesticide will result in unreasonable adverse effectson the environment, the Agency must examine the risks and benefits associatedwith the use of such pesticide. <T3>See</T3> FIFRA section 2(bb). Despite the hazards associated with heptachloruse, in 1978 the Agency determined that the lack of alternatives to heptachlorfor seed treatment tipped the risk/benefit scale in favor of continueduse of heptachlor for a transitional period. The 6-year transitional period contemplated in 1978 would have ended morethan 4 years ago. The Agency believes that 10 years was more than sufficientfor users to find alternatives to heptachlor seed treatment. Moreover,although some heptachlor continues to be used, the amounts used today suggestthat alternatives now exist; the transition way from heptachlor seed treatmenthas largely been completed (the amount of heptachlor used for seed treatmentin 1987 was only 1 percent of the amount used in 1974). Thus the specialbenefits associated with potential dislocation during a transitional periodno longer apply to continued sale and use of heptachlor for seed treatment.While the benefits associated with heptachlor seed treatment have greatlydiminished in the past 10 years, the Agency's general concerns with theuse of heptachlor for any of the uses covered by the 1974 notice of intentto cancel have not diminished. The Agency is aware of at least two instanceswhere seeds treated with heptachlor eventually found their way (contraryto label requirements) into cattle mash, resulting in the contaminationof a large number of cows and a significant volume of milk. In one of theseinstances, total losses for all affected parties are anticipated to exceed16 million dollars; in the other instance, over 1,100 cattle were contaminatedwith heptachlor epoxide residues. The Agency has also received reportsof other incidents of heptachlor epoxide contamination in swine and poultrywhich may also have resulted from the misuse of treated seed, althoughspecific causes of the contamination have not been confirmed by the investigations.If heptachlor seed treatments continue, such misuse could well occur again;an investigation by the United States Food and Drug Administration andthe Department of Agriculture uncovered over 100 violations involving theillegal use of obsolete pesticide treated seeds in animal feeds. Whilethe potential for misuse is substantial, it must also be kept in mind thatthe Agency action taken in the 1970's was based upon concerns associatedwith approved label use of heptachlor as well as with misuse.Under all the circumstances, the Agency can no longer find that continuedsale or use of heptachlor for seed treatment will be consistent with FIFRAand will not have unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. TheAgency therefore no longer believes that such sale or use is consistentwith section 6(a)(1) of FIFRA. Where the Agency finds that continued saleand use of existing stocks of a canceled pesticide would not be consistentwith section 6(a)(1), the Agency may not permit such continued sale oruse. Accordingly, the Agency is hereby serving notice that sale or useof heptachlor stocks for seed treatment is no longer permitted, and thatany further sale or use, unless specifically permitted by the Agency, shallbe a violation of section 12(a)(1)(A) and/or section 12(a)(2)(K) of FIFRA.Given all the circumstances of this case, the Agency believes it appropriateto provide any interested person with the opportunity to demonstrate tothe Agency that continued sale or use of heptachlor for seed treatmentwould be consistent with FIFRA and would not result in unreasonable adverseeffects on the environment. Any person who wishes to make such a demonstration,must submit to the Agency by July 10, 1989 factual information sufficientto support a finding that continued sale and/or use of heptachlor for seedtreatment would be consistent with section 6(a)(1). Such a submission shouldinclude information concerning the extent of existing stocks, informationon the economic, social or environmental benefits associated with the continueduse of such stocks, and information addressing the hazards associated withheptachlor use as set forth in the notice of intent to cancel in 1974,and the notice of intent to suspend, the preliminary decision on suspension,and the Administrator's final decision on suspension in 1975 and 1976.In addition, such a submission should address the means to reduce or eliminatethe potential for misuse of heptachlor treated seeds. Any other personwishing to comment on whether continued sale or use of existing stocksof heptachlor for seed treatment should be permitted must also supply suchcomments by July 10, 1989. All submissions and comments should be addressedto the address listed under the ADDRESS unit.If a timely request to allow sale or use of existing stocks is received,the Agency will consider the request and make a final determination asto whether sale or use of existing stocks should be permitted. Unless anduntil a final determination to the contrary is made, no sale or use ofheptachlor stocks for treatment of seeds will be permitted. If no requestto allow sale or use of existing stocks is received within 60 days of publicationof this Notice, the prohibition on sale and use of existing stocks announcedin this Notice shall become final.Any disposal of heptachlor resulting from this Notice must be in accordancewith all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, includingthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In this regard, it shouldbe noted that products that contain heptachlor as the sole active ingredientare subject to the provisions of Subtitle C of RCRA and are potential ``P''wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.33. A separate fact sheet has been preparedwhich provides additional guidance regarding the status of heptachlor seedtreatment products as hazardous wastes. Copies may be obtained from JamesG.
