The latest incident, disclosed yesterday, stems from trading by a brother of one of the British merchant bank's corporate-finance directors. According to London's stock exchange, government investigators are examining 1985 trades by Brian Evans in Arthur Bell andamp; Sons PLC shortly before and during a successful #360 million ($582.1 million) takeover bid by Guinness PLC, then a Grenfell client.    Brian Evans is the brother of 42-year-old Philip Evans, a Morgan Grenfell mergers-and-acquisitions adviser who worked on the Bell bid. At the time of the trading, Brian Evans shared a London house with his brother.    There hasn't been any indication that Philip Evans was linked to -- or aware of -- his brother's trading in Bell, a whisky distiller. Yesterday, a Morgan Grenfell spokesman said Philip Evans first learned of the trading when London's Financial Times newspaper called him for comment earlier this week.    &quot;We are assured by (Philip) Evans that nothing improper has taken place, and we are satisfied with that,&quot; the Morgan spokesman said. He added that the bank isn't currently planning an investigation into the dealing.    Morgan officials said bank compliance officers met with Philip Evans yesterday to discuss the matter. But they said they didn't expect him to resign. There is &quot;absolutely no question of his leaving,&quot; a spokeswoman said.    The latest investigation also doesn't implicate Morgan Grenfell. But it certainly does little to boost the bank's efforts to put recent insider-trading scandals behind it.    In addition, the widening revelations of suspicious share dealing likely will make it harder for the City, London's financial district, to convince an increasingly skeptical public that insider trading is only practiced by a so-called errant few. As the City's image grows more tarnished, support for stricter regulation probably will increase.    Morgan Grenfell's troubles surfaced last November, when a securities-division director, Geoffrey Collier, resigned amid allegations that he had traded on nonpublic information. Last week, he received a one-year suspended prison sentence and #25,000 fine after pleading guilty to insider trading.    Soon after Mr. Collier's resignation last year, investigators at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry began looking into separate allegations of improper share-price manipulation in Guinness's #2.53 billion acquisition of Distillers Co. So far, two other senior executives -- although not personally involved in any insider-trading allegations -- have resigned after Morgan Grenfell identified &quot;breaches of established procedures and policies.&quot;    In a statement issued yesterday by his lawyers here, Brian Evans confirmed the trading, which he said he hadn't discussed with his brother. &quot;I totally refute any suggestion that I had or used any sort of inside knowledge in this transaction or that there has been any impropriety,&quot; his statement said. Philip Evans didn't return phone calls yesterday. A secretary said he was in meetings &quot;all day.&quot;    Stock-exchange officials said the investigation currently is being handled by the Department of Trade and Industry, which generally leads insider-trading probes here. The exchange said the department has been aware of the trading since December. Department of Trade and Industry officials declined to comment on the matter yesterday.    Brian Evans's statement said that a nominee company bought 80,000 Bell shares on his behalf on June 10, 1985, four days before Guinness launched its bid. Given Bell's share price on that day, the stake had an indicated value of #128,000. After Guinness announced its bid, the nominee company sold the stake, apparently at an #80,000 profit, according to exchange officials.    &quot;I did not disclose this decision (the purchase of Bell shares) to my brother, nor have I ever discussed any of my investments with him,&quot; Brian Evans's statement went on. &quot;At no time has Philip ever discussed any of his business affairs with me, nor have I ever inquired in any way.&quot; He added: &quot;I . . . had no knowledge that he (Philip) was involved in the proposed acquisition of Bells.&quot;    Brian Evans said his investment had followed a London club conversation that he overheard, leading him &quot;to believe clearly that there was to be a change of ownership of Bells.&quot;    Morgan Grenfell shares traded at 387 pence ($6.26), unchanged, on London's stock exchange yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
