Most of the action centered around the issues of several bigfood companies that are involved in takeover activity.   ``The rest of the market is still on hold,'' said HildegardeZagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Market watchers said the subdued tone was largely due tounderlying uneasiness in advance of Wednesday's one-yearanniversary of the October stock market collapse.   On the eve of the anniversary of the debacle, it was anotherfairly slow day on the New York Stock Exchange, and brokers saidthey had lots of time on their hands.   Kraft stock shot up in heavy trading, in response to the $90 ashare offered late Monday by Philip Morris in an $11 billiontakeover offer. Philip Morris stock dropped, apparently becauseinvestors felt the acquisition would dilute the earnings of thecigarette and food giant.   Philip Morris said it has filed suit against Kraft and some ofits directors in an Illinois court.   In another major development in the food industry, Pillsburysaid its board of directors unanimously rejected a $60-a-sharetender offer from Grand Metropolitan of Britain.   Pillsbury later disclosed that it had filed a suit against GrandMet and Wendell Investments Ltd. for violations of the Shipping Actof 1916.</TEXT></DOC>
