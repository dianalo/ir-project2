This notice was based on information suppliedby the licensee dated December 6, 1984, as supplemented October 20, 1986.However, in order to more fully address some of the NUREG-0737 issues listedabove, the licensee has submitted a letter dated October 18, 1985. Thisletter responds to questions raised by the NRC staff regarding justificationwhere the licensee's position on proposed changes differed from the guidanceprovided in Generic Letter 83-36 and is the subject of this notice.Specifically, the submittal transmitted supplementary information concerningthe following NUREG-0737 Items which are not addressed by the other submittals:(a) <T3>Item II.F.1.3 Containment High-Range Radiation Monitor: </T3>The NUREG-0737guidance states that two channels remain operable. The TS change proposedby the licensee would require that one out of two channels must remainoperable.(b) <T3>Item II.F.1.4 Containment Pressure Monitor and Item II.F.1.5 ContainmentWater Level Monitor: </T3>The NUREG-0737 guidance states that two channelsfor each parameter remain operable or an inoperable channel be restoredto service within seven days or the plant shutdown within seven days. TheTS change proposed by the licensee would require that the inoperable channelbe restored in 30 days or either an alternate monitoring method be initiatedor the plant shutdown in 48 hours.(c) <T3>Item II.F.1.6 Containment Hydrogen Monitor: </T3>The NUREG-0737 guidancestates that two channels should remain operable and that if both are lost,the plant must be shutdown within seven days. The TS change proposed bythe licensee would require that the inoperable channel be restored within30 days or either an alternate monitoring method be initiated or the plantshutdown.In each case, the proposed change is an enhancement over the present TSrequirement.Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsprovided above and has supplied the following information. For Items II.F.1.3,II.F.1.4, and II.F.1.5, the approach is consistent with the fact that plantequipment could be divided into three categories: (1) Equipment necessaryto prevent an accident; (2) equipment used to mitigate an accident; (3)equipment used for monitoring during and following an accident. The TSis consistent with a ``defense in depth'' approach and is appropriate formonitoring equipment (the third category given above) which is used followinga low probability accident. For Item II.F.1.6, the Containment Oxygen Monitorsupplies redundant information for which there is a separate TS requirementand action statement for this instrumentation. In addition, the proposedaction for all these statements are consistent with the action statementsfor other accident monitoring instrumentation (criteria which is also allowedby NUREG-0737). Therefore:(1) The proposed license amendment would not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,because the proposed accident monitoring instrumentation does not affectprevious accident probability analyses.(2) The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, becauseno new mode of failure is introduced.(3) The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction inthe margin of safety, because additional information provided to the operatorfollowing an accident would enhance the safety of the plant.Based on the above reasoning, the licensee has determined that the proposedchanges involve no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff hasreviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determinationand agrees with the licensee's analyses. Accordingly, the Commission proposesto determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significanthazards consideration.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules and Procedures Branch,Division of Rules and Records, Office of Administration and Resources Management,U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should citethe publication date and page number of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland,from 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave tointervene is discussed below.By May 4, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing heldwould take place after issuance of the amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, of may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,Washingfton, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at (800) 325-6000 (in Missouri (800) 342-6700). The Western Unionoperator would be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addressed to Robert A. Capra: petitioner's name and telephone number;date petition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle,New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition and/orrequest, that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of good causefor the granting of a late petition and/or request. That determinationwill be based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated December 6, 1984 supplemented October 18, 1985 and October20, 1986 which are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washingfton, DC 20555, and atthe State University of New York, Penfield Library, Reference and DocumentsDepartment, Oswego, New York 13126.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of March.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert A.
