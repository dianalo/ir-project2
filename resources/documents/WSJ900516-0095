Theconventional line on the Ayer flap is that Mr. Thornburghdidn't support his deputy's instinct to rely on the advice ofthe department's &quot;professional&quot; civil servants. If this istrue, we'd say that Mr. Thornburgh deserves credit forattempting to create a department that speaks with one voicein an Executive Branch that for years has weakened itsinstitutional powers by speaking with too many voices.   The Founding Fathers wanted a unified Executive Branch sothat it could hold up its side in the separation of powers,posing itself against the countervailing forces in Congress.The President and his aides are supposed to adopt and standaccountable for a clear set of policies. Mr. Thornburgh hasconsciously pursued this goal.</LP><TEXT>   This has angered the career staff, which might not be allthat bad. It had become standard operating procedure inWashington for career staffers in league with loose-wheelofficials to sabotage policies they don't like or thatthreaten the bureaucracy.   One reason Deputy Attorney General Ayer resigned last weekwas that he wanted to support a radical proposal by the U.S.Sentencing Commission, which would have multiplied by up to50 times the punishments for companies convicted ofregulatory or other white-collar crimes. Shareholders offirms convicted for environmental or securities violations,even when the culprit was one low-level employee, could havehad to pay huge new fines out of earnings. It is an entirelylegitimate position that such a policy makes little economicsense.   Mr. Ayer, however, sent a letter to the SentencingCommission in February saying that Justice agreed these newguidelines were &quot;urgently needed.&quot; In fact, many officials atthe White House were horrified at the proposals. White HouseCounsel Boyden Gray asked Robert Ross, one of Mr.Thornburgh's top aides, what was going on. Mr. Ayer soonthereafter sent another letter to the Sentencing Commission,retracting the endorsement of the guidelines, which havesince been shelved.   We've noted before that for all his accomplishments,President Reagan failed to protect the institutional powersof his office. Terry Eastland, who was the spokesman forAttorney General Meese's Justice Department, is writing abook on &quot;Conservatives in Power&quot; that emphasizes theimportance of a unified, energetic Executive Branch. Heargues, for example, that there wouldn't have been so muchbickering in the White House if President Reagan had firedDavid Stockman and others who leaked as a way to win internalpolicy battles.   Mr. Thornburgh is reassigning some of the aides he broughtto the department from his native Pennsylvania, but signaledhis continued interest in building a unified Executive Branchby selecting William Barr as his new deputy. Mr. Barr, headof Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, is appropriately enoughan expert on separation of powers. If more departments followthe Justice model, George Bush could be the first Presidentin many years to leave the office stronger than he found it.</TEXT></DOC>
