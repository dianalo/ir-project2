In the1980s, state budgets got bigger, but now, with revenues fromtaxes falling below outlays, many states are in the red. Redis a color people tend to notice, and voters everywhere havesuddenly become more attentive to the normally obscure fiscalbehavior of their state capitals. In this series, we're goingto take a look at the issues, starting with a phenomenon thatinvariably drove budgets higher -- the swelling public workforce.   While some Governors are still asking for more taxes tobail them out (notwithstanding the unhappy experience of JimFlorio in New Jersey), others are lopping thousands off thepayroll.</LP><TEXT>   Cutting back on public employees can be a positive step;payroll numbers turn out to be a good proxy for total budgetexpenditures. One of the fundamental errors of stategovernance has been using the surplus from a flush year tofund an ongoing program: The staff to man that programusually has to be carried in lean years.   State and local payroll spots have more than tripled since1952. This isn't merely a reflection of the population. By1988, there were 147 &quot;full-time equivalent&quot; (FTE) positionsin state government for every 10,000 Americans, against only61 in 1952. At the local level, the comparable figures were358 vs. 195.   The Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, whichhas been promoting badly needed budget discipline in thatstate, supplied us with some of the most current data onpublic-employee growth during the 1980s. From 1980 to 1989,Florida registered the largest FTE increase, 43%. Of course,Florida grew rapidly in population during that period, thoughnot as fast as its payroll burden. The same might be said ofUtah, number two in FTE rise at 36%. But what of Wyoming,with 34% growth through the '80s? You might think that manywere hired there in the energy boom years, but in fact thebig surge occurred in the bust years in the latter half ofthe decade.   New York, despite little population increase, is among thebig public-employee gainers, at 30%, but at least that trendbegan to turn around in the Empire State by the start of1989. Not so in Arizona, whose employee count was stillrising at nearly 12% as the air went out of the economy in1989. Ditto Vermont. In Connecticut and Kansas the damage hadalready been done: approximately 29% FTE leaps through thedecade, with stable populations. Is it any wonder KansasGovernor Mike Hayden raised taxes, and was voted out fordoing so, or that Lowell Weicker in Hartford now wants toinstitute an income tax?   Kentucky was the fastest finisher of 1989, leading theU.S. with a 14% rise in that year alone, leaving it numbernine in the country for the whole '80s, with a flatpopulation. Maybe the new Toyota factory down the road gotthe politicians in Frankfort excited. Keep this up inBluegrass Country, and there won't be many people left forthe private sector to hire.   If those were the sinners, who were the frugal winners?West Virginia was by far the biggest pruner, reducing thepublic-worker level by 17.7% in the '80s. The state wasn'tlosing population that fast. Pennsylvania and Rhode Islandalso showed drop-offs that reflected their citizen counts.However, Iowa (FTEs up 27.6%), Ohio (up 22.1%) and NorthDakota (up 20.6%) could not make similar claims to livingwithin their diminishing means.   Conversely, Maryland, New Mexico and New Hampshire werethe growth-in-population states that could brag of havingkept the state work force at bay during the 1980s.   Body counts aren't the full payroll story. It matters howmuch the workers are paid. (And further, how productive theyare for the pay, assuming anyone could accurately measureanything so slippery.) The Advisory Commission onIntergovernmental Relations reports the following states paidan average of more than $30,000 annually to state and localemployees in 1988, the latest year available: Connecticut,New York, Michigan, California and Alaska (whose numbers aretypically off the charts). This, while 30 states were able topay less than $25,000. These averages don't include benefits.   California has the highest pay of any continental state, amajor reason why the state is staring in anguish into a $10billion budget hole. But the Golden State wasn't at the endof the paycheck rainbow. That glory belongs to the Districtof Columbia's government: a $33,384 average in 1988. Innumbers of workers, Marion Barry's D.C. was actually the mostbloated of any place. Its staffing was 74% above the U.S.average.   With all these findings in hand, we decided to test ouroriginal thesis about government employment being linked topublic spending. Sure enough, you see some familiar names:Besides Alaska and D.C., the states spending more than $3,200per capita on state and local operations were Connecticut,New York, New Jersey, California, Wyoming, Massachusetts,Delaware and Minnesota.   Statistical tables are no match for a good nose, and arising tax burden is a sure scent of trouble. But by the timevoters notice the rising taxes, the damage has already beendone: The state payroll hasn't just been padded, it's beencemented in place. Moral: Don't build up a work force thatpolitics will never let you dismantle.</TEXT></DOC>
