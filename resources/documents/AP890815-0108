The hymn-singing procession, with hundreds of colorful bannersbearing royal and Christian symbols, wound its way along a 2{-mileroute from the Louvre to the Opera and back via the stock marketdistrict.   Heading the procession was the Rev. Philippe Laguerie, leader offundamentalist Roman Catholics loyal to rebel Archbishop MarcelLefebvre, who was excommunicated by Pope John Paul II forconsecrating bishops in his order without authorization.   Organizers estimated about 30,000 people took part in the daylongevents, which began with a traditional Latin Mass in front of theLouvre _ a former royal palace that is now a museum.   The events were organized by religious fundamentalists and peopleidentified with extreme right-wing politics, two groups that overlapin France.   Jean-Claude Martinez, a leader of the extreme-right NationalFront who served in Parliament from 1986-88, was among thespectators. He described the participants as ``the right wing, thehard core of our electorate. About 90 percent would be NationalFront voters.''   Authorities refused permission to hold the rally at the Place dela Concorde, where King Louis XVI was beheaded, but Brigneau saidthe square in front of the Louvre was just as appropriate.   ``We are here in the heart of what was the Republic of fear, theRepublic of terror, the Republic of the revolution,'' he said,noting that during the Terror, prisoners were taken from cells justacross the Seine in the Conciergerie in carts past the Louvre to theguillotine.   ``There were many innocents, priests, men of the people, childrenwho were killed,'' said Gabrielle Fath, who said she came from herhome in Montbronn in eastern France ``to atone for all the crimescommitted in the Revolution.''   Gerard Champion, of Arras in northern France, said the officialbicentennial celebrations this year were ``grotesque. They showedthe desire of the authorities to continue to brainwash the peopleinto thinking the revolution was good.''   Champion and Mrs. Fath said they were not necessarily advocatinga return to monarchy. ``I'm not against democracy as such, as longas its founded on faith,'' Champion said.   Mrs. Fath said she would prefer ``a just and pure king like St.Louis,'' but could support a republican government ``if we had agood Catholic president who outlawed abortion.''   The day ended with an appeal to the Virgin Mary, asking her toaccept ``a public rehabilitation of France, which seems to haveabandoned its Christian vocation for the past 200 years.''   The vow was a renewal of King Louis XIII's consecration of Franceto Mary in 1638, which he ordered to be made every year on Aug. 15.   ``We are ardent and convinced counterrevolutionaries,'' saidFrancois Brigneau, an editorialist for the extreme-right weeklyNational Hebdo, in a welcoming speech.   Calling attention to a 13-foot replica of a guillotine on oneside of the square, Brigneau said it was symbolic of ``our hostilityto a bicentennial which insists on recounting a tragedy withcheerful words, and on glorifying the executioners without a thoughtto honoring the victims.''   The procession marked the feast of the Assumption, when RomanCatholics believe the Virgin Mary's body and soul were taken up intoheaven after her death.   A simultaneous but smaller procession, also with a statue ofMary, took place outside Notre Dame Cathedral a few blocks awayunder the auspices of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the RomanCatholic archbishop of Paris.</TEXT></DOC>
