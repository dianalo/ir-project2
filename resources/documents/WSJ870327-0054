The walkout, which idled 9,200 United Auto Workers members, was officially called over outstanding health and safety grievances, alleged production speedup and the transfer of certain jobs to non-UAW workers. But most of those complaints have been outstanding for several months, and many workers walking the picket line said the issues came to a head because of mounting frustrations with the company, particularly as the union gears up for national contract talks with the No. 1 auto maker this summer.    Tensions between GM and UAW Local 594 representing the Pontiac truck plants' workers, flared up earlier this year, when the union refused to make certain work rule changes requested by GM, and GM subsequently said it would shift medium-duty truck production to another plant.    GM declined to comment on the specific grievances but said in a prepared statement, &quot;We are extremely disappointed that agreement was not reached . . . We are eager to continue meeting with union officials to resolve the issues and end the strike as quickly as possible.&quot;    While the union shut down truck production in Pontiac, the company said in a separate announcement that it would temporarily halt car production at its Fiero plant here to reduce huge inventories of the slow-selling model. The three-week closing, beginning Monday, will idle 1,000 hourly workers.    This is the second time this year the company has adjusted production at the Fiero facility. In early January the plant was closed for two weeks, and when operations at the plant resumed, production was cut 32% and one work shift was eliminated.    Recently, the company &quot;sweetened&quot; incentives on 1986-model Fieros by increasing cash rebates to $1,200 from $500. At that time GM had a 130-day supply of unsold cars in dealer stock, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication. A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal.    The company has also suffered declining sales and high inventories in some of its truck lines, meaning the strike shouldn't have a significant financial effect unless it lasts a long time, analysts said. &quot;A strike would probably help,&quot; said Philip K. Fricke of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. In addition, most of the truck lines produced in Pontiac are also made at other plants.    Negotiators are scheduled to reconvene at 10 a.m. EST today. Roger Coats, Local 594 financial secretary, said they came close to resolving most of the grievances before breaking up around noon yesterday, but that they were still &quot;miles away&quot; on the complaints regarding subcontracting work to non-UAW sources.    The strike affects three general assembly plants. One plant just began making the company's new GMC Sierra and Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks, scheduled for official introduction in April. At current production schedules, the Pontiac complex was slated for 30% of that model's output. Another plant makes about half the company's GMC Jimmy and Chevrolet Blazer sport utility compact vehicles. The third plant builds all Chevrolet and GMC medium-duty trucks and GMC heavy-duty trucks.    Union officials said that more than 1,000 unresolved grievances were outstanding before negotiations got under way, and that the company had violated existing agreements by forcing workers to handle jobs outside their classification, and by refusing to honor seniority agreements allowing laid off workers from one Pontiac truck plant to transfer to another.    But their complaints clearly extended beyond those specific concerns, and many workers took the chance to air general complaints against the corporation that have been building up in recent months. Those include the failure of the negotiated profit-sharing formula to yield any payments for hourly workers, the company's decision to pay executive bonuses, and allegations that the company is pitting local unions against each other for work.    Several strikers toted picket signs reading, &quot;Enough is Enough. No More Give-Aways. No More Take-Aways.&quot; The detailed grievances were only &quot;the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said assembly worker Al Mason. &quot;We're on strike to maintain our standard of living. GM just wants us to give up more and more.&quot;    GM's announcement that it would temporarily close its Fiero plant came as each of the Big Three domestic auto makers released weekly production schedules. GM said its production this week increased 27% from the like week last year, while Ford Motor Co. reported a 37% increase and Chrysler Corp. a 13% decline.    Chrysler said recent production declines are related to the closing of a number of plants for conversion. As previously announced, the company's Belvidere, Ill., car assembly plant is closed for an 18-week plant conversion. About 2,800 hourly workers are on temporary layoff as a result of the closing, Chrysler said.    The U.S. auto industry expects to build 167,066 cars this week, down 2.4% from 171,144 cars last week and up 25% from 133,324 cars assembled in the year-ago week.    GM said it scheduled its Fairfax, Kan., car assembly plant for overtime tomorrow. Ford said it scheduled its Lorain, Ohio, car assembly plant and its Norfolk, Va., and Twin Cities, Minn., truck operations for overtime tomorrow. Chrysler said it scheduled its Jefferson Ave. assembly plant in Detroit for two overtime shifts tomorrow.    ---            This     Last  Yr.
