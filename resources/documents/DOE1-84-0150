<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0150 </DOCNO><TEXT>Previously developed methods for the treatment of polyhedral boranes,carboranes, and metal clusters are extended to the treatment of goldclusters, which present a variety of new problems. In most cases goldatoms in such cluster compounds do not employ the usual 9-orbital sp/sup3/d/sup 5/ spherical bonding orbital manifold. Instead almost all non-tetrahedralgold clusters consist of a center gold atom surrounded by a puckeredpolygonal belt of peripheral gold atoms generally with one or more additionalperipheral gold atoms in distal positions above and/or below the belt.The peripheral gold atoms in such clusters use a 7-orbital spd/sup 5/cylindrical bonding orbital manifold, but their residual two orthogonalantibonding p orbitals of adjacent peripheral gold atoms through d{sigma}-andgt;p{sigma}*and/or d{pi}-andgt;p{pi}* backbonding leading to bonding distances betweenadjacent peripheral gold atoms. The topology of the core bonding in goldclusters is generally not that of the K/sub n/ complete graph found inother clusters but instead mimics the topology of the polyhedron formedby the surface atoms. This apparently is a consequence of the poor lateraloverlap of the cylindrical spd/sup 5/ manifolds of the peripheral goldatoms.</TEXT></DOC>
