L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181,4527) requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue, by December 31,1990, regulations establishing, for purposes of section 12007 and 12009of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, minimum uniform standardsfor a biometric identification system applying to operators of CMVs. Thepurpose of this system would be to provide positive identification of driversin the CDLIS and a constraint against drivers' obtaining more than oneCDL.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>A variety of factors contribute to accident causation, including the highway,the environment, the vehicle and the driver. The Commercial Motor VehicleSafety Act of 1986 (Title XII of Pub. L. 99-570) (CMVSA) was enacted toremove unsafe and unqualified commercial drivers from the nation's highways.This will be done by making it illegal for drivers to have more than onelicense; by establishing uniform standards which will be used by the Statesto issue a CDL; by ensuring that a driver possesses the knowledge and skillsnecessary to safely operate the type of vehicle he or she drives; by establishingstandards based on convictions for which CMV operators will be disqualified;and instituting a reporting system to ensure that all such convictionsare reported to the driver's State and included on his/her driver's record.To assure ``one license-one record'' for each driver, the CMVSA also directedthe Secretary to establish an information system which would serve as aclearinghouse and depository of information pertaining to the licensingand identification of operators of CMVs and the disqualification of suchoperators from operating CMVs. The clearninghouse, CDLIS, contains theidentification information on CMV drivers and identifies the State whichissued the license and where the driver's record is retained. CDLIS isconnected to a telecommunication system, AAMVAnet, operated by AAMVAnet,Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of American Association of Motor VehicleAdministrators (AAMVA). AAMVAnet, which connects the States to the CDLISand each other, is designed to facilitate the timely exchange of informationon commercial drivers among the States.Section 12007 of the CMVSA provides that the CDLIS shall, at a minimum,include the following information concerning each operator of a commercialmotor vehicle:(1) Information the Secretary considers appropriate to ensure identificationof such operator;(2) The name and address of such operator and a physical description ofsuch operator;(3) The social security number (SSN) of such operator or such other numberor information as the Secretary determines appropriate to identify suchoperator;(4) The name of the State which issued the driver's license to such operator;(5) The dates between which such license is valid; and(6) Whether or not such operator has or has had a driver's license whichauthorized such person to operate a commercial motor vehicle suspended,revoked, or canceled by a State, has lost the right to operate a CMV ina State for any period, or has been disqualified from operating a CMV.The CDLIS, which became operational in January, 1989, provides an inquiringState with the ability to check if a person already has a CDL before issuinga commercial license to that applicant. The CDLIS is actually a ``pointersystem'' which employs a matching procedure to determine if an applicantwas ever issued a CDL and, if so, then points to the State which issuedit. The actual driver's record can then be sent (electronically) to theinquiring State. Each State retains both the right to issue and administerthe commercial driver's licenses held by its residents and the responsibilityto maintain the driver record associated with each licensed driver. Statesare required to report non-resident convictions to the State of residence.The driver record information is available to other States.Currently, a cluster of personal and descriptive data is being used asthe identifier. The items included in this cluster are: name, date of birth,sex, height, weight, eye color, social security number, and license numberwith State of issuance.A variety of procedures are used to manipulate identifying information,including name reduction via a soundex-type equivalent, substitution ofnicknames, deviations on birth dates, deviations on SSN, etc. The processresults in a probability of identification. At the completion of the procedures,if the probability of an identification remains above a specified threshold,this probable match is reported to the inquirer. If multiple possible matchesare found, they are also returned to the inquirer for evaluation.Because identifying information includes the license number and the Statethat issued the license for each name and alias, it is possible to quicklyverify whether the person holding the license appears to be the one towhom it was issued. Very few people will be able to avoid identification(e.g. to use a false identity) by the procedures that are in place. Ifa false identity is created in order to obtain multiple licenses, it islikely that fraud has been committed.Because the CDLIS design was developed in parallel with the FHWA's noticeof proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on the Commercial Driver Testing and LicensingStandards, published at 52 FR 47326 on December 11, 1987, the broader clusterof identifiers described above had not been adopted at the time the NPRMwas published. Consequently, the NPRM addressed only a SSN as the uniqueidentifier. Among the questions raised in that NPRM [FHWA Docket No. MC-87-18],on CDL documentation was ``although FHWA's proposal uses the social securitynumber as the number to identify CMV operators, the FHWA recognizes thatthere are several new and developing technologies that could be used touniquely identify each CMV operator.* * * Should any of these technologiesbe required as part of the standard?'' The response to this question wasvaried. Most of the States that responded requested that further studyof relevant technologies be undertaken. These States favored further studyleading toward adoption of a system and a phase-in period at a later date,after the initial CDL system is fully operational. Some states noted thatsystems currently are very expensive; the field is advancing very fast;and technology is quickly obsolete. The associations and private companiesthat responded were more evenly divided between further study and immediateadoption of a more sophisticated technology. The American Trucking Associations(ATA) proposed the early adoption of the retinal scan as the identifier.The ATA alleged that the social security number is unsatisfactory as anidentifier since it is relatively easy to obtain fraudulent social securitynumbers. It claimed that retinal image data could be stored on a magneticstrip on the CDL, ensuring roadside positive identification of drivers.Since passage of the CMVSA, the FHWA, along with its contractors, AAMVAand California, has proceeded to study this issue in a methodical manner.In 1987, the Orkand Corporation, as part of a broader effort, evaluatedbiometric identifiers. The Orkand Corporation report, entitled ``FunctionalDescription for a Unique Identification System for the Commercial Driver'sLicense Information System'' was delivered in February 1988. In December,1988, the State of California, Department of Motor Vehicles (CDMV), inconjunction with a Committee of States, finalized an FHWA funded ``FeasibilityStudy Report'' on biometric identifiers. These reports have been placedin the public docket and are available for review. They are summarizedlater in this document.In recent legislation, the Congress further recognized the importance ofthe positive identification of drivers and required standards for a biometricidentifier. Section 9105 of the Truck and Bus Safety and Regulatory ReformAct of 1988 requires that the Secretary shall:(a) Issue regulations by December 31, 1990, that establish minimum uniformstandards for a biometric identification system to ensure identificationof operators of commercial motor vehicles.(b) Carry out a pilot project to demonstrate the use of such biometricidentification systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Results of Prior Studies</ITAG>The Orkand Corporation reported on issues associated with biometric technology.It examined retinal image, fingerprint, hand geometry, voice, and signaturebiometirc technologies, and the appropriatneess of using biometric identificationwithin the commercial driver licensing environment. The report evaluatedeach of these biometrics against the following three principal requirementswhich Orkand believed, based on its research, to be necessary for any identificationtechnology used in a commercial driver licensing environment. The Reportstates that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) the system must be capable of performing both enrollment and verificationfunctions; (During enrollment the biometric database is searched for duplicaterecords; during verification, the current biometric identify record iscompared to the previously stored biometric enrollment records.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) the system must be capable of performing these functions for largedata bases; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) the system must be able to monitor identifier recording processes.(The identifiers under consideration rely on consistent measurement orreading of the characteristics being captured. In order to assure thatgood data is captured, the system must permit monitoring by driver's licensingpersonnel.)</ITAG>The report concluded that two biometric technologies_retinal scanning andautomatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS)_should be consideredto identify commercial drivers because these two technologies are the onlybiometric identifiers that met the principal criteria. Retinal scanningmeasures the light and dark areas caused by blood vessel patterns in theeye. AFIS uses minutiae (fingerprint ridge characteristics) matching technology,an image system and a networking capability to access data bases. Also,the report recommends careful testing of biometric systems both in controlledand demonstration environments prior to considering a full-scale implementationprogram.The CDMV then proceeded to determine the feasibility of biometric identifiertechnology in the driver licensing environment. The CDMV Feasibility StudyReport recommends that both retinal scan and AFIS technologies be testedwithin a driver licensing environment to determine which technology bestsatisfies the national CDL program effort and the one-license provisionof CMVSA.The CDMV report identified an initial set of functional requirements thatshould be satisfied by the system design of any biometric identifier systemin order to be feasible for commercial driver licensing. These are:1. The system must capture the biometric identifier from each applicantwithout increasing the net transaction processing time (the actual timea customer is in a DMV office).2. The biometric identifier must be an accurate, relatively unalterable,unique, physical characteristic that can be captured, recognized or verifiedand stored and that is verifiable over an indefinite period of time.3. The method of capturing the biometric identifier must be unobtrusiveto the applicant. The method must be socially acceptable and not endangerthe health, safety, or welfare of any applicant.4. The system of capturing, recognizing or verifying and storing each applicant'sbiometric record must have been previously tested for accuracy in an environmentthat proximates that of the CDLIS with an acceptable error rate.5. The system must be able to search and compare new biometric identifiersagainst stored records. The system must also be capable of performing verificationson previously established biometric records. The recognition process mustbe accomplished within an acceptable amount of elapsed time after receiptof the inquiry, and verification processes must be accomplished withina very short time from the receipt of the inquiry.6. During the initial enrollment process (conversion) for previously licensedcommercial drivers, the biometric data base file will grow from zero recordsto 5 million records. Therefore, during the conversion, the system mustbe capable of searching and comparing the 5 million current records andthe 500,000 new CDLs issued each year against this growing data base. Oncethe biometric records on existing commercial drivers have been captured,compared and stored, the system must be capable of annually recording,comparing, and storing 500,000 new CDL applicants' biometric records. Thesystem must also be capable of annually verifying the biometric recordson 1.25 million CDL renewal applicants, 250,000 interstate residency changeapplicants and 90,000 applicants seeking duplicate (replacement) licensesand the anticipated 5% a year growth in these types of applications.7. The system must have a method of capturing, storing, and reporting managementinformation, such as the number of new biometric records accepted, thenumber of biometric records verified, the number of applicants the systemwas unable to ``enroll,'' measurements of the quality of the informationcaptured, system down time, the system errors by type, and average enrollmentprocessing time on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.8. The system must be compatible with and capable of interfacing with CDLISdesigned pursuant to the CMVSA. 9. The system must be reliable, allowing the states to provide uninterruptedservice to their applicants. 10. Any biometric identifier capturing device must provide on-site, immediateidentification of whether or not an acceptable biometric sample has beenobtained, thereby guarding against the need for customers to make returnvisits to the local offices solely to recapture their biometric record.11. The system must be simple to use. Use of the system must be easilyunderstood by employees and must be easy to explain to the states' customerswhether they are English or non-English speaking.12. In order to encourage maximum biometric system participation by thestates, the system should offer sufficient flexibility in procurement optionsand the capture and transmission of the biometric data.13. The system must be capable of accurately accomplishing proper identificationwithout a candidate list for virtually all of the applications.14. The system must be capable of interfacing with other biometric identifiersystems using the same type of biometric and meeting standards of dataexchange recognized by the AAMVA now or in the future for the biometricidentifier captured. If the biometric identifier is an automated fingerprint,the interface must meet American National Standards Institute (formerlythe National Bureau of Standards) standards.15. The verification template/minutiae must be capable of being incorporatedon a data carrier card issued in the form of a driver's license.16. The system must have the potential for remote verification when usedwith a data carrier license document.As provided by the Truck and Bus Safety and Regulatory Reform Act of 1988,the FHWA intends to carry out a pilot project to demonstrate and studythe use of biometric identification systems for ensuring identificationof operators of CMVs. As recommended in the Feasibility Study Report, bothretinal scan and AFIS technologies will be tested by the FHWA in the pilotstudy within a driver licensing environment to determine which technologybest satisfies the national CDL program effort and the one-license provisionof the CMVSA. Both technologies will be assessed to determine the abilityof each to meet the requirements outlined in the Feasibility Study Report.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking </ITAG>The FHWA expects to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking based on thecomments on this advance notice of proposed rulemaking and results fromthe pilot demonstration project. The pilot demonstration project is expectedto be completed by December 1989. The requirements outlined in the FeasibilityStudy Report which relate to uniqueness, accuracy, versatility, reliability,flexibility, processing time, and public acceptability will be thoroughlystudied. Costs and related benefits will also be assessed. We expect thenotice of proposed rulemaking to be issued in early 1990 and the finalrule by the end of that year as required by the Truck and Bus Safety Actand Regulatory Reform of 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues and Questions for Comment</ITAG>In order to more fully understand the various issues relating to this topicand to develop a proposal as required by the 1988 Act, the FHWA is solicitingcomments on the following questions, as well as any additional issues identifiedby respondents.Costs and benefitsAlthough some drivers maintained multiple drivers licenses before July1, 1987, when this practice was not clearly prohibited by Federal regulationsor by all of the States, it is unknown how many drivers continue to possessmultiple licenses. It is even more unclear how many would take the considerableadditional steps required to create a false identity in order to circumventthe law once all CDL holders are registered in one central clearinghouse.In order to understand the scope of the current problem or the problemas it may exist in the future, any information possessed by the industry,the States, professional organizations, or the general public is requested.(1) How many drivers currently operate in defiance of the law?(2) Also, how extensive will this problem be when the program is fullyimplemented and all CDL holders are entered into the CDLIS?(3) On what basis are the above estimates of the size of the problem made?(4) What alternatives besides the biometric identifier can be used to reduceor eliminate the problem?(5) Since the CDLIS supports a broad comparison of identifying information,does internal comparison of individual identification records, in conjunctionwith severe penalties, provide ample reason for drivers not to seek multiplelicenses?The pilot demonstration project will assess two technologies: retinal scanand AFIS. The FHWA needs information concerning costs and benefits foreach of these systems. The FHWA realizes that the pilot will help developsome of this information, but seeks input on other related experience.(6) How much will such a system cost in terms of hardware, software, personnel,training, and impacts on existing state licensing procedures? Please specifyby each office where the equipment is located and for the entire State.(7) What factors are most likely to increase costs of the system?(8) What are the costs likely to be for making the system mandatory forall states as opposed to making it optional?(9) What are the benefits likely to be?(a) In terms of money?(b) In terms of ``non-monetary'' or social benefits?(10) How much would each State be willing to pay each year for such a system?(a) In terms of additional AAMVAnet costs.(b) In terms of within State costs.(c) Both of these.(11) How much could each licensee be assessed for such a system and howwould this relate to total costs?(12) What is a tolerable error rate for both erroneously identifying amatch when there is not one and not identifying a match that should actuallybe one?(13) How much additional time for conducting the match search is consideredacceptable? This process may delay issuance of a license.(14) Under what conditions would it be acceptable to issue temporary licenses?(15) What are the acceptable added costs (per license), assuming limitedand widespread use?(16) What benefits would be achieved in having the biometric informationavailable on the CDL in a form that could be read electronically?Mandatory versus optionalThe Truck and Bus Safety and Regulatory Reform Act of 1988 requires thatminimum uniform standards for a biometric identification system be establishedfor purposes of sections 12007 and 12009 of the CMVSA.(17) Should the establishment of such a system be made mandatory for allStates?(18) If so, when should such a standard be mandated?Privacy(19) Are there privacy issues involved?(20) Would there be any privacy distinctions between an AFIS and the retinalscan?(21) If problems are noted, what modifications would alleviate these?(22) Who should have access to this data and for what purpose?Market considerationsCurrently, there is only one vendor marketing retinal scan technology andonly a limited number marketing automatic fingerprint identification systemstechnology, which cannot currently exchange data from one vendor's systemto another's at an acceptable level of detail.(23) Is there vendor support to accommodate nationwide implementation andprojected growth?(24) Should the FHWA merely specify performance parameters and leave vendorsto develop requisite systems, or should the selection be restricted toexisting system designs?<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291. However, because of the public interest incommercial motor vehicle safety, this notice is considered significantunder the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT. For this reasonand pursuant to Executive Order 12498, this rulemaking action has beenincluded on the Regulatory Program for significant rulemaking actions.The economic impacts of this rulemaking that will occur are mandated bythe statutory provisions themselves. For this reason, a full regulatoryevaluation will not be required. However, commenters should provide anycost/benefit data that they believe relevant.Based upon information available to the FHWA at this time, this action,if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.Federalism Assessment StatementThe FHWA will review this action in light of the purposes of the Truckand Bus Safety and Regulatory Reform Act of 1988 and requests commentson ways to reduce the paperwork burden. Nothing in this document directlypreempts any State law or regulation. It is certified that the policiescontained in this document have been assessed in light of the principles,criteria, and requirements of the Federalism Executive Order 12612 (October26, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 383</ITAG>Commercial driver's license standards requirements and penalties, Highwayand roads, Motor vehicle safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217 MotorCarrier Safety).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 9105 of Pub.
