Up ahead, a flickering light in a doorway betrays a trio of shadowy figures. Crack smokers.    Suddenly, Mr. Sullivan bolts forward, shouting. &quot;Haven't we {obscenity} told you often enough? You don't smoke around here.&quot; Startled, one of the figures raises his hands, apparently fearing arrest. A dark object clangs to the ground. Mr. Sullivan scoops up a knife with a four-inch blade. The men move on.    The slightly built 27-year-old is no cop, however. He is a playwright and carpenter. Despite his boldness, he isn't armed either -- except with enormous anger and an abiding dislike for drug users and dealers. Yet he, Mr. Droser and others like them have become symbols of safety and order in their neighborhood these days.    They are members of Thirteen Resolved to Evict All Dealers, or Thread, a citizens' patrol named after its single-minded aim of purging drug traffic from 13th Street near the East River. As crack raced through America last year, 13th Street became a big crack &quot;supermarket,&quot; recalls Harry Saltzman, a resident of 17 years. Now, because of Thread's activities, at least &quot;we can go out without being accosted,&quot; he says.    Neighborhood patrols are nothing new, of course. They have come and gone over the years as proposed remedies for various crimes, most often as a guard against burglaries. The theory is that citizens can be eyes and ears for the police, leading to more arrests and eventually reducing whatever crime is being targeted.    But new groups like Thread are tossing out the squeaky-clean, Boy Scout approach as they try to clear their streets of rampant drug trafficking, especially crack sellers and smokers.    Observation and calls to the police are passe. Patrol members are aggressive -- sometimes even nasty and abusive. Modeling themselves in part after New York's controversial Guardian Angels, who earned a reputation years ago battling subway muggers, they don't concentrate on having wrong-doers arrested. They disavow violence, but have just one objective -- send the drug crowd packing by any means they can.    Because such programs are confrontational, and not too concerned with due process or the niceties of Constitutional freedoms, they are under increasing fire. &quot;These groups are essentially vigilante groups. They are taking the law into their own hands, and whether they mean to or not, they violate it,&quot; contends Richard Emery, a civil-rights attorney formerly with the New York Civil Liberties Union. &quot;Confrontations by citizens, even when organized, are a mistake. They may result in violence that otherwise would not occur.&quot;    Critics also question any program that makes no effort to solve problems, only to move them elsewhere.    Still, largely out of their frustration over the crack crisis, activist neighborhood patrols soldier on. In Washington, Nation of Islam members garbed in dark dress suits and bow ties are widely credited with expelling dope dealers from low-income housing projects where drug-related shootings once were common. Here in the East Village, though drug-fighters don't harbor any illusions, there are also small signs of success. &quot;We run them away and they come back,&quot; says Mr. Saltzman. &quot;But it's much, much less.&quot;    Before Thread hit the streets last August, dope traffic &quot;took over our lives. It began to drag us into it,&quot; says Richard Behar, the 27-year-old magazine writer who founded the group. There were fights and shootings; open solicitations and junkies in doorways. Residents of this polyglot neighborhood of artisans, climbing professionals, young Hispanics and black and white shopkeepers were dismayed.    &quot;Last summer was horrible,&quot; says Loris Crawford, who sells art at the Savacou Gallery on 13th Street. &quot;They had taken over the block from one end to the other. You could see them in every doorway, every opening, selling, smoking crack. It had gotten kind of scary.&quot;    James Jones, a building superintendent on the block for 13 years, recalls smokers under stoops, prostitutes and a drug-related shootout. To discourage dealers from using his front steps as a regular resting spot, he kept the stoop soaked with water. &quot;You just put your tail between your legs and they'll run all over you,&quot; he warns. &quot;I'm not that kind.&quot;    But it takes a lot to battle crack peddlers and users. Two weekends on the street here reveal both the benefits and shortcomings of the patrol -- a bittersweet blend of frustration and satisfaction, hope and hopelessness, justice and unfairness.    At about 11:30 p.m. each Friday and Saturday, the war of nerves begins. Until about four the next morning, Thread teams in &quot;crack patrol&quot; T-shirts go about the business of spotting, harassing and chasing off drug dealers and users from around 13th Street and Third Avenue.    Driving crack smokers away mostly involves studied intimidation. There are risks, but sometimes the target ends up more pathetic than threatening. A chief tactic is to smash the smoker's stem -- a cylindrical, pipe-like device without a bowl used to smoke the cocaine derivative -- and to browbeat the offender into moving on.    &quot;We're sick and tired of you {obscenity} drug dealers,&quot; yells Mr. Droser, a 33-year-old hospital planner, lunging for one smoker's stem. His target -- a tall, thin man -- wants no trouble, but won't release his stem. &quot;I'm not no drug dealer. I'm a drug fiend,&quot; he protests as if the distinction would somehow win him relief from this intrusion. &quot;I'm a dope addict.&quot;    Sensing that he has the upper hand, Mr. Droser presses on at the top of his voice. &quot;We don't want drug addicts on this block. . . . Drop the stem,&quot; he bellows. Again he tries to force the stem from the smoker's hand.    &quot;Get off me please,&quot; the junkie pleads. &quot;I'm walking away, sir. I'm walking away from you, sir. Please, this is something I got to do, sir.&quot; As usually happens, the smoker leaves; longer confrontations are rare, patrol members say.    The idea is to &quot;yell and scream, make a scene&quot; so that pushers and junkies feel doing business on 13th Street isn't worth the risk, Mr. Droser explains. &quot;You want to scare them and intimidate them.&quot; Attention is the last thing they want, he says.    Thread doesn't specifically train new members; the tough-guy act seems to come naturally from the anger neighborhood residents feel, he says. &quot;You literally channel all that anger&quot; toward the individual being confronted, he explains. In return, there is a feeling of &quot;taking back the neighborhood.&quot;    On a typical night, two patrols of at least three Thread members each join up with some Guardian Angels, readily identifiable in their red berets. The Guardian Angels -- a nine-year-old organization that is visible and controversial in a number of cities around the country -- coached some Thread members in street tactics in the beginning. They still play a supporting role and maintain two-way radio links with the group. But Thread leaders make their own decisions on patroling.    It turns out to be a radio call from a group of Guardian Angels a block away that illustrates the distrust on the street between the patrols and police. The Angels have cornered a man they say was selling drugs. They pin him to a car, then against a wall as police are called. Three &quot;dime&quot; ($10) bags of marijuana and two $10 bills lie on the sidewalk.    The man breaks away across a busy, rain-slicked intersection. He is finally tackled and held down by a beefy Angel kneeling on his back. When two police cars roll up, a sergeant turns to the Angel: &quot;You might be the one who gets busted.&quot;    What bothers police about such actions, says Jerald Vaughn, executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, is that they represent &quot;a breakdown of the rule of law.&quot; He maintains, &quot;It's only a matter of time before these groups step over the line. &quot; They may begin rousting others they dislike -- people &quot;who are not the right skin color or the right religious persuasion,&quot; he says. Also, &quot;when a group of people decide to abandon traditional law enforcement, you always run the risk of violence.&quot;    Patrols do take some risks, especially when they mimic police and try to make undercover buys, with all the bluffing and tension that implies. One such purchase attempt begins as Mr. Sullivan, the playwright, meets a spindly, bearded man with shifty eyes walking along 14th Street. The man mumbles something about crack. Mr. Sullivan stops to talk. Another patroller nonchalantly eases by to check the situation. Others watch from behind trash dumpsters down the block.    &quot;Are you the police?&quot; the would-be dealer asks.    &quot;Do I look like the police?&quot; Mr. Sullivan replies as he presses the man to &quot;let me see&quot; the crack, a necessary ingredient in a citizen's arrest.    Suspicious, the man eyes Mr. Sullivan up and down, and says he hasn't any on him. He orders Mr. Sullivan to wait, and disappears into a suspected dope house across the street. Eventually he emerges and shakes his head. There will be no bust this time.    So far, patrol members here haven't confronted the drug houses directly. But in Detroit, residents have demonstrated against dope houses, and in Miami a number of suspicious fires have broken out in suspected drug dens. The arson, says former Miami Fire Marshal Robert Rehr, comes from &quot;neighbors trying to rid the neighborhoods of this bad element.&quot;    Neighborhood support clearly keeps patrols stoked up. Many residents cheered out their windows last summer when Thread announced its formation by raising a big banner lettered &quot;Drug Dealers Get Out&quot; from apartment fire escapes across 13th Street. Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels' founder, contends citizen involvement merely marks a turn toward self-reliance; a realization that government and police can't meet every community need.    But residents aren't blindly supportive. Though most say they see improvement in the neighborhood, a few have misgivings. The most common complaint is that patrols do little more than move dealers to nearby streets.    Cornell Edwards, a plant merchant who has lived in the area for 20 years, even wonders if Thread members, most of whom are white professionals, have a hidden agenda: gentrification. The group addresses the nuisance of dope dealing, rather than the drug problem itself, says Mr. Edwards, who is black. &quot;What they object to is what goes on in the street, rather than what goes on.&quot;    Mr. Droser concedes the group merely shoves the problem away. &quot;It's totally parochially focused,&quot; he says. &quot;If it means another neighborhood has been impacted negatively, then maybe that neighborhood will get just as angry as we were.&quot;    Even Thread's founder, Mr. Behar, says the patrols aren't the best answer. Being on the street every Friday and Saturday night &quot;eats up a lot of leisure time,&quot; he says, and there's no sure end in sight. Yet, he has &quot;no regrets, even when our progress seems to be eradicated in one evening, because if you stop fighting, something inside of you dies.&quot;    So the fight goes on. &quot;I don't want to see you around the neighborhood, or I'm going to kick your ass,&quot; Jesus Feliciano, a Guardian Angel accompanying a Thread group, shouts at a short, wiry and bearded crack smoker sitting on a dingy stoop.    &quot;I smoke it and I'd tell the judge I smoke it,&quot; the man yells back. &quot;I ain't gonna stop smoking it.&quot; The argument heats up; horns blare as drivers slow to watch the commotion. Finally, apparently feeling justified, the crack smoker gets up. &quot;Now I'm gonna try to stay out of your way. . . . If you catch me, you catch me. I'll move from here.&quot;    Precisely the idea, of course. </TEXT></DOC>
