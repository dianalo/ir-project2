SGEP'sseven county-based marine advisors and three statewide specialists useapplied research, demonstrations, workshops, publications, mass media,and individual consultations to help the industry put research-basedinformation to work. SGEP has worked with the fishing industry for fifteenyears. Two major ongoing long-term problems of the fishing industry havebeen chronically low-income levels and full- or over-exploitation offish stocks. These problems were especially severe during the first halfof the 1980s.
