In the vicinity of Titinose-bridge, maximum velocityappeared and high efficiency of current turbin could be expected, withoutgiving any trouble to fishing boat traffic. However, it was noticed thata lot of sea animals adhered to the turbine might cause troubles to theoperation of it. As the result of corrosion test, SUS-316 stainless steelwas recommended from the view points of unti-corrosion and economics.By economical calculation, it was concluded that, sea stream pump costedabout 6 times compared with the cost driven by electric motor.
