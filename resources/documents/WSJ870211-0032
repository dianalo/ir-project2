The redeployment will reduce Eastern's fleet of Airbus A-300s to 28 from 34, while doubling Continental's to 12. Eastern said only that the sale between subsidiaries will help &quot;rationalize&quot; the mix of wide and narrow-body aircraft in each unit.    But analysts said the switch will also escalate Texas Air's efforts to extract labor-cost concessions from unionized workers at Eastern. &quot;There is some economic logic in moving those planes, but it is also the beginning of the chess game,&quot; said Raymond Neidl, airline analyst for McCarthy Crisanti andamp; Maffei.    The announcement appeared to make good a threat by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, that Eastern planes and routes could be sold to Continental unless Eastern's labor costs are reduced. Last month, Eastern President Phil Bakes said the company expects employees to accept wages reduced an average of 29%. Eastern's labor costs are among the highest in the industry. Eastern's unions, however, have vowed not to reopen their current labor contracts.    Union officials didn't immediately return phone calls. But Robert Callahan, who until last week was president of Eastern's flight attendants union, said the unions will almost certainly sue Eastern to prevent the transfer of the planes.    The unions' legal leverage, he said, is an issue of Eastern preferred stock owned by employees, which may give them standing as shareholders to block the transfer of assets. By hanging on to the stock -- despite Mr. Lorenzo's repeated offers to acquire it -- the unions are in a good position to fight without being drawn into a costly strike, said Mr. Callahan.    &quot;We can go to the courts, rather than the streets,&quot; he said.    Wall Street analysts, however, are uncertain about the measure of clout that the stock ownership grants the unions. &quot;If they think it will work, this is a perfect opportunity for them to prove it,&quot; said Robert Joedicke, airlines analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Eastern executives met for about an hour last week with leaders of the flight attendants and pilots unions. But although ground rules for future talks were discussed, the unions remained adamant that they wouldn't reopen their contracts. No dates for future meetings were set.    A consultant to the militant machinists union viewed Texas Air's announcement as a means of provoking the union. Already, outside mechanics are servicing Eastern's new Boeing 757 jets, which represented 300 potential jobs lost, the machinists say.    Moreover, the consultant said, low-cost Continental lacks the number of trained personnel required to maintain the highly sophisticated aircraft. &quot;I'll be really interested to see how he (Mr. Lorenzo) can maintain them,&quot; he said.    The Airbuses aren't the first Eastern assets to be redeployed to Continental. Recently, Texas Air eliminated Eastern routes that Continental planes have begun flying, including service to Ottawa and Mexico City, and service between New York's LaGuardia Airport and New Orleans.    Analysts questioned whether the transfer of A-300s indicated that Eastern might be preparing to scale back its Moonlight Express, a highly successful service on no-frills late-night flights aboard cargo planes. Currently about 17 Moonlight Express flights depart Houston nightly, and most are on the wide-body A-300s.    This speculation was further fueled by the scheduled expiration March 2 of Eastern's contract with Consolidated Airfreight, which has exclusive rights to the cargo space. An Eastern executive said, however, that the airline intends to continue contracting out the cargo bays, although with multiple users.    Beyond that, analysts predicted that Continental would make good use of the newly transferred wide-body aircraft on such widely traveled routes as New York to Chicago and Houston to Chicago. &quot;Continental is growing, and these planes make perfect sense on those routes,&quot; said Mr. Neidl.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
