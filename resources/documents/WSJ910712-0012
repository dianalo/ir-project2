Typically, hotels, airports, hospitals and otherorganizations sign up a long-distance carrier to provide payphones on their premises in exchange for a commission onrevenues from the phones. In the past, many of the designatedlong-distance companies have blocked callers' access tocompeting carriers.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday the Federal Communications Commission ruled thatthe phones must be unblocked within six months, allowingcallers to dial codes to reach the carrier of their choice.For example, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s code is10288; MCI Communications Corp. uses 10222; and US Sprintuses 10333. In addition, long-distance carriers must set up800 or 950 numbers that customers can use to reach theirnetworks.   The FCC also decided that pay-phone providers are entitledto compensation for calls consumers place using access codesand asked for public comment on appropriate payments.   Separately, the commission adopted a national standard forphone companies to provide service for people with hearingand speech disabilities. The new rules, which carry outrequirements of last year's Americans with Disabilities Act,allow people with disabilities to communicate with a hearingperson by typing messages to an operator, who would then readthem to the hearing person. The rules eliminate the need forboth parties to have special equipment to send and receivemessages.</TEXT></DOC>
