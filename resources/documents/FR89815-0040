Fleishman, Office of NuclearRegulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC20555, telephone (301) 492-3794.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On May 30, 1986, the NRC publishedan advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) (51 FR 19561) to solicitpublic comments on a Commission proposal to increase the current levelof engineering expertise on shift, and to ensure that senior operatorshave operating experience on a commercial nuclear reactor operating atgreater than twenty percent power. Two hundred letters were received inresponse to the ANRP; most of them were opposed to a degree requirementfor senior operators.Although comments received on the ANPR were generally opposed to a degreerequirement, the Commission believed that it would be beneficial to obtainadditional public comment on two alternative amendments to its regulations.The proposed rule_Education and Experience Requirements for Senior ReactorOperators and Supervisors at Nuclear Power Plants_was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 29, 1988 (53 FR 52716) for a 60 daypublic comment period, which was later extended to March 29, 1989. Thealternatives proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice would have imposed additional educationand experience requirements for either senior operators (Alternative 1)or contol room shift supervisors \1\<NOTE/> (Alternative 2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The term ``shift supervisor'' is being used to refer tothat person holding a senior operator license for all fueled units at thesite who is assigned responsibility for overall plant operation at alltimes there is fuel in any unit. When a single operator does not hold asenior operator license on all fueled units at the site, a licensee musthave at the site two or more senior operators, who in combination are licensedas senior operators on all fueled units. A total of 25 comment letters were received on the proposed rule. All ofthe comments have been reviewed and evaluated. (Copies of the comment lettersare available for public inspection and copying for a fee at the NRC PublicDocument Room at 2120 L Street NW., Lower Level, Washington, DC). Of the<T3>250</T3> comments received, <T3>244</T3> (approximately 98 percent) were from people who are part ofor associated with the regulated industry. Of the remaining six comments,five came from people associated with educational institutions and onecame from a citizen's group. A total of 237 commenters (approximately 95percent), were opposed to both Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 of the proposedrule. While no utilities favored the rule, about ten commenters, who eitherindicated that they were or appeared to be operators, were in favor ofone or both alternatives. The educational groups generally offered commentsregarding implementation of the proposed alternatives and were dividedon whether or not the rule should be made effective. The citizen's grouppreferred Alternative 2 to Alternative 1 and also believed that an NRCadministered examination should be used to measure the qualifications ofthe shift supervisors and ensure uniform standards in the industry. Because of the comments received on the proposed rule, the progress beingmade by utilities to voluntarily obtain engineering expertise on shift,and INPO initiatives both to increase professionalism of the operatingstaff and to review the adequacy of training and education requirementsfor shift supervisors, the Commission has concluded that it should withdrawthe proposed rule published December 29, 1988. We have included below a summary of comments that provides a general descriptionof the type and tone of comments received. This summary describes the mostprevalent comments as well as some comments that present unusual insights.The comments and responses to them are as follows: 1. <T3>Comment:</T3> Every organization that has studied the issue has concludedthat there is no valid reason for a degree requirement_these include theNRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), the NRC Committeeto Review Generic Requirements, the Reactor Operator Qualifications PeerReview Panel, the American Nuclear Society, the Institute of Nuclear PowerOperations (INPO), the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, Inc.,the Professional Reactor Operator Society and the National Research Councilof the National Academy of Sciences. There is no evidence to indicate thatan operator with a degree would perform better than one without a degreeduring either normal or abnormal situations. <T3>Response:</T3> While the Commission has concluded that it is unnecessaryto mandate specific degree requirements for senior operators or shift supervisors,we continue to believe the presence of individuals with a degree in thecontrol room is beneficial to safe operations. The question is not whetheran operator with a degree performs better than one without a degree. Instead,the question is whether, under unanticipated circumstances, a group ofoperators, as a team, would perform better if some of them had technicaland academic knowledge provided by a college degree. We are not aware ofany relevant technical data that could answer this question. However, mostorganizations acknowledged a need for ``engineering knowledge'' on shift.The Commission believes that the safety of commercial power reactors isenhanced by having on each shift a team of NRC-licensed professionals thatcombine technical and academic knowledge with plant-specific training andsubstantial hands-on operating experience. 2. <T3>Comment:</T3> There have been many improvements in design, organization,procedures, and operator training since the Three Mile Island (TMI) accidentso that the rule is not needed. <T3>Response:</T3> There have been many improvements in design, organization,and procedures since the TMI accident but these do not alleviate the needfor high quality technical knowledge on the operating shift. However, wehave withdrawn the rulemaking in favor of a policy statement. 3. <T3>Comments:</T3> (A) The ability to deal with unanticipated situationsrequires site specific systems knowledge acquired through hands-on, sitespecific, experience and training. (B) Operators are already getting training in basic engineering principles,detailed nuclear design, and detailed knowledge of nuclear plant operations,as well as diagnostics and communications, and are generally well-preparedto deal with unexpected situations. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree that operators are getting required basic trainingand that site specific systems knowledge and hands-on operating experienceare necessary to deal with unanticipated situations. However, a good operatormust have the ability to assimilate and integrate knowledge of multiplesystems to assess the causes of events not covered in trainng sessionsand direct the appropriate response. We believe education in a technicaldiscipline can equip an operator with knowledge in scientific and engineeringfundamentals and can better prepare an operator to handle situations notcovered by training. 4. <T3>Comment:</T3> If the Commission believes that more knowledge is needed,such as might be obtained from a bachelor's degree program, the knowledgeshould be identified, the material should be incorporated into operatortraining programs, and the NRC should test operators for that knowledge.<T3>Response:</T3> The NRC staff is considering this comment with respectto operator training programs. However, although some specific areas forimproved training may be identified, education, as discussed above, shouldalso be emphasized. 5. <T3>Comment:</T3> The fundamentals exam, currently being considered forboth Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) and Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs),could be used as an initial step in reactor operator licensing. This exam,which could be oriented to nuclear operations and engineering fundamentals,would be more suitable than would an engineer-in-training (EIT) exam, professionalengineer (PE) license, or a bachelor's degree. <T3>Response:</T3> The effectiveness of the fundamentals exam in improvingthe level of operator training is still being assessed. The developmentof this exam is underway and we will continue to monitor its effectiveness.6. <T3>Comment:</T3> Nuclear Utilities Management and Review Committee (NUMARC)commented that the results of a survey they performed indicated that 72percent of the utilities report that they are already promoting operatorswithout degrees into management positions above the shift supervisor position.<T3>Response: </T3>This is very encouraging, and is one of the reasonswe have decided not to proceed with the rule. However, while utilitiesmay be promoting some operators without degrees into management positionsabove the shift supervisor position, e.g., maintenance manager, it is notyet clear that these operators are getting into all phases of upper management.The Commission believes that programs which encourage experienced nuclearprofessionals to obtain college degrees and personnel with degrees to obtaina senior operator license and hands-on operating experience create an importantsource of management talent for the industry. These individuals are morelikely to be selected for management positions and, because of their understandingof the unique operational problems associated with nuclear power plantoperation, are in a better position to enhance nuclear safety by fosteringa strong safety culture within their organization.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>It would be desirable to retain the independent assessmentcapability of the Shift Technical Advisor (STA). The STA provides a valuablecontribution to the operating staff and is effective because the STA isnot responsible for procedural matters during a transient.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree; however, we believe that there is also a benefitto be derived from having operations expertise and engineering knowledgein the same individual. In its policy statement on education for senioroperators and shift supervisors published elsewhere in this issue, theCommission reaffirms its position regarding the presence of an STA on shiftand reemphasizes its desire that all licensees move toward a dual rolesenior operator/shift technical advisor (SO/STA) position.8. <T3>Comments: </T3>(A) It would be very difficult for a worker on a rotatingshift to attend college on a part-time basis. Furthermore, programs accreditedby the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) are generallynot very accessible to operating plant personnel.(B) Ongoing on-site programs leading to a bachelor's degree in NuclearScience, that have been initiated by utilities in response to perceivedCommission desires, will be jeopardized since they are not ABET accredited.(C) The detailed requirements related to the ABET accredited degree aretoo prescriptive. A bachelor's degree in any scientific discipline froma regionally accredited program, plus a senior operator license with itsassociated site specific training in accident diagnostics and engineeringfundamentals, is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in engineering.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that it is very difficult to work full-timeon shift as an operator and obtain a college degree. Several utilitieshave been offering programs leading to a degree that accommodates shiftwork, but while many people have entered the programs, few have actuallycompleted the programs and obtained degrees. The Commission believes thatthese programs should be encouraged because the opportunity should be madeavailable for highly motivated individuals to overcome institutional barriersand obtain a degree; furthermore, the demands of shift work are not thesame at every utility. We continue to believe that it is important thedegrees obtained be from accredited institutions to provide confidenceconcerning the quality of the education and the value of the degree.9. <T3>Comment: </T3>The bachelor's degree requirement should include theapplied sciences along with engineering, engineering technology, and thephysical sciences.<T3>Response: </T3>Education is the important focus here. While many degreesmay be acceptable, certain degrees are preferred as providing better preparationfor operators. The policy statement indicates that degrees in physicalscience, engineering, or engineering technology are preferable.10. <T3>Comments: </T3>(A) Negotiated labor agreements with unions do not havea requirement for a senior operator to have a bachelor's degree. The unionsindicate that they would go to court to fight the requirement for a bachelor'sdegree since no need for the requirement has been demonstrated.(B) It will be difficult for people with degrees to get the required reactoroperator experience in some union plants since the reactor operator positionis filled by union people and people with degrees are generally not inthe union but are considered part of management.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not believe labor agreements or practices shouldlead to actions which would inhibit the career development of union ornon-union members or be a disincentive to continued safe operation of facilities.11. <T3>Comments: </T3>(A) The rule will reduce the career potential for operatorswithout degrees who now view the senior operator and shift supervisor positionsas a desirable, long term career objective. The rule imposition will resultin the hiring of people with degrees who generally view shift-work as aninterim step in their career. This will create a higher turnover rate anda resulting reduction in the overall experience level.(B) Training, education, and experience are not enough for a good operator;it is essential that operators remain highly motivated. This has been accomplishedby incentives for operators to progress through the various steps in theoperating organization. The proposed rule will disrupt this arrangement.<T3>Response: </T3>The Commission has decided not to adopt a rule requiringa degree. We believe that it is desirable for licensees to have in thecontrol room individuals with a mix of education, training and experiencein plant operations. Therefore, utilities should continue to develop reactoroperators and senior operators who have a significant amount of hands-onexperience. It is desirable to have senior operators on shift who haveprogressed through the various steps in the operating organization.12. <T3>Comment: </T3>Alternative 2 overlooks the fact that the shift supervisorhas many non-technical duties to perform during the early period followingan accident that precludes the shift supervisor from getting involved inthe technical aspects of the plant response.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that this is important and should not be overlooked.If the shift supervisor is the only person on shift with engineering expertise,then the licensee should take this into account in the assignment of shiftsupervisor responsibilities. We expect that this issue will also be addressedby Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) in the effort it has underwayto review the adequacy of training and education requirements for the shiftsupervisor position. The Commission intends to follow this effort closelyand will participate as appropriate to ensure successful closure of thisissue.13. <T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed requirement to serve as a reactor operatorfor one year would upset the common practice of having management personneltake the senior operator licensing exam. This practice is worthwhile sinceit brings operating expertise into management and engineering managersget to learn about a plant's details.<T3>Response: </T3>Because the Commission has decided not to adopt theproposed rule it will not impact the practice of allowing management personnelto become senior operators if these persons meet all NRC requirements forlicensing.The NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) also consideredthe proposed requirement for degrees and discussed it at several meetingsin 1986 and 1987. The ACRS again discussed the issue in 1989 in relationto the issuance of a policy statement as opposed to a rule. The ACRS stronglysupported the concept of having engineering expertise on each shift. However,the ACRS did not agree that requiring a degree for senior operators wasthe best approach, though it agreed that specific technical knowledge shouldbe required. The ACRS believed that, because of the concern about adverseeffects raised by many knowledgeable individuals, a proposed rule requiringdegrees for senior operators should be reconsidered. The ACRS supportedthe issuance of a policy statement regarding education for senior operatorsand shift supervisors.Many utilities have provided opportunities for members of their operatingstaff to further their education. INPO has developed, in cooperation withmany nuclear utilities, ``Principles for Enhancing Professionalism of NuclearPersonnel,'' dated March 1, 1989, which INPO encourage utilities to implement.These principles reflect much of the Commission's philosophy and are endorsedby the Commission in the policy statement. In addition, INPO has an effortunderway to review the adequacy of the training and education requirementsfor shift supervisors which the NRC is following with interest.In view of all of these considerations, the Commission has concluded thatit should not proceed with adoption of the rule. Therefore, the proposedrule is withdrawn.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 9th day of August, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
