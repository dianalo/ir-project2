 (Holograms are three-dimensional images created with lasertechnology.)andM;Many believe home computers won't achieve widespread popular acceptance untila reasonably priced multimedia computer -- a computer with the audio, videoand animation qualities of television -- is developed.andP;  Multimedia computers,which are used sparingly in large businesses, have costly CD-ROM disks withsignificant storage capacity limitations that inhibit extensive use.andP;  &quot;Withexpanded capacity, multimedia computers could become as popular as the VCR,&quot;said researcher Eung-Gi Paek.andM;Actually creating full-motion video -- graphic animation of at least 30frames per second -- requires more lasers than used in Bellcore's experiment.andO;However, Paek explained that full-motion video &quot;is obtainable&quot; with theaddition of more lasers.andP;  In the near future, Bellcore expects to build asimplified working experimental prototype that can retrieve brief full-motionvideo footage.andM;Scientists have long recognized that holography could lead to improvedcomputer and telecommunications systems.andP;  Gaining selective access tospecific data in a holographic memory system would greatly increase the speedwith which data stored in that system could be retrieved and applied to aparticular task, according to co-researcher John Wullert.andM;Typically, computers with hard disks assemble information line by line andonly in the original sequence.andP;  The user must wait until all of that data hasbeen processed before locating a specific item.andM;No one has been able to find a practical way to retrieve individual imagesfrom a hologram until now, because of the technical limitations of mostsystem architectures and devices, said co-researcher Ann Von Lehmen.andM;While prior attempts frequently used bulky lasers and unweildy lightdeflectors, Bellcore's novel approach takes advantage of recent advancementsin harnessing the power of the world's smallest lasers (invented by acollaborative team of scientists about 15 months ago), and the uniquerefractive properties of some photorefractive crystals, such as galliumarsenide and lithium niobate.andM;Photorefractive crystals are three-dimensional cubic structures, typicallythe size of a sugar cube, whose optical properties can be altered by light.andM;Bellcore's achievement could lead to advanced data base systems with&quot;ultra-rapid&quot; access times, dramatically faster computer processing, andimproved neural networks-based operations systems, according to Paek.andM;The three-person research team successfully recovered the equivalent of an 8&quot;x 11&quot; page of text from a miniature crystal-based storage system prototype inless than one nanosecond -- about a billionth of a second.andP;  (Today's typicalhigh-powered computer system generally requires about 10 milliseconds torecover a document stored in a computer's memory.)andM;The researchers estimate a computer system with a holographic memory couldstore more than a gigabyte (one-billion bytes) of data -- a capacity wellabove today's most advanced personal computers.andM;A photorefractive crystal measuring one cubic centimeter could store up to amillion holographic images -- considerably more information than can bestored on the flat surface of a semiconductor.andM;The technique involves taking light from a tiny microlaser just 40 millionthsof an inch across and dividing it into two seperate beams.andP;  Information inthe form of an optical image is then carried along one of these beams, whilethe second beam serves as a reference beam for the first.andP;  Light-regulatingmodulators, which are powered by electrical current, combine the two beams inthe crystal to create three-dimensional holographic images.andP;  Such imagesresemble light and dark lines spread in microscopically thin bands.andM;The stored information -- now a holographically recorded memory -- can beretrieved at a moment's notice when illuminated by the original referencebeam.andP;  This beam is comprised of an array of micron-sized lasers withtremendous focusing capability.andP;  The desired information is routed onto thearray for transmission to a computer display screen.andM;The research team is refining the new memory and retrieval technique, whichwill be used in continuing work on optical neural networks -- computers thatuse pulses of light combined with chip technology to imitate human learningprocesses.andM;While conventional computers can perform most calculations faster than thehuman brain, most also process information serially -- that is, one piece ofinformation at a time.andP;  The scientists anticipate their far-reaching computerstorage advancement will spur creation of neural systems capable of parallelreadout -- the ability to perform several tasks simultaneously.andP;  Possibleapplications include use of the storage process in high-speed, high-capacityswitching and data-processing equipment needed to provide future multimediatelecommunications services.andM;The research team recently published their findings in &quot;Optics Letter,&quot; aninternationally circulated publication of the Optical Society of America.andM;Bellcore provides research and other technical support to the telephonecompanies of Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis,Southwestern Bell Corp. and U S WEST, as well as Cincinnati Bell and TheSouthern New England Telehone Company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
