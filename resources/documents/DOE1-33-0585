The outlook presented in this papergives due consideration to the implication of these factors on the economicand energy situations of these countries during the period under consideration.The increase in demand for energy and oil, although moderate, is expectedto be about 50% (10 mboe/d) and 39% (4.5 mboe/d) over the 1984 levelby the year 2000, respectively. In spite of the clear difference betweenthe growth in energy and oil consumption, the latter would continue todominate the energy scene in these countries with over 53% share in thetotal energy mix, by the end of the period. The outlook for energy supplyis foreseen to continue to be comfortable. 2 references, 6 figures, 12tables.</TEXT></DOC>
