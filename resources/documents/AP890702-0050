Residents of the homeland town of Leeuwfontein said as many as2,000 people had been rounded up in a police dragnet. A privatecivil rights group said some were being beaten and stoned by policeseeking vengeance for the clash Saturday between security forces andresidents.   The reports could not be confirmed.   Witnesses said the riot erupted after security forces moved in tobreak up an ``illegal'' gathering at a local sports field in thevillage of Leeuwfontein, 150 miles northwest of Johannesburg, andopened fire without warning, killing two people and wounding severalothers.   They said an angry mob then attacked a government armoredvehicle, setting it afire with gasoline bombs. Four of the nineofficers inside burned to death and five others were killed withaxes and rocks as they tried to escape, the witnesses said.   Police confirmed that two people were killed by gunfire but saidthe nine officers were the victims of an ``unprovoked attack.''Although they were described as police, the type of vehicle involvedis normally used by the army forces there.   Police and military roadblocks were set up around Leeuwfontein, atown of about 15,000 that was incorporated Dec. 31 into the tribalhomeland of Bophuthatswana over the objections of most of itsinhabitants.   Bophuthatswana is one of nearly a dozen black homelands withinSouth Africa that the government considers nominally independent.   The homelands are not recognized internationally as separatecountries, and critics say such boundary changes in South Africahave deprived thousands of people of South African citizenship andthe job opportunities that go with it.   The homeland system in effect helps South Africa's blackpopulation, now at 28 million. The 5 million whites control theeconomy and dominate the government.   Officers were searching for weapons, ammunition and otherequipment taken from security forces during the turmoil, the SouthAfrican Broadcasting Corporation said.   Journalists were allowed into the sports field where scorchedground and bloody rocks were visible, but saw none of the detaineesthat villagers claimed had been rounded up by police in a sweep thatlasted well into Sunday.   Observers said the figure of 2,000 arrested was probablyexaggerated. Mrs. Joanne Yawitch, a spokeswoman for the TransvaalRural Action Committee (TRAC), a private organization, said ``quitea lot'' of people had been detained but could not give any figures.   The South African Press Association quoted her as saying some ofthose held were ``gathered into an open space and stoned and beatenby the police,'' but did not know if anyone had been killed.   Many other people were said by local residents to have fled intothe thick bush around Leeuwfontein, some of them making their wayacross the ill-defined boundaries to refuge in nearby South Africanblack townships.   Independent witnesses also confirmed that South African police,using powerful Casspir armored vehicles, were taking part in thepost-riot dragnet. The South African Press Association earlierquoted a police spokesman, Lt. R.W. Olivier, as denying TRAC's claimthat South African police were operating in the territory.   Bophuthatswana, actually seven separate parcels of territory inthe north-central part of the country, has an estimated populationof 1.7 million.   Some residents of Leeuwfontein have asked South African courts tooverturn a 1988 government edict that added their town of 15,000people and neighboring Braklaagte, with 9,000 people, toBophuthatswana.   Braklaagte citizens earlier lost a legal appeal, and in March,police there were accused of beating people who refused to declarethemselves citizens of Bophuthatswana.</TEXT></DOC>
