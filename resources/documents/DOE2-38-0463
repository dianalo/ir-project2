Measurement of the mass factorof sample attenuation at the energy of primary or harder radiation issubstituted in the method for measurement of line intensities of undeterminedelements. The method was tested when analyzing artificial mixtures ofNi, Co, Fe, Cr and Mg oxides under X-ray fluorescence excitation by /sup109/Cd radionuclide radiation. Measurement of the mass attenuation factorwas conducted at /sup 241/Am energy.</TEXT></DOC>
