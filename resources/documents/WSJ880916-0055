The new facility will utilize 12 combustion turbines, each capable of generating about 65,000 kilowatts of electricity, the utility said. Preferred fuel will be natural gas or propane, although the turbines will be capable of burning oil.    Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric said its preferred site is about 150 acres in Butler County, Ohio. The utility, which plans to begin the licensing process this year, hopes to start construction in 1990 and begin operating some units in 1993. The company's current generating units are 16 to 23 years old. </TEXT></DOC>
