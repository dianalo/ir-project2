However, previously DMM 124.56 prohibitedany markings on a parcel containing firearms or switchblade and ballisticknives to indicate its contents. To resolve this dilemma. 124.552 is changedto require a postmaster who <T3>has knowledge </T3>that a parcel contains the above items, to satisfyhimself that the addressee is permitted to receive the parcel. The changeimposes the same obligation on the carrier responsible for delivery tothe addressee. Changes are also made to 124.553 to clarify that a writtenstatement on mailability cannot be required of a mailer but only requested,and only of mail not sealed against inspection. Mail sealed against inspectioncannot be detained.In part 154, <T3>Plant Load Operations, </T3>section 154.625a, <T3>Highway Transportation Trailers, </T3>is revised to provide that reimbursementfor each highway transportation trailer will be equal to the actual dailycost to the Postal Service to lease the trailer, times the number of detentionperiods determined per 154.625. Sections 154.142, and 154.143 are revisedfor language consistency and 154.271 is revised to update a position title(PB 21672, 5-12-88).Sections 490, 690 and 790, ancillary services for second-, third-, andfourth-class mail, are revised by the addition of a section (495, new 693,and 795) to clarify forwarding and return treatment instructions for piecesin these classes of mail that have mail of a higher class enclosed or attachedin accordance with section 136, <T3>Mixed Classes of Mail </T3>(PB 21672, 5-12-88).Section 494, <T3>Refunds for Duplicate Notices, </T3>is added to clarify Postal Servicepolicy concerning the circumstances under which fees will be refunded forduplicate address correction notices sent to publishers of second-classpublications. Publishers of second-class publications may receive a refundof fees paid for duplicate address correction notices in two types of situations.First, for publishers participating in Address Change Service (ACS), arefund is authorized when a publisher receives duplicate tape notices.Second, a refund is authroized for fees paid for duplicate notices providedby a computerized Forwarding System/Central Mark-Up Unit (CFS/CMU) on Forms3579, Undeliverable Second-, Third- and Fourth-Class Matter. To be eligiblefor a refund of fees, publishers must submit documentation that substantiatesthe number of duplicate notices received (PB 21672, 5-12-88).In section 642.13, <T3>Authorization at Additional Offices, </T3>previous section 642.134has been deleted. No need is seen now to require a mailer to submit a samplecopy of third-class material being mailed at special rates solely becauseit is mailed from an office authorized pursuant to the procedures in 642.13.Deletion of this requirement complies with 642.11 and 642.12.Section 642.42, <T3>Record of Postage Paid, </T3>is revised to state clearly that mailingsmade at the regular bulk third-class rates while an application for specialbulk rates is pending may be eligible for a refund of the difference betweenthe amount paid at the regular rates and the amount due at the specialrates regardless of the method used to pay postage.

Section 723.3, <T3>Enclosures </T3>(mailed with bulk bound printed matter) is revisedto allow samples of merchandise enclosed with bound printed matter to beidentified as ``free gifts'' where it is clear that they are being offeredto the addressee in a marketing effort to encourage the sale of the giftproducts. The marketing effort may also promote the sale of bound printedmatter. Samples of merchandise must comprise only an incidental portionof each bound printed matter mailpiece (PB 21672, 5-12-88). Section 941, <T3>Money Orders, </T3>is revised to retain the restriction institutedin August 1987, that imposed a $10,000 per day limit on the amount of moneyorders one person can purchase. The Postal Service, in cooperation withthe Department of the Treasury, is participating in the broad federal effortto curb illegal drug activity through all reasonable means, including makingit more difficult to convert (``launder'') the cash proceeds from drugsales into apparently legitimate financial accounts and instruments. Thepurchase limit applies on a daily basis to each postal customer whetherthe purchases are made at one time or throughout the day, regardless ofthe postal facility or facilities used. There are no exceptions to thisrestriction (PB 21672, 5-12-88).
