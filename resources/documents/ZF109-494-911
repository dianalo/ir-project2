Hecker, directorof resources, community and economic development information systems forGAO's Information Management and Technology Division.andM;IRM controls at ASCS have sparked an investigation by the House GovernmentOperations Subcommittee on Government Information, Justice and Agriculture.andO;At a hearing last month, Chairman Rep.andP;  Bob Wise (D-W.Va) asked ASCSofficials to prepare a written response to GAO's findings andrecommendations.andM;&quot;This is a matter of urgent importance because the ASCS is planning anear-billion-dollar upgrade of its 2,800 county office systems in the nearfuture,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If the same mistakes are repeated, my fear is that theUSDA's cash cow is in for another milking.&quot;andM;Sarita G. Schotta, deputy administrator for management, said she is leadingefforts to improve IRM management in ASCS, but in many ways the agency is&quot;maxed out&quot; technically and needs new equipment.andP;  Since taking office lessthan a year ago, Schotta said she has tried to improve the technical trainingof ASCS officials and encouraged the use of advanced automation.andM;But GAO's Hecker painted a picture of an agency where IRM efforts have goneunchecked by ASCS management for too long.andP;  Inadequate requirementsdefinitions led ASCS to contract for development of a pair of inventorysystems.andP;  That project is six years behind schedule and $54 million overbudget, she said.andM;Hecker said agency officials had ignored warnings from the ArchitectureDepartment's inspector general about the procurement of the two systems, theGrain Inventory Management System (GIMS) and the Processed CommodityInventory Management System (PCIMS).andM;The delays and seven-fold increase in the cost of GIMS and PCIMS can beblamed on poor agency requirements, Hecker said.andP;  GIMS was brought on linetwo years behind schedule in 1986, while PCIMS is not expected to beoperational before July.andM;Additionally, GAO found the agency had requested an unjustified $57 milliondollars in upgraded disk storage for minicomputers in its 2,800 countyoffices.andP;  The agency used an erroneous computer model to gauge its futurestorage needs, Hecker said.andM;In a report released at the hearing, GAO recommended the agency improve IRMmanagement to ensure ASCS defines system requirements adequately andmaintains control over large system acquisitions.andP;  The reports also calledfor ASCS to create a software maintenance program and drop plans to requestthe $57 million for disk storage upgrades in the county offices.andM;ASCS officials already have withdrawn the request for disk storage upgradefunds, Schotta said.andP;  ASCS can meet its county storage needs through 1992with $26 million still remaining in its ADP support budget, she said.andM;Wasted CapacityandM;GAO found problems in addition to the flawed needs estimate.andP;  Many officeswaste capacity by duplicating entries and work GIMS should handle, Heckersaid.andP;  County ASCS officials also fail to remove data no longer needed,clogging the minicomputer system used by the counties, she said.andM;Wise chastised the agency for ignoring the IG reports, which he said mighthave helped the agency avoid the problems with GIMS and PCIMS.andP;  Three IGreports issued during the past six years called for tighter IRM management ofthe procurement, he said.andM;GAO reported that several items in the IG reports were ignored by ASCSofficials and the findings were not shared directly with Arthur Andersen andamp;Co., the Chicago consulting firm that won the ASCS contract.andM;&quot;We don't have IGs to simply issue reports that go unnoticed,&quot; Wise said.andO;&quot;IG reports need to be taken seriously and shared with those that areaffected.&quot;andM;Buy OvershadowandM;Thomas Burke, director of ASCS' Kansas City Management Office, said he didnot recall why the reports were never provided to Arthur Andersen.andP;  But hesaid he thinks many of the problems the agency encountered in developing theprocurement systems occurred because the procurement was overshadowed by theongoing effort to install minicomputers in the county offices.andM;Hecker said the agency officials should have sensed there were problems withthe GIMS and PICMS requirements when they initially tried to award afixed-price contract to develop and install the systems.andM;Because the agency offered sketchy requirements in its request for proposals,no vendors responded, Hecker said.andP;  &quot;When they didn't get a response to thefixed-price RFP it should have been a trigger that more requirementsdefinition was needed,&quot; she said.andM;But instead of revamping the RFP's requirements, ASCS switched to acost-reimbursement buy.andP;  It awarded a $7 million contract to Arthur Andersenin 1983.andM;&quot;No one -- neither ASCS nor any bidder -- expected to build GIMS and PCIMSfor that amount,&quot; said Marie Campagna, an Arthur Andersen partner who workedon the ASCS projects.andM;&quot;The fact is, ASCS did not know what the systems should look like and haddefined the requirements for purposes of the RFP simply to provide acomparative baseline to assess competing bidders on a level playing field,&quot;she said.andM;The agency's IRM woes were exacerbated by changing management at ASCS, Heckersaid.andP;  Schotta is the sixth manager in as many years.andP;  Hecker said theresults has been indifferent support for the two inventory systems.andM;GIMS is not providing the services necessary to users in the county offices.andO;Because of this, ASCS now faces a storage capacity crunch, Hecker said.andM;Users cannot get all there needs through GIMS, so they download data topersonal computers and re-enter other data, she said.andP;  &quot;Double data entry isan extremely inefficient process,&quot; she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
