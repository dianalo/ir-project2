The selection concludes a protracted competition set up by the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, which narrowed the running to the two companies last July. The so-called national test bed facility will be built at the Falcon Air Force Station in Colorado, but will be electronically linked to other facilities around the country that are working on the multibillion-dollar anti-missile research project.    The test facility, which will be completed in five years, is designed to show in simulated fashion how a small array of sensors and weapons satellites would detect and intercept enemy missiles. Tests so far have focused on discreet components of a possible strategic defense system.    The Martin Marietta computer simulations are also intended to aid the Pentagon in defining the sort of &quot;battle management,&quot; or command-and-control system, that would be needed to run a space-based anti-missile system. A Pentagon study two years ago concluded that the SDI planners had at that time devoted inadequate attention to the computers that would have to control hundreds of separate sensors and weapons systems.    In a prepared statement, El Segundo, Calif.-based Rockwell said the loss of the test-facility contract &quot;doesn't signify a major change in our business,&quot; which includes $600 million in other Strategic Defense Initiative programs.    In other awards announced by the Pentagon, Boeing Co. received Air Force contracts totaling $70.6 million for improvements to Minuteman missiles and modifications to space-launch vehicles.    Units of Gencorp Inc. won contracts totaling $13.8 million for rocket motors for the Navy and rocket-motor parts for the Air Force.    General Dynamics Corp. was awarded a $10.4 million Air Force contract for engineering services for F-16 aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
