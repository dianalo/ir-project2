(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Social workers say a U.S. Supreme Courtruling that protects them from lawsuits for failing to prevent childabuse means more cases will be reported, but critics say it denieschildren their constitutional rights.   The court ruled Wednesday that the state of Wisconsin was notliable for the injuries of 9-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was leftpermanently brain- damaged and physically disabled from beatings byhis father beginning in 1983.   The boy's mother, Melody DeShaney, sued the department forallegedly violating the boy's constitutional rights by failing toprevent the abuse.   The lawsuit contended social workers failed to take actiondespite their suspicions the boy had been abused several times byhis father, Randy, before the child was hospitalized in March 1984.   The boy remains institutionalized in the custody of the WinnebagoCounty Department of Social Services.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, saidthe state's awareness of the abuse did not mean it had a duty toprotect him because he was not in the custody of the state at thetime.   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshuafaced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor didit do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,''Rehnquist said.   Tom Birch, counsel for the National Child Abuse Coalition inWashington D.C., said the decision ``should have a positive effecton child protective services throughout the country.''   Birch and others in child abuse prevention said the rulingalleviates social workers' fears of being sued, and that a rulingagainst the workers could have affected their judgment in reportingcases.   ``When they are not held to the high standard of liability thiscase imposes, they will have the flexibility they need to protectthe child when appropriate,'' Birch said.   Others, however, said the court's 6-3 decision weakens programsdesigned to prevent child abuse.   Elaine Olson, executive director of the Wisconsin Children'sTrust Fund, said the decision threatens the safety of children inabusive environments.   ``Essentially what they're (the court) saying is that childrenhave no protection under the Constitution,'' Olson said. ``Thepurpose of child protective services is to get child abuse cases toauthorities who can do something about them.''   Joshua's case was brought to the department's attention in 1983when he was hospitalized for cuts and bruises. The boy was returnedto his father's custody, and social worker Ann Kenmeter visitedseveral times. The boy's mother was living in Cheyenne, Wyo.   On March 7, 1984, Kenmeter visited the home but did not see theboy. She was told the boy had fainted in the bathroom days earlierfor no apparent reason.   Kenmeter did not ask to see the boy, according to court records.   Joshua was hospitalized a day later for head injuries thatdestroyed half his brain, court records show.   Randy DeShaney was convicted of two counts of child abuse andsentenced to two prison terms of two years each. He was releasedafter 2{ years.   The Supreme Court ruled that even though the boy was inprotective custody resulting from an earlier incident in the home,``the state does not become the permanent guarantor of anindividual's safety by having once offered him shelter.''   ``We conclude that a state's failure to protect an individualagainst private violence simply does not constitute a violation ofthe Constitution's due process clause,'' the court said.   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron White, John Paul Stevens,Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   In dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote, ``Poor Joshua! It isa sad commentary upon American life and consitutional principles ...that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out theremainder of his life profoundly retarded'' and without the abilityto sue the state.   Joining Blackmun in the dissent were Justices William J. Brennanand Thurgood Marshall.</TEXT></DOC>
