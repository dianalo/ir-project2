The broadcast Friday said the highest death toll _ 21 soldiersand 18 rebels _ was in the Shan States, one of many areas of thecountry plagued by an insurgency by ethnic groups demanding greaterregional autonomy.   The 83 clashes with ``various rebel groups'' Oct. 1-21 left 110government troops wounded and six others missing, the radio said.   A government spokesman earlier said that from Sept. 26 toMonday, 35 government soldiers were killed and 95 wounded in thosebattles, which are continuing. He said rebel casualities werebelieved to be heavy.   Friday's announcement mentioned only two troops and three rebelskilled in Karen State.   The guerrilla groups have been fighting the government for thepast four decades.   The government also has acknowledged that besides theinsurgents, its troops killed more than 450 people since Gen. SawMaung seized power in a coup Sept. 18. Western diplomats say thevictims included large numbers of people peacefully demandingdemocracy, but the government says most were looters and other``destructive elements.''   While banning pro-democracy demonstrations, Saw Maung'sadministration has allowed formation of opposition parties andpromised a general election sometime next year.   The radio said four more parties registered Friday, bringing thenumber of officially recognized parties to 32.   The four new parties included two parties of the Chin minoritygroup _ the Zomi National Congress and the Chin National League forDemocracy. Four other minority-based parties registered earlier.   The broadcast added that announcements will be made later on theregistration of a dozen more parties.</TEXT></DOC>
