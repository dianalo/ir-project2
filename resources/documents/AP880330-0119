SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If the two sides trying to force changes inthe 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearlybalance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.   The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliensfrom its national head count. Traditionally, it counts everyoneliving in the country.   Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend largeconcentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seatsin the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.   Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to beincreased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.   At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributedamong the states on the basis of population.   ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be aflip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said WilliamO'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent PopulationReference Bureau.   O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwestmembers of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14House seats following the 1990 census. That would continue a trendevident over the last several decades, he noted.   Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercountedminorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in theother would make little difference in the long run.   The only change, he said, would be that California would gainfive new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two ratherthan just one.   ``That's easy to understand, since there are so manyundocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.   O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to bethe big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with again of four and Texas adding three.   Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina,Georgia, and Arizona.   On the other hand New York would lose three seats. States losingtwo apiece would be Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.</TEXT></DOC>
