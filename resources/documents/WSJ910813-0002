The 190 gas-producing concerns that form Pacific Gas'sCanadian supply pool approved the slightly sweetened terms ofthe proposal. Under the new pricing agreement, producers willget $1.35 to $1.75 per thousand cubic feet of gas, down froma previous price range of $1.60 to $1.90. Producers alsoaccepted a reduction in the average price paid for the gas,to $1.53 per thousand cubic feet from $1.80 in the contractyear ended July 31.</LP><TEXT>   Debate over appropriate pricing levels had become moreheated in recent weeks. Most producers said they were willingto accept a lower price for gas sold to Pacific Gas underlong-term contracts. But some argued that the prices offereddidn't reflect the long-term nature of the supplies or coverthe costs of finding and producing the gas.   The dispute forced Alberta's provincial energy minister,Rick Orman, to intervene and extend the negotiating period toAug. 15 from Aug. 1. Without such an extension, gas shipmentsto California could have been disrupted and subjected toheavy fines of more than $1 million daily.   Donald McMorland, president of Pacific Gas's gasprocurement unit, Alberta andamp; Southern Gas Co., said he ishappy with the vote results. &quot;This approval will ensure oursales to PGandamp;E on behalf of the producers will be maintainedfor the next year,&quot; he said.   In the contract year ended July 31, Alberta producers soldmore than $800 million of gas to Pacific Gas.</TEXT></DOC>
