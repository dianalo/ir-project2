Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Council ofFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees said thegovernment regulations upheld by a federal court here Tuesdayshould be applied in all public and commercial buildings.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a challenge to theEnvironmental Protection Agency regulations by a trade group thatcomplained the rules failed to set a safe level of exposure toairborne particles of asbestos.   ``This argument is meritless,'' a three-judge panel said.``Congress explicitly recognized that experts presently disagreeover what levels of exposure are safe.''   EPA's regulations require schools to conduct visual inspectionsof asbestos-containing building materials to determine if they aredamaged.

Koch says the head ofthe White House Conference for a Drug-Free America is under ordersnot to embarrass the Reagan administration, and as a result, thepanel is ``a farce.''   Conference Chairwoman Lois Haight Herrington is ``doing her job,she's under orders and she's carrying them out very effectively,''Koch said Tuesday outside a meeting of the conferees.   Asked if he believed those orders were coming from the WhiteHouse, Koch said: ``or whoever is in charge of making sure thatthis commission doesn't rock the boat, that this commission doesn'tfix responsibility and that this commission doesn't make requestsof the Reagan administration that they don't want to engage in.''   And the mayor complained to fellow conferees that they had notbeen given a draft report.   ``If we are now dealing with the single most important issue inAmerica _ everybody says that _ and here we are in this small,little, uncomfortable room, not having had the material presentedto us _ it's a farce,'' Koch said.   After pointing out the failure of the current efforts to stemthe flow of drugs, Koch exclaimed, ``This is not a war on drugs _this is a joke.''   Herrington responded to Koch's criticism by saying, ``If I wasmayor of the biggest city with the biggest drug problem in theworld, I'd be frustrated, too.''</TEXT></DOC>
