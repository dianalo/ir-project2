The statistical description of the powderedalloy SmCo{sub 5} provides a notion of the percentage of particles ofdifferent dimensions and shapes contained in the powder, the possibilityof their orientation in the magnetic field. This article examines thedependences of residual magnetization of the body of separate particlesof a highly coercive powder on the mean dimension, the shape, the ratioof the major l and the minor d axes of the particle, of the angle betweenthe l-axis and the direction of the magnetic moment. Also discussed arethe particle distribution according to size and magnetization, the dependencesof the grain-size distribution of the powders on the time of comminution.</TEXT></DOC>
