Du Pont said most of the 1,100 full-time employees at the plant will be offered jobs at its other electronics operations near New Cumberland, at plants in Clearfield, Pa., and Emigsville, Pa., or in Wilmington.    The company said it will eliminate 350 part-time positions at the New Cumberland plant, which makes electronic connectors, such as the assemblies that connect cables to computers.    Du Pont said it is consolidating its central Pennsylvania production because new technologies at electronic connector plants have led to increased efficiency and excess capacity world-wide. </TEXT></DOC>
