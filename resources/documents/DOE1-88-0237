At Oldenburgh University a small laboratory buildingis in operation whose energy supply is covered by solar radiation, windenergy and to a small extent by conventional fuel. Simulation calculationsfor such systems using experimentally validated models for convertersand storage devices are reported. In particular the influence of systemparameters such as size of different converters and battery capacityon the renewable fraction and the energy pay back time of the whole systemis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
