It is particularlyvaluable in situations where physical or chemical dose is unknown (asin accidents), where dose is difficult to standardize (as in irregularscheduling), or where individual biological susceptibility is likelyto vary (as in repair defectives or pharmacologic variants). The rapidrecent development of quantitative cytometry has provided a new multidisciplinary,potentially powerful analytical tool for biological dosimetry. Thesecytometric techniques offer the promise of objective, precise, sensitive,cellular and subcellular classification coupled with highly rapid, statisticallysound rates of analysis. They are ideally suited to the measurement ofbiological dosimetric responses in many mammalian systems. With 147 figs.,26 tabs..</TEXT></DOC>
