The crackdown was widely viewed as an attempt by the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, the country's dominant political party, to reassert its authority at a time of worsening racial tensions. The party was seriously weakened last April by an internal dispute that nearly resulted in the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as its president.    Among those arrested yesterday were Lim Kit Siang, secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party and the country's chief opposition leader. At least four other members of his party were detained, including his son, Lim Guan Eng. Both men are members of Malaysia's Parliament.    The police sweep capped an unsettling 18 months for the country. Racial antagonism, particularly between the Malay majority and large ethnic-Chinese minority, has been festering. Fighting among the country's governing political parties and within those parties -- especially the dominant UMNO -- have added to the unease.    &quot;UMNO is flexing its muscles to intimidate its partners (in the government),&quot; said a British political analyst who asked not to be identified. Both police and UMNO officials yesterday declined to comment on the arrests.    The most divisive recent incident was the appointment of non-Mandarin-speaking teachers to senior posts in Chinese primary schools. Some of UMNO's coalition partners joined opposition parties in protesting the appointments and supported boycotts of the primary schools earlier this month. Chinese educators and parents maintain that non-Mandarin-speaking school administrators lack the understanding to perpetuate their cultural heritage. Mandarin is the language of instruction in Chinese primary schools.    In another dispute earlier this year, the Malaysian Chinese Association threatened to withdraw from the ruling coalition unless the government pledged to guarantee the deposits made in a number of shaky financial institutions. That squabble was eventually resolved.    Then 10 days ago, a shooting spree by an army private that left one Malay dead and another Malay and an ethnic Chinese wounded triggered rampant rumors of curfews and potential racial violence. The arrest of the private, who is Malay, defused tensions.    Analysts immediately drew a comparison between the current situation and the racial violence that flared in May 1969, leaving nearly 200 people dead. Malaysia's leaders in that year declared a national emergency after the riots and gradually restored order. UMNO recently has organized rallies to champion Malay unity and uphold Malay sovereignty. </TEXT></DOC>
