Ryzhkov on Saturday announcedplans to abolish 18 state agencies, slash the number of Cabinetposts, and surrender some power to the republics in the biggestgovernment overhaul of the Gorbachev era.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been streamlining anddecentralizing the Soviet bureaucracy because he blames it forimpeding his economic reforms.   The Cabinet, or Council of Ministers _ which Ryzhkov heads _ hasbeen widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes.   Speaking to a joint session of the nation's new two-chamberlegislature, the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov said of the 100 Cabinetmembers appointed in 1984, only 10 will remain.   He also told the session, broadcast live on state-run radio andtelevision, that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries,construction, transport, agriculture and defense, only 32 wouldremain.   One of those eliminated will be the Ministry of Light Industry,which oversees production of chronically scarce consumer goods.   Ryzhkov, a 59-year-old technocrat re-elected premier onWednesday, said the remaining ministries in Moscow would abandonday-to-day management of the country's industries and focus insteadon long-range planning as well as scientific and technological work.   Gorbachev, who came to power in 1985, has said his goal is to ridSoviet society of a half-century of top-heavy, bureaucraticmanagement ``by command'' epitomized by dictator Josef V. Stalin.   In earlier phases of Gorbachev's program, ministry staffs werecut by thousands, and several ministries were consolidated into asuperagency for agriculture.   In March, however, the leadership decided to abolish thesuperagency, which was blamed for mismanagement of food productionand distribution that has left some grocery shelves bare.   Ryzhkov said some economic management functions will betransferred to the 15 Soviet republics, many of which arecampaigning for greater control over their affairs.   He mentioned specifically that the Ministry of ConstructionMaterials would be abolished and that republics would controlbuilding supplies. Several lawmakers have complained that shortagesof construction materials cause long delays in projects.   Despite the proposed reductions, two committees will be formed _one to handle natural and manmade disasters and another to planeconomic reforms. Leonid Abalkin, a prominent economist, will handlethe economic panel.   The government ministries were frequently criticized during 13days of debate by the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies,which ended its session Friday.   At one point, Deputy Anatoly Miloserdny of Byelorussia blamed theCabinet for short-sightedness that he said led to ``thedisappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.''   Gorbachev urged deputies to grill ministers on why they aredragging their feet on reforms. He acknowledged complaints that theagencies ``are restructuring very slowly, if at all.''   ``We have to find out what is wrong,'' he said.   The Soviet Union suffers from a budget deficit projected to reach$162 billion this year, inflation estimated last year at 8 percentto 9 percent, and poverty that affects millions of people.   Ryzhkov on Saturday announced nominees for the 10 Cabinet poststhat will remain. Supreme Soviet committees are scheduled to holdconfirmation hearings beginning June 19.   Among those nominated to remain in their posts are KGB secretpolice chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and Defense Minister Dmitri T.Yazov.   The full Supreme Soviet is to reconvene June 26 to vote on thenominations and then draft legislation in a session that will last amonth and 10 days, Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov announced.   In other work Saturday, the Supreme Soviet named heads of 14committees to oversee such areas as state security, law enforcementand farming in addition to economic reform.   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin was named head of a committeeon construction and architecture.</TEXT></DOC>
