Others boasted of making $8,000 a week and more. And then there wasDavid Stuckrath. He was introduced as earning &quot;over $1 million a year.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FIRM'S TACTICS WATCHEDWATER FILTER SALES WORRY AUTHORITIES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;It sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it?&quot; Stuckrath asked thethrong, estimated by a Fairmont concierge at close to 1,000. The only troubleis, that's just what officials in a number of states fear.;    Consumerauthorities are afraid the operation of National Safety Associates, a Memphisfirm whose air and water filters were touted at the Fairmont event, is farfrom the golden opportunity that thousands of enthusiastic investors inCalifornia and elsewhere think it is.;    State officials and former NSAdistributors have accused those associated with the firm of costing consumersand distributors millions of dollars.;    Some complaints involve allegedscare tactics by sales agents, who reportedly have lied to potential customersby telling them their water is so polluted it can cause them cancer or evendeath. Authorities also are trying to determine whether NSA is a pyramidscheme, something NSA officials strenuously deny.;    &quot;You're going to findthat NSA is a different kind of business, an unconventional business,&quot;Stuckrath told the Fairmont audience. But, he emphasized, &quot;this is not apyramid.&quot;;    Companies involved in pyramid schemes typically don't emphasizethe sale of products or services so much as attracting an ever-growing army ofinvestors. In such scams, the investors often are required to plunk downthousands of dollars for the right to sell the product or service. The lure isthat they can then make substantial sums through commissions -- by attractingother investors like themselves.;    Eventually, pyramid operations wind upwith too many salespeople and too few customers -- and investors withbasements and garages full of things they can't sell.;    Consumer fraudofficials in Santa Clara County said they had not heard any complaints aboutNSA or its distributors.;    But others have:;    (check) San Diegoauthorities announced in September that an independent NSA salesrepresentative had agreed to pay $75,000 to settle a consumer protection suitbrought by Attorney General John Van de Kamp. The suit claimed the salesman&quot;had purported to sell water purification devices when they were reallyselling the right to recruit distributors.&quot;;    (check) Wisconsin officialslast year ordered NSA to pay restitution to 3,000 customers, claiming &quot;NSAused deceptive practices.&quot;;    (check) New York's attorney general last yearaccused NSA and some of its distributors of making &quot;exaggerated andfrightening claims about drinking water in order to persuade consumers topurchase the water filters.&quot;;    (check) Oregon officials have launched aprobe of the firm after receiving 15 complaints about NSA. Some are fromelderly customers who were told &quot;their water was causing heart attacks and thewater filter would protect them,&quot; said Jan Margosian, the state's consumerinformation coordinator.;    (check) Kentucky authorities also have NSA underscrutiny. &quot;We have received complaints and we are looking into them,&quot; saidRhonda Blackburn, a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general.;    Otherplaces that reportedly have taken action against NSA or have begun inquiriesof the firm include Connecticut, Michigan and Canada.;    Robert Pratt of LosGatos, an NSA distributor who moderated the promotional event Saturday at theFairmont, said NSA has been cooperating with the state inquiries. He deniedthe company was involved in a pyramid scheme, blaming the various stateinquiries on a few distributors who are &quot;get-rich-quick types,&quot; engaged inimproper sales tactics forbidden under NSA's own contracts.;    The scrutinydoesn't bother Terri Blanken, a 27-year-old NSA distributor from Redding,either. She said she invested $4,000 with the firm five months ago and alreadyhas parlayed that into a bundle by recruiting about a dozen otherdistributors.;    &quot;I've made $25,000,&quot; said Blanken, who has four kids andworks mostly out of her home. &quot;I love it.&quot;;    Some other distributors whoshowed up at the Fairmont event, however, haven't been as successful. Onewoman, who declined to give her name, said she invested $15,000 a couple ofmonths ago but hasn't made a profit yet.;    Still, she added hopefully, &quot;I'msupposed to.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVE JOHNSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910106  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  730  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 6, 199100006069,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
