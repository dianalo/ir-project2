The network, which replaces a slower system operated by thefoundation, is able to transmit 1.5 million bits of informationeach second, the equivalent of 50 pages of single-spacedtypewritten text, the foundation said at a news briefing.   The network allows participants to share research findings. Itsspeed is exceeded only by some private networks, the foundationsaid.   The network ``is a major element in our national technicaldevelopment,'' said William A. Wulf, the foundation's assistantdirector for computer and information science and engineering.``With this in place, we expect that scientists and researcherswill find new ways to work together on multidisciplinary andcross-regional research projects.''   The system is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., and operated by MeritInc., a consortium of Michigan universities, under a $14 million,five-year agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
