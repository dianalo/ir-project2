Brady said at aceremony marking the inauguration of the Financial CrimesEnforcement Network.   ``If we are ever going to be successful in getting drugs off thestreets of our cities, we must hit the business side by taking theprofit out of drug dealing,'' Brady said.   The Treasury center will gather information from prosecutors andpolice around the country and overseas, process it and try toidentify potential targets for investigation.   Center employees also will conduct research on money launderingand serve as a liaison between local, state and federal officials.   ``Some have talked about turf problems,'' said William J.Bennett, White House drug policy adviser. ``Here is another exampleof turf cooperation, indeed turf harmony.''   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the paper trail thatinvestigators once followed has become the electronic trail.   ``Drug dealers are ... making a lot of money and they're movingthat money through sophisticated and complicated financial channelsnot only across state lines but across international boundaries,''he said.   ``We will be matching, effort for effort, the kind ofsophistication the drug lords are imparting into theiroperations,'' Thornburgh said.</TEXT></DOC>
