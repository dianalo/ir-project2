(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Convoys of Army vehicles moved out ofFort Ord late Wednesday, hours after word was received that twobase battalions would be sent to Honduras to counter the reportedincursion of Nicaraguan forces into that country.   Three convoys of about 15 vehicles each, carrying both troopsand supplies, left the base shortly before midnight, apparentlybound for Travis Air Force Base, 125 miles north.   The sprawling Army base on the Monterey Peninsula was in themidst of an emergency exercise on Wednesday when it was informedthat the two units, consisting of at least 1,200 soliders, would besent to Honduras.   The White House announced that President Reagan was sendingabout 3,200 troops in an emergency deployment exercise to southernHonduras as a ``measured response'' to an incursion of Nicaraguanforces into that country.   Nicaragua denied that its troops had entered Honduras.   The American force includes about two battalions from the 7thInfantry Division Light at Ford Ord and two from the 82nd AirborneDivision at Fort Bragg, N.C., plus support units, the White Housesaid.   Fort Bragg officials said 1,400 to 1,500 soldiers would leavethe base at 6:30 a.m. Thursday.   ``It was really exciting,'' Pfc. Eugene Rice, 21, told TheCharlotte (N.C.) Observer. ``It was like, something's really goingto happen. We're finally going to get a chance to use ourtraining.''   Paul Boyce, a spokesman at Fort Ord, said the emergencydeployment exercise was routine and had started early Wednesday.   All 11,400 members of Fort Ord's Rapid Deployment Forceparticipated in the daylong exercise, which involved recallingtroops to the base for the checking of weapons, vehicles,identifications and other equipment, he said.   The Rapid Deployment Force is trained to respond at a moment'snotice to assignments throughout the world.   There are 21,000 soldiers at Fort Ord, about 80 miles south ofSan Francisco. Details of the transfer of troops were notimmediately available. Telephones at the base went unanswered orwere busy Wednesday night.   Several wives were told by their husbands that the battalionswould leave from Travis, where they would be flown to Florida andthen onto Honduras. Travis officials said they could not confirmthat arrangement.   ``I'm real terrfied, and so are all the wives,'' said SheilaBaesler.   Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker, said her husband toldher that his unit and the battalions would be flown to Florida fromTravis on Thursday morning.   ``He said some of the guys (on guard duty) are crying but (hesaid) everybody has to be strong,'' she told the Monterey Herald.Brylkewski said she spent most of the evening talking by telephonewith relatives of soldiers.   ``We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes fromthis,'' she said. ``I just don't want anybody to get hurt.''   Elsewhere at Fort Ord, the mood was somber. Mildred McIntyre,cashier at an officers club, said there were only about 30 peoplethere, two-thirds of them women. A normal night sees up to 250people, she said.   ``This is ladies' night, and we normally have an excellentcrowd,'' she said. `` Many of the females are saying their fiances,husbands, boyfriends are on alert, and they're depressed aboutthat.''   Fort Bragg is home to paratrooper units of the 82nd Airborne andthe Green Berets and has been called upon to send combat-readysoldiers to trouble spots around the world.   The 82nd Airborne was sent to Grenada for the U.S. invasion ofthe Caribbean Island in October 1983, and President Reagan alsochose the unit to help keep peace in the Sinai.   The Fayetteville (N.C.) Times reported Wednesday night, beforethe White House announcement, that roads to the 82nd Airborneheadquarters had been closed, and officers at checkpoints wereallowing only authorized military personnel through.   During the day Wednesday, the post outside Fayetteville wasabuzz with heavy-truck convoys carrying explosives, supplies werebeing loaded at klieg-lighted parking lots and cars were beingstopped at Military Police checkpoints.   Maj. Mike Nason, spokesman for the 82nd Airborne, said: ``I'mreally not at liberty to talk to you, but we're leaning forward inthe foxholes. We're watching CNN (Cable News Network) just like youare.''   Wives were seen dropping off their husbands in in combat gear.Asked what what was happening, one began to cry and to the News andObserver of Raleigh: ``I just can't answer any questions.''   ``They told us to get our stuff together,'' one unidentifiedsoldier told the newspaper. ``They're rigging trucks that they'venever rigged before. People don't know what to think. They don'tknow whether we're going to war or just doing a littlepeace-keeping. They're on ends right now.''   Capt. Donald M. Sensing, an Army spokesman at Fort Bragg, saidthat if paratroopers from Fort Bragg were ordered into battle, theyand their equipment would be transported in much the same way asthey were during Market Square One, a special four-day mock wargame held in October 1986.   Then, the entire division _ including helicopters, rank-and-fileinfantry, artillery units and support units _ was mobilized as ifthey had been called into battle. They were airlifted out of SouthCarolina and from Pope Air Force Base.</TEXT></DOC>
