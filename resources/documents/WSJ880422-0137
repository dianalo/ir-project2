Schmitt </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> INS </IN><TEXT>   WHEN JUDITH BRADLEY filed for worker compensation in California, she didn't have a scratch on her. The cake decorator at an Albertson's grocery store won anyway.    Harassment, she claimed, sparked her troubles. A new bakery-department manager trimmed her hours and used blunt language in evaluating her work. She left, stuttering, depressed and fearful of crowds, later getting some relief in court.    The case is &quot;bizarre,&quot; says Gary Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.    It is also routine.    In recent years, the cost of employee disability has become a bit disabling to employers themselves. Worker-compensation premiums covering on-the-job injuries hit $35 billion last year, double the 1980 level. About 65% of the premiums, which cover benefits, administrative costs and medical expenses, are channeled through private insurance companies, and the rest through government and corporate &quot;self-insured&quot; plans. Many experts believe the total damage is actually billions higher when factors such as lost workdays and after-hours injuries are included.    To many employers, disability is a system fraught with fraud, exaggerated claims and hyperactive plaintiffs' attorneys who hawk their services in screaming newspaper ads. Disability's definition has been stretched, too. These days, an emotional disorder that began far away from the job site will get you just about as much as a hernia or a bad back.    &quot;The system was well-equipped to handle an injury that you could see. With these fancy new theories, the system is starting to break down,&quot; complains F. Clinton Murphy, a Sacramento, Calif., attorney and former state worker-compensation judge. As a result, purported aid to disabled workers &quot;has become part of the welfare system,&quot; he says.    To employees, the bosses contribute to the problem. Rising costs reflect a growing tendency among employers to battle claims in court. Much of the increase also reflects escalating health-care costs across-the-board. And while benefit levels have risen in recent years, they remain puny in some states. Last year, for instance, the Arizona legislature boosted benefits for some disabled residents who had been receiving $20 a month for the past 60 years. They now receive $30 a month.    The California system, the nation's largest, is nearing gridlock, and it's hardly unique. Premiums nearly doubled between 1982 and 1986, but much of the increase reflects the cost of attorneys, medical experts and judges rather than sharply higher benefits. The rate of reported industrial accidents is actually falling, following a national trend. But new-fangled illnesses, including mental-stress, &quot;may strain the . . . system to the breaking point,&quot; maintains a new report by a state watchdog group.    It is already getting pretty close. In 1986, injured workers and their employers ran up nearly $1 billion in legal and medical bills in California courts -- more than most states spend on actual benefits in a year. In all of San Francisco, only two orthopedic doctors are acceptable as expert witnesses to both sides of the worker compensation bar; one way or another, all others are considered biased. Needless to say, the two are booked a year in advance, causing protracted adversary proceedings.    The whole system has the look of a mill. While the number of judges has remained constant for 20 years, claims have more than tripled. In an ironic twist, one jurist recently became a beneficiary himself after claiming that stress from the heavier workload triggered a stroke. He negotiated a brief respite.    Plaintiffs' attorneys typically carry 300 clients or more, making up in volume what they miss from modest fees, which are fixed at 9% to 12% of recoveries. &quot;Injured or Harassed at Work?&quot; asks an ad in the Los Angeles Times. &quot;Call the Work Trauma Hot Line.&quot;    &quot;It is like a supermarket,&quot; says Alfred C. Williams, the chief judge in San Francisco, who heard 25 cases on a recent morning.    Employers and insurance companies say employees will fake or exaggerate injuries and that the system helps to identify them. &quot;Concealable&quot; injuries, including sprains and strains, are more frequently reported on Monday mornings than are &quot;non-concealable&quot; ones, such as burns and broken bones, claims the National Council on Compensation Insurance. The group thinks some workers may be stretching the truth a bit after a long weekend.    With benefits becoming increasingly lucrative, &quot;there is a response to the incentives, and the incentives are getting stronger,&quot; asserts David Appel, vice president of the industry-supported group, which sets rates in 32 states.    Yet few insurers or prosecutors seem interested in nabbing outright crooks. Only one of 160 fraud cases reported to California authorities since 1979 was prosecuted. Some were dismissed as merely too time-consuming, including the case of a purported blind worker who was filmed loading building materials onto a truck -- and then taking the truck for a spin.    For almost a year, a San Jose, Calif., woman tricked her Silicon Valley employer into believing she was laid up with a twisted elbow. In fact, she was working elsewhere while her sister took her boss's check-up calls. San Francisco private investigator Duane Weeks trailed the woman, who was finally exposed, but Mr. Weeks doesn't believe his insurance-company client ever called the police. &quot;Carriers are reluctant to spend money if they don't have to,&quot; he says, declining to identify his client.    Proving especially troublesome for employers, insurers and attorneys are the surging number of claims for psychiatric disorders and stress. Stress claims in California rose 531% to nearly 7,000 annually between 1980 and 1986, with three of four applicants citing &quot;job pressures.&quot; Total claims (about 400,000 in 1986) rose less than 10% during the same period.    In Massachusetts, a recent court decision says the emotional trauma from simply being fired may be compensable. As a result, &quot;the phones begin to click&quot; every time a major employer in the state announces a layoff, says James O'Dea, insurance manager for the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents.    While such claims are hard to prove and usually involve mitigating factors, judges increasingly are sympathetic to them. Mrs. Bradley, the cake decorator, had a &quot;mild obsessive-compulsive personality&quot; even before her boss started yelling at her, according to court testimony. Her own psychiatrist said she may have been hypersensitive, but a California appeals court said the condition was irrelevant because the job helped to trigger the disability. She has received several thousand dollars in benefits, but her attorney says the final amount remains in dispute.    An employee at a Campbell Soup Co. plant in Sacramento, Calif., suffered a brief electrical shock after flicking a power switch. She claimed emotional as well as physical injuries, but Mr. Murphy, who represented Campbell's insurance company, questions the timing of the complaint.    &quot;She got a shock,&quot; he says, &quot;but the biggest shock was not on the job.&quot; The incident was &quot;a convenient focus&quot; for realizing stress from &quot;a painful marriage,&quot; the insurer's doctor asserted in court testimony. In January, the woman settled for a modest $5,000 after a six-year fight that cost the soup company nearly as much to defend. Her attorney declines comment.    &quot;What kind of system is that?&quot; demands Sacramento defense attorney Douglas Weill, who settled a claim recently for $7,000. Lawyers and doctors got half. Vigilant in the pursuit of cheaters, Mr. Weill keeps an eye out for dirty fingernails and callouses during depositions.    But employers themselves have been less than benevolent on occasion, refusing or delaying apparently legitimate claims. Stalling is cost-effective, critics charge, because most states bar separate lawsuits for bad-faith. Statutory penalties often exist but, at an average 10% of the benefits due, hardly punishing.    George Donnell thinks he was victimized twice. The 22-year-old former warehouse worker fell off a ladder while unshelving some linoleum at a Sacramento flooring company. After the jolt, he suffered back problems and a seizure. For a year, Mr. Donnell lived off $147 a week from a special state fund, while the ambulance that carted him to the hospital and the hospital itself threatened collection actions.    Meanwhile, the insurer -- unconvinced that Mr. Donnell fell at all -- declined payment. Sixteen months after the incident, when the case finally got to court, it settled for $12,000. That technique is &quot;prevalent,&quot; says Barbara McCarty, a lawyer who represented Mr. Donnell.    In addition, many disabled workers contend that benefits are cut off prematurely. After a severe heart attack, oil worker Fred Kastell figured he had an annuity for life. But last year, his old employer, a unit of Enserch Corp. of Dallas, figured the Arizona resident was fit enough to take a desk job. Enserch says his condition changed, but Mr. Kastell's wife says her husband is still ailing. What's more, she says he has never learned to read.    ---   Mr. Schmitt is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
