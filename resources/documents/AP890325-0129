(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Amtrak passenger train slammed into aflat-bed truck loaded with steel at a crossing Saturday, injuringmore than 20 people, authorities and witnesses said.   The accident occurred shortly before 11 a.m. as the truck drivertried to go around lowered crossing gates and collided with thetrain, sending 13-ton coils of steel flying. There were 43passengers and four crew members aboard the train.   Eleven people, including two train crew members and the driverof the truck, were treated for minor injuries and released from twoTrenton hospitals, officials said.   About a dozen passengers on the train were treated at the scene,said Capt. Ken Gorno of the Trenton Fire Department.   The train, named the Lake Cities, originated in Toledo, Ohio andwas headed to Detroit, 15 miles north of Trenton, when it struckthe truck between the cab and the flat-bed portion, officials said.   ``It sounded like somebody blew off a stick of dynamite,'' saidDavid Jones, 21, of Taylor.   Jones said he was waiting at the crossing when the truckattempted to pass around crossing gates that were being lowered.The signals at the crossing were on, witnesses said.   Conductor Gary L. Wilkins said the train was traveling at 50mph, the legal limit in the area.   Donald Hoppe, 58, of Livonia, was taking the train home with hiswife, Dorothy, after a trip to New York.   ``I thought somebody had bombed this train,'' Hoppe said.``That's why we took the train, because we're afraid to fly.''   After the crash, ``everyone was very calm,'' passenger LindaThomas, 37, of East Rochester, N.Y., traveling with two 11-year-olddaughters. ``Everyone on the train was so helpful.''   The truck was leased to Hawkins Steel Cartage of Southgate,officials said. Janise Hawkins, a part owner of the company, saidshe could not identify the driver and could not confirm or deny theeyewitness accounts of the accident.   She said the truck was hauling the coils of steel between twosteel plants in the area.   Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said the railway company wasinvestigating the accident and had not decided whether to seekcharges against the truck driver. But, she said, ``In the past wehave taken action in similar situations.''   Damage to the locomotive was estimated at $100,000, Martin said.It was moved to a nearby siding while another locomotive took thefour passenger cars to Detroit, she said.   Amtrak provided passengers who did not require hospitaltreatment with free bus transportation to stops along the LakeCities' route, including Detroit, Dearborn, Jackson, all inMichigan, and Chicago, Martin said.</TEXT></DOC>
