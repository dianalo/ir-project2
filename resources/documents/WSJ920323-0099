Certainly this is the case with trade retaliation. It'senshrined in section 301 of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, stillthe cornerstone of American trade law. Section 301 is thesubject of &quot;Aggressive Unilateralism&quot; (University of MichiganPress, 432 pages, $15.95), an insightful collection ofscholarly papers edited by Columbia University tradeeconomist Jagdish Bhagwati and Japan specialist Hugh T.Patrick. They emphasize legal as well as economic aspects ofthis perennial issue.</LP><TEXT>   The theory of trade retaliation is that by closing ourmarkets, or threatening to, we'll inflict harm on foreigners,forcing them to open their markets. Accordingly, righteousmembers of Congress now promote more aggressive retaliatorypolicies in the name of opening foreign markets and creatingAmerican jobs.   Although retaliation can harm a target country, it's hardto find a single case in which retaliation ever forced open asignificant market or brought about any other significantpolicy change. On the contrary, retaliation typicallyprovokes patriotic resistance in the target country, whichtends to mean more trade restrictions, government controlsand even war.   For some 3,000 years, the record of retaliation has beenlittered not just with failures but catastrophes. It was theattempt by Athens to retaliate against neighboring Megarathat triggered the disastrous Peloponnesian War. Trade warsbetween Venice and Genoa undermined their ability to competeagainst formidable rivals in the East. Louis XIV provoked onetrade war after another, bringing military conflict thenhumiliating bankruptcy.   European trade retaliation and counterretaliation was afactor in the outbreak of World War I. History's mostcatastrophic case of retaliation involved Germany; bysimultaneously demanding huge reparations payments andclosing their borders to German goods, the World War I alliesset the stage for German runaway inflation and finallyHitler. Later, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff shut out Japanesegoods, giving more credibility to Japanese militarists whoclaimed that Japan could prosper only through conquest.   Since then, the U.S. has retaliated against the countriesof the European Community, Japan, Brazil and others, withlittle to show for it. The biggest success for the 301process has been in the Japanese cigarette market, but thegains represent less than 2% of U.S. sales to Japan.   It seems arrogant to assume, as many advocates ofretaliation do, that we can push around other countries withimpunity. Mr. Patrick warns that &quot;the U.S.-Japan economicrelationship is fraught with danger. Both nations lackvision; both are beclouded by emotionalism andmisperceptions. But beyond that, both nations have severeproblems both in managing the relationship and managingthemselves.&quot;   Far from being a clever crowbar for opening foreignmarkets, trade retaliation has provided just another meansfor restricting the American market -- Washington alreadyenforces more than 12,000 import restrictions. As &quot;AggressiveUnilateralism&quot; points out, most support for the 301 processcomes not from exporters but from domestically orientedindustries that exploit any opportunity to restrict thefreedom of American consumers. For example, U.S.manufacturers of shoes, dishes and ferroalloys urged thegovernment to impose restrictions on their Braziliancompetitors to avenge a dispute involving computer softwarepiracy in Brazil.   If retaliation doesn't actually open significant markets,advocates claim that it at least strikes a blow againstunfairnessAmerica's trade deficit presumably being proof ofunfairness. Yet the trade deficit proves no such thing. &quot;Anygiven degree of protectionism is compatible with any level oftrade surplus or deficit,&quot; notes Mr. Bhagwati.   &quot;Aggressive Unilateralism&quot; shows that moral claims forretaliation are riddled with hypocrisy. Spurred on bypowerful lobbyists, Washington officials have shamelesslyharassed Hong Kong for its alleged &quot;unfair&quot; trade practices,yet the laissez-faire Hong Kong government has hardly anytrade practices at all. About the only ones are textile andapparel export quotas demanded by U.S. lobbyists via theMulti-Fiber Arrangement.   Trade retaliation is immoral because it deliberatelyinflicts harm on people who aren't a party to any tradedispute. Some victims are foreigners. To harm people simplybecause they're foreigners is to revive the odious doctrineof collective guilt. Besides, many victims are Americanconsumers forced to pay more for goods.   Officials might claim to know how far they can push atarget country before things get out of control, but they'retrafficking in xenophobic venom. Resentments aroused byretaliation take on a life of their own, and in hard timessuch resentments can become a firestorm. This is why so manydiplomats have been drenched in blood. It's a bad idea forgovernment officials to muck around with peaceful commerce.   ---   Mr. Powell is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute inWashington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
