Z-248 microcomputers.andM;The Army Materiel Command's finance and accounting section at Redstone isresponsible for paying 11,000 civilians every two weeks, said Lt.andP;  Col.andO;Lawrence Massman, finance and accounting officer.andP;  Before the Z-248a wereintroduced, supervisors manually filled out time and attendance cards foreach civilian employee and delivered them to payroll clerks.andM;The clerks then sorted the cards according to Social Security number.andP;  Thesorted cards were sent to keypunchers and batch processed, which Massman saidwas time-consuming and inefficient.andM;With the upgrade, payroll clerks and supervisors do data entry themselves atZ-248s, which Massman said function in the new system as smart terminals.andO;The 22 Z-248s have been adapted as network terminals for two mainframes withthe addition of Pcox 3270 emulator boards from Novell Inc.andM;Massman said the system upgrade was accomplished almost entirely withexisting equipment and is similar to changes he introduced to anothercivilian payroll system while stationed in Japan two years ago.andM;Supervisors throughout the base in Huntsville, Ala., input time andattendance records directly to the mainframes via rings of Unisys 6220s andother dumb terminals, also part of the existing ADP equipment at Redstone.andM;&quot;The whole idea was to get smart terminals doing smart things and eliminatethe labor-intensive keypunch process,&quot; Massman said Redstone pay clerks aresaving about 2,000 man-days per year by using the Z-248s as front-enddevices, he said.andM;&quot;Also, we've put a triple-redundant error checking procedure [into the newsystem] that increases the accuracy of data,&quot; said David Owens, a member ofRedstone's civilian payroll automation detail.andM;Owens said payroll clerks now have interactive access to all records on twoAmdahl Corp. mainframes at Redstone.andP;  The Amdahls run the standard Armycivilian pay system for the finance center in Indianapolis, through which theArmy makes pay reports to the Treasury Department.andM;Owens said the emulation process &quot;gives users access to records on what isessentially a 170-gigabyte file server.&quot;andP;  Screen-to-screen data transfercapability and access to many general-use applications such as spreadsheetsare now available through this network, he said.andP;  On the Z-248s, payrollclerks communicate directly with the Unisys terminals, Owens said.andM;Massman said Capt.andP;  Steven Pyle, now working in the Army Accounting andFinance Center in Indianapolis, wrote the front-end programs for the Z-248swhile working as a branch chief in Japan.andP;  Limited communications capabilityat the overseas payroll office required that data be moved via floppy disk tomainframes.andM;Owens said he was able to add the communications portion to the Redstoneupgrade in part because a Memorex Telex Corp. 274-C2 controller was goingunused at the Huntsville base.andP;  &quot;We tested it for compatibility and had thewhole thing running in about 90 days,&quot; he said.andM;The Army is adapting an Air Force military payroll system that employssimilar technology, Owens said.andP;  Civilian payroll differs from militarymainly because civilians have more options as to how they are paid and whatbenefits they select Massman said.andM;Massman said Pyle's front-end system is being used at about 40 smallerlocations in the Army.andP;  At Fort Sam Houston in Texas, Army finance andaccounting experts are testing &quot;an interactive pilot program where you'd havejust one central program&quot; for the entire Army, Massman said.andP;  He describedthe pilot program as similar to the Redtore system but without the localmainframes.andM;In the meantime, Defense Department experts from across the services andagencies of DOD are examining the overall requirements for civilian pay aspart of the corporate information management plan.andM;Several Pentagon officials have said the Navy's civilian payroll system isthe early favorite to be the standard interim system DOD officials willimpose if interim systems are chosen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
