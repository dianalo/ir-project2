A survey included in the report, released Wednesday, also foundthat juries decided heavily in favor of employees, returningverdicts for the workers in 72 percent of cases between 1985 and1988.   ``Employee privacy issues are destined to be the labor law issueof the 1990s as they continue to be fueled by controversies overworkplace drug testing, AIDS, workplace monitoring of job functionsand management responses to family issues,'' said the authors of theBureau of National Affairs report, lawyers Ira Michael Shepard,Robert L. Duston and Karen S. Russell.   Their Washington employment law firm of Schmeltzer, Aptaker andamp;Sheppard conducted the 50-state survey of employee lawsuits.   Duston said the 1988 invasion of privacy verdicts included casesinvolving drug and alcohol abuse, unlawful surveillance by employersand use of lie-detector tests. The average award was $375,307.   ``A substantial new array of complex and novel legal theorieshave developed under which employees are attempting to redress whatthey see as a decline in their privacy rights,'' the report said.``The United States is forging the cutting edge of employee privacyrights.''
