The critical coupling at m/sub q/ = 0 is estimated to be {beta}/subc/ = 6/g/sub c//sup 2/ = 5.29 - 5.32, and the physical scale of T/subc/{approx_equal}(0.19-0.24)m/sub p/. Deconfining phase transition takesplace simultaneously with the chiral transition. Preliminary resultsfor quark-antiquark potential derived from Polyakov line correlationsare also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
