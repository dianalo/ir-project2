Post owner Peter Kalikow gave the paper a reprieve lateFriday, allowing the Newspaper Guild to vote on asalary-slashing proposal that calls for a four-day work weekand 20% cut in pay. The Guild, which represents reporters,editors, and advertising staff, is expected to approve theproposal, under pressure, if only to save the jobs of otherunion members.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kalikow, who has lost $80 million on the Post in twoand a half years, vows to close the paper immediately if theproposal is not ratified tonight at a 6 p.m. meeting.   The 189-year-old Post has lived by the sword and it coulddie by the sword. Its trademark brand of journalism is rarelyseen anymore in American newspapers: a rough-and-tumble,street-wise style, that mirrors both the passions andprejudices of a polyglot New York readership. Headlineclassics such as &quot;Headless Body In Topless Bar,&quot; &quot;Shark EatsMan Alive,&quot; and &quot;Best Sex I Ever Had&quot; have played well in NewYork.   New Yorkers may yet see more of these hard-to-forgetheadlines. But industry consultants, analysts, and even othertabloid publishers, say the Post's incendiary, blood-and-gutsbrand of tabloid newspaper has quickly become an anachronism.   Even in the hands of its current editor, thetough-talking, glib Jerry Nachman, a Brooklyn native whovirtually personifies a city tabloid editor, the Post'scirculation has sunk to desperate lows. Circulation oncesoared under then-owner Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s.Bolstered by readers sweepstakes and tantalizing crimestories, Post circulation reached 962,000 in 1983; for thesix months ended March 31, Post circulation has dropped 6%from a year earlier to 504,000. Circulation at New York's&quot;upscale market&quot; papers, New York Newsday and the New YorkTimes, both moved up in the same period.   Considered a mass-market crowd pleaser, tabloid-stylejournalism has rarely been a winner in the last two decades.Mr. Murdoch tried it in Chicago with the Sun-Times, gainingreaders but losing advertisers. The Toronto Sun PublishingCorp. bought and transformed the Houston Post into a racy tabin the early 1980s, after which the Post lost valuable marketshare to the cross-town rival Houston Chronicle. In bothcities, new owners were faced with toning down the racystyle, usually to regain lost advertisers.   In St. Louis, Ingersoll Publications Co. created a newtabloid in the fall of 1989. Less sensational than most,Ingersoll's St. Louis Sun played up crime, hired combativecolumnists, and kept a conservative political stance, all acounterpoint to Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s St. LouisPost-Dispatch, the entrenched broadsheet. The Sun set afteronly seven months due to high delivery cost, lacklusterstreet sales, and lack of consistent advertising from St.Louis' most prestigious advertisers.   &quot;Demographic shifts are against papers like the Post,&quot;said James Dolan, a former Sun-Times executive and now amedia investment banker with Jordan Group. &quot;The people mostlikely to read a newspaper today are least likely to beinterested in what tabloids have to offer. The traditionaltabloid reader gets what he wants from TV.&quot;   Even if the Post were winning over legions of new readers,it would present a dilemma, according to John Morton,newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones andamp; Ryan. WhileMr. Murdoch boosted circulation with games like Wingo, thePost's share of the New York advertising market remains low.&quot;If you are losing money on every copy sold, the more yousell the more you lose because of increased paper anddistribution costs,&quot; said Mr. Morton.   Mr. Kalikow hired magazine editor Jane Amsterdam in 1988to raise the paper's &quot;journalistic standards and practices.&quot;She played down the sensational sex stories and played upinvestigative pieces. For a brief time, uptown departmentstores took ads in the Post. But after run-ins with Mr.Kalikow over editorial direction, Ms. Amsterdam left a yearlater, succeeded by Mr. Nachman.   &quot;The problem is the ad market has targeted a whole othergroup of reader,&quot; said Ms. Amsterdam.   Tabloids are by no means dead, but they are being updatedfor baby boomers.   Times Mirror Co.'s New York Newsday straddles the linebetween gritty street news and full coverage of the arts andmagazine-length feature stories. In Pawtucket, R.I., RobertJelenic, chief executive of Journal Register Co., whichincludes the U.S. papers once belonging to Ralph Ingersoll,plans a tabloid-style remake of the Evening Times, but with adifference.   &quot;You can't get by today just on pretty girls on page 3 andcrime stories,&quot; said Mr. Jelenic. &quot;You must have opinionatedcolumnists, good reporters, and you gotta break stories.&quot;   Under Mr. Nachman, the Post has done its share of that,breaking some of the biggest stories of the year in New YorkCity. In an interview Saturday, however, Mr. Nachman said &quot;itwon't be easy&quot; publishing the Post with reporters and editorson four-day work weeks.   Mr. Nachman vows not to be the last editor of the New YorkPost. &quot;The Post is like the Vietcong,&quot; he said. &quot;You shootthem . . . but they get back up and spray you with machinegun fire . . . . the Post has a history of overcoming allsorts of baroque obstacles.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
