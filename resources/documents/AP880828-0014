DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tropical depression 50 miles east of Miamidrenched parts of the Bahamas Saturday, and hurricane expertspredicted the poorly organized system would turn north Sunday.   Forecasters said East Coast residents from the middle of Floridato North Carolina should monitor progress of the system.   ``If it stays close to the coast it's going to be difficult forit to become better organized than it is now,'' National HurricaneCenter forecaster Gil Clark said. ``The biggest threat is over theeastern Bahamas, where they have these squalls.''   The hurricane center canceled a tropical storm watch for theBahamas late Saturday, and rain was expected to taper off overnight.   Early Sunday, the system was 40 miles east of Palm Beach, movingto the northwest at 10 to 15 mph. It was expected to turn to thenorth over the next 12 to 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds in thedepression were near 35 mph.   ``It never has been organized,'' Clark said. ``It's kind oflopsided _ all the (bad) weather's on the east side. We're notgetting anything on the west side. We don't know why. Sometimesthat happens.''   The depression caused at least three deaths and forced hundredsof evacuations due to swollen rivers and mudslides as it movedacross the northern edge of the Caribbean on Friday. No injuries orflooding were reported Saturday.   Up to 5 inches of rain was expected in the Bahamas as thedepression, the seventh of the 1988 Atlantic Ocean hurricaneseason, crossed the islands.   ``It's pretty miserable over here,'' said Roger Carron, co-ownerof The Tribune in Nassau. ``We're having a lot of rain. It's acrossto Andros. In other words, the whole country seems to beblanketed.''   In Cuba, the official news agency La Prensa said Friday thatcivil defense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousandsof people to higher ground.   The depression, which began forming last Sunday in the centralAtlantic, dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in a 24-hourperiod ending Thursday and then dropped 5 inches more on theDominican Republic.   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in twoseparate accidents Wednesday, and more than 100 homes around theisland were damaged by flooding, Civil Defense officials in PuertoRico reported. They also reported mudslides and damaged highwaysand bridges.   If the lopsided depression should attain tropical-stormstrength, it would be called Chris. Two other tropical storms havedeveloped during the season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, butno hurricanes.   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when theirmaximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, and become hurricanes whenmaximum sustained winds hit 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
