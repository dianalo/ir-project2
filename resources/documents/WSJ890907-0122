The sales were the Fed's largest intervention in a three-month period since the central bank began its quarterly tallies in 1973.    The previous largest intervention occurred from November 1978 through January 1979, when the bank bought just under $6.8 billion to arrest the dollar's free fall. The previous record for dollar sales was $3.2 billion in August-October 1985.    The extraordinary amount of dollar sales in the latest period reflects intense upward pressure on the U.S. unit, rather than any change in Fed policy, said Sam Y. Cross, executive vice president of the New York Fed.    &quot;The period showed we were prepared to do a substantial amount of intervention . . . to respond to market pressures {for a higher dollar},&quot; Mr. Cross said.    The bulk of the sales took place in May and June, when the Fed bought yen for $7.24 billion and bought West German marks for $4.68 billion.    In the February-April period, the Fed's dollar sales totaled around $2.2 billion.    Fed officials cited several factors for the dollar's bull run during May and June. The currency's relatively solid showing in the early part of 1989, buoyed by investment and commercial demand, persuaded many investors to increase the share of dollar assets in their portfolios and quelled moves to hedge against the possibility of weakness in the U.S. unit.    This, occurring despite narrowing interest-rate differentials, added a decidedly pro-dollar flavor to the market. The dollar's advance intensified after mid-May, when the government reported a smaller-than-expected jump in U.S. consumer prices for April and a bullish report on the U.S. trade deficit for March.    Concerned with the dollar's climb, the White House warned on May 22 that the dollar's sustained appreciation could upset international trade balances. But, by May's end the upward pressure on the dollar had abated somewhat in the face of aggressive central-bank intervention and signs that the pace of the U.S. economy was slowing.    The dollar, however, resumed its ascent in early June as Asian investors sought a safe-haven currency following the Chinese government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.    By late June, the market shifted its focus back to the U.S. economy and monetary policy, casting a cautious patina over the market.    The dollar closed the three-month period virtually unchanged, as measured by a trade-weighted basis against a basket of currencies. During the period, the U.S. currency rose 3% against the yen, 0.75% against the mark and 1.25% against the British pound.    Regarding persistent market talk that the Fed has adopted more secretive intervention techniques, Mr. Cross said, &quot;At times we may operate more visibly in the market. . . . At other times we may think it's more effective to operate less openly.&quot;    The Fed and the U.S. Treasury, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, participated equally in the quarter's interventions. </TEXT></DOC>
