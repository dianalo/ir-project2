But Mr. Deng also made it clear that Beijing isn't aboutto ease the political repression that it has maintained inthe same period.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Reforms and greater openness {to foreign trade andinvestment} are China's only way out,&quot; Mr. Deng was quoted assaying by the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper in Hong Kong.&quot;No reform is a dead end.&quot;   The report and others like it emanating from Mr. Deng'sweeklong visit to Shenzhen, a booming free-trade zone on theborder with Hong Kong, appear to confirm that Mr. Deng, 87years old and infirm, is pushing the Communist Party toresume economic reforms that had been frozen, or in somecases reversed, since mid-1989.   In the Chinese way of doing things, Mr. Deng's comments,made at meetings with local officials in Shenzhen andGuangdong province, amount to a directive that partyofficials end their bickering over reform and support theadoption of capitalist methods to stabilize the falteringsocialist economy. His statements foreshadow a reformistvictory over supporters of Stalinist central planning at aparty congress later this year. Any Chinese officials whodon't support the &quot;new thinking&quot; on economic reform wouldhave to step down, Mr. Deng was quoted as saying.   Mr. Deng specifically praised the &quot;successful&quot; stockmarkets in Shenzhen and Shanghai. &quot;If capitalism hassomething good, then socialism should bring it over and useit,&quot; Ta Kung Pao quoted him as saying. As a further sign ofeasing, China recently allowed foreigners to buy shares onits two stock markets and committed itself to making theChinese yuan a fully convertible currency.   The return to a more pragmatic economic stance appears toreflect a consensus among China's aging leadership that thespread of market economics within the socialist system is theonly way to prevent communism from collapsing, as it did inthe former Soviet Union. At the same time, Beijing apparentlyalso has decided that former Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev's loosening of political control, or glasnost, isas dangerous to continued Communist rule in China as inMoscow.   Earlier, as reported in Ta Kung Pao, Mr. Deng had urgedChinese security forces to aid in economic development whileremaining alert to the dangers of &quot;bourgeois liberalism,&quot; acatch phrase referring to Western ideas, such as democracy,seeping into China. Analysts took that to mean politicalrepression would continue despite the economic easing.</TEXT></DOC>
