Reversing six years of solid bipartisan support, theSenate voted by a surprisingly large 54-44 margin toeffectively bar deployment of any proposed space-basedanti-missile system for at least a decade -- and probablymuch longer. Lawmakers for the first time imposed strictspending limits and long-range priorities on the program'svarious technologies, thereby frustrating Bush administrationhopes of beginning in the next few years to put up thousandsof small rockets -- dubbed Brilliant Pebbles -- designed toprovide a shield against Soviet or Third World missiles.</LP><TEXT>   While still earmarking $3.67 billion for the overallresearch program, now called the Strategic DefenseInitiative, the vote nevertheless reflects fundamentalchanges in Congress's fiscal and strategic view of the world.Despite loud complaints from the Pentagon, strong objectionsfrom Senate Republican leaders and even hints of a veto, theSenate essentially decided to turn the program into anotherlong-term research effort -- one that most likely will beforced to fight further cuts year after year.   &quot;We're still fighting the . . . Cold War with Reaganrelics,&quot; asserted longtime SDI critic Sen. Tom Harkin (D.,Iowa), &quot;and SDI is the biggest relic of them all.&quot; Sen. JeffBingaman (D., N.M.) who led the fight to reshape theprogram's goals, complained during the debate that lawmakersover the years gave SDI managers &quot;a blank check&quot; because itremained &quot;the only area in the defense budget {lacking}direction from Congress.&quot; Before the vote, Sen. Bingamanblasted the Pentagon for pursuing &quot;the craziness&quot; of seekingearly deployment.   SDI's problems have been building for a long time. Sincethe mid-1980s, Pentagon brass have shifted gears severaltimes as to what would be the most effective network ofspace-based and land-based interceptors. Congressionalinvestigators and Air Force auditors have complained aboutinadequate financial controls. Just last month, the SenateArmed Services Committee's report on the authorization billfor the fiscal year starting in October complained thatmembers don't &quot;endorse an arbitrary deadline&quot; embraced by theWhite House for shifting Brilliant Pebbles from thelaboratory into space.   But above all, the Senate's turnabout was evident in thecomments of moderate and pro-defense Democrats, includingSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),who steadfastly has supported the Pentagon on the issue butthis time voted to clip its wings. &quot;No one can tell you wherethe money is coming from, and yet they're charging straightahead&quot; toward deployment, Sen. Nunn said.   Even the Senate's rejection of amendments calling fordeeper overall SDI spending cuts is likely to be ashort-lived victory for the White House. Support for theprogram is considerably weaker in the House, which couldreduce SDI funding to about $2 billion for next fiscal year.The administration requested nearly $4.7 billion for fiscal1991, but even supporters conceded that SDI outlays wouldhave to climb to twice that level by the mid-1990s in orderto seriously consider deploying actual hardware.   Leading the battle for the administration, Sen. MalcolmWallop (R., Wyo.) said too many lawmakers are &quot;in absoluteterror of coming to grips with the reality . . . of buildingreal systems to help real people.&quot; The new restrictions onthe program, he said, ensure that &quot;near-term promises will beput on the shelf for long-term promises, which will then beput on the shelf again for longer-term promises.&quot;   Sen. Bingaman and Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), theother leading proponent of restructuring the program, contendthat their approach is the only way to retain robust SDIfunding. But the administration and its congressionalsupporters have noted that laboratories and researchfacilities in the two states Sens. Bingaman and Shelbyrepresent are bound to benefit the most from the changes.   The defense bill, approved by bleary-eyed senatorsSaturday afternoon after they slogged through more than 100amendments and came back to the Senate floor following amarathon session lasting into the early morning hours, alsoreaches out in some other new directions. Paving the way forthe deepest cuts in military spending since the end of WorldWar II, the measure withholds production or full-scaledevelopment money for four of the Pentagon's major aircraftprograms, seeks to cut 100,000 troops from the active-dutyforce by the fall of 1991, and leaves in limbo furtherspending on mobile MX missiles and the Navy's superquietSeawolf attack submarines.   The bill also continues production of the B-2 Stealthbomber if the plane passes radar-eluding tests. And itprovides the most extensive proposals since the mid-1960s toenhance reserve forces and provide medical, financial andother assistance for officers and troops being forced out ofthe military for budget reasons. The Senate also rejectedefforts to limit spending on anti-satellite weapons, mothballadditional battleships, and shift money from the Pentagon fordrug treatment and other social programs.</TEXT></DOC>
