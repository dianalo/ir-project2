The official China Daily said food retail prices had not risensince December, but acknowledged that huge government subsidieswere a main factor in keeping prices down.   The State Statistical Bureau, in a survey of 28 major cities,found that more than $270 million was spent in the first half ofthe year for pork subsidies, and another $54 million for vegetables.   The daily quoted experts as saying the growing subsidies willcause the difference between prices and real values of commoditiesto ``become very unreasonable.'' That will cut the amount of fundsavailable for investment.   The austerity program was imposed last fall, when the governmentcut off credit to companies outside the state plan, suspended newbuilding projects, cut public spending and reasserted centralcontrols over key industries and trade.   Conservatives solidified their control after the June militarycrackdown on pro-democracy protesters. They support centralplanning, are reluctant to tackle economic reforms and stresspublic ownership.   The lot of small industries and private businessmen has becomeincreasingly difficult.   The austerity measures were designed in part to control economicgrowth, which soared to 20.7 percent last year to 8 percent in1990. Economists predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 percentand retail sales will be up only 15 percent, compared to a 27.8percent jump in 1988.   The Customs Administration said restrictions on imports werepaying off. China recorded its first trade surplus of the year inSeptember, with exports exceeding imports by $345 million on totaltrade of $9.19 billion.   Inflation has almost leveled off and retail prices were up 18.5percent in the first six months of 1989. Inflation in urban areaswas well above 30 percent last year.   The government has yet to solve the problem of factories beingforced to turn to high-priced free markets for basic materials thestate is unable to supply.   Production costs were up 20.2 percent in the first eight monthsof the year _ an 8.9 percent increase over the same period in 1988_ because of continued supply-demand imbalances.   The State Planning Commission and other ministries complainedrecently that many state-run factories, staggered by rising costs,are selling their goods on the more profitable free market ratherthan to the state.   Smaller, locally run firms, which have provided the Chineseeconomy with its punch in recent years, have been hit hard by thewithdrawal of credit and many are being forced out of business.   The closures have added to the unemployment crisis in thecountryside, where small industries have provided 100 million jobsin the past decade.   People are reluctant to return to the land, which already facesa labor surplus. Tens of millions have drifted into the cities tolook for construction work and menial jobs that have dried up underthe austerity plan.   The government continues to pour large amounts of money intolarge state industries, many of which are overstaffed, inefficientand uncompetitive. The bank said total debt owed by state firms tobanks and other enterprises has reached $29.3 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
