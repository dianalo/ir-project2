<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0874 </DOCNO><TEXT>The usefulness of intravenous DSA has been established. With refinementsin instrumentation the indications will expand. However, the limitationsof the technique have also been noted. It is clear than intravenous DSAwill not replace invasive catheter arteriography, nor will it necessarilyreplace the noninvasive tests such as transcutaneous Doppler and Duplexultrasound, plethysmography, etc. Perhaps, potentially, the most usefularea for digital subtraction techniques is augmentation of arterial injectionof contrast material. These studies demonstrate that digital subtractiontechniques can markedly reduce the volume of contrast material injected,reduce procedure time and costs of the study, and increase safety asless contrast material is needed to visualize the vessels. As discussed,evaluation of the cerebral vasculature may in particular, benefit usingdigital filming techniques. Evaluation of hand ischemia with semiselectiveinjection of contrast material into the subclavian artery may prove sufficientfor adequate study. Similarly, significant improvement in evaluationof the pedal arch for lower-extremity ischmia may be obtained with asemiselective injection into the femoral artery. It is in these typesof studies that digital subtraction angiography has been most usefulfor them and in which the authors feel much of its future promise lies.</TEXT></DOC>
