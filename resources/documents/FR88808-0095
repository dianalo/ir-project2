B. RobinsonSteam Electric Plant, Unit 2. The license provides, among other things,that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of theNuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.</ITAG>Section 103(c)(2) to 10 CFR Part 20 requires a determination by a physicianat least once every 12 months that an individual is physically able touse the respiratory protective equipment in an environment containing airborneradioactive material.By letter dated January 30, 1986, the licensee requested an exemption from10 CFR 20.103(c)(2) with regard to the interval for the administrationof a physical examination for users of respiratory equipment. Specifically,the licensee requested an exemption to permit the physicals to be administeredat an interval of every 9 to 15 months rather than the currently scheduled8 to 12 months. In support of its request, the licensee notes that theexemption would provide greater flexibility in scheduling of examinationsand would preclude the need for administration of two examinations in thesame calendar year.The acceptability of the exemption request is discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.</ITAG>In order to satisfy the 10 CFR 20.103(c)(2) requirement of ``at least onceevery 12 months,'' the licensee has to administratively schedule the physicalexaminations every 8 to 12 months because of the large number of workersfor whom these examinations have to be scheduled. Therefore, over a periodof a few years, a substantial number of workers would receive two physicalexaminations within one calendar year. This would result in an unnecessaryexpenditure of the licensee's resources. On the other hand, according tothe licensee's proposed schedule of a physical examination of every 9 to15 months, it would be possible for a worker to average fewer than oneexamination every year over an extended period of time, for example, onlyfour examinations in five years. This practice clearly does not meet theintent of the regulation.In order to provide the licensee with administrative flexibility and yetmeet the intent of the regulation to provide one physical examination everyyear, the staff has determined that an exemption to 10 CFR 20.103(c)(2),as requested by the licensee, with a provision that the total time overany three consecutive physical examination periods will not exceed 39 months,should be granted.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.</ITAG>The Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.501, this exemptionis authorized by law, and will not result in undue hazard to life or property.Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants an exemption related to the timeinterval requirement of 10 CFR 20.103(c)(2) on physical examinations from``at least once every 12 months'' to ``every 9 to 15 months, provided thatthe total time over any three consecutive physical examination periodsdoes not exceed 39 months.'' Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission hasdetermined that granting this exemption will have no significant impacton the environment (53 FR 25553).<ITAG tagnum="21">This exemption is effective upon issuance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven A.
