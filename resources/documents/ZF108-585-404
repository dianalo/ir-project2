 At least that's what an increasing number of developers and end usersbelieve about the applications they've produced in HyperCard, Apple'squasi-object-oriented multimedia program.andM;On the other hand, Apple naturally wants to protect its proprietarytechnology.andP;  One of the key selling points for the Macintosh in recent yearshas been HyperCard, which Apple rightfully considers a strategic product.andP;  Tothat end, the firm has applied for and expects to receive both patent andcopyright protection on several aspects of the program.andM;The patent covers several aspects of the way HyperCard compresses anddecompresses bitmap images.andP;  Although the patent hasn't been issued yet, thePatent Office has advised Apple that the claims in Apple's patent applicationhave been accepted.andP;  As with any other patent, it carries the exclusive rightto use that method, even if others later discover it completelyindependently.andM;In addition to the normal literary right secured for most computer programs,Apple has also received registration of an audio-visual copyright on the&quot;look and fee&quot; of the HyperCard interface.andP;  According to Apple, thoseprotections are sufficiently encompassing to forbid any program from readingor writing HyperCard stacks unless licensed by Apple.andP;  Furthermore, says anApple statement, licenses will only be granted for applications that run onApple platforms.andP;  Moreover, with an object-oriented system, it's often hardto disentangle the tools from the product.andM;That issue will be coming to the fore over the next few months as severalHyperCard-like software construction kits arrive for DOS and UNIX users.andO;Although many users want to be able to move objects, routines and wholestacks back and forth freely--just as we now routinely move word processingdocuments, spreadsheets and even still images among platforms --Apple's legalstance poses a potential hitch in that process.andM;Fortunately, it looks like the worst-case scenario is not going to come topass.andP;  While Apple insistent that other firms recognize its legal rights inthis matter, the firm has apparently decided not to use those claims tocreate an absolute barrier against object migration.andM;Two MethodsandM;As of this month, there are at least two announced methods for bringingHyperCard stacks and objects across that Apple appears to have foundacceptable.andP;  Stacks can be read directly by the Macintosh version ofSpinnaker Software Corp.'s Plus (a HyperCard compatible program originallydeveloped in Germany and now slated for Windows, OS/2 and UNIX versions aswell).andP;  And Heizer Software expects to publish next month a program developedby the HyperMedia Group called ConvertIt!, which will translate HyperCardstacks into their closest equivalent in Asymetrix's Toolbook program forWindows.andM;David Seuss, a president of Spinnaker, says that if Apple's patents andaudiovisual copyrights are valid -- and Spinnaker has no plans to challengethose protections -- then Plus falls in an area where Apple claims exclusiverights.andP;  According to Spinnaker's legal counsel, there should not be anyproblem, Seuss adds.andP;  However, a non-disclosure agreement forbid furtherexplanation, he says.andM;At the Apple end, we find the answer to this paradox.andP;  According to Apple,the German firm that developed the program, Plus Gmbh., is one of less than adozen Apple HyperCard technology licensees.andP;  Mike Holm, Apple HyperCardproduct manager, says that although he won't endorse the Spinnaker product,he's not going to object to it either.andM;&quot;I'm not the legal department, but I don't believe Apple has any basicproblem with [Spinnaker's] business strategy,&quot; he said.andP;  As long as only thelicensed version running on the Mac reads the HyperCard files and does thetranslation to Plus's own file format, there should be no problem if otherversions of Plus then run those translated files.andM;The absence of a legal barrier doesn't solve all compatibility problems.andO;Given the lack of an standard sound chip, Plus for non-Mac platforms won't beable to handle HyperCard's sounds; XCMDs (external commands) will have to berecompiled or rewritten for the new platform.andP;  But Spinnaker does expect thatthe Windows version will be able to call on MacroMind's forthcoming Windowsplayer for Director sequences and animations.andM;HyperCard reads HyperCardandM;CompileIt!'s approach is conceptually similar, but uses HyperCard itselfrather than a licensed program to extract the data from HyperCar's protectedfile formats.andP;  The program, which is being developed by The HyperMedia Group,a multimedia production and development company, and distributed exclusivelyby Heizer, will use HyperCard to read stacks and write an equivalent in aprogram-independent format to be called HIFF (Hypermedia Information FileFormat).andM;A second translator for Asymetrix's Toolbook program will then read that HIFFfile and convert it to the closest possible Toolbook approximation.andP;  Asdemand warrants, says Senior Partner Tay Vaughan, the Hypermedia Groupintends to write further translators for other hypermedia programs.andM;Using HyperCard itself to read HyperCard programs avoids any legalentanglements, Vaughn points out, but that's only one reason for theintermediate file format strategy.andP;  Because their firm works with so manyhypermedia tools, they wanted a strategy that allows maximum reusabilty oftheir tools.andP;  They also wanted to create a human-readable intermediate filebecause some degree of editing may be needed when translating betweenmachines or programs with very different feature sets.andM;Lastly, with an intermediate file it's easier to add new classes of objectsin the future.andP;  Although the first version will cover only those objects thatmight have to be moved from HyperCard to Toolbook, in the future the languagecan be extended to other type of multimedia objects.andM;CompileIt! is scheduled for July delivery with a price of $199, reports BrianMolyneaux, Heizer's hypermedia products manager.andP;  The manual will include afull description of the HIFF structure.andP;  Other developers will be encouragedto use it.andM;What does it mean?andM;One of the lessons of the last dozen years is that software that usesmultimedia technologies and better user interfaces can ease the task ofcomputer users -- but developing programs with such rich environments takes alot of extra work.andP;  In addition, the programming skills needed aren'tnecessarily possessed by people who have been working in more traditionalenvironments.andM;Consequently, there's going to be a large payoff to organizations that canmultiply their development efforts across platforms and leverage the skillsof their trained programmers.andP;  Being able to use HyperCard stacks acrossmultiple platforms could be a significant advantage in the case of multimediafront ends and user-written applications.andM;At his point, it looks like we will be able to share procedures and scriptsacross platforms.andP;  But to complete the process, we'll still need standardsfor sharing sound, video and access to external multimedia devices.andM;[Heizer's involvement is notable, due to the fact that it's a unique softwarehouse.andP;  The company has focused on relatively small, inexpensive pieces ofspecialized programming, such as spreadsheet macros, utilities, HyperCardstacks and others.andP;  Selling primarily by mail order, Heizer has come throughsome very lean times.andM;But the company's position as a distributor of softwar &quot;modules&quot; that workwithin other programs is a strategically intriguing one as softwar itselfbecomes incrasingly modular.andP;  The small chunks of code that Heizer sells justwon't go through the retail channel -- their prices are simply too low tosupport ordinary distributor and dealer margins.andP;  Yet they're more valuableand higher quality than software that's distributed via bulletin boards andother shareware distribution.andM;We expect Heizer to prosper as new products is such as HyperCard, Toolbook,SuperCard and Plus gain wider acceptance, and more familiar spreadsheets anddatabases become more customizable.andP;  Today, even word processors, such asMicrosoft Word, are customizable!andP;  Heizer is worth watching to understand atleast one way that software add-ons will be distributed in the future.andM;We've been working with Toolbook for a couple of months and we're impressedwith its utility as a way to knock out a custom application or prototype veryquickly.andP;  That's been a big hole in the DOS environment.andP;  Toolbook has nicedevelopment and debugging tools.andM;We're not as impressed with its performance, even on a fast '386 system.andP;  Itsupport color, however, which brings a big performance penalty.andP;  Weanticipate that future versions will focus on performance.andM;One of HyperCard's strengths was the ease with which the programming languagewas learned.andP;  Although Toolbook's language bears some of the samecharacteristics of readability, it's much more complex -- or at least appearsso from the documentation -- than HyperTalk.andP;  However, there are many, manypeople who've already been programming on DOS systems, who will pick upToolbook programming quickly.andP;  We're not so confident that it'll attract asmany new programmers as did HyperCard.andM;No doubt, Toolbook will be very successful in the next few years.andP;  But don'texpect an abrupt fast spike.andP;  It'll be a while before there's a substantialinstalled base of machines the the processing power to make Toolbook runsmoothly.andP;  Meanwhile, the DOS community will probably have just as muchtrouble figuring out what it is as Mac users did with HyperCard.andP;  Toolbookhas the advantage of being second, though.andP;  All of those potentiallyconvertible HyperCard stacks will help DOS users understand the conceptquickly, which is good news for HyperCard developers as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
