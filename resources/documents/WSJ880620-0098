The loan would carry an annual interest rate of 4.9% and run over a 16-year period, the magazine said in today's edition. The government's guarantee allows better terms than East Germany could otherwise obtain.    Separately, the state secretary in the economics ministry in charge of the aircraft industry, Erich Riedl, said in an interview in today's edition of the newspaper Die Welt that he expects the signing of the sales contract with Interflug within the next two weeks.    Last week, Western industrial nations agreed to allow the sale of commercial airliners to communist countries under certain conditions, according to French officials. The accord, reached within the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, is expected to be approved at a Cocom meeting this week. </TEXT></DOC>
