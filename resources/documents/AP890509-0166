Carlin hascharged in a civil suit that his successor, Albert V. Casey,participated in a scheme to unseat him at the behest of a Texascompany seeking a $400 million contract.   Carlin's $5 million suit charges that Casey, who was postmastergeneral for seven months in 1986, lent his name and prestige to aneffort by Recognition Equipment Inc., to obtain a sole-sourcecontract to produce electronic ZIP code scanning equipment.   The Dallas-based company and two of its executives, William G.Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy, are awaiting trial here onconspiracy charges stemming from an alleged scheme to influence thecontract award in which $19,000 was paid to Postal Service governorPeter Voss.   Casey is not charged in the criminal case but the indictmentmaintains that the alleged contract-rigging scheme included aneffort to replace Carlin with someone REI considered moresympathetic to its effort to sell the Postal Service $400 millionworth of optical-scanning equipment.   Casey's Washington attorney, Hamilton P. Fox, said Tuesday thathis client had no knowledge of REI's interest in a contract beforehe became postmaster general.   ``The grand jury has investigated this thing. There is just noevidence at all to support that allegation,'' Fox said.   There was no answer at Casey's office in Dallas.   Carlin's lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court here, isthe latest in a series of civil actions in the wake of thethree-year investigation that so far has yielded three convictions.   Voss is among three people who have pleaded guilty in connectionwith the investigation and is cooperating with prosecutors.   Carlin claims that Casey is liable for civil damages under theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act but does notcharge that he participated in the bribery scheme.   Carlin's suit recites bribery allegations contained in othercriminal cases against REI, Moore, Reedy and others.   The suit charges that Casey ``was aware of REI's difficulties inobtaining a sole-source Postal Service contract'' because of hisfriendship with Robert Crandall, a former American Airlinespresident who was a director of REI.   By taking the job, Casey was ``lending himself and his prestigeto the conspiracy to obtain a contract for REI, and thus to furtherthe interests of the conspirators by doing their bidding after hjsappointment.''   The suit also alleges that at Voss's behest, Casey removed JamesV. Jellison as deputy postmaster general. Jellison was viewed byREI as another obstacle to the company's contract proposal.   Jellison, who retired rather than accept another job in thePostal Service, has filed a separate lawsuit that, among otherthings, charges Casey with infliction of emotional distress.   Carlin claimed in the lawsuit that his abrupt replacement byCasey damaged his reputation. ``The stop-gap nature of Casey'stenure left the inference that he was taking the job ... because ofsome situation involving Carlin personally, when in fact there wasno such situation or emergency.''   Last week, the Justice Department filed a civil suit againstREI, claiming damages arising from the alleged contract-riggingscheme. The company has also been sued by several shareholders'groups.</TEXT></DOC>
