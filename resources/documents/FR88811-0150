This action is needed toenable FmHA to clarify its EM loan regulations and provide certain administrativeguidelines to fully comply with the provisions of existing laws and regulations.The intended effect is to facilitate this action to prevent untimely delayin providing EM disaster loan assistance to eligible family farmers indisaster areas declared by the President or designated by the Secretaryof Agriculture.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Glenn J.

Thereis no major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographical region orsignificant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or in the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Comments</ITAG>On January 15, 1987, FmHA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 1706) a proposed rule giving interestedparties until February 17, 1987, to submit comments. On February 18, 1987,FmHA published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 4913), extending the comment period toMarch 19, 1987, upon requests from the public. In response to the proposedrule 168 comments were received from individuals, FmHA employees, special-interestgroups, United States Congressmen and State government officials. Fifty-eightof the comments were copies of very similar letters. Some of the letterscovered a broad range of subjects. Generally, the comments addressed thegeneral subject matter rather than a specific part of a regulation. Therefore,we will discuss all of the comments which are related to various subjectsof this final rule action as follows:1. Require a positive cash flow and provide guidance for determining familyliving expenses and a reserve for risk and uncertainties.The proposed rule added the term ``positive cash flow'' with the requirementof a reserve for taxes, meeting scheduled payments on all debts, open accountscarryover debts, and a reserve for major repair costs.The comments expressed concern over these added requirements: the proposedrequirements were vague and require clarification regarding what were majorrepairs, reasonable standard of living, and essential capital purchasesor improvements; does the proposal require a reserve for payment of nextyear's taxes?; FmHA borrowers are not in a strong enough financial positionto maintain such reserves; capital reserves based on depreciation are notfeasible for FmHA borrowers; and if borrowers could meet these additionalrequirements, they would not need FmHA credit.In view of the comments, we have amended the proposed rule to require afeasible plan, rather than a positive cash flow, as defined in andSection;1924.57(c)(5) of Subpart B of Part 1924 of this chapter. Unlike a positivecash flow, a feasible plan shows the borrower's ability to (a) pay farmoperating expenses and taxes due during the crop year; (b) meet scheduledpayments on all debts, including open accounts and carryover debts; (c)provide for risk and uncertainties associated with the farming operation;and (d) provide living expenses for the farm family or wages for an entity-typefarm operator. This amendment is adopted here to provide uniformity inthe FmHA Farmer Program regulations.We believe these amendments address the major concerns of the commentson this subject.2. Add more guidance on what is a nonfarm enterprise.This action would further clarify which enterprises are classified as nonfarmenterprises.One comment was received on this subject. The comment suggested that thenonfarm enterprise should be located on the farm or adjacent to the farmor be closely associated with the farming operation. Many nonfarm enterprisesneed a location that is readily accessible to the consumer. Often thisneeds to be at a location other than the farm if it is to be successful.Therefore, FmHA adopts the proposed amendment.3. Clarify the EM disaster designation procedure.The major concern of the comments received on this subject was that a disasteris determined on a county-wide basis rather than on an individual farm-by-farmbasis. This is not true. The regulations in andSection; 1945.6(c)(3)(iii)(C)provide that the Secretary has discretion to find that a natural disasterhas occurred in a county when as few as a single farmer has suffered asevere production loss from a disaster. Therefore, FmHA does not believeany change to the proposed amendment is needed on this subject. The FederalEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration(SBA) pointed out several discrepancies and inconsistencies in the regulationsas related to their agencies and FmHA. After direct consultation with theseagencies, the proposed rule was amended to correct these discrepanciesand inconsistencies in the final rule.4. Require financial information from all members of an entity and deletethe references to principal members.Presently only principal members are required to submit financial information.A principal member is identified as having either a ten percent interestor more or twenty percent interest or more in the business, depending onthe type of loan program.The proposed rule required all members of an entity to pledge all theirassets for the FmHA loan. Also, the proposed rule for EM loans requiredthe sale of non-essential assets and that all members of an entity derivemore than 50 percent of their total income from the farming operation.The comments received strongly objected to these requirements. In considerationof the comments, we have dropped the requirement of pledging all assetsand the 50 percent requirement regarding farm income in this final rule.However, to strengthen the test for credit, we will require financial informationfrom all members of the entity as prescribed in Subpart A of Part 1910of this chapter.5. Clarify calculations for EM actual loss loans, and prevent duplicationof benefits from other agencies.These revisions are intended to clarify the calculations for EM actualloss loans under FmHA Instruction 1945-D and to prevent duplication ofdisaster benefits from other Government agencies, such as the Small BusinessAdministration (SBA).As discussed in item number three above, FEMA and SBA pointed out severaldiscrepancies and inconsistencies as related to their agencies and FmHA.These items are being corrected in this final rule. One comment suggestedthat when the normal year's production is calculated, all the years thatwere classified as disaster years should be eliminated from the calculationrather than just one year out of five. The comment indicated that theirarea had disasters for three of the last five years for peaches. We believethis is an indication that it is a high risk crop and that the disasteryears are the norm for the area and that optimum yields should not be used.Therefore, we are not adopting this suggestion.The program/activity of this action is listed in the catalog of FederalDomestic Assistance under No. 10.404.For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to notice 7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, this program/activity is excludedfrom the Scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with the State and local officials.The significant changes are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52"><T3>PART 1945_EMERGENCY</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Disaster Assistance_General</ITAG>In addition to the revisions of the proposed rule covered in item 3 underthe discussion of comments, this regulation has been revised to cite newdefinitions of ``Major Disaster'' and ``Presidential Emergency'' declarations,provide guidelines for preventing duplication of benefits to EM borrowersby SBA and FmHA, and make editorial changes for clarification. A summaryof the changes are as follows:Section 1945.2 has been partially revised to clarify the purpose for whichEM loans will be made available to eligible farmers suffering the effectsof disasters.Section 1945.5 has been made partially revised to add FAC_``Food and AgricultureCouncil''; change CEB (USDA County Emergency Board) and SEB (USDA StateEmergency Board) to LFAC (Local Food and Agriculture Council) and SFAC(State Food and Agriculture Council), respectively; and change SRS to NASS_``StateStatistical Office of the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.''Section 1945.6 has been partially revised to redefine ``farmers,'' ``Majordisaster'' and ``Presidential emergency''; and to include definitions of``Primary county,'' ``contiguous county'' and ``Disaster area(s)''; andto make editorial changes to the definitions of ``Normal year's dollarvalue'' and ``Termination date.''Section 1945.18 has been partially revised to reflect the USDA Food andAgriculture Councils and their functions in the disaster designation process,show that ASCS State Executive Directors serve as the Vice Chairpersonsfor Emergency Programs of the SFACs, and to make reference to FEMA's ``disasterapplication centers'' rather than ``disaster assistance centers.''Section 1945.19 has been partially revised to clarify how physical lossloans are made available by the FmHA Administrator, and to make properreferences to the LFACs, SFACs and the SFAC ``Vice'' Chairpersons, EmergencyPrograms, as the sources for assessing and reporting a potential naturaldisaster(s).Section 1945.20 (a)(2)(iii) has been revised to require the FmHA StateDirector to coordinate the issuance of all public announcements on Presidentialdisaster declarations with FEMA's Public Information Officer; paragraph(b)(2)(i) to make reference to SFAC ``Vice'' Chairperson; and paragraph(b)(2)(iii) has been revised to require the State Director to provide alist of agricultural commodities produced in the State, giving averageyearly prices for three years preceding the disaster, and county averageyields for five years preceding the disaster; and proper reference is madeto NASS instead of SRS.Section 1945.21 (b)(5) has been revised to show the weekly reporting requirementsof County Supervisors to the FmHA State Director and to FEMA when 408 grantsare made available to victims suffering damages and losses to housing andpersonal property in Presidential major disaster areas.Section 1945.25 has been revised to show proper references to the SFAC``Vice'' Chairperson(s) and FEMA's disaster ``application'' center(s);and to show that FmHA's ``Report of Emergency Loans Made Pertaining toDisasters'' will be provided quarterly to FEMA's National Office by theFmHA National Office.Section 1945.26 has been partially revised to provide guidelines to preventthe duplication of FmHA and SBA disaster loan benefits; and to specifyweekly rather than daily reporting to FEMA of EM applications receivedin Presidential disaster areas; and to submit to FEMA a copy of the final(rather than each) action taken on the EM applications. The reference tothe SBA Administrator is corrected to show the Secretary of Agricultureor FmHA Administrator.Section 1945.28 has been added setting forth the relationship between ASCSand FmHA under their respective disaster programs.<ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart D_Emergency Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations</ITAG>Some of the revisions to the proposed rule are covered in items 3 and 5in the discussion of comments. Part of the introductory paragraph for andSection;1945.162 was inadvertently dropped in the proposed rule and is added inthis final rule. This is a provision of the Food Security Act of 1985 forcontrolled substances. The proposed rule for andSection; 1945.163 (b)(6)(i)through (v) was revised in the final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 1, 1987. This revision was in regardto replacement costs for EM loan physical losses. The proposed rule forandSection; 1945.184 is deleted from this final rule because it has beendetermined not to be in the best interest of the Government to make EMloans to FmHA employees. A summary of the revisions are as follows:This regulation has been revised to remove certain provisions which arenow obsolete, make editorial changes and clarify EM loan security requirements.This revised instruction includes changes for calculating quality productionlosses, household content losses, losses to livestock operations, and physicallosses to growing crops. It also provides examples on how to calculatelosses for informative purposes.Section 1945.154 has been partially revised to include definitions forfarm and home plan, household contents, feasible plan, and irregular payment;make cross reference to andSection; 1924.57 (c)(5) of Subpart B of Part 1924of this chapter for definition of a feasible plan; delete definitions offarmer and principal members, stockholders, partners and joint operators;revise definitions of borrower, established farmer, farm, farming enterprise,nonfarm enterprise, partnership, physical loss, and production loss; andto change the abbreviation ``EFP'' to the correct abbreviation of ``EFAP''_EmergencyFeed Assistance Program.Section 1945.155 has been revised to delete reference to an obsolete Memorandumof Understanding between SBA and FmHA.Section 1945.156 has been partially revised to delete references to principalsof entity applicants and establishes uses of monies from sale of non-essentialassets.Section 1945.161 has been partially revised to make editorial changes,and to delete references to principals of entity applicants and the enumeratedinformation required from entity applicants and members of entity applicants.Section 1945.162 has been partially revised to delete ``principal'' andclarify the eligibility requirements for an ``established farmer'' in paragraph(c), change paragraph (g) to coincide with the training and experiencerequirements of other farm loan regulations, correct the cross-referenceof the definition of a ``family farm'' in paragraph (i), make editorialchanges in paragraph (1), and to add paragraph (m).Section 1945.163 has been partially revised to clarify and renumber paragraphs(a)(1) (i) through (v) to (a)(1) (i) through (iv) to set forth the sourcesof production records which may be used in sequential order to calculatethe applicant's normal yields; provide guidelines and examples on calculationof production losses in paragraph (a)(2); provide guidelines and examplesfor calculation of replacement cost to essential machinery, equipment andbuildings in paragraphs (b)(5), (7) and (8); allow applicants with dwellinglosses only the option to apply for either an EM loan or SBA disaster housingloans in paragraph (b)(14); provide guidelines for determining householdcontent losses in paragraph (c); and editorial changes are made in paragraphs(d) and (e).Section 1945.166 has been partially revised to clarify paragraph (a)(2)and to reduce and clarify the number of purposes for which EM funds maybe used in paragraphs (b) and (c).Section 1945.167 has been partially revised to add paragraphs (b), (j)and (k) and renumber the existing paragraphs accordingly.

Any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood,high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcaniceruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought, fire, explosion, orother catastrophe in any part of the United States which is of such magnitudethat the President makes a declaration requiring Federal emergency assistanceto supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property,public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. (3) <T3>Natural disaster</T3>. A disaster in any part of the United Statesin which unusual and adverse weather conditions or other natural phenomenahave substantially affected farmers by causing severe physical propertylosses and/or severe production losses within a county. Except where otherwisespecified, the use of the term county or similar political subdivisionis for administrative purposes only.   (i) Unusual and adverse weather conditions or natural phenomena includesuch things as:  (A) A major single natural occurrence or event such as a blizzard, cyclone,earthquake, hurricane or tornado.  (B) A single storm, or series of storms, accompanied by severe hail, excessiverain, heavy snow, ice and/or high wind.  (C) An electrical storm.

(ii) Severe <T3>physical</T3> property losses are those which the Administrator determinesprior to a natural disaster determination by the Secretary, to be severe,and to have caused extensive damage to or destruction of, physical farmproperty including farmland (except sheet erosion); structures on the landsuch as buildings, fences, dams, etc.; machinery, equipment, and tools;livestock, livestock products; poultry; poultry products; growing crops(see andSection;1945.163(b)(11) of Subpart D of Part 1945 of this chapter);harvested crops, and supplies which, if not repaired or replaced, wouldmake it impossible for farmers affected by the unusual and adverse weatherconditions to continue operating their farms on a sound basis.  (iii) Severe <T3>production</T3> losses within a county are those in which either: (A) The Secretary determines that there has been a reduction countywideof at least 30 percent of the normal year's dollar value of all crops,including hay and pasture, and the crops could not be replanted or replacedwith a substitute crop, or  (B) The Secretary determines that there has been a 30 percent loss countywidein the normal year's dollar value of a single enterprise (as defined inandSection;1945.154(a)(13)(i) of Subpart D of Part 1945 of this chapter);or  (C) The Secretary, after exercising discretion, determines that, althoughthe conditions set forth in andSection;1945.6(c)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of thissubpart have not been met, the unusual and adverse weather conditions ornatural phenomena have resulted in such significant production losses,or have produced such extenuating circumstances as to warrant a findingthat a natural disaster has occurred. In making this determination, theSecretary may request the Administrator to provide for consideration suchfactors as the nature and extent of production losses; the number of farmerswho have sustained qualifying production losses; the number of farmersin that other lenders in the county indicate they will not be in positionto finance; whether the losses will cause undue hardship to a certain segmentof farmers in the county; whether damage to particular crops has resultedin undue hardship; whether other Federal and/or State benefit programs,which are being made available due to the same disaster, will consequentlylessen undue hardship and the demand for EM loans; and any other factorsconsidered relevant. The Secretary will consider the information set forthin andSection;1945.6(i) of this subpart in deciding whether a natural disasterhas occurred.  (4) <T3>Potential natural disaster</T3>.

(h) <T3>Normal year's dollar value</T3>. The FmHA National Office will determinethe normal year's dollar value by establishing a normal year yield andprice. Normal year yield will be the average yield of the 5 years immediatelypreceding the disaster year for each cash crop, including hay and pasture,grown in the county. The price will be the average commodity price forthe 36 months immediately preceding the disaster year for each crop. Yieldsand prices used to establish the value or normal production will be obtainedfrom the NASS. In cases where crops produced and/or prices are not availablefrom NASS, the information will be obtained from other reliable sources.Yields used to establish the disaster year's production will be obtainedfrom DARs which are prepared by the LFACs and SFACs. Prices used to establishthe value of disaster year production will be the same as those used toestablish normal year values.(i) <T3>Substantially affected. </T3>A farmer applicant has been substantiallyaffected when there has been a disaster as defined in paragraph (c) ofthis section, and the applicant has sustained qualifying physical and/orproduction losses, as defined in andSection; 1945.154(a) of Subpart D ofPart 1945 of this chapter.

(b) <T3>Responsibility for assessing and reporting disasters. </T3>USDA SFACsand LFACs representing their members agencies are best qualified at theState and County levels to accomplish the assessment of agricultural productionlosses resulting from a potential natural disaster. These councils arecharged with the responsibility of reporting the occurrence of and assessingthe damage caused by disasters and will perform this responsibility underpolicies and procedures as set forth in the EOH. (c) <T3>Actions to be taken. </T3>Immediately after the occurrence of a potentialnatural disaster: (1) When physical losses only occur, the FmHA County Supervisor will reportto the State Director who will advise the Administrator that there hasbeen a potential natural disaster with physical property losses to oneor more farmers. <T3>This report must be made to the Administrator within 3 months fromthe last day of the disaster incidence period. Upon receiving the report,the Administrator will decide whether a natural disaster has occurred.If it has, the Administrator will make EM loans available to any otherwisequalified applicant who has suffered qualifying physical losses. Availabilityof EM loans assistance under this Administrator action shall be limitedto physical losses only. </T3>Notices that EM loans are available willidentify the county in which the unusual and adverse weather condition,or natural phenomenon has occurred and also each contiguous county. (2) When physical and/or production losses occur, the FmHA County Supervisorwill report to the LFAC chairperson, as specified in the EOH, all substantialphysical property loss, damage or injury and severe production losses thathave occurred in the County Office area. The County Supervisor will assistthe LFAC in preparing the 24-hour report required in paragraph (c)(3) ofthis section. If the LFAC has not completed its 24 hour report within twoworkdays after the occurrence of a potential natural disaster, the CountySupervisor will report to the State Director of Form FmHA 1945-27, ``Reportof Natural Disaster.'' In urgent situations, the report may be made bytelephone, followed by the LFAC report or Form FmHA 1945-27. Either ofthese reports will be based on information obtained from personal knowledgeand from farmers, agricultural and community leaders, and from any otherpersonally contacted reliable source(s). The County Supervisor will conveyto the LFAC chairperson all information pertaining to the potential disasterand provide the chairperson with a copy of Form FmHA 1945-27, if prepared.(3) The LFAC will report the potential natural disaster, in accordancewith the EOH, to: (i) The SFAC, Vice Chairperson; and (ii) Appropriate County Government representative(s). (4) The SFAC will provide copies of the LFAC report to: (i) The USDA Washington Offices of ASCS, FmHA and Office of IntergovernmentalAffairs; and (ii) The State Governor's Emergency Coordinator and the State Departmentof Agriculture.

Reductions in the productionof livestock and livestock products, or reductions in weight gains of animalsdue to homegrown feed crop and/or pasture losses, will not be consideredproduction losses when replacement feed is available to purchase, regardlessof the cost of that feed (normally production losses to livestock enterpriseswill be based on feed crop and pasture losses). When the disaster has severelydisrupted the usual feeding schedule of a livestock enterprise becauseof extended utility failure or inaccessibility to the livestock, lossesin production of milk, eggs, weight losses, etc., may be considered asproduction losses. Production losses will be calculated based on the reductionfrom normal which occurs during the disruption period and the period neededto bring production back up to the normal level.(32) <T3>Related by blood or marriage.</T3> As used in this subpart, individualswho are related to one another as husband, wife, parent, child, brotheror sister.(33) <T3>Security.</T3> Property of any kind subject to a real or personal propertylien.

If the applicant has been getting credit away from thelocal community where the farming operation is located, such source(s)of credit must also be contacted and considered. The applicant's equityin <T3>all assets,</T3> including, but not limited to, real estate, chattels,stocks, bonds, and Certificates of Deposit will be considered in determiningthe applicant's ability to obtain such credit from other sources. Also,the applicant must offer to pledge <T3>all assets</T3> as security when requesting credit from other lenders.Cooperatives, corporations, partnerships and joint farming operations andthe members, stockholders, partners and joint operators, both individuallyand collectively, must be unable to provide the required financing fromtheir own resources or with credit obtained from pledging those resourcesto other lenders. Form FmHA 1940-38, ``Request for Lender's Verificationof Loan Application,'' must be completed (with particular attention thatItem 2A is completed) and filed in the applicant's County Office case folder;and any additional facts concerning the findings, <T3>in all cases,</T3> must be documented and recorded in the running caserecord.(2) <T3>Test for credit certification requirements.</T3> Applicants will certifyin writing on the application form, and the County Supervisor <T3>shall</T3> make the determination whether or not adequate and suitablecredit is available elsewhere to finance the applicant's actual needs atreasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing privateand cooperative rates and terms in the community in or near which the applicantresides for loans for similar purposes and periods of time. The CountySupervisor will consider all such information obtained from other lendersin making the determination, but is required to make an independent decisionconcerning the applicant's ability to obtain the needed credit elsewhere.Should the County Supervisor determine that the applicant <T3>can</T3> obtain the necessary credit elsewhere to meet actual needs,the applicant will be notified, in writing, that the applicant is <T3>not</T3> eligible for an EM loan(s).(i) For applicants whose total EM loan(s) request is for $300,000 or less,the following actions will be taken:(A) Applicants will be required to apply for the credit needed from theirnormal lender(s) and, if their normal lender(s) is located outside thelocal community, from at least one agricultural lender in the local community,to determine whether such lender(s) will provide the credit. Form(s) FmHA1940-38 must be completed by all lending sources contacted, unless an exceptionis made under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.Only when the applicant is not able to obtain a loan, from one or moreof the lending sources contacted, will the applicant be considered foran EM loan. If the County Supervisor believes it necessary, the actionrequired in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be taken.(B) When the County Supervisor receives letters or other written evidence,including Form FmHA 1940-38, from a lender(s) indicating that the applicantis unable to obtain satisfactory credit from that source(s), such correspondencewill be included in the loan docket.  (C) If it appears from a review of the application that it would be undulyburdensome for the applicant to obtain written declinations of credit fromother lenders, the County Supervisor may make an exception to this requirement,provided the County Supervisor is familiar enough with other lenders' farmloan programs to determine that no possibility exists for the applicantto obtain the credit needed from those lenders. When this conclusion isreached, the basis for it will be recorded in the running case record,and further checks will not be necessary. However, when this exceptionis used, the applicant's normal lender(s) <T3>must be contacted in all cases</T3> and the results of that contact(s)must be well documented in the running case record.  (ii) For applicants whose total EM loan(s) request is for more than $300,000,the following actions will be taken:  (A) Applicants will be required to apply at not fewer than three conventionallending sources, including the Production Credit Association or FederalLand Bank, as appropriate, in the local community. In addition, when anapplicant has a net worth of $1 million or more and produces evidence thatthe necessary credit cannot be obtained in the local community, the applicantwill be required to contact at least two other lending sources outsidethe local area. One or more of those lenders contacted must be the applicant'snormal lender(s).  (B) Form FmHA 1940-38 must be completed by all lending sources contacted,returned to the County Office and handled in accordance with paragraph(b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.  (C) When the County Supervisor receives Form FmHA 1940-38 indicating thatthe applicant is unable to obtain satisfactory credit, the forms will beplaced in the loan docket. However, such evidence will not preclude theCounty Supervisor from contacting other farm lenders in the area and makingan independent determination of the applicant's ability to obtain creditelsewhere.  (3) <T3>Use of nonessential assets (both farm and nonfarm) when seeking othercredit</T3>. When an EM loan(s) will be made, after other lenders havedeclined to provide needed credit to the applicant, the County Supervisor<T3>will</T3>, as a condition of loan approval, require the applicant andthe owner(s) of the applicant entity to list all assets (both essentialand nonessential) setting forth: Why those assets and any income derivedfrom them are needed; and how such assets and the income derived from themwill be used for essential family living expenses and for maintaining asound family farming operation(s). The loan approval official must determinethat the applicant's plan for use of <T3>all</T3> assets and the income derived there-from is acceptable. Anyassets not contributing to essential family living expenses and maintenanceof a sound family farming operation <T3>will</T3> be considered nonessential; and the applicant and the owner(s)must, as a condition of loan approval, agree to sell the nonessential assets.The proceeds from such sale(s) <T3>will</T3> be used to reduce the amount of EM loan(s) requested, providedthe assets can be sold prior to the EM loan(s) closing. If the nonessentialasset(s) cannot be sold before loan(s) closing, the ownership interestin those assets <T3>will</T3> be mortgaged and/or assigned to FmHA; and a written agreementprepared and executed, in a manner approved by the OGC, to sell those assetsat their present market value, within a specified period not to exceedone year from the date of loan(s) closing. The proceeds from the sale ofsuch assets will be applied as an extra payment on the FmHA loan carryingthe lowest interest rate, which is secured by the asset(s) sold.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection;1945.157_1945.160</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1945.161</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Receiving and processing applications.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Applications</T3>.

(3) Applications may be received and processed from FmHA EM loan borrowersor SBA disaster housing loan borrowers for that portion of the maximumEM loan originally authorized, but not requested initially from FmHA orSBA, provided the application is <T3>received within 8 months of the disaster declaration/determination/notificationdate</T3>.(4) Applicants who are determined to be <T3>ineligible </T3>for an EM loan may be considered for other types ofFmHA farm loans, when appropriate.(b) <T3>Statement of losses. </T3>Applicant's statements of loss or damagewill be obtained in support of their applications by having them completeForm FmHA 1945-22, ``Certification of Disaster Losses.''(c) <T3>ASCS verification of farm acreages, production and benefits. </T3>Frominformation obtained on Form FmHA 1945-22, the County Supervisor will senda separate Form FmHA 1945-29, ``ASCS Verification of Farm Acreages, Productionand Benefits,'' to the appropriate ASCS County Office for verificationof ASCS registered farm(s) that the applicant has certified constitutedpart of the disaster year's operation. ASCS records of acres of crops planted/grownin the disaster year, actual (proven) yields in the disaster year, ASCSestablished yields for the disaster year, ASCS emergency payments and theother information requested on that form must be obtained. The use of FormFmHA 1945-29 is optional for EM loans made for physical losses. It is requiredfor EM loans made for production losses on crops covered by ASCS programs.(d) <T3>Evidence of operation. </T3>If the applicant is a cooperative, corporation,partnership, or joint operation, it will provide evidence that it was operatingas a cooperative, corporation, joint operation or partnership at the timethe disaster loss occurred, or has changed its form in accordance withandSection; 1945.162(1) of this subpart, after the loss occurred.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.162</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Eligibility requirements.</ITAG>In accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) afterDecember 23, 1985, if an individual or any member, stockholder, partner,or joint operator of an entity is convicted under Federal or State lawof planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting or storing a controlledsubstance (see 21 CFR Part 1308, which is Exhibit C to Subpart A of Part1941 of this chapter and is available in any FmHA office, for the definitionof ``controlled substance'') prior to loan approval in any crop year, theindividual or entity shall be ineligible for a loan for the crop year inwhich the individual or member, stockholder, partner, or joint operatorof the entity was convicted and the four succeeding crop years. Applicantswill attest on Form FmHA 410-1, ``Application for FmHA Services,'' thatas individuals or that its members, if an entity, have not been convictedof such crime after December 23, 1985. A decision to reject an applicationfor this reason is not appealable. In addition, the following requirementsmust be met:(a) <T3>Test for credit. </T3>Applicants must be unable to obtain sufficientcredit elsewhere to finance actual needs at reasonable rates and terms,taking into consideration prevailing private and cooperative rates andterms in the community in or near which the applicant resides for loansfor similar purposes and periods of time.(b) <T3>Citizenship. </T3>(1) An individual applicant must be a citizen ofthe United States (see andSection; 1945.154(a) of this subpart for the definitionof ``United States'') or an alien lawfully admitted to the United Statesfor permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliensmust provide Forms I-151 or I-551, ``Alien Registration Receipt Card.''Indefinite parolees are not eligible. If the authenticity of the informationshown on the alien's identification document is questioned, the CountySupervisor may request the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)to verify the information appearing on the alien's identification cardby completing INS Form G-641, ``Application for Verification of Informationfrom Immigration and Naturalization Records,'' obtainable from the nearestINS District Office. (See Exhibit B of Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapter.)The completed form will be mailed to INS. The payment of a service feeby FmHA to INS is waived by inserting in the upper right hand corner ofINS Form G-641, the following: ``INTERAGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST''.(2) More than a 50 percent interest in the cooperative, corporation, partnershipor joint operation must be owned by United States citizens (see andSection;1945.154(a) of this subpart for the definition of ``United States'') oraliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence underthe Immigration and Nationality Act.(c) <T3>Established farmer. </T3>An applicant must be an established farmer(as defined in andSection; 1945.154(a) of this subpart). An applicant whoconducts the farming operation as an individual must manage the farmingoperation. At least one stockholder, member, partner or joint operatorof an entity applicant must manage the farming operation. One who doesnot devote full time to the farming operation may be considered the managerprovided that person visits the farm at sufficiently frequent intervalsto exercise control over the farming operation, makes decisions and givesdirections on how the operation(s) should be run, and sees that the operationis being carried on properly. Any applicant that employs an outside full-timehired manager or management service does not qualify as an establishedfarmer, regardless of the number of visits made by the individual applicantor the members, stockholders, partners or joint operators. The followingare not considered to be established farmers for EM loan purposes:(1) An estate or trust; a corporation with over 50 percent of the ownershipheld by an estate, trust, another corporation, a partnership or a jointoperation; a partnership or joint operation with over 50 percent of theownership held by an estate, trust, corporation, another partnership oranother joint operation.(2) Integrated livestock, poultry, and fish processors who operate primarilyand directly as commercial businesses through contracts or business arrangementswith farmers. However, a grower under contract with an integrator or processoris considered an established farmer even though the applicant operatesthrough a contract arrangement with an integrated processor, provided theoperation is not managed by an outside full-time hired manager or managementservice. Farmers operating through contract may be considered for EM loansfor physical losses and production losses. However, eligibility for andthe amount of their production losses will be determined from the applicant'sshare of the agricultural production as set forth the contract.(d) <T3>Operate in a disaster area. </T3>An applicant for an EM loan must havesustained qualifying losses in an area in which the availability of EMloans for actual losses has been determined in accordance with SubpartA of Part 1945 of this chapter; and must have filed an application beforethe expiration date. When an applicant's farming operation is located bothin a designated county(ies) and a non-designated county(ies) refer to andSection;1945.163(a)(2)(xx) of this subpart.(e) <T3>Losses. </T3>An applicant must have suffered qualifying productionand/or physical losses to be eligible for an EM loan. Production lossesmust be to property in which the applicant has an ownership interest orinterest in which a security interest can be obtained. Physical lossesmust be to property in which the applicant has an ownership interest. SeeandSection; 1945.163 of this subpart for the methods of determining qualifyinglosses.(f) <T3>Legal capacity. </T3>An applicant must possess the legal capacity tocontract for the loan.(g) <T3>Training and experience. </T3>An applicant must have sufficient applicabletraining or farming experience in managing and operating a farm or ranch(within 1 of the last 5 years immediately proceeding the application) whichindicates the managerial ability necessary to assure reasonable prospectsof success in the proposed plan of operation and have the character (emphasizingcredit history, past record of debt repayment and reliability), and industrynecessary to carry out the proposed operation.(h) <T3>Honestly endeavor. </T3>The applicant will honestly endeavor to carryout the undertakings and obligations required of the applicant in connectionwith the loan.(i) <T3>Family farm. </T3>The applicant's farm must be a family farm as definedin andSection; 1945.4 of Subpart A of Part 1941 of this chapter. If the applicantwas conducting larger than a family farm at the time of the disaster butwill be conducting a family farm at the time an EM loan is closed, theapplicant meets this eligibility requirement.(j) <T3>Intent to continue farming. </T3>An applicant must show an intent tocontinue the operation after the disaster. Those applicants who were requiredto stop temporarily because of the disaster loss or damage to their operationsbut intend to continue farming with EM loan assistance meet this requirement.(k) <T3>EM loan(s) to cooperatives, corporations, joint operations or partnerships.</T3>When an EM loan is made to a cooperative, corporation, partnershipor joint operation, only one initial EM loan can be made to the entityconstituting the farming operation to cover the losses per disaster. However,an individual member, stockholder, partner, or joint operator may qualifyfor a separate EM loan to cover losses to a <T3>separate farming operation </T3>which the applicant conducts as anindividual on a different farm tract.(1) If the members, stockholders, partners or joint operators holding amajority interest <T3>are related </T3>by blood or marriage, at least one member, stockholder,partner or joint operator must operate the family farm.(2) If the members, stockholders, partners or joint operators holding amajority interest <T3>are not related </T3>by blood or marriage, the majority interest holdersmust operate the family farm.(3) If an entity applicant has an operator interest in any other farmingoperation, that farming operation must be no larger than a family farm.(l) <T3>Change in the form of an applicant. </T3>A change in the form of anapplicant between the time of a qualifying loss and the time an EM loanis closed does <T3>not </T3>make the applicant ineligible for EM loan assistance. (Examplesof changes in form are as follows: An entity may split into its individualmembers or into more than one entity; one or more individuals may leavean entity; an individual may incorporate; a partnership may become a jointoperation, a corporation, a cooperative, or another partnership; a corporationmay become a partnership, a joint operation, a cooperative, or anothercorporation; a cooperative may become a joint operation, a partnership,a corporation, or another cooperative; a joint operation may become a partnership,a corporation, a cooperative or another joint operation.) Such an applicantis eligible for EM loan assistance subject to <T3>all </T3>of the following limitations and qualifications:(1) The applicant must meet all FmHA eligibility requirements at the timeof loan closing.(2) The applicant must <T3>not </T3>conduct an operation larger than the operation that was beingconducted at the time of the disaster.(3) In the case of an entity applicant, all of the individuals who havean interest in the entity must have had an ownership interest (or an interestin which a security interest could be obtained) in the farming operationat the time of the disaster and/or must be heirs of those who had an ownershipinterest (or an interest in which a security interest could be obtained)in the farming operation at the time of the disaster. Heirs must have beenparticipating in the operation at the time the disaster occurred and mustbe engaged in the farming operation at the time of loan approval.(4) In the case of an individual applicant, that person must have had anownership interest (or an interest in which a security interest could beobtained) in the operation at the time of the disaster and/or must be anheir of those who had an ownership interest (or an interest in which asecurity interest could be obtained) in the operation at the time of thedisaster. An heir has to have been participating in the operation at thetime the disaster occurred and has to be engaged in the farming operationat the time of loan approval.(5) To determine the amount of an actual loss loan an applicant may receive,first calculate the actual loss suffered by the operation(s) as it existedat the time of the disaster, in accordance with andSection; 1945.163 of thissubpart. Then look at the individual applicant <T3>or </T3>the individual members, stockholders, partners or joint operatorsof an entity applicant and determine each person's percentage of ownershipinterest (or interest in which a security interest could be obtained) inthe operation as it existed at the time of the disaster. For an entityapplicant, add the percentages of all owners who had an interest in theentity that suffered the disaster losses. Multiply the actual loss sufferedby the operation as it existed at the time of the disaster by this percentagefigure; the result is the amount of actual loss loan the applicant mayreceive. For example, if one partner withdraws from a four-partner partnership(each person owning a 25% interest), the remaining three partners are eligiblefor 75 percent of the actual loss suffered by the operation as it existedat the time of the disaster.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.163</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Determining qualifying losses, eligibility for EM loan(s) and themaximum amount of each. </ITAG>Disaster losses will be reported by applicants on Form FmHA 1945-22,``Certificationof Disaster Losses,'' which states the physical and production losses sufferedas a result of the declared/designated disaster. The applicant will report,on Form FmHA 1945-22, total acres and actual yields for <T3>all </T3>crops planted and/or grown in the disaster year, and the numberof <T3>all </T3>animal units and production per animal unit being maintainedat the time of the disaster. This information will come from the applicant'sown records or from ASCS records of acres grown and proven actual yieldsin the disaster year. Applicants will also report their previous 5-yearproduction levels as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. This formwill be completed and submitted to the County Office with the application,as soon as the losses and/or damages can be accurately assessed. The informationprovided by applicants on Form FmHA 1945-22 will be the primary basis forFmHA's calculation of qualifying losses, eligibility for EM loan(s) basedon production losses, and an applicant's maximum amount of EM loan eligibility.Therefore, applicants are required to certify, subject to penalties oflaw, that the accuracy and completeness of the information provided onForm FmHA 1945-22 can be supported by written records. Applicants willbe asked to identify on that form any single farming enterprise they considerbasic to the success of their total farming operation, and in which theyhave suffered a disaster loss. When an applicant's certified productionloss claims seem unreasonable, they will be verified and the findings documented.Physical loss claims will be verified by requiring the applicant to furnishevidence of ownership and proof of the property loss or damage. Proof ofownership could be by deeds, mortgages, financial statements, insurancepolicies, and the like. Proof of the loss or damage could be by the applicant'sown pictures, written certification by other persons or, when practical,by visual inspections by FmHA employees. (a) <T3>Production losses. </T3>(1) The normal year's production will be establishedby eliminating the poorest year of the 5-year production history immediatelypreceding the disaster year and averaging the remaining 4 year's production.The applicant <T3>must </T3>select the year to be eliminated. The year selected to beeliminated <T3>must</T3> be the same year for all farm enterprises (i.e., <T3>all </T3>crops, livestock, and livestock products), which constituteda part of the applicant's farming operation during that year. A State supplementwill be issued which will be used in connection with paragraph (a)(1)(iii)of this section. The State supplement will contain average production figuresprovided by the USDA State Crop and Livestock Reporting Service, when available.If those records are not available, the State supplement will contain statisticaldata on production from similar State or Federal bodies. When this informationis available by county, county averages will be used. If available onlyby State, the State averages will be used throughout the State. In thoseStates where neither a Country nor State average is available for an agriculturalcommodity(ies), the State Director, with the advice of representativesof other Federal and State agricultural agencies, will establish Countyor State averages and advise County Offices of these averages in the Statesupplement. State Directors and Farmer Programs Chiefs in adjoining Stateswill consult with each other before releasing these figures. Applicantswill identify, on Form FmHA 1945-22, the production record source(s) tobe used in determining the normal year's production for each commoditythat was produced on all farms operated by the applicant in the disasteryear. Applicants must use the production record source(s) for each cropin the order of priority as follows: (i) <T3>The applicant's actual reliable farm records or ASCS ``actual yields,''</T3>for those years for which they are available. When the ASCS ``actualyields'' are used, they will be documented on Form FmHA 1945-29. If actualyields are not available for all of the 5 crop year(s), the applicant willfirst use a combination of actual records which are available and the ASCSestablished yield(s) for the disaster year, as specified in subparagraph(ii). If ASCS established yields are not available for the disaster year,then the applicant will use a combination of actual records which are availableand County or State averages, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii). (ii) <T3>The ASCS ``established yields.'' </T3>When this production record sourceis used, the applicant must obtain the information from ASCS and submitit with the application to FmHA. The disaster year established yield, asprovided by ASCS for any given crop, will be used as the yield for thoseyears for which actual yields are not available and combined with actualyields to determine the normal year's yields. When there are no actualyields available for any of the 5 years, and there is an ASCS establishedyield available for the disaster year, the established yield will be consideredas the normal year's yield, without any calculations. This production recordsource will be used only for those years and those commodities for whichthe applicant's or ASCS actual yields are not available. (iii) <T3>The County or State average yields. </T3>These average yields willbe found in the State supplement mentioned in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection. This production record source will be used only for those commoditiesand those years for which neither the applicant's reliable farm recordsnor ASCS actual or established yields are available. Only when there areno ``actual yields'' or ``established yields'' available will County orState average yields be used. However, County or State average yields maybe combined with actual yields when established yields are not available,but County or State average yields will not be combined with establishedyields when established yields are available for the disaster year. (iv) When an applicant's production loss is on land being developed andmaximum production capacity has not been attained, the State Director willestablish normal yields on a case-by-case basis. (2) FmHA loan official(s) will complete Form FmHA 1945-26, ``Calculationof Actual Losses.''(i) In calculating production losses, the same established unit priceswill be used for the disaster year and the normal year in computing thedollar value of each enterprise. Unit prices will be established in accordancewith paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section. In the production loss calculation,those crop production yields and production per animal unit records authorizedin paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this section will be used. (ii) Information certified on Form FmHA 1945-22 for the disaster year forall single enterprises (as defined in andSection; 1945.154(a)(13)(i) of thissubpart), which suffered a loss due to the disaster, will be transposedfrom Form FmHA 1945-22 to the appropriate places on Form FmHA 1945-26.The FmHA official completing Form FmHA 1945-26 is responsible for veriftyingloss information provided by the applicant. Information obtained from ASCSon Form FmHA 1945-29 will be cross checked with information provided bythe applicant on form FmHA 1945-22. Whenever there is a discrepancy betweenan applicant's acreage and/or yield information provided on Form FmHA 1945-22,by the applicant, and the information provided by ASCS on Form FmHA 1945-29,the applicant will be told about the discrepancy and the applicant andthe County Supervisor will complete Form FmHA 1945-22 so that it accuratelyreflects the applicant's average and yield. (iii) When the applicant's disaster loss is due to a reduction in <T3>quality </T3>with or without a quantity loss, rather than a reductionin <T3>quanity </T3>only, the applicant will be given credit for quality lossby adjusting the actual production yield downward. This will be accomplishedby converting the dollar value of the quality loss to a yield reductionequal in value to the quality loss. When a quality adjustment is necessary,the basis used in making the adjustment will be the applicant's <T3>accurate </T3>records of production and sales receipts showing theactual price received and the grade of the commodity for the five yearsimmediately preceding the disaster year. The normal year's quality willbe established by eliminating the poorest of the five-year record. Theapplicant must select the year to be eliminated. The burden of providingthis information rests with the applicant.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example I: </T3>A farmer has accurate records indicating that the farmer'snormal year's production of corn is 100 bushels per acre of No. 2 corn.Due to flooding after the ears were set and mature, the corn was coatedwith a filmy residue. This resulted in the quality grade being reducedfrom No. 2 to No. 3. The commodity price established for No. 2 yellow cornwas $3.00 per bushel. The farmer, due entirely to a <T3>reduction in quality, </T3>received $1.50 per bushel.

Unit prices for all agriculturalcommodities produced commercially in each State will be established ona Statewide basis by all FmHA State Directors each year, and publishedin a State supplement to be issued not later than <T3>February 15 </T3>of each year. These commodity prices will be establishedby averaging the <T3>monthly market prices of each commodity for the 12-month period precedingthe calendar year in which the disaster occurs. </T3>The monthly averagemarket prices report, ``Agricultural Prices,'' prepared by the NationalAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS), formerly the Statistical ReportingService (SRS), will be mailed to each State Office from the FmHA NationalOffice the first week of each month for the previous month. This reportprovides the average monthly prices for <T3>all major </T3>agricultural commodities produced in each State. Formajor commodities not reported monthly by NASS, State Offices will alsobe sent the NASS publication, ``Crop Values Summary.'' This publicationprovides a 3-year history of seasonal average prices, by State and UnitedStates average, for all crops of any significance produced in the 48 contiguousStates and Hawaii. Prices found in this annual publication, available byFebruary 1 of the year succeeding the year being reported, are to be usedas a <T3>guide only </T3>in establishing the annual price list of commodityprices only for those commodities for which the monthly average pricesare not reported. State Directors <T3>will </T3>consult with other agricultural agency representatives andother agricultural lenders in the local area; and State Directors and FarmerProgram Chiefs in adjoining States <T3>will </T3>consult each other for additional guidance before releasingtheir commodity price lists. Once established, these prices will not bechanged for any EM loan processed under any disaster occurring on or afterFebruary 1 of that calendar year through January 31 of the next calendaryear. These monthly and annual reports will be retained and used for referenceeach year when preparing the annual price lists of average commodity pricesto be used Statewide for calculating actual production loss values, forall disasters that occur during the ensuing 12-month period.(v) The amount of actual production loss will be calculated for the singleenterprise which is a basic part of the farming operation (see andSection;1945.154(a)(13) of this subpart) by subtracting all financial assistanceprovided through any disaster relief program and all compensation for disasterlosses provided by any source (<T3>i.e., </T3>crop insurance indemnity payments, ASCS disaster programpayments) <T3>for that enterprise, </T3>from the gross dollar amount of productionlosses for that enterprise as determined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of thissection.(vi) Actual losses for tobacco, peanuts and other crops grown under acreageand/or poundage control will not be calculated differently than any othercrop; i.e., the calculations must not include the dollar value of carryover surplus poundage from previous year's(s') production or underproducedpounds to be sold or produced in future years. The value of underproducedpoundage allotments and quotas must not be subtracted from the loss. Productionfrom all ``controlled'' crop acres planted in the disaster year, includingacreage above the producer's allotments and quotas, will be consideredeven though the carry-over crop is not eligible for price supports untilthe next marketing year.(vii) Actual losses for spring and fall annual crops of the same specieswill be treated as two separate crop losses and listed separately on FormsFmHA 1945-22 and 1945-26. The crop(s) not affected by the disaster willbe considered as having produced a normal year's yield.(viii) The dollar value of the actual production loss for the single enterprisewhich is a basic part of the farming operation as designated by the applicantin Item F, Form FmHA 1945-22, will be divided by the previously calculatednormal year's gross income for that enterprise. The result should be roundedto the nearest whole number. To illustrate, if the calculation shows a29.49 percent production loss, round it down to 29 percent. If the calculationshows a 29.50 percent loss round it up to 30 percent. This establishesthe percentage reduction in production from normal for that enterprise.If the percentage loss in <T3>any </T3>single enterprise (see andSection; 1945.154(a)(13) of this subpart)which is a basic part of the farming operation equals or exceeds 30 percent,and the applicant is otherwise eligible, EM loan assistance will be considered.(ix) Once eligibility is established, based on production losses, the totalproduction loss sustained by the applicant, directly attributable to thedisaster, is computed by adding the gross dollar amount of production lossesof <T3>all </T3>single enterprises, whether or not they constitute a basicpart of the farming operation, and subtracting from this total all financialassistance provided through any disaster relief program and all compensationfor disaster losses provided by any source for those enterprises.(x) The maximum EM loan for production losses is limited to <T3>80 percent </T3>of the total calculated actual production loss sustainedby the applicant.(xi) Production losses to hayland, pasture and rangeland used for grazinglivestock owned by the applicant must be based on the production from onlythose acres which are utilized in the disaster year. Losses may be calculatedby one of three methods when approved by the State Director. The StateDirector will decide which one of the following three methods will be usedthroughout the State to calculate losses to pasture and rangeland; andissue a State supplement to this subpart, setting forth the method(s) tobe used Statewide.(A) <T3>The price per acre method. </T3>The price per acre method is used tocalculate pasture losses in the following manner:(<T3>1</T3>) Determine the normal year's gross dollar value. To calculatethis, multiply <T3>the number of acres available to be grazed for the disaster year bythe established rental charge per acre per mongh </T3>(this figure is establishedby the State Director in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section);by <T3>the average number of months grazed per year during the highest 4 outof the 5 preceding years.</T3>(<T3>2</T3>) Determine the disaster year gross dollar value.

To calculatethis, mulitiply <T3>the number of acres grazed during the disaster year by the establishedprice per pound or ton</T3> (this figure is established by the State Directorin accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section); by<T3> the average number of pounds or tons of forage equivalent producedper acre per year during the highest 4 out of the preceding 5 years forforage of the type being used in this calculation.</T3> (The State Officewill set forth the forage equivalent values to be used or the methodologyto be used to derive this value in a State Supplement. This informationmay be set forth on a countywide or statewide basis. The State Directormay contact the State's Extension Service or other knowledgeable sourcesto assist in establishing the forage equivalent determination).(<T3>2</T3>) Determine the disaster year gross dollar value. To calculatethis, multiply <T3>the number of acres grazed during the disaster year by the establishedprice per pound or ton </T3>(this figure is established by the State Directorin accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(C)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section); by<T3> the number of pounds or tons of forage equivalent produced for forageof the type being used in this calculation produced in the disaster year.</T3>(See paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(C)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section for further information.)(<T3>3</T3>) Subtract the disaster year gross dollar value (see paragraph(a)(2)(xi)(C)(<T3>2</T3>) of this section) from the normal year gross dollar value (seeparagraph (a)(2)(xi)(C)(<T3>1</T3>) of this section) to determine the value of pasture loss duringthe disaster year.(xii) When a crop cannot be planted, an applicant may treat the loss eitheras a production loss or as a physical loss (see paragraph (b) of this section).When a crop cannot be planted and the applicant chooses to treat the lossas a production loss, the loss will be calculated as set out in this paragraphas follows: Add all income that is derived from the enterprise to the variableand fixed costs which were not incurred because of the disaster. (The costfigures will be derived from current crop enterprise budgets prepared byState Agricultural Extention Service economists, based on normal farmingconditions in the area.) Subtract this figure from the value of the normalyear's production. The resulting figure is the gross dollar amount of productionloss.(xiii) When a crop can be only partially planted due to a disaster <T3>or</T3> when perennial crops (such as fruits or nuts) already growingcannot be produced or harvested due to a disaster, the loss will be considereda production loss. Such loss will be calculated as set out in paragraph(a)(2)(xii) of this section.(xiv) When a crop is planted and completely destroyed by a disaster, ayield of ``zero'' may be shown on Form FmHA 1945-22 for the disaster yearbut only if no part of the crop could be harvested and no substitute cropcould be planted and harvested. When figuring the actual dollar amountof production losses subtract the normal costs of harvesting and marketingwhich were not incurred for crops which were completely destroyed by adisaster. If a substitute crop is planted and harvested during the samecrop year, a yield of ``zero'' should be shown for the original crop andthe actual yield for the substitute crop on Form FmHA 1945-22. On FormFmHA 1945-26, the dollar value of the substitute crop must be subtractedfrom the dollar value of the normal year's production.(xv) Losses to feed crops will be established by determining the normalyear's gross dollar value of those crops and substracting the disasteryear's gross dollar value of feed crops. The difference establishes thedisaster year's gross dollar loss for feed crops. The gross dollar valueof feed crops produced is derived by multiplying the number of feed cropacres by the yield per acre by the unit price.(xvi) When an applicant elects to sell feeder livestock at an earlier datethan usual rather than purchase feed to replace that which was lost asa result of the disaster, the difference between what the sale price wouldhave been if the livestock had been fed for the normal period and the disasteryear's premature sale price may <T3>not</T3> be claimed as a loss.(xvii) Eligibility for production losses to livestock enterprises may bebased <T3>either </T3>on loss of production in feed crops, including pasture,to be fed to the applicant's own livestock; <T3>or </T3>on loss (from normal) of weight gain of the livestock or livestockproducts produced, but <T3>not both. </T3>The value of feed produced on native rangeland and pastureconstitutes a small portion of the total input costs of maintaining a foundationherd of breeding animals and their offspring. Therefore, loan approvalofficials will calculate production losses to livestock operations basedon reductions in animal unit weight gain and natural increase in numbers.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example: </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A rancher has accurate records indicating that the rancher's 200 headfoundation breeding cow herd produced a normal calf crop average of 85percent (170 calves) with an average weaned weight of 350 pounds per calf.As a result of a drought, the rancher found it necessary to cull the cowherd by 50 cows over the normal number culled. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The predisaster value of the cows was $600 per head.

(xix) Production losses for orchard crops (fruit or nut) will be only forthe crop loss due to the qualifying disaster and determined in accordancewith paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (xx) When an applicant's farming operation(s) is conducted in a designatedcounty(ies) and a non-designated county(ies), eligibility will be establishedbased on losses to a single enterprise which constitutes a basic part ofthe farming operation, without regard to whether the single enterpriseis located in the designated county. The disaster year's <T3>actual </T3>yields, both in the designated and non-designated counties,will be used to determine losses. Compensatory payments will be subtractedas explained in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section when determining eligibility.The amount of the production loss loan will be limited to the productionloss sustained in the designated county, <T3>minus </T3>compensatory payments received or to be received for thatportion of the farming operation located in the designated county. (xxi) The County Supervisor will assign normal yields to all unplantedacreage covered by a Payment in Kind (PIK) contract, when calculating cropproduction losses on Form FmHA 1945-26. (b) <T3>Physical losses. </T3>(1) In order to qualify for an EM loan(s) forphysical losses, the damaged or destroyed physical property must be essentialto the successful operation of the farm and if not repaired or replaced,the farmer would be unable to continue operations on a reasonably soundbasis. The financing necessary to recover from the physical loss must beactually needed to permit the applicant to continue the operation. (2) The claimed value of all physical losses due to disaster damage ordestruction must be supported by written estimates for the necessary repairor replacement requested. (3) Physical loss loan funds can be used to pay for only contracted orhired labor and materials and supplies purchased. Labor, machinery, equipment,and materials contributed by the applicant or borrower will not be chargeableto the cost of necessary repair and replacement. (4) Damage to or destruction of nonessential buildings, structures or otheritems will not be repaired or replaced with EM physical loss loan funds.Any insurance compensation received or to be received for such losses willbe considered as compensation for losses to essential farm buildings, structuresand other items which need to be repaired or replaced. (5) The maximum physical loss loan(s) will be determined by subtractingall financial assistance provided through any disaster relief program andall compensation for disaster losses provided by any source from the valueof all actual physical losses caused by the disaster. (6) The physical loss for the following items equals the market value atthe time of the disaster for items lost, damaged or destroyed by or asa result of the disaster: (i) Livestock. (A) Death of an animal(s) caused by the disaster. (B) Disaster related damage to an animal's(s') health, which has impairedor reduced its normal production capability and its market value. Thisincludes forced reductions of foundation breeding stock caused by the disaster.Physical losses, under these conditions, would be calculated by establishinga dollar value per head, or unit, at the time the disaster occurred, anddeducting the reduced dollar value received from the disaster-caused saleof the animals. The difference in the two values would be considered aphysical loss. <T3>(THE ANIMALS SOLD MUST BE OVER AND ABOVE THE NUMBERS NORMALLY CULLEDEACH YEAR).</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example: </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physical loss would be calculated as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Predisaster market value_50 cowsandmultiply;$600/cow=$30,000 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Price received for cull cows_50 cowsandmultiply;1100 lbs.andmultiply;35andCx.11;=$19,250.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Physical loss=$10,750 ($30,000_$19,250)</ITAG>(ii) Livestock products on hand or stored. (iii) Harvested crops on hand or stored. (iv) Supplies on hand. (v) Essential machinery and equipment. (7) The actual physical loss for farm dwellings and essential householdcontents to be used by the operator and existing labor is the amount requiredto repair or replace the dwelling and/or household contents with a dwellingand/or contents of like standards, size and quality of that being replacedwhich will meet all applicable code requirements, and which will providepermanent, adequate, decent, safe, sanitary and modest living quarters.(8) The actual physical loss for farm service buildings and farm real estateother than buildings is the amount required to repair the property or replaceit with a building or property of like standards, size, quality and capacityof that being replaced which will meet all applicable code requirementsand which will adequately meet the needs of the farming operation. (9) The actual physical loss for income-producing trees (fruit or nuts)is the cost of removing the damaged or destroyed trees, cleaning debrisand preparing the land for replanting, plus the cost of suitable replacementtrees and other expenses necessary to reestablish income-producing trees.Losses will not be determined by establishing a value for the trees destroyedor damaged. Any salvage value will be deducted from the loss. The applicantmay choose to replace the damaged or destroyed trees with a different enterpriseand may use actual loss loan funds for that purpose. (See Exhibit D ofthis subpart for physical loss loans to citrus growers.) (10) The actual physical loss to trees (grown for timber) will be determinedby establishing the value of trees, at the time of the disaster, less anysalvage value. This estimate of value must be determined by a recognizedforester who will cruise the timber and establish the value of the destroyedand damaged trees. The applicant may choose to replace the damaged treeenterprise with a different enterprise and use the actual loss loan fundsfor that purpose. Those applicants whose major farming enterprises areother than tree farming, but who have a wood lot that has been damaged,will have their tree losses considered as physical losses in the same manneras set forth for tree farms.(11) The actual physical loss to growing crops or pasture is the cost ofcleaning debris, preparing the land for replanting, seed, fertilizer, andother expenses necessary to <T3>reestablish</T3> the crop(s) or pasture. These costs can exceed themarket value of the crop(s) or pasture at the time of the disaster.  (12) When a crop cannot be planted during the disaster year due to thedisaster and the applicant chooses to treat the loss as a physical loss,the actual physical loss is limited to the cost of land preparation, otherexpenses incurred to the date of the disaster for crops that could notbe planted, and a pro rata share of the total operation's fixed costs suchas rent, taxes, and insurance. The applicant must provide an itemized listof all the claimed expenses incurred in the disaster year for those enterprisesfor which disaster losses are claimed. This list must be signed by theapplicant. The amount of an EM loan cannot exceed the total itemized expenseslisted by the applicant.  (13) EM loans will not be made to flood and mudslide victims to repairor replace damaged or destroyed farm dwellings or farm service buildingsand their contents in areas where ``National Flood Insurance'' is available,except as authorized in andSection;1945.173(b) of this subpart.  (14) When an applicant has <T3>dwelling</T3> losses only, the applicant may apply for either an EMloan or SBA disaster housing loan to restore or replace the dwelling andpersonal household contents affected by the disaster.    (c) <T3>Personal household content losses (Subtitle B purposes)</T3>. (1) Inorder to qualify for EM loan assistance for this purpose, the damaged ordestroyed household property must be essential to the maintenance of thehousehold; and if not repaired or replaced, the farmer would be unableto remain on the property and continue the farming operation on a reasonablysound basis.(2) The claimed value of all household losses due to disaster damage ordestruction must be supported by written estimates for the necessary repairor replacement.  (3) Labor, equipment, and materials contributed by the applicant or borrowerwill not be chargeable to the cost of necessary household repairs and replacements. (4) Damage to or destruction of non-essential household items will notbe replaced or repaired with EM loan funds. Any insurance compensationreceived or to be received for such losses will be considered as compensationfor those losses.  (5) The maximum EM loan(s) for repair or replacement of personal householdcontents is $20,000.  (6) The EM loan(s) will be determined by subtracting all insurance claimsand other compensation received or to be received for household lossesfrom the cost of repairs or replacement value of the essential householditems.  (d) <T3>Compensation for losses</T3>. All financial assistance provided throughany disaster relief program and all compensation for disaster losses receivedfrom any source by an EM loan applicant will reduce the applicant's lossby the amount of such compensation. All such compensation will be consideredin determining the applicant's eligibility for EM loan assistance and themaximum amount of loss loan entitlement. The amount of any disaster programbenefits received from ASCS, including the Emergency Feed Assistance Program(EFAP), Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), and Disaster Program payments<T3>will</T3> be considered as compensation for losses (ASCS DeficiencyPayments are not to be considered as compensation). (e) <T3>Maximum EM loans</T3>. This amount will be limited to the amount necessaryto restore the farm to its pre-disaster condition; however, this will notexceed the sum of the maximum production loss (paragraph (a)(2)(x) of thissection) and the maximum physical loss (paragraph (b) of this section)or <T3>$500,000,</T3> Whichever is the lesser. Indebted EM loan borrowerscan receive additional EM loans based on a subsequent disaster(s), butnot to exceed <T3>$500,000</T3> for each additional qualifying disaster. No applicantor individual member of an entity applicant can be liable for more than$500,000 in EM loans per disaster.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1945.164_1945.165</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1945.166</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan purposes.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Policy on use of EM loan funds</T3>. (1) The maximum amount of an EMloan(s), in addition to the limitations contained in andSection;1945.163(a)(2)(x)and (e) of this subpart, is further limited to the actual dollar loss,or the actual amount of essential family, farm, and nonfarm enterprisecredit, whichever is the lesser, that the applicant needs to carry on normaloperations. EM loan funds will not be used to finance a nonfarm enterprise,unless the loan is made to an individual applicant <T3>and</T3> such enterprise is needed to support a reasonable standardof living for the family. The use of EM loan funds will be identified inthe farm and home plan so that determination can readily be made as towhether such loan(s) was used for authorized purposes and compensated theborrower for all or a portion of the actual dollar loss.(2) EM loan funds may be used for those purposes described in paragraphs(b) and (c) of this section. (b)<T3> Real estate (Subtitle A) purposes</T3>. EM loans for real estate purposesmay be made to<T3> owner-operators only</T3>. The following are authorized real estatepurposes for which EM loan funds may be used: (1) Any Farm Ownership loan purpose (see Subpart A of Part 1943 of thischapter); (2) Replace land and/or water resources that cannot be restored due tothe disaster; (3) Establish a new site for farm dwellings and service buildings so thatthe applicant can relocate outside of a flood or mudslide prone area; (4) Replace land necessary to restore an effective operation which wasliquidated as a result of the disaster before an EM loan could be made.(5) Refinance secured and unsecured debts, including FmHA debts. (c)<T3> Operating (Subtitle B) purposes</T3>. EM loans for operating purposesmay be made to<T3> owner-operators or tenant-operators</T3>. The following are authorizedoperating purposes for which EM loan funds may be used: (1) Any Operating Loan purpose (see Subpart A of Part 1941 of this chapter);(2) Purchase and repair of essential household contents, and pay essentialfamily living expenses. Entity operations are not eligible for loan fundsto be used for these purposes. (3) Refinance secured and unsecured operating type debts, in whole or inpart, including existing FmHA debts. (4) Pay reasonable expenses customarily paid when obtaining, planning andclosing a loan made for operating purposes,<T3> e.g.,</T3> fees for legal, architectural and other technical services,which are required to be paid by the applicant, and which cannot be paidby the applicant from other resources. It is not intended that this paragraphbe interpreted to include fees charged applicants by agricultural managementconsultants and other professionals for preparation of EM loan dockets,including farm and home plans and other FmHA forms used in processing suchloans. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.167</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan limitations and special provisions. </ITAG>(a)<T3> EM loans prohibited for losses to crops grown in areas where FCICcrop insurance or multi-peril crop insurance is available.</T3> Applicantswill<T3> not</T3> be eligible for EM loans to cover damages and losses to anycrop(s) harvested after December 31, 1986, which was not insured, but couldhave been insured with FCIC crop insurance or multi-peril crop insurance.In such instances, applicants will not qualify for EM loans based on lossesto those crops which could have been insured against the losses, unlessthe crop(s) could not be planted due to the declared/designated/authorizeddisaster(s). (b)<T3> Relationship between EM loans and other FmHA loans</T3>. An eligibleEM loan applicant's<T3> total</T3> credit needs<T3> will</T3> be first considered through use of EM loan authorities inthe maximum amount of entitlement, before other regular (FO, OL, SW) FmHAfarmer program loan authorities are considered and used as a means of assistingthe applicant/borrower. (c)<T3> Use of EM loan funds is not authorized for expansion purpose(s) beyonda family size farm</T3>. EM loan funds<T3> will not</T3> be used to expand an applicant's farming, ranching,or aquaculture operation beyond that which constitutes a family size farming/ranchingoperation(s). This limitation is not intended to prohibit minor changesin crop or livestock enterprises, provided: (1) Any new or changed crop or livestock system is proven for the area;and (2) The applicant has the knowledge and ability to manage the changed operation;and (3) Substantial new or additional capital investment is not required. EM applicants who operate family farms (as defined in andSection; 1941.4of Subpart A of Part 1941 of this chapter) may, if eligible, receive regularFmHA farm ownership (FO), and/or operating (OL) loans simultaneously withtheir initial (EM) loan to help finance their farming operations. If aborrower expands the farming operation beyond a family size farm afterreceiving an EM loan, no further EM loan assistance will be given eventhough the borrower may suffer qualifying losses under a new declared/designated/authorizeddisaster. (d)<T3> Applicants involved in more than one operation</T3>. Loans to applicantsinvolved in more than one farming operation will be considered so longas the loan limit set out in andSection; 1945.163 (e) of this subpart isnot exceeded.(e) <T3>Refinancing guaranteed loans. </T3>An EM loan will not be made to refinancea guaranteed loan, except when the following conditions are met:(1) The circumstances causing the need to refinance were beyond the borrower'scontrol.(2) Refinancing is in the best interest of the Government.(f) <T3>New appraisals. </T3>New ``Appraisal of Real Estate Reports'' are notrequired if the appraisal report in the file is not over one year old,unless the approval official requests a new appraisal report, or unlesssignificant changes in the market value of real estate have occurred inan area within the one-year period.

(See Subpart B of Part 1924of this chapter.)(h) <T3>Disbursement of loan funds. </T3>Loan funds which will not be disbursedfor specific purposes at loan closing will <T3>not </T3>be requested in the initial request for funds from the FinanceOffice. The ``Loan Disbursement System'' will be used to make funds availablewhen they are actually needed. See andSection; 1945.189 (a)(8) of this subpartfor instructions on the use of supervised bank accounts.(i) <T3>Prohibition on guaranteeing repayment of advances from other creditsources. </T3>FmHA employees will not guarantee repayment of advances fromother credit sources, either personally or on behalf of applicants, borrowers,or FmHA.(j) <T3>Applicants previously indebted to FmHA. </T3>An EM loan will not beapproved if the applicant's previous FmHA debts have been settled pursuantto Part 1864 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 456.1), Subpart B of Part1956 of this chapter or if a debt settlement is currently being processedfor the applicant in accordance with these regulations or if the applicant'sproperty has been foreclosed on or repossessed by FmHA, unless the applicant'sfailure to pay the loan indebtedness was the result of circumstances beyondthe applicant's control; the conditions which necessitated the debt settlementor release, other then weather hazards, disasters, or price fluctuationshave been removed; and the borrower's operations will afford the borrowera reasonable prospect of repaying the loan and meeting other obligations.Prior to approval of the loan, the loan docket and any available case folders,including the County Supervisor's justification for making the loan, willbe submitted to the State Office for a determination as to whether theloan should be made. Applicants who are rejected due to debt settlementactions will be sent proper notification as outlined in andSection; 1910.6(b)(1)of Subpart A of Part 1910 of this chapter.(k) <T3>Highly erodible land and conversion of wetland. </T3>Loans may notbe made for any purpose that will contribute to excessive erosion of highlyerodible land or to the conversion of wetlands for the production of anagricultural commodity, as further explained in Exhibit M to Subpart Gof Part 1940 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.168</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Rates and terms.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Interest rates. </T3>Upon request of the applicant, the interest ratecharged by FmHA will be the lower of the interest rate in effect at thetime of loan approval or loan closing. If the applicant does not indicatea choice, the loan will be closed at the interest rate in effect at thetime of loan approval. Interest rates are specified in Exhibit B of FmHAInstruction 440.1 (available in any FmHA office) for the type assistanceinvolved. Interest on the initial advance will accrue from the date ofthe promissory note. Interest on other advances will accrue from the dateof the loan check for each such advance.(b) <T3>Terms of loans. </T3>Loans will be scheduled for repayment at suchtime as the FmHA approval official may determine, consistent with the purposeof and need for the loan. The approval official will also consider theuseful life of the security and the repayment ability of the applicant,as reflected in the completed farm and home plan, when setting the termof each loan. There must be some payment, e.g., an irregular payment, scheduledat least annually. Loans will not be scheduled for terms longer than arejustified and supported by the farm and home plan. EM loans based on productionlosses and/or physical losses to chattels, foundation livestock and otherintermediate term capital assets cannot exceed a 20 year payback; and EMloans based on physical losses to real estate, e.g., land, buildings andstructures cannot exceed a 40 year payback.(1) <T3>Operating purposes (Subtitle B). </T3>EM loans made for operating purposeswill be scheduled for repayment as follows:(i) Normally, loans will be scheduled for payment in a period not to exceed7 years. However, loans may be scheduled for a longer repayment periodif the FmHA approval official determines that the needs of the applicantjustify a longer term, and the loan(s) can be secured for the longer term.Such longer period may be approved as warranted, but cannot exceed 20 years.This longer repayment period will be used only when the farm and home planprojections indicate the applicant would be unable to repay the loan ina shorter period, taking into consideration rescheduling possibilities.The reason(s) that a term longer than 7 years is given must be documentedin the County Office case file.(ii) Loans made for production expenses under andSection; 1945.166(c) ofthis subpart, or for payment of bills incurred for such purposes for theoperating or crop year being financed, will be scheduled for repaymentwhen the principal income from the year's operations is normally received,<T3>unless </T3>the loan will be adequately secured with a lien(s) on itemsof collateral other than crops that are to be produced with the loan funds.In the latter event, repayment terms must comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section. (iii) Loans made to purchase or produce feed for productive livestock orlivestock to be fed for the market, or to pay bills incurred for such purposesfor the crop year being financed, will be scheduled for repayment whenthe principal income from the sale of such livestock or livestock productsis planned to be received, <T3>unless </T3>the loan will be adequately secured with a lien(s) on itemsof collateral other than the livestock and livestock products that areto be produced with the loan funds. In the latter event, repayment termsmust comply with paragraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. (iv) When conditions warrant, installments may vary in amount. However,there must be at least a partial interest payment scheduled annually. Also,the final installment will not be larger than the amount which can be expectedto be refinanced by other agricultural lenders or be repaid within a rescheduledperiod of 15 years. The applicant must be advised before the loan is closedthat FmHA will review each case at the end of the initial loan term todetermine if rescheduling is warranted, and that there is no obligationfor FmHA to continue with the borrower after the expiration of the initialloan term. (2) <T3>Real estate purposes (Subtitle A). </T3>EM loans made for real estatepurposes under andSection; 1945.165(b) of this subpart will normally be scheduledfor repayment in not to exceed 30 years. Loans may be scheduled for a longerrepayment period if the FmHA approval official determines that the needsof the applicant justify a longer repayment period. A longer term may beapproved as warranted, but cannot exceed 40 years. The longer repaymentperiod will be used only when it is evident the applicant will be unableto repay the loan in a shorter period. The reason(s) for giving the longerperiod must be well documented in the County Office case file. (c) <T3>Consolidation, rescheduling and reamortization. </T3>When the loanapproval official determines that consolidation, rescheduling, or reamortizationwill assist in the orderly collection of an EM loan, the loan approvalofficial may take such action in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1951of this chapter. (d) <T3>Graduation. </T3>Borrowers will be required to graduate when FmHA determinesthey are able to obtain their needed credit from conventional sources.All borrowers will be advised that they will be reviewed for graduationperiodically in accordance with the graduation procedure in Subpart F ofPart 1951 of this chapter. EM borrowers will be reviewed for graduationthree (3) years after their initial loan is made and every two (2) yearsthereafter, until graduation is achieved or the EM indebtedness is paidin full. Applicants will be advised during loan processing and again atloan closing that they will be required to refinance at any time when othersatisfactory credit is available to them, even though their loans havenot fully matured. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.169 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Security requirements. </ITAG>The County Supervisor is responsible for seeing that adequate and propersecurity is obtained and maintained and that the security instruments havebeen properly executed and recorded to protect the interest of the Government.(a) <T3>General requirements. </T3>(1) Except for the modifications containedin paragraph (d) of this section, security must be of such a nature andextent that repayment of the loan(s) is assured, considering the applicant'smanagerial ability, soundness of the operation, and projected earnings.Security for loans may include, but is not limited to the following: Land,buildings, structures, fixtures, furniture, machinery, equipment, livestock,livestock products, growing crops, stored crops, inventory, supplies, accountsreceivable, cash or special cash collateral accounts, marketable securities,certificates of ownership of precious metals, and cash surrender valueof life insurance. Security may also include assignments of leases or leaseholdinterests having a mortgageable value; revenues; royalties from mineralrights, patents and copyrights; and pledges of security by third parties.(2) A lien will not be taken on property that cannot be made subject toa valid lien; nor will a lien be taken on subsistence livestock, householdgoods, small tools and small equipment such as handtools, power lawn mowers,and other items of like type not needed for security purposes. A lien onfeed crops does not have to be taken if the crops produced by the borrowerare used to feed livestock, other than livestock being fed for market,and the loan is otherwise well secured. (3) When an EM loan is made to an indebted FmHA guaranteed loan borrower,a junior lien may be taken on the borrower's chattels and real estate whichserve as security for the guaranteed FmHA loan(s).(b) <T3>Personal liability. </T3>The promissory will be signed as follows:(1) <T3>Individuals. </T3>Only the applicant will sign the note as a borrower.If a cosigner is needed (see andSection; 1910.3(e) of Subpart A of Part 1910of this chapter), the cosigner will also sign the note. Any other signaturesneeded to assure the required security will be obtained as provided inState supplements. Persons who are minors or mental incompetents will notexecute a promissory note. Except when a person has pledged only propertyas security for a loan, the purpose and effect of signing a promissorynote or other evidence of indebtedness for a loan made or insured by FmHAis to incur individual personal liability regardless of any State law tothe contrary. (2) <T3>Cooperatives or corporations. </T3>The appropriate officers will executethe note on behalf of the cooperative or corporation. The individuals designatedby the cooperative or corporation that will operate the farm will signthe note as cosigner(s) and will be personally liable for the debt. (3) <T3>Partnerships or joint operations. </T3>The note will be executed bythe partner or joint operator authorized to sign for the entity, and allpartners in the partnership or joint operators in the joint operation,as cosigners. (c) <T3>Personal and corporate guarantees by cosigners. </T3>(1) If a reviewof all credit factors indicates the need for additional security, the loanapproval official may require additional personal and/or corporate guaranteesby a cosigner(s), including guarantees from parent, subsidiary or affiliatedcompanies; relatives of the applicant; or any other willing party havingequity in mortgageable assets. The loan approval official will requirethat such guarantees be secured by collateral which has an equity value.Any security referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be usedto secure the guarantees. (2) Guarantors of applicants will: (i) In the case of personal guarantees, provide current financial statements(not over 30 days old at time of filing), signed by the guarantors anddisclosing community or homestead property. (ii) In the case of corporate guarantees, provide current financial statements(not over 30 days old at time of filing), certified by an officer of thecorporation. (3) When security is taken under paragraph (c) of this section, if chattels,it will be serviced in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1962 of this chapter;and, if real estate, in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1965 of thischapter. (d) <T3>Applicant's repayment ability. </T3>When adequate security is not availablebecause of the disaster, the loan approval official will accept as securitysuch collateral as is available, if the following conditions are met: (1) A portion or all of the security has depreciated in value <T3>due to the disaster; </T3>and (2) The available security, together with the approval official's confidencein the applicant's repayment ability, is adequate to secure the loan. Whenconsidering ``repayment ability'' as a form of security, the reserve ormargin between the balance available for debt repayment shown on the farmand home plan, and the principal and interest scheduled for payment isthe ``repayment ability'' collateral which may be considered in loan makingactions when this plan is developed for the typical year. The ``typicalyear'' plan must show that the portion of the loan secured by ``repaymentability'' will be paid back in a reasonable period of time, <T3>i.e., </T3>the loan balance will be reduced to a fully secured loanwithin 3 years. (e) <T3>Life insurance. </T3>If the loan approval official believes it is neededas additional security, life insurance <T3>may </T3>be required for the individual borrower or for the members,stockholders, partners, joint operators, of an entity borrower, listingFmHA as the beneficiary. This life insurance may be decreasing term insurance.A schedule of life insurance available as security for the loan will beincluded as part of the application. (f) <T3>Security for operating type purposes. </T3>(1) EM loans made for SubtitleB (operating) purposes will be secured by a first lien on the crop(s) and/orlivestock and livestock products being financed with EM loan funds. However,if the applicant does not have sufficient equity to secure the entire amountof the loan, additional security as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection will be taken to assure that the Government's financial interestwill be protected. When the applicant can provide <T3>no </T3>security other than a first lien on the crop(s) and/or livestockand livestock products to be produced, the amount of the loan will be limitedto 75 percent of the planned gross farm income as shown on the Farm andHome Plan based on normal production and prices authorized by the StateDirector for developing annual farm plans within the State. (2) The advice of OGC will be obtained on how to perfect a security interestwhen milk base and grazing permits are taken as security. (3) General intangibles, accounts receivable, and contract rights may betaken as security for production loss loans made to contract feeders, tenantswith share-lease arrangements, or other farmers with similar arrangements.(g) <T3>Security for real estate type purposes. </T3>EM loans made for SubtitleA (real estate purposes) will be secured by a lien on real estate. However,if the applicant does not have sufficient equity in the real estate tosecure the entire amount of the loan, additional security as prescribedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be taken. (h) <T3>Combination of real estate and chattel security. </T3>When chattelsare primarily relied upon as security and real estate is taken only asadditional security to better protect the Government's interest, only acertification of ownership and verification of equity in real estate isrequired, if the applicant is an individual. Certification of ownershipmay be accepted in the form of a notarized affidavit from the applicantstating who is the owner of record of the real estate in question and acknowledgingall known debts, with balances owed, against the real estate. Wheneverthe County Supervisor is uncertain of the ownership of or debts againstthe real estate security, and for all loans to cooperatives, corporations,partnerships, or joint operations a title search is required. (i) <T3>Security for personal household contents. </T3>EM loan funds advancedfor the purposes authorized in andSection; 1945.163(c)(2) of this subpartwill be secured by equity in farm machinery, livestock and/or real estate.Liens will not be taken on basic essential personal property (See andSection;1945.154(a)(16) of this subpart). (j) <T3>Purchase contracts. </T3>If the real estate offered as security isheld under a purchase contract, the following conditions must exist: (1) The applicant must be able to provide a mortgageable interest in thereal estate. (2) The applicant and the seller must agree in writing that any insuranceproceeds received for real estate losses will be used only to replace orrepair the damaged real estate improvements which are essential to thefarming operation; or used for other essential real estate improvements;or paid on the EM loan or on any prior real estate indebtedness, includingthe purchase contract. If necessary, the applicant will negotiate withthe seller to arrive at a new contract without any provisions objectionableto FmHA. (3) If a satisfactory contract for sale cannot be negotiated or the sellerrefuses to enter into the agreement described in paragraph (j)(2) of thissection, the applicant will make every effort to refinance the existingpurchase contract. If the applicant cannot obtain refinancing from anothersource, EM loan funds may be considered to pay off the contract. (4) If the conditions set out in paragraphs (j) (1), (2) and (3) of thissection exist and an EM loan is approved, it can be closed provided theFmHA escrow agent or designated attorney certifies on Form FmHA 427-10,``Final Title Opinion'', or in separate writing that: (i) The purchase contract is not subject to summary cancellation on defaultand does not contain any other provisions which might jeopardize eitherthe Government's security position or the borrower's ability to repay theloan. (ii) The seller has agreed, in writing, to give FmHA notice of any breachby the purchaser, and has also agreed to give FmHA the option to rectifythe condition(s) which amounts to a breach within thirty days. The thirtydays begin to run on the day FmHA receives written notice of the breach.(k) <T3>Prior liens which may jeopardize the Government's security position.</T3>If any prior liens against real estate offered as security containfuture advance provisions or other provisions which might jeopardize thesecurity position of the Government or the applicant's ability to meetthe obligations of these prior liens and to pay the EM loan, the priorlienholders involved must agree in writing, before the loan is closed,to modify, waive, or subordinate such objectionable provisions to the interestof the Government. However, the Government's lien may be subject to thelien of another creditor for amounts advanced or to be advanced for annualoperating and family living expenses for the operating or calendar year.The County Supervisor will determine if the creditor will be required toexecute Form FmHA 441-13, ``Division of Income and Nondisturbance Agreement,''or a similar form approved by the OGC. (l) <T3>Circumstances under which advance notice of foreclosure or assignmentis required. </T3>When a junior lien on real estate is to be taken as securityfor a loan in States where a prior lienholder may foreclose the securityinstrument under power of sale, or otherwise, and extinguish junior liensof private parties without giving junior lienholders actual notice of theforeclosure proceedings, the prior lienholder must agree in writing togive FmHA advance notice of foreclosure or will offer to assign the mortgageto FmHA for the amount of the outstanding debt owed to the prior lienholder.(m) <T3>Hazard insurance. </T3>Hazard insurance with a standard mortgage clausenaming FmHA as beneficiary may be required for every loan made. The minimumamount of insurance required is the lesser of the replacement cost of theproperty being insured or the amount of the loan. If essential insurablebuildings are located on the property, or if new buildings are to be erectedor major improvements are to be made to existing buildings, the applicantwill provide adequate hazard insurance coverage at the time of loan closing,or as of the date materials are delivered to the property, whichever isappropriate. Notwithstanding the requirements of Subpart A of Part 1806(FmHA Instruction 426.1) of this chapter, when the real estate appraisalreport shows that the present market value of the land after deductingthe value of buildings shown on the report exceeds the amount of the debt(including the EM loan) and the owner has equity equal to or exceedingthe amount of the debt (including the EM loan), real estate property insurancemay not be required. However, the applicant will be encouraged to obtainsuch insurance, if the applicant does not already have it, to protect theapplicant's interest. If insurance claims for loss or damage to buildingsto be replaced or repaired with loan funds are outstanding at the timethe loan is approved, the applicant will be required to agree in writingthat, when settlement is made, the proceeds of such claims will be usedfor replacement or repair of buildings, application on debts secured byprior liens, or application on the EM loan. (n) <T3>Crop insurance. </T3>Crop insurance is a good management tool. Loanapproval officials will, therefore, during the loan making process, encourage<T3>all </T3>borrowers who grow crops to obtain and maintain FCIC cropinsurance or multi-peril crop insurance, if it is available.(1) When EM loan funds are to be used as the primary source of financingfor the ensuring year's crop production expenses, and such crop(s) willserve as security for the loan, and crop insurance is purchased by theborrower, FmHA will require an ``Assignment of Indemnity'' on the borrower'scrop insurance policy(ies).(2) When FmHA is not the primary lender for annual crop production expenses,but has or will have a security interest in the crop(s), and the applicanthas purchased or will purchase crop insurance, an ``Assignment of Indemnity''will be taken by FmHA, if the primary lender chooses not to do so.(3) When EM loans are based on physical losses only, and loan funds willbe used for annual production expenses the same conditions will prevailas stated in paragraph (n)(1) of this section.(4) When the payment of crop insurance premiums is not required until afterharvest, the premiums may be paid by releasing insured crop(s) sale proceeds,notwithstanding the limits in andSection;andSection; 1962.17 and 1962.29(b)of Subpart A of Part 1962 of this chapter. If the borrower's crop lossesare sufficient to warrant an indemnity payment, the premium due will bededucted by the insurance carrier from such payment. The FmHA County Officewill maintain a record on Form FmHA 1905-12, ``Monthly Expirations,'' ofthe dates which each borrowers' crop insurance premium(s) is due. Thisis in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1905-A, a copy of which is availablein any FmHA County Office.(o) <T3>Indian trust lands.</T3> EM loans which are secured by trust or restrictedland will be handled as follows: USDA and the Department of the Interiorhave agreed that FmHA loans which are to be secured by real estate liensmay be made to Indians holding land in severalty under trust patents ordeeds containing restrictions against alienation, subject to statues underwhich they may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, givevalid and enforceable mortgages on their land. These statutes include,but are not limited to, the Act of March 29, 1956, (70 Stat. 62). Whena lien is to be taken on trust or restricted property in connection witha loan to be made or insured by FmHA, the local representatives of theBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will furnish requested advice and informationwith respect to the property and each applicant. The FmHA State Directorshould arrange with the Area Director or other appropriate local officialof the BIA as to the manner in which the information will be requestedand furnished. A State supplement will be issued to prescribe the actionsto be taken by FmHA personnel to implement the making of loans under theseconditions.(p) <T3>Unpatented public lands.</T3> See Exhibit A of Subpart A of Part 1943of this chapter for making EM loans to entrymen on unpatented public lands.(q) <T3>Taking security instruments.</T3> The taking and filing of securityinstruments will be in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1941 of this chapter(chattels and crops) and with andSection;andSection; 1945.169 and 1945.189of this subpart (real estate). The borrower must have marketable titleto the property which secures the loan and FmHA must ascertain that, whenthe security instruments are filed, no suits are pending or threatenedwhich would adversely affect the interest of the borrower and the Government.(r) <T3>Assignments and consents.</T3> (1) The value of stock required to bepurchased by the Federal Land Bank (FLB) Association borrowers may be addedto the recommended market value of real estate, provided:(i) An assignment can be obtained on the stock; and(ii) An agreement is obtained which provides that:(A) The value of the stock at the time the FLB loan is satisfied will beapplied on the FLB loan as long as any FmHA loan is outstanding, or (B) The stock refund check is made payable to the borrower and FmHA.(iii) The total of the stock value and the recommended market value ofreal estate is indicated in the comments section of Form FmHA 422-1, ``AppraisalReport (Farm Tract).''(2) An assignment of all or part of the applicant's share of income isrequired when title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractorunder a written contract or when the enterprise is to be managed by theapplicant under a share lease or share agreement. The contract, share leaseor share agreement will be described specifically as ``Contract Rights''or ``Contract Rights in Livestock or Crops,'' (or as ``Accounts'' or ``Accountsin Livestock or Crops,'' if required by a State supplement) and so forth,in paragraph (b)(1) of the financing statement. A form approved by OGCwill be used to obtain the assignment.(3) An assignment of income will ordinarily be taken to protect FmHA'sinterests.(i) Form FmHA 443-16, ``Assignment of Income from Real Estate Security,''will be used for assignments of real estate security income unless thatform is legally inadequate in a particular State, in which case it maybe adopted with the approval of the OGC.(ii) Form FmHA 441-8, ``Assignment of Proceeds from the Sale of Products,''will be used for products or income in which FmHA does not have a securityinterest under the UCC. Other forms approved by OGC may be used when thisform is not adequate.(iii) Form FmHA 441-25, ``Assignment of Proceeds from the Sale of DairyProducts and Release of Security Interest,'' will be used for dairy productsin which FmHA has a security interest under the UCC.(iv) Form FmHA 441-18, ``Consent to Payment of Proceeds from Sale of FarmProducts,'' will be used for products or income, except dairy products,in which FmHA has a security interest under the UCC.(v) Forms provided by ASCS will be used for assignments of disaster andregular agricultural program payments.(4) In UCC states, an assignment of income constitutes a security agreementand should be treated accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 1945.170-1945.172</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1945.173</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions_compliance requirements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Scope of operation to be financed.</T3> Only family size farming operationsmay be financed with EM loans, subject to the eligibility requirements,loan amount ceilings, repayment ability, need, available security, andother provisions of this subpart.(b) <T3>Flood or mudslide prone areas. </T3>Flood or mudslide hazards willbe evaluated whenever the farm to be financed is located in special floodor mudslide prone areas as designated by the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA). Subpart B of Part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction426.2) and Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter will be complied withwhen loan funds are used to construct or improve buildings located in suchareas. This will not prevent making loans on farms where the farmsteadis located in a flood or mudslide prone area and funds are not includedfor building improvements. The flood or mudslide hazard will be recognizedin the appraisal report.(1) In identified special flood or mudslide prone areas as designated byFEMA, the following policies are applicable for EM loans being made tofinance buildings or fixtures and furnishings contained therein.(i) If flood or mudslide insurance is available and an applicant has nottaken such insurance and has suffered flood or mudslide losses, an EM loanmay be made only if flood or mudslide insurance is purchased before theEM loan is closed.(ii) If flood or mudslide insurance is available and an applicant previouslyreceived and still is indebted for an EM loan, Rural Housing Disaster (RHD),or SBA disaster loan; and a condition of the loan required the obtainingof flood insurance but the applicant allowed the insurance to lapse; andthe applicant had new flood or mudslide losses, the applicant will be consideredto be in default on the loan agreement and dealt with accordingly.(iii) If flood and mudslide insurance is available and an applicant hadpreviously received an EM, RHD, or SBA disaster loan; and a condition ofthe loan required obtaining flood or mudslide insurance and the applicantpaid the loan in full and let the insurance lapse; the applicant will behandled in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.(iv) In those areas that have been designated by FEMA as special floodor mudslide hazard areas and flood or mudslide insurance is not availableor has been withdrawn by FEMA, an applicant can receive an EM loan providedthe farm buildings, including the dwelling, are relocated outside the 100-yearflood area.(v) EM loans to repair or replace farm buildings, including dwellings,must meet the requirements of andSection; 1806.25 (a) or (b) of Subpart Bof Part 1806 of this chapter (paragraph V A or B of FmHA Instruction 426.2)as applicable, or be relocated outside the 100-year flood area.(2) When land development or improvements such as dikes, terraces, fences,and intake structures are planned to be located in special flood or mudslideprone areas, EM loan funds may be used subject to the following:(i) The Corps of Engineers or the SCS will be consulted concerning:(A) Likelihood of flooding.(B) Probability of flooding damage.(C) Recommendations on special design and specifications needed to minimizeflood and mudslide hazards.(ii) FmHA representatives will evaluate the proposal and record the decisionin the loan docket in accordance with the requirements of Subpart G ofPart 1940 of this chapter.(c) <T3>Civil rights. </T3>The provisions of Subpart E of Part 1901 of thischapter will be complied with on all loans made which involve:(1) Funds used to finance nonfarm enterprises and recreation enterprises.Applicants will sign Form FmHA 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement,'' in thesecases.(2) Any development financed by FmHA that will be performed by a contractor subcontract of more than $10,000.(d) <T3>Protection of historical and archaeological properties. </T3>If thereis any evidence to indicate the property to be financed has historicalor archaeological value, the provisions of Subpart F of Part 1901 and SubpartG of Part 1940 of this chapter will apply.(e) <T3>Environmental requirements. </T3>See Subpart G of Part 1940 of thischapter for applicable requirements.(f) <T3>Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. </T3>The provisions of the RealEstate Settlement Procedures Act outlined in andSection; 1940.406 of SubpartI of Part 1940 of this chapter apply when EM funds are used involving tractsof less than 25 acres if:(1) Any part of the loan is used to purchase all or part of the land tobe mortgaged, and(2) The loan is secured by a first lien on the property where a dwellingis located.(g) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirements. </T3>In accordance with Federal Law,the FmHA will not discriminate against any otherwise qualified applicanton the basis of race, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, age,or physical/mental handicap (provided the applicant can execute a legalcontract), with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.

This planning process with the applicant is essential tomaking sound loans and, therefore, must receive careful attention in developmentof the loan docket. However, when the EM loan will be for not more than$25,000, Tables A, D, and E of Form FmHA 431-2 may be left blank, and onlythe totals in Tables G and J should be shown, provided Form FmHA 410-1is completed and accurately reflects the applicant's current circumstances,and no supervision is planned. The plan <T3>will </T3>show any major items of expenditure and the reason(s) theseitems are needed. When preparing a plan of operation, it is usually necessaryto plan for a capital expenditure reserve during interim years and thetypical year. Realistically, this will reflect the depreciating value ofmachinery, equipment or other essential capital expenditure items, whichit is prudent to expect will need to be replaced or require major repair.Also, all recurring and carry-over debts should be considered in a typicalyear plan. In addition, when all of the loan funds are not to be disbursedat loan closing, a <T3>Monthly Budget </T3>will be prepared showing the specific amount tobe disbursed for each associated loan purpose for each month. The fundswill be disbursed through use of the loan disbursement system (future advances)or, when determined necessary, through a supervised bank account.(2) Development work will be planned and completed in accordance with SubpartA of Part 1924 of this chapter.

The rightsto mining products, gravel, oil, gas, coal or other minerals will be considereda portion of the security and will be specifically included as a part ofthe appraised value of the real estate securing the loans using Form FmHA1922-11, ``Appraisal Form for Mineral Rights.'' Appraisals are not requiredwhen:(i) The amount of EM loan(s) plus any existing FmHA principal indebtednessis $25,000 or less, and(ii) The loan approval official determines the loan is adequately securedwithout an appraisal, and(iii) The County Supervisor indicates in the loan docket an estimate ofthe market value of the real estate to be taken as security, and(iv) The provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section are applicable.(2) Real estate appraisals will be completed as provided in FmHA Instruction422.1 (available in any FmHA office). However, the value of assets thatsecure EM loans associated with a disaster having any portion of its incidenceperiod occurring on or after May 31, 1983, must be based on the higherof two appraisals; all of which must be made a part of the file. Theseappraisals will show:(i) The asset value on the day before a State Governor's, Indian TribalCouncil's, or an FmHA State Director's first EM designation request, whichis associated with the naming of one or more counties in a State as a disasterarea where eligible farmers may qualify for EM loans; or(ii) The asset value one year (365 days) before the date set in paragraph(c)(2)(i) of this section.(A) The following types of real estate offered as collateral for securingEM loans will be appraised at the present market value only;(<T3>1</T3>) Farm real estate the applicant/borrower did not own on thedates set forth in paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.(<T3>2</T3>) Real estate ``not owned'' by the applicant/borrower (for example,a relative if offering real estate as collateral for the proposed EM loan).(<T3>3</T3>) A single family dwelling located on a nonfarm tract.(<T3>4</T3>) Other types of real estate such as apartment houses and commercialbuildings. The County Supervisor will request the assistance of the StateDirector in establishing the value of such real estate.(B) Sales data utilized in the preparation of the necessary appraisalsshould conform to the dates set forth in paragrpah (c)(2) (i) and (ii)of this section, to ensure a fair market value of the property is established.In addition, it should be confirmed that said sales resulted from reasonablesales efforts and that both the buyer and seller were willing, informed,and knowledgeable parties.(3) When FLB stock is to be used in establishing the Recommended MarketValue (RMV) of the real estate being appraised, see andSection; 1945.169(r)(1) of this subpart.(4) When real estate is taken as additional security (for loans in whichthe primary security is subject to rapid depreciation or is of a high risknature, such as crops), no appraisal report will be required for the additionalsecurity, provided the County Supervisor determines the security is adequate,and records the estimated value in the running case record, shows the datethe property was inspected and certifies that in his/her opinion the estimatesare correct based on knowledge of the value of the comparable assets inthe area. (5) Chattel appraisals will be completed on Form FmHA 1945-15, ``ValueDetermination Worksheet,'' when chattels are taken as security. The propertywhich will serve as security will be described in sufficient detail soit can be identified. Sources such as livestock market reports and publicationsreflecting values of farm machinery and equipment will be used as appropriate.The value of assets that secure EM loans associated with a disaster havingany portion of the incidence period occurring on or after May 31, 1983,must be based on the higher of two appraisals, all of which must be madepart of the file. These appraisals will be based on the same informationcontained in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Chattels notowned by the applicant, and nonfarm chattel property offered as security(such as planes, house trailers, boats, etc.) will be apprasied at thepresent market value only. Chattels that the applicant/borrower did notown on the dates set forth in paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this sectionwill be appraised at the present market value only. (6) Abbreviated appraisals may be used and loans approved when: (i) The loan approval official determines that the applicant's equity inthe collateral will adequately secure the EM loan(s). (ii) The abbreviated appraisals are prepared as follows: (A) For real estate_Form FmHA 422-1, ``Appraisal Report-Farm Tract,'' completethe heading of the report; Part 1, Item A; Part 2; Part 3; Part 6; Part7 and Part 8.
