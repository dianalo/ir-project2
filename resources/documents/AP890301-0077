Jacobo Arenas, leader of the leftist Colombian RevolutionaryArmed Forces, declared in a recorded message broadcast over radionationwide that the cease-fire began at 6 p.m. Tuesday.   While no incidents had been reported early today, PresidentVirgilio Barco's administration has expressed pessimism about thechances of stopping the insurrection.   Right-wing death squads have sprung up in response to the leftistguerrillas, and the rightists have been blamed for killing at least1,000 people in the last three years.   Also on Tuesday, a peace commission in Bogota began work toward ageneral cease-fire to the insurrection, which has claimed 76,000lives in the past 76 years.   Raul Orejuela Buena, minister of government, said last week theguerrillas were manipulating the Roman Catholic church-sponsoredcommission and it had little more chance of success than the lastpresident, Belisario Betancur, experienced in pursuing a cease-fire.   Betancur's government negotiated a truce with most of theestimated 10,000 guerrillas in Colombia's five guerrilla armies, butit collapsed under the weight of accusations by rebels and securityforces.   Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, a former president from Barco's LiberalParty, on Tuesday rejected the government minister's criticism ofthe commission.   ``Trying to save human lives and put an end to the spilling ofblood, I am disposed to hear all those of good faith and even badfaith who might have something to suggest,'' he said in a statement.   Two other rebel groups, the April 19 Movement and the QuintinLame, said last month they would like to begin peace talks, but theremaining two have shown no inclination to negotiate.   One, the People's Revolutionary Army, claimed responsibility fora bomb that exploded Monday at the Bogota offices of an Americanmissionary group, the Summer Institute of Linguistics ofDuncanville, Texas.   The National Liberation Army has said it will never stop fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
