The decision revises ICC standards for determining a railroad's return on investment, a figure used to measure whether a railroad is &quot;revenue adequate.&quot; That determination is one of the factors used in deciding if specific rates are subject to regulation.    Among other changes, the commission switched the depreciation method used for railroad assets, and ruled that railroads will be required to remove deferred taxes and tax credits from the investment base used in computing the return on investment.    Also, the ICC ruled that earnings from rail-related subsidiaries will be included in the return calculations.    The commission said those changes were requested by shippers. It rejected, however, a request by shippers to change the way a railroad's cost of capital is figured, deciding instead to continue basing that calculation on current interest rates. </TEXT></DOC>
