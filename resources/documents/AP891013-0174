Common Cause, along with Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., requestedthe ethics investigation last year that eventually led to theresignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, asked the SenateEthics Committee to determine whether Sens. Alan Cranston,D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., JohnGlenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., violated ethicsrules when they met with regulators in April 1987 concerningLincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.   All five had received substantial campaign contributions fromPhoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of AmericanContinental Corp., Lincoln's parent.   At the same time, the group called on the Justice Department todetermine whether Keating and Lincoln violated federal electionlaws in their efforts to influence the senators.   ``The joint intervention ... into a case involving allegedviolations by a specific company ... appears to be an extraordinaryaction,'' Wertheimer said.   Lincoln, which is insolvent, was seized by federal regulators onApril 14 after more than two years of audits and examinations.Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion toprotect the institution's depositors.   Last month, the government filed a $1.1 billion civil lawsuitcharging Keating, his family and associates with fraud andracketeering. Among the allegations are that Keating diverted moneyfrom Lincoln to fund his personal, political and charitableconvictions.   Leonard Bickwit, an attorney representing Keating's company,defended the millionaire's right to contribute to and seek helpfrom the senators.   ``Mr. Keating and the organizations he's been in associationwith had every right to make these contributions, which were withinthe limits of the law. He also has the right to seek the support ofhis representatives on matters of importance to him and he oughtnot to be more restricted in that regard than others who have notcontributed,'' Bickwit said, reading a prepared statement.   According to Common Cause, Keating contributed $850,000 to threeprivate organizations founded or controlled by Cranston and $47,000to Cranston's campaigns; $200,000 to a political committeecontrolled by Glenn as well as a $34,000 campaign contribution;campaign contributions of $112,000 and free jet flights valued at$13,433 to McCain and his family; $76,100 to Riegle's campaign and$55,000 to DeConcini's election effort.   Riegle returned the contribution in March 1988, DeConcini lastmonth. McCain reimbursed American Continental for the jet flightsbut has not given back the $112,000.   The five senators all issued statements pledging theircooperation with any probe. McCain, in letters to the ethics paneland Justice Department, added, ``I am fully confident that Iengaged in no unethical conduct.''   Cranston said he met with regulators to urge them to bring theirlengthy examination of Lincoln to a conclusion, not to influenceits outcome. ``I did not violate any ethics rules or standards,''he said.   Riegle said he attended the meeting only at the request ofMcCain and DeConcini and said his conduct was ``entirely proper.''   Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should appoint aspecial counsel to determine whether the intervention violated theCode of Ethics for Government Service that prohibits members ofCongress from accepting ``favors or benefits under circumstanceswhich might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing theperformance of governmental duties.''   In a letter, he asked Gerald E. McDowell, chief of the JusticeDepartment's public integrity section, to determine whetherKeating's contribution to the senators violated federal electionlaws or other statutes.   In the case against Wright, the former speaker also was accusedof intervening with regulators on behalf of Sandamp;L owners. ButWertheimer said, ``I think we have a different case, differentcircumstances.''   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee, in preparation for fourpublic hearings on the case beginning next week, voted Thursday tosubpoena Keating and regulators who oversaw his institution.   The hearings are expected to focus on why M. Danny Wall, as thenation's top Sandamp;L regulator, delayed action from mid-1987 untilApril on a recommendation from field examiners that the governmenttake control of Lincoln.</TEXT></DOC>
