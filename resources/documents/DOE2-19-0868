Boercker and C. A. Iglesias [Phys. Rev. A 30, 2771 (1984)].They are then used to recalculate the plasma shifts of hydrogen and ionized-heliumlines from electron collisions, inhomogeneities in the ion-produced quasistaticfields, and some higher-order effects. Because of the partial cancellationof electron collisional shifts by the other effects, inclusion of the{Delta}n = 0 collisional shifts leads to an increase of calculated lineshifts by a factor {similar_to}1.5, which for Balmer lines of hydrogenand Paschen lines of ionized helium leads to markedly improved agreementwith most measurements. Estimates for higher-Z members (Z{ge}4) of theone-electron isoelectronic sequence yield {Delta}n = 0, dipole contributionsto the electron-collisional shifts which are much smaller than the effectsof {Lambda} = 0, penetrating monopole interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
