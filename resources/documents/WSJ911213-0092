One that oftendivides America. A subject so fraught with potentialcontroversy that when producers Judith Walcutt and DavidOssman solicited 150 of America's largest corporations andfoundations for funding, not a single one was willing to lendits name or money to the program.   What is this too-hot-to-handle PR pariah that hasfrightened off many of our most distinguished philanthropicinstitutions? Take a deep breath, folks. It's the U.S. Billof Rights.</LP><TEXT>   Sunday marks its 200th anniversary as the law of the land.But don't look for fireworks over the Hudson River or a BobHope special. About the only national media attention will bea radio dramatization by Mr. Corwin called &quot;We Hold TheseTruths,&quot; to air Saturday and Sunday on most public radiostations and on all commercial radio networks. And thefunding for even this modest project squeaked through only 10weeks before air time from the Pew Charitable Trust. (Fivedays before air time the National Endowment for the Arts,sensing a winner, contributed additional money.)   For Mr. Corwin, 81 years old, this says troubling thingsabout contemporary America. And he ought to know, because 50years ago he wrote and directed the original &quot;We Hold TheseTruths,&quot; which marked the document's 150th anniversary. Inthose days Mr. Corwin was an intense-looking, lanky formerjournalist who had come to CBS in 1938 and turned into aninnovative, often experimental writer-director. He had apopular frontish faith in &quot;the People&quot; and the power toexpress it with a mixture of mockery and reverence thatpacked a formidable punch on the air. He became the network'sboy wonder when he produced a homily to Americana called&quot;Ballad for Americans.&quot; It was pure Corwin: a mix of folksyvernacular and elegant rhetoric that endowed ordinaryexistence with mythic consequence. By 1941 he had becomeAmerica's unofficial laureate of anti-fascism.   That fall Archibald MacLeish, head of the Library ofCongress, decided to make the 150th anniversary of the Billof Rights a national celebration and turned to Mr. Corwin tocreate an inspiring commemorative broadcast. MacLeish wantedan event and he got one, though and not entirely at Mr.Corwin's hands. Pearl Harbor changed the entire character ofthe production from a benediction to freedom to an invocationto war. Broadcast on all four networks with Orson Welles,Corporal James Stewart, Walter Huston, Lionel Barrymore,Edward G. Robinson and even Franklin Roosevelt, &quot;We HoldThese Truths&quot; was a lump-in-the-throat pep talk on Americanfreedom that drew the largest radio audience in history tothat time -- 60 million people.   In the years that followed, Mr. Corwin experimented withradio forms and techniques. CBS reaped prestige from Mr.Corwin, but rarely profits. Sponsors were leery of hispassion for public issues, progressive causes and free verse.His programs usually aired in sacrificial time slots oppositeBob Hope or Jack Benny. But he didn't mind because he knewtheir audience wasn't his. When William Paley suggested in1948 that he try writing for &quot;a broader public,&quot; however, heknew the glory days were over. He left the network forfree-lance work, which included an Oscar-nominated screenplayfor &quot;Lust for Life.&quot;   Mr. Corwin now comes full circle. Still tall, with a thickhead of wavy white hair, he's observed America's periodicdiscomforts over its Bill of Rights for a quarter of its 200years, and rarely from the sidelines. In the '40s, his wordshelped define fascism to the nation. Ten years later, thealchemy of Cold War politics had turned those words ashocking &quot;pink.&quot; &quot;I was never on a `black' list,&quot; he says,claiming no martyrdom, &quot;more a gray list.&quot; Actually, he wason the original Red Channels list, along with Aaron Copland,Edward R. Murrow, Leonard Bernstein and Orson Welles.   And what had Mr. Corwin written that was so suspect? &quot;Howabout `We Hold These Truths'?&quot; he says today, as if toitalicize the irony. &quot;That's one of them. You bet. Nothingmakes a bully more nervous than the freedom of others toignore him.&quot;   Fifty years after the first &quot;We Hold These Truths,&quot; Mr.Corwin finds the Bill of Rights once again embattled. &quot;It's asource of more controversy today than at any time in itshistory. Drug traffic and RICO laws threaten the FourthAmendment's search and seizure protections; federal money forthe arts is given in exchange for First Amendment freedoms;and religious true believers want to turn their opinions onmorality into law.&quot;   He cringes at the notion of &quot;political correctness&quot;:&quot;There's something stiff and unbending about the idea ofcorrectness,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not gainsaying its valuesnecessarily. But the Bill of Rights doesn't offer freedomfrom speech. To silence an idea because it might offend aminority doesn't protect that minority. It deprives it of thetool it needs most -- the right to talk back. Exemptions arefor the tax laws, not the Bill of Rights. Sure, it's a highprice. But if you want a bargain-basement bill of rights, Iknow a lot of places you can get one. They're very quietplaces because no one makes noise. Correctness silencesnoise. I say the more noise the better.&quot;   The 1991 &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot; is brilliantly narrated byRichard Dysart of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and features James Earl Jones,Studs Terkel, Ray Bradbury and many others. It's not are-creation, though. Mr. Corwin has revised the original andreached beyond the first 10 amendments to seven othersaffecting individual rights. Two were not even in theConstitution in 1941. And to the heroes of the 1941 edition,he's now added a heroine, Carrie Chapman Catt (JillEikenberry, also of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;), champion of women'ssuffrage.   During the taping last weekend in Burbank, Calif., aprocession of television's best actors sat drinking coffeeand conducting spontaneous little seminars on Americanhistory. Sometimes it got loud. It was the kind of sweetnoise Norman Corwin has taken pleasure and pride in provokingfor five decades.   ---   Mr. McDonough is a free-lance writer based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
