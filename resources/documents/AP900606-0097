North Carolina Democrats pickeda black man to try to dethrone GOP Sen. Jesse Helms.   In the longest count of a nine-state primary election, AlabamaAttorney General Don Siegelman squeezed into a runoff for theDemocratic nomination for governor with teacher lobbyist PaulHubbert after an all-night vote tally. The winner of the June 26balloting will face GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.   Seven senators gained nominations for new terms. GOP Sen. ThadCochran of Mississippi was arguably the biggest winner among them.He faces no Democratic opposition in the fall and is thus assured ofa new term.   Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin of Alabamaand Max Baucus of Montana easily overcame challenges within theirparty, while Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republicans LarryPressler of South Dakota and Pete Domenici of New Mexico wereunopposed.   Incumbent governors in Iowa and South Dakota also wererenominated, along with Hunt in Alabama.   In California, both Feinstein and Wilson, a second-term senator,were kicking off their fall campaigns with breakfast appearances.   ``Whoop it up tonight because this is your last victory party ofthe 1990s,'' Wilson told the Democrats late Tuesday night afterbreezing to his nomination.   Democratic national chairman Ron Brown hailed Feinstein's successand called the defeat of two Republican-backed redistrictingreferenda a ``blowout for us.''   ``They are going to have a money advantage,'' he said, referringto Wilson's $3 million warchest. But, he added, ``issues are goingto prevail.''   It was the California Democratic primary for governor that drewmost of the nationwide attention, both for the size of the state andbecause the next governor will play a large role in determiningwhich party benefits from a census that may increase the state'scongressional delegation by a half-dozen seats.   ``One mission completed, one to go,'' former San Francisco MayorFeinstein told supporters after securing her victory in ahard-fought primary.   With 99 percent of the precincts counted, she had 52 percent ofthe vote, to 41 percent for Attorney General John Van de Kamp. Nineother candidates split the remaining votes.   Wilson breezed to an easy primary victory on the GOP side, andsaid he'd keep the governor's office in Republican hands. He decidedto run for the job when GOP Gov. George Deukmejian declined to seeka third term.   Feinstein praised Van de Kamp in her victory speech and said thefall campaign will be a choice between two Californias. ``One ...with a declining quality of life, more crime, more traffic ... It iscontent with caretaker government,'' she said. ``But our Californiais a ... bold place.''   In North Carolina, Helms congratulated Harvey Gantt on ``ahard-earned victory.''   ``How sweet it is,'' a jubilant Gantt told supporters afterdispatching prosecutor Mike Easley with 57 percent of the vote. Hisvictory made him the first of his race to win a Senate nominationthis century in North Carolina.   ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he is. It's a new dayin North Carolina,'' said Gantt, a former mayor of Charlotte.   Alabama boasted the closest race of the night, a Democraticprimary to pick an opponent for incumbent GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.   Education Association lobbyist Hubbert and Siegelman claimed theright to face off in the runoff. With 96 percent of precinctsreporting, Hubbert was winning 32 percent of the vote and Siegelman25 percent, followed by former Gov. Fob James with 22 percent andRep. Ronnie Flippo 17 percent. Two other candidates trailed.   ``This is no place for the faint-hearted,'' said Flippo as thelong count continued.   In an Iowa primary contest viewed as a referendum on abortion,House Speaker Don Avenson claimed the Democratic nomination forgovernor against GOP incumbent Terry Branstad, who opposes abortion.Avenson, who favors abortion rights, won 40 percent of the vote todefeat anti-abortion Democrat Tom Miller and three other contenders.The National Organization for Women and the National Abortion RightsActionLeague, both of which endorsed Avenson, had feared he wouldsplit the vote with other pro-choice contenders and permit Miller towin.   In addition to picking candidates for governor, Californiansvoted to raise the state gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon tofinance badly needed highway repair. Supporters said approval of themeasure would mark a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began in1978 with passage of Proposition 13. With 98 percent of precinctscounted, the proposal was gaining 52 percent of the vote.   The lines were drawn for what shape up as some of the nation'smost contested Senate elections in November, when Republicans seekto cut into the current 55-45 Democratic advantage.   Republicans count Harkin as among the most vulnerable Democrats,and Rep. Tom Tauke has been campaigning against him even in advanceof formally claiming the GOP nomination Tuesday night.   Republicans profess hope for knocking off two-term Democrat MaxBaucus in Montana, as well. The victor in a four-way GOP race wasLt. Gov. Allen Kolstad, who entered the race at the urging of thenational Republican leadership.   In New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman was unopposed for the GOPnomination to oppose Bradley. In Alabama, state Sen. Bill Cabannishad no GOP opposition for the chance to challenge Heflin.   GOP Sen. Domenici in New Mexico will face Democratic State Sen.Tom Benavides, who was unopposed for his party's nomination.   On the other side of the aisle, Democrats eye Pressler of SouthDakota as a potential victim for the fall. Ted Muenster, who had noprimary opposition, will run against him.   In New Mexico's governor's race, former Gov. Bruce King won theDemocratic nomination in a bid to regain the office he's held foreight years _ longer than anyone in state history. Former state Rep.Frank Bond won the Republican nomination. Each man defeated threerivals.</TEXT></DOC>
