The coal measures are covered by some 80 m ofwater bearing strata. The ground is therefore to be frozen to permitshaft sinking through the water bearing strata. Eighty five 200 mm holeshave been drilled. Each contains a pair of freeze pipes. These pipeswill be fed with brine from a freezing plant on the surface. To reducethe time taken for the freeze and permit work to continue on the surface,the ground will be frozen from a depth of 275 m, where a freeze chamberhas been constructed. Inaccurate positioning and drilling of the freezeholes would prolong the time needed to freeze the ground, and delay thecompletion of the mine. It was therefore vital to monitor and controlthe direction of the holes drilled. Various methods were used to monitorthe progress of each freeze hole and correct any deviations from intendedposition. As a result, only one of the original eighty four holes hashad to be re-drilled. 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
