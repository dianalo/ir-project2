From the end of World War II until the 1970s, annually about 20% of the U.S. population changed residences.    During the 1970s and early 1980s, however, the &quot;geographic mobility rate&quot; drifted as low as 16%, the Census Bureau says. Bureau demographers believe that rising housing costs, especially high interest rates, made lots of people postpone moves, the bulk of which are local and tend to be more discretionary than long-distance ones.    Newly released figures show American mobility snapping back to more traditional levels, with 20.2% of the population moving in 1985, compared with 17.3% a year earlier. The Census Bureau, which has been charting household moves since 1948, finds the year-to-year increase of three percentage points &quot;unprecedented,&quot; says Larry Long, of the bureau's Center for Demographic Studies. The mobility rise followed a sharp drop in mortgage rates from unusually high levels. Mr. Long speculates that many potential movers were simply waiting for housing to become more affordable.    Long-distance moves in 1984-85 marked the first time in several decades that the South didn't score a big population gain. Some 1.3 million people moved into Southern states, but nearly as many, 1.2 million, moved out, most to the Midwest and West. Census demographers say they aren't sure whether this shift in Southern net migration is a one-year statistical aberration or the start of a significant trend.    Shift to the Sun   Belt For Congressional Seats   POLITICIANS are starting to speculate how the population drift toward the Sun Belt during the 1980s will alter the balance of power in Congress. If state population trends continue as they have so far this decade, California would gain six seats in the House of Representatives in the 1990s. Two other Sun Belt states with prospective big gains in House seats are Texas, with four, and Florida, with three. Arizona, Georgia and Virginia each would add one seat.    The rejiggering of House membership comes in 1991, when states redraw congressional and legislative district lines based on the 1990 census. Since House membership is a permanent 435, states that saw an exodus of people in the 1980s will lose seats to states where population grew.    Election Data Services Inc., a political consulting firm in Washington, has figured the size of each state's delegation in Congress in the 1990s, using 1986 Census Bureau population totals. The big losers are in the Frost Belt: New York would drop three House seats, and Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania two each. Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Wisconsin would lose one seat apiece.    Ride-Sharing Incentives   To Cut Los Angeles Smog   MANY communities encourage voluntary car-pooling. In the smog-choked Los Angeles area, that encouragement is soon to be the law. By next Jan. 1, companies with more than 500 workers in a four-county area in and around Los Angeles must offer tangible rewards aimed at persuading employees who normally drive to work alone to join car pools or to ride buses or bicycles. Possible lures: cash bonuses, free gasoline, bus passes, choice parking spots in the company lot, and showers for bikers.    By 1990, the policy will cover companies with more than 100 workers in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties and the urban areas of San Bernardino County. That's roughly 8,000 employers with 1.5 million workers, or 40% of the area's commuters.    The ride-sharing rules, supported by most businesses as a cost-effective way to reduce both smog and rush-hour bottlenecks, are the strictest adopted so far in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency sees the plan as a potential model for communities elsewhere troubled with pollution or traffic congestion.    Enforcing the strategy is the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which was given expanded powers by the California legislature last year to deal with smog in the Los Angeles Basin, the nation's No. 1 air pollution problem. Companies have broad discretion in crafting incentives, but the air quality district will rule on each firm's plan and audit the firm for compliance.    Workers aren't required to accept the incentives, but companies are required to file a plan. &quot;Our experience is that when incentives are offered, people reconsider their commuting options,&quot; says Thomas Eichhorn, the district's spokesman.    Helping Small Businesses   Trade in Foreign Markets   EXPORTING is standard fare for big manufacturers like Boeing or Caterpillar, but for a smaller outfit in, say, Columbus, Ohio, plunging into foreign trade with its letters of credit and exchange-rate exposure may be daunting. Finding a commercial bank to arrange and finance a trade deal of less than $1 million can also be tough.    The U.S. Export-Import Bank is trying to ease the pain with one-year pilot programs in three states -- Massachusetts, Maryland and California -- and three cities -- Columbus, Los Angeles, and Tucson, Ariz. The Ex-Im Bank provides a specialist to lead would-be exporters through the paperwork maze involved in loans to foreign buyers and working-capital guarantees. The states and cities support the project with money and professional services.    Says Raymond Lorello, Columbus's development director: &quot;Our argument is that the $100,000 deal today may grow into the $1 million deal tomorrow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
