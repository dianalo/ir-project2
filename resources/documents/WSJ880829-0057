Economists expect the August unemployment rate and payroll employment due out Friday to match or come close to matching the strong showing of recent months. The consensus view expects an unemployment rate to be unchanged at 5.4%. And, economists figure about 230,000 to 250,000 new non-farm jobs were created in August. During July a solid 283,000 jobs were added.    With unemployment hovering near a 14-year low, wages have begun to creep higher and jobs have become a focal point for policy-making.    The Federal Reserve has shown its alarm over wage inflation by nudging interest rates higher in an attempt to cool economic growth. Many economists believe low unemployment rates cause wages to rise, which in turn fuels inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan already has singled out the jobless rate as an area that needs &quot;leveling&quot; in order to avoid more intense inflationary pressures. So, it isn't surprising that many economists and traders think another interest rate increase is likely if August employment is again robust. The Fed last raised the discount rate Aug. 9 by a half-point, to 6.5%. The nation's banks moved two days later to boost the prime rate to 10% -- its highest level in three years.    But some economists say inflationary pressures could be abated by better manufacturing productivity levels.    &quot;Wages are picking up. But as long as productivity picks up, too, you don't have a problem,&quot; said Lincoln Anderson, an economist with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    During the second quarter, manufacturing productivity rose a bit higher than did wages. So, unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at a 0.6% annual rate in the second quarter, after rising at a 2.2% rate during the first period. &quot;That's the true measure of cost-push,&quot; added Mr. Anderson. Overall productivity declined in the second quarter, largely because of waning productivity in the service sector.    Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, concurs that productivity gains have helped take the sting out of rising wages. &quot;Thus far, the pressure hasn't been that great,&quot; he said. Still, he noted wage growth bears watching closely.    One report Mr. Obrinsky doesn't watch closely also hits the data banks this week -- the index of leading indicators. &quot;I don't pay any attention to it, except I hope it goes up because everybody feels better that way,&quot; he said.    But the July reading of the leading indicators index, due out tomorrow, is expected to decline, as many of its components already have reported in at lower levels. The negative influences on the index include higher initial unemployment claims, falling building permits, faster vendor performance, lower stock prices and decreased money supply.    The consensus view calls for a drop of 0.7% in the July index. In June, the index rose 1.4% in the biggest increase since December 1986.    Economists at Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co. figure that a decline in the July indicators could be forming a top. Such a move would fit with Brown Brothers' projection for a &quot;pause&quot; in economic growth in late 1989 or 1990, they added.    Two other series that had big gains in June -- manufacturing orders and new home sales -- are expected to show a marked decline in the July report.    In June, factory orders jumped 5.5% in the biggest one-month increase in 18 years. Economists attributed the increase to the timing of major, one-time aircraft and defense orders. For the same reason, economists expect a knee-jerk reaction with a decline in the July total, due out tomorrow. The consensus view calls for a drop of 3.5%.    The July report on homes, due out today, is expected to show a sharp drop from June's 734,000 units. Economists at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. figure new home sales dropped about 6.5% to 685,000 units.    Inflation could get another jolt from August's agricultural prices, due out tomorrow. Drought-driven farm prices are expected to leap an additional 2% or more. In July, farm prices climbed 3.6% as grain supplies were reduced by drought damage.    ---   SERVICE PULSE: The service sector leading index compiled by the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University grew at an annual rate of 2.5% in July, up from a revised 1.3% in June. Still, the performance has been relatively subdued since November of last year, suggesting that service sector activity may moderate by the end of the year or early in 1989, the center said. The coincident index grew at an annual rate of 4.4% in July, up from 3.6% in June, it added. </TEXT></DOC>
