Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Al From is the cheerful Sisyphus of the Democratic Party. With an earnestness as broad as his smile, he keeps trying to push his party up into America's political mainstream, but every four years it rolls back down to the left. As a living fossil known as a Democratic &quot;moderate,&quot; Mr. From can claim a unique mandate for explaining why, as he puts it, &quot;every four years the Democrats go into fantasyland.&quot;    By some lights, of course, no such explanation is needed. The New York Times is already rehabilitating Michael Dukakis as a &quot;centrist,&quot; but if that's true why are Democrats now grabbing every reporter in town to whisper, &quot;Sam Nunn for vice president&quot;? To those of us in the mainstream, the critical statistic from Tuesday's New York primary wasn't so much 37% (Jesse Jackson's share of the vote) as 88%, the share won by the two left-liberal candidates, Messrs. Dukakis and Jackson.    To the left, of course -- and I tend to agree -- this result proves little more than that the soul of the party is liberal. They repeat Barry Goldwater's injunction that their party should offer a &quot;choice not an echo.&quot; There are at least a few Democrats, however, who aren't so sure that the term &quot;Jackson Democrats&quot; should yet be rechristened to refer to Jesse rather than to the late Sen. &quot;Scoop.&quot;    Mr. From is one of those few, but then he has a history of heresy. In 1984, he endured sneers for declaring as early as the Democratic convention that the party's Mondale wing was enjoying its &quot;last hurrah.&quot; A year later, he joined with fellow moderates such as Sen. Nunn and former Virginia governor Chuck Robb to establish and become director of the Democratic Leadership Council, as a vehicle to move the party back to the center. The left pilloried them as &quot;pale Republicans&quot; and a &quot;conservative white caucus.&quot; The DLC persevered, even influencing candidates such as Al Gore and Bruce Babbitt, but here in April 1988 neither Mr. Dukakis nor Mr. Jackson sounds at all like the DLC platform.    So what happened? Mr. From starts with some history. When the great Roosevelt coalition shattered in the 1960s, he says, the party consensus shattered as well. The post-Vietnam generation turned isolationist. Organized labor, which had been a force for internationalism, was buffeted in the 1970s by economic change and turned protectionist. A &quot;cultural radicalism&quot; also infected the party, he says, producing other special interests. The traditional Democratic message of &quot;economic growth with equity&quot; and national strength got lost amid the kaleidoscope of demands.    This &quot;balkanization,&quot; he says, has become institutionalized in the Democratic nominating process. The decline of winner-take-all primaries means even candidates who lose primaries can capture delegates and take them to the convention. Congresspersons or other elected Democrats, who once were able to broker the special interests, are now allowed only bit roles. Worse, state caucuses (as opposed to primaries) increase the influence of the most committed activists, who are usually liberal or represent special interests or both.    &quot;We now have a process -- and we thought we hit rock bottom in 1984,&quot; Mr. From says, &quot;where the independent strands of the Democratic Party can go all the way to the convention without having to form coalitions with other parts of the party.&quot; The result is a convention dominated by activists to the left of the Democratic rank and file. Mr. From cites a 1984 ABC poll in which more than twice as many convention delegates as rank-and-file Democrats wanted a tax increase.    Another result is a primary campaign in which Democratic candidates feel they must project an increasingly liberal message; yet that message attracts even fewer non-liberal Democrats. Across the South on Super Tuesday, Mr. From says, exit polls showed that fewer Democratic primary voters than ever identified themselves as &quot;conservative.&quot; Those who identified themselves as &quot;liberal&quot; jumped by as many as 18 percentage points this year compared with 1984. Fewer Democrats in the South even bothered to vote this year as well. Yet Mr. From argues that it is precisely these non-liberal &quot;swing voters&quot; that his party must have to win in November. These are the people, he says, who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but switched to Senate Democrats in 1986.    Despite the leftward tilt of the primary campaign, however, Mr. From still isn't conceding victory to George Bush. He thinks Mr. Bush is vulnerable on the economy, among other things, and he thinks Mr. Dukakis already has made progress by refusing to make Mr. Mondale's mistake of appeasing every special pleader. &quot;In 1984 I thought there was just no hope of broadening the coalition,&quot; he says. &quot;This time I think it's possible. . . . He's not a Mondale. He's much more growth-oriented. He talks about using government to enhance opportunity.&quot;    That still leaves Mr. Dukakis's left-wing views on foreign policy, of course, which include such insights as substituting the Rio Treaty for the Monroe Doctrine, and opposition to most U.S. nuclear weapons. Mr. From concedes the problem, but like so many other Democrats this week he proposes the lightning-bolt solution -- Sen. Nunn for vice president. &quot;There'd be a huge sigh of relief if he named Nunn,&quot; he says.    The problem with that, of course, is that there might also be a huge cry of protest from the left, the special interests, and especially from the Rev. Jackson. To us mainstreamers, Mr. From may have the most appealing analysis, but Mr. Jackson still has the delegates. </TEXT></DOC>
