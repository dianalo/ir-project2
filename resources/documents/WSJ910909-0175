Drawing on birth and other records published since 1979,Renbao Chen and S. Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earliertrend toward postponing their first birth, while white womenover 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first birthsthan over-30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking tocatch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women -- blacks,Asians and others -- also tended to have their first childrenat somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.   But at every age from the teens on, blacks and othernonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birththan were white women of the same age. For example, in 1987 a20-year-old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to haveher first child in the following year as was a 20-year-oldwhite woman, while a 25-year-old nonwhite woman was about 11/2 times more likely to be having her first child than herwhite counterpart.   The research also showed that nonwhite women now have farlower rates of childlessness than white women. Historically,blacks had far higher rates, due largely to health and otherinvoluntary factors. This situation started reversing in the1950s, and the difference has grown greater as more whitewomen have forgone having children altogether. In 1987, forinstance, a white woman born in 1954 was better than threetimes more likely to be childless than a 33-year-oldnonwhite.                                                                                                          Farm Belt Holds Onto   Its Oldest Americans                                                                                                          THE OLDEST old, those 85 or more, bulk largest in the FarmBelt, 1990 census figures show.   Not surprisingly, the largest numbers of 85-plus men andwomen are found in the most populous states: New York,California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,Michigan. In each of these, people 85 and over total wellinto six figures.   Looked at as a percentage of a state's population,however, a much different picture emerges. In 14 states, the85-and-older group accounts for 1.5% or more of the totalpopulation. Iowa leads with 2.0%, closely followed by SouthDakota and Nebraska with 1.9%, North Dakota with 1.8% andKansas with 1.7%.   In nine other states, including Arkansas, Missouri,Minnesota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, the oldest old account for1.6% or 1.5% of the total. The other states in this categoryare East Coast: Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts andMaine. Alaska, by contrast, is at the bottom of the ranking,with only 0.2% of its population 85 or older.   Much the same states rank at or near the top in thepercentage of total state population living in nursing homes.The Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,Wisconsin, Montana and Rhode Island are the only states withat least 1% of their populations living in nursing homes.Census Bureau specialist Cynthia Taeuber says most nursinghome residents are 85 or older.   So why do the oldest old figure so heavily in thesestates? Ms. Taeuber hypothesizes that in most of these statesyounger adults move out to seek better job opportunities,while the older natives stay and age in place, inevitablyconstituting a larger share of the total. And with theirchildren moved away, many end up in nursing homes.   Another census report says that the number ofcentenarians, men and women 100 or older, more than doubledbetween 1980 and 1990, increasing to 35,808 from an estimated14,000 to 16,000. (There was no precise count in 1980.) Morethan 28,000 of the 35,808 were women, and well over 29,000 ofthe total were white.                                                                                                          Golf Has More Players,   Who Play More Often                                                                                                          MORE PEOPLE are playing golf, and most are playing moreoften, a recreation specialist reports.   Rod Warnick, a University of Massachusetts professor whotracks leisure trends, calculates that the number of adultgolfers increased about 6% a year in the 1980s to 22.2million, while the number of days played grew about 7%annually to 393.7 million. Moreover, he notes, the number of&quot;heavy&quot; golfers, those playing 20 or more times a year, greweven faster, more than doubling to 6.8 million, while thenumber of days these avid golfers played increased about 8%annually to almost 300 million days.   Mr. Warnick says the growth of leisure time, theincreasing numbers of retirees and the aging of the babyboomers all contributed. He also finds that more women andminorities have taken up the game -- a trend he sees as aptto lead to further anti-discrimination suits against golfclubs and courses that aren't fully integrated or given toequal treatment.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MOBILE HOMES make up 7% of the nation's housing inventory,the Census Bureau reports. This is the fastest-growing typeof housing, up 60% since 1980. . . . Athletes who play hardto win are more apt to get hurt than those who just play forfun, University of Florida researchers find. They say thosewho take a game too much to heart are more likely to putthemselves in a risky situation in an effort to come outahead. . . . Diseases and other causes of disability in women65 and older will be the subject of a seven-year study by theJohns Hopkins School of Medicine under a contract with thegovernment's National Institute on Aging. About two-thirds ofall disabled older people are female.</TEXT></DOC>
