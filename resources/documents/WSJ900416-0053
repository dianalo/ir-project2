Probably not. The petroleum futures exchanges areseriously studying the addition of a contract to representthe sour crudes -- those with high sulfur content. &quot;Sourcrude is a high priority,&quot; said an official of theInternational Petroleum Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   The London-based exchange is looking at severalpossibilities among the sour grades -- perhaps even a packageof crudes. But the most likely candidate for the contract isthe Dubai sour crude, perhaps to be traded on the Singaporeexchange. Dubai is an important Middle East petroleum --already ranked among the world's benchmark crudes -- that isproduced in the United Arab Emirates.   Two other benchmark crudes currently are traded in thefutures market. The North Sea's Brent is listed on London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange. West Texas Intermediate,the U.S. benchmark crude, is on the New York MercantileExchange.   As a futures commodity, West Texas Intermediate has been asmashing success. It isn't unusual for a day's volume in WTIfutures trading to number more than 100,000 contracts of1,000 barrels each. That's nearly double the petroleum theworld actually uses each day.   But both WTI and Brent are light &quot;sweet&quot; crudes, low indensity and in sulfur. Priced at a premium, they yield morepreferred fuels such as gasoline. Also, they are importantfor environmental reasons. They pollute less than high-sulfuroil.   As a result, the sour crudes are responsible for thecurrent oil glut. The refiners mainly want sweet oil. Thathas meant a widening gap between the prices paid for thesweet and sour crudes, currently as much as $4 or $5 abarrel. &quot;The sweet crudes have decoupled from the sours,&quot;said Humphrey Harrison, a London-based oil analyst, &quot;butthere is still a need for a futures market for sour crudes.&quot;   Indeed, the world's future oil needs will have to be metmore and more by the sour crudes. There isn't going to bemuch choice.   The world's crude stream is growing heavier. Most reservesthat will have to be tapped in the years ahead are in theMiddle East and are considered heavy, or dense, crudes. Mostare high in sulfur. Six of every 10 barrels produced by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are in theheavy or sour crude categories.   Dubai is a relatively light crude. Its density is on parwith that of Arabian Light. Still, the sulfur content makesit a sour crude. But whether it's Dubai or not, oil analystsexpect that a sour crude will be added by one of thepetroleum exchanges soon.   The betting is on Singapore. The Singapore InternationalMonetary Exchange, or Simex, is succeeding in the futurestrading of a high-sulfur residual fuel oil contract launchedmore than a year ago. There have been some problems, but theSimex contract is doing much better than similar heavyfuel-oil trading offered on the International PetroleumExchange or the New York Merc. The Rotterdam Energy FuturesExchange in Holland abandoned its fuel oil contract recently.   The Simex will get considerable support if it does offer acrude contract. The government and a growing community of oiltraders in Singapore back the idea, and the islandcity-state's refineries process a lot of crude from theMiddle East.   The Simex itself already has endorsed the introduction ofa Dubai contract, although there are certain remainingapprovals to be obtained. Such a sour-crude contract could betraded soon. &quot;We are looking at a time frame of sometimebefore June 1,&quot; Frankie Lim Choo Beng, the Simex vicepresident-energy futures, said in a recent interview.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          If the dollar resumes climbing, it will be &quot;the deathknell&quot; for gold, says William O'Neill, director of futuresresearch at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.   Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase ManhattanBank, says this is a testing time for gold: &quot;Gold needs aconvincing move to the upside to dissipate the negativesentiment that has built up.&quot; June-delivery gold rose $1.30an ounce Thursday to $379.70.   Frank Taucher notes in his &quot;1990 Supertrader's Almanac&quot;that over the past five years, if one contract ofJune-delivery gold were sold on April 15 (April 16 this year)and bought back May 31, an average profit of $968 would havebeen reaped (before commissions). The worst paper lossexperienced on a daily closing-price basis was $560. Mr.Taucher cautions that seasonal trades don't necessarilyrepeat each year. But he believes that traders contemplatingentering any market should be aware of seasonal patterns.   Copper                                                                                                          According to Michael Frawley, metals trader at PaineWebberInc. in New York, the market will be watching two barometersdue out tomorrow: the stockpile levels to be announced by theLondon Metals Exchange and the disclosure of the offers tosell copper to the U.S. Mint.   The London Metals Exchange usually announces its warehousestocks Monday but because the exchange is closed today forEaster, the data will be released tomorrow. Last week, rumorsof an impending increase in stockpiles kept the market onedge.   Periodically, Mr. Frawley said, the Mint accepts forpurchase 4,000 tons of copper for its coin manufacturingoperations. On Tuesday at 11 a.m. EST when the Mint opensoffers, he said, speculators will be watching closely to seethe prices at which copper has been tendered to the Mint.   The tender &quot;is a good indication of how strong the marketis, and I think it will set the tone for the balance of theweek,&quot; says Mr. Frawley. Copper has a tendency to peak aroundthis time of the year, he adds.   Mr. Taucher confirms that belief. He says in his almanacthat over the past five years, if May-delivery copper weresold April 15 (April 16 this year) and bought back April 30,an average profit of $788 a contract would have been realized(before commissions). The worst paper loss experienced on adaily closing-price basis was $138.   Seasonal trading is used by many traders in the commoditymarkets. Usually it is combined with other technical tradingtechniques to determine precise entry and exit points.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Cattle traders this week will formulate their estimates ofthe size of the herd being fattened for slaughter in 13 majorcattle-producing states.   On Friday, the Agriculture Department is slated to releaseits quarterly survey after the close of trading.   The early speculation is that the department will probablyreport that the number of cattle on feedlots on April 1 roseslightly from the same 1989 date.   The department is also expected to report that the numberof young cattle placed on feedlots, as well as the number offattened cattle sold from feedlots to slaughterhouses, fellduring the quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
