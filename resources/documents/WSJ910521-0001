Junk bonds, which hit rock bottom late last year, enjoyeda breathtaking run during the first four months of this yearas growing optimism about the economy and the end of thePersian Gulf war triggered a buying spree. According to FirstBoston Corp.'s junk bond index, high-yield bonds posted a4.2% total return in April, the fourth straight month thejunk market generated a positive return.   But in recent weeks, sliding stock prices, a spate ofprofit-taking and growing concern about renewed selling ofhigh-yield holdings by insurance companies depressed pricesof high-risk junk bonds.   Junk bond mutual fund managers, who poured money into thehigh-yield market earlier this year, aren't flinching. Theysay the recent slide is just a simple case of an overheatedmarket.   &quot;I think the {high-yield} market in general is taking apause much like the equity market is and trying to figure outwhere the economy is headed,&quot; says Mark Durbiano, a portfoliomanager at Pittsburgh-based Federated Research Corp. The firmmanages $450 million in junk bond funds.   Mr. Durbiano says investors are now &quot;on the fence&quot;wondering if the economy will pick up soon, as many punditsargue, or deteriorate more before rebounding.   Partly because of the uncertain outlook and partly out ofa desire to take profits, Mr. Durbiano says Federatedrecently trimmed its limited holdings in cyclical bonds likeAmerican Standard Inc., Quantum Chemical Corp. and FormicaCorp.   At the same time, the company started buying what Mr.Durbiano calls &quot;fairly recession-resistant&quot; names like RalphsGrocery Co. and Hospital Corp. of America. &quot;We're not raisingmoney. We're just moving the bets around a bit,&quot; he says.   Anticipating that the top tier of the high-yield marketwill outperform the lower tier during the second half of theyear, Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. hasfocused on better-quality names.   A spokesman for the mutual fund manager says the dwindlingsupply of top-quality junk bonds combined with the potentialfor credit rating upgrades in this sector will make thesebonds attractive during the second part of the year.   Over the next three months, T. Rowe Price anticipates thatabout 10% of its $727 million junk bond fund will be called.   Joan Batchelder, a senior vice president at MassachusettsFinancial Services Co., which manages about $1.5 billion in avariety of junk bond funds, says while she is &quot;cautious&quot; onsome individual junk bond names, she is &quot;constructive&quot; aboutthe market in general.   The market &quot;has come awfully far in a very short period oftime and I think it's time to look at the high-yield marketon a name-by-name basis,&quot; said Ms. Batchelder. Among thesectors she likes are cable television and supermarkets. Shenotes those sectors have performed well during the recession.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended mostly little changed in quiet trading.   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at a price of 986/32 to yield 8.28%, up very slightly from 98 5/32 to yield8.28% on Friday. Shorter-term securities ended mixed, withsome issues posting slight gains and others posting slightlosses.   The only excitement in the market occurred shortly afternoon EDT when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan'swritten responses to a senator's queries were released.   Brian Keyser, economist at CRT Government Securities Inc.,said that prices rose modestly due to perceptions that Mr.Greenspan seems a little uncertain about the prospects foreconomic growth.   &quot;But that blew over real quick,&quot; said Mr. Keyser.   Mr. Greenspan, in a May 13 letter responding to a queryfrom Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.), about the adequacy ofactions to foster additional lending by banks and thrifts,said: &quot;Although the actions taken by the Federal Reserve inmonetary policy and by all the agencies regulatingdepositories may well be sufficient to foster an adequatesupply of credit to fuel economic recovery, we recognize therisks that they may not be enough.&quot;   Meanwhile, yields were slightly higher on two Treasuryissues scheduled to be sold this week. In when-issuedtrading, yields on the $12.25 billion of two-year notes dueto be sold tomorrow ended at 6.88%, up from 6.87%. Yields onthe $9.25 billion of five-year notes to be sold Thursday werequoted at 7.76%, up from 7.74%.   The Treasury sold $19.22 billion of bills yesterday. Hereare details of that auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                       13-Week          26-Week                                                                                                        Applications ............. $24,437,320,000  $22,424,740,000 Accepted bids ............  $9,616,295,000   $9,602,060,000 Accepted at low price ....             85%              44% Accepted noncompet'ly ....  $1,659,720,000   $1,153,565,000 Average price (Rate) .....  98.610 (5.50%)   97.139 (5.66%) High price (Rate) ........  98.617 (5.47%)   97.149 (5.64%) Low price (Rate) .........  98.610 (5.50%)   97.134 (5.67%) Coupon equivalent ........           5.67%            5.92% CUSIP number .............       912794XD1        912794WW0                                                                                                          Both issues are dated May 23, 1991. The 13-week billsmature Aug. 22, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 21,1991.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bonds slid as reported sales of high-yield bonds byWestinghouse Credit Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.depressed prices.   But even though the market slumped, the declines were notas steep as last week when tumbling stock prices sent junkbonds sharply lower.   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with lowcredit ratings or no credit ratings at all, finished off 1/4point.   Junk bond traders said Westinghouse Credit, a subsidiaryof Westinghouse Electric Corp., and the RTC, the federalagency set up to bail out the nation's thrifts, were in themarket seeking bids for a total of $40 million of high-yield,high-risk bonds.   Though the sales by the RTC couldn't be confirmed,Westinghouse Credit said it was active in the marketyesterday.   Junk bond traders said among the bonds Westinghouse wastrying to sell were issues from Owens-Illinois Inc., RalphsGrocery and Chicago andamp; Northwestern Holdings Corp.   None of the bonds showed significant declines despite thereported sales.   Other bonds that did lose ground were debt issues fromcyclical concerns like Container Corp. of America. ContainerCorp.'s 14% subordinated debentures, due in 2001, ended at 921/4, down two points from Friday.   Bonds from container companies have been declining eversince Gaylord Container Corp., the Deerfield, Ill., packagingconcern, currently mired in an industry downturn, skipped aninterest payment last week and unveiled debt-restructuringplans.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, prices ofhigh-grade bonds were little changed.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Most municipal bond prices ended little changed tomodestly lower.   Among actively traded issues, the Orange-Orlando counties,Florida Expressway Authority 6.5% securities of 2020 wereunchanged at 94 3/4, to yield 6.90%.   Elsewhere, in the New York market, yields on taxable NewYork City general obligation bonds have climbed about 0.20percentage point in the past two weeks due to concerns aboutthe city's finances and a weak Treasury bond market.   Yesterday, traders quoted yields on the taxable issuesmaturing in 20 years at 11.20%.   New York City has approximately $950 million of taxable GOdebt outstanding, according to an official in the citycomptroller's office. The city also may sell another $125million of taxable GOs before the end of the fiscal year onJune 30, according to a recent city budget document.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended lower.   In secondary trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 8.5% securities for June delivery were down 5/32at 97 11/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8.5%securities were off 2/32 at 99 26/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities were 3/32 lower at 9917/32.   Late in the session, 10-year Treasury notes were yielding8.09%, which was 0.94 percentage point lower than the yieldon Ginnie Mae 8.5% securities. That spread was 0.01percentage point wider than late Friday.   Traders reported a good response to a Resolution TrustCorp. sale of around $500 million from its mortgagesecurities portfolio.   RTC, the agency created to finance the thrift bailout,sold conventional mortgage securities after circulating a bidlist late last week.   In the asset-backed arena, more deals are on the horizon,with at least $1.5 billion of new securities backed by creditcards and home equity loans expected this week.
