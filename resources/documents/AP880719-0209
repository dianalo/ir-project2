Gary Hart.   Commission officials filed papers in U.S. District Court onMonday seeking to force Laguna Beach developer David Stein tocomply with a subpoena and to testify about ``fund raising,contributions and other activities, commercial or otherwise.''   The election commission said Stein invoked his Fifth Amendmentright against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he wasquestioned about the matter in April.   The allegations were reported in The Washington Post in January.Hart said at the time that he knew nothing about illegalcontributions and he directed his staff to return money improperlyobtained.   Stein's attorney, Paul Sullivan of Washington, D.C., said hisclient should not be subject to a civil investigation by theelection commission because he may be the target of a criminalinquiry by the FBI.   The commission stated in its court documents that it had reasonto believe Stein may have violated election laws barringcontributions of more than $1,000 to a single candidate andlimiting total individual contributions to $25,000.   The commission contends that Stein, 40, donated at least $38,750for the 1980 election, of which only $10,000 was refunded. Amongthe contributions were $1,000 to Hart's Americans With Hartcommittee; $25,000 to the Democratic National Committee; and $1,000to the Democratic Congressional Dinner Committee, along withcontributions of $1,000 and $500 to various individual candidates.   The commission documents state that Stein's efforts to``impermissibly aid'' the Hart campaign, ``may have beencoordinated with campaign personnel.''   The Orange County Register, reporting on the documents Tuesday,said Stein refused to discuss the matter with Register reportersMonday in Atlanta, where he is attending the Democratic NationalConvention as an uncommitted delegate.   The court documents also link Stein to Newport Beach videopromoter George Stuart Karl, who was indicted last month by afederal grand jury on charges that he illegally donated almost$200,000 to candidates, including Hart.   Among the items Stein refused to discuss during the Aprilquestioning was the purpose of a $30,000 check he wrote in 1984 toKarl's business, and what, if any, relationship the check had tothe Hart campaign, the documents said.   Election laws forbid corporate contributions of cash or servicesto campaigns.   The documents also accuse Stein of buying a computer from Hart's1984 presidential campaign and leasing it back for an amount farbelow the market rate.   If the commission determines that Stein violated federalelection laws, it could impose civil fines up to $10,000, and 20percent of the amount involved if the violation was found to beintentional.</TEXT></DOC>
