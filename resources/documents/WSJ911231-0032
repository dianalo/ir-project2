With the ranks of fired white-collar workers expanding,one must be willing to move, change industries or take a paycut, &quot;outplacement&quot; experts such as Right Associates say.Some may have to pay their own relocation costs, others warn.Higher-paid execs will take longer to find a job, accordingto Accountemps, in Troy, Mich., and Accountants on Call,Saddle Brook, N.J.</LP><TEXT>   It takes six to eight months to find a job, up from fourto six months a year ago, consultant Lee Hecht Harrisonreports. Others say it is even longer. Many companies stoppedadvertising job openings, fearing a resume deluge.   But a Lee Hecht Harrison survey shows that of 100 recentlyfired financial-services employees, 53 got jobs at higherpay, while 26 took cuts.                                                                                                          WHAT YOU CAN DO says a lot about your job-findingprospects.   Laid-off health-care and biotechnology workers are in goodshape, but &quot;just about everything else is in a decline,&quot; saysRobert Lewis, who heads placement firm Drake Beam Morin'sAtlanta office. People with profit-impacting skills, such assalespeople or loan-workout experts, do better thangeneralists like corporate planners or training officials,say Right Associates and Lee Hecht Harrison.   Those who have worked for a company more than 10 yearswill find it harder to adjust &quot;in this climate,&quot; says SalesExecutives, also of Troy, Mich. &quot;Someone who hasn't adaptedto changes in technology will have the hardest time finding ajob,&quot; adds Judy James, of Accountemps.                                                                                                          DRESSING DOWN: Employers relax some office-clothing rules.   Many, like Mellon Bank and InaCom, a computer-productscompany in Omaha, Neb., create &quot;casual days&quot; each week ormonth. But Mellon workers wearing informal garb must give tothe United Way; and shorts, halter tops, and jeans with holesare taboo. Alcoa said in October it is all right to dresscasually. A spokesman says more men are wearing sweaters andslacks; he can't tell if women have dressed down, since theirdress code was always murky.   Eastman Kodak's Landamp;F Products division eased its code lastsummer, when the air conditioner broke at its Montvale, N.J.,headquarters; the relaxed code stuck. In a poll of 201companies by sneaker maker Converse, 55% favor casualexecutive styles, to bolster morale. Men are replacing suitswith jackets and sporting more-colorful ties, if any, andshirts. More women wear dresses, short skirts, or casualshoes.   But at Southland Corp. and Storage Technology, suits andties for men and suits or dresses for women are still theorder of the day.                                                                                                          A POSITIVE NOTE: Some 45% of 2,200 owners of smallercompanies, with annual sales typically below $100 million,said they plan to increase their full-time employment bymid-1992, despite doubting how long an economic recoverywould take, in a survey by consultant BDO Seidman. Only 11%planned cuts. Finding or keeping good workers is a bigconcern.                                                                                                          A NEGATIVE BOND? Many workers may find it tough to changejobs because a prospective employer won't provide healthcoverage for existing illnesses. A survey of 1,003 companiesby accountant KPMG Peat Marwick found that about 68% ofemployees are subject to those clauses, especially in theSouth and West.                                                                                                          WATCHING VDTs more closely, 20 states considered 41proposals to regulate the use of video display terminals in1991, up from 11 states in 1990, the Center for OfficeTechnology, a private group, said. Two enacted laws beefed upMaine's VDT operator training law and created a Rhode Islandcommission to study back and wrist disorders.   SALARY INCREASES for most executives around the world willoutpace expected inflation in 1992, surveys by consultantsHewitt Associates and William M. Mercer show. The Mercersurvey projects an average rise of 5%, vs. 4% inflation inthe U.S.; 5.5% vs. 2.5% in Japan; 5% vs. 3.5% in Germany, and9% vs. 4% in Taiwan.                                                                                                          THE GLASS CEILING impedes women's rise in state and localgovernments, too.   That is the conclusion of a bulletin of the Center forWomen in Government, a unit of the State University of NewYork's Albany branch. Women held 31% and men 69% of topadministrative jobs in those governments in 1990, the studyshowed. White women held 24% of the top positions, but 30% ofother jobs; black women were 5% of managers, but 10% of otherjob holders.   The percentage of women was even smaller in stategovernments: 29% in top jobs, vs. 50% of other employees.Women represented 38% of high county jobs, but 53% of therest of the county work force, where more employees dotraditional &quot;female&quot; health and welfare work. Women were 26%of top city officials, close to their 28% of city forces.   Elected officials in 1991 named women to 20%, 19% and 13%of state, county and municipal chief administrative posts,respectively.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: About 7% of more than 500 companies surveyedby consultant William M. Mercer now give special incentivesto executives who help sell a substantial company asset. . .. A Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute automation center boaststhat it has developed the only five-fingered industrial robothand that is anatomically correct and fully functional.</TEXT></DOC>
