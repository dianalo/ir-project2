DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The out-of-court settlement of the government'scivil racketeering case against the Teamsters may lead the nation'slargest union into ``the mainstream of honest unionism,'' a federaljudge says.   ``The leaders of this union have today done their members a greatservice,'' U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said Tuesdaybefore signing the settlement.   In signing the pact, reached just before the case was to go totrial Monday, Edelstein noted that the union ``has had a long andsordid career of corruption and involvement with criminal elements.''   But in agreeing to the settlement, which will implement sweepingreforms including the direct election of the union's top leadership,Teamsters officials were promising to keep the 1.6 million memberorganization ``free from the influence of organized crime,'' saidthe judge.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the settlement ``represents amajor milestone in the government's 30-year war to clean uppervasive La Cosa Nostra corruption in the Teamster's union.''   Asked if the war was over, however, Romano conceded ``No.''   James Grady, the union's general counsel, called the agreement``satisfactory.''   But Teamsters President William J. McCarthy, one of theindividual defendants in the case, was less enthusiastic.   ``While I reluctantly accept the terms of the consent order, Ibelieve it is not the vindication and exoneration Teamsters deserve.The fact is this suit should never have been filed in the firstplace,'' McCarthy said in a statement.   Under the tentative agreement, three court-appointed watchdogswill oversee the entire union for three years.   Edelstein, who received the settlement Monday afternoon, delayedapproving it to clarify ambiguities.   The main change, made at the judge's request, was that thegovernment and the Teamsters will agree on two names to submit tothe judge for each of the watchdog positions, so that six namesinstead of three will be offered for the three posts.   The lawsuit, filed last June, sought to oust the union'sallegedly mob-influenced executive board. It claimed the Teamsters'leadership had been dominated by organized crime, which ``deprivedunion members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering''and a ``campaign of fear'' that included 20 murders, dozens ofbombings, beatings, bribes, extortion and theft.   Most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants weredismissed when they either agreed, or were ordered, to drop anyinvolvement with the Teamsters. Five, including convicted Colombocrime family boss Carmine ``Junior'' Persico, have been severed fromthe case and are to be tried later.   As a result of the agreement, the union's top leaders will beelected directly by the membership in secret ballot votes beginningin 1991.   Currently, delegates to the national convention pick theexecutive board members by roll call vote.   The three overseers will be appointed for three years by thejudge with the joint approval of both sides. One would investigateand prosecute alleged union corruption, one would administerdisciplinary action and the third would oversee elections.   After the 1991 union elections are certified, the overseers willbe replaced by an independent review board empowered to investigateand remedy allegations of corruption.   The reforms, said the judge, ``affords some hope that the unionwill become part of the mainstream of honest unionism.''</TEXT></DOC>
