A defense attorney argued that the 7-week-old trial was apolitical action in which the state seeks to shift blame for thedisaster.   ``Maybe the state hopes the people will look the other way whenit comes to their responsibility,'' defense attorney Dick Madsondeclared in his final argument.   Madson said crew members were not the only ones who saw thatHazelwood wasn't impaired aboard the Exxon Valdez when it struck acharted reef a year ago Saturday. He pointed to 21 witnesses atHazelwood's criminal trial who said the captain was sober andshowed no signs of being impaired by alcohol.   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said it was not necessaryto show that Hazelwood looked intoxicated to have been impaired bydrink.   ``The state has to prove he was under the influence ofintoxicating liquor,'' Cole said. He said this did not mean that``a person is stumbling, falling down, and needs support.''Instead, Cole argued, impairment means ``when your physicial andmental abilities are impaired.''   Cole asked jurors to determine that Hazelwood was impaired fromhis actions and from a blood test taken 10{ hours after the shipripped its hull open on a reef in Prince William Sound.   Following arguments, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstoneinstructed jurors on the law for about an hour, then told them toselect a foreman and begin their deliberations.   They spent about 10 minutes behind closed doors, then retiredfor the day. They were to resume Wednesday morning.   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony,criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment,operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge ofoil. If convicted, he could receive 7\ years in prison and $61,000in fines.   After the ship ran aground, it spilled nearly 11 million gallonsof Alaska North Slope crude oil, blackening hundreds of miles ofshoreline and killing fish, birds and other wildlife.   Madson urged jurors to ignore efforts to make Hazelwood out asthe villain.   ``Alaska is known as the last frontier,'' he said. ``We don'thave vigilantes or lynch mobs. What this frontier does is grant afair trial to everyone _ even people who transport what they callblack gold.   ``Captain Hazelwood is entitled to that fairness,'' Madson said.   He reminded jurors that their verdict cannot change or improvewhat happened in Prince William Sound. ``That is over and done,''Madson said.   Many parties had an interest in seeing Hazelwood blamed for thedisaster, and among them might be Exxon itself, Madson said inresponse to prosecution claims that Exxon wants the skipperacquitted.   Madson ridiculed any reliance on the delayed blood test. He saidthe calculations presented by a prosecution expert on how drunkHazelwood might have been were hard to believe.   ``Under the testimony you heard, Captain Hazelwood would havehad to be dragged up there (on the ship) by the collar. He wouldhave been so high at that blood alcohol level,'' Madson said.   He held up a picture of the ship's precarious gangway, which theskipper negotiated without a missed step, and declared, ``this isprobably the toughest sobriety test you're going to see.''   Cole said crew members who testified that the captain was soberwere probably influenced by Exxon to back up the skipper.   He asked the jury to notice ``the presence of Exxon in thiscase,'' and recalled the testimony of an Exxon executive who saidthe company has an interest in the outcome of Hazelwood's trial.   ``It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest inthis matter,'' Cole said. ``It's seeing Captain Hazelwood getacquitted.''   The prosecutor reminded jurors that crew members who testifiedsupported their captain on many issues, and sometimes changed thestories they had originally given about the grounding of the ExxonValdez.   Witnesses, for example, told the National Transportation SafetyBoard that the skipper tried to move the ship off the reef, butsome said on the stand that they did not know if he was tryingwhile others said he was not, Cole contended.   ``It's easy to see the pressure they (Exxon) were putting onthese crew members,'' said Cole as Exxon lawyers maintained theirdaily front-row vigil.   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker in Anchorage said he was notauthorized to comment on Cole's allegations and that Exxonofficials in Houston were not available.   Cole said Hazelwood risked his ship and the lives of his crew,and should be found guilty of reckless conduct.   Madson told jurors they could not ignore the testimony of the 21people, not all Exxon employees, who said he was sober. He saidjurors could not discount the opinions of experts who said that, ifthe skipper's instructions had been followed, the ship would havemissed Bligh Reef by two miles.   Hazelwood sat calmly at the defense table. His wife and father,who recently arrived at the trial, sat in back-row seats of thecrowded courtroom.</TEXT></DOC>
