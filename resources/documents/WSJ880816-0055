Corporate money is helping finance the red-cushioned chairs on which the delegates are sitting, the special $1 million television lighting system hanging over their heads and the sky-box hospitality suites plying them with good food and drink. It is paying for their meals, riverboat cruises and Dixieland bands at scores of &quot;invitation only&quot; receptions and dinners. And it accounts for more than $1 million to be raised at a &quot;gala&quot; this Thursday afternoon to help bankroll the fall campaign.    Both political parties, in fact, are squeezing big business for money harder than at any time since the Watergate scandal exposed widespread corporate political financing and prompted new campaign-finance laws. Now, thanks to new interpretations of those rules, the parties are out digging for company dollars again, even though they have already accepted $9.2 million each in public funds to finance their conventions. That money was intended to free them from special-interest support.    &quot;The thing has really exploded,&quot; says political scientist Herbert Alexander. He estimates each convention will cost more than $20 million, a good deal of it paid by corporate money.    Just like the old days, when the parties got military contractors and other businesses to buy expensive advertisements in convention programs, both the Republican and Democratic conventions have taken on the look of interest-group bazaars.    Yesterday, for example, the crowded calendar of events included: a &quot;jazz brunch&quot; in the French Quarter for Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson paid for by Allied-Signal; a dinner for the GOP leaders of the Senate and House, Robert Dole and Robert Michel, sponsored by the Food Marketing Institute; and various functions put on by, among others, the American Medical Association, Textron, US Sprint, Marine Midland Bank and the National Association of Broadcasters.    Republicans also are hustling for $100,000 corporate gifts for Thursday's gala. What does a company get for $100,000? A table at the event and the right to invite &quot;a dignitary of your choice&quot; from the ranks of prominent Republicans, a chance to pose for pictures with the presidential nominee, a special reception with President Reagan and a seat for a company executive at the head table.    Some donors say they contribute mainly to promote their products: Coke and Pepsi are donors, and are giving away soft drinks in big coolers at the convention site. Other companies, though, seem more intent on swaying government policy. Lobbyists say they aren't buying any favors, but do get special access to both federal and state-level government officials. Sometimes the relationships seem quite cozy.    Atlantic Richfield is among the biggest contributors at the GOP convention. The Los Angeles energy company is donating about $100,000, half of it to a fund paying for items such as chairs and lights. Atlantic Richfield's chairman, Lodwrick Cook, also heads the party's convention gala.    Such efforts aren't hurting Atlantic Richfield's standing with the GOP. A few weeks ago, George Bush appeared with Mr. Cook at a Los Angeles service station to open the company's first retail pump for methanol, which the vice president praised as a low-pollution fuel for the future. &quot;Nothing short of eliminating cars offers so much promise of eliminating smog,&quot; Mr. Bush said.    And today the delegates will approve a 30,000-word platform that includes phrases supporting one of Atlantic Richfield's main corporate goals: opening 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration. Without mentioning the refuge specifically, the platform endorses exploration on federal lands, &quot;especially in the Arctic.&quot; Environmentalists, who don't seem to be sponsoring any convention freebies, say drilling would thin the bird population and cut the birth rate for polar bears.    The GOP's acceptance of business money isn't drawing much protest from Democrats: They tapped corporations for millions at their own convention last month in Atlanta. Atlantic Richfield's manager of political affairs, George Dunn, says his company paid $75,000 into a Democratic Party fund and spent an additional $20,000 or so running a hospitality suite at the convention site.    In return, Atlantic Richfield executives got passes to big social events and to non-public areas in the convention hall where powerful Democrats gathered.    Meanwhile, dozens of other companies paid up to $20,000 per night to sponsor hospitality suites run by the party. Democrats also assessed business executives a &quot;registration fee&quot; of $425 each for hotel reservations and passes.    At the Republican Convention, corporations willing to pay $100,000 win the title &quot;Corporate Underwriter.&quot; For $50,000 a company can be a &quot;Corporate Patron,&quot; while $25,000 makes a donor a &quot;Corporate Sponsor.&quot; Atlantic Richfield's Mr. Dunn, who has spent time helping arrange the event, says the $100,000 donors include American Express, Brown-Forman, Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, PepsiCo, RJR Nabisco, Southern Co., Dresser Industries, Chevron.    By taking more and more corporate money, the parties are backsliding to the days before 1972, when a convention-financing scandal led to laws curtailing business donations. It was then that a memo from the typewriter of a Washington lobbyist, Dita Beard of International Telephone andamp; Telegraph, found its way into a Jack Anderson newspaper column. The document suggested that the Nixon administration gave ITT a favorable settlement of an antitrust suit in return for a promise of $400,000 in corporate support for the 1972 GOP convention.    The alleged quid pro quo was denied all round and never proved. But the ITT affair, and the Watergate scandal that followed, did embarrass Congress into putting restrictions on corporate funds for conventions and providing public money instead. Since then, Congress has increased the public financing sharply from the initial $2 million allocated to each party. But at the same time the Federal Election Commission has steadily loosened the curbs on corporate contributions.    Since 1975 the commission has allowed companies based in the convention city to contribute to local &quot;host committees&quot; raising funds to attract the event. Then the FEC allowed donations by national corporations with local outlets. This year, it gave General Motors permission to lend -- through local dealerships -- fleets of cars for party VIPs to use during each convention.    The election commission has also cleared corporate spending for hospitality suites and for parties for delegates, government officials and the press. On Saturday, for example, Ford Motor paid for a breakfast cruise aboard the riverboat Creole Queen, during which GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf and Bush strategist Lee Atwater briefed reporters.    Not to be outdone, GM was the host for an evening reception Sunday for Senate GOP Leader Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, both possible vice presidential candidates.    Increasingly, corporate funds also are going indirectly to finance campaigns, not just conventions. It has been illegal since 1907 for corporations to contribute directly to a candidate in a federal election. A party spokeswoman says corporate money raised at Thursday's gala won't go to the presidential candidate's campaign but, instead, will be used for certain GOP state and local election activities, which is allowed by election law. But that doesn't mean the national campaign doesn't ultimately benefit: State parties may spend the money on advertising and mailings to boost the entire Republican ticket.    So far, in this new era of campaign largess, business has been good. Democrats are raking in plenty of donations from wealthy companies and individuals and are talking about the once-unthinkable possibility of outspending the Republicans. That isn't going unnoticed at the GOP, notes Mr. Bush's chief fund-raiser, Fred Bush (no relation).    &quot;We should at least meet what they are going to do,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't care where it comes from.&quot;    (Revised WSJ Aug. 17, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
