My fear is that they'll run to time deposits at local commercial banks.&quot;    Most of the $204.7 billion in capital reserves held by the six member nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar -- are invested in Western Europe and in the U.S., according to a recent study by National Bank of Kuwait. The investments run from equities to real estate.    Some Arab officials have asserted that the drop in share prices on international markets may benefit the gulf region and help stem capital flight, which has especially hampered the regional economies since the start of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980.    Mohammed Abdullah, portfolio manager of the Abu Dhabi central bank, has said he expects local markets to benefit from the sharp declines in share prices in New York, London and Tokyo.    &quot;There has been an increasing trend for people in the United Arab Emirates to invest overseas, but now their confidence has been shaken and it will, in the long run, be in our favor,&quot; Mr. Abdullah was quoted by the government news agency as saying. &quot;There has been a continual outward flow of foreign currencies, but now people may see that local investments will be safer.&quot;    Amid the world-wide market turmoil last week, the Al-Shall index for the Kuwaiti market, the most developed stock market in the region, dropped by only 1.19 points to 40.70, 5% above the index's level at the end of 1986.    Bankers and portfolio managers cautioned that it is too early to judge the eventual impact of the crash on Arab investor behavior. Some maintained that Arab investors may be more inclined to ride out the market's current downturn if it's only short-lived. Moreover, any hopes for a boom in the gulf region are likely to be overshadowed by the continuing Iran-Iraq war.    Fahd Mohammed Al Rashid, general manager of the government-run Kuwait Investment Authority, conceded last week that the nation would be affected &quot;temporarily&quot; by the plunge in world-wide equity markets.&quot;    But &quot;Kuwait has pursued a long-term investment strategy which had already made provisions for these developments,&quot; Mr. Al Rashid was quoted as saying by the state news agency. &quot;It isn't built on quick reactions or short-term changes in world markets.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
