The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that theMinnesota controversy never should have landed in federal court.   The justices in 1986 let stand, again without comment, rulingsthat the Minnesota Ethics in Government Act does not violate thefree-speech or associational rights of NRA members.   The law requires lobbying groups to register with the state, anddisclose the names, addresses and places of employment of all thosewho contributed more than $50.   The Minnesota Ethical Practices Board, which enforces the law,said the NRA is a lobbying group because, in part, it spentthousands of dollars on mailings attacking former State AttorneyGeneral Warren Spannaus in his 1982 gubernatorial campaign.   Spannaus lost the Democratic primary to Rudy Perpich, who waslater elected governor.   U.S. District Judge Miles Lord upheld the law in a May 2, 1984,ruling. Subsequent NRA appeals to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals and the Supreme Court failed.   The association in late 1984 complied with the law _ supplyingthe board with the names, addresses and places of employment ofmore than 20,000 Minnesota members to whom letters had been sent inconnection with the 1982 elections.   Records show that $23,256 was spent in connection with themailings.   In its 1986 appeal, the NRA contended that no group should beheld accountable to government regulation because it communicateswith its members concerning candidates for state office.   But in the appeal acted on today, the NRA argued that Lordlacked the authority to rule in the case because the state agency'slawsuit was based on alleged state law violations.   The lawsuit had been filed in a state court but the NRA had thecase switched to federal court.   The case is NRA vs. Minnesota Ethical Practices Board, 88-300.</TEXT></DOC>
