The union struck the commuter aircraft maker when its previous three-year contract expired June 22. De Havilland, which requested today's meeting, declined to say whether it planned to make any new proposals.    About 750 union members at Boeing's Winnipeg, Manitoba, plant previously set Aug. 4 as their strike deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
