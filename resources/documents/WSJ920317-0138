Angrist</HL><DATE>03/17/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><LP>   It's the thing we all dread: The official U.S. governmentbrown envelope showing the return address of the DistrictDirector of the Internal Revenue Service. Opening it withtrembling hands, the taxpayer finds a notice saying he or shehas been selected for an audit.   In &quot;Battling the IRS&quot; (Scott Foresman, 271 pages, $16.95),David Silverman says the receipt of such a notice is notnecessarily a reason to look for an open window on a highfloor. He explains that dealing with the IRS requires thesame skills as dealing with any large bureaucracy:persistence and patience. And he provides some comfort bynoting that if you feel mystified by IRS forms, letters andrequests you are not alone. He quotes David Pryor, chairmanof the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Oversight of the IRS,who is fond of saying: &quot;As a United States senator, Iprobably know more about the inner workings of the KGB than Ido about the IRS.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   One of the most intriguing chapters in Mr. Silverman'sbook describes what happens when you can't pay the taxes youowe. The good news is that the IRS doesn't use debtors'prison. The bad news is that the agency has a number of othertechniques that might influence you to cough up. Theseinclude the authority to garnish your wages, file liens onthings you own and seize your bank accounts.   But wait, there is more good news] &quot;Contrary to popularbelief that every citizen is entitled to their day in court,the IRS doesn't have to prove in a court of law that you oweadditional tax, penalties and interest before they cancommence collection action. They only have to make anassessment of tax and a demand for payment,&quot; writes Mr.Silverman. You do have certain rights in dealing with the IRSbut you must exercise them. &quot;Silence constitutes a waiver ofthose rights,&quot; he notes ominously.   The IRS loves to send out notices. Each year it mails outgood news in the form of 26.6 million penalty notices, 3.5million notices informing taxpayers they didn't report alltheir income, 3 million notices to taxpayers stating theyfailed to file a tax return and tens of millions of notices-- the exact number is not knowable -- stating that taxpayersfailed to pay what they owed or made a mistake in preparingtheir tax return. Even better is the news that in 1988 theGeneral Accounting Office determined that 37% of the IRS'sreplies to taxpayers' inquiries were either incorrect orirrelevant to the issues raised by the taxpayer. (More recentnumbers are not available.)   Fortunately, Mr. Silverman's book provides suggestedreplies to nearly every type of communication the IRSdispatches. It also tells you when you should seekprofessional assistance and when you can take the agency onalone.   The late Fred Allen struck a just-right optimistic noteabout the IRS when he said, &quot;Thank God they're not doingbrain surgery.&quot;   ---   &quot;To make the election, write `lump-sum distribution' online 8d, column (a). Enter in column (g) 25% (.25) of theamount from Form 1099-R, Box 3. Enter the remaining amount ofthe distribution (Form 1099-R, Box 2, minus the amount usedon Schedule D) on Form 1040, lines 17a and 17b.&quot; That comesdirectly from the instructions for completing Schedule D inyour 1040 instruction booklet.   It should also be a good reason for you to buy an incometax guidebook if you do your own tax return. Even if youdon't, the book provides a source of ideas and checks on howgood a job your tax preparer did in completing your return.The best of these guides is again &quot;Guide to Income TaxPreparation&quot; (Consumer Reports Books, 628 pages, $13.95). Itdetails in plain English the latest changes in the tax laws,including an increased tax burden for higher incometaxpayers, the total nondeductibility of interest on consumerloans and the new filing requirements for homeofficedeductions.   Home-office workers will love the new form for calculatingtheir business expenses. Form 8829 has several interestingcalculations on it, sure to challenge the most jaded ofdo-it-yourself filers. For instance, it has a proportioncalculation to let you figure out what fraction of yourexpenses is deductible for the office you have in your house.   ---   Taxpayers who bought, refinanced or, more importantly,sold a home in 1991 might want to consider Julian Block'sbook &quot;The Home Owner's Tax Guide&quot; (Runzheimer International,173 pages, $14.95; available from Runzheimer at1-800-942-9949). It follows the ins and outs of the tax lawsas applied to home ownership.   Many people in 1991 refinanced their mortgages to takeadvantage of the lower interest rates now prevailing on homemortgages. In the process of refinancing they frequently hadto pay &quot;points,&quot; a percentage of the amount borrowed underthe new mortgage. Mr. Block explains in detail the rules thatgovern how and to what extent points are deductible.   ---   In a review on retirement books I mentioned that JaneBryant Quinn's book &quot;Making the Most of Your Money&quot; includesa set of forms that would be useful to retirees and potentialretirees in estimating retirement income. Those forms weredeveloped by T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, and areavailable in kit form, without charge, from the company bycalling 1-800-541-0295. The company also has software thatwill take you through the same planning and analysis. It runson IBM and compatibles and is available from T. Rowe Pricefor $15 by calling 1-800-541-4041.</TEXT></DOC>
