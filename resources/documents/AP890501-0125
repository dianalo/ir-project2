It would be ``the first time that industry, labor and governmenthave joined together to put together a plan to combat drugsmuggling,'' Customs Commissioner William von Raab said beforemeeting with representatives of about 100 air and sea carrierswhere the plan was outlined.   Von Raab estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine coming intothe country is entering in containers. He said he expected that toreach 50 percent in the next two years and up to 80 percent to 90percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on other forms oftrafficking.   The plan seeks to ``prevent drugs from being put on board'' atforeign ports, said Lou Razzino, the agency's program manager fornarcotics interdiction in commercial cargo. ``Prevent is the keyword. Up until now, we've been talking interdiction,'' he added.   At the meeting, a longshoremen's union leader said union membersmight refuse to unload any cargo from drug-producing countries ifthey don't curtail the illegal trafficking.   John Bowers, president of the International Longshoreman'sAssociation, said some foreign countries don't even care ``whetherdrugs are going on these ships.''   He added that his members are ``saying that if they think theycan use those ships as the dumping grounds in the United States fortheir drugs, then we're going to put on a boycott. ... We know we'dlose wages. We'd rather lose wages than lose our children.''   He declined to say what criteria the union would use to refuseto unload ships. He noted that longshoremen had refused for 25years to unload cargo from the Soviet Union and recently paid $9million in fines because the union lost a Supreme Court decisionover the boycott.   The proposal outlined Monday calls for industries to imposestrict security standards at foreign and domestic terminals andfacilities and aboard their carriers. Customs would providesecurity training, surveys of foreign and domestic sites and helpin identifying potential smuggling opportunities.   Compliance with the voluntary agreement will be considered inassessing penalties or seizing a vehicle found to have illegaldrugs after the pact is signed.   The cost to each carrier has not been determined.   Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, penalties for carryingillegal drugs went up to $1,000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and$500 per ounce of marijuana. The law also authorized seizure of thecarrier.   Some carriers' representatives wanted a tariff imposed thatwould cover their costs for new security measures the agreementwould demand, so they would remain competitive with carriers thatdon't participate. Razzino said, however, that such a decisionwould be up to Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
