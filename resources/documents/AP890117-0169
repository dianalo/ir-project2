Jan Bodanyi, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said the purchases beganin early 1988 and so far have involved buying from internationalarms dealers or private citizens Soviet MiG-15, 17 and 21 jetfighters.   The Defense Department also has bought Soviet air-defenseequipment such as radar systems with a view toward better trainingAmerican pilots, she added.   The U.S. military has long conducted tests and experiments withmilitary equipment made in the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact and ThirdWorld countries and later captured, stolen or covertly purchased.   The Pentagon had not acknowledged previously, however, thatefforts are now made to buy Soviet weaponry in an open manner in theworld's arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret.   Last September, the Pentagon announced the creation of a neworganization known as the Mobile Operational Test Force, set up bythe Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation Office, that receivesthe Soviet equipment being purchased. Reporters were later allowedto watch the new organization test some Soviet-bloc equipment atKirtland Air Force Base, N.M.   Reporters were not told then, however, that much of the equipmentthey were viewing _ including the MiG jet fighters _ had beenpurchased through arms dealers and other ``non-covert'' sources.   That acknowledgement came Tuesday only when the Pentagonresponded to a report by the trade publication ``Inside thePentagon,'' focusing on one aspect of the testing program.   ``The Defense Department is purchasing Soviet and other `threat'aircraft from commercial sources,'' said Bodanyi. ``It is acontinuing effort.''   The spokeswoman acknowledged the Pentagon does not expect to findthe newest and most modern Soviet weapons for sale on the openmarket. But she said that ``purchasing Soviet aircraft fromcommercial sources is often three to four times cheaper thanmodifying U.S. aircraft to Soviet characteristics.''   ``In addition, openly acquired aircraft and equipment can betested openly by average U.S. servicemen, which adds to operationaltesting realism,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
