(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's only a student body vote, but stateofficials will be watching closely this week when StanfordUniversity holds the first election by computer in California.   If voter turnout is as big as organizers hope, the electionTuesday and Wednesday could be the largest in the United Statesever conducted on computers and a harbinger of general elections inthe 21st century.   The Stanford computers will be programmed with a variety ofsafeguards to discourage hackers and vote fraud. If the voter triessomething funny with the keyboard, for example, the computer willmake noise to summon a poll watcher.   ``We're observing the Stanford election as an interestingexperiment,'' said John Mott-Smith, coordinator of voter outreachprograms for the California secretary of state's office.``Computers are becoming increasingly useful in a variety of ways.One of those ways could be elections.''   An election last week at Boston University drew 3,159 voters,believed to be the largest turnout at a computer election so far inthe United States. Stanford's enrollment of 13,000 is smaller thanBU's, but a typical Stanford election draws about 5,000 voters,organizers said.   ``It was very simple, a lot easier than the old system,'' saidBU senior Colin Dodd, who used a Macintosh ``mouse,'' a hand-helddevice that transmits instructions to the computer, to make hischoices instead of a pen or pencil.   Though though system at Boston got generally good reviews, adisk failure caused 248 votes last week to go uncounted. A computerscientist is checking to see whether the missing votes can beretrieved, but they weren't enough to have affected the outcome ofany of the races there anyway.   Although California has no plans to hold computerized elections,officials are intrigued by Stanford's experiment and hope to seehow secure and ``user-friendly'' the system proves to be. Theelection is expected to cost at least $3,000 less than the $13,000spent last year, and allow votes to be counted within two hoursinstead of five days.   ``It's interesting for us to see how the bright minds ofStanford University, in conjunction with Silicon Valley, are goingto deal with the questions of how voters interact with theequipment,'' Mott-Smith said.   omputers aren't completely unknown on Election Day, of course.In many locations, voters use a stylus to punch holes in cards thatare then counted by computers, like the keypunch cards that were astaple of computer departments until the last decade or so.   But with that kind of voting system, or the old-fashioned paperballots, the paper remains as a backup if there is a problem or acall for a recount.   ``How a computer can duplicate that integrity is an interestingquestion,'' Mott-Smith said. ``The bottom line is the people haveto have confidence that the system is accurate.''   Stanford student election officials think they've got afraud-proof system that's easy to use and should take each voteronly about three minutes. The software was developed by a student,sophomore Sandy Aronson.   ``If the computer detects that it's being tampered with in somemanner, it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the pollwatcher,'' said elections commissioner Steven Krauss, also asophomore.   But paper ballots will still be used by students at Stanford'sthree overseas campuses, for absentee ballots and for those whorefuse to use the Macintosh computers.   ``There will probably always be people on campus who don't knowhow to use a `Mac' and are dreadfully afraid of using themachine,'' Krauss said. ``For those who fall into that category _who would like to vote but there's no way on God's green earththey're going to touch one of these machines _ we will have paperand pencils available.''</TEXT></DOC>
