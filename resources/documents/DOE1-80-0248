<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0248 </DOCNO><TEXT>The reaction /sup 35/Cl(d,p)/sup 36/Cl was studied at deuteron energy12.3 MeV using a multi-angle magnetic spectrograph with resolving powerE/{Delta}E {approx_equal} 2000. Precise excitation energies of 77 statesin /sup 36/Cl up to 7 MeV are presented. The level energies of some stateswere measured with a precision of 70-80 eV; several new states were found.Angular distributions of proton groups corresponding of 51 states in/sup 36/Cl were analysed using DWBA calculations. Transferred orbitalangular momenta and absolute values of spectroscopic factors were deduced.Spectroscopic factors for 36 states are given for the first time. Thesubstantial parts of single-particle strengths for 1f and 2p orbits areexhausted by the observed l=3 and l=1 transitions. Spectroscopic strengthsfor the positive-parity states show that 2s and 1d orbits in the groundstate of /sup 35/Cl are much more empty than should follow from simple-shell-modelor from calculations made in the full space of sd-shell-model wave functionsby Wildenthal et al.</TEXT></DOC>
