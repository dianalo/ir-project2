The system, to be announced with fanfare today at theHayden Planetarium in New York, would cost $2.1 billion tofully put in space as early as 1996. &quot;We think this is theway of the future,&quot; said John F. Mitchell, Motorola's vicechairman.</LP><TEXT>   But the 77-satellite system -- which the company hasdubbed &quot;Iridium&quot; -- faces big obstacles. Among other things,the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and semiconductor companyneeds partners, money, regulatory approval and customers tomake it work.   The way Motorola sees it, a call from a portable cellularphone in the middle of nowhere -- beyond the range of currentcellular systems -- would be routed through the&quot;constellation&quot; of small satellites. That would give thebusiness person in the boondocks and the skipper at seainstant, clear contact with anyone else -- and vice versa.   The Iridium system would use digital switching andtransmission to handle both voices and data. But it wouldn'treplace the current land-based cellular system. That meansMotorola could continue to sell existing equipment even as itpushes expensive new equipment necessary to make calls on thenew system.   A big risk is that consumers will get confused. Craig O.McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., thenation's largest cellular phone service company, noted thatcellular is growing and changing faster than anyone dreamedjust a few years ago. &quot;All of us have a lot of work to do tosee how all these {different networks} are going to fittogether.&quot;   Still, Mr. McCaw said his company is &quot;excited&quot; at thepotential of the new system to provide universal phonecoverage.   Others think Motorola's new system is closer topie-in-the-sky than satellites-in-the-sky. &quot;This may havesome applications for {airline} flight communicationsservices and in countries where there is limited service, butthere's no way I can see this technology will be viableanywhere in the U.S.,&quot; said Herschel Shosteck, president ofHerschel Shosteck Associates Ltd., a Silver Spring, Md., firmthat specializes in cellular market analysis.   He noted that by 1992 -- before Iridium is expected totransmit its first call -- more than 90% of the people in theU.S. and Canada will have access to regular cellular service.This will be augmented by the first high-capacity digitalsystems. And most of Western Europe will have similarcoverage.   Motorola expects the mobile and portable terminals that itwould make for the system to cost &quot;as low as&quot; $3,000. ThoughMotorola expects the price to fall over time, Mr. Shostecknotes that today's cellular phones are far cheaper at $400 to$500.   Motorola also must get other companies or countries toparticipate in a consortium to operate and pay for the $2.1billion space portion of the system. Motorola might put up asmuch as 20% of that total, but John Pemberton, a mobilecommunications analyst at Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.,says the cost is far higher than he expected.   In addition, operators of the new network face thedaunting task of getting new licenses from the FederalCommunications Commission and other international bodies tooperate a satellite network in the new frequency.   And since current cellular systems operate at a differentfrequency, existing phones &quot;would have to be programmed tooperate with the new frequency,&quot; said Gregory J. Vogt, chiefof the FCC's Mobile Services Bureau. &quot;That could be a veryexpensive proposition&quot; for customers, he said. Motorolabrushed aside such concern, saying it would design its systemto be compatible with all cellular phones.   Still, Motorola's plan isn't being taken lightly. &quot;They'rea well-established company&quot; both in working with regulatorsand coming up with money, said Mr. Pemberton of the GartnerGroup. He says there's an 85% chance that the system willfly.   In contrast to larger communications satellites now inhigh orbit, the Motorola plan calls for small, low-orbitsatellites that would allow easy radio links with portablecellular phones and clear sound with no delays or &quot;echoes.&quot;It envisions 600,000 to 800,000 users in the first fiveyears, and millions more after that.   The company says it's investing $40 million to $60 millionto help prove the concept. But it sees itself mainly as asupplier to the system. Motorola's ambitious schedule callsfor the launch of two demonstration satellites in 1992.   Motorola said the U.S. Delta and Atlas rockets and theEuropean Ariane could launch multiple satellites, and thePegasus air-launched vehicle could send up individualsatellites.   The company said three organizations have agreed to studythe potential of the satellite network: American MobileSatellite Corp., which is licensed to provide mobilecommunications by satellite for the U.S. (and in which McCawCellular is a partner); and Telesat Mobile Inc., which hassimilar authorization for Canada; and the InternationalMaritime Satellite Organization, a consortium that providessatellite communications for ships and aircraft. The maritimegroup's director general, Olof Lundberg, said it will studythe system as a possible successor to its existing satellitenetwork.   Motorola also said it has briefed the FCC on its plans andtalked with potential partners. &quot;The technical effort isgoing on full bore,&quot; said Mr. Mitchell. &quot;By the end of thisyear, or early next year, we'll have a much clearer pictureof who the players will be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
