Chiron said the joint venture, Biocine Co., will conduct the tests in Geneva. The studies are expected to last from six months to a year, and will overlap with tests planned to begin in the U.S. within the year, Chiron said.    A spokeswoman said between 20 and 30 healthy males, between the ages of 20 and 60, will be involved in the trial. The object is to verify product safety and to see how the prospective vaccine behaves in humans, the company said.    Biocine was formed in April 1987 as an equally owned joint venture of Chiron, a biotechnology concern, and Ciba-Geigy, Ardsley, N.Y., a unit of Ciba-Geigy AG, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer. </TEXT></DOC>
