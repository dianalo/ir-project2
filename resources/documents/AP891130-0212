Rosalind Wells, the chief economist for the National RetailMerchants Association, also said Wednesday that continueddiscounting is likely as merchants try to draw customers who mightotherwise take advantage of an extra pre-Christmas weekend and waituntil the last minute to shop.   She said feedback from stores around the country showed a patchypattern of sales in the days immediately after Thanksgiving _ whenshoppers traditionally launch their annual buying binge.   ``My feeling is that it was a pretty good start to the seasonbut nothing exceptional,'' Ms. Wells said.   Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Ms. Wells saidthat after talking with retailers about business last Fridaythrough Sunday ``My sense ... is that there was overall somedisappointment.''   The nation's major retailers will provide an early reading onthe holidays when they release monthly sales figures on Thursday.Most of the big chain stores will report their results for the fourweeks ended Nov. 25.   Like other analysts, Ms. Wells expects a mediocre Christmas forthe retail industry. She has predicted holiday sales will rise 5.5percent this year over last year, when the sales gain was 9 percentover 1987.   ``I think the preliminary results we're getting are consistentwith our forecast,'' she said.   Continuing an almost year-long trend, clothing is moving thefastest, paced by sales of womens apparel, Ms. Wells said. Mens andchildrens wear sales are less robust. There also is continuedweakness in sales of home-related merchandise, such as furniture,floor coverings, curtains and appliances.   Markdowns by stores strapped for cash and by their competitorsare giving sales a boost, especially in the Northeast, Ms. Wellssaid. A cold snap in the Northeast and elsewhere also isencouraging shoppers to buy winter goods.   She said special holiday promotions are pervasive andparticularly intense in areas that have stores owned by financiallytroubled Campeau Corp., whose properties include Bloomingdale's,Jordan Marsh, The Bon and Rich's-Goldsmiths.   Another highly leveraged retailer, R.H. Macy andamp; Co., isresponding with aggressive promotions of its own.   In addition to the East Coast, sales promotions seem to behaving a major impact in Atlanta, Boston, Indianapolis and severalother areas.   Business between Thanksgiving and Christmas generates as much ashalf of a retailer's annual income.   In the retailers' favor, the holiday shopping season is longerthis year than last year by 1 day, spanning a total of 31 days. In1987, the peak spending season was 28 days.   But Ms. Wells said there is a drawback to this year's calendar.   Many shoppers, knowing they have a final weekend for gifthunting, might put off buying until the last minute. By that time,retailers would be anxious for business and might offer even biggermarkdowns to attract customers, which would cut into their profits.   ``I think there's a high probability that that's going to be thecase,'' Ms. Wells said.</TEXT></DOC>
