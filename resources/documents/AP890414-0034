It has not beenlater since the Tax Foundation began calculating this measure ofthe burden imposed on workers by federal, state and localgovernments. It was Feb. 13 in 1930.   By the foundation's calculations, the average worker will work124 days this year just to pay taxes. So, if the governmentdemanded its money up front, it would take all of the averageworker's income through May 4.   That is the same as the last two years _ in fact, it is the sameas in 1981, when Congress and President Reagan agreed on thebiggest tax cut in the nation's history.   ``Americans ... are not better off than they were in 1981,despite economic growth, cuts in income tax rates and repeatedclaims that government spending has been cut to the bone,'' thefoundation said Thursday in announcing Tax Freedom Day.   The reasons: 13 federal tax increases enacted since 1981; thegiant 1986 tax overhaul, which, to millions of taxpayers, took awaymore than it gave; Social Security taxes that have been growingmore rapidly than the economy, and steady state and local taxincreases caused in part by a reduction in federal aid.   If you prefer worrying about your taxes on the installment plan,the foundation offers this option: The average worker will put in 1hour and 46 minutes each 8-hour day this year to pay federal taxesand another 56 minutes for state and local taxes. The federal takeis down by a minute from 1988; the state-local burden is unchanged.   The foundation, a Washington-based research organization,assumes for the purposes of its calculation that all taxes are paidby individuals, including those collected from corporations.   As the foundation offered its unique look at the tax system,there were these developments:   _The Internal Revenue Service geared up for the last three workdays of the 1988 return-filing season, promising its toll-freetelephone system will be open to answer questions Saturday morningand until 7 p.m. local time Monday. IRS offices offering advice towalk-in taxpayers plan extended hours on Monday.   The IRS earlier projected that 32 million couples andindividuals (out of 109 million expected to file sometime thisyear) would wait until the final two weeks of the season.   The deadline this year is Monday midnight because the statutorydeadline, April 15, falls on a Saturday. Because Monday is aholiday, Patriots' Day, in Massachusetts, where one of the IRS's 10service centers is located, filers in New England and most of NewYork state have until midnight Tuesday.   _Groups opposed to current levels of military spending preparedto demonstrate in more than 50 cities in a protest dubbed ``BuildHomes Not Bombs Tax Day Actions.'' The actions range from urginglate filers at the Post Office in Milwaukee to attach proteststamps to IRS envelopes, to construction of a cardboard ``taxshelter'' in Santa Rosa, Calif.   _The Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, composed of specialinterests fighting any rise in excise taxes to fight the federaldeficit, released a study indicating that over the past 10 yearsthe share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risen by 12percent while the burden on upper-income Americans has dropped by4.3 percent. The group says this would be worsened by higher taxeson gasoline, alcohol or tobacco.   The 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income _between $20,000 and $60,000 _ saw a 3.4 percent rise in their shareof the burden. Those with incomes under $20,000 constituteabout-one-third of the population; those over $60,000, aboutone-sixth.</TEXT></DOC>
