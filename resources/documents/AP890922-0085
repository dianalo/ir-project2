Up to 450 Khmer Rouge guerrillas based in Thailand and aiming tocarve out a ``liberated zone'' have intensified mortar shelling ofPailin, sometimes raining 2,000 rounds a day on the area, accordingto the deputy defense minister, Gen. Ke Kim Yan.   A confrontation between government forces and guerrillas in themountainous area that includes Pailin will test whether theCambodian army can defend the country without help from Vietnam.   ``We will not let the enemy occupy any territory as a liberatedzone,'' he told reporters. On Thursday, Vietnam began what it calledthe pullout of its last 26,000 troops.   ``We are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose Pailin,'' hesaid.   Thousands more soldiers began moving out today after a ceremonyin Battambang, a neighboring province boredering Thailand thatincludes Pailin.   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese, who invaded the country in 1978 andtoppled the notorious Khmer Rouge regime, have promised to withdrawthe last of their troops by Tuesday and leave the pro-Hanoigovernment of President Heng Samrin to fend for itself.   Cambodia's army of an estimated 50,000 regulars and 60,000 to80,000 poorly trained militia members will then face a resistancecoalition of roughly 50,000 guerrillas.   ``We still stay in Pailin; that means the Khmer Rouge cannot doanything to Cambodia,'' Ke Kim Yan said.   A Foreign Ministry official said Friday that Pailin town wasshelled when he and a foreign journalist visited there a few daysago. On the road, shells also struck a few feet behind an armoredpersonnel carrier in their convoy, he said on condition of anonymity.   The Vietnamese troops are to cross into southern Vietnam onTuesday by air, land, sea and river, ending Vietnam's involvement ina war that cost it the lives of more than 25,000 soldiers,international isolation and economic stagnation.   The three guerrilla groups trying to topple the governmentVietnam installed in Phnom Penh say they do not believe Vietnamintends to withdraw its troops. Still, they have been launching newattacks in areas bordering Thailand to take advantage of it, saidmany officials.   Many Western analysts say Phnom Penh's army could have problemsfighting the guerrillas alone. The Khmer Rouge, the largestguerrilla group, has decades of battle experience.   However, Ke Kim Yan said: ``The Vietnamese army ... helped theCambodian army very much in gaining experience. We are nowexperienced enough to deal with guerrilla warfare.''   The general said the Khmer Rouge began attacking the Pailin areain July from two bases in Thailand's border province of Trat.   ``If you capture Pailin, you gain not only in military buteconomic strategy,'' Ke Kim Yan said.   ``It would be easy for them to get their military supplies infrom bases in Trat province. It is a mountainous and forested areaso you can hide your men there. And there are rubies so you can getmoney to feed all your men,'' he said.   The general said his forces have suffered few casualties atPailin except for some troops who stepped on the increasing numberof guerrilla-planted land mines   Fighting in other parts of Cambodia currently is limited tosmall-scale, hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, he said.   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, who took power in 1975, tried toforce an agrarian revolution on the country. During that time,hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died fromexecutions, famine and civil unrest.   The other members of the resistance coalition are thenon-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front of formerCambodian Prime Minister Son Sann and followers of former Cambodianhead of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   In a statement issued in Beijing on Thursday and seen in Bangkoktoday, Sihanouk denounced as a sham Vietnam's pledged withdrawal.   Sihanouk also rejected a recent Thai cease-fire proposal for hiscountry and flatly refused to enter talks with Phnom Penh.   However, a Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman, PrachyadaviTavedikul, said his country and other Southeast Asian nations stillwill campaign for the Cambodian resistance coalition to retain itsseat in the United Nations as the official Cambodian government.   The issue is expected to come up when the U.N. General Assemblyconvenes in New York this month. Some dipolomats expect reducedsupport for the coalition because of Vietnam's promised pullout.</TEXT></DOC>
