(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Navstar navigation satelliterocketed into orbit Saturday to join a network of spacecraft thatguide bombers, warships, missiles and ground troops with pinpointaccuracy.   An Air Force Delta 2 rocket propelled the $65 million satelliteinto an orbit ranging out to 11,000 miles high following a fieryliftoff that brilliantly illuminated the pre-dawn sky.   ``The satellite has been picked up; we sent commands and it'sresponding as expected,'' said Air Force Col. Marty Runkle, themission director. It appeared to be a normal mission, he said.   Information on rocket performance was delayed nearly an hourbecause a tracking station on Ascension Island in the southAtlantic also was supporting the space shuttle Atlantis at thetime. Trackers there recorded the rocket data and later played itback to the launch control center here.   The Navstar is the fourth in a new series of spacecraft thatenable U.S. and allied military units such as planes, ships,submarines, tanks and field troops to precisely determine theirpositions to within 50 feet in any type of weather anywhere in theworld.   They tune in on the network's radio signals, using receivers assmall as a hand-held telephone.   The satellites also keep track of the speed of military unitswithin a fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within amillionth of a second.</TEXT></DOC>
