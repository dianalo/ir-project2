Dealers said the U.S. unit had expended its energy in thedays leading up to the release of the trade data, advancingon expectations that the trade deficit would narrowsubstantially. But when the expected improvement was finallyreported, the market tried to lift the dollar and was metalmost instantly by selling.</LP><TEXT>   It was obvious that the market was long on dollars beforethe trade figures were released, said Douglas Madison,corporate trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles. A briefeffort to take the dollar higher right after release of thefigures was countered by a large number of orders to sell, hesaid. &quot;It was just a wall that the interbank market in no waycould break through,&quot; he added.   The Commerce Department reported that the nation'smerchandise trade deficit narrowed to $6.49 billion inFebruary from a revised gap of $9.32 billion in January. Theresult was the best recorded since December 1983. Economistshad forecast a February deficit of $7.6 billion, althoughsome currency dealers had been talking about deficits asnarrow as $4.5 billion to $5 billion in recent days.   One minute after the release of the data, the dollar hitits intraday high of 1.6830 marks and 1.4940 Swiss francs.But the U.S. currency put up little defense of such heights.A few minutes later, the dollar had turned sharply loweragainst the West German and Swiss currencies as well asagainst the yen.   Hubert Pedroli, vice president and manager of foreignexchange at Credit Suisse in New York, said a trader at hisfirm was selling the dollar to one customer for 1.6830 marksalmost as he was buying it from another for 1.6770 marks. Thewhole thing lasted 10 seconds, he said.   Against the yen, dealers didn't even try to push the U.S.currency higher, he said. The dollar never went up againstits Japanese counterpart because 160.00 yen had previouslyproved a solid ceiling, he said. People bought the dollarahead of the trade number, he said. Once the news was out,&quot;it just couldn't go higher.&quot;   The dollar was trading at 159.60 yen just before therelease of the trade data.   Charles Spence, vice president of foreign exchange atFirst Interstate of California in Los Angeles, said dealersquickly noted that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan hadwidened for the month despite the overall narrowing. As aresult, the first analysis led to a sell-off of the dollaragainst the yen, he said.   U.S. imports from Japan exceeded exports to that countryby $3.12 billion for the month, swelling from $2.86 billionin January.   Bank of America's Mr. Madison said the worsening U.S.trade performance with Japan will strengthen the position ofthose who argue that the U.S. should take part in some effort-- like intervention -- to bring the dollar lower against theyen.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6722 marks, down from 1.6768 marks late Tuesday, and at158.10 yen, down from 159.68 yen late Tuesday. Sterling wasquoted at $1.6392, up from $1.6385 Tuesday.   In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at158.35 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 159.87 yen.Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6735 marks.   The Treasury Department said in a report to Congressyesterday that the depreciation of the yen is a matter ofconcern and that the Group of Seven industrialized nationswill keep developments under review. However, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady told Congress earlier that therecent decline of the yen is of no immediate concern and thatthe Japanese unit has been relatively stable over the pasttwo to three years.   The Brady statement came late in the trading day and hadno impact on rates. The report was released following theclose of trading.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $376.10 an ounce, up 90 cents. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $376.70 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
