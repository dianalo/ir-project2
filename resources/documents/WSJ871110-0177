President Reagan must resist the momentum for irresponsible tax increases and protectionist legislation or the analogy with the 1930s will become reality.    Interestingly, the stock-market panic has presented Mr. Reagan with a golden opportunity to bargain for the line-item veto. A simple tax increase would probably be damaging to the economy, but a $50 billion tax increase would be a small price to pay for the power of future presidents to cut fat and waste out of budgets on a line-by-line basis. If the Democrats balk, Mr. Reagan could use the current glare of publicity to expose their insincerity on deficit reduction. The stock-market crash punted the ball to Mr. Reagan. Now he can run with it.    Stephen Blinn   Berkeley, Calif.   ---   Our budget deficits are much to blame for the stock-market crash, but it doesn't follow that we should immediately trim the deficits. Though this would help stay a price and interest-rate jump, it could also help spur a recession. Whether the deficits are brought down by higher taxes that reduce private spending or by lower appropriations that reduce government spending, the same effect would be had on the U.S. economy. The lessened spending would leave the economy, after five long buoyant years, ripe for reversal and recession. Deficit cuts are proper when the economy can stand some reining in without worry about its caving in. The stock market is apt to understand this, and to react less favorably, not more favorably, to deficit cuts this fiscal year. They should be pledged now, but not take effect until next fiscal year.    Saul R. Srole   Silver Spring, Md.   ---   A positive step to indicate congressional seriousness relative to deficit reduction would be the repeal of the $20 billion &quot;pork barrel&quot; water bill. This bill at this time is absolutely ridiculous and would make a comical paradox if it wasn't so alarming and threatening to our national economy.    Fred P.
