The separator was calibratedfrom first principles so that it was also used to measure magnetic susceptibilityof the isolates. Using this method MagnetoGraphs have been prepared forseveral Pennsylvania coals which correlate ash and sulfur with magneticsusceptibility. The MagnetoGraph of Lower Kittanning seam coal from ClearfieldCounty, PA, is compared with results achieved by dry open gradient magneticseparation and commercial wet cleaning by Deister Tables and froth flotation.</TEXT></DOC>
