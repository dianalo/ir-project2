Despite the setbacks, many U.S. analysts do not believe thatIran is in danger of defeat at the hands of Iraq.   But they are divided over why Iran risked battle with theworld's mightiest navy, and why the United States apparently soughtconfrontation with Iran after a months-long lull in the land andtanker wars in gulf.   The naval battle in the Persian Gulf on Monday dealt a heavyblow to any possible improvement in relations between Iran and theUnited States, and it suggests that the Reagan administration mayhave badly miscalculated the Iranian reaction to what U.S.officials called a ``measured, appropriate response'' to a miningattack on an American warship last week.   President Reagan, defending the U.S. military action, saidTuesday that ``we ... consider the matter closed.''   Many analysts in and out of government believed it unlikely thatIran would let the issue die, and predicted more terrorist attacksin the gulf and elsewhere.   Given the renewed antagonism between Washington and Tehran, itappeared unlikely that Moscow would ease its objections to a UnitedNations embargo on arms sales to Iran and Iraq, a U.S. initiativedesigned to broaden international efforts to stop the fighting.   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, warned that ``we've got to make sure thatwe do not turn this into a U.S.-Iranian war,'' a situation the U.N.embargo was designed to counter.   In the Iranian view, said Georgetown University professorAnthony Cordesman, ``the United States seems to be the real forcethat is driving them from victory'' in the Iran-Iraq war.   The Iranian decision to engage U.S. forces may have beencalculated to inflict heavy casualties on the Americans and therebyinduce Congress to invoke the War Powers Act, possibly forcing thewithdrawal of American ships from the Persian Gulf.   Navy officers said that although Iran's navy is small, it hasmodern weapons that could sink an unwary or unlucky U.S. ship.   Heavy U.S. casualties, said Cordesman, could have provoked loudcries on Capitol Hill for the War Powers Act, passed after theVietnam War to give Congress 60, or at most 90, days to votewhether to leave U.S. forces in a war zone.   In ordering retaliatory strikes against two Iranian oilplatforms, U.S. war planners misjudged the mood in Iran, said JamesBill, author of a new book on U.S.-Iranian relations, ``The Eagleand the Lion.''   ``We are dealing with a country that is desperate andcornered,'' said Bill.   A year ago, administration analysts worried that Iraq could losethe war, opening the way to Iranian domination of the Arab statesbordering the gulf.   Last July, U.S. naval vessels began to escort reflagged Kuwaititankers in and out of the gulf in what administration officialsdescribed as an effort to protect international shipping.   Many analysts outside the administration viewed the reflaggingas an effort to bolster Iraq, and in Iran's view that has been theeffect, as Iraq has enjoyed subsequent military successes and Iranhas suffered setbacks.   The regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini failed to mount itsannual Kerbala offensive on the southern front with Iraq thiswinter, and there have been numerous reports of problems inrecruiting ``martyrs'' for the war.   Iran has been on the losing end of an exchange of missiles, the``war of the cities,'' that has inflicted limited damage on theIraqi capital of Baghdad but reportedly terrorized the Iraniancapital of Tehran and holy city of Qom.   Iran was somewhat successful on the northern front, taking sometowns in Kurdistan, but was shocked by an alleged Iraqi chemicalattack in that region this winter.   Iranian media have reported that U.S. helicopters were flyingair support for Iraqi ground forces involved in retaking the FawPeninsula, allegations that were denied by U.S. officials.   ``The Iranians think that the Faw and the U.S. naval attackswere worked out in advance,'' said Bill, a specialist in Iranianaffairs and professor at William and Mary College in Williamsburg,Va.   ``Strategically, this is going to set back U.S.-Iranianrelations for 30 to 40 years,'' said Bill. ``We need to take along-range, strategic view, not a short-range tactical view.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Bryan Brumley was an Associated Presscorrespondent in Tehran in 1979 and 1980, and now writes onnational security affairs from Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
