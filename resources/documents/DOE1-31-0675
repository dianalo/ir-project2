From the PRA for internal event, the average value of thisfrequency was found 2.5x10/sup -3/ event/year. Using the average firefrequency the resulting fire induced Core Melt frequency is 1.4x10/sup-8/ event/year. Although high separation of safety systems is requiredin Italian PWR plants, the frequency of fire induced Core Melt can reachvalues not negligible with respect to Italian safety standards. For thisreason, fire PRA studies for the entire plant are considered necessaryand should be performed with appropriate modifications of the methodsused for the American plants in order to be able to estimate lower fireinduced Core Melt frequencies.</TEXT></DOC>
