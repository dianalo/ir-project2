Switching Tactics With Businessland Deal</HEAD><BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steve Jobs' Next Inc., in an abrupt switchin marketing tactics, next week will announce plans to sell its``scholar's workstation'' through the nation's top retailer ofdesktop computers to business, industry sources said Thursday.   Next's deal with Businessland Inc., which has 112 outletsnationwide, would give Jobs' Palo Alto-based company greatervisibility, speed up development of software for its workstationsand deal a blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., analysts said.   Jobs, who called a news conference for March 30 to make ``a majorbusiness announcement,'' said last fall Next would initially sellits workstations exclusively to educators and students at adiscounted price of $6,500 and would not venture immediately intothe business market.   ``That was always a smokescreen,'' said Bruce Lupatkin, analystfor Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. in San Francisco. ``Anybody who is awakewould realize you couldn't build a big business in workstations andavoid selling to the corporate and technical market.''   The worldwide market for general purpose and technicalworkstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range from about$8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion and isgrowing rapidly. The retail price of the Next Computer System,according to industry sources, will range from $10,000 to $12,000.   Next's workstation, a sleek, black magnesium-boxed computer,which features a magneto-optical disk drive that can hold about200,000 typewritten pages of information, is Jobs' first productsince his ouster as chairman of Apple Computer Inc. in 1985.   Sun Microsystems, headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., is theleading maker of Unix workstations for engineers and technical usersand has been negotiating with Businessland and other resellers.   ``Sun is out in the cold as far as Businessland is concerned,''Lupatkin said. ``This is a step in the right direction for Next, butI don't think it means they have arrived and will replace theleaders.''   Businessland, which declined comment on the deal, also isexpected to announce it will carry new versions of IBM's RT PCtechnical workstations that can use Next's software.   ``Every workstation manufacturer is jockeying for marketposition,'' Jobs said in a letter announcing the news conference.``Next believes that several non-technical factors will play keyroles in determining who wins.''   Jobs said Next has been shipping its computers for almost threemonths, and noted that several customers and key software developerswould join in the announcement next week.   Jobs declined to confirm the deal with Businessland or name thesoftware firms, but sources said he would announce development ofspreadsheets, word processors and database programs by LotusDevelopment Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp. and Apple's Claris Corp.   Initially, Next is expected to market its workstations throughBusinessland for scientific and engineering jobs because it alreadyhas some software for those uses. Software for business will takelonger to develop.   The switch from a focus on the education market to the businessand technical market, however, may backfire on Next, said StewartAlsop, publisher of P.C. Letter.   ``You can't run around for three years saying one thing and thenchange it overnight,'' he said. ``And educators, who until now havebeen Next's top priority, are very sensitive to how they rank in theeyes of their suppliers.''   Some analysts wonder whether Next, which has about 250 employees,is ready to meet the demands of selling the computer in the retailmarket.   Alsop said selling retail would be ``fundamentally a mistake''for Next, noting that its computer was not designed for business useand is not compatible with existing standard products.   He added, though, that the computer industry is in a state ofconfusion, particularly in the market for machines such as Next'sthat use versions of ATandamp;T's Unix operating system.   ``Next has an opportunity to walk into the Unix market and setthe standard,'' Alsop said.</TEXT></DOC>
