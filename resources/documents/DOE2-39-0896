The paper points out the much imprvedproblem solution capability of modern microprocessor-based control systems.Data on digital automatic fueling systems for large-scale burners, boilersequence control circuits, digital control systems for heating, ventilationand air conditioning systems, central modular control systems, and buildingservices automation are followed by critical remarks on systems informationwhich for heating experts not too familiar with digital computer systemswas confusing, as well as on the required manual adjustment of too manyparameters (unreliable operation).
