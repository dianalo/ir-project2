The wrongful-death lawsuit accuses former Philippines PresidentFerdinand Marcos, his widow, Imelda, and others of arranging theJune 1981 murders of two Seattle union activists because of theiranti-Marcos activities.   One key witness is Bonifacio Gillego, a one-time member ofMarcos' intelligence network who later rebelled against Marcos andnow is a House member under the government of President CorazonAquino.   Gillego is expected to ``draw a lot of the threads together''from previous testimony about Marcos intelligence agents operatingin the United States, said Sharon Maeda, spokeswoman for theCommittee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes.   Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes were activist reformers in theAlaska Cannery Workers Union. They were shot in union offices inSeattle on June 1, 1981.   As a legislator, Gillego was required to obtain specialpermission to leave the Philippines during the coup emergency, saidDomingo's sister, Cindy Domingo. At last report he had obtainedthat permission, but still faced the task of trying to get a flightout of the country to appear here, probably next week.   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 woundedsince mutineers seized several military installations and bombedthe presidential palace in Manila on Friday, according to the RedCross.   The chances of Gillego being able to attend ``look very good,''Ms. Domingo said Monday. Less certain was the status of RandolphDavid, a Philippines university professor who was scheduled totestify about Marcos' martial-law regime.   If David is unable to leave the Philippines, he would likelygive a deposition by telephone, Ms. Domingo said.   Three men have been convicted of murdering the two men,allegedly in an internal union dispute. But plaintiffs claimMarcos' government marked the men for death because of theiranti-Marcos activities, including support for anti-Marcos tradeunionists in the Philippines.   The suit, filed in September 1982, seeks $30 million on behalfof the men's families. In addition to the Marcoses, defendantsinclude the men convicted of the murders; the Philippinesgovernment; Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco, a Marcos friendwho ran the Mabuhay Corp.; and Constantine Baruso, a former unionpresident whose gun was used in the killings. Baruso was nevercharged in the killings.   It was Gillego, in particular, who drew the plaintiffs'attention to the most important document in the case: a supposedaccount sheet for the Mabuhay Corp., a San Francisco company thatplaintiffs claim was used to funnel money from the Philippines toagents in this country.   That account sheet includes a $15,000 entry that plaintiffsclaim was money used to pay for the murders.</TEXT></DOC>
