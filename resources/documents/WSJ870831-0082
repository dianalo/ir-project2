For example, instead of paging through an index in search of facts, a researcher might &quot;fly&quot; through stacks of information.    A small but growing number of graphic artists specialize in design for computer screens. Some of this is straightforward translation of print concepts to video. Design-conscious software companies, for instance, want their programs to have a consistent look, so they call in graphic designers to provide layouts, typography, logos and other imagery.    &quot;But that's the least of it,&quot; says Bill Verplank, of ID Two, in San Francisco, whose field is &quot;human-interface&quot; design -- how a computer program is presented to the user. This includes not only what images and text appear on the screen, but how the program is arranged conceptually, what keying sequences accomplish which tasks and so forth.    Interface design will require more graphics as computers grow powerful enough to store vast data, according to Aaron Marcus, president of Aaron Marcus andamp; Associates, San Francisco, and a pioneer in graphic design for computers. &quot;Groping your way through these knowledge bases with conventional techniques like menus would be extremely tedious,&quot; he says. &quot;But by using color and animation in three dimensions, we can create elaborate informational edifices that up till now could exist only in the imagination.&quot;    The result would be almost like a video game. To take a simple example, a medical database might take the form of a human body. A researcher could glide through the model, magnifying specific organs or tissue and pushing a key to read data about a precise location.    For now, though, reality keeps designers earthbound. One of Mr. Marcus's clients is Microelectronics andamp; Computer Technology Corp., the research consortium in Austin, Texas. Steven Poltrock, a cognitive psychologist at the consortium, emphasizes a couple of problems. &quot;For one thing,&quot; he says, &quot;nobody has figured out a convenient way to move a cursor in three dimensions. And for another, it's hard to tell where the cursor is in a 3D display.&quot;    Phoney Business   Everyone has seen those little pink or white telephone memos that tell you Ms. Jones returned your call, but what more is there to say about them?    Believe it or not, Stephen B. Wilcox wrote a 40-page report on the subject. Mr. Wilcox is director of Design Research Center, a division of Herbst, Lazar, Rogers andamp; Bell, a Chicago design firm. In redesigning a line of telephone memo books for Avery International's Aigner division, Mr. Wilcox peered over secretaries' shoulders and studied copies in filled-in form books.    A brief sample of his findings: Information is usually written down in this order: caller's name and company, message, caller's phone number, recipient's name, date, time and secretary's signature. The most often checked boxes are &quot;Returned your call&quot; and &quot;Wants to see you.&quot; (&quot;Called to see you&quot; is almost never used.) Message forms tend to get lost on a cluttered desk. There isn't enough room to write on most forms, nor is there a good enough system for indicating which messages need the quickest response.    Michael V. Morris, a graphic designer at Herbst Lazar, used the Wilcox data to redesign the form. Among other things, he invented symbols to replace the check-off boxes and provided colored self-stick labels to flag urgent calls. Aigner says its sales of the new books are up 22% since their unveiling last October.    Cars Fail to Shine   American auto companies, which have been unleashing their designers in recent years in the struggle against European and Japanese imports, still haven't made much of an impression on the public. That, at least, is one conclusion of an image survey by Landor Associates, the large San Francisco design consultancy.    Five European cars -- Lamborghini, Porsche, Mercedes, Jaguar and BMW -- were considered more prestigious than Cadillac, the U.S. leader. For reliability, the highest-rated American car, Oldsmobile, came in 10th.    The Americans fared better in a couple of other categories. Cadillac and Lincoln finished second and third behind Mercedes in luxury, and Ford and Chevrolet came in third and fourth behind Honda and Toyota in practicality.    One surprising result is that the imaginative Japanese still don't have an image for innovation. In that category, eight European cars lead the list, followed by Cadillac and Lincoln. Only then came Nissan, Toyota and Honda. </TEXT></DOC>
