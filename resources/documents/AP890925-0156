Col. William Higgins.   He also appealed again for the release of the body of Higgins,murdered by terrorists who kidnapped him in Lebanon where he headedthe U.N. peacekeeping force.   ``More than 700 peacekeepers have given their lives in serviceto the United Nations'' in its 44-year history, Bush said.   ``Today, I want to remember one of these soldiers of peace. AnAmerican on a mission of peace under the U.N. flag; on a missionfor all the world. A man of unquestioned bravery and unswervingdedication to the U.N. ideal: Lt. Col. William Richard Higgins.   ``I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of thissoldier of peace and call on those responsible to return hisremains to his family,'' Bush said. ``And let us all right now,right here, rededicate ourselves and our nations to the cause thatCol. Higgins served so selflessly.''   Higgins' captors, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, saidJuly 31 it hanged him in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of aMoslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   Higgins was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, and threatened with deathearlier by the terrorists.   U.S. intelligence experts said in early August they wereconvinced by a videotape released by the terrorists that Higginswas dead, but it was not clear when or how he was killed.   U.N.
