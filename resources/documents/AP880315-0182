The woman hired retired U.S. commandos to help her whisk LaurenBayan, 7, off a school bus in Jerash, north of Amman, in lateJanuary, and has kept her whereabouts secret, even from herhusband, since returning to this country, family members confirmed.   Cathy Phelps Mahone now fears her husband could try a similarmaneuver to get the girl back, said Holly Planells, who headsAmerican Children Held Hostage, a Brentwood, N.Y. advocacy groupset up to provide help in international child custody cases.   ``Once you get the child back, it isn't over,'' said Ms.Planells, who has been seeking the return of her own 4-year-old sonfrom Jordan in a similar custody battle.   Ms. Planells said she had been in contact with Ms. Mahone sinceshe and her daughter returned from the Middle East but did not knowher whereabouts other than somewhere in Texas.   Ms. Mahone claims her ex-husband, Jordanian-born Mohammed AliBayan, failed to return the child to her mother after visiting lastHalloween. A Dallas judge gave Ms. Mahone custody after herDecember 1980 divorce, but Bayan reportedly claims custody underJordanian law.   Ms. Mahone has not divulged her whereabouts even to her currenthusband, Lytt, whom she married five years ago.   ``The main thing is their safety and their being together andhopefully not having anything else happen,'' Mahone said in aninterview with the Marshall (Texas) News Messenger.   However, Mahone said he was not in favor of the commandooperation, saying he felt the odds his wife and stepdaughter wouldbe injured were too great.   Ms. Mahone has talked about possible movie and book deals aboutthe raid to bring attention to 2,500 similar cases, Ms. Planellssaid.   An official at the U.S. Embassy in Amman knew the group was inJordan, but was misled about their intentions, State Departmentspokesman Charles Redman said. The embassy officer was recalled toWashington for questioning, he said.   Redman also said the United States had expressed regrets overthe officer's possible involvement in the violation of Jordanianlaw.   Jordanian authorities have had no official comment on the case.But one official, who did not want his name used, said a Jordaniancitizen was involved in getting the girl out of the country.   The man, an employee of an agency that does security work forthe U.S. Embassy, was held for questioning, the official said.   The operation was planned and executed Jan. 28 by CorporateTraining Unlimited, a Fayetteville, N.C., company that specializesin ``hostage rescue training,'' the Philadelphia Inquirer reportedSaturday, quoting anonymous sources close to the participants.   Company president Donald Feeney denied involvement.   Ms. Planells said the operation cost $200,000, but Ms. Mahone'sbrother, David Phelps of Niceville, Fla., said he had been told themercenaries were paid $100,000.   Another brother, Danny Phelps of Woodbridge, N.J., confirmedreports of the rescue were generally correct.   The Phelpses and their sister helped pay some of the costs ofthe mission, the Northwest Florida Daily News of Fort Walton Beachreported.</TEXT></DOC>
