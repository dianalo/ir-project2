Surrounded by green mountains in an isolated corner of Sichuanprovince, the Xichang Satellite Center and its 11-story gantry isthe takeoff point for China's entry into the international satellitelaunching market.   The base, normally closed to foreigners, is on display as Chinaenters final negotiations with Washington on issuing U.S. licensesfor the launch of three Hughes Aircraft Co. satellites. They wouldbe the first American satellites put into orbit by a non-Westerncountry.   Agreement has been reached on safeguarding U.S. technologysecrets during the launch process and establishing China's liabilityin case of accident.   Officials meet again in November to work out how to ensure thatChinese prices, much lower than those charged by the U.S. spaceshuttle or European Ariane services, won't jeopardize the Americancommercial launching industry.   Xichang's first commercial venture could come as early as 1989with the launch of Westar 6, an old satellite retrieved by the spaceshuttle in 1984, for AsiaSat, a Hong Kong consortium.   An Australian company, AUSSAT, intends to put two Hughescommunications satellites into orbit in the early 1990s.   China decided in the mid-1970s to build a rocket base in thisremote area because it is easy to defend, sparsely populated and hasclear winter days well suited for launches.   But while the base is part of China's march to the 21st century,it is surrounded by reminders of the Middle Ages.   The site is 40 miles north of Xichang, a small town accessiblefrom the provincial capital of Chengdu by twice-a-week airplaneflights or a 12-hour train ride.   On the road from Xichang, women wash clothes in streams, waterbuffalo pull wooden plows through rice paddies, and barefootchildren scamper around mud-baked houses. Farmers spread their grainon the road so truck wheels can help grind it.   Between launches, the base looks abandoned.   The site, run by the People's Liberation Army, employs 1,200, butnew buildings to house the 141-foot Long March III rockets andsatellites during pre-launch testing are almost empty.   Windows in the gantry blown out during the last launch in Marchhave yet to be replaced.   About four miles from the launch pad, only two engineers sat atmonitors in the gymnasium-like control center. A smaller controlcenter, built into the mountains at the launch site, was not shownto visitors.   Site officials say the simplicity of the operation is a mainreason for its competitive prices and high success rate. Chinareportedly can undercut space shuttle or Ariane prices by as much as30 percent.   Tong Lianjie, deputy director of the center, said the priceadvantage is ``mainly because our launching facilities are simple,reliable and practical.''   He said the equipment, all produced in China, is relatively cheapand ``technical personnel in China have fairly low salaries. We willnot seek a high profit, although of course we will seek a profit.''   Tong gave assurances China will not pose a threat to othersatellite services. ``Because of the limited number of launches, wecan't be that competitive in the international market.''   Center officials said military control over China's space programis another reason for its successes. Since 1970, when China becamethe fifth nation after the Soviet Union, the United States, Franceand Japan to launch a satellite with its own carrier rocket, it hashad 23 successful launches and one failure.   ``Military discipline is better than that of civilians, who spendhalf the time smoking cigarettes and the other half working,'' saidWang Yongde, deputy director of the center.   China's space program, overseen by the Ministry of Aeronauticsand Astronautics, is concentrating on building a more powerfulversion of the Long March III and adding a second launch pad atXichang by early 1990. This will give China the ability to put apayload of up to 8.8 tons in orbit, compared with 1.4 tons atpresent and 12 tons for the space shuttle.   China has had feelers about its launching services from more thana dozen countries and has signed an agreement with Brazil for futurejoint development of satellites for the study of Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
