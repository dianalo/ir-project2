Berlin, the former Nazi capital, was conquered in the last fewdays of World War II by Soviet troops.   According to previously made agreements, the city was put underthe joint administration of the four victorious powers _ the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, France and Britain _ and each occupied asector of Berlin. The city itself was inside the overall Sovietoccupation zone.   As the East-West relations worsened, the four-poweradministration of Berlin became more and more impractical.   In June 1948, the Soviets blockaded the Western sector to try topush the Western powers out of Berlin, which was a Western enclaveinside the Soviet occupation zone. The U.S.-led Berlin airlift keptabout 2 million people in West Berlin from starving and the Sovietslifted the blockade in May 1949.   When East Germany was founded in 1949, East Berlin wasproclaimed its capital, although that violated previous agreementsthat stipulated that Berlin would belong to none of the occupationzones and that it would retain a special status. This specialstatus is still in force, although the Soviets have put virtuallyall control in local hands.   When West Germany's consitution called West Berlin a statewithin the Federal Republic, the Western Allies complained itviolated the four-power status. The Allies also emphasized theyretained supreme authority over the Western sector, but theyallowed West Berlin's integration into the legal, economic, fiscal,monetary and social system of West Germany.   Although East Germany and the Soviet Union tolerated thissituation for years, after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961,the Communists started obstructing traffic between West Germany andWest Berlin.   In March 1970, the four powers began negotiating over Berlin,recognizing that there could be no relaxation of tensions in Europewithout an agreement over the divided city.   The Four Power Agreement, or the Quadripartite Agreement, wassigned on Sept. 3, 1971, and contains practical steps to improveWest Berlin's situation.   The Soviets no longer disputed the Western presence in WestBerlin, and have accepted its ties to West Germany, includingBonn's right to represent West Berlin internationally.   The 1971 agreement also secured and vastly improved WestBerlin's land, rail and waterway links to West Germany. WestBerliners were permitted again to visit East Berlin and EastGermany and telephone links between the two sides were restored.   But the treaty did not change Berlin's special legal status andthe city remains technically under the four powers' government.West Berlin technically is not part of West Germany and is notgoverned directly from Bonn. Federal laws are applied in WestBerlin under a special procedure.   The Allies, for instance, still control air traffic to WestBerlin, and only U.S., French and British airlines are allowed tomaintain regular service between West Berlin and the outside world.</TEXT></DOC>
