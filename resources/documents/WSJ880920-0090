The reasons: the drought and federal planting restrictions.    The 1988 drought devastated the nation's barley crop, and now Miller and other major brewers fear that they will run out of malting barley by next fall. They are imploring Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to exempt malting barley from all planting limitations in 1989, allowing farmers in Minnesota and the Dakotas to produce as much of it as they like. &quot;We invested millions of (advertising) dollars to position ourselves as an American company brewing a product with domestic ingredients,&quot; says Clifford Williams, a Miller lobbyist. &quot;We don't want to go overseas for malting barley.&quot;    The brewers' plea for special consideration is just one of many entreaties piling up on Mr. Lyng's desk these days as he prepares to make one of the more important farm-policy decisions of the Reagan era: Should farmers be allowed to plant fence-row to fence-row next spring so as to rebuild U.S. stocks of corn, barley and other feed grains following the worst drought in half a century? Or should they be required once again to take part of their crop land out of production, rather than risk a rapid return to price-depressing gluts of farm commodities?    Whatever Mr. Lyng decides, it will cause substantial swings in agricultural supply and demand in 1989 and beyond and will influence supermarket prices. At the same time, his decision will signal to the world just how aggressively the U.S. intends to compete in grain export markets.    This will be a tight-wire act for the agriculture secretary, done in the glare of the presidential race. He is trying to avoid a serious political misstep that would hurt the prospects for Vice President Bush in the Farm Belt.    &quot;We don't want too high prices,&quot; says Richard Loewy, grain analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;It will choke off our competitiveness overseas. But we can't make the mistake of completely opening up the floodgates to excessive planting. We would be right back to a burdensome stocks situation.&quot;    Undoubtedly, Mr. Lyng and his top advisers share that view. &quot;I don't think anyone wants to get back into rapidly rebuilding stocks,&quot; says Ewen Wilson, assistant agriculture secretary for economics.    The 1985 farm law gives Mr. Lyng until Sept. 30 to make up his mind, but he is likely to announce his decision within a few days. Meantime, he has heard a clamor of appeals -- often conflicting -- from food processors and consumer-rights coalitions, individual farmers and producer lobbies, including the corn growers and barley growers.    To qualify for price-support loans and subsidies this year, feed-grain producers were required to idle 20% of their land under the &quot;set-aside&quot; program. The government would also pay farmers to &quot;divert&quot; another 10% of their land this year. But a projected 31% plunge in the U.S. grain crop this year has obviated the need for such stringent restraints on production.    The consensus among lobbyists and congressional staffers here is that so-called paid diversion is a dead issue, at least for 1989. &quot;I don't see how they can talk paid diversion in view of reduced production this drought year,&quot; says Michael Hall, executive vice president of the National Corn Growers Association.    The nation's dwindling stockpiles of wheat are expected to drop to 536 million bushels by next September, enough to meet domestic needs and export demand for only 2.5 months. Corn stockpiles are expected to shrink to 1.6 billion bushels, also enough to last 2.5 months. Under the law, the set-aside requirement for corn and other feed-grain producers can be no more than 12.5% if corn stockpiles are projected to fall below two billion bushels.    Mr. Lyng already has reduced the set-aside requirement for wheat farmers to 10% next year from the current 27.5%, and he has also discontinued the option of paid diversion for wheat.    Privately, Mr. Lyng has told a few lobbyists that he is inclined toward reducing the feed-grain set-aside to 10% from 20%. That would restore parity between the feed grains and wheat programs. But more importantly, it would bring an immense amount of land back into production next year. Currently, 78 million acres of crop land -- a farm as vast as New Mexico -- are lying fallow under the government's setaside and other programs.    Continental Grain Co. and other major players in the grain trade would prefer a zero set-aside. &quot;They favor unrestricted planting. They want all the supply they can get,&quot; says an Agriculture Department official. &quot;When you're in the exporting business, you make money on volume.&quot;    Food processors -- including the beer industry, which spends $860 million a year on malting barley, hops, corn and rice -- also would welcome a sharp increase in production to bring down prices. Meanwhile, the equally price-conscious producers are leery of removing the set-aside requirement altogether. The American Farm Bureau is calling for a 10% set-aside, half of which would be a paid diversion. The corn growers are lobbying for no more than 10%.    &quot;I don't know which viewpoint is going to prevail,&quot; says Mr. Wilson, the department's top economist. &quot;But there's no question that there will be great sensitivity to producer lobbies in a year like this.&quot;    The corn growers, in particular, want to avoid being swamped by their own production, as happened in the mid-1980s following a drought. &quot;Even with a 10% set-aside next year,&quot; says Mr. Hall, &quot;we could easily come close to repeating the record production of 8.9 billion bushels in 1986.&quot;    More than just the prodigious capacity of U.S. agriculture to produce bumper crops is complicating Mr. Lyng's decision. There also is a recently enacted drought-relief package, which allows farmers to plant soybeans and oats on their feed-grain acreage without the penalty of lost subsidies. Supplies of both drought-damaged crops are rapidly tightening. Mr. Hall expects farmers to switch at least four million acres to soybeans from corn next year.    Meanwhile, the National Barley Growers Association and the big brewers, including Anheuser-Busch Inc., St. Louis, and Stroh Brewery Co., Detroit, are at odds over malting barley. The brewers are urging Mr. Lyng to invoke a farm-law provision and exempt malting barley growers in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, the primary growing area, from any set-aside requirement. The drought, according to their estimates, cut the tri-state crop 80% to 35 million bushels. Malting barley prices soared to between $4.50 and $5 a bushel from $2 last summer, making French barley competitive with barley from the Dakotas.    &quot;Unless the exemption is implemented, we run the risk of shortages,&quot; says John Busby, president of Fleischmann-Kurth/ADM Malting Co., a major Milwaukee-based supplier. &quot;We'll have to look offshore.&quot; And that would be an ironic turnabout: &quot;Here we have an export enhancement program to create overseas markets for our barley, yet we may be forcing our industry to buy barley from the very countries we are battling&quot; in trade talks.    The barley growers don't see any great shortage looming. &quot;The brewers want more production to bring prices down,&quot; says James Howe, a Casselton, N.D., grower. The group says it will support a set-aside exemption for malting barley, but only if Mr. Lyng guarantees that the government will subsidize the export of at least three million metric tons of feed-grain barley. But under the law, Mr. Lyng can't do that. Export subsidies are meted out on a case-by-case basis.    &quot;It's a case of policy going haywire,&quot; complains former North Dakota Sen. Mark Andrews, who grows malting barley on his Red River Valley farm. </TEXT></DOC>
