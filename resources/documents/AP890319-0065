A court also charged Mohamed Sulaiman Alfan Saturday withunlawfully possessing 853 hippopotamus teeth valued at $224,according to the Sunday News. Police said Alfan shipped the tusks onMarch 7 to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, according to the newsreport.   If convicted, Alfan faces a possible 14 years in prison underTanzania's Economic and Organized Crime Control Act.   The report did not specify whether Alfan came from North or SouthYemen, both on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.   According to East African conservationists, the United ArabEmirates has become the major distributing center for illegalelephant ivory.   High international prices for ivory continue to fuel widespreadpoaching that already has cut Africa's elephant population in halfsince the late 1970s, according to a 1987 U.N. Environmental study.   In January, the government intercepted 184 elephant tusks beingsmuggled out of the country by former Indonesian Ambassador HusseinJoesoef.
