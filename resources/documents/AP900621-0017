Sorry, we'll come back. You're standing up. Ican't see you.   Q: Mr. President, are you planning to support a G-7 initiativeto offer economic aid to the Soviet Union at next month's economicsummit? And if so, what has caused you to change your mind on that?   Bush: No, I'm not planning to do that, and I expect, though,that matter may be discussed. There are _ I've tried to be very upfront with Mr. Gorbachev when he was here about difficulties interms of financial support. I talked to him in Malta about that.   Indeed, we presented him with a list of things that might bedone to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with themon that.   But I don't plan a new _ a new initiative. And yet, I want tosee perestroika continue. I haven't changed my view that economicreform is important, and I recognize that support from the West canwell _ can well help the economy.   But there is an awful lot of reform that has to take place inthe market and the distribution systems. There's some politicalproblems that we have that I've discussed very frankly with Mr.Gorbachev, not the least of them $5 billion a year going down toCuba.   So we've still got some problems there, but discount the factthat we are planning some bold new initiative. On the other hand,I'm perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject, and Ithink that will probably be one of them.   Q: Well there are reports that President Mitterrand wouldpropose such a plan. Is that _   Bush: Well, the Germans are interested, too, and I'm not sayingwe're not interested, but I am saying there are some formidableobstacles.   Yeah, Jim?   Q: Back on the PLO, one of the theories passed around in yourown administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack wasto derail the peace process. Are you at all concerned that bysuspending the dialogue you're playing into the hands of thehard-liners like Abu Abbus? And is there also a danger _   Bush: Yes. Let me stop you there, just to respond, so I don'tget _ forget the question. Yes I am concerned about that. Go ahead.(Scattered laughter.)   Q: Well, if you're so concerned about it, then why did you _ whydid you take this action?   Bush: Well, because we had to weigh the whole question and thequestion was complicated by the fact that there were three specificundertakings, one of which, a very important one in my view, hasclearly has been violated.   So _ but _ it's not an easy call, because I know some feel thatthe PLO dialogue is totally unproductive, and as I indicated inthis statement, I don't.   And the question up here was, well, do our allies _ will theyagree with the steps that I've taken here in Huntsville today? Andthe answer is, no, some of them will not agree, because they dofeel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some partsof the Middle East.   So _ so, what the answer to it is, is for the PLO to take theaction that I've called for and to satisfactorily _ to satisfy usthat those who were responsible will be disciplined, and condemnthis specific act. It's not enough to simply reiterate one'sconcern on terror.   Q: If I may follow up?   Bush: Please.   Q: Is there a danger, too, that those Palestinians who would putsome hope in the dialogue between the PLO and the U.S. might nowthrow up their hands in desperation and resort to violence?   Bush: Well, I hope that's not the case, and yet _ I would referyou to the very last page of my _ last paragraph or two of thestatement, when I did call for no violence, and I think it's fairto say that at any time you're dealing with something ascomplicated as the Middle East, you worry about that.   But I hope that's not the case, and I hope they'll see in mystatement a rather temperate view here that, though we're specificin calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act,that once that is done, in keeping with the Arafat's _ Arafat'sundertaking, that we can resume talks.   There has been a frustration, Jim, in the Arab world that thisdialogue has not resulted in more progress, and I understand thefrustration. I don't happen to agree with it. I think things arebetter because we've had the dialogue, but Israel has stronglyobjected to it and some Palestinians have been, as we can clearlysee, concerned about it. But I believe that we ought to try to finda way to get it back at some point.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
