(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man with AIDS forced an 8-year-oldrelative to have oral sex, the child and a prosecutor told jurorsFriday in a test case of a new state law.   Randall Lee Dempsey, 34, of rural Marion is charged withcriminal transmission of the HIV virus and aggravated criminalsexual assault. He has pleaded innocent to the charges.   The case is believed the first test of the state's new criminalHIV transmission law, which took effect Sept. 11, 1989.   ``This is a classic case of child sex abuse in the familysetting. But there is one unique and quite dangerous element tothis case,'' Williamson County State's Attorney Charles Garnatisaid in his opening statement.   ``He (Dempsey) did so after testing positive for the HIV virusand he did so after being told by his own doctor that he wasinfected with the HIV virus.''   The defense made no opening statement Friday.   Under the law, the attacker must know he is carrying the AIDSvirus when he performs an act, such as sexual intercourse, whichwould expose someone to the virus. Conviction does not require thatthe victim develop AIDS.   It is not known if the boy has been tested for the virus.Lawyers say they are bound by state law not to discuss the caseoutside the courtroom.   If convicted, Dempsey faces up to seven years in prison on thetransmission charge and up to 30 years on the assault charge. Hewas being held in the Williamson County Jail on $50,000 bond.   Garnati said Dempsey returned to Marion from California to livewith his parents after becoming ill. Blood tests Dempsey underwentfor the HIV virus in December turned up positive.   ``The defendant's mother will tell you that the defendant neverreally did accept the fact that he was infected with the HIVvirus,'' Garnati told the jury.   Garnati told jurors that on May 27, the child slept in the samebed with Dempsey, and that Dempsey forced the youth to have oralsex against the boy's objections.   The boy told a relative the next morning, despite Dempsey'spromise to give him a pet turtle to keep quiet, Garnati said.   ``How did a little 8-year-old boy know how to describe somethinglike that?'' Garnati asked.   ``The only conclusion is that he is telling the truth and thatman did it,'' he said, pointing at Dempsey.   The boy, now 9, answered attorneys with short sentences andappeared cheerful throughout Friday's testimony.   In his cross-examination, Public Defender Larry Broeking askedthe boy about statements he made to his father denying that abuseoccurred. But under Garnati's questioning, the child insistedDempsey assaulted him.   After testifying, the boy waved happily to Dempsey and climbeddown from the witness stand.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the body's defensesagainst disease, leaving a person prey to life-threateninginfections and certain cancers.   The fatal, incurable disease is spread by a virus transmittedmainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles andfrom infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.   In infected people, the AIDS virus is found in blood and semen.</TEXT></DOC>
