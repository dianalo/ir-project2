Buffett said in an unusual two-pagenewspaper advertisement. &quot;In the past that has neither beenthe expectation at Salomon nor the practice.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The pay move -- announced as the firm reported itsthird-quarter earnings yesterday -- is a clear signal of Mr.Buffett's determination to slash what he sees as Salomon'ssky-high pay. Last year, 106 employees at the firm's SalomonBrothers Inc. securities unit each made $1 million or more insalary and bonuses, even though, Mr. Buffett noted, SalomonBrothers earned a mediocre 10% return on equity. Salomon'scompensation plan, Mr. Buffett complained, rewarded employeesand businesses that didn't do well.   Mr. Buffett's pay shock comes as Salomon is seeking toovercome its Treasury scandal, in which the firm has admittedit repeatedly violated government auction-bidding rules. AndMr. Buffett, in his public statement, acknowledged thatSalomon's new &quot;pay-for-performance philosophy willundoubtedly cause some managers to leave.&quot;   But he expressed the hope that Salomon's top-performingbankers and traders will choose to stay-even as he indicatedthat Salomon's shareholders are equally important. &quot;It isappropriate that the excess earnings of the exceptionalperformers -- that is, what they generate beyond what theyare justly paid -- go to the stockholders,&quot; said Mr. Buffett,who has a 16% stake in Salomon.   Investors cheered the new pay policy. Yesterday, Salomon'sstock jumped $2.25 a share, or 8.6%, to $28.375 in late NewYork Stock Exchange trading. Yesterday's turnover of threemillion shares -- nearly three times average volume -- madeSalomon the fourth-most-active issue on the Big Board. In thepast two days, Salomon's shares have surged nearly 15%.   As expected, Salomon announced that it earned $85 million,or 60 cents a share, in the third quarter despite taking a$200 million reserve for potential liability from itsTreasury auction-bidding scandal. The combined effect of thereserve and pay shift amounted to a reduction in net incomeof about $75 million, Salomon said.   If not for the big compensation cut, however, Salomonwould have been in the red after the reserve, analysts said.&quot;They basically reduced the bonus pool and managed theearnings to show a profit,&quot; said Lawrence Eckenfelder, abrokerage analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.   Said John Keefe, an analyst for Lipper AnalyticalSecurities Inc.: &quot;It could have been a lot worse, but it'snot as good as it looks.&quot;   Mr. Buffett said that the $110 million &quot;downwardadjustment&quot; in the money Salomon had previously set aside forbonuses would bring the firm's 1991 compensation to below1990 levels. Salomon's compensation year ended Sept. 30, and1991 bonuses will be doled out in December.   The compensation cuts had some Salomon employees seething.&quot;The whole thing is pernicious,&quot; groused a senior Salomonexecutive. &quot;The $200 million charge is for {something} wedidn't do.&quot; The reserve stems from Salomon's admissions thatits government-bond desk made unauthorized bids for customersand repeatedly violated Treasury rules that bar a singledealer from buying more than 35% of a single Treasury issueat auction.   Following a growing trend on Wall Street, Mr. Buffett saidthat Salomon employees will now have to take more of theirpay in the form of Salomon common stock -- shares they won'tbe allowed to sell for five years.   This move effectively ties investment bankers and tradersto Salomon, since they couldn't immediately cash in theirstock if they quit. Many big securities firms, in a throwbackto the old days of Wall Street partnerships, now requireemployees to plow back more of their bonuses into the firms.   The Salomon stock plan &quot;motivates managers to think likeowners, since it obliges them to hold the stock they buy forat least five years and therefore exposes them to the risksof the business as well as the opportunities,&quot; said Mr.Buffett.   In its earnings release, Salomon said third-quarter netrose 7.6% from $79 million, or 55 cents a share, in theyear-earlier period. Total revenue fell 5.8%, to $2.42billion from $2.57 billion a year earlier. Reflecting the newpay policy, compensation and benefit costs dropped 58%, to$212 million from $509 million.   Salomon Brothers posted pretax profit of $194 million forthe quarter, more than triple the $60 million of a yearearlier. The results were boosted by bond-trading gains,although principal transactions for Salomon Inc. -- in whichthe firm uses its own money -- slumped 35%, to $609 millionfrom $939 million a year earlier. Investment banking revenuejumped 28% to $146 million from $114 million.   Salomon's Phibro Energy Inc. oil trading and refiningunit, however, reported pretax profit of just $10 million --sharply lower than the record $369 million of 1990's thirdquarter. Refining margins were squeezed in 1991's thirdquarter, while 1990's third-quarter results were boosted bysurging oil prices in the wake of the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait, analysts said.   For the nine months, Salomon had net of $536 million, or$4.31 a share, a 69% jump over the $318 million, or $2.32 ashare, in the year-earlier period. Salomon Brothers' pretaxprofit of $1 billion in the nine months was nearly double the$506 million of the year-earlier period. But Phibro's pretaxprofit of just $26 million was far below the $430 million ofa year earlier. Nine-month total revenue rose 8.6% to $7.62billion from the $7.02 billion in the year-earlier period.   As expected, Salomon disclosed that it has shrunk its bigbalance sheet by more than $53 billion through massivesecurities sales since August; the firm currently has about$97 billion of assets. Mr. Buffett said yesterday he expectsthe balance sheet to be reduced further.   Salomon still will pay employees bonuses based on aformula tied to their individual performance and that oftheir department. But the firm is sure to abandon, amongother things, the special pay arrangements that had beennegotiated between former Chairman John Gutfreund and someSalomon departments; those pay pacts, launched last year,triggered huge bonuses for some top Salomon traders --including $23 million to Lawrence Hilibrand, a bond-arbitragetrader.   The compensation changes won't affect a specialdeferred-pay pool that will be divvied up among about 115Salomon managing directors early next year. Launched in 1988,the deferred-compensation plan was intended to keep keyemployees from defecting, which they were doing in massnumbers at the time. The pot has now swelled to more than$130 million with interest.   The new pay policy, moreover, isn't likely to shut outSalomon's top producers. &quot;Employees who produce exceptionalresults for the firm, while operating both honorably andwithout excessive risk, should expect to receive first-classcompensation,&quot; Mr. Buffett said.</TEXT></DOC>
