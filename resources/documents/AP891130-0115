Police headquarters refused to release the name of the31-year-old suspect, saying it confirmed his arrest only afternewspapers reported it. An official statement said further arrestsin the slayings were possible.   An evening news report on government-run TV said it was believedpolice ``are looking at the possible existence of a privateassassination squad with strong right-wing links.''   The suspect, a white former police sergeant, was arrested thismonth in the killings of David Webster, a university lecturer andhuman rights activist in Johannesburg, and Anton Lubowski, a lawyerwho was the only senior white official of Namibia's mainindependence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.   Both men were shot to death outside their homes; Webster on May1 in Johannesburg and Lubowski on Sept. 12 in Windhoek, Namibia.   The suspect had not been charged and was being held forquestioning under the provisions of security legislation thatallows for indefinite detention without access to visitors orlawyers.   The Star, a liberal Johannesburg daily, said the suspect'sfather had filed an application demanding his son's release from aJohannesburg police station cell, but later withdrew the request.   Police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder andtheft. He was convicted of killing a suspect in one of hisinvestigations as a narcotics officer for the West Rand, a regionwest of Johannesburg.   ``The person has been in detention for some time,'' police said.``The police did not wish to announce his detention because thiswould have jeopardized an investigation which still has to belaunched.''   The national police force has come under widespread criticismfor its failure to solve the Webster murder and dozens of otherkillings of anti-apartheid activists over the past 10 years.   The arrest coincides with a government investigation intoallegations by former policemen that police death squads, acting onorders from superiors, killed numerous government opponents.   An Irish national, Donald Acheson, 51, was arrested in Namibiathe day after Lubowski was killed. He had been held as an illegalimmigrant, but on Nov. 6 was told he would be charged in theslaying.   Newspapers have reported that Acheson was taken to Johannesburgfor interrogation by authorities who fought the court applicationfor the ex-narcotics officer's release. Those authorities also areinvestigating Webster's assassination.
