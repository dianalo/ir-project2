DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael R. Milken, the embattled junk bond chiefof Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is being cut off from the firm _without most of his pay _ according to the plea bargain Drexelstruck to settle the nation's largest securities fraud case.   The bad news for Milken, considered the driving force behindDrexel's leap from Wall Street obscurity, came in a 12-page pleaagreement signed by Drexel officials Tuesday and made publicWednesday.   Milken's attorney condemned the deal as ``punishment withouttrial, sentence before verdict.''   Drexel also agreed it would not pay Milken's brother, seniorcompany aide Lowell J. Milken, half of what is due him in 1988.   Both Milkens were named along with Drexel in a Securities andExchange Commission insider trading civil lawsuit in September.   Neither brother has been charged with any criminal activity andboth have denied wrongdoing. But Michael Milken is considered one ofthe biggest remaining targets of the investigation and is expectedto be indicted soon on racketeering and fraud charges.   Milken heads Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high yield``junk'' bond department and is one of the most dynamic financiersof the decade. Said to be one of the country's wealthiest people,Milken reportedly makes $200 million a year, mostly in a yearlybonus paid in the following year.   Denying him most of his 1988 money not only would seriously crimpMilken's legal-defense war chest but would go a long way towarddefraying the cost of Drexel's own settlement of criminal charges.   The agreement also required Drexel to pay $500 million of the$650 million penalty on the day it enters a guilty plea, a datewhich U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said will not be set untilafter the SEC approves the settlement.   A Drexel lawyer said that approval may be worked out by earlynext week, according to a court transcript unsealed Wednesday.   ``We are meeting with them almost on daily basis eight or ninehours a day,'' Drexel lawyer Thomas F. Curnin told U.S. DistrictJudge Kimba Wood Tuesday.   ``And we may well have an agreement with the SEC, particularly ifwe work through the weekend, by next Monday or Tuesday,'' he added,according to the transcript.   Drexel also must pay 8.5 percent interest on the initial $500million up until the day it enters a guilty plea.   ``There is no change in Mr. Milken's position, and his attorneysare continuing to prepare to defend him against any charges that maybe brought,'' said defense lawyer Martin Flumenbaum, adding that theagreement's provisions requiring Drexel to fire Milken ``and torefuse to pay him the compensation for his service due in 1988 is aviolation of due process and an infringement of Mr. Milken'sconstitutional rights.''   ``Drexel chief executive Fred Joseph has consistently maintainedhe has no indication Lowell Milken did anything wrong,'' saiddefense lawyer, Michael Armstrong.   He added: ``Drexel has been forced to punish some one it hascharacterized as blameless in order to avoid being put out ofbusiness by a ruinous (racketeering) indictment.''   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, agreed toplead guilty to six felony charges and pay a record $650 million infines and restitution. The specific counts, revealed by federalprosecutors Tuesday, included allegations of illegal dealings withdisgraced stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and the defunct securitiesfirm, Princeton-Newport Partners.   The plea bargain agreement ``does not provide any protectionwhatsoever from criminal prosecution or civil liability to anyindividual or to entity other than Drexel,'' it said in part.   The agreement called for Drexel to pay $300 million in criminalfines and civil penalties. The remaining $350 million will be placedin an escrow account that ``will be used to compensate civilclaimants'' who may sue over losses sustained by Drexel's actions.   Under the plea bargain, Drexel also agreed to put any indictedemployee on a leave of absence and fire them if they are convicted.So far, no current Drexel employee has been indicted in the two-yearprobe.   Drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in thecountry. It is a leader in the $175 billion market for ``junk bond''securities, often used to finance takeovers and the growth of small-to medium-sized companies.</TEXT></DOC>
