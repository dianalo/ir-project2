General geometrically non-linear analyses show thatthe vertical vibration of the riser is, in practice, not coupled withthe lateral deflection and vibrations of the riser. Thus axial vibrationcan be analysed separately, which makes analyses much cheaper. Rauma-Repolahas developed an efficient micro computer program RDA (Riser DynamicAnalysis) to study the static and dynamic behaviour of the deep oceanmining risers. The program has been verified with comparison of the resultswith ANSYS FEM program results. RDA has proved to be reliable for designpurposes and it is much more efficient than general purpose FEM programs.</TEXT></DOC>
