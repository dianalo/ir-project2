<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0459 </DOCNO><TEXT>The contributions to the periastron advance of a system of two condensedbodies coming from relativistic dynamical effects of order higher thanthe usual first post-Newtonian (1PN) equations of motion are investigated.The structure of the solution of the orbital second post-Newtonian (2PN)equations of motion is given in a simple parametrized form. The contributionsto the secular pariastron advance, and the period, of orbital 2PN effectsare then explicitly worked out by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. Thespin-orbit contribution to the secular precession of the orbit in spaceis rederived in a streamlined way by making full use of Hamiltonian methods.These results are then applied to the theoretical interpretation of theobservational data of pulsars in close eccentric binary systems. It isshown that the higher-order relativistic contributions are already oftheoretical and astophysical significance for interpreting the high-precisionmeasurement of the secular periastron advance of PSR 1913+16 achivedby Taylor and coworkers. The case of extremely fast spinning (millisecond)binary pulsars is also discussed, and shown to offer an easier groundfor getting new tests of general relativity, and/or, a direct measurementof the moment of inertia of a neutron star.</TEXT></DOC>
