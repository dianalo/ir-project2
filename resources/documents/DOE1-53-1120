<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-53-1120 </DOCNO><TEXT>An apparatus for recording the shape of wide-band, single, impulsive signals,assembled based on an eight-bit K1107PV2 analog-to-digital converter(a.d.c) of the parallel type, is described. The device is intended forbuilding systems for recording fast processes and it gives an error inthe conversion of the input signal of not more than +/- 1 low-order bitof the a.d.c. in a frequency band up to 10 MHz. The apparatus is equippedwith memory, storing 1024 readings from the a.d.c sequentially in timeand is assembled in the CAMAC standard in a one-module station.</TEXT></DOC>
