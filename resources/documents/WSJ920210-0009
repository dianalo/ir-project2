Harkin, Vigorous Applause   Doesn't Necessarily Mean Solid Support   ----   By Michel McQueen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/10/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><NS>POLITICS (PLT)</NS><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   SALEM, N.H. -- In the living room of a Democratic activisthere, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin is doing something he does verywell: getting die-hard Democrats all riled up.   A vote for him in the Feb. 18 presidential primary, hetells a roomful of Pat Kerrigan's neighbors, means a vote fortraditional Democratic values, reinvestment in America,commitment to the working class, and most of all, a messageto George Bush.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We'll send a shocker around this country and around thisworld,&quot; he says to vigorous applause from his listeners.   The problem is that even though they're clapping, theyaren't necessarily buying. Of the two dozen people in theroom, only a handful walk away committed. &quot;He impressed methat he knows what he's talking about,&quot; says Angela Bramante,a retiree attending the coffee with her husband Fred, but sheisn't convinced. &quot;I think it's important to listen to whatthey're all saying at this point.&quot;   This is how it goes for Tom Harkin in the waning days ofthe race. He has endorsements -- 54 New Hampshire statedelegates, nearly half the Democratic delegation, as well assome key labor backers. He has certain victory in the Iowacaucuses, eight days before the primary here. He has enoughmoney on hand to stay on the airwaves through election day.And he has a strong message -- &quot;I'm the only real Democrat inthe race,&quot; say his ads. Moreover, as the only red-meatliberal in a field where most of the candidates are trying totailor a more centrist appeal, Mr. Harkin presumably ought tobe able to garner the 30% to 35% that presumably would beneeded to win.   But somehow or another, the passion he projects hasn'ttranslated into a meaningful impact on the race or a firmfoundation of voter support. Weekend polls in New Hampshireshow Mr. Harkin mired at around 10%, well behind the leaders,Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and former Massachusetts Sen. PaulTsongas.   Mr. Harkin already has scapegoats to explain his failureto catch fire: He blames the press for giving him &quot;a rawdeal&quot; by misrepresenting him as a big government spender orignoring him entirely. The latter charge seems hard tosustain given the entourage of reporters trailing him in NewHampshire last week. But mispresented or not, Mr. Harkin'sstrongly protectionist message on trade and his calls forinvestment in &quot;human capital,&quot; for a comprehensive thoughstill-undefined national health care system, for an increasein federal spending for education, and for a series ofnational service options for young people -- coupled with anangry, &quot;give 'em hell&quot; delivery -- still seem to strike manyvoters as the remedies of the past and not the future.   Mr. Harkin shows few signs of softening his sometimessearing message. One recent commercial does strike a lessangry note, emphasizing his role in passing the landmarkAmericans with Disabilities Act and featuring his brotherFrank, who is deaf. But at the same time, Harkin radio adslast week lambasted opponents Clinton, Tsongas and NebraskaSen. Bob Kerrey as &quot;weak Democrats&quot; for supporting a tradepact with Mexico that Sen. Harkin claims would &quot;send yourjobs abroad.&quot; And a new TV commercial on trade launched overthe weekend shows scenes from China's bloody crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, with Mr.Harkin vowing that as president he would keep out productsmade by &quot;slave labor.&quot;   Sen. Harkin says he may be frustrated but isn'tdiscouraged by his lack of progress in New Hampshire so far,and political observers here note that in many recent NewHampshire primaries, victory has gone to the candidate whogets hot in the campaign's closing days. And Harkin partisansmaintain that his position as the only full-speed-aheadliberal could yet give him such an opening. Insists thecandidate himself: &quot;I believe the message is right, themomentum is right, the timing is right.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
