But traders are arguing about whether its recent price gains will continue.    &quot;There's been a clear shift&quot; in investor sentiment toward the silver market, said Jeffrey Christian, managing director of Christian, Podleska, and van Musschenbroek Ltd., a New York commodity consulting firm.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver futures prices for May delivery, the most active contract, rose 5.5 cents an ounce, to $6.355, after rising to $6.53 at one point. Estimated volume was about 50,000 contracts, about triple the typical turnover. May silver prices have risen seven of the past nine sessions, surging 77 cents, or 14%, in that time; the last time prices closed higher was Oct. 3, 1985, when they stood at $6.385 an ounce.    Traders said most of the price movement has been sparked by computer-guided technical buying, mainly through commodity pools, or professionally managed investor funds. In addition, some of the futures demand has been triggered by option-related buying, some analysts said.    Moreover, for the first time in several years there has been renewed bullion buying from Asia and Middle East, some analysts said. And some traders have been buying silver and selling gold contracts, taking advantage of the large ratio of gold prices over silver, some brokers said.    Over the long term, the lower U.S. dollar and prospects of higher inflation have added to investor interest, along with rising industrial demand and minting of silver coins, some analysts said.    The increased interest also has stemmed from improving fundamental factors, several analysts added. Mr. Christian noted, for example, that the 200 million ounces of reported world silver inventories as of the end of last year is the lowest level since 1983.    Nevertheless, ample supplies of silver remain. Handy andamp; Harman, in a recent review of the silver market, said it &quot;appears that existing stocks can readily accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation.&quot;    And some traders and analysts suggested that the recent rally might be fizzling, noting that yesterday's close was well off the day's highs. &quot;That's a warning signal and shows the market is vulnerable,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Others, however, say the run-up is far from over. Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co. in New York, said if silver prices close above $6.45 an ounce, &quot;$7.50 is right around the corner.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Congressional testimony by the U.S. trade representative helped futures recover some of Wednesday's big declines, which were fueled by increases in the prime lending rate by U.S. banks. Sentiment on the dollar remains overwhelmingly bearish, traders and analysts say. In yesterday's Congressional testimony, Clayton Yeutter said a futher drop in the dollar would help the U.S. trade balance. While the statement helped strengthen foreign currency futures, Mr. Yeutter's &quot;implicit threats&quot; of an intensified trade war with Japan were also a factor, said Jill Cotter, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securites Inc. Congress's override of President Reagan's veto of the transportation bill also could be bearish for the dollar and bullish for foreign currency futures, said Daniel Weissman, head of trading at Manfra, Tordella andamp; Brookes Inc. &quot;A more aggressive, Democratic Congress will look to pass trade legislation and push for a lower dollar,&quot; he said.    INTEREST RATES: Futures went into a late slump after rising earlier in the session. The fall-off came on weakness in the dollar and concern over the government's unemployment report due this morning, analysts said. In addition, they said, Congress's override of President Reagan's veto of the transportation bill was bad news for deficit-conscious traders.    COFFEE: Futures prices continued to hover around $1 a pound despite Brazil's opening of registration for coffee to be shipped in May. The May contract on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York rose 1.72 cents a pound to settle at $1.01. But Brazil's stiffer tax regulations on shipments helped ward off a flood of selling by exporters, those in the trade said. The new restrictions will tend to minimize shipments of coffee that haven't already been sold, they said. The futures market action, though, was &quot;actually lackluster and temporary,&quot; an analyst said. The Brazilian development, he said, &quot;isn't enough to offset the basic bearishness of the market, with its burdensome supplies and slow demand for green coffee.&quot; Brazil's export tax was tripled to 15% of the value of the the shipment, trade sources said. More important, though, exporters will be required to pay 50% of the tax within 72 hours of registration or lose the right to register further shipments of coffee for 60 days. Exporters will be required to pay the balance of the tax at the time of shipment. Meanwhile, offering prices from Brazil were relatively expensive, importers said. One importer was offered Santos 4's, a basic grade of Brazilian coffee, at between $1 a pound and $1.02, delivered in New York, and the better-quality Santos 2's and Santos 3's at $1.08 and higher, he said. Colombian coffees, which normally range higher in price than Brazilian coffees, were being offered at $1.08 a pound to $1.09, but Colombia was offering a rebate of almost 6 1/4 cents a pound, so its coffees are &quot;actually cheaper than Brazil's,&quot; a New York importer said. Prices for Central American coffees after concessions are less than Brazil's, the importer said. Another importer said lower-quality Brazilian coffee could be obtained as low as 95 cents a pound, and at 10 cents less than the July futures price, or about 93 cents, another importer said. </TEXT></DOC>
