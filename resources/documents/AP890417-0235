(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A chemical ancient Babylonians extractedfrom figs to treat skin ailments is being used to develop animalvaccines and may prove to be important in detecting and fightinghuman viruses, a researcher says.   The value of the chemicals, called psoralens, for virusdetection and vaccine development lies in their ability to bind thetwined double strands of the DNA molecule, said John E. Hearst, aUniversity of California, Berkeley, chemistry professor whoreported his work to the American Chemical Society.   Because psoralen molecules are flat, they can slip between thetwo strands of DNA without affecting the DNA itself. When psoralensare struck by light, they bind with the DNA, locking the twostrands of the structure together.   Vaccines are generally prepared by first killing a virus withformaldehyde and then placing the dead viral material into the bodyso the immune system can recognize proteins on the virus' outercoat and develop defenses. Formaldehye reacts with some viralproteins, so this is not always successful. By locking viralgenetic material, psoralens rob a virus of its ability to replicate.   Psoralens, used in Babylon as far back as 4,000 B.C. to treatskin pigmentation diseases, occur naturally in figs, some otherplants and in some microorganisms. They sensitize the skin,promoting rapid tanning, and were used in tanning lotions until theFood and Drug Administration labeled them as possible cancercausers a few years ago.   Hearst said psoralens also can be used in DNA probes, segmentsof a DNA strand for a particular virus that is placed in a bloodsample to bind to the particular virus or bacteria. By counting thefree-floating DNA probes after the test, scientists can determinewhether a particular virus is present.   Because DNA probe bindings are generally weak, many are notmaintained during the counting, he said, adding that if psoralensare attached to the DNA probes, the binding is much stronger.</TEXT><HEAD>Researchers Studying Question Of Growing Food In Space</HEAD><DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of the tough questions arising outof years-long space missions or life in a space station are what todo about sunlight, soil and gravity. Not for the astronauts _ fortheir food.   ``On short missions it's a lot easier to resupply space stationswith TV dinners than to have astronauts grow their own food. Ifyou're going to Mars or beyond, it would become cheaper to growit,'' said Gale Nevill, a University of Florida aerospace engineerworking on space-based ways to grow crops.   Plants can recycle nutrients and other valuable elements thatotherwise would be discarded. Without recycling, astronauts wouldhave to replace carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and others elements withcostly, regular shipments from Earth.   But growing wheat, rice, soybeans and other crops can be tricky.   ``Right now, there are more problems than solutions,'' said BillKnott, chief scientist for NASA's Controlled Ecological LifeSupport System project. ``There are some engineering problems ingrowing plants in microgravity. You can't go pouring water on aplant because it floats all over the place.''   Although models will be tested on Earth in five to 10 years, itcould be 20 to 50 years before automated planting and harvestingtechnology reaches space.   Scientists are patterning the system after Earth: Plants takenutrition from manure and other waste products and produce food.Humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide; plants use thecarbon dioxide and produce oxygen.   One problem associated with the lack of gravity is thatnutrient-laden water tends to rise through roots and stems so fastthat the plant doesn't have time to extract nutrients. Researchershave designed a tiny collar to stop this flow, but the problem hasyet to be solved completely, Nevill said.   Scientists hope to reduce the time between harvests by aboutone-third, Knott said. Because of the limited area available forcrops in a space station, the systems must yield three to 20 timesmore than an Earth farmer could grow.</TEXT><HEAD>Scientist Report Signs Of Acid-Snow Damage</HEAD><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of fragile mountain lakes in the Westcould be endangered from acid snow, which already is causingenvironmental damage, says a researcher who has spent eight yearsstudying the problem in Colorado.   One possible sign of the effects of acid precipitation is a dropin the number of neotene tiger salamanders in Mexican Cut, nearCrested Butte, as acid levels rose, said John Harte, a Universityof California professor.   ``The decline of this salamander population may be the firstindication of biological damage from acid precipitation in thewestern United States,'' Harte said. He said he traced the acidpollution to coal-burning power plants, metal smelters and caremissions hundreds of miles away.   He cautioned that his study, to be published in June, did notprove acid snow to be the undisputed cause, because the salamanderssometimes are subject to natural population fluctuations, and LarrySvoboda, of the Environmental Protection Agency, said eight yearsof study may not be enough.   The research is significant because EPA has found that 6,500high-elevation ponds and lakes in the West are highly vulnerable toacid precipitation. Such damage has been documented for years inthe Northeast, but not in the West.   At issue is a symptom known as acid pulse, which happens eachspring when the snow melts. The pollutants contained in the snowsurge downstream into a string of 15 ponds in Mexican Cut, at11,000 feet up in the Rockies.   Harte found that without acid pulse, 80 percent of salamandereggs hatched, but with it, only about one third hatched. He saidthe salamander population dropped from 500 to 200 during the study.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 20</NOTE></DOC>
