Profiles for Na{sup +}, Mg{sup2+}, DOC and other soluble species indicate that, at 16 years, contaminantshave migrated up to 130 cm from the waste. Profiles for conservativespecies suggest that Cl-, {sup 3}H, {sup 18}O and {sup 2}H fronts areahead of those species such as Na{sup +}, K{sup +} and DOC. In comparison,the heavy metals, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Pb, have migrated only 10-20 cm.Batch equilibrium studies involving Fe{sup 2+}, Cu{sup 2+}, Zn{sup 2+}and Pb{sup 2+} result in classical adsorption-pH curves which show increasingadsorption at higher pH levels and vice versa. The presence of soil carbonatesis shown to significantly increase the mass of Pb and Cu removed fromdomestic landfill leachate.</TEXT></DOC>
