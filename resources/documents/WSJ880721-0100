His view is in accord with the 1988 report of the Joint Economic Committee's Republican members.    The demand for the dollar is not for dollars per se, but for dollar-priced assets. Two notable exceptions, of course, are foreign deposits in U.S. banks and U.S. currency, which are demanded as monetary reserves for the Eurodollar payments system and the Third World's underground economy. If the outside world thinks dollar-priced assets are superior investments, the dollar will rise, and if they are inferior it will fall.    He touched on the &quot;hot money&quot; hypothesis that a rise in U.S. interest rates might actually bolster the dollar, but he failed to mention the flip side: Anticipation of an increase in U.S. interest rates would cause a slide in the stock and bond markets, and &quot;hot money&quot; would try to get out before it happened. The surge effect would be amplified by a decline in the dollar. Mr. Reynolds's point is that the bounce-back effect would bolster the dollar after interest rates had stabilized at new levels, and possibly even moderate their rise.    The Federal Reserve should not do anything to manipulate interest rates to affect exchange rates because it cannot control the expectations in world capital markets. Central planning always leads to perverse consequences in a free market.    Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho)   U.S. Senate   Washington   ---   My fellow supply-sider Alan Reynolds is right to be skeptical of conventional wisdom, but his seems based on a misunderstanding. Citing U.S. balance-of-payments statistics, he argues that foreign central banks acquired less than $50 billion in dollar assets during 1987, not more than $100 billion. He concludes that the rest of the financing for the $154 billion U.S. current account deficit must have come from private foreign investors, and that &quot;increased reserves of currencies other than the dollar are being counted as 'intervention in support of the dollar.'&quot;    But the discrepancy concerns actual dollar reserves. The June 1988 OECD Economic Outlook estimates that &quot;official dollar holdings may have increased by some $130 billion in 1987, and foreign-exchange holdings in other currencies (including ECUs) by around $70 billion, about one-half of which represented valuation effects.&quot; With the sale of $9 billion in foreign currencies by the U.S. Treasury, &quot;net official dollar purchases may be estimated at some $140 billion.&quot;    Most of the $80 billion-plus discrepancy probably will be traced to official Eurodollars -- such as dollar deposits in banks outside the U.S. The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development include Eurodollars in measuring dollar reserves held by central banks. But the U.S. statistics cited by Mr. Reynolds only pick up direct U.S. liabilities to foreign central banks. Official Eurodollars show up as investment by the private foreign institutions that act as intermediaries. The ultimate holders are foreign central banks, and official Eurodollars have the same effect on exchange markets as other dollar reserves.    In fact, the statistics imply that the whole net &quot;debtor&quot; position of the U.S. through 1987 (except for statistical discrepancies) was cumulatively financed through foreign central banks. As of year-end 1987, the U.S. net international investment position was $368 billion, and identified official dollar reserves (net of foreign exchange held by U.S.) were $360 billion.    My conclusion is different from either Mr. Reynolds or the conventional wisdom he questions. As I argued on the same page (&quot;The Reserve Currency Curse,&quot; Sept. 4, 1986), a chronic U.S. balance-of-payments deficit is an inherent side-effect of the dollar's official reserve-currency role. We must either learn to accept this as normal, or else change the system.    John Mueller   Economic Counsel to   Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.)    Washington   ---   Although Mr. Reynolds's article was thought-provoking, his attempt to equate official capital inflows with foreign-exchange intervention is seriously flawed. Although U.S. balance-of-payments statistics report only a $47.8 billion increase in foreign official assets in the U.S. last year, IMF and BIS data reveal that the amount of dollars held as international reserves rose by $130.5 billion.    These two figures are easily reconciled. Foreign central banks that intervened last year to support the dollar did not buy only U.S. government securities. Instead, a substantial portion of their growing dollar reserves was deposited in the Euromarket. These funds eventually flowed back to the U.S. through the banking system and were recorded as a private capital inflow. Nonetheless, it was the central banks, which had gone &quot;long&quot; in dollars by a further $130 billion, that bore the additional exchange-rate risk. It is in this sense that the bulk of last year's $154 billion current account deficit was &quot;financed&quot; by foreign-exchange intervention.    The inability of official capital inflows to measure foreign-exchange intervention is driven home by the 1988 data. U.S. balance-of-payments statistics report that foreign official assets in the U.S. grew at a $98 billion annual rate during the first quarter of this year. Under Mr. Reynolds's logic, this would imply massive foreign-exchange intervention to support the U.S. currency.    I doubt, however, that he would attribute the dollar's rebound in 1988 to foreign-exchange intervention. Neither would I. The limited increase in foreign-exchange reserves held by non-U.S. industrial countries during this period strongly suggests that the first-quarter surge in official purchases of U.S. government securities -- and the sharp drop in private banking inflows -- reflected a switch in central bank reserve holdings from Eurodollar (bank) deposits to U.S. Treasuries, not massive intervention to support the dollar.    While I share Mr. Reynolds's suspicion about the effectiveness of sterilized foreign-exchange intervention in stabilizing a currency, inappropriately equating official capital inflows with foreign-exchange intervention sheds no light on the matter. More important, this misuse of U.S. balance-of-payments data tells us nothing about whether the dollar's recent strength reflects the drop in U.S. tax rates -- which was fully anticipated -- or, more ominously, an interlude of mistaken confidence that the recent improvements in U.S. external performance will be sustained.
