<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-1033 </DOCNO><TEXT>Positioning the sampling orifice relatively far from the load coil combinedwith use of low forward power and high aerosol gas flow rate causes thebackground mass spectrum to become dominated by NO{sup +}. Nearly allthe Ar{sup +} and ArH{sup +} ions are suppressed under these conditions,which frees m/z 39 and 41 for potassium isotope ratio measurements. Theprecision is 0.3-0.9% relative standard deviation for potassium concentrationsin the range 1-50 mg L{sup -1}. The determined ratios are {similar_to}9% higher than the accepted value and also vary with the concentrationof sodium concomitant, so calibrations and chemical separations are desirable.These observations should permit use of inductively coupled plasma massspectrometry for rapid isotope ratio determinations of potassium frombiological organisms or water sources.</TEXT></DOC>
