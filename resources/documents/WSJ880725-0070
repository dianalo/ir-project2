Accompanied by his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Massachusetts governor drew the largest crowds of his campaign in a trip that took him from California's San Joaquin Valley to this Eastern industrial city. More than 8,000 people turned out at the state fairgrounds in Minot, N.D. To the now-familiar beat of the song &quot;Coming to America,&quot; he recreated the theatrics of the convention before a large ethnic audience in Modesto, Calif.    Along with the crowds came intensified reaction from the GOP, and Mr. Dukakis underlined his new status as the Democratic candidate in his long-distance parries with a key supporter of Vice President George Bush, President Reagan. In his weekly radio broadcast Saturday, Mr. Reagan accused the Democrats of hiding behind &quot;political trench coats and dark glasses&quot; and obscuring a vague platform in &quot;a plain brown wrapper.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis, calling Mr. Bush a &quot;scold&quot; and a &quot;nag,&quot; retorted, &quot;We'll send {Mr. Reagan} 50 position papers and 100 speeches.&quot; Each weekend stop was a small morality play to emphasize &quot;values&quot; and the campaign's new favorite, &quot;community.&quot; He declared, &quot;Balancing your budget, paying your bills, obeying the law are basic values.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis preached party unity in Houston's Tranquility Park. And with one of his former rivals, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, the governor went to a St. Louis Baptist church, where Mr. Gephardt welcomed him as &quot;someone who is at home with us.&quot;    In between was much flag waving and ethnic bonding that seemed contagious. Priscilla Cox, 66 years old, is Jewish and hails originally from Chicago. But at the Dukakis rally in Modesto her handwritten sign read &quot;Arriba el Duque.&quot; &quot;He speaks Spanish, I taught Spanish,&quot; said the retired school teacher. &quot;Why not?&quot;    The son-of-immigrants theme so emphasized by the campaign is calculated to stir not only voters but the candidate himself. &quot;He doesn't work unless he feels good,&quot; says the governor's friend and campaign chairman, Paul Brountas. It is as if Mr. Dukakis's managers have learned that a few bars of &quot;Coming to America&quot; are the tonic that can break the candidate's reserve. Just as Mr. Reagan has often played a John Wayne, Mr. Dukakis seeks to present not only the competent manager but the ethnic father, stern in his frugality and respect for the law, but also a caring provider who ensures equal opportunity for all his children.    The Democratic nominee got good news when a poll by Newsweek magazine taken Thursday and Friday showed him with a commanding 55% to 38% lead over Mr. Bush. But it was expected that Mr. Dukakis would benefit from a good convention, and the vice president has a chance to do the same at the GOP convention next month.    Even earlier, however -- on the day after the convention -- Democratic optimism was illustrated by Sen. David Boren. His home state of Oklahoma gave Ronald Reagan almost 70% of its votes in 1984 and the conservative lawmaker has spent most of his career running away from the national ticket. Not this year, he says. &quot;I'm going to do everything I can to help Dukakis-Bentsen in my state,&quot; he declares, adding, &quot;I guarantee you we're going to carry Oklahoma.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis spoke in Greek, Portuguese, and Spanish, and Sen. Bentsen emphasized the governor's themes: &quot;He's talking about jobs, he's talking about child care . . . and he's talking about education.&quot; Little was said of foreign policy -- where the running mates have sizable differences. Less still was said of Rev. Jackson.    At a meeting in Atlanta Friday with his delegates, the minister gave Mr. Dukakis a warm send-off. But the governor's aides are carefully scripting the show of unity to maintain some distance for the governor. And the weekend trip allowed the running mates to claim the spotlight, away from Mr. Jackson and before largely white and Hispanic voters.    But Mr. Jackson's own national chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, also displayed the shift. &quot;This is now the ticket,&quot; he said in an interview before introducing Sen. Bentsen at a private gathering of Democrats in Stockton, Calif. &quot;There is no more Jackson organization. It is a Democratic organization.&quot; He described Mr. Bentsen as an &quot;old friend&quot; and said he never was as close personally to Mr. Jackson as he is to fellow Californians allied with Mr. Dukakis.    However, there will be some substantive concessions made to Mr. Jackson's campaign; this week Hazel Obey, a top Jackson aide, is likely to be tapped as one of two political directors for the crucial Dukakis campaign in Texas.    Both Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Bush are popular figures there, making the state a battlefield unto itself. November will force Texans to make a choice many would prefer to avoid. &quot;This will cause more hard feelings in {the Houston suburb of} River Oaks than stealing someone else's maid,&quot; jokes Rep. Charles Wilson (D., Texas). &quot;Bentsen will draw the line in the dust like Travis at the Alamo.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
