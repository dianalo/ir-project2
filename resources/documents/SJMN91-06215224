RETURNS FIRE, SUES COUNTY OVER REDEVELOPMENTPACT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Nick Anderson contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In good financial times, the agreement could direct up to $5 millionannually from the redevelopment agency into the county's strapped coffers.;   The flurry of legal jabs also appears to signify a deteriorating relationshipbetween rookie Mayor Susan Hammer and her county counterparts across the civiccenter parking lot.;    Thursday's action is the city's response to a July 11lawsuit by the county, which is trying to block the sale of up to $80 millionin redevelopment bonds that would pump money into downtown stores, hotels, thearena and a hoped-for major league baseball stadium.;    County wasn'tconvinced;  The suit was filed after Hammer failed to convince CountyExecutive Sally Reed and the board of supervisors that the redevelopmentagency would find a way to give some money back to the county.;    Now, thecity suit contends, the county has adopted a &quot;stonewall position . . . solelyfor the purpose of forcing the city and the agency to increase the size oftheir payments to the county.&quot;;    In addition, the county complaint may makethe bond sale &quot;impractical or impossible&quot; and will certainly place expensiverestrictions on any bonds the city could sell, the city contends. As a result,redevelopment construction will be delayed while legal fees and other costsrise, the city says.;    City Attorney Joan Gallo, who wants the case moved toanother county, said the 1983 agreement specifically forbids the county fromsuing the redevelopment agency over expansion plans.;    But Reed, whopersuaded four of the five county supervisors to approve the suit in aclosed-door session last month, says the county had no choice. She said thecity council approved the bond sale in June without giving the county a chanceto argue for a share of the estimated $24 million annually that the countywill lose in property taxes if the bonds are sold.;    Revenue would be lostin 2016;  The impact of the sale would not actually be felt by the countyuntil 2016 because the new bonds simply extend the life of the redevelopmentagency -- and its ability to collect a share of property taxes that normallywould go to the county.;    Hammer has argued that the bond sales would helpboth the city and the county, but she cut off negotiations when the suit wasfiled. The mayor is out of town this week, but her chief budget aide, BobBrownstein, called the county suit &quot;an extraordinarily bad error in judgment&quot;because it blocks the bonds and ruins the county's hopes of winning newsubsidies from the redevelopment agency.;    &quot;When somebody sues you, youcan't simply yield,&quot; Brownstein said.;    Meanwhile, Reed, who said she hadhoped to continue negotiating with the agency despite the county suit, calledthe city's action &quot;an extraordinary step.&quot;;    &quot;I think it shows a lack ofrespect for county residents and the services they need,&quot; Reed said. &quot;Theydon't just need a downtown. They need hospitals, mental health systems and alaw and justice system that works.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MALINE HAZLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  584  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215224,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
