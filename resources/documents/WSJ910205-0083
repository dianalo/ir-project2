If so, Europe and Japan willcontinue to enjoy that advantage: The Treasury Department isnot going to propose a universal banking model for the U.S.And it's well that it won't, because universal banking posessignificant risks for our deposit insurance system andeventually for taxpayers.   In a system of universal banking, as practiced in Germanyand perhaps eventually throughout Europe, banks are permitteddirectly to take unlimited equity positions in othercompanies. Japanese banks are allowed only 5% equity stakes.   The Treasury's plan, in contrast, is likely to permitbanks only to be affiliated with or owned by nonbanking(including commercial) concerns. Banks would be prohibitedfrom directly engaging in any other nonbanking activity. Thisseemingly technical distinction between affiliation anddirect activity is critically important. Indeed, itunderscores the major drawback to the universal bankingmodel.   Universal banking would stretch the federal safety net --deposit insurance and access to the Fed's discount window --under not just banks but much of the rest of the economy aswell. Although no one there may admit it, this has alreadyhappened in both Germany and Japan, where it is widelyunderstood that the central banks would never permitdepositors at any large bank to take a loss. America, too,has its &quot;too big to fail&quot; policy-witness the recentprotection of all depositors of the Bank of New England --but at least it doesn't (yet) apply to bank investments inthe auto, steel and computer industries.   Of course, advocates of universal banking might answer bysaying, get rid of &quot;too big to fail.&quot; That way, when a largebank is threatened by losses in its securities, insurance orcommercial business, the deposit insurer won't bear the wholeloss. Indeed, there is growing support in Congress even amongthose who don't like universal banking for ending &quot;too big tofail.&quot;   But this is not realistic. Even if Congress were torestrict or prevent the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fromfully protecting uninsured depositors, the Federal Reservewould still come to their rescue by providing sufficientliquidity to troubled banks to meet any run.   Advocates of universal banking might reply instead thatbecause universal banks should be safer than ordinary banks,the FDIC and the Fed would be less likely to be called uponthan now. Critics will scoff, and point to the claims in theearly 1980s that &quot;broader powers&quot; would save the thriftindustry.   The problems with universal banking run even deeper,however. Because their deposits are insured by the federalgovernment, banks are able to raise funds more cheaply thanother companies. If the law were to allow banks to engagedirectly in other activities (rather than through affiliatesfinanced by uninsured funds), then bank-operated financialand commercial enterprises would have an advantage overindependently operated (that is, nonbank owned) companies.Accordingly, the market would eventually drive companies intothe arms of commercial banks.   Universal banking advocates, of course, see nothing wrongin this; to the contrary, they believe that bank-controlledcapitalism is better than the current stock market controlledsystem. But even if that theory is correct in Germany andJapan, where commercial banks historically have attracted thecream of managerial talent, it is questionable at best forthe U.S., where the best talent has flowed into other sectorsof the economy. To be sure, the best and the brightest of ourmanagers might begin moving into banks if universal bankingwere to become the norm, but the transition period would belong -- certainly long enough for many banks to make moremistakes at the FDIC's expense.   If the universal banking model contains such risks, isTreasury's likely model of bank &quot;affiliation&quot; with nonbanks(under the roof of a common holding company) any better? Inprinciple, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; because the plan would notpermit banks directly to fund other businesses with insureddeposits. But even this approach is hardly risk-free.   Without off-setting measures, commercial conglomerates canuse insured bank deposits to subsidize loans to customers oftheir nonbanking operations. After all, wouldn't GM or Fordrather extend cut-rate car loans through an affiliated bankfunded with insured deposits than through their financecompanies funded with uninsured commercial paper? Inaddition, conglomerates would have incentives to use insureddeposits to pay for common overhead costs.   More troubling, even though a bank may be healthy, thefailure of the nonbanking arm of a bank could easily triggera run among the bank's depositors. To be sure, such runs areirrational. But so were the runs by insured depositors on theBank of New England.   Three methods have been advanced for insulating banks fromtheir nonbank affiliates. So far, the option that appears tobe preferred in Congress (among those at least willing tocontemplate financial modernization) is to raise even higher&quot;firewalls&quot; than those that Treasury probably will propose:that banks and their affiliates be required to maintainseparate employees, officers, directors, places of businessand names. John Dingell, the chairman of the key House Energyand Commerce Committee has insisted in the past that banksand their affiliates be prohibited from &quot;cross-marketing&quot;their services. With such firewalls, no one from outside thebanking industry will be interested in getting in.   A second option, advanced at least once by FDIC ChairmanWilliam Seidman, would order banks to narrow theirinvestments (over some reasonable transition period) to &quot;safeassets&quot; -- government securities and highly-rated corporate,municipal and asset-backed instruments -- as the price foraffiliating with other enterprises. Banks in suchconglomerates would have to transfer their direct lendingbusiness to separate finance company affiliates, funded byuninsured sources. As a carrot for limiting their investmentsto safe assets, conglomerate banks could be charged lowerdeposit insurance premiums than other nonaffiliated banks(with broader investment powers) while being permitted toabide by lower capital requirements.   Finally, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (andconceivably the Treasury plan itself) proposes that banksdesiring to belong to financial or commercial conglomeratesmaintain higher capital ratios than other banks. Thisproposal could have the opposite effect of the &quot;narrow&quot; or&quot;safe&quot; banking option: To meet return-on-equity targets,banks owned by conglomerates might shift their portfolios toeven riskier assets. On the other hand, a higher capitalthreshold might deter nonbanks from entering banking lessthan strict investment limits would.   It will be said, of course, that imposing either highercapital requirements or narrow banking will scare off justthose commercial giants whose interest in banking andwillingness to supply capital are so sorely needed. There isno easy way to resolve this tradeoff. Some believe that thecost savings to the FDIC and to consumers from one-stopshopping justify the gamble on less intrusive insulationrequirements. Others (like me) are less willing to riskstretching the federal safety net, and so want strongerinsulation.   The scars of the Sandamp;L debacle are so painfully felt inCongress that it is unlikely that banks will be permitted toaffiliate with nonbanks, even with substantial insulationprovisions. Congressional inaction, however, will not end thedebate. During the 1980s, various states have effectivelyendorsed the universal banking model by allowing the banksthey charter to expand their product offerings. If Congresscontinues to sit on its hands, this trend should continueinto the 1990s.   So those in Congress and the country who wish to preventthe federal safety net from overstretch would be wise to facethe question now.   ---   Mr. Litan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, recentlyco-authored a report on the banking industry for theFinancial Institutions Subcommittee of the House BankingCommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
