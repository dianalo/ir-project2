A three-judge 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Fridayunanimously upheld a ruling by a U.S. district judge in Clevelandbarring the state from enforcing the 1986 law.   It required that doctors performing abortions on unmarried womenyounger than 18 must notify the women's parents.   On Monday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louisupheld a similar law in Minnesota. That law requires minors seekingabortions to notify both parents or get judicial permission 48hours before the procedure.   Linda Sogg, a Cleveland lawyer who argued against the Ohio law,praised Friday's ruling.   ``It is a victory for all the parents who have wonderfulrelationships with their children who don't need laws to havecommunication,'' Ms. Sogg said. ``I also think it is aconstitutional victory of some great importance for young women,for the privacy of their bodies, and for adult women and theirbodies.''   Roger Evans, a lawyer with the Planned Parenthood Federation ofAmerica in New York City, also hailed the ruling.   ``We're glad that the court has upheld the rights of minor womento have constitutionally guaranteed services without imposing undueburdens,'' Evans said.   The appeals court cited the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973decision that a woman has a fundamental constitutional right toseek an abortion.   U.S. District Judge Ann Aldrich had found that portions of theOhio law were either unconstitutionally vague or infringed on theconstitutional rights of females younger than 18. The judgeobjected to a specific requirement that the doctor must be the oneto notify parents. She said this placed an unfair burden on a youngwoman's right of access to an abortion.   The judge also ruled that the Ohio law fails to adequatelyprotect a minor woman's right to confidentiality. In addition, Ms.Aldrich concluded that the law unfairly requires a minor who seekscourt approval to have an abortion without parental notification toprove that she is sufficiently mature to make her own decision toundergo the procedure.   Lawyers for the state had argued that the law is constitutionaland appealed to the 6th Circuit for permission to enforce it.   Rita Eppler, an assistant Ohio attorney general who argued thecase for the state, declined to comment Friday on the appealscourt's ruling until she sees it. She refused to say if the statewould appeal further.   The case began when the Akron Center for Reproductive Health,two minor women and Dr. Max Pierre Gaujean, who performs abortionsat the Akron center, filed suit to block enforcement of the law.</TEXT></DOC>
