Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Swifter justice may be on the way in California.    The state Supreme Court, responding to a huge and nagging backlog of unresolved cases, adopted a rule that will require it to issue final opinions within 90 days of the date that a case is argued or finally briefed.    The decision settles a lawsuit by a disgruntled attorney who had to wait nearly three years to get one of his cases resolved. In effect, the court is subjecting itself to a provision of the state constitution that withholds paychecks for judges who fail to deliver decisions within three months after cases are heard.    Malcolm Lucas, the chief justice, and observers of the court said the new policy would improve public confidence in the overloaded court by adding some predictability to its decision-making. But others said the rule could reduce the quality of opinions and also fails to address some major reasons behind the currently crowded docket.    The new restriction, effective Jan. 1, will limit the court to about half the time a case now takes to resolve. Several closely followed cases, including a potentially far-reaching ruling involving the rights of terminated employees, have been pending before the court for more than a year.    &quot;It is a valiant effort, but an unfortunate one to have to take,&quot; said Stephen Barnett, professor at the University of California School of Law in Berkeley.    Mr. Barnett said the new time restraint could discourage the writing of dissenting opinions and also limit the ability of attorneys to influence the court's thinking through oral argument. He also said the new rule might not necessarily result in speedier justice, depending upon how much time the court takes reviewing cases before actually setting hearing dates.    The entire California court system has been more than brimming with cases for years. Concern has been compounded at the supreme court level since the appointment of a new conservative majority early last year. One major reason is that the new high court has been affirming an especially large number of death-penalty sentences, decisions which are unusually lengthy and time-consuming. As of August, the court had 388 cases pending, including 182 death-penalty cases.    According to Gerald Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara University School of Law, the court decided a record number of death-penalty cases during its first 18 months together. But its backlog of such cases actually increased because of new cases being filed, according to Mr. Uelmen.    The court has tried to cope with the issue by accepting fewer cases for review, especially in the civil-law area. But that policy has also angered some attorneys and judges who contend that the court is sidestepping important questions of law. The subject is being considered at the annual state bar convention this weekend at a seminar entitled: &quot;Has the California Supreme Court Been Sentenced to Death?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
