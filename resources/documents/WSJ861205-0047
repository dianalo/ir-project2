The proposal -- to be filed with federal Judge Harold Greene, who oversees the divestiture accord -- also will call for the Federal Communications Commission to take over the Justice Department's role, according to FCC officials and the regional Bell telephone concerns.    Currently, the Justice Department advises Judge Greene, who must approve waivers requested by the seven Bell operating companies to enter new businesses. Under the ATandamp;T proposal, the FCC would take on the new role of helping to determine new areas of telecommunications competition. The federal regulatory agency, under Chairman Mark Fowler, has vigorously advocated quicker deregulation, a goal that the regional Bell companies also have aggressively pursued in Washington. They especially have sought to end the prohibition barring them from manufacturing products and providing long-distance service.    &quot;ATandamp;T has been looking into ways the waiver process could be streamlined,&quot; said an ATandamp;T spokeswoman in Washington. &quot;It is possible we may file something next week regarding streamlining the waiver review process.&quot; She declined to elaborate.    But Bell Atlantic Corp. lambasted the proposal as &quot;an obvious attempt by ATandamp;T to protect its monopoly position in manufacturing and long distance.&quot; Because the FCC is bound by complex procedural rules, it might take many months for the agency to make a recommendation to Judge Greene, said the Philadelphia-based concern. Under the plan, Judge Greene then would have make a final decision, which would take even more time.    ATandamp;T's plan thus would represent &quot;additional procedural obstacles that will delay true competition in telecommunications,&quot; Bell Atlantic contended.    If approved, the proposal could raise troublesome questions about what procedures the FCC should follow and whether Judge Greene would, in effect, be overseeing the agency. &quot;We are looking at some of the procedural complexities&quot; that would be posed by the plan, said an FCC official.    The ATandamp;T proposal would come at a critical time in the industry. Telecommunications players anxiously are awaiting a report commissioned by the Justice Department on changes in the industry's level of competition since divestiture.    Based on the report, which was prepared by consultant Peter Huber, the Justice Department will make recommendations to Judge Greene next month on whether the regional Bell concerns should be permitted to enter manufacturing and long-distance markets and to provide certain computer services. </TEXT></DOC>
