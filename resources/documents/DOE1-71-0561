The probable nuclear generating capacityis estimated for 1986-2000. Previous capacity forecasts (1981-1986) arecompared with actual generating capacity. When looking at demand, a distinctionhas to be made between what reactor operators require to fuel reactors(reactor requirements) and what they intend to purchase (uranium procurements).This distinction is defined and discussed. The interaction between supplyand demand is shown and factors affecting trade (eg government policies)are discussed. 1985 was the first year when uranium production was lessthan reactor requirements. This shortfall will continue for a numberof years with the current excess in consumer inventories supplying thedifference between reactor requirements and uranium procurements. Uraniumdemand should exceed production by 1988 but additional capacity shouldbe available from planned and possible restart and possible new facilities.(U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
