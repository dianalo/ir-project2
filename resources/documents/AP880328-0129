Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,the chief sponsors of the union-sought legislation, mustered only41 of the 60 votes needed to end debate and force a vote on themeasure itself.   The bill is aimed at addressing what the National Institute ofOccupational Safety and Health estimates is one in every fourAmericans who has been exposed to carcinogens at work, most of themunaware of it.   ``This bill is about people getting cancer in the workplace andlearning about it too late to do anything about it,'' Metzenbaumsaid. ``The American Cancer Society estimates we can save 250,000lives in the next 10 years by implementing it.''   A fourth and possibly final attempt at ending the filibuster isscheduled Tuesday. Supporters of the bill believe if they getanother 14 or 15 votes then, they can prevent Senate MajorityLeader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., from giving up on the effort to winits passage this year.   A virtually identical measure was passed by the House on a225-186 vote last November. Administration officials have said theywould urge President Reagan to veto if it reaches his desk.   Although the filibuster primarily is the work of RepublicanSens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Dan Quayle of Indiana, a small groupof southern Democrats who want to avoid a showdown vote are helpingkeep it alive.   Metzenbaum and Kennedy were able to get just 33 votes last weekfor ending the filibuster. At least one southern Democrat and a fewliberal Republicans who had voted with Hatch and Quayle last weekvoted with Metzenbaum and Kennedy on Monday.   The bill would establish a panel of seven scientific experts toidentify the most hazardous substances in workplaces and the groupsof employees most susceptible to disabling diseases because ofexposure to them.   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health wouldbe required to notify between 100,000 and 300,000 of those workersevery year at an annual cost of $25 million. Employers then wouldbe required to finance medical monitoring programs for them at acost of up to $250 each annually.   If a physician recommends transferring a monitored employee toless hazardous work, he or she would have to be paid the same levelof wages and benefits to them in the new job. If no other job isavailable, the employee is entitled to full wages for up to a yearafter leaving work.   In addition to unions, the bill is supported by public healthgroups, the chemical and electronic industries and several majorcompanies, most of which have instituted such notification programson their own.   However, it is opposed by small businesses and large tradeassociations such as the National Association of Manufacturers andthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which claim the bill would exposecompanies to liability suits from current and former employees.   ``If this bill passes, there is going to be a liability crisisin this country like we've never seen before,'' Hatch said.``You're going to have billions and billions of dollars inlawsuits.''</TEXT></DOC>
