(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fort Howard Corp.'s decision to goprivate in a management-led $3.57 billion leveraged buyout couldspark a bidding war led by foreign investors, according to analysts.   The agreement unveiled Monday calls for a cash offer of $53 pershare, starting July 1, for all 67.4 million outstanding commonshares of the giant 69-year-old manufacturer of disposable paper,plastic and foam products.   Fort Howard stock jumped $3.87{ to $53.87{ a share in heavytrading on the New York Stock Exchange, following a $2.50 a sharerise on Friday when Fort Howard announced it was negotiating for aleveraged buy-out.   The company said the merger was recommended unanimously by aspecial committee of Fort Howard's outside directors, which nowwill make itself available to receive inquiries from any otherparties interested in acquiring the company.   ``One could certainly interpret that they have left the dooropen for other bidders to come through should they see fit to doso,'' said Hugh F. Denison, director of research at The MilwaukeeCompany. ``I wouldn't be surprised if somebody does.''   But Denison suggested it would take Japanese or other foreignbuyers looking at the long-term worth of the company to offer morethan $53 a share.   ``My guess would be that if somebody new comes into the picture,they would apt to be from a foreign land,'' he said.   ``It's possible that another bidder might come forward,'' saidRudolph A. Hokanson, of the firm Blunt Ellis andamp; Loewi, in Milwaukee.``I have no idea who that could be, but it would have to be someonewho is well financed and who will have to act quickly.''   The board of directors stated it had signed a definitive mergeragreement with three top Fort Howard executives and the MorganStanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, an East Coast limited partnershipformed late last year.   The Fort Howard executives are Paul J. Schierl, the chairman andchief executive officer, president Donald H. DeMeuse and KathleenJ. Hempel, first vice president.   ``This change in ownership from a public to a privately-heldcorporation is in the best interests of shareholders, employees,customers and the company communities in which we haveoperations,'' Schierl said.   ``As a private company, we can continue to provide excellent joband career opportunities for our 16,000 employees while maintainingour commitments to the many communities that depend on FortHoward.''   Schierl said Fort Howard had the financial resources necessaryto serviecs the debt it would incur under the buyout. In aleveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed fundsthat are repaid with money raised by asset sales or cash flow.   The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II and Morgan StanleyGroup Inc. plan to provide approximately $1.53 billion in temporaryfinancing for acquisitions and equity. The so-called bridgefinancing is expected to be repaid through a public or privateoffering of long-term debt.   The equity fund has received commitments of more than $1.6billion from investors, including pension funds and financialinstitutions.   Also subject to certain conditions, Bankers Trust is to lead asyndicate of banks in providing up to $2.55 billion in primaryfinancing, of which Bankers Trust will provide $500 million.   ``Fort Howard is a fine company, with a strong record ofperformance,'' Tom Saunders, chairman of equity fund, said. ``Webelieve Fort Howard has excellent prospects and we are pleased tobe associated with them.''   Fort Howard's product line includes bath and facial tissues,napkins and industrial wipers, paper and plastic cupss, lids,plates, sandwich containers, food packages, straws and ice creamcones.   Fort Howard, founded in Green Bay in 1919, reported 1987 salesof $1.8 billion and net earnings of $157.7 million. It went publicin 1970.
