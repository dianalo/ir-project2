(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of Hampshire College deniedagreeing to the demands of students who took over an office toprotest alleged indifference to racial issues, while black studentsat MIT submitted a list of demands to officials there.   About 50 black graduate students at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology in Cambridge surprised President Paul Gray onThursday with the list at an informal regular session held by theschool's head.   Among the demands were calls for regular meetings between campusminority groups and administrators and for a statement condemningracist graffiti that appeared near the black graduate studentlounge more than a year ago.   In western Massachusetts, meanwhile, more talks were scheduledtoday between Hampshire College President Adele Simmons andrepresentatives of black, Hispanic, Inian and other minoritystudents holding a dormitory office.   An estimated 40 students took over the Dakin House officeTuesday to protest what they alleged to be the administration'sindifference to their concerns. Their demands included the hiringof a racial harassment officer and a policy statement condemningracism.   Spokesmen for the protesters described Thursday's talks as``active'' but said no decisions were made in the meeting.   ``The administration has agreed in principle. However, furthernegotiations are necessary before we are satisfied,'' according toa statement read by student Sydney Deberry, 19.   Simmons denied agreeing to the students' demands, but said theywere justified in feeling frustrated. ``They are right insuggesting we need to move their concerns higher up in ourpriorities,'' the president said.   She said some of the demands, such as a call for a policy onracial harassment, have been in the works for several months. ``Thetimetable will be moved up a bit because of this,'' she said.   In Cambridge, the MIT students also demanded that Gray apologizefor his ``self-admitted inadequate performance'' in minorityrecruitment and appoint a black vice president.   ``When will we get a formal apology from you for admitting yourfailures?'' asked Ron Francis, co-chairman of the Black GraduateStudent Association.   Gray responded: ``I didn't come here to be harassed.''   The president acknowledged, however, that ``MIT needs to take agreater part in enabling pluralism. ... I'm not satisifed in themeasured levels of black undergrads here nor am I satisfied in themeasured levels of black faculty here.''   He agreed to meet with a smaller group in two to three weeks todiscuss the demands.   Earlier this month, students occupied a building at theUniversity of Massachusetts for six days to protest racial violenceat that campus. The occupation ended Feb. 17 when Chancellor JosephD. Duffey reached agreeement with protesters on such demands asincreased resources for Third World programs.</TEXT></DOC>
