 Most programmers find itdrudgery and most project managers worry that their programmers are nottesting applications thoroughly enough.andP;  The project managers are oftenright: testing is usually less rigorous and reliable than it should be.andM;Recendy, however, I've been trying out a software product that could makeboth programmers and project managers a lot happier about testing.andP;  SterlingSoftware's TestPro is a PC-based system for developing, executing andmaintaining test libraries.andP;  It can be used to test applications that areprogrammed in any language for execution on a mainframe or PC.andM;The TestPro package has three components: the Recorder, the Outliner and aset of utilities.andM;The concept behind the Recorder is simple.andP;  It works like a tape recorder.andO;When you call up the Recorder, it even paints the screen with a strip thatlooks like a tape.andP;  You can select &quot;record&quot; and then record or capture thekeystrokes that you make.andP;  When you have finished the set of keystrokes (thetest's script), you can &quot;position the tape head&quot; back to the beginning of thetape by hitting the home key You can then select &quot;play&quot; to execute thekeystrokes that you just entered.andP;  If you have ever operated a tape recorderor VCR, you will find the use of the Recorder intuitive.andM;TestPro allows you to develop your testing scripts while you are executing(and developing) the target application.andP;  For example, you could ask theRecorder to record the keystrokes that you make to log on to the mainframe,select an application, enter values, and so forth.andP;  At certain points in theexecution of the target application, you could toggle back to the Recorderand insert commands to have TestPro automatically evaluate the currentoutput.andM;The Outliner portion of TestPro is a planning tool.andP;  It lets you control anddocument the execution sequence for the test scripts you prepared with theRecorder.andP;  I was impressed by the way in which I could develop my test planwith the Outliner in tandem with developing scripts in the Recorder.andM;I filled in the plan with plain English instructions that explained what wasgoing to happen in the test script.andP;  After I completed an Englishinstruction, then the fun started.andP;  I entered the name of the tape andoptionally the label for the point in the tape where the instruction's scriptwas to reside.andP;  A set of keys brought up the Recorder.andP;  I could then eitherenter a new test script, or else edit or play back an existing one.andM;Pointers to this script then became part of my test plan.andP;  I toggled back andforth between the Outliner and Recorder to enter the rest of the plan's stepsuntil I had a complete test plan.andM;The instructions in my test plan looked look like this:andM;&quot;Log on to the payroll system/Compute payroll/Display payroll calculationsand capture screen/Log off the payroll system.&quot;andM;Each line in the plan had a corresponding script that would be run in thespecified sequence under control of the Outliner.andM;The scripts you record can include other things besides your keystrokes.andP;  Inthe example above, when I wanted to capture a screen I selected the &quot;display&quot;option within the Recorder, then from the menu displayed, chose &quot;capture&quot; tocapture a screen of data displayed at that point in the execution of thetest.andM;I could have asked TestPro to automatically compare this screen with abenchmark screen using one of the Testpro utilities: the Match utility.andP;  Thebenchmark screen itself could have been created either from scratch by ascreen design facility, or from a captured screen of data.andM;TestPro leaves little room for human error.andP;  I am sure that I have completelymissed erroneous data on test output screens before, but with the Matchutility mistakes would be hard to skip.andP;  Testpro highlights the discrepanciesbetween the benchmark and the actual output.andP;  If you have a color monitor,you can specify the color that TestPro will use to block the fields in error.andM;One of the best uses of TestPro for many systems shops will be for regressiontesting.andP;  A library of tests can be maintained, edited as needed, then re-runagainst applications that have been enhanced.andM;The technology underlying the testing package was first introduced bySterling in 1987.andP;  Since then, the company has refined the product andstarted marketing it under the TestPro name in 1990.andP;  To its credit, SterlingSoftware, which sells the Mark series of programming languages, uses TestProto test its own software products and enhancements before they are released.andM;I have one caution for new TestPro users.andP;  You need to be careful when youare within the Outliner or Recorder that the testing files you need are inyour current DOS path.andP;  A Sterling representative whom I spoke to, however,says that this problem has been resolved in release 4.0.andM;Release 4.0, which is to be available shortly, will also provide mousesupport to allow users to capture and play back mouse movements.andM;TestPro release 3.1 requires an IBM PC XT, AT, PS/2 or 100 per centcompatible, 200K of conventional memory and a hard disk drive.andP;  If the targetapplication being tested is on a host, it can be tested at the PC with anumber of terminal emulators.andM;Individual copies range in price from $2,100 to $5,600 per copy depending onvolume.andP;  LAN pricing, and corporate and site licensing are also available.andO;In addition, Sterling has packaged two introductory offers consisting ofmultiple copies of TestPro, along with educational and implementationassistance.andM;If you think the testing stage may be a weak link in your project developmentlife cycle, TestPro is well worth a close look.andM;Beverly Biderman is an applications planning analyst with the Division ofComputing and Communications at the University of Toronto.andP;  The viewsexpressed in this article are her personal views, and are not necessarilythose of her employer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
