The experimental uncertainties were within 5%. Their interfacialtension isotherms show apparent negative deviation from the linear dependenceon salt composition. It was found that the LiF-KF binary melt showednearly ideal solution behavior in the interfacial tension as well asin the surface tension. On the other hand, the formation of the complexion BeF/sub 4//sup 2-/ would play an important role in the interfacialtension of the LiF-BeF/sub 2/ binary melt-liquid bismuth system in thesame way as in the surface tension.</TEXT></DOC>
