(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Janet MasonandM;Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, with their mission ofautomating software development, present a paradox to corporateinformation-systems departments.andM;Common sense might indicate that the computer department would be the easiestto automate.andP;  In fact, the opposite is true.andP;  Not only is theinformation-systems department typically one of the last to be automated, itis also one of the most difficult.andM;The CASE market is one of vague definitions and a lack of standards.andP;  CASEoften requires major adjustments -- such as using an unaccustomed methodology-- by the people using the tools.andM;Despite CASE's drawbacks, in this era of massive software backlogs and anever-widening gap between technically advanced hardware and overmatchedsoftware, business cannot afford to overlook CASE.andM;About 20 percent of the corporate market has purchased CASE tools, accordingto Vaughan Merlyn, chairman of CASE Research Corp., based in Bellevue, Wash.andO;Those who are using the technology correctly report ''tremendous successstories,'' he said.andM;The CASE market is divided into two primary categories: front-end CASE, whichautomates the analysis and design portion of software development; andback-end CASE, which consists of automatic code-generation tools.andM;Before the advent of PC-based tools, CASE referred to mainframe-based codegenerators.andM;''When the PC-based design and analysis tools started appearing several yearsago with their sexy graphics,'' said Merlyn, ''people started experimentingwith the tools and calling them CASE.''andM;An increasing number of code generators are now being designed to run on themore affordable PC, thereby amplifying the definition of CASE to include bothfront and back ends.andM;Front-end CASE users and vendors agree that better communication with usersis the primary benefit of automating the design and analysis process.andM;''Studies have shown that [software] maintenance problems develop early inthe analysis and design phase,'' said John Daly, director of marketing forIndex Technology Corp., of Cambridge, Mass., ''because the analyst hasn'tproperly dealt with the end users' needs.''andM;Curt Corder, who uses Index's Excelerator/IS product, also thinks that amajor advantage lies in improved user communication.andM;''Pictures are worth a thousand words,'' said Corder, coordinator ofoperations systems and data administration with Northwest Natural Gas, inPortland, Ore.andP;  He added that the tool's graphical representations of datamodels and flow diagrams aid communication between analysts and users.andM;Another benefit of front-end CASE tools is the automatic recording of systemdocumentation.andP;  The system specifications, which are later used forprogramming code, are stored either in the PC-based front-end tool or, withintegrated products, in a mainframe repository.andM;But according to Jerry Grochow, vice president of the corporate technologygroup at American Management Systems Inc., a computer-consulting firm basedin Arlington, Va., ''Excelerator and other CASE tools have a ways to go inimproving their document design.''andM;Grochow deals with a variety of CASE tools.andP;  ''It takes a lot of work to getthe [system] documentation into a usable form,'' he said, ''so a lot ofpeople resort to using CASE tools with a desktop-publishing system.''andM;Exceptions to the RuleandM;Most front-end CASE tools are designed to create mainframe applications.andO;There are, however, a few exceptions.andP;  Microstep, from Syscorp InternationalInc. of Austin, Texas, is part of a growing trend of CASE products intendedfor custom PC software development.andM;While the product can be used to analyze mainframe applications, said MarkFlanigan, Syscorp's marketing manager, the product incorporates a codegenerator that generates C code for PC applications.andM;PC-based CASE tools that generate applications for the PC are a good way forcompanies to justify the cost of using CASE before moving onto larger,mainframe projects, said Flanigan.andM;One aspect of front-end CASE tools -- positive or negative, depending on whois making the judgment -- is that they force systems analysts into using astandardized methodology.andP;  The key to a successful CASE endeavor, saidMerlyn, is having a systems strategy for the whole company.andP;  To do this, headded, ''IS as an industry has to mature from the crafting of software to asystems-engineering environment.''andM;Despite the problems, many CASE vendors are working with the users to providea flexible set of analysis methodologies.andP;  ''[CASE] tools are more equal [infeatures] today than they were a few years ago,'' said American ManagementSystems' Grochow.andP;  ''Almost all of them offer Yourdon/DeMarco, and some havea choice of other methodologies such as Bachman and  Chen.''andM;''People have a right to resist the straight-jacket approach to analysismethodologies,'' said Index Technology's Daly, because innovation requirescreative and flexible approaches.andP;  Excelerator/ IS provides Yourdon/DeMarcomethods, and another product from Index Technology, called the Customizer,provides other data-flow diagrams.andM;Other companies offer companion products to customize methodologies.andP;  Forinstance, CADware Inc., in New Haven, Conn., produces Foundry to adapt itsCASE tools to various methodologies.andM;Some companies, such as Syscorp, provide a methodology they consider easy tolearn.andM;''Microstep's diagramming techniques are based on the methodology of EdYourdon and Peter Chen,'' said Syscorp's Flanigan.andP;  ''We use graphical iconswith the program, such as a picture that looks like a report, which peoplerelate to well.''andM;Back-end code-generating CASE products are relatively new to the PC arena.andO;Sage Software Inc., in Rockville, Md., introduced its PC-based code generatorAPS/PC last summer.andP;  ''Now it runs on the PC with the same power as it did onthe mainframe,'' said Grochow.andM;The advantage of using a PC-based code generator over a mainframe tool, saidGrochow, is that the user ''doesn't have to worry about mainframe access.''andO;He estimates that the mainframe environment in his company costs $3,000 perprogrammer on a monthly basis.andM;But Robert Dunn, president and CEO of CADware, which produces PC-based tools,maintained that both PC- and mainframe-based code generators are important.andM;Mainframe tools, such as those included in the PC- and mainframe-integratedtools of KnowledgeWare Inc. in Atlanta, and Dallas-based Texas InstrumentsInc., require more of an investment.andM;According to Dunn, however, the mainframe environment is ''good for largegroups of programmers working from a common data dictionary residing on themainframe.''andM;By contrast, he added, the PC-based code-generating environment works betterwhen there are ''people working individually or working on parts of a largerproject.'' He added that PCs are more interactive and give developers morepower.andM;----------Janet Mason is a Philadelphia-based free-lance journalist specializing incomputer technology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
