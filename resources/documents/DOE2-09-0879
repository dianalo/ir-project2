The major objectives of theprogram were the following: (1) collecting data that allow a comparisonof metals and organic compound emissions during steady-state and transientincinerator operation, (2) evaluating scrubber removal efficiencies forspecific compounds, and (3) establishing cause and effect relationshipsbetween incinerator operating conditions and emissions. The technicalapproach first involved selection of appropriate test sites. Three siteswith multiple hearth incinerators and one site with a fluidized-bed incineratorwere selected. Sampling and analysis plans were then prepared for theoverall project and for each specific site. At the time of preparationof the paper, testing at all four sites had been completed. Reportedhere are preliminary compilations of data and associated analyses thatare now available.</TEXT></DOC>
