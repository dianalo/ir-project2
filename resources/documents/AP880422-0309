Sales during the period totaled $1.03 billion, vs. $896 millionlast year.   Borden, which makes a number of consumer food products as wellas professional products such as glue and paint, attributed itsresults to strong sales and acquisitons.   ``Acquisitions over the past year were a major factor in theserecord figures, but we also benefited from improvements in ourongoing businesses,'' Chairman R.J. Ventres said in a statementprepared for Friday's stockholders meeting in Flemington, N.J.   ``Margins were up slightly in dairy, our base U.S. snacks andpasta businesses both posted higher sales and income, and overseasour food joint venture in Spain and our chemical specialties unitsdid especially well.''
