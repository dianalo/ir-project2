Goeken, a former chiefexecutive officer who now is a direct competitor.   The settlement frees Mr. Goeken, 60 years old, to resumecontrol of closely held In-Flight Phone Corp., which isplanning to challenge Airfone's monopoly in the air-to-groundtelephone business.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Goeken founded Airfone in 1975 and sold it to GTE in1986. But he left Airfone in 1989 and founded In-Flight afterfriction developed with GTE.   Since then, Mr. Goeken has sought to have courts void anoncompete agreement he signed with GTE, and has pursued asuit alleging that GTE breached its contract. In August, anIllinois court ruled that Mr. Goeken was bound by the termsof that pact; since then, his daughter, Sandra Goeken, hasofficially headed In-Flight and his wife has assumedownership of his majority of the company's stock.   The noncompete agreement related to Mr. Goeken personallyand didn't seek to block In-Flight in any way.   Mr. Goeken said he won a court fight last year on thebreach-of-contract issue, and that a trial on damages hadbeen set for this summer. The settlement GTE announced todayquashes that suit, too. Mr. Goeken said GTE agreed to pay himand the other original Airfone investors $15.5 million, whichwill be reduced by the group's litigation expenses.   In late December, In-Flight was one of four new firmscleared by the Federal Communications Commission to provideair-to-ground phone service. In-Flight is thought to be theclosest to launching such service. Mr. Goeken said In-Flightwill install its first phones in American, USAir, andNorthwest jetliners in June, with ground system constructionset for June and July. GTE declined to provide details of thesettlement.</TEXT></DOC>
