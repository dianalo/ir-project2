The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 38.96 points at1,964.69 at 3 p.m. EDT.   The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocksoutstripped advancers by about 7-to-1 on the New York StockExchange, with 1,380 issues losing, only 214 gaining and 351unchanged.   Volume on the Big Board was 154.2 million shares.   More than a half-dozen big U.S. banks boosted their prime ratesby a half percentage point to 9 percent _ the first increase in theprime since just before October's stock market collapse.   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first big bank to raise the keyrate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a baserate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, includingmortgages. Chase's move was announced around noon today after WallStreet had already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears.   ``It clearly hit a raw nerve ... this market was clearlyvulnerable,'' said Monte Gordon, vice president and director ofresearch for Dreyfus Corp.   The hike in the prime came against a background of growingedginess about the outlook for interest rates.   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicatedearlier today that there could be an internationally coordinatedboost in rates.   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the WallStreet Journal's overseas editions that was published today, notedthat a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leadingnations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' followingthe Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.inflation.   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed thatthe Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defendedthe move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recentgrowth in the money supply.   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise itskey discount rate, the interest it charges big financialinstitutions, possibly this week.   Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend todampen companies' expansion plans and investments.   The NYSE's composite index was down 2.33 at 143.42.
