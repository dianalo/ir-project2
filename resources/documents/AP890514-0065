TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel's coalition Cabinet on Sunday overcamedeep divisions and endorsed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's20-point plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip.   The plan passed by a 20-6 vote after an intense seven-hourdebate.   It calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiateon a plan for eventual self-rule, but specifically rules outnegotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and saysIsrael will oppose creation of a Palestinian state.   Many Palestinian leaders rejected the plan.   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said in Tunis, Tunisia, thatthe PLO executive committee would meet ``and then we may have aresponse to the plan. The PLO leadership must look over the mainpoints before we will have any comment.''   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner called the vote a ``great victory''for the 73-year-old premier. ``It is the first time the Likud andLabor have been able to unite behind one plan,'' Pazner told TheAssociated Press.   Observers suggested one reason for the positive vote by thefractious coalition was that the plan sidestepped controversialissues, such as Palestinian demands for international supervisionof elections and for the participation of the 140,000 Arabs in eastJerusalem.   Another Shamir spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said approval of theKnesset, the Israeli parliament, was not necessary for the plan.The Likud-Labor coalition has a majority in the Knesset.   Pazner said the key question is whether an Arab partner could befound for negotiations. He said this would be the focus of U.S.State Department envoy Dennis Ross' forthcoming trip to Egypt andJordan. Shamir briefed Ross for 45 minutes after the Cabinetsession.   Pazner said Ross would return to Israel Tuesday and confer withShamir on Arab reactions.   Most prominent Palestinians reacted negatively to the plan,although Shamir picked up support from Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij.   Freij, considered a moderate, told Israel's Arabic TV thatShamir's plan is a ``worthy idea if it is fairly conducted underinternational supervision with the consent of the PLO and theparticipation of the residents of east Jerusalem.''   The plan calls for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Stripwith candidates chosen from districts. Those elected wouldnegotiate self-rule for the 1.7 million Palestinian residents ofthe territories.   Israel radio said that under the plan the occupied territorieswould be divided into 10 districts with each district representedby one person in the elected body.   After three years, talks would start on a permanent settlementof the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, with the same local negotiatorsplaying a ``central role.'' The settlement would be in the contextof a treaty between Jordan and Israel.   Ziad Abu Ziad, a leading Palestinian, criticized the planbecause it called for a treaty with Jordan, not with Palestinians.   Five prominent Palestinians sent a letter to U.S. Consul-GeneralPhillip Wilcox opposing the plan. ``We find the Shamir proposal ...grossly deficient in as much as it is not part of a politicalprocess that leads clearly to the establishment of an independentPalestinian state,'' they wrote.   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, ahard-line faction of the PLO, called the plan a ``falseenterprise'' aimed at undermining the Palestinian uprising andplans for an international Middle East peace conference.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a leader of the left-leaningLabor Party and author of key elements of the plan, said theCabinet vote meant that after a long period of paralysis, Israelhad a ``serious and practical plan.''   Communications Minister Gad Yacobi, also of Labor, said ``Ithink the Palestinians would be crazy not to accept the possibilityof electing representatives, a delegation to talk to Israel abouttheir own future.''   The daily Yediot Ahronot said Shamir believed elections could beheld within one year, while Rabin estimated six months were needed.   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon led right-wing opposition to theproposal, arguing it would intensify the Palestinian uprising,divide Jerusalem and lead to creation of a Palestinian state.   ``This plan ... carries a clear recipe for more violence, moreterrorism and even a danger of war,'' he said on Israel army radio.   At least 474 Palestinians have died in the 17-month Palestinianuprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip. Twenty-one Israelis have died.   Two Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli officialswere found dead Sunday, and Arab hospital reports said Israelisoldiers wounded at least 22 Arabs, including a 10-year-old boy hitwith a plastic bullet.</TEXT></DOC>
