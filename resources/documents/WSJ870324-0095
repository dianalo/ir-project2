Lear Petroleum Corp., Dallas, lost its liability insurance and some directors resigned, so shareholders approved a change in the corporate charter to shield board members from personal monetary liability in certain cases. UNC Resources Inc., Annapolis, Md., and Lukens Inc., Coatesville, Pa., join other companies in reincorporating in Delaware to take advantage of laws limiting directors' personal liability.    More than 20% of companies surveyed by executive recruiter Korn/Ferry International have been turned down by a prospective director, and many fear the problem may get worse. Of those companies that were turned down, 29% were refused more than once.    Directors quit some Southwest banks as loan losses mount: United Oklahoma Bancshares Inc. and BancTexas Group Inc. each lose 10 directors.    PART-TIME WORKERS could get better benefits under a New Hampshire law.    The new statute, effective this year, says that insurers can't bar part-time employees from participating in group health-insurance plans. &quot;It doesn't mandate participation&quot; but &quot;opens the door,&quot; says state Rep. Deborah Arnesen, sponsor of the legislation. Previously, she says, common policy was to exclude from group insurance coverage those who worked less than 30 hours a week.    The law, apparently the first of its kind, reflects the big growth in the part-time work force. Employers must begin offering &quot;appropriate benefits,&quot; says Gil Gordon of the newsletter Telecommuting Review. Insurers' policies vary: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. bars from coverage those who work less than 20 hours weekly but may waive the rule for big companies. Prudential Insurance Co. of America gives &quot;what the employer wants.&quot;    FEWER UNEMPLOYED get jobless insurance than ever before.    Only 33% of the unemployed received unemployment insurance benefits in an average month last year, the lowest level in the program's 52-year history, according to a study by the non-profit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Washington, D.C., research group says that, based on the monthly average, 5.5 million jobless people didn't receive benefits last year.    Among the major causes, the group cites continued, relatively high unemployment along with federal and state cuts in jobless insurance. Fewer than one in four jobless got benefits in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.    The lowest percentage of covered workers was in Virginia, where 15.9% got such benefits in an average month.    NO PEEKING: A bill introduced in the California legislature by Assemblyman Tom Hayden would bar employers from computer monitoring and other types of surveillance without notifying workers. It also would ban &quot;subliminal-message&quot; software programs used by employers. Computer-industry groups back monitoring as a &quot;legitimate&quot; tool.    A DEAF TRUCKER files suit in federal district court in Portland, Maine, challenging federal rules that bar interstate trucking companies from hiring deaf drivers. Michael Cousins's suit cites studies showing that deaf drivers have a better safety record than those who hear, a claim that's disputed by federal officials.    POST-STRIKE SCORE CARD: The Transportation Department, which has won hundreds of lawsuits filed by air traffic controllers fired in the 1981 strike, loses one. The Supreme Court lets stand a ruling that four controllers were fired illegally because they were on official leave to negotiate for the union at the time of the strike.    WORKPLACE LITERACY is the focus of a new campaign by ABC-TV and the public broadcasting industry, whose &quot;Project Literacy U.S.&quot; spotlighted national illiteracy problems. The effort to combat workforce illiteracy includes a planned TV documentary and work with business and literacy groups.    A NONSMOKER'S BEEF may open the way for employee lawsuits.    The Washington state Court of Appeals sends back to a lower court for trial an employee's negligence suit against the state Department of Social and Health Services. The nonsmoking employee alleged that workplace exposure to tobacco smoke caused her to develop a lung disease. Because she was denied worker compensation, the court ruled her case would have &quot;fallen into a crack&quot; between the worker compensation and tort systems.    This &quot;opens the door&quot; for nonsmoking employees alleging injuries to directly sue employers for negligence, says Robert Rosner, head of the Seattle-based Smoking Policy Institute, which advises businesses on smoking policy. He foresees &quot;a potential asbestos-type wave of legislation.&quot;    Department officials have asked the state Supreme Court to hear the case; no decision has been made yet.    THE CHECKOFF: The highest concentrations of millionaires are in Florida, the District of Columbia, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Hawaii, Vermont, Nevada, Kansas and Illinois, says a study by FIND/SVP, a New York market researcher. . . . Between 2% and 3% of the U.S. working population is involved in consulting, calculates Robert Kelley of Carnegie-Mellon University's business school. </TEXT></DOC>
