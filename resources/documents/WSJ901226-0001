The Secaucus, N.J., television station is being spun offto MCA shareholders because TV stations are prohibited frombeing more than 20%-owned by foreign interests. MCA holdersare to receive an &quot;equity stub&quot; in the station in addition tothe $66 a share they receive when the tender offer iscompleted. MCA has estimated the stub to be worth about $5 ashare; holders will receive one share of the new company forevery five MCA shares.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts believe the station will be sold within a shortperiod of time. MCA bought it for $386 million in 1987.   The acquisition of MCA by Matsushita is expected to becompleted anytime within the next three weeks. The Securitiesand Exchange Commission still must approve the transaction,and a hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles set forFriday will rule on one shareholder suit which hasn't joinedfive others in a tentative settlement. The tender offer isscheduled to expire Friday.   An antitrust suit filed by Go-Video Inc. seeking to blockthe merger is on appeal after a federal court in Phoenixdenied a temporary restraining order. Another shareholdersuit which had claimed that foreign ownership of a U.S. mediacompany violated the U.S. Constitution was dismissed by afederal judge in New York last Friday. A call by InteriorSecretary Manuel Lujan for a review of MCA's proposedplacement of its Yosemite Park and Curry Co. into escrowpending its sale isn't thought to be an obstacle tocompleting the merger.</TEXT></DOC>
