The proposal, the first to limit European military maneuvers, waspresented to Warsaw Pact delegates at the start of the latest roundof the talks.   Chief West German delegate Ruediger Hartmann called the packagethe ``most comprehensive, most detailed and most ambitious armscontrol system that was ever worked out for conventional forces.''   The NATO offer expands on a proposal the West made July 13 basedon a blueprint for deep reductions in arms and troops that PresidentBush unveiled at a NATO summit meeting in May.   Hartmann said the NATO package provides all the negotiatingmaterial needed to reach an agreement on conventional arms next year.   It proposes limiting the size of military maneuvers to 40,000 menand 800 tanks. One maneuver every two years would be allowed toexceed those limits.   The NATO paper also requires each side to give 42 days noticewhen calling up more than 40,000 reservists and would imposeceilings on the number of tanks, artillery pieces and personnelcarriers in active units.   It is little changed from a package offered two weeks ago at theopening session of the Vienna talks on reducing conventional forcesin Europe. A dispute among NATO members delayed its presentation.   Seven Warsaw Pact countries and 16 NATO members are taking partin the talks on conventional forces in Europe, which began in Marchand cover all of Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Uralmountains.   The measures proposed by the West today also provide for anextensive exchange of information as part of detailed verification,including routine inspections to see each side carries out pledgedreductions and maintains agreed upon ceilings. Western allies aredivided on this issue, with the United States and Canada seekingstrict surveillance, and their European partners objecting tofrequent inspections of their facilities by the Warsaw Pact.   Under the proposal, removal of equipment from monitored storageor units with a low level of readiness would be permitted only afterprior notification.   In its July proposal, NATO suggested each alliance have no morethan 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters. The July 13initiative also would restrict any one country to 3,420 aircraft and1,140 helicopter gunships.   Heavy armaments cuts are recommended, with a suggested ceiling of20,000 main battle tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 28,000 armoredpersonnel carriers for each side.   NATO also is proposing that U.S. and Soviet troops stationedoutside their national territory in Europe not exceed 275,000 each.   Diplomats for East and West are optimistic that preliminaryagreements can be reached next year and implemented by 1992 or 1993.   Negotiators have said the biggest problem in the current six-weekround of talks is weapons categories.   The most serious differences exist in aircraft.   The Warsaw pact, while not presenting specific figures, insists``air defense interceptors'' based near Moscow and the Urals beexcluded.   NATO objects. Western experts have expressed concern thatdefensive aircraft could be reconstructed for strike capabilities.   The Warsaw Pact has not yet responded to the West's Julyproposal, but in March proposed reducing six kinds of weapons,including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994. That would befollowed by a further 25 percent cut by 1997, with the ultimate goalof purely defensive forces by the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
