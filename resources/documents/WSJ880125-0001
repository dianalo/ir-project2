Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC JUS </G><DATELINE> SAN DIEGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who is leading the investigation of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal, hinted that his office may bring federal racketeering charges in future cases.    Addressing a meeting of securities lawyers here Friday, Mr. Giuliani said it would be appropriate to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute in cases where investigators find &quot;a multimillion- or multibillion-dollar scheme and a pattern of criminal activity.&quot;    Under RICO, defendants are subject to triple damages and attorney fees and, in criminal complaints, may be ordered to forfeit proceeds from unlawful activity. There has been much speculation recently that the next step in the Wall Street investigations will be to move beyond insider trading to broader questions such as market manipulation and tax evasion.    In a subsequent news conference, Mr. Giuliani said, &quot;We wouldn't be shy about using&quot; the racketeering law, not only to deal with insider trading but also with &quot;related crimes&quot; such as stock price manipulation.    Mr. Giuliani twice mentioned market manipulation as a concern. But he declined to elaborate on the subject, saying he wanted to avoid discussing &quot;cases we're investigating.&quot; He also declined to say whether an entire investment banking firm could be charged under the RICO law. As previously reported, one of the targets of the current investigation is Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a New York investment firm. Drexel has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.    Some prominent securities lawyers have been critical of Mr. Giuliani's handling of the Wall Street scandal, arguing that his office is bringing criminal charges for record-keeping violations and other relatively technical matters that previously were handled as civil cases.    In an apparent response to that criticism, Mr. Giuliani in his speech described insider trading as symptomatic of widespread corruption on Wall Street and elsewhere in the nation. &quot;All you have to do is raise your eyes up from your clients and books . . . and you will realize that we are facing a crisis in this country of unacceptable behavior among people at upper levels of our society,&quot; he told the assembled lawyers.    Mr. Giuliani is widely expected to run for the U.S. Senate this year in New York, and several audience members commented that he sounded as though he were already on the campaign trail. But he declined to say whether he will run.    Earlier at the same meeting of the Securities Regulation Institute of the University of California at San Diego, Gary Lynch, the chief of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that market manipulation is currently under &quot;intense focus&quot; at the SEC.    &quot;It's an area where you can expect to see more enforcement activity in the relatively near future,&quot; Mr. Lynch said. The SEC is primarily looking at manipulation of over-the-counter securities, but also is concerned by apparent cases of short-term manipulation of the prices of stocks with exchange listings, he said.    Separately, an SEC official in Washington studying corporate buy-back announcements for the agency's analysis of the October stock market crash said he concluded that those announcements had a &quot;significant&quot; effect on the market. Larry Bergmann, assistant director for trading practices in the SEC's division of market regulation, said that the agency would be concerned if it found that corporations had announced buy-backs without intending to follow through. But, he added &quot;we had no evidence of that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
