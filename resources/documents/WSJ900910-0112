The former senator, a Republican who won nationalattention for attacking Richard Nixon during Watergate andwho angered Ronald Reagan by opposing Contra aid, Star Wars,tax overhaul and school prayer, is running for governor as anindependent and is ahead in the polls.</LP><TEXT>   A towering Connecuticut Yankee in a rumpled size-17pinpoint oxford-cloth dress shirt, Mr. Weicker is the bull inthe genteel china shop of this state's politics. The shardsare already flying.   Mr. Weicker, defeated two years ago by Democrat JosephLieberman in a fight for a fourth Senate term, contends thepublic has &quot;a total revulsion toward both political parties.&quot;But Republican state Rep. Robert Maddox claims the Weickercampaign is &quot;one of the greatest charades since Barnum andBailey were around.&quot;   Whether visionary or opportunist, Mr. Weicker hastransformed the race to succeed retiring Democratic Gov.William O'Neill into a three-ring circus, with himself at thecenter of the tent. Rep. John Rowland, the Republicannominee, and the two Democrats battling in tomorrow's primary-- Congressman Bruce Morrison and state Rep. William Cibes --have been forced to struggle for bits of the limelight.   If Mr. Weicker prevails in November's election, his realchallenge remains ahead. Like other New England states,Connecticut suffers from deep economic distress; in a time ofeconomic growth, the state still lost 50,000 manufacturingjobs in five years. The current state budget is balancedprecariously on $570 million of onetime savings, includingdeferred pension contributions for state employees andteachers, and the state faces the possibility of running adeficit of $1 billion or more next year.   &quot;The next governor is going to have an enormouslydifficult job -- the biggest challenge any Connecticutgovernor has faced in modern times,&quot; says former GOP Rep.Lawrence DeNardis, president of the Connecticut PublicExpenditure Council, a nonpartisan analysis group. &quot;The sizeand scope of the problems are staggering.&quot;   Mr. Weicker's response is one part Ronald Reagan, one partFranklin Roosevelt: repeal the corporate-tax surcharge andthe utility tax on nonmanufacturing businesses, establish $25million of targeted tax incentives for depressed rural areasand big cities, and start a public-works program to providejobs.   The magnitude of Connecticut's problems is feeding Mr.Weicker's attack. &quot;If I get elected,&quot; he says, &quot;there's ashot being fired across the bow of the two parties.&quot;   This anti-politics movement is being led by a rebel who isstill a registered Republican. Mr. Weicker, whose familybuilt the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, prepped at theLawrenceville School before going on to Yale and theUniversity of Virginia Law School. Today he lives in a250-year-old house in Greenwich that is paneled with woodfrom Daniel Webster's home; monogrammed cocktail napkinscarrying the words &quot;Applejack Farm,&quot; the 17th-century name ofthe property, sit on the coffee table. Two of hisstandard-bred trotting horses run at Rosecroft Raceway inMaryland. His adjusted gross income last year was $448,000.   He has given Connecticut's well-entrenched two-partysystem its biggest shock since 1938, when Socialist JasperMcLevy siphoned off enough votes to enable a Republican todefeat longtime Democratic Gov. Wilbur Cross. If he wins, Mr.Weicker would be only the third independent governor in theU.S. this century, and lawmakers and pundits already arecontemplating how the hoary customs of Hartford might fare ifthe governor has no party members to call on in thelegislature.   &quot;There will still be a legislature full of Republicans andDemocrats,&quot; says Morton Tenzer, a University of Connecticutpolitical scientist. &quot;Weicker doesn't have any candidates ofhis own, and he won't have any `Weickerite' members of thelegislature.&quot;   But already there are defections from the two majorparties. Last month, Mr. Weicker won the backing of twoRepublicans, former gubernatorial candidate Joseph McGee andstate Rep. Mae Schmidle, and of a prominent black Democratfrom New Haven, state Rep. Walter Brooks.   &quot;To blacks he offers an opportunity to see atransformation of the political process,&quot; says Wendell Harp,a Democratic architect from New Haven. &quot;Here we have anopportunity to have a major office won by someone who has noties to the two parties. It gives us an opportunity not to betaken for granted.&quot; John Einhorn, a New Haven aldermanprominent in Republican political circles, adds: &quot;We needsomething new, a new direction.&quot;   Mr. Weicker's gambit has caused bitterness within theRepublican Party. Marie Phelan, former GOP town chairman inKillingsworth, says she's &quot;in tune with his views&quot; but won'tsupport Mr. Weicker because &quot;I have a real problem with whathe's doing.&quot; Fellow Republicans told the Fairfield GOPchairman that he was &quot;finished&quot; when he announced his supportof Mr. Weicker, who had been regarded as something of anideological turncoat when he was running on the Republicanline.   Many analysts attribute Mr. Weicker's 1988 defeat to thefailure of conservative Republicans to vote for him. &quot;I haveno reason to complain about what he's doing now,&quot; says GOPstate Rep. Thomas Scott. &quot;I've wanted him out of the partyfor 10 years.&quot;   Mr. Weicker's campaign as an independent -- technicallyhe's running as a candidate of what he calls &quot;A ConnecticutParty&quot; -- is itself a symbol of how the Republican Party haschanged. He came out of the liberal wing of the GOP that, inConnecticut, had its deepest roots in his home town ofGreenwich and in the executive suites of the insurancecompanies of Hartford. These Republicans, clearlyestablishment figures, were strong supporters of WendellWilkie in 1940 and later sided with Thomas Dewey and DwightEisenhower against Robert Taft.   Today, Connecticut's Republicans are more conservative,more Catholic and have more working-class roots than they didwhen Mr. Weicker became a member of the Connecticut generalassembly and launched a career that would take him to theHouse and finally the Senate. In time, Mr. Weicker, now 59years old, grew weary of the estrangement he felt in his ownparty. He is running as an independent as much by necessityas by choice.   &quot;If I was going to do this, it wasn't going to be for aphilosophical discussion within the party,&quot; he says. &quot;I don'twant some delegate from some town putting his finger in myeye and asking me why I voted for the Panama Canal Treaty. IfI was going to do it, I was going all the way.&quot;   So now Mr. Weicker is wagering that the state thatproduced practical men like Eli Whitney and Seth Thomas mightagain show the rebellious streak that also offered refuge tosuch iconoclasts as patriot leader Nathan Hale, abolitionistJohn Brown and writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain.He's seeking to make a virtue of his lack of partynomination, boasting that he was nominated not by &quot;900politicians huddled in the Civic Center&quot; but by the 105,430people who signed his ballot petition.   &quot;This is deregulated politics,&quot; he says. &quot;All I've done iscreated more competition. Business has high prices and badproducts when there is a monopoly. The same is true withpolitics. The two-party system has gotten people in a hell ofa lot of trouble in this country.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
