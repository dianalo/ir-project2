Refuge fishing programs are reviewed annually todetermine whether the regulations governing fishing on individual refugesshould be modified. Changing environmental conditions, State and Federalregulations and other factors affecting fish populations and habitats maywarrant such amendments. The modifications will ensure the continued compatibilityof fishing with the purposes for which the individual refuges involvedwere established, and to the extent practical, make refuge fishing programsconsistent with State regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>David E.

Fishing is regulated on refuges to: (1) Ensurecompatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the fishery resourceand (3) protect other refuge values. On many refuges, the Service policyof adopting State fishing regulations is an adequate way of meeting theseobjectives. On other refuges it is necessary to supplement State regulationswith refuge-specific fishing regulations which will ensure that the Servicemeets its management responsibilities, as outlined under the section entitled``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specificfishing regulations are issued only after the final publication of theopening of a wildlife refuge to fishing. These regulations may list theseasons, methods of taking fish, descriptions of open areas and other provisions.The Service previously issued refuge-specific fishing regulations in 50CFR Part 33.This final rule is amending and supplementing certain refuge-specific regulationsin 50 CFR Part 33, andSection;andSection; 33.5 through 33.55, which pertainto fishing on individual refuges in their respective alphabetically listedStates.The policy of the Department of the Interior (Department) is, wheneverpracticable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in therulemaking process. Accordingly, the October 5, 1987, proposed rule hada 30-day comment period. No public comments were received. Therefore, theproposed refuge-specific fishing regulations will be published, with minortechnical corrections, as final in this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities</ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966,as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and the public use of NWRs. Specifically,section 4(d)(1)(A) of the Refuge System Administration Act authorizes theSecretary of the Interior (Secretary) under such regulations as he mayprescribe, to permit the use of any area within the System for any purpose,including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and accommodationsand access when he determines that such uses are compatible with the majorpurposes for which such areas were established.The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer the refugeareas within the National Wildlife Refuge System for public recreationas an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that itis practicable and not inconsistent with the primary objectives for whichthe area was established. The Refuge Recreation Act also authorizes theSecretary to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.Fishing plans are developed for each fishing program on a refuge priorto the opening of the refuge to fishing. In many cases, refuge-specificfishing regulations are included as a part of the fishing plans to ensurethe compatibility of the fishing programs with the purposes for which therefuge was established. Compliance with the NWRSAA and Refuge RecreationAct is ensured when the fishing plans are developed and the determinationsrequired by these Acts are made prior to the addition of the refuge tothe list of areas open to fishing in 50 CFR. Continued compliance is ensuredby annual review of fishing programs and regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in cost of pricesfor consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions; or significant adverse effects on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. The Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.These proposed amendments to the codified refuge-specific fishing regulationswill make relatively minor adjustments to existing fishing programs. Theregulations are not expected to have any gross economic effect and willnot cause an increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies or geographic regions. Thebenefits accruing to the public are expected to exceed the costs of administeringthis rule. Accordingly, the Department has determined that this rule isnot a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 and willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for the information collection requirements of these regulationspursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OBM underandplusmin;1018-0014 Economic and Public Use Permits. These regulations imposeno new reporting or recordkeeping requirements that must be cleared byOMB. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)is ensured when fishing plans are developed and the determinations requiredby these Acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the list ofareas open to sport fishing in 50 CFR. Refuge-specific fishing regulationsare subject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process if they donot significantly alter the existing use of a particular NWR. The changesproposed in this rulemaking will not significantly alter the existing usesof the refuges involved.Information regarding the conditions that apply to individual refuge fishingprograms, any restrictions related to public use on the refuge and a mapof the refuge are available at refuge headquarters.
