The Taj has been rising in fits and starts along the boardwalk. A year or so of construction work remains, and the rich New York developer, whose name instantly conjures up visions of lavish spending, finds himself having to cut costs.    He won't find that easy. He seems interested in building a Taj even glitzier than originally planned. Despite already-staggering cost overruns, he is replacing the &quot;tin pots&quot; with crystal chandeliers -- as many as 60 of them -- running about $100,000 apiece. But if he fails to make the Taj successful as well as lavish, it may become a white elephant producing no more profit than the mausoleum in India.    Even before Mr. Trump became involved with the Taj, it was envisioned as the biggest casino in town. Bristling with domes and minarets, glittering with lights, it was supposed to be the gaming palace that would make the action elsewhere look like back-room poker games. It was also to be open by now.    But so far, only the hotel, a sleek 42-story tower, looks like the architect's drawings. The rest of the complex hulks up as an unfinished, 17-acre expanse of steel and concrete, exposed duct-work and drooping cables. What the early promotions described as the &quot;Wonder of the Gaming World,&quot; a gambling publication now calls the &quot;Taj Mirage.&quot;    Mr. Trump laid claim to the Taj last year, when he took over its owner, Resorts International Inc. He contended that he was the big-league developer who could salvage the Taj from the snafus of previous management, attract the financing needed to complete construction and adorn the property with the appropriate glitz.    Over the past month, Mr. Trump had to fight for the chance to make good on his boast. Merv Griffin, the talk-show host turned tycoon, made a bid for Resorts, setting off a highly publicized takeover battle between two of America's richest men. But last week, they reached a tentative pact: Mr. Griffin would take over the company; Mr. Trump would keep the Taj.    Mr. Trump is also keeping a lot of problems. Already, the construction tab for the Taj has soared to some $630 million. Add in related items -- principally land acquisition and debt service -- and the total reaches $930 million. At least, that is Resorts' latest projection.    The numbers blur. In 1979, when Resorts was contemplating expansion of its original casino-hotel here along with construction of a new hotel, the company casually projected a construction budget of something &quot;in excess of $175 million.&quot;    Part of the surge in costs is due to the expanded design, part to inflation, part perhaps to a low initial estimate. And part may defy analysis. &quot;Some of the numbers we'll never find,&quot; a Trump aide says. Mr. Trump himself admits he bought into some rude surprises at the Taj, although he has also run up the tab by adding touches of his own -- such as the chandeliers.    Marvin Roffman, a securities analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., estimates that the Taj's winnings -- the gamblers' losses -- would have to average about $1 million a day for it to break even. No casino here rakes in nearly that much, and expansions at other casinos will step up the competition. The Taj, Mr. Roffman says, &quot;is like an expensive movie. It's big and beautiful, but you don't know if it's going to make any money.&quot;    For the moment, funds to complete the Taj have run dry, and construction has slowed to nearly a halt since last December. Meanwhile, carrying costs -- debt service, taxes, maintenance -- have been piling up at the rate of about $160,000 a day. Simply resuming work will be no penny-ante game: Dozens of contractors and more than 1,000 workers must be called back.    How did the Taj sink to this?    It all began with James Crosby, Resorts' chairman until his death in 1986 and the man who brought casinos to Atlantic City. Along the way, he also picked up an urban-renewal obligation to build a new hotel. But by the time construction started in 1983, the hotel had evolved into the Taj: a hotel-cum-casino-cum-convention center. Ballrooms and parking garages were thrown in, too. So was the rebuilding of Steel Pier, which extends out from the boardwalk in front of the Taj.    As construction went forward, the design continued to change. The casino was to be 100,000 square feet, then 120,000, then 100,000 again, then, once more, 120,000. Also briefly considered was a cutback to only 15,000 square feet.    &quot;We didn't even have a plan,&quot; says I.G. &quot;Jack&quot; Davis Jr., then and now Resorts' president. &quot;You just said, 'Keep building'&quot; -- he gives a wave of the hand -- &quot;'that way.'&quot;    After the steel frame went up, some areas weren't sealed off fast enough. Rain ruined about $1 million of wallboard.    And then there were the domes, onion-shaped and rigged with fiber optics that could switch from one pulsating color to another: green for St. Patrick's Day, red, white and blue on the Fourth of July. Though seeming brilliant in trials, they appeared faint from the boardwalk once the domes were up. Humble light bulbs may take the place of fiber optics.    Big as the Taj now appears to boardwalk strollers, it seems bigger from the inside. What is to be the casino spreads over a space larger than two football fields. The construction details are countless, for the gambling public must be fed (3,430 restaurant seats), lodged (1,257 hotel rooms) and scrutinized (surveillance catwalks and cameras by the gaming tables).    Following in a casino-hotel tradition, the decorators won't hesitate to stray from the main, Indian theme. One of the restaurants planned for the Taj is French, one Italian. Another will try to evoke a safari by having waiters wear pith helmets.    By the time Mr. Trump entered the picture, Resorts was trying to bring the Taj under control by scaling it back, as by leaving the top floor of the hotel, with all its luxury suites, unfinished. He returned to the full-scale plans and ordered brass and Italian marble in place of cheaper materials that Resorts had intended to use. He estimates that the marble will bump up the cost of the Taj by an additional $2 million or so. &quot;Peanuts,&quot; he says, &quot;compared with the overall cost of the job.&quot;    He also convened formal construction meetings, where he would both coax and badger contractors. When someone once noted a point on which state regulators still had to be satisfied, he shot back, &quot;Heh, tell them they can finish the building.&quot;    Yet some people question whether trouble at the Taj is so deep as Mr. Trump portrayed it while negotiating concessions, such as a lucrative contract he exacted from Resorts to manage the Taj even though he was the company chairman. &quot;If the thing was as bad off as he led us to believe,&quot; asks someone familiar with construction here, &quot;why did he want it?&quot;    Mr. Trump's estimates of the additional financing needed, ranging upward from $425 million, have brought scoffs from aides to Mr. Griffin. Mr. Trump himself has contended that, once he becomes sole owner of the Taj, he can borrow at more favorable rates.    Full terms of the Trump-Griffin pact still haven't been disclosed. But if Mr. Trump walks away with the Taj at a price far lower than what Resorts has already sunk into it, he may avoid the financial squeeze that plagued his predecessors.    Meanwhile, the Taj sits along the boardwalk, raw, massive and lifeless, eliciting both awe and jokes from passers-by. A few Taj-related inspirations may never be revived. Blimp service, for example.    The blimp, never manufactured but seen by Resorts as the world's largest, was to take off from docks along the Hudson River with as many as 200 passengers, scud down the East Coast, then tie up at the end of Steel Pier. But after experience with a smaller advertising blimp, Resorts began worrying about the windy coastal weather. The idea was shot down.    The effort to rebuild the pier is at sea, too, leaving a gap of green ocean between the old and the new sections. Reaching the Taj from the spot once imagined as the blimp port would now require a boat ride or a swim. </TEXT></DOC>
