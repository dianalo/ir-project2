Consequently, it containsprovisions which are for practical purposes now obsolete and others whichhave not been updated to reflect more recent legal developments and thechanging nature of the railroad industry. Thus, the Board has decided toreplace old Part 203 with a new Part 203.Service for a railroad by an individual is covered under the Railroad RetirementAct only when performed in the capacity of an employee. Service by an independentcontractor is not covered. Specifically, the new Part, at andSection; 203.2,delineates factors as to when an individual is performing service for arailroad as an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. In determiningwhether an individual is an employee or independent contractor, the Boardwill apply the commonly recognized tests developed under common law. Thesecriteria are essentially the same tests used by the Internal Revenue Servicein determining whether an individual is an employee or independent contractorfor employment tax purposes.In addition, the Railroad Retirement Act provides that where an individualis rendering professional or technical services to an employer and is integratedin the staff of the employer or is rendering personal services on the propertyused in the operations of the employer, that person is an employee of theemployer, even if under the common law test such person would be consideredan independent contractor. These provisions, with examples, are also setforth at andSection; 203.2.Service by an employee of a railroad whose principal place of businessis the United States is covered service no matter where performed. Thus,an employee working in Japan for a United States railroad is covered underthe Railroad Retirement Act. An exception to this rule applies to employeesof United States railroads, who are neither citizens nor residents of theUnited States, when rendering service outside the United States, if thelaw of the place of service requires that the railroad fill its positionswith local citizens or residents.Recently, the Board held that service for United States railroads operatingin Canada by employees who were neither citizens nor residents of the UnitedStates was not covered service since the immigration law of that countryrequired the employment of Canadians for most railroad jobs. This decisionwas upheld in <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association </T3>v. <T3>Railroad Retirement Board,</T3> 842 F. 2d 466 (D.C. Cir. 1988). ProposedandSection; 203.4 (Service outside the United States_United States employer)incorporates the criteria used by the Board, and approved by the court,to determine when a foreign country's law requires that United States railroadsoperating in that country are required to hire local citizens rather thanUnited States citizens.Finally, the provisions of old andSection; 203.5, dealing with when serviceto a local lodge or division, or general committee of a railway labor organizationnot conducting the principal part of its business within the United Statesis covered under the Act, were not included in new Part 203. These oldprovisions essentially parroted provisions which are still found in theAct, but have very limited application.The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder No. 12291; therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35) do notapply.A distribution table is provided to show the distribution of the old Part203.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Current section and name</H1><H1>New section and name</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">203.1 Statutory provisions<D>Unnecessary.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.2 General definition of employee<D>203.1 General definition of employee.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.3 When an individual is performing service for an employer<D>203.2 When an individual is performing service for an employer.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.4 When service is compensated<D>203.3 When service is compensated.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.5 Service outside the United States, Paragraph (a)<D>203.5 Service outside the United States_Foreign employer.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.5 Service outside the United States, Paragraph (b) through end<D>Unnecessary.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.6 Age, citizenship, and other factors<D>203.4 Service outside the United States_United States employer.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.7 Local lodge employee<D>203.6 Local lodge employee.</D></ITAG></ITAG>A derivation table is provided to show the sources of the revised Part203.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,xs30,r50</C> <H1>New section</H1><H1>Old section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">203.1<D>203.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.2<D>203.3.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.3<D>203.4 (first sentence preceding the words ``</D><T3>Provided, however</T3>.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.4<D>203.6 (that part beginning with the words ``except that an individual''and ending before the words ``and the laws in force'').</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.5<D>203.5 (paragraph (a)).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">203.6<D>203.7 (second sentence).</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 203</ITAG>Railroad employees, Railroad retirement.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 20, Chapter II, Part 203of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be revised to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 203_EMPLOYEES UNDER THE ACT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.1 General definition of employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.2 When an individual is performing service for an employer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.3 When service is compensated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.4 Service outside the United States_United States employer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.5 Service outside the United States_foreign employer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">203.6 Local lodge employee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 45 U.S.C. 231 and 45 U.S.C. 231f.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 203.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General definition of employee.</ITAG>An individual shall be an employee whenever:(a) He or she is engaged in performing compensated service for an employerin the capacity of an employee, or (b) He or she is in an employment relation to an employer (see Part 204of this chapter), or(c) He or she is an employee representative (see Part 205 of this chapter),or(d) He or she is an officer of an employer.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 203.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">When an individual is performing service for an employer.</ITAG>(a) In determining whether an individual is performing service for an employerin the capacity of an employee, the Board will apply the commonly recognizedtests of employee-independent contractor status developed under the commonlaw.

In addition, X works on the premisesof the employer, is paid by the hour, and devotes a substantial portionof his or her time to the performance of the contract.
