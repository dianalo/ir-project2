State Italian television has reported the Itavia DC-9 wasaccidentally shot down with a missile fired by a warplane from aNATO country, perhaps Italy. The accident occurred June 27, 1980.   ``I can confirm that there was no NATO exercise in the areabetween May 16 and Sept. 27, 1980,'' NATO Secretary-General ManfredWoerner said Thursday. ``We will do anything we can which could helpin the investigation. NATO has nothing to hide. If requested, wewill give any assistance, any support.''   On Wednesday, Premier Ciriaco de Mita ordered a governmentinvestigation. Speaking to parliament Thursday, Defense MinisterValerio Zanone again rejected reports that an Italian fighter jetmay have downed the plane.   Woerner said De Mita requested NATO assistance during a meetingThursday and that he assured the premier that NATO would cooperate.   Woerner, a former West German defense minister who became NATOsecretary-general on July 1, also met Thursday with PresidentFrancesco Cossiga, Zanone and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.   Repeating previous assurances, Zanone told parliament there wereno Italian warplanes in the area on the day of the accident and thatthere were no Italian military excercises there.</TEXT></DOC>
