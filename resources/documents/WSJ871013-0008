Brody.    However, some industry analysts said the chances of the Comex contract succeeding were not favorable.    The contract is considered likely to be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is scheduled to decide the matter Oct. 27, Mr. Brody said.    That day the CFTC also is slated to make its decision on a corporate-bond index futures contract proposed by the Chicago Board of Trade, he said. Among other instruments, the CBOT trades Treasury bond and Treasury note futures, and its Treasury bond instrument is the most popular futures contract in the U.S.    The Comex bond-index futures will be based on Moody's index of 80 investment grade corporate issues rated Baa and higher, Mr. Brody said. The rating concern introduced the index in April.    The futures could be bought for March, June, September or December delivery and would cover a two-year cycle.    The CBOT's corporate bond-index futures contract will be based on an index devised by the exchange and comprising 100 investment grade issues. The exchange hopes to start trading the contract &quot;within weeks&quot; of CFTC approval, a spokesman said.    The Comex, which currently trades gold, silver and copper contracts, decided to introduce financial futures because it intends to diversify, Mr. Brody said.    However, the proposed contract follows repeated failures by the Comex to launch financial futures instruments. The exchange, for instance, several years ago offered futures on 90-day Treasury bills, Ginnie Mae certificates from the Government National Mortgage Association and two-year Treasury notes -- all with no success.    And some industry executives suggested that the latest proposal also has little chance. They said that the bond-futures market is centered on the large Chicago exchanges and that any new bond-related instrument would take off there, if at all.    Moreover, some analysts said, the corporate bond market itself isn't active enough to support a liquid corporate-bond index futures contract.    &quot;With so many strikes against them, it would take a wild stretch of imagination to think Comex could garner that market with no success to date at financial futures,&quot; an industry official in New York said.    The Comex &quot;decided to introduce Moody's index futures because it will be a more perfect trading hedge against volatile&quot; corporate bond prices, Mr. Brody said.    While institutions, investment banks and other professional traders currently trade Treasury bonds as a sort of insurance against fluctuations in corporate bond prices, Mr. Brody said, the path of the government bond prices doesn't exactly parallel that of corporate bond prices.    In addition to the bond-index futures contract, the Comex currently has applications before the CFTC for futures contracts on interest-rate swaps and repurchase agreements.    A Comex official declined to speculate when those contracts would begin trading and also said an exact date hadn't been set for the launching of the Moody's index-based contract. </TEXT></DOC>
