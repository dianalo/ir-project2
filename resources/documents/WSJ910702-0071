By retiring in the middle of the 1988 football season, theflamboyant defensive end deprived his family of adequatesupport and wasted a substantial marital asset, a SuffolkCounty, N.Y., Supreme Court judge ruled. The judge awardedone-third of this forfeited salary -- or more than $100,000-- to Mr. Gastineau's ex-wife, who has custody of theirnine-year-old daughter.</LP><TEXT>   The decision is unusual -- and potentially troubling todivorced income earners -- because the judge did not accuseMr. Gastineau of quitting in an intentional effort to evadedivorce-related payments. Traditionally, courts have punishedwage-earners who quit out of spite by awarding part of theirforfeited salaries to spouses. But only recently have judgesbegun to apply this principle more broadly, arguing thatfamilial obligations must take precedence over personalcareer decisions.   &quot;This idea that free will isn't really free when you're indivorce proceedings is anathema to me,&quot; said family lawattorney Joseph DuCanto of Schiller, DuCanto andamp; Fleck inChicago. &quot;I thought Lincoln freed the slaves 150 years ago.But I guess the days of indentured servants have notdisappeared in America.&quot; Mr. DuCanto called the judge&quot;imperious&quot; for attempting to dictate Mr. Gastineau'spriorities.   Mr. Gastineau quit six games into the 1988 season. At thetime he said he wanted to spend more time with histhen-fiancee, actress Brigitte Nielsen. He has not workedsince, except for a brief, unsuccessful comeback attempt withthe Canadian Football League in 1990.   If Mr. Gastineau had retired on the advice of a physician,he probably could not have been charged with squanderingmarital assets, said John Wendel, president of the SportsLawyers Association in Lakeland, Fla. But his decision toretire for purely personal reasons could be construed asirresponsible, he added.   &quot;It's a very common practice now to consider employmentcontracts acquired during marriage as valuable propertysubject to equitable distribution in court just like homes orartwork,&quot; said Larry H. Schatz, the attorney for Mr.Gastineau's wife, Lisa.   Many states, including New York, have statutes designed topunish wasteful dissipation of marital assets by awarding aportion of the squandered assets to the spouse.   &quot;More and more, the courts are moving toward looking intowhether quitting a job is a reasonable or responsibledecision,&quot; said Maryanne LaGuardia, a family law attorneywith Trope andamp; Trope in Los Angeles. Legitimate career movesare condoned in court, she said, but &quot;bad faith&quot; actions --like abandoning a million-dollar plastic surgery practice orquitting in the middle of a sports season -- are condemned.   Wage-earners must balance their personal career goals withtheir responsibility to support their families, she said --and often, the court decides that &quot;the first obligationshould be to honor a commitment to the family. If you shouldbe working and aren't, the court can second-guess yourearning potential,&quot; Ms. LaGuardia added.   In the Gastineau case, the judge declined to speculateabout how much Mr. Gastineau could have earned had hecontinued to play football, basing the settlement solely onthe defensive end's 1988 contract with the Jets.   &quot;It was a very well-founded decision but we feel the judgedidn't go far enough,&quot; said Mr. Schatz, who had requested ashare of Mr. Gastineau's projected 1989 earnings for hisclient.   Mr. Gastineau couldn't be reached for comment.   ---   LIFE SUPPORT can't be ended by hospital against wishes offamily.   In a test case, the Hennepin County Medical Center inMinneapolis sought to override family objections and cut offlife support for Helga Wanglie, an 87-year-old retired schoolteacher who has been hospitalized in an irreversible coma formore than a year.   The case involved a reversal of the usual roles inso-called &quot;right to die&quot; cases because the doctors -- not thefamily-- sought a court ruling to terminate treatment whenthere was no realistic hope of recovery. Argued during afour-day hearing before Hennepin County Probate JudgePatricia L. Belois in May, the case attracted nationalattention from specialists in medicine, ethics and law.   But in her seven-page opinion, Judge Belois skirted anydiscussion of the larger ethical issues, finding only that inthis instance the patient's husband, Oliver Wanglie, aretired lawyer who also is 87 years old, is &quot;most suitableand best qualified&quot; to serve in his wife's best interest. Thejudge granted Mr. Wanglie's petition to remain as his wife'sguardian over a request by a hospital ethic consultant toappoint an independent conservator.   &quot;The principle she felt bound with is the presumption thatyou can't supplant a competent loving family member with astranger,&quot; said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center forBiomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. However,the court didn't say whether there might ever becircumstances under which the hospital's view would prevailover that of family members.   Mrs. Wanglie was hospitalized after suffering a heartattack and massive brain damage over a year ago. According toAssistant Hennepin County Attorney Michael B. Miller, Mr.Wanglie is &quot;hoping for a miracle&quot; and &quot;not dealing veryrationally with the hospital or his wife's health needs.&quot;   But Minneapolis attorney Barry W. McKee, representing Mr.Wanglie, maintained that by seeking to shut off Mrs.Wanglie's life support, the hospital was intruding in &quot;whatis a family decision.&quot; Mr. Miller said the county has noplans to appeal.   ---   GRANDPARENTS can visit grandchildren over parents'objections.   New York's highest court said grandparents have the rightto seek the visits even when the child's immediate familyremains intact. Before this decision, grandparents alreadyhad been granted visitation rights when the child's parentswere deceased, divorced or unfit.   The case was brought by Emanuel S., who had a falling outwith his daughter and son-in-law a year after his grandsonMax E.'s birth. (Court records in such cases do not includelast names.)   Emanuel hasn't seen Max since September 1990, when a NewYork intermediate appellate court dismissed his visitationsuit. That court had ruled that grandparents have no legalright to visit a grandchild over objections of both of thechild's parents.   Leslie I. Levine, a White Plains, N.Y., lawyer for thegrandfather, said the decision favoring grandparents couldinfluence other courts that take up the issue, as well asplay a role in legislative battles on the question in anumber of states.   Max's parents had argued in the New York case that givinggrandparents visitation rights against the parents'objections was unconstitutional because it interfered withparents' rights to rear their children as they see fit. Inissuing its decision yesterday, the high court refused torule on the constitutional issue. The court said instead thatit had found nothing in the state's laws that prohibitsgrandparents from seeking visitation.   Nonetheless, the court went on to write that it is notenough that the grandparents &quot;allege love and affection fortheir grandchild.&quot; Instead, the court said it would requiregrandparents to demonstrate that they have tried to foster arelationship with the child.   David Pikus, a New York lawyer representing Max's parents,said the ruling &quot;does not necessarily suggest that thegrandfather is entitled to visitation.&quot; He said the trialcourt will have to determine what's in the best interests ofthe child under the particular circumstances.   ---   UNWED FATHER granted custody of son after placement withadoptive family.   The ruling in a Palm Beach, Fla., court is unusual,lawyers say, because while unwed fathers frequently seek tochallenge adoption placements they seldom succeed. Judgesalmost never &quot;tear the kid out of an adoptive family,&quot; saidDavid Leavitt, an adoption lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif.   The Florida case arose after the infant's mother put himup for adoption. Glenn Mitchell, who represented the father,said the father knew his former girlfriend was pregnant buthadn't been informed that she was placing the child up foradoption. The father challenged the placement as soon as helearned of it, Mr. Mitchell said.   Bennett Cohn, who represents the private adoption agency,Chosen Children, said the agency will probably appeal.   The decision means that unwed mothers in Florida won't beable to place their children for adoption until they haveascertained whether the father wants a role in raising thechild, said Helen Tanos Hope, a Davie, Fla., adoption lawyer.</TEXT></DOC>
