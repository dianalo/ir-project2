U.S. military and diplomatic dependents and Panamanian foes ofthe regime under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge at U.S.military bases.   Bush ordered in about 1,900 troops Thursday after supporters ofNoriega, Panama's de facto leader, beat opposition candidates andattacked protesters accusing Noriega of stealing Sunday'spresidential election.   The Roman Catholic church harshly denounced the governmentFriday for the violence.   ``What moral justification can there be for terrorizing thepopulation with gangs feeding on hate and a false nationalism?''the church asked in an unusually strong statement.   The new U.S. troops augment approximately 10,400 troopersalready here. They will help defend the canal, provide security andassist in moving U.S. citizens if need be, said Col. RonaldSconyers, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command.   Panama said Friday it was suspending the start of school at alllevels because of violence and civil disobedience inspired by theUnited States and the political opposition.   Education Minister Rolando Murga decided to postpone classes forapproximately 600,000 public school and 60,000 university studentsfor ``reasons of physical safety,'' a government statement said.   Most classes here start May 22. Some have already started.   ``The deranged government of President Bush is now attemptingwith acts of violence and civil disobedience ... to destroy socialorder, peace, tranquillity and life,'' the statement said.   The government-controlled afternoon newspaper Ultimas Noticiasnamed Bush ``Bum of the Day,'' a regular front-page feature thatusually targets local opposition politicians.   The U.S. cargo jets landed at Howard Air Force Base, five mileswest of Panama City, at half hour intervals, bringing Marines fromCamp Lejeune, N.C., and soldiers from the 7th Light InfantryDivision at Fort Ord, Calif.   ``We are proud to be here,'' said Army brigade commander Col.David Hale.   Lt. Col. Jerry Humble, commander of the Second Light ArmoredInfantry Battalion, told reporters on the flight to Panama: ``Ithink we're going to be here until this is resolved.''   ``With what's going on down there any prudent American would beconcerned,'' said Humble, 41, of Owensboro, Ky.   Meanwhile, the opposition coalition, which claims a 3-1 victoryin Sunday's elections, thanked all governments, especially those inLatin America, that have protested fraud and violence.   It again offered to take part in a patriotic agreement thatwould get the country out from under Noriega's ``corrupt anddictatorial'' rule.   The pro-government presidential candidate said Panama'selections had been nullified because of U.S. interference.   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, who wasbeaten by pro-Noriega gangs on Wednesday, celebrated his 53rdbirthday at a hospital with presents and cake.   He was listed in good condition and high spirits Friday.   A U.S. military source said that since Monday more than 160Panamanians have been given refuge at U.S. military installations.   ``They are here because they have shown that they are inphysical danger for political reasons,'' said the source, whorefused to identify any of the Panamanians for fear of reprisals.   International condemnation of the election and the beatingscontinued to pour in Friday. Mexico withdrew its envoy forconsultations.   Nicaragua and the Soviet Union, however, condemned the dispatchof U.S. troops as interference.   In Washington, the Organization of American States permanentcouncil approved unanimously a Venezuelan proposal calling for OASforeign ministers to meet Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Panama.   In Panama City, most businesses returned to normal but theopposition reportedly considered more demonstrations.   There were backups at occasional Panamanian Defense Forcescheckpoints, where drivers' identifications were being checked.   Noriega's hand-picked candidate Carlos Duque said in a letter tothe people in the government-controlled press that the vote wasnullified because ``the U.S. government wanted to impose its choiceat all costs.''   Bush had sent a team of observers that said the governmentrigged the election.   At a news conference Thursday night all parties in thegovernment coalition publicly supported voiding the vote, whichhappened while they were well ahead in official totals.   International observers said tallies were being counterfeited tocheat the opposition of a 3-1 victory.   Noriega has not appeared in public since before Sunday'selection and has issued no statements on the breakdown of theelection process. He had gone into the elections seeking legitimacyfor the regime.   Reports said civilian government politicians had told Noriegathe cheating was too obvious to continue with any legitimacy.   There was no sign that discipline was breaking down in the armyor that unity was dissolving.   At U.S. military bases, schools were closed and all unofficialoff-base activities, from shopping to scuba diving, were canceled.   At the U.S. Embassy, where the U.S. staff was to be cut from 105to less than 50, staffers were waiting for more detailedinstructions on who would go and when.   Noriega is under federal drug indictments in Miami and Tampa,Fla., and denies the charges. He has been the de facto leader ofPanama since he took control of the military in 1983.   The U.S. imposed sanctions on Panama after Noriega engineeredthe ouster of President Eric Delvalle in February 1988. The U.S.government continues to recognize Delvalle instead of actingPresident Manuel Solis Palma.</TEXT></DOC>
