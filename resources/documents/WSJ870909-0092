Judge Bork is a former professor of law who has taught at Yale, one of our nation's most prestigious law schools; he is a prolific author of scholarly legal works and has had important practical experience as a litigator; he is a former solicitor general and is now a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.    A year ago, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) said that he would support Judge Bork for the Supreme Court. So why are Sen. Biden, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, and others now up in arms about Judge Bork? Some senators are talking about filibustering his nomination to death.    One of the criticisms leveled against Judge Bork is that he fired Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, in 1973. But it is important to get the facts straight. I remember the period very well, for I was then assistant majority counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee.    After our committee discovered the existence of the secret taping system, Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox subpoenaed the tapes. President Nixon wanted to end the investigation and ordered Attorney General Elliott Richardson to fire Mr. Cox, who had no independent statutory authority. Mr. Richardson resigned, refusing to follow the order, for it would violate a promise he had made to Congress. His deputy, William Ruckelshaus also refused, and Mr. Nixon fired him. Then Mr. Nixon turned to the person who was third in line, Solicitor General Bork. Judge Bork also did not want to carry out Mr. Nixon's order, but Mr. Richardson urged him to stay on the job so that the Justice Department would not be left headless. While this was going on, Mr. Cox's Watergate staff was planning to resign as a group. Mr. Cox urged them not to resign.    The problem with principled resignations is that they rob an organization of its most principled members. Messrs. Cox, Richardson and Bork understood this. Judge Bork stayed on as acting attorney general, did all he could to keep Mr. Cox's staff working without interruption, and opposed Mr. Nixon's efforts to compromise the investigation. Mr. Nixon eventually was forced to appoint a new special prosecutor, who found the staff intact, because the staff had also accepted the advice not to resign.    When senators such as Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) or Joseph Biden praise the present Supreme Court and express fear of another Republican appointee, they forget that they are praising a Republican court: Only two justices now on the Supreme Court have been appointed by the Democrats: Thurgood Marshall, a liberal appointed by President Johnson, and Byron White, a conservative appointed by President Kennedy.    Moreover, when senators try to predict how liberal or conservative a justice will be, they are often wrong. When Sandra Day O'Connor was nominated, she was considered by many as a right-wing ideologue; now she is regarded as moderate or liberal. After Harry Blackmun was appointed in 1970, Democrats and the media dubbed him and then-Chief Justice Warren Burger (both from Minnesota) &quot;the Minnesota Twins.&quot; Yet it soon became clear that they differed on many major issues.    Critics fear that Judge Bork will be &quot;too conservative&quot; on the Supreme Court. These critics seem to think that Supreme Court justices vote on the law the way politicians vote on legislation. But the justices are merely the custodians of the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton said in the Federalist Papers, the justices do not make the law, they interpret it; they exercise &quot;judgment,&quot; not &quot;will.&quot;    Some senators have suggested that they will not vote for Judge Bork unless he tells them how he will vote on particular cases or promises not to overturn certain cases. The senators can't constitutionally do that. Article III of the Constitution prohibits a nominee from giving advisory opinions. He may tell us that some opinions are drafted poorly (constitutional commentators have done that for years), but he can't say how he would decide particular issues. Nor can the senators attach any conditions to his appointment. An opinion of the U.S. attorney general made clear 150 years ago that senators cannot place any &quot;qualifications or alteration&quot; on an appointment.    Justice Joseph Story, an early-19th century Supreme Court justice, tells us in his influential &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution&quot; that senators may withhold &quot;their advice and consent from any candidate&quot; only if the candidate &quot;in their judgment does not possess due qualifications for office.&quot; Story acknowledges that the Senate may act &quot;from party motives, from a spirit of opposition,&quot; but he hoped that &quot;such occurrences will be rare.&quot;    Let us hope that in Judge Bork's confirmation hearing we will not be witness to one of those rare occurrences.    ---   Mr. Rotunda is a professor of law at the University of Illinois. </TEXT></DOC>
