Gen. ArturoEnrile, head of the Philippine Military Academy who lednegotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders. ``The problemis already finished.''   However, rebels who marched the 1\ miles back to nearby FortBonifacio were smiling, chanting ``No surrender, the fight goeson!'' Soldiers at the army base there unfurled a white sheet at thegate saying, ``Welcome Home.''   Rebels still held Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south ofManila. However, local officials Thursday were trying to arrangetalks there to end the occupation at the last known rebelstronghold.   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 otherswounded since the coup began Friday.   Mrs. Aquino, who faced the gravest crisis of her 3{-year-oldadministration, expressed relief that the siege was over.   ``I would also like to commend those who helped to bring aboutthis end to urban terrorism,'' she said in a written statement.``We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources torebuild what has been destroyed.''   Thursday's announcement came one day after 1,800 foreigners,including about 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-heldluxury hotels in Makati and Mrs. Aquino declared a national stateof emergency.   As the rebels left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized lastSaturday, the atmosphere seemed more one of victory than defeat.   The mutineers, rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers ofammunition slung over their shoulders, sang the theme song of theirScout Ranger unit as they marched to Fort Bonifacio.   ``We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. Danilo Lim.``We have made a very strong statement.'' As the mutineers marchedpast the exclusive Forbes Park neighborhood, where U.S. AmbassadorNicholas Platt lives, some residents stood on the street andcheered.   ``I would like to say that the soldiers are voluntarilyreturning to barracks,'' Lim told reporters as he left Makati. ``Wedid not surrender.''   Rebel spokesman Capt. Albert Yen said, ``We are willing to facethe consequences of our acts, but the fight must go on.''   Scout ranger Cpl. Roy Bantung, another mutineer, said: ``We willnot surrender, even if it takes forever. The government mustchange. Cory must change her policies.'' He was using PresidentAquino's nickname.   The government agreed the rebels will be treated ``humanely,justly and fairly,'' Enrile said. But he added they would ``sufferthe consequences'' for launching the sixth coup attempt againstMrs. Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.   He did not elaborate. Most rebel officers in past coup attemptshave simply been confined to barracks, and many enlisted men weresent back into the ranks. Some rebels have been charged but beenacquitted or given light sentences.   Rebels agreed about midnight to give up, Enrile said. ``We allagreed that if they returned to the barracks ... it would be goodfor the nation as a whole.''   He added that the rebels' political demands, which included theresignation of Mrs. Aquino, ``were non-negotiable.''   The rebels seized hotels and buildings in the financial areaSaturday on the second day of their coup attempt.   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flw air cover for loyalistforces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents fromcontinuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized thebase in the first hours of the coup.   Rebel leaders said the uprising was codenamed ``Seven Days andSeven Nights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stageoperation. The leaders said the takeover of the financial districtwas the second stage.   President Aquino early Wednesday evoked the ``people power''revolution in appealing for support against mutinous soldiers benton overthrowing her government.   ``I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake fordemocracy; I have lost my husband,'' Mrs. Aquino said in anationally televised address, appearing tired.   ``Why did I become president? It was because you believed in me,and in spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me''against enemies who want ``to kill me ... so that they can rule ourland,'' she said.   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in 1983 ashe arrived from self-imposed exile in the United States tochallenge President Ferdinand E. Marcos. She took his place as theopposition presidential candidate and was swept into office by apopular uprising. Marcos went into exile in Hawaii.   After her speech Wednesday, the government announced that Mrs.Aquino had proclaimed a national state of emergency, giving herbroad powers to cope with the rebellion launched Friday bythousands of soldiers.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theevacuation was managed without incident, and ``all Americans werereported safe and we have no reports of injuries.''   After the evacuation, rebel and army representatives began talkson ending the rebellion. Sporadic sniping resumed, but thecease-fire generally held through the day.   It was unclear what new powers Mrs. Aquino would have. Cabinetofficials insisted personal liberties would not be curtailed, butsaid special powers were needed to deal with the economic andsocial crisis caused by the coup.   Public confidence has been shaken far more than by any of thefive other coup attempts.   Jose Fernandez, governor of the Central Bank, said Wednesday twobillion pesos ($91 million) had been withdrawn in runs on Manilabanks the past two days and many parts of the archipelago had cashshortages because domestic air service had been suspended.   Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon said: ``This is not martial law.There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of habeascorpus. Congress will continue. We will continue to enjoy ourrights. It only empowers government to check those who may not bedelivering basic services.''   Rep. Salvador Britannico, an opposition legislator, said theemergency declaration would discourage foreign investment and was``a first step ... toward the declaration of martial law.''   Adolfo Azcuna, the government press secretary, said officialsplanned to take control of utilities and transport. JosephinaLichaoco, chairman of the National Telecommunications Commission,said new media guidelines would be issued.   Among other things, she said, they would forbid the broadcast of``rebellious terrorist propaganda'' comments and interviews, and``strategic information'' such as troop movements, weapons andnumbers of soldiers.   In her television address, Mrs. Aquino urged Filipinos to fillthe streets Friday in the same demonstration of ``people power''that forced the late President Marcos into exile.   ``It is very clear that these people want to kill me, toeliminate me, so that they can rule our land,'' she said.   ``What they have forgotten is, power is not theirs to take. Theycannot just grab power by killing people. They have to understand,power belongs to you, my beloved countrymen.''   The rebels have demanded Mrs. Aquino resign in favor of acoalition that would hold a referendum on a new government. Theyaccuse her of ignoring corruption, refusing to make social andeconomic reform and failing to crush the Communist insurgency thatbegan a generation ago under Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
