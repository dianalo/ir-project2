The utility said Heber Binary Project's heat suppliers, Unocal Corp. and the Chevron Geothermal Co. of California unit of Chevron Corp., had fallen two years behind on drilling the wells because of problems in the brine supply at the site. This delay in drilling could add nearly $20 million to the cost of the project and cause it to run out of funds before the drilling is completed, a San Diego Gas spokesman said. The utility said the plant had been operating inefficiently at current low brine levels.    San Diego Gas, which is managing the project for 10 other partners, said it terminated the subcontracts with Chevron and Unocal, and is renegotiating the project with them. The plant was operating at half of its 45,000-kilowatt capacity, the spokesman said.    A Chevron spokesman said the companies were holding discussions, but hadn't been told the contracts were terminated. Unocal officials weren't immediately available for comment.    The research and development project is the largest geothermal project in the state, the San Diego Gas spokesman said. The plant extracts hot brine from the earth, which is used to heat secondary fluids to power a turbine to provide electricity; the brine is then reinjected into the ground. </TEXT></DOC>
