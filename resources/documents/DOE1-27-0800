<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0800 </DOCNO><TEXT>Prior to the development of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3 (NPR-3) beginningin 1976 all the natural gas produced on the reserve was consumed by fieldoperation related to oil production. Due to the development of NPR-3,oil production has increased substantially which increased the productionof associated natural gas far beyond the volume required to sustain operationof the field. Presently, four-million cubic feet of gas per day is beinginjected into the gas cap of the Second Wall Creek formation. This injectionof gas is being used to maintain the reservior pressure of the SecondWall Creek formation. Upon completion of a Low Temperature SeparationPlant (LTS), gas production will be increased to approximately eight-millioncubic feet of gas per day. The LTS Plant will remove approximately 14,000gallons of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) from the gas stream in a residuegas volume of 7.36 million cubic feet per day. This is anticipated tobe approximately 3.36 MMCF more than required to maintain the pressureof the Second Wall Creek formation. The means of disposing of this surplusgas, would be to sell it to a gas related company. This document is anassessment of the environmental impacts resulting from the installationof a gas sales pipeline. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
