Sandamp;P said the move reflects the decline in the Rocky Mountain economy that is resulting in higher unemployment and reduced tax revenue, among other things.    Included in the downgrade are $381.5 million of Denver's general obligation bonds and $155 million of Metropolitan Denver Sewerage District 1 subordinate bonds, backed by Denver. Both were cut to double-A from triple-A.    About $20 million of certificates of participation were lowered to single-A from double-A, and $67 million of excise tax revenue bonds were downgraded to single-A from single-A-plus.    Thomas P. Briggs, Denver's revenue manager and chief financial officer, said, &quot;Obviously, the city is disappointed. Nevertheless, we recognize the validity of their concerns.&quot; He said the double-A grade is still a high quality rating and that he doesn't expect Sandamp;P's action to have any major impact on the city's financings. </TEXT></DOC>
