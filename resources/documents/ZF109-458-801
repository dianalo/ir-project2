(NTT) in July.andP;  The company reported it had developed a newoptical-memory material that can retrieve data at super-high speeds, some 100million times faster than existing optical-storage materials.andP;  A12-centimeter compact disk of the material, which uses an opto-chemicallyinduced, hole-burning method for data storage, can store about 1000 timesmore data than conventional disks.andP;  The material is a mix of high-purityplastics, normally used to make eyeglasses (tetraphenylporphine and acompound contained in coal).andM;To date, an estimated 100 companies have entered the magneto-optical diskmarket.andP;  Those entering the optical media or disk-drive fields includeJapanese chemical and textile companies and high-tech firms such asMatsushita Electric Industrial Co., Cannon Inc Ricoh Co., Sony, Fujitsu,Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp., and Toshiba Corp. Their combined Randamp;D spending ontechnology is estimated by industry sources at more than 100 billion yen(US$667 million).andM;For example, Daicel Chemical Industries recently started a plant that mayeventually be able to produce one million rewritable optical media disksannually.andP;  Ricoh, among others, believes rewritable optical disks will bestandard equipment on personal computers in four to five years.andP;  Some firms,like Pioneer, are buying into technology through overseas acquisitions.andO;Pioneer, which has its own laser-disk know-how, recently bought DiscoVisionAssociates, a US company that holds the basic patent for optical disks.andM;Though optical technology holds much promise, Fujitsu and other companiesbelieve magnetic disks will remain mainstay storage devices that dominate themarket for some time to come.andP;  Fujitsu is focusing on improving magnetic-diskperformance using solid-state disk technology and caching; the company plansto introduce an SSD drive soon, but Hasegawa predicts that it will beexpensive.andM;Hasegawa explained that although his company's 51/4-inch hard disk drives arethe most popular items on the Japanese market now, a subsystem solution willbe required in the future to provide adequate disk storage for UNIX systems.andO;The current drives have an embedded small computer-systems interface (SCSI)or an SCSI-II and a buffer memory.andP;  &quot;A subsystem solution is needed for UNIXbecause of the big drivers required and because the memory must be embeddedin the drive side rather than in the software side.&quot; That will meanhigh-capacity disks in subsystems, such as a disk-array type of product.andP;  Butit is too early now to use that kind of array for UNIX systems because theprice is too high.andP;  Fujitsu has a leg up on subsystem development through itsownership of Intellistor, an Intelligent-subsystem manufacturer based inLongmont, CO, that it bought in 1987.andM;Hasegawa expects one future trend to be the downsizing of clusters of largedisks.andP;  For example, in one cabinet Fujitsu now can fit 30 GB of 8-inch diskdrives in the same amount of space taken by 7.5 GB of 10-1/2-inch drives.andM;Among Fujitsu's other recent developments: an 8-inch drive with six paralleltracks that transfer data at a combined rate of 19 MB per second, one of thefastest speeds in the industry.andP;  The price: $10,000.andP;  Demand for the drivehas been restricted to vertical markets, such as graphic-image storage forhospitals and medical corporations.andP;  When introduced in April 1989, the drivebroke an industry speed record for disk-transfer rate, just as the company's8-inch Winchester, introduced at the same time, broke the 2-GB storage and15-ms access-time barriers.andM;Fujitsu expects some equally impressive developments in storage technology inthe future.andP;  It predicts track density will increase from the current 30,000bpi to 50,000 bpi by the early 1990s, and to 100,000 by about 1996.andP;  Magnetichard-disk media will shift from ferrous oxide to metal-sputtered thin film,and heads will change from ferrite to inductive thin film by the early 1990s.andO;Eventually, around 1995, Fujitsu expects magneto-resistive heads to hit themarket.andP;  By then the flying height will have diminished from the current 0.2or 0.1 micrometers to 0.05 micrometers.andM;Storage densities will emulate the development breakthrough recentlyannounced by IBM Japan Ltd.-that is, one gigabit of data stored on one squareinch of a magnetic disk.andP;  Hasegawa thinks that such technology should becomecommon during the 21st century, and moves toward that goal will be apparentsoon.andP;  &quot;We will see a 500-MB hard-disk drive the size of a matchbox withinabout three years, and it may even be a plug-in,&quot; he projects.andP;  IBM Japan hasalready announced a 3 1/2-inch hard-disk drive with 500 MB of storage.andM;IBM announced the one-gigabit storage breakthrough last December.andP;  Therecording density, 15 to 30 times that of current hard-disk drives, wasachieved using experimental components, such as thin-film recording heads.andO;IBM expects it will take several years before one-gigabit technology can beincorporated into products, though it said all the critical hardwarecomponents for the drive were made by conventional manufacturing processes.andO;IBM performed a demonstration of the technology in December at its AlmadenResearch Center in San Jose, CA, which collaborated with the company'sResearch and General Products Divisions.andM;The experimental dual-element, thin-film recording head used in thedemonstration incorporated both an inductive write element and amagneto-resistive read element.andP;  Both elements were in operation while thehead flew over the disk at a height of less than two millionths of an inch.andO;Current drives have heads flying at 6 to 15 millionths of an inch above thedisk surface.andM;The magneto-resistive head used in the demonstration is similar to the oneused in IBM's 3480 magnetic subsystem since 1984.andP;  But in the demonstrationthe recorded tracks were more than 100 times narrower than those in the 3480.andO;To achieve this track decrease, IBM had to redesign the head, which iscomposed of several layers of very thin films and made by photolithographmethods common in the semiconductor industry.andP;  The drive used an aluminumdisk coated with a thin film of magnetic cobalt alloy, which holds therecorded bits.andP;  During the gigabit demonstration, information was recordedand read at 3.5 million bytes per second.andM;Even before such high-tech drives hit the market, Japanese disk makers aremoving forward with a technology evolved from the record industry: compactdisc, read only memory  (CD-ROM) drives.andM;Sony made the headlines in May when it announced its Data Discman, a CD-ROM&quot;walking dictionary.&quot; The portable data-retrieval system can accessinformation from catalogs, dictionaries, and other sources on a 3-inch CD-ROMdisc and show it on a liquid-crystal display.andP;  The 58,000-yen (US$387)product went on the market in July along with 18 different CD-ROM softwareprograms including travel guides, textbooks, and instruction manuals.andO;Data-retrieval software is contained in an internal integrated circuit.andP;  TheDiscman comes with a 26-character Roman alphabet keyboard and a screendisplaying 16 horizontal characters on 10 lines.andP;  It can also play 3-inchaudio CDs.andP;  The entire product, which fits into a person's palm, measuresabout 4' x weighs one pound without battery pack.andM;This technology is part of Sony's multimedia-system strategy, in which CDplayers can be hooked to a stereo or a computer.andP;  Currently, Sony has sold300,000 5-inch CD-ROM drives as computer peripherals.andP;  According to industryanalysts, the Discman, which is more a standalone system than a peripheral,is doing better than projected sales estimates, but no actual figures wereavailable at time of writing.andP;  Sony, however, says the Discman will not beused for UNIX systems in the future because of its access rate.andM;To date, CD-ROM technology, like its optical-disk cousin, is noted for itsslow data-access rate in retrieving information at random.andP;  It's so slowbecause it is based on a CD audio standard set by Philips and Sony in 1982.andO;But there's nothing to prevent CD-ROMs from operating four to five times thespeed of today's models,&quot; says Jim Parker, president of DataflowInternational Inc., a Yokohama consulting company.andP;  Indeed, Sony, Matsushita,Microsoft, and other companies are working on a new standard that would speedup CD-ROMs.andP;  Parker adds that although today's CD-ROM drives are limited to660 MB of storage, that could be expanded four times if the laser LEDtechnology is developed to pick up all the signals.andP;  UNIX applications forspeedier and denser CD-ROMs may emerge, he predicts.andM;Where UNIX is finding a role in the CD-ROM business is in software-authoringsystems.andP;  Tiger Media of Los Angeles is about to release CD software thatwill run on Sun Sparc workstations.andP;  Parker says the company used UNIX todevelop the software.andP;  Japan's Microboard makes an authoring system aimed atdeveloping compact disc-interactive (CDI) software.andP;  It is a UNIX-basedengineering workstation that is being used by, among others, AmericanInteractive Media, a US-based Philips company responsible for developing CDItitles.andP;  Parker says UNIX is a natural for CDI development because the CDIoperates on the Motorola 68000 CPU.andP;  Another UNIX-based authoring system isbeing sold by Japan's Query.andM;CDI technology is still just getting off the ground.andP;  In London, Sonydemonstrated a prototype CDI player called CDI Ready which is similar inconcept to the Discman; CDI Ready may be released next summer.andP;  Designedprimarily for playing music, CDI players can access an extra track on arecord for another 10 minutes of interactive playing.andP;  Such technologies arepaving the way to the powerful multimedia systems of the future, an area inwhich Japan, armed with storage-technology and downsizing expertise, isalready taking the lead.andM;Lori Valigra, UNIX REVIEW's correspondent in Japan, filed this report fromTokyo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
