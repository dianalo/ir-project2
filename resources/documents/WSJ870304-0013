Postscript, which also is licensed to Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., and Wang Laboratories Inc., enables users of minicomputers and microcomputers to set type and graphics on a video screen and transform it directly into finished printed copy on a laser printer connected to the computer. Called a page description language interpreter, Postscript tells a printer how to replicate the images on the screen.    The agreement underscores IBM's interest in incorporating sophisticated graphics and typesetting capabilities similar to Apple's Macintosh personal computers in its new personal computer products anticipated in coming months. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Xerox Corp. offer competing page description language interpreters, but Postscript is the most widely used.    The agreement with IBM set off a flurry of trading in Adobe stock yesterday, as nearly 300,000 shares changed hands. The stock closed at $51, up $5.25, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
