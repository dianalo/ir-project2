Friday sweetened its bidagain for American Standard Inc. to $77 per share, or about $2.4billion cash, one day after the plumbing conglomerate's boardapproved a $78-per-share leveraged buyout.   ``We believe that our offer of $77 in the light of timing andprobability of payment (from the leveraged buyout) represents abetter choice for American Standard stockholders,'' Black andamp; DeckerChairman Nolan B. Archibald said in a statement.   American Standard, which has fought Black andamp; Decker's bid fornearly two months, said after a marathon board meeting Thursdaythat it would recommend its stockholders accept a $2.45 billioncash offer led by Kelso andamp; Co., a New York investment banking firmspecializing in employee-led leveraged buyouts.   The Kelso buyout plan _ under which an employee stock ownershipplan, or ESOP, would acquire 20 percent of the company _ toppedBlack andamp; Decker's previous bid of $73 a share, or $2.3 billion.   Stephen F. Page, Black andamp; Decker's treasurer and vice presidentfor finance, said officials of the Towson, Md.-based tool andappliance maker were confident they could acquire AmericanStandard. But he indicated they were reaching their limit.   ``It's always tough to say never,'' Page said. ``But I don't seewhat would be there to make us go higher. I just have a hard timeseeing anything there.''   American Standard spokeswoman Lois Stewart said the companywould have no comment.   Black andamp; Decker initially proposed a buyout at $65 a share, latersweetening its bid to $68 and finally to $73, before making itslatest bid.   American Standard fell 50 cents to close at $75.87{ a share onthe New York Stock Exchange Friday. Black andamp; Decker closed at$20.62{, up $1.12{ a share.   American Standard has about 31.5 million common sharesoutstanding.   Black andamp; Decker's bid came despite analysts' speculation Thursdaythat the bidding war for American Standard was over, citing thesize of the premium Kelso was offering over the market price.   But Black andamp; Decker said it hiked the bid again ``after reviewingthe information supplied by American Standard (and) after a duediligence session with American Standard management.''   Black andamp; Decker also cited a Delaware court ruling on Tuesday``invalidating the golden parachute and pension fund lock-up putinto place by American Standard after Black andamp; Decker commenced itsoffer.''   Archibald said the action of the court ``would have justified anadditional increase, but we have to take into account the break-upfees and other costs that American Standard has incurred since thedate of that decision.''   Black andamp; Decker set midnight March 31 as an expiration date forits tender offer.   American Standard, a maker of plumbing and air conditioningequipment, said its definitive agreement with Kelso is subject toKelso obtaining necessary financing.   American Standard said Kelso planned to finance the deal througha $1.8 billion loan to be syndicated by Bankers Trust Co.; a $900million short-term ``bridge'' loan from First Boston SecuritiesCorp., an affiliate of the investment bank; and $250 million ofcommon equity from Kelso and certain institutional investors.   Kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stockownership plans, or ESOPs, a concept it pioneered about 30 yearsago.   The company added it expected a newly formed ESOP would acquireabout 20 percent of American Standard's common shares.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely throughborrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or sale ofassets. ESOPs also are financed mostly with borrowed funds, butequity is divided among all of the company's workers rather thanjust a few investors.   Ms. Stewart said American Standard, which repeatedly rejectedBlack andamp; Decker's earlier overtures, had received several offers butshe refused to identify the bidders.   Page said Black andamp; Decker plans to sell American Standard'stransportation division.   Under the Kelso offer, American Standard's management likelywould remain largely intact but the company might be forced to sellits transportation division and New York headquarters to helpreduce debt incurred in the buyout.</TEXT></DOC>
