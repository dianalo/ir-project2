SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration, which just a year ago was busy trying to build bridges to Iran, now has to consider whether it wants to burn them.    And bridges surely will be burned if the administration reacts as many here and abroad think it must to the firing of what apparently was an Iranian missile into a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker late last week.    Even though the strike took place in Kuwaiti waters and didn't involve American forces, American policy makers may think they have little choice but to take some kind of military action against Iran. America's friends in the region apparently want a response. And American credibility in the gulf, slowly on the rise because of the administration's willingness to give U.S. Navy escorts to Kuwaiti tankers, may fall again if the U.S. doesn't act.    But while inaction might have its costs, the U.S. also must consider the immense long-term implications of a direct military strike against Iran. &quot;If the U.S. gets in the position of killing Iranians, it will take {the Iranians} 35 to 50 years to forget it,&quot; says James A. Bill, an Iran watcher at the College of William and Mary.    Iran is, in many ways, the prize of the Persian Gulf. It has rich reserves of oil and natural gas, a strategic location and triple the population of any other gulf country. If the U.S. attacks this important land, Mr. Bill predicts three far-reaching results:    --Inside the Iranian political system, an attack &quot;would swing the pendulum in the direction of extremism and lock it in place for years.&quot; Pragmatic leaders, the very people the administration courted in its secret arms deals, would be discredited, and more-radical leaders would see their stature enhanced.    --The door would be open wider to Soviet influence in Tehran.    --Iranian-sponsored terrorism and unconventional warfare would flare up all along the Persian Gulf, where the other nations generally are friendly to the U.S.    Indeed, the U.S. would have to be prepared to accept the burden of protecting its friends in the region from a newly enraged Iran, a burden it would implicitly assume if it struck. &quot;If we are getting ourselves increasingly seen as the guarantors of the various regimes in the region against the Iranian threat, that has all sorts of implications,&quot; says Ruhollah Ramazani, a Middle East scholar at the University of Virginia.    For Americans, the most difficult task might be to take the long view, and understand how the Iranians would view a military strike against them. To U.S. policy makers and most of the public, a strike now would be seen as a simple, justifiable tit-for-tat response to a clear Iranian provocation.    But within Iran, a U.S. attack would be seen as another example of what a recent study by the Foreign Policy Institute of Johns Hopkins University calls &quot;the myth of U.S. domination of Iran during the decades before the {1979} Islamic revolution.&quot; And there are ample historical reasons for Iranians to accept the myth. After all, the Central Intelligence Agency engineered a coup in 1953 that restored the shah after he had lost power to a faction less friendly to American interests.    Against this backdrop, Iranian leaders can portray the mere presence of American warships in the Persian Gulf as a realistic threat to Iran's sovereignty. If the U.S. conducts even a limited strike now, Iranians will have a far harder time keeping the action in perspective than Americans will.    Despite the recent twists that have the U.S. and Iran on the verge of open confrontation, the fact remains that for more than six years, the U.S. concluded that its long-term interests were best served by a posture of careful neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war. U.S officials who are pondering retaliation now are considering whether they want to abandon the neutrality that seemed wise not so long ago. </TEXT></DOC>
