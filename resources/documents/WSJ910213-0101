It wasn't that Mr. Toobinspilled any grand-jury or national-security secrets; as theJustice and State departments said, there are none in&quot;Opening Arguments.&quot; It wasn't even that Mr. Toobin declaredthe innocence of people Mr. Walsh has kept under a cloud fornearly four years. No, the reason is that this first insideaccount of the Walsh operation makes clear that itsprosecutorial abuses were more awful than even its critics --say, those of us on this newspaper's editorial page-everimagined.   Mr. Toobin's book offers precisely what the subtitlepromises, &quot;A Young Lawyer's First Case, United States v.Oliver North.&quot; It begins with sugarplums dancing in Mr.Toobin's imagination: As a youth, &quot;I developed the disdainfor Richard Nixon that was all but obligatory on the UpperWest Side of Manhattan.&quot; He idolized the Watergateprosecutors, recalling, &quot;To my eyes it looked less like a jobthan a crusade -- and I wanted to join the next one.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   He got his wish when he joined Mr. Walsh's staff soonafter graduating from Harvard Law School. &quot;The Walsh officewould take on Reagan and all the president's men,&quot; he wrote.&quot;We had nothing less than a blank check to uncover andrectify the misdeeds of a corrupt and dishonorableadministration. We wouldn't stop until we reached the top.&quot;   Mr. Toobin's liberalism survived his experience at Walsh andamp;Co., but he also emerged with the lesson that a politicalsystem enamored with &quot;independent counsels&quot; needs to learn.He wrote that prosecutors who criminalize &quot;honestdisagreements, policy tussles and close calls&quot; jeopardize&quot;the whole edifice of the law.&quot;   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh might ask himself if Mr.Walsh deserves to become a permanent government agency. Mr.Walsh has plenty of questions to answer, which perhaps hewill tackle in the book on the case that he told Mr. Toobinhe plans to write:                                                                                                          Why didn't Mr. Walsh heed the warnings of staffers againstfiling unsupportable charges?   Mr. Toobin describes a split within Mr. Walsh's officebetween inexperienced prosecutors who wanted a broad,political prosecution and more experienced prosecutors whowanted to know if any clear crimes had been committed. Hequotes Walsh aide Robert Shwartz as saying, &quot;This is acriminal case, and the Boland amendment is not a criminallaw.&quot; As the excerpts on the previous page show, the responsefrom the boss, breathtaking for a prosecutor, was that Mr.Walsh knew he was &quot;right morally,&quot; even if he'd have a &quot;toughtime legally.&quot; Mr. Walsh went ahead with the broadestcharges, which were eventually dismissed.                                                                                                          Why did Mr. Walsh fail to follow legal requirements onclassified information before bringing the charges?   The law on using classified materials in criminal casesrequires prosecutors to consult with intelligence agencies toavoid spilling secrets. Mr. Toobin writes that &quot;we had failedto anticipate our classified information problems&quot; and that,&quot;We never sought permission from the intelligence agenciesfor where we could pursue our mandate.&quot; When classifiedmaterial was blocked from the courtroom, judges dismissed thebroad charges against Oliver North and John Poindexter andthe entire case against former CIA official Joseph Fernandez.                                                                                                          Why did Mr. Walsh use testimony and evidence that Congresshad granted immunity?   After Mr. North and others endured trials, a federalappeals court reversed all of Mr. North's convictions (andprobably will reverse Mr. Poindexter's) because Mr. Walshused immunized testimony. The law requires that prosecutorsprove that any information they used came from a source otherthan compelled testimony. Mr. Toobin describes how the Walshteam argued that immunity is limited to narrow answers, notthe full explanations Mr. North gave in his congressionaltestimony. Mr. Toobin writes &quot;the press ate this brief up,&quot;though prosecutors &quot;never seriously expected that JudgeGerhard Gesell would ultimately rule that any part of North'stestimony was not immunized.&quot; This argument was so silly thatHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe called to complain.   There were other frivolous legal arguments. If any of thedefendants had been pardoned early in the process, Mr. Walshwas prepared to argue that it was unconstitutional to pardonbefore indictments -- despite President Ford's precedent withMr. Nixon. Mr. Toobin was even asked to look into whetherthey could use RICO against Mr. North with the NationalSecurity Council as a &quot;racketeering enterprise.&quot; This was onelegal abuse Mr. Walsh didn't pursue.   Mr. Toobin, now a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, doesn'tsay so directly, but his description offers insights into whythis imploded into a Keystone Kops prosecution. For onething, there may have been too many cooks for this thinbroth. Mr. Toobin refers to a hand-lettered sign posted by anFBI agent assigned to work with the Walsh staff. It washeaded &quot;Investigation Priorities&quot; and read:   1. Hire more lawyers.   2. Please the press.   3. Please the Congress.   4. Hire more lawyers.   There was also a political tilt among the Walsh staff. Mr.Toobin recalls how the &quot;political orientation&quot; shiftedslightly when a new staff member joined who &quot;was, in short,just what the office needed: a Republican who looked it.&quot;   Mr. Toobin's politics drove part of the case. &quot;I undertookthe investigation of Elliott Abrams with an enthusiasm thatbordered on the unseemly,&quot; he writes. Former AssistantSecretary of State Abrams gave hostile congressmen vagueanswers to questions about soliciting aid for the Contrasfrom countries such as Brunei. Although Mr. Toobin decidedthere was no crime, he still thinks Mr. Abrams was&quot;dissembling.&quot; After reading the chapter devoted to him, Mr.Abrams said, &quot;I was never taught in law school thatdefamation is supposed to be a prosecutor's stock in trade.&quot;Mr. Walsh still has not announced that he's cleared Mr.Abrams.   There was also a kind of political naivete in the passionto criminalize Iran-Contra. Mr. Toobin notes the argumentthat many people knew about White House efforts to help theContras (though not about the diversion of funds from Iranianarms sales), but &quot;everyone was pretending only North wasinvolved.&quot; Mr. Toobin writes that trial Judge Gesell thoughtthat Rep. Lee Hamilton, a top witness for the prosecution,knew at the time how deeply Mr. North was involved, but&quot;lacked the political will to protest.&quot;   Mr. Toobin still considers U.S. policy in Central Americaduring the 1980s &quot;reprehensible&quot; and thinks Mr. North's freesecurity fence for his home is somehow an outrage. Still, heends the book with an important lesson: &quot;Only crimes arecrimes.&quot; He wonders if any young people watched Mr. Walsh'steam the same way &quot;I once gaped at the Watergate prosecutors,and marveled at our invincibility.&quot; He responds: &quot;I doubt it.And that is okay with me.&quot;   (See related editorial &quot;Walsh Aide: `Were We Abusing OurPower?'&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 13, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
