The lightweight, wallet-sized phones will use high-frequencymicrowave signals to connect telephones over short distances, suchas in office buildings or within neighborhoods.   The new systems, known as personal communications networks,could be connected with PCNs in other cities to provide nationwidecommunications. PCN owners would need dial only a code to let thesystem know where they are at any time, said J. Shelby Bryan,chairman of Millicom Inc., a New York-based international cellularcompany.   Shelby said a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., willconduct a two-year test of the system in the Texas and Floridacities. The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approvedthe experiment.   Company spokeswoman Andrea Van Raalte said the test would beginsometime in the next two years.   Officials at American Personal Communications Inc. earlier thisyear received FCC permission to test a similar type of phone, butwhich would be unable to receive calls, in the Washington area. Thecompany has said when it hopes to begin testing next year.   Because of the short range of high-frequency microwave signals _as little as 600 feet _ the PCN, unlike regular cellular service,will be able to share space with other private microwave users.   This feature greatly increases the system's capacity _ and itsattractiveness to businesses that may find PCNs more convenient touse in an office building than wired systems.   A large number of users in small areas would greatly lower thecost of the phone units _ perhaps to $100 or less, Bryan said.   ``We can basically have many more subscribers per network so ourcost per subscriber will be lower,'' Bryan said in a telephoneinterview.   Officials at American Personal Communications told TheWashington Post they hoped the phones ultimately would cost $50 to$75.   The phones also will use much less power than cellular ones, andshould have battery lives of up to a week, Bryan said.   ``I fundamentally believe that PCNs are going to be the firstserious means of competition for local communications,'' an ATandamp;Tofficial, Richard B. Snyder, was quoted as saying in Thursday'seditions of The New York Times.   Bryan commented:   ``We'll always have copper (wire) communications, but I thinkit's going to be viewed over time as kind of an old-fashionedtechnology. ... I think we will be in direct competition tocellular.''   Cellular phones use a few large radio towers to transmit callsacross what are known as ``cells'' in a metropolitan area. Theequipment automatically passes off calls as a caller in anautomobile, for instance, passes from cell to cell.   The PCN system will rely on refrigerator-sized, low-powertransmitters that will transmit across a more limited area. Likeexisting cellular telephones, the new service will be able to``pass off'' phone calls as users move from one transmitter area toanother.   The British government already has selected three consortia tobuild nationwide PCN systems in Britain. Millicom is one of theconsortia; service is expected to begin there by 1993.   ``We envision that by the turn of the century ... 25 percent ofthe population of England will be on some form of radiotelephone,'' Bryan said.</TEXT></DOC>
