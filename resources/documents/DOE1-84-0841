The UNK structureand parameters have been chosen with consideration for operation in bothacceleration and colliding beam modes. The project envisages the followingoperational modes: acceleration of protons up to 3 TeV for fixed-targetexperiments; 0.4 x 3 TeV p-p colliding beams enabling to attain the 2.2TeV energy in the c.m.s.; further increase of colliding beam energy upto 6 TeV in the c.m.s. A possibility to have p-p-tilde collisions hasalso been considered. Preliminary studies have shown that with the existingU-70 used as the injector, the luminosity reached in p-p collisions maybe as large as 10/sup 32/ cm/sup -2/sec/sup -1/ and the one reached inp-p-tilde collisions about 10/sup 30/ cm/sup -2/sec/sup -1/. Figure 1shows the lattice of UNK. Four matched straight sections, MSS 2,3,5,6,each 490 m long will be used for colliding beam physics. Matched straightsections 1 and 4 are each 800 m long. The phase advances within the insertionare 4{pi} in both directions. MSS 1 will house the equipment for injection,acceleration, beam loss absorption and abort systems. Extraction willbe carried out from MSS 4 containing the relevant equipment and elementsto protect the superconducting magnets against irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
