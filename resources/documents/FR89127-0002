The bilateral agreementprovides, in part, for U.S. acceptance of certification by the DGAC thatthe Model A320 complies with the applicable U.S. laws, regulations andrequirements, or with the applicable French laws, regulations and requirements,plus any additional requirements the U.S. finds necessary to ensure thatthe Model A320 meets a level of safety equivalent to that provided by theapplicable U.S. laws, regulations and requirements. The DGAC has electedto certify that the Model A320 complies with the French laws, regulationsand requirements, plus any necessary special requirements.The DGAC has advised that the French laws, regulations and requirementsapplicable to the Model A320 (i.e. the French type certification basis)consist of JAR-25 with changes 1 through 11 thereto and including the FrenchNational Variants, Joint Airworthiness Requirements-All Weather Operation(JAR-AWO), and Special Conditions and interpretations applied specificallyto the Model A320. JAR-25 is a document developed jointly and acceptedby the airworthiness authorities of various European countries, includingFrance, for type certification of large airplanes. JAR-25 is based on Part25 of the FAR, however there are certain specified differences in the requirementsof the two documents. In addition, JAR-25 also contains requirements, knownas National Variants, that are peculiar to individual accepting countries.``Orange Papers'' are interim amendments which are eventually consolidatedas a change to JAR-25. Special conditions are also applied where JAR-25does not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards due to novelor unusual design features. In order to preclude confusion, these specialconditions will be referred to herein as the ``French Special Conditions.''JAR-AWO contains additional requirements applicable to all weather operations.The Airworthiness Authorities of Germany, England, and the Netherlandsparticipated with France in a joint certification of the A320 in February1988. U.S. type certification of the A320 is scheduled for December 15,1988.Based on the February 7, 1984, date of application for type certificate,the applicable U.S. laws, regulations and requirements, as establishedunder the provisions of andSection;andSection; 21.17 and 21.29 of the FAR,are Part 25 of the FAR with Amendments 25-1 through 25-56 thereto and thespecial conditions contained herein. When the applicable regulations donot contain adequate or appropriate safety standards because of a novelor unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under theprovisions of andSection; 21.16 of the FAR in order to establish a levelof safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.A comparison has been made of the French type certification basis and theabove noted U.S. laws, regulations and requirements, including the respectiveFrench and U.S. special conditions. Based on this comparison, the FAA hasprescribed the additional requirements that are necessary to ensure thatthe Model A320 meets a level of safety equivalent to that provided by theU.S. laws, regulations and requirements.Noise certification is beyond the scope of the bilateral agreement; however,French test data are accepted by separate arrangement. The French noisecertification basis is their ``Arrete'' (order) dated November 26, 1981(ICAO Annex 16). The U.S. noise certification basis for the Model A320is Part 36 of the FAR with Amendments 36-1 through 36-12 thereto and anysubsequent amendments adopted prior to the date on which the U.S. typecertificate is issued. French noise certification test data will be reviewedby the FAA for compliance with the U.S. noise certification basis.The Model A320 must also comply with the engine emission requirements ofSpecial Federal Aviation Regulation No. 27 (SFAR 27) with Amendments 27-1through 27-5 thereto and any subsequent amendments adopted prior to thedate on which the U.S. type certificate is issued. Engine emission requirementsare also beyond the scope of the bilateral agreement; however, certificationof compliance by the DGAC will be accepted by separate arrangement. Lastly,the statutory provisions of Pub. L. 92-574, ``Noise Control Act of 1972,''require that the FAA issue a finding of regulatory adequacy pursuant toSection 611 of that Act.The French type certification basis, together with the additional requirementsdiscussed above, Part 36 of the FAR, SFAR 27, and the Noise Control Actof 1972, will comprise the U.S. type certification basis for the ModelA320.<ITAG tagnum="84">A320 Design Features</ITAG>GeneralThe Model A320 airplane presented for U.S. type certification is a shortto medium-range, twin-turbofan, transport category airplane with a seatingcapacity of 120 to 179 passengers, a maximum takeoff weight of 162,037pounds, and a maximum operating altitude of 39,000 feet.The structure of the A320 is generally of conventional design and construction,but with considerable use of composite materials. Elements of primary structure(the fin and horizontal tailplane) are constructed of composites as wellas components such as flaps, spoilers, ailerons, engine cowls, and theleading and trailing edge access panels. In addition, the structural designmakes limited use of overspeed protection and active controls in the formof load alleviation.The model A320 utilizes fly-by-wire (FBW) flight controls for the elevators,ailerons, spoilers, tailplane trim, slats and flaps, speed brakes, trimin yaw, and engine control. The aerodynamic surfaces are positioned relativeto the pilot's command by electronic signals sent via airplane wiring fromthe flight control computers to hydraulic actuators. Conventional mechanicalcontrol is provided for the rudder and tailplane trim hydraulic actuators.Should a short-term interrupt occur in the electronic flight controls,flight could be maintained for a period of time through the use of mechanicalcontrol of rudder and tailplane trim.Normal electrical power is supplied by a constant frequency generator oneach engine. An auxiliary power unit (APU) driven electrical generatoris also available. A continuous source of electrical power is requiredby the A320 fly-by-wire flight controls. In the event of the loss of normalelectrical power, a ram air turbine (RAT) is automatically deployed. TheRAT provides hydraulic power which is used by a constant frequency generatorto supply electrical power. Until the RAT powered generator comes on line(approximately 7 seconds), the flight control system is powered from theairplane's batteries. RAT deployment may also be selected manually by pushingswitches either on the electrical or the hydraulic overhead panel. Hydraulicpower to the flight control system is simultaneously provided by threeindependent hydraulic systems. Functions are shared among these systemsin order to ensure airplane control in the event of loss of one or twosystems. Two of the systems are pressurized by variable displacement pumpsdriven by the engine accessory gearbox, and the third system is poweredby an electrically driven pump or by the RAT hydraulic pump in case ofloss of normal electrical power.The airplane has two basic engine configurations: the SNECMA-General ElectricCFM56-5 engines, and the International Aero Engines; (IAE) V2500 engines.Both engine types have a takeoff rating of 25,000 pounds of thrust (sealevel, static). The engine control system consists of a dual channel FullAuthority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) mounted on the fan case of eachengine. Each FADEC interfaces with various airplane computer systems. TheFADEC provides gas generator control, engine limit protection, power management,thrust reverser control, and engine parameter inputs for the flight deckdisplays. In addition to control of the engines from the flight deck throughchanges in power lever position, an autothrust mode is provided which commandsthrust changes directly to the FADEC without a corresponding change inpower lever position. In this mode of operation, the position of the powerlever sets the upper limit for thrust, except when alpha floor is reached.At alpha floor, the engines are commanded to full thrust, regardless oflever position, as part of the high angle-of-attack (AOA) protection. Theautothrust mode can be disengaged by pushing a button on the power leveror by moving the thrust lever to TOGA or IDLE. The engine FADEC and associatedairplane related systems form the complete propulsion control system.Pitch and roll control inputs are made through flight deck side stick controllersmounted on the lateral consoles of the pilot and copilot positions, inplace of central control columns. The flight instruments are displayedon six cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. Two CRT's are mounted directlyin front of both the pilot and copilot and display primary flight instrumentsand navigational information. The other two CRT's are located in the centerof the instrument panel and display engine parameters, warnings, and systemdiagnostics.The proposed type design of the A320 contains novel or unusual design featuresnot envisioned by the applicable Part 25 airworthiness standards and thereforespecial conditions are considered necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC-87-5-NM for the Airbus IndustrieModel A320 series airplanes was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 19, 1987 (52 FR 38772).Some of the comments received were of an editorial or clarifying natureand have been incorporated where appropriate. A discussion of the remainderof the comments follows, corresponding to the specific special conditionas proposed in Notice No. SC-87-5-NM.1. Electronic Flight Controls<T3>Paragraph 1(a).</T3> One commenter expresses concern about the electricalpower availability for the flight test instrumentation while the test isbeing conducted without the availability of normal electrical power sources.The FAA acknowledges these concerns. The test configuration must be tailoredto the airplane and the electrical power demands for the flight instrumentation.One commenter states that the compliance section should provide guidanceon the test duration. The FAA agrees. The duration of the test demonstrationafter the loss of normal engine generated electrical power may be negotiatedwith the FAA on a case-by-case basis for test durations greater than 4hours.Another commenter proposes a clearer definition of normal and standby power.The FAA does not believe that the special condition wording should be changedbut provides the following discussion for clarification for this commenter.Normal engine generated electrical power includes power supplied by theengine driven generators. Standby electrical power includes other meansto generate electrical power on demand using, for example, Auxiliary PowerUnit (APU) generators, Ram Air Turbine (RAT) driven generators, HydraulicMotor Generators (HMG), etc. Batteries are time-limited emergency powersources.One commenter suggests the FAA retain andSection;andSection; 25.1351(d) (1),(2), and (3) in conjunction with this special condition. The FAA disagreesbecause of the reference made to a time period of not less than five minutes.This is no longer relevant with modern aircraft designs.One commenter suggests a clarification of the parenthetical sentence underthe discussion. The FAA agrees and proposes ``A reasonable assumption canbe made that transport airplanes will not have to remain in IMC for morethan 30 minutes after experiencing the loss of normal electrical power.''Another commenter suggests that after 30 minutes in IMC, the airplane shouldbe capable of continuous flight in VMC for a time sufficient to reach analternate airport. The FAA disagrees because it is not feasible to so estimatewhat that time might be, in view of airline service on a world-wide basisand the variety of factors that affect routes and schedules. The FAA maintainsthat electrical power availability must parallel flight endurance.One commenter requests further clarification about flight following lossof normal electrical power. The FAA requires that after 30 minutes of operationin IMC, the airplane should be demonstrated to be capable of continuoussafe flight and landing in VMC. The length of time in VMC conditions mustbe computed based on the maximum flight duration capability for which theairplane is being certified. Consideration for speed reductions from theassociated failure must be made and supported by performance calculationsand a failure analysis.<T3>Paragraph 1(b)(1)(i).</T3> One commenter suggests the removal of thewords ``when the failure or malfunctions occur within the operational flightenvelope.'' The FAA agrees that this requirement could be too severe incases of extreme failure combinations and flight envelope conditions. Thewords ``operational flight envelope'' have therefore been removed fromthe special condition. However, to ensure that the intent of the specialcondition is maintained, the manufacturer must present a document for FAAapproval which contains: failure cases based on a failure analysis of thesystems that affect the flight control systems, details of the analysiswhich was conducted to support the flying qualities, a listing of flightconfigurations with simulated faults, an overall description of the testfacilities, and methodology used to validate the aerodynamic models usedin the simulation.<T3>Paragraph 1(b)(1)(i)(B).</T3> One commenter requests clarificationof the wording of this paragraph. The FAA has revised the special conditionto require that the airplane must be able to withstand the transient loadsinduced by the failure multiplied by a safety factor. It is further notedthat acceptable airplane loads are defined under Special Condition 2(c).The factor of safety varies from 1.0 to 1.5 depending on the probabilityof failure of the system.<T3>Paragraph 1(c).</T3> One commenter requests this paragraph be changedto read: ``In addition to compliance with andSection; 25.671, it must beshown that Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS) signals cannot be alteredunintentionally, or that the altered signal characteristics are such that* * *'' The FAA concurs as this properly reflects the system involved.The special condition is revised accordingly.<T3>Paragraph 1(c)(1).</T3> One commenter proposes that the wording ofthis special condition be changed from ``Stable gain and phase marginsare maintained'' to ``no residual oscillations exist''. The FAA does notconcur. Stable gain and phase margins insure that the selected loop gainshave been investigated for stability of the system throughout the flightenvelope. Residual oscillation may occur as a result of wear, tolerancebuild-up in mechanical systems, etc. or other causes that are not relatedto the system's stability.<T3>Paragraph 1(d).</T3> One commenter suggests that the requirement forpowered control integrity of hydraulic powered systems be deleted becausesuch designs are covered by existing regulations. The FAA disagrees. TheA320 has a reduced number of power control actuators (PCAs) when comparedto previously certified airplanes with hydraulic flight controls (i.e.,3 PCA's on other recently certified large transports vs. 2 on the A320).Equivalent redundancy is achieved on the A320 by using computers and associatedsensors which enhance the ability to detect faults. The electronic controlsystem is now an integral part of the electro-hydraulic actuation systemwhich requires a stronger technical emphasis when finding compliance.Another commenter requests paragraph 1(d) be revised to add the statementthat, in addition to compliance with the requirements of andSection; 25.671of the FAR, the airplane control system must be designed to allow for continuedsafe flight and landing after any failure condition to the flight criticalpowered system which is not shown to be extremely improbable. The FAA concurswith this change, and the special condition is revised accordingly.One commenter expresses concern about the lack of a back-up system forthe Fly-by-Wire (FBW) flight controls, and recommends that an independentmechanical back-up system be required. The FAA does not concur with thiscommenter's premise that there is lack of experience with FBW flight controlsand that with today's technology, FBW flight controls cannot be made tobe as reliable as conventional mechanical systems. Fly-by-wire flight controlsare currently operating successfully in service in military aircraft, onthe space shuttle, and on commercial airplanes and helicopters for secondaryflight controls such as flaps, slats, spoilers, yaw dampers, and brakes.Furthermore, the A320 design has mechanical controls for the rudder andfor back-up stabilizer trim. These controls allow for pitch trim and directionalcontrol to the airplane, independent of the FBW flight controls.One commenter expresses concern for the consequences of an electrical firein the electronic bay, in view of the greatly increased reliance on electricalpower in this airplane. The FAA notes this commenter's concerns; however,the existing regulations, together with these special conditions, are sufficientto address these concerns, including interruption of electrical, hydraulic,and pneumatic power supplies to the essential flight systems. This situationis addressed in the airplane by physical separation of the computers inthe electronic bay and separation of the wire bundles. There is also asmoke detection system and specific procedures to be followed in case ofsmoke from the electronic bay.2. Active Controls<T3>Paragraph 2(a)(1)(ii).</T3> One commenter requests a definition for``the prescribed value of the current requirement.'' The FAA concurs withthis comment and that statement has been replaced with the following: ``foran airplane of similar characteristics without an active control system.''<T3>Paragraph 2(a)(1)(iv).</T3> Two commenters state that if there werenonlinearities in loads beyond limit load, there could be a change in thetraditional ultimate load factor of 1.5. They further state that the proposedspecial condition did not define this factor. The FAA did not propose afactor to replace the current ultimate load factor of 1.5. The factor isdependent upon the nonlinear response of the system and would vary dependingupon the system the FAA is approving. The FAA therefore does not believethat it is appropriate to define the load factor in the special condition. <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(i).</T3> Two comments were received. The first commenterbelieves that if there is a failure in the active control system with nocompensating corrective action, the failure would not have to be detectedprior to the next flight but would be detected within a time interval directlyrelated to the probability of failure and the impact on structural capability.The second commenter believes that the flightcrew must be aware of anyfailure conditions which affect the structural capability of the airplane,whether or not a compensating procedure exists. The FAA does not concurwith either comment. It is not necessary for the flightcrew to be awareof a failure in the active control system during the flight on which thefailure occurs if there is no available corrective action; however, theairplane should not be exposed to the failure condition for an extendedperiod of time. The flightcrew must therefore be alerted to the failurecondition prior to the next flight. The second commenter also states thatthe words ``operational limitations'' in the first sentence should be replacedwith the words ``flight limitations.'' Flight limitations refers to a limitationimposed upon the airplane after an inflight failure and is the correctterm. The FAA concurs, and the special condition is revised accordingly. <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(ii).</T3> One commenter discussed what was necessaryto document compliance with the rule. The FAA agrees with the requirementsthe commenter discussed but it concerns the method of compliance and isoutside the scope of the notice.  <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(ii)(A)(1).</T3> One commenter believes that it isnecessary to conduct a damage tolerance evaluation for compliance withandSection; 25.571(b) to require limit loads be multiplied by a factor of1.5. The commenter misunderstood this paragraph, and the FAA has revisedthis paragraph to state that the damage tolerance evaluation must be accomplishedbased upon the limit loads.  <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(i).</T3> Two commenters state that in thefigure the safety factor should be 1.5 for probability of failure equalto or less than 10^3, to agree with the text. The FAA concurs and the finalspecial condition is revised to correct this error.  <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii).</T3> One commenter objects to thestatement, `` * * * the residual strength level must be at least 1g flightloads combined with \2/3\ of the gust or maneuver conditions specifiedin FAR 25.571(b).'' The commenter states that this requirement is morestringent than the criteria in Advisory Circular (AC) 25.672-1. The FAAconcurs that combining 1g flight loads with \2/3\ of the gust or maneuverconditions of andSection; 25.571(b) can be more severe. The special conditionis therefore revised to reflect the criteria in AC 25.672-1.  <T3>Paragraph 2(a)(2)(ii)(B)(2).</T3> Three comments were received. Thefirst commenter states that the minimum floor of 1.15V<T2>C</T2> for the flutter margin between V<T2>C</T2> and V<T2>D</T2> may penalize the use of a speed limiting system. The FAA agreesthat this may be true in some cases; however, this special condition isnecessary because the speed limiting may result in a margin between V<T2>C</T2> and V<T2>D</T2> that is too small to be used as an analytical fail-safe marginfor flutter clearance. The analytical margin is provided because it isnot possible to substantiate flutter speeds more accurately than 15 percentfor fail-safe conditions. The margin is not directly related to the probabilitythat the airplane may fly 15 percent faster; consequently, it is not properto establish the minimum analytical margin based solely on the dive speeddefinition for this airplane.  The same commenter requests that the last sentence of this special conditionbe clarified or removed since it implies that V<T2>D</T2> can become a variable as a function of the type of failure.The FAA disagrees. This sentence applies to types of failures that maynot only affect flutter but also affect the performance of the speed limitingsystem. In these cases the value of V<T2>D</T2> as used for flutter clearance must be the value of V<T2>D</T2> that would be defined for the airplane with the speed limitingsystem operating at the reduced effectiveness. This should not be confusedwith ``the'' V<T2>D</T2>, it is only the V<T2>D</T2> that would be used as the fail-safe flutter clearance speedfor analytical flutter substantiation.  Another commenter supports the 1.15 minimum floor, but believes that thetransition between M<T2>C</T2>+.05 and 1.15 V<T2>C</T2> is not adequately addressed. Although the FAA did not providea specific transition boundary, the transition is addressed in an equivalentmanner. The special condition contains the statement ``the fail-safe flutterspeed at any altitude need not exceed the value of V<T2>D</T2> that would result from compliance with andSection; 25.335(b) withouta high speed protection system.'' This statement was provided as a convenientmethod of establishing the transition boundary for an airplane that isrelatively conventional without the speed protection system.  <T3>Paragraph 2(b)(1).</T3> One commenter states that realistic gust fieldsfor the purpose of design and certification have not been defined. Thecommenter further states that existing gust criteria used with yaw dampersfor load alleviation have provided adequate levels of safety. The FAA hasnot defined a gust field as part of the special condition; however, itis incumbent upon the applicant to propose and justify a gust field forFAA approval prior to certification.  <T3>Paragraph 2(b)(2).</T3> Two comments were received. One commenter statesthat realistic conditions of severe turbulence are not defined. The FAAdid not define severe turbulence in the notice as the applicant is expectedto propose and justify a level of severe turbulence for FAA approval. Bothcommenters object to the requirement to consider combinations of maneuversand gusts. The FAA disagrees with these commenters. The load alleviationsystem must be evaluated for adequate power supply and control authoritywith combinations of maneuvers and gusts to assure that the system willperform its intended function.  <T3>Paragraph 2(b)(4).</T3> Two commenters believe that paragraph 2(b)(4)should be deleted. The first commenter states that monitoring this flightcritical system is an inappropriate type certification requirement andthat a system failure analysis must be performed to substantiate acceptablefailure probabilities. This commenter also states that periodic data collectionwhich may be required will be instituted through the FAA Maintenance ReviewBoard. The second commenter states that in-service monitoring and implementationof corrective actions is standard procedure and covered by andSection; 25.1529.The FAA does not agree with these commenters. Since the airplane designcriteria for load levels are dependent on the reliability of the activecontrols, the probability of loss of system function must be evaluatedin a realistic or conservative manner before certification. If the systemproves less reliable in service than assessed for certification, adjustmentsin maintenance schedules, load levels, and/or operating limitations maybe required. This necessitates monitoring of the systems for a sufficientperiod of time to substantiate an adequate level of reliability. Neitherthe FAA Maintenance Review Board nor the instructions for continued airworthinesscontained in andSection; 25.1529 contain requirements for reporting failuresof components in an aircraft system. The monitoring equipment is necessaryto assure an adequate safety record for this flight crucial system.  <T3>Paragraphs 2(b)(5) (i) through (iv).</T3> One commenter states thatthese paragraphs contain advisory material which should be removed fromthe special condition and handled as an Issue Paper. The FAA disagrees.These paragraphs are necessary to define an acceptable level of safety,and compliance is required for FAA certification.  A second commenter states that the requirements of paragraphs 2(b)(5) (i)and (iii) go beyond previous experience by requiring a flight test withextensive instrumentation and long flights in search of ``adequate'' turbulence.The FAA disagrees with this comment and expects the flight testing to demonstratethat the active control system does, in fact, provide the anticipated loadrelief. This can be accomplished by verifying loads achieved in flightwith the loads from analysis.   A third commenter states that paragraph 2(b)(5)(iv) should be changed from``An investigation * * *.'' to ``An analytical or test evaluation * * *.''The commenter believes this paragraph requires testing of the active controlsystem after structural damage. The FAA concurs. Testing is not the onlyway to achieve compliance with paragraph 2(b)(5)(iv), but the proposedchange does provide additional clarification; therefore, the final specialcondition is revised accordingly.  <T3>Paragraph 2(b)(5)(iv)5.</T3> One commenter states that the referencefor the definition of failure condition should be changed from AdvisoryCircular (AC) 25.1309-1 to AC 25.672-1. The FAA does not concur. The specialcondition was written based on the accepted definition provided in AC 25.1309-1. 3. Engine Controls and Monitoring  <T3>Paragraph 3(a).</T3> One commenter suggests that the words ``loss ofthrust control'' used in the discussion portion of this special conditionimply that the intent was to limit the reliability evaluation to only thosecontrol failures which would prevent continued safe flight and landingof the airplane. This commenter therefore recommends that the control failuresin question be limited to only those associated with loss of more than50 percent thrust. Another commenter contends that the reliability criteriashould apply only to those failures which would prevent continued safeflight and landing of the airplane. The FAA does not agree. The flightcrew'sinability to control thrust to the desired level would likely result inan in-flight shutdown (IFSD) and, for a twin-engine airplane such as theA320, an emergency being declared and subsequent diversion on a singleengine. The intent of this special condition is to ensure that the probabilityof either single engine events or a multiple engine event is no more likelyon a FADEC-equipped propulsion system than on current hydro-mechanicalcontrolled engines certified to current standards.  One commenter suggests that the special condition for FADEC reliabilityis not necessary since compliance with the ``single failures'' requirementsof andSection; 25.901(c) and the ``isolation'' requirements of andSection;25.903(b) provides the same degree of safety as current propulsion systems.This commenter believes that requiring a level of reliability for one propulsionsubsystem is not necessary or appropriate. The FAA does not agree. It istrue that the ``failsafe'' and ``isolation'' requirements of Part 25 providea degree of safety essential for transport category twin engine aircraft,regardless of the engine control type. This safety experience has beenaccumulated, however, on the vast majority of turbine engines incorporatinghydro-mechanical control systems. The intent of this special conditionis to clearly identify an expected level of reliability for an engine subsystememploying a technology which has not yet accumulated a large amount ofservice experience as an engine control. This special condition is in additionto the requirements of andSection; 25.901(c) for a control system failingsafely, and andSection; 25.903(b) for isolation.  <T3>Paragraph 3(b).</T3> One commenter recommends that the thrust leversshould move corresponding to autothrust commands. This commenter believesthat the proposed wording ``provide adequate cues for the flightcrew tomonitor thrust changes during normal operation * * * '' is too subjective.The FAA agrees that the original proposal could more clearly state theobjective of this requirement and has therefore reworded it to emphasizethe adequacy of the cues needed to monitor the system. The FAA does notagree, however, that the thrust levers would necessarily have to move duringautothrust operation, provided the same (or greater) degree of informationfeedback regarding thrust commands is being provided to the crew. It isthe intent of this special condition to require a satisfactory degree ofmonitoring capability to be incorporated in the design in order to compensatefor the lack of thrust lever motion during autothrust operation.  Two commenters suggest the addition of a new paragraph 3(b)(5) highlightingthe need to consider critical flight phases such as takeoff, approach,and landing. One of these commenters recommends that the ATS system shouldprovide thrust lever motion at flight phases below 1500 feet above groundlevel (AGL) because this is where current autothrottle systems are mosteffective and important in providing tactile feedback to the pilot throughmovement of the thrust levers. The FAA agrees that takeoff, approach, andlanding are especially important flight phases to be considered in assessingthe effectiveness of the ATS command cues, as well as the ease and effectivenessof the disconnect. The FAA does not agree, however, that this may onlybe accomplished by means of physically moving the thrust levers. The specialcondition has been reworded to make it more clear as to the objectivesof monitoring and override capability, and a new paragraph (5) has beenadded to address takeoff, approach, and landing.  <T3>Paragraph 3(c).</T3> One commenter acknowledges that the ``black cockpit''concept is preferred, whereby items are not displayed unless they are required.This same commenter considers, however, that engine instruments are importantenough to be continuously displayed. The FAA agrees that propulsion instruments,because of their role in communicating to the crew needed information relatingto the engine's condition, are of vital importance. This is especiallytrue since, for some engine conditions, rapid crew response is necessaryin order to avoid engine failure. The FAA does not agree, however, thatthis can only be achieved by the permanent display of all engine parameters.The special condition has been reworded to more clearly state the objectivesnecessary for inhibited and shared propulsion displays for the A320.  Another commenter recommends that the loss of all propulsion system displaysbe shown to be extremely improbable. The FAA agrees, and paragraph 3(c)now contains the ``extremely improbable'' objectives for those failureconditions which would provide hazardously misleading information, ratherthan limit the requirement to only ``loss of all propulsion system displays.'' 4. Protection from Lightning and Unwanted Effects of Radio Frequency (RF)Energy  <T3>RF Comments.</T3> One commenter notes that the RF threat only addressesthe critical functions, and that the essential functions were omitted fromconsideration. The FAA believes that not specifying RF protection levelsfor the essential and nonessential functions is reasonable, since a failureof this category will not result in critical maneuvers or cause loss ofcontrol. It is noted that the FAA specifies minimum requirements; the manufactureris well advised to consider additional requirements to protect his designsfrom RF interference for the essential and nonessential functions.  Several commenters express concern regarding the severity of the requirementsthat critical systems must not be affected when exposed to electromagneticradiation. The intent of the special condition is to ensure that systemsperforming critical functions are not adversely affected by RF. The word``adversely'' is not used in this special condition because it is a difficultword to define quantitatively. The determination of whether a criticalsystem is adversely affected must be made on a case-by-case basis. An exampleof an acceptable condition would be a case where a computer input is perturbedby RF spurious signals, but the output signal remains within the designtolerances with the result that the system affected is able to continuein its selected mode of operation unaffected by the perturbation. It isnot permissible that exposure to electromagnetic radiation could resultin a large system upset. Pilot intervention to restore the system followingan upset is not an acceptable means to restore that system to its normalstate of operation.  One commenter expresses concern that no consideration was made to accountfor RF attenuation by the aluminum airframe. The FAA has proposed two methodsto simulate the RF threat. One is based on 200 volts per meter averagefield strength from 10KHz to 20 GHz, applied without fuselage shielding,and the other method is to apply average and peak voltages in nine specifiedfrequency ranges, taking into account the effects of fuselage shielding. One commenter expresses the need for an international agreement for thecontrol and location of large output RF emitters. The FAA has no disagreementwith this comment, but it is beyond the scope of this action.    One commenter believes the threat cannot be precisely defined and proposesthat an interim requirement of 100 volts per meter, applicable to EletronicEngine Control (EEC) and its wiring, exclusive of airframe shielding, beused until more formal standards can be developed. Another commenter proposedto accept the RTCA-DO-160B test procedures and field strength levels tovalidate the Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS). A third commentersuggests that 100 volts per meter be used when applied directly at thesystem level, without the benefit of airframe shielding. Based on the ElectromagneticCompatibility Analysis Center (ECAC) study referenced in the notice andthe high degree of integration of the electronic systems on this aircraft,the FAA has determined that the 200 volts per meter standard is necessary.One commenter notes that the U.S. model representing peak and average valuesof electromagnetic threat is more severe than the equivalent European modeland requests considerations for re-examination of the threat presentedin this special condition. The FAA, in defining the external envelope,considered the information provided by a variety of organizations regardingstrength and characteristics of RF emissions, including the ECAC group.So far the information obtained from these groups has not indicated a needto change the U.S. threat model.Another commenter proposes to differentiate between the source of the threatdefining a likely RF encounter, including airports and enroute flights,as opposed to hypothetical RF encounters which involve powerful emittersoutside the normal airway traffic patterns of civil transport airplanes.The FAA has elected to define the most severe threat as a design requirementwhich includes all potential encounters, in view of the impracticalityof imposing a complex set of operational restrictions. Only those systemthat have been determined to perform flight critical functions need tobe hardened to this level of electromagnetic threat.The same commenter discusses a means of showing compliance when it canbe demonstrated that a safe flight and landing can be achieved, and whenthe threat exceeds the normal RF environment. The effects of the threatwould be evaluated in terms of mode changes and recoverable interrupts,which affect one or several of the subsystems. The FAA disagrees. Suchan approach would make the determination of compliance highly subjectiveand difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, the precise behavior of systemswhich are affected by RF levels equal to those specified in the specialcondition is not predictable in the actual operating environment. The FAAhas adopted a different approach, specifying that critical systems mustnot be affected when exposed to levels of electromagnetic radiation specifiedby this special condition. RF exposure at these levels should not causea system upset involving reconfiguration of the control laws or systemcapability degradation.Another commenter notes that the external threat model has average andpeak levels of 100 volts per meter at two frequency ranges. The alternatemodel requires 200 volts per meter over all frequencies. The commenterrequests that the alternate model be adjusted downward to 100 volts permeter over the entire frequency range. The FAA disagrees and will require200 volts per meter over the frequency range of 10 KHz to 20 GHz. Furthermore,the tests must be conducted with either the external or internal threatmodel over the total frequency range.Another commenter states that the field effects of RF emitters which arelocated within existing prohibited areas should not be considered and thusremoved from the field strength data in the external threat model. TheFAA disagrees because EF emitters can be turned on at any time, emittingvarious field strengths and signal characteristics. It is noted that anumber of emitters are installed onboard naval vessels and are free tomove.<ITAG tagnum="81">Lightning Protection Comments</ITAG>One commenter expresses concern regarding the special condition requirementthat critical systems must not be affected when exposed to lightning. Itis argued that a minor upset that it is not perceptible to the flighcrewand which returns to normal operation after the upset is an ``effect''and thus would not meet the requirement. The intent of the special conditionis to ensure that systems performing critical functions not be adverselyaffected by lightning. The word ``adversely'' is not used in the specialcondition because it is a difficult word to define explicitly. The determinationof whether a critical system is adversely affected must be made on a case-by-casebasis. An example of an acceptable condition would be a case where a computerinput is perturbed by lightning spurious signals, but the output signalremains within the design tolerances and is able to continue in its selectedmode of operation unaffected by the perturbation. It is not permissiblethat a lightning strike could result in a major system upset, even thoughthe effect would not prevent continued safe flight and landing.One commenter proposes new wording to distinguish between lightning effectsthat would prevent the system from functioning and those systems that wouldcontinue with reduced capability. The FAA has considered this approachbut adopted a distinction which recognizes systems that perform criticalfunctions and essential functions.Another commenter believes that the requirements specifying the acceptablelevel of lightning strike effect on the affected systems are vague. TheFAA has revised the wording and specifies that systems which perform criticalfunctions must be designed so that they are not affected. Essential systemsare allowed to recover automatically or by pilot action.5. Flight Characteristics<T3>Paragraph 5(a) </T3>. One commenter questions the need for a handlingqualities rating system special condition and proposes the subject be addressedthrough an issue paper. Another commenter believes the proposed specialcondition lacks detail as to how the handling qualities ratings are tobe used, specifically under what test conditions the airplane handlingqualities must be satisfactory, adequate, or controllable. The FAA disagrees.The special condition should contain only the basic requirements for ahandling qualities rating system. The detailed information, as it appliesto the A320, is contained in an Issue Paper. The A320 will be the firstairplane in which the FAA will use a systematic handling qualities ratingsystem approach for flight control system failure states, and it is believedthat a detailed special condition would not allow latitude in the applicationof the requirements.<T3>Paragraph 5(b).</T3> One commenter recommends that the wording ``suitablehandling qualities'' be changed to ``satisfactory'' handling qualities,degrading to ``adequate,'' and then degrading to ``controllable'' handlingqualities. The FAA disagrees. The effect of the special condition requiring``suitable dynamic and static longitudinal stability'' is essentially thesame as the commenter's proposal. Although the proposed special conditionfor a handling qualities rating (5(a)) is specifically for flight controlsystem failure states, the ratings of satisfactory, adequate, and controllable,and their definitions, are applicable for all handling qualities tasks.<T3>Paragraph 5(c).</T3> One commenter suggests that the rudder pedal forcelimit for sideslip be limited to 150 pounds, rather than 180 pounds. Thiscommenter points out that this change was proposed during the promulgationof Amendment 25-42, effective March 1, 1978. Under Amendment 25-42, therudder pedal force limit was changed from 180 pounds to 150 pounds forair minimum control speed under andSection; 25.149, but was not changed forstatic lateral-directional requirements under andSection; 25.177. The FAAdoes not agree with this commenter. Special conditions are developed fornovel or unique features for which the present regulations do not provideadequate standards. The A320 design is not novel or unique in regard tothe rudder system; therefore, the present regulations are applicable.<T3>Paragraph 5(d).</T3> One commenter suggests that the wording of thisspecial condition be changed to require flight control position annunciation``unless it can be shown that no flight condition exists in which near-fullsurface authority (not crew commanded) is being utilized for prolongedperiods.'' The FAA does not agree. The intent of this special conditionis to require control surface position annunciation for any unforeseenflight condition or configuration, as well as those flight conditions whichcan be analyzed. The FAA questions whether every possible flight conditionor configuration can be analyzed; and, due to the lack of surface deflectionfeedback to the sidestick controller, flightcrews must be immediately awareof control surface saturation that is not crew commanded so that appropriateaction may be taken.Another commenter suggests replacing the words ``near full surface authority''with ``near-maximum achievable deflection.'' This commenter points outthat actuators are rarely sized to provide full deflection at all possibleoperating conditions. While the commenter's suggestion is valid and controlsurfaces are subject to blow down, etc., the design of a control surfaceannunciation which would account for all ``achievable deflections'' wouldbe extremely complex and would not add significantly to the intent of thespecial condition. The special condition has been revised to require annunciationwhen a flight condition exists where, without being commanded by the crew,control surfaces are coming so close to their limits that return to thenormal flight envelope or continuation of safe flight requires a specificcrew action.The same commenter suggests adding a paragraph 5(e) to require that saturationof the flight control surfaces will not occur so frequently as to significantlydegrade the proper functioning of the system. The FAA disagrees. SpecialCondition 1(b), Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS) Failure and ModeAnnunciation, adequately addresses control surface saturation and a specificflight special condition is not required. This commenter also suggestsadding a Paragraph 5(f) to deal with handling qualities transients whenflight control system mode changes occur. The FAA disagrees. Special Conditions1(b) and 6(a) are adequate to deal with handling qualities requirementsfor flight control mode system changes.6. Flight Envelope Protection<T3>Paragraph 6(a)(2).</T3> One commenter recommends requiring provisionsby which the limit protection can be overridden. According to this commenter,studies show that pilots want to be able to override the limit protection.This commenter does not give specifics regarding which parameters are consideredmost important. This comment is addressed to the ``failure state'' portionof this special condition (general limiting requirements) and may be offeredin belief that the FAA requirement (against undue parameter limiting) willnot be successfully implemented or complied with. The selected limit values(NZ, AOA, pitch, roll, high speed) for the NORMAL control state are broadenough to satisfy safe and controllable maneuvering. For failure states,this special condition, as well as the handling qualities rating methodof Special Condition 5(a), are available to determine suitable safe characteristics.It should also be noted that in the A320 design, limit protections aredropped for certain failure states. It may also be helpful to note thatif abnormal attitudes are unexpectedly encountered, Special Condition 6(a)(3)also requires recovery capability.<T3>Paragraph 6(b).</T3> Several commenters request the traditional useof V<T2>MIN</T2> be retained as an alternate means of V<T2>S</T2> definition. The FAA disagrees. These special conditions addressdesign features which are such that traditional V<T2>MIN</T2> testing would not be an acceptable alternate to V<T2>S1-g</T2>.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(1)(i).</T3> One commenter requests that a delta symbolbe inserted before ``F<T2>G</T2>'' in the equation, and that a note be added to indicate thatthe delta F<T2>G</T2> is the increment in gross thrust required to reduce the netthrust to zero. The commenter cites the andSection; 25.103(a)(1) referenceto zero (net) thrust at the stalling speed as the justification for thischange. The following two FAA comments should aid understanding as to whythe equation was provided, and why it still remains valid for this partof the special condition.First, the equation, as presented in the special condition, is a correctexpression of the aerodynamic lift capability of the airplane. In fact,if the 1-g stall speed is to be defined as speed at C<T2>LMAX,</T2> divided by <T4>t</T4>N<T2>ZW</T2>, then alternate C<T2>L</T2> expressions would suffice to determine the speed at which C<T2>LMAX</T2> occurred, as long as ignoring, modifying, or retaining thethrust term only shifted the level of C<T2>LMAX</T2>, and not the speed at which it occurred. The exact expressionof the C<T2>L</T2> equation only becomes a concern for those who wish to reconstructthe requested 1-g stall speed (V/<T4>t</T4>N<T2>ZW</T2>) from exactly such an equation. Once the speed at C<T2>LMAX</T2> has been noted and corrected for the load factor, it canbe retrieved from an intermediate expression, which might assume N<T2>ZW</T2> = 1.0 and only involve GW (or Mach) as the primary independentvariable.Secondly, Special Condition 6(b)(2)(iii) allows IDLE thrust, not exclusivelyzero net thrust, as required by andSection; 25.103(a)(1), to be used in thedetermination of stalling speed.A second commenter notes that ``F<T2>G</T2>'' and ``iF<T2>G</T2>'' are undefined terms in the CL equation of Paragraph 6(b)(1)(i).The FAA assumes that these terms are commonly used symbology. For clarification,``F<T2>G</T2>'' means gross thrust, and ``iF<T2>G</T2>'' means incidence of the gross thrust relative to the airplanefuselage reference line. AOA (angle of attack) is also measured relativeto the fuselage reference line.Several commenters note that the new V<T2>S1-g </T2>usage has not been uniformly applied throughout all Part25 subparts. As configured for operation, the A320 is prevented from stallingby the incorporation of an angle-of-attack limiting feature. This featurewould then not allow demonstration of the stall speeds used for structuraldesign. During development flight testing, Airbus deactivated the stallprotection feature and demonstrated compliance with the existing rulesas currently interpreted both in the clean and flaps down configurations.Therefore, the special condition was not proposed for Subparts Candamp;D.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(2)</T3>_Table B.2. One commenter strongly disagreeswith the 25 degree bank limit before ALPHA floor operation at V<T2>2</T2>, because the operation of ALPHA floor in either all enginesoperating or engine-out cases is beneficial to safety. The commenter suggestsa 20 degree bank limit as being a much more appropriate value, and thatif the FAA requirement prevails, the ALPHA floor feature might be deleted,which would be detrimental to safety. The FAA does not agree that requestinga 25 degree bank capability (free of ALPHA floor) at V<T2>2 </T2>takeoff condition is unreasonable. Neither does the FAA lookat removal of this feature as the only answer to achieving a 25 degreebank capability, since a deficiency (if one were to exist at all) can bemade up by a slight V<T2>2MIN </T2>increase. The 25 degree V<T2>2 </T2>bank requirement is reasonably consistent with the 40 degreebank objectives for landing, and on all-engine takeoff climb capabilityat V<T2>2 </T2>+ 10 to 15. Specifically, the theoretical (zero thrust) ALPHAfloor settings for a landing condition (V<T2>REF </T2>= 1.23 V<T2>S1-g</T2>) and a takeoff condition (V<T2>2MIN </T2>= 1.13 V<T2>S1-g</T2>) for 40 degree and 25 degree bank, respectively, would beabout 1.077 V<T2>S1-g </T2>and 1.076 V<T2>S1-g</T2>. If a 20 degree bank were allowed, the takeoff relationshipwould be mismatched at 1.096 V<T2>S1-g</T2>.Another way of looking at the lower 20 degree recommendation is that instraight flight V<T2>MIN </T2>engine-inoperative climb, only about 4+ kts margin would existfor airspeed variation before automatic thrust increase at ALPHA floorduring a FLEX (reduced thrust) takeoff. This could easily be eroded ingusty conditions. The 25-degree requirement strikes an appopriate balancebetween non-nuisance operation and compatibility with other operating speeds.The French DGAC A320 requirement was also published as 25 degrees at V<T2>2MIN</T2>.One commenter notes Table B.2 has an undefined term, ``WAT.'' The term``WAT'' (Weight-Altitude-Temperature) is thought to be uniformly understoodas the collective independent term for establishing a climb-limited takeoff.The term ``WAT'' will be defined as such in future regulatory and advisorydocuments.One comemnter recommends that the Table B.2 enroute maneuvering bank anglein the enroute configuration at final takeoff speed be reduced from 40degrees to 30 degrees. The reason offered is that the speed in questionrepresents a short duration condition for the airplane, in its accelerationto the enroute speed (engine-inoperative) and that 30 degrees bank, compatiblewith V<T2>2</T2>, has been demonstrated for many years. Since 1981, the FAA hassought to ensure adequate maneuverability at operating speeds by confirmingthe Table B.2 bank angles. For final climb, the target has been 40 degrees,not 30 degrees. When performance speed factors on stall speed were reformulatedbecause of the 1-g basis, instead of minimum speed in the stall, all factorswere reduced by about .94, except for the V<T2>FTO </T2> factor which was reduced slightly less. For compatibilitywith the 40 degree bank objective at V<T2>REF </T2>(1.23 V<T2>S1-g</T2>), the V<T2>FTO </T2>factor was reduced from 1.25 to 1.23. A full .94 reformattingfor V<T2>FTO </T2>would reduce the factor to 1.18. With a V<T2>2MIN </T2>factor of 1.13, second segment and final climb would notshare a compatible 30 degree capability. Optimum V<T2>FTO </T2>or enroute climb speeds are normally well in excess of 1.18V<T2>S1-g</T2>, even for gear down dispatch. By authorizing an excessivelylow V<T2>FTO </T2>(and consequent bank capability), the FAA would be wideningthe speed gap between AFM performance for final and enroute climbs. Also,for gear down dispatch, normally there is no restriction against flightinto icing conditions. Since icing effects are normally not flight testedto confirm predictions for effects on gear down L/D, it does not seem warrantedto reduce the V<T2>FTO </T2>to such a minimum condition of 30 degrees/1.18 V<T2>S1-g</T2>. Finally, because of buffet characteristics, the .94 relationalfactor between V<T2>S1-g </T2> and V<T2>MIN </T2>does not generally prevail for flaps up, as it does for flapsdown. For these reasons, the FAA has determined that the proposed bank/speedfactor values for the A320, flaps up, are still appropriate.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(2)(viii). </T3>One commenter requests the V<T2>FTO </T2>factor on V<T2>S1-g </T2>be reduced from 1.23 to 1.18. The FAA has responded to thiscomment in conjunction with the bank objective of Table B.2.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(2)(xi). </T3>Two commenters request deletion of thisrequirement, suggesting that andSection; 25.143 of the FAR and AC 25-7, FlightTest Guide, already cover the operational assessment adequately. The FAAdisagrees that andSection; 25.143 and AC 25-7 provide adequate regulatorycoverage, in view of the fact that this airplane incorporates significantEFCS mode changes and a limiter between approach AOA and AOA for C<T2>LMAX</T2>. While definitive quantitative requirements, such as forpath angle/delta speed, have not been promulgated, a reasonable assessmentcan be made in this critical area. The Joint European Authorities havepublished a somewhat similar special condition which deals with the effectsof atmospheric disturbance on low speed flying qualities.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(2)(xii). </T3>One commenter recommends changing 40%to 30% in the reformulation of andSection; 25.145(b)(1). This is a validcomment and the change has been accomplished for compatibility with otherspecial condition changes.Two commenters recommend changing V<T2>MIN </T2>to V<T2>SW </T2>in andSection;andSection; 25.145(b)(6), 25.175(c), and 25.175(d).One commenter believes a typographical error was made in the notice, andthe other commenter believes V<T2>SW </T2>is needed for consistency with the 1-g stall speed reformulations.The FAA disagrees with both commenters. The published requirements, usingV<T2>MIN </T2>as the end point, are correct. The A320, in the normal EFCSstate, has no artificial stall warning and probably will not have naturalstall warning at the equivalent speed. The term V<T2>MIN </T2>relates to steady state minimum speed on the AOA limiter,is a higher speed than the V<T2>MIN </T2>which would be measured in a full stall, and reasonably correlateswith previous requirements.<T3>Paragraph 6(b)(2)(xiv). </T3>Two commenters provide similar objectionsto the power-off, straight ahead 5KTS/5% stall-free margin requirement.These commenters state that 2KTS/2% is historically equivalent to the FAR,when reformatted to the 1-g basis. For turning flight stalls, the commentersobject to the term ``stall-free characteristics'' as being undefined, andwould essentially substitute a qualitative or non-hazardous finding forsafe flight, once recovery is initiated one second after warning onset.The FAA disagrees. The stall warning requirements are intended for failurestates, of which there could be many, including non-standard aerodynamicand EFCS configurations. Forward c.g. stalling speeds are not usually developedfor these variations, which could present difficulties in basing warningmargins solely on the ``normal'' 1-g stall speed. If warning margins werebased upon 1-g stall speeds, the commenter's suggested 2KTS/2% marginswould be inadequate for a normal state airplane, as well as for a failurestate airplane. This is because realistic margin to useable lift, not justequivalent margin to stall end point, as derived from current minimum speedrules, must be considered. As to the argument that ``stall-free characteristics''is an undefined term, if stall characteristics have been defined and evaluatedfor years, then absence of those same characteristics should not suddenlypresent a definition problem.7. Side Stick Controllers<T3>Paragraph 7(b). </T3>One commenter suggests that this special conditionrequires that the side sticks be connected because of delays which unconnectedside stick controllers can cause. Another commenter recommends the wordingbe changed to require that the pilots are aware of their own inputs, aswell as the other pilot's inputs, at all times. This commenter believesconfusion exists if one pilot is not aware of the other pilot's inputs.A third commenter suggests the wording be changed to require overridingcontrol inputs by either pilot with no unsafe characteristics during timecritical control phases; e.g., landing flare and evasive maneuvers. Allof the commenters are concerned about the lack of side stick controllerinterconnection, especially during critical phases of flight. The FAA isaware of concerns about the lack of feedback or coupling in the A320 sidestick controller design. Studies and research conducted by several organizationshave shown that although some form of controller coupling is highly desirable,the lack of coupling is not, in itself, an unsafe design. The special conditiondoes not contain a firm requirement for side stick controller coupling,but it does require that the side stick controller design of the A320 beadequately evaluated.8. Flight Data RecorderOne commenter states that since the rudders on the A320 are conventionalin design, it should therefore suffice to record either the pedal positionor the surface position. The FAA notes that inputs from the pilot, as wellas command signals from the different computers to the rudder trim, ruddertravel limitation, yaw damper and autopilot servo loops are also inputedto the rudder servos. For this reason, the FAA requires that the pilotinputs and the surface position be recorded.Another commenter questions the need for additional parameters to recordelectrical inputs to control surfaces and engine commands in addition tothe surface movements. The A320 is a flight-through-computer airplane.For that reason, there is no longer a linear relationship between pilotinput and output of the computer to the surface servo actuators. It istherefore necessary to record the output of the sidestick, rudder pedals,throttles, and flap handles, as well as the surface positions, in orderto reconstruct the pilot inputs and surface response.One commenter requested, prior to the expiration of the comment period,an extension in order to provide an indepth analysis of what was considerednecessary for an adequate analysis of system failures in case of an accident.This commenter states that their organization participated as observersin the investigation of the fatal accident of an A320 airplane in France.As a result of the insight into the uniqueness of the control systems ofthis airplane gained through analysis and augmented by the above accidentparticipation, they request a number of additional parameters and changesin sampling rates. This commenter also states that Version 2 of the DFDR(design) characterisctics comes closest to their requirements. The FAArecognizes that major change requests submitted late in a type certificationprocess can cause undue hardship on a manufacturer and is therefore veryreluctant to agree to additions or changes. However, it is also consideredthat this situation is unique in that an accident was investigated priorto issuance of the U.S. type certificate, and a need for changes appearsto be justified. Furthermore, Version 2 of the DFDR parameter is requiredby another airworthiness authority and thus already an available design.This commenter requests that Version 2 be modified to change certain samplingrates and to add others. Incorporation of those comments would utilizeall of the remaining storage capacity of the DFDR system in an appropriatesampling mix of parameters which, in the view of the FAA, would enchancedata retrieval for the purposes of aviation safety. Accordingly, this specialcondition has been revised, with the manufacturer's concurrence, to includeall of the above requested parameters, except for auto-brake setting andbrake pressure (left and right alternating).Under standard practice, the effective date of these final special conditionswould be 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. As the intended U.S. type certification datefor the Airbus A320 is approximately December 15, 1988, the FAA finds thatgood cause exists to make these special conditions effective upon issuance.Except as discussed above, the special conditions for the A320 are adoptedas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on onemodel series of airplanes.

This level of reliabilityfor the loss of thrust control on one engine will result in an overallairplane propulsion control system reliability that is consistent withthe guidance associated with andSection; 25.1309(b)(1), assuming an independenceof the failure conditions that contribute to the loss of thrust control.Proper compliance with andSection;andSection; 25.901(c) and 25.903(b) shouldnot result in any control system functions for one engine that are criticalto continued safe flight and landing, that are totally dependent on FADECsystem reliability to meet the objectives of andSection; 25.1309(b)(1).

These waveforms depictthreats that are external to the airplane. How these threats affect theairplane and its systems depend upon airplane geometry, the system's installationconfiguration, materials, shielding, etc. Therefore, tests (including testson the completed airplane or an adequate simulation) and/or verified analysisneed to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat tothe installed systems.

Whilea single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance,multiple signal upsets over an extended period of time (2 seconds) mayaffect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing and/oranalysis need to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environmentto demonstrate that the system response meets the safety objective. Thisexternal multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is describedas a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of \1/2\magnitude of component D (Peak Amplitude of 50,000 amps), all within 2seconds.

If the limited is set at a value beyond the structuraldesign limit maneuvering load factor ``n'' of andSection;andSection;25.333(b)and 25.337 (b) and (c), there should be a very positive tactile feel builtinto the controller and obvious to the pilot that serves as a deterrentto inadvertently exceeding the structural limit.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>High-Speed Limiting. </T3>In addition to compliance with the requirementsof andSection;25.143 of the FAR, the following applies: ``Operation of thehigh-speed limiter during all routine and descent procedure flight mustnot impede normal attainment of speeds up to overspeed warning.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) <T3>Pitch and Roll Limiting. </T3>In addition to compliance with the requirementsof andSection;25.143 of the FAR, the following applies: ``Operation of thepitch and roll limiter must not:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Impede normal maneuvering for pitch angles up to the maximum requiredfor normal maneuvering, including a normal all-engine takeoff, plus a suitablemargin to allow for satisfactory speed control.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Restrict or prevent attainment of roll angles up to 65 degreesor pitch attitudes necessary for emergency maneuvering.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">7. Side Stick Controllers.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Pilot Strength. </T3>In lieu of the ``strength of pilots'' limits ofandSection;25.143(c) for pitch and roll, and in lieu of specific pitch forcerequirements of andSection;andSection;25.145(b) and 25.175(d), the followingapplies: ``It must be shown that the temporary and maximum prolonged forcelevels for the side stick controllers are suitable for all expected operatingconditions and configurations, whether normal or non-normal.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Controller Coupling. </T3>In the absence of specific requirements forcontroller coupling, the following applies: ``The electronic side stickcontroller coupling design must provide for corrective and/or overridingcontrol inputs by either pilot with no unsafe characteristics. Annunciationof controller status must not be confusing to the flightcrew.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) <T3>Pilot Control. </T3>In the absence of specific requirements for sidestick controllers, the following applies: ``It must be shown by flighttests that the use of sidestick controllers does not produce unsuitablepilot-in-the-loop control characteristics when considering precision pathcontrol/tasks and turbulence.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>Autopilot Quick-Release Control Location. </T3>In lieu of compliancewith andSection;25.1329(d) of the FAR, quick release (emergency) controlsmust be on both side stick controllers. The quick release means must belocated so that it can readily and easily be used by the flightcrew.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">8. Flight Recorder.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) In addition to compliance with the requirements of andSection;25.1459(a)of the FAR, the flight recorder must record the following parameters inaddition to those required by Appendix B of Part 121:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Pilot and copilot sidestick pitch controller, pitch control surfaceposition, pilot and copilot sidestick roll controller, aileron surfaceposition, spoiler surface position, rudder pedal position, rudder surfaceposition, auto thrust system commanded thrust parameter, total air temperature(TAT), and frame counter.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The following for each engine installation: Actual thrust (N1/N2),electronic engine control, commanded thrust, and thrust lever position. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) In lieu of compliance with andSection;25.1459(a)(4) of the FAR,there must be an aural or visual means for preflight checking that dataare being recorded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Seattle, Washington, on December 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Leroy A.
