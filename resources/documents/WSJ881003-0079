The San Jose, Calif., computer maker didn't say how much of an earnings drop-off it is expecting. It did say second-quarter sales totaled between $125 million and $135 million, which would represent a 22% to 32% increase from the year-ago period's $102.6 million. Final results will be released at the end of this month.    Wyse fell $1 to $10.625 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.    Wyse said sales of its personal computers dropped significantly after it raised its prices about 5% three months ago in response to rising prices for memory chips it uses. The company said sales have rebounded after it recently cut prices. Wyse also cited the seasonal European holiday drop-off in its international sales. </TEXT></DOC>
