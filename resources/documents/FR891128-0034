The assessment providesa basis for the conclusion that the field testing of these geneticallyengineered cotton plants will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Monsanto Agricultural Company, of St. Louis, Missouri, has submitted anapplication for a permit for release into the environment, to field testcotton plants genetically engineered to tolerate the herbicide glyphosateor to resist select lepidopteran insects. The field trial will take placein Kauai, Hawaii.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the cotton plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concludedthat the field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introductionor dissemination and will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding a modified 5-</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase which shows reduced sensitivityto the herbicide glyphosate or a gene encoding delta-endotoxin has beeninserted into the cotton chromosome. In nature, chromosomal genetic materialcan only be transferred to other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plantsby cross-pollination because the field test plot is a sufficient distancefrom any sexually compatible plants with which it might cross-pollinate.2. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">phosphoshikimate synthase gene nor the delta-endotoxin gene themselves,nor their gene products, confer on cotton any plant pest characteristics.Traits that lead to weediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannotbe conferred by adding a single gene.3. The plant from which the 5-</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene and the micro-organismfrom which the delta-endotoxin gene was isolated are not plant pests.4. Select noncoding regulatory regions derived from plant pests have beenincorporated into the plant DNA but do not confer on cotton any plant pestcharacteristics.5. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">phosphoshikimate synthase nor the delta-endotoxin gene provides thetransformed cotton plants with any measurable selective advantage overnontransformed cotton in the ability to be disseminated or to become establishedin the environment.6. The vector used to transfer the genes to cotton plants has been evaluatedfor its use in this specific experiment and does not pose a plant pestrisk in this experiment. The vector, although derived from a DNA sequencewith known plant pest potential, has been disarmed; that is, genes thatare necessary for producing plant disease have been removed from the vector.The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenic to plants.7. The vector agent, the bacterim that was used to deliver the vector DNAand the genes into the plant cell, has been shown to be eliminated andno longer associated with the transformed cotton plants.8. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.9. Glyphosate is one of the herbicides that is rapidly degraded in theenvironment. It has shown to be less toxic to animals than many herbicidescommonly used.10. Delta-endotoxin is a polypeptide which upon ingestion kills only selectlepidopteran insects. Delta-endotoxin is not toxic to other insects, wildor domestic birds, fish or mammals. Because of its safety, its topicalapplication on vegetable crops is permitted up to harvest date.11. The field test site is small (about 3 acres) and physically isolatedby a surrounding area of cultivated land.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC this 21st day of November 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William F.
