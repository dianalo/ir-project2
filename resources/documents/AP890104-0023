Can a president, or a former one, be forced to testify in a legalcase? Courts have provided little guidance, but constitutionalexperts said Tuesday that North's legal tactic may succeed.   No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminaltrial, but several have provided testimony or what might beconsidered the equivalent.   The personal stakes are high for North. The former White Houseaide is charged with theft, conspiracy to defraud the government andseveral other felonies in the case involving the support ofNicaraguan rebels with money from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.   His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 31 _ just 11 days after Bushis to succeed Reagan. Besides Reagan and Bush, subpoenas also havebeen issued for other key figures in the Reagan administration,including Secretary of State George P. Shultz and four other StateDepartment officials.   The man who first tried to force a president to testify was AaronBurr, a former vice president who stood trial in 1807 on charges oftreason.   Burr sought to force Thomas Jefferson, the president under whomhe had served, to testify at the trial.   Jefferson resisted. But Chief Justice John Marshall, presidingover the trial, ruled against Jefferson. The president eventuallyavoided having to appear by releasing some information Burr hadsought.   The closest the Supreme Court has come to ruling on the issuepresented by North's subpoena came in the Watergate tapes decisionof 1974, in a case called Nixon vs. U.S.   The court then ruled, 8-0, that President Richard M. Nixon had tocomply with a special prosecutor's subpoena seeking the surrender ofWhite House tape recordings.   ``The general assertion of privilege must yield to thedemonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminaltrial,'' the high court ruled 15 years ago.   Jerome Barron, a law professor at George Washington Universityhere, said Tuesday the 1974 decision is a strong precedent for North.   ``Whether Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush can be subpoenaed was resolvedin Nixon vs. U.S., and the answer is yes,'' Barron said.   ``If the evidence (sought by North) is material, I think Reaganand Bush can be required to appear,'' Barron said.   On the other hand, unnamed Justice Department sources were quotedby The Washington Post as saying that Nixon vs. U.S. offers supportfor fighting subpoenas of Reagan and Bush. They said the SupremeCourt emphasized that its Watergate-tapes decision did not deal witha claim of privilege based on national security grounds.   Justice Department and White House officials have said they willtry to have the subpoenas thrown out.   Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who once served as generalcounsel to the House of Representatives, said North may succeed.   ``My sense is North has a good claim. The president was involvedin the process, and one of North's defenses is that he was servingthe president by following orders,'' Brand said.   In 1975, then-President Gerald R. Ford gave a videotapeddeposition in the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who wasconvicted of trying to assassinate Ford. The videotape was playedfor jurors at Fromme's trial.   While in office, President Jimmy Carter provided videotapedtestimony in two criminal prosecutions.</TEXT></DOC>
