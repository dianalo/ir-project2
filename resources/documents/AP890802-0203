Paul Adams, inspector general at the Department of Housing andUrban Development, said known consultant fees now total more than$5.7 million for a single housing rehabilitation program. He saidabout one-fifth of all low-income apartment rehabilitations weresnared by companies employing 20 consultants.   The consultants include politically influential Republicans andformer agency officials.   A Senate panel heard the testimony as a House subcommittee voted6-0 to subpoena Lance Wilson to testify in September. Wilson, aformer executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce,failed to appear voluntarily last week to discuss allegations ofabuse and mismanagement at the agency, saying his attorney was ill.   Meanwhile, the HUD scandal spilled over onto the Senate floor.   Majority Leader George Mitchell said the agency had been ``usedas a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors... to politically well-connected individuals'' during the Reaganadministration.   Republican Leader Bob Dole countered that the Democraticmajority was stalling efforts by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to cleanup the department by delaying confirmation votes on several keyappointees.   ``Let's make certain we understand that Congress hasn't beenvery cooperative,'' Dole said. ``Now we've got a situation whereSecretary (Jack) Kemp is trying to do the right thing, and hedoesn't have anybody on board.''   The Senate Banking Committee voted 17-0 Wednesday to recommendapproval of the nomination of C. Austin Fitts as AssistantSecretary of Housing and it was approved by unanimous consent bythe full Senate late Wednesday.   Adams' report to the Banking Committee included several familiarnames of consultants who received large fees.   They included Joseph Strauss, a former HUD official who receivednearly $1.7 million in fees; former Interior Secretary James Watt,who received $300,000; former HUD Secretary and current U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, who received $138,445, and PhilipAbrams, a former agency undersecretary who got $100,000.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said, ``In some of the earlier hearingswe identified the rats, now we're starting to identify the cheesethat attracted these rats.''   Much of the profit that developers made from HUD programs werederived from tax credits and rent subsidies for apartments in areaswhere housing demand was weakening.   The profits were used to pay millions of dollars in consultantfees on projects in a handful of states that shouldn't have gottensuch projects because they had ``weak or very weak'' rentalmarkets, according to Adams and other analysts.   ``Multiple benefits were awarded to eligible projects bydifferent administering agencies such as HUD, state tax creditallocation agencies and local governments,'' said John M. Ols Jr.director of housing and community development issues of the GeneralAccounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.   The GAO found developers received between $250,000 and $2.1million above their purchase and renovation costs in its review ofeight projects in HUD's troubled moderate rehabilitation programs,he said.   ``This is the profit of the developer less any income taxes hewould have to pay,'' said Ols.   Ols said excessive government rent subsidies for those projectscould amount to $25 million over the 15-year period of the HUDrental subsidy contracts.   In an update of his April audit of the moderate rehabilitationprogram, HUD Inspector General Adams told the panel 20 consultantswere paid more than $5.7 million for lobbying for 51 projects.   Those projects covered 7,268 rental units, or 20.3 percent ofthe moderate rehabilitation funding available since 1983, Adamssaid.   In addition, Adams found many of the projects concentrated infour states _ Colorado, Oklahoma, Nevada and Wyoming _ whichreceived more funds than they would have if they had beendistributed using the ``fair share'' formula that Congress hadwaived.   ``The bottom line is that the mod rehab program probably was notneeded in these states during that time period,'' said Adams.   The rental markets at the time these projects were approved wereeither ``weak or very weak'' said Morton J. Schussheim, a housingspecialist with the Congressional Research Service.   Schussheim examined 20 projects funded by the mod rehab programwhose mortgages were originated by the Knoxville, Tenn.-basedBenton Mortgage Co. under the federal coinsured mortgage program.   Schussheim told the committee he could not determine ifdevelopers sought situations where properties could be bought atcomparatively low prices because the market was ``soft'' but saidit was a ``plausible hypothesis.''   Ols said the soft markets provided developers opportunity toconvert available future tax credits on the projects to ready cashby selling to investors through syndicators.</TEXT></DOC>
