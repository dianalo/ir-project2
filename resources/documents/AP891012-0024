HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Large bulges in the main blood vessel in theabdomen should be repaired because they are likely to burst, butmost small ones do not require routine surgery, a study publishedtoday concludes.   These balloon-like bulges, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms,are being increasingly spotted as people undergo ultrasound teststo check for other problems, such as gallstones and cancer.   About 40,000 Americans have surgery to repair these aneurysmseach year, but some doubt lingers about whether smaller aneuryismscan be safely ignored. When the aneurysms break, massive bleedingmay result, and about half of all such victims die.   The latest study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that mostabdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones poselittle risk of rupture.   ``Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to beroutinely repaired,'' said Dr. John W. Hallett Jr., senior authorof the study. ``Their repair should be individualized.''   He said that in some cases, repair of small aneurysms may beconsidered reasonable, such as when patients suffer painfulsymptoms or have other blood vessel disease. Overall, he estimatedthat surgery is appropriate for about one-third of patients withsmall abdominal aneurysms under 5 centimeters in size.   For the rest, he recommended that doctors follow patients withexams every three to six months.   The latest study, based on a survey 370 aneurysm patients inRochester, Minn., was published in the New England Journal ofMedicine.   Hallett said some surgeons recommend fixing all aneurysmsbecause of the belief that they will eventually expand and rupture.However, several vascular surgeons said they are very selective andlimit routine surgery to patients with aneurysms larger than 4 or 5centimeters.   ``I don't think anybody has evidence that aneurysm surgery isoverused,'' said Dr. William Abbott of Massachusetts GeneralHospital. ``I do exactly as they say. I am quite aggressive withaneurysms over 5 centimeters and very selective on something that'ssmaller. I don't think this will blow the medical profession away.''   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. E. StanleyCrawford of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recommendedsurgery for aneurysms larger than 4 centimeters. He questioned theselection and diagnosis of patients in the study and said he doesnot believe it accurately reflects the natural course of aneurysms.   In the study, doctors concluded that the risk of rupture aftereight years was 25 percent in people with aneurysms larger than 5centimeters, 5 percent in those with aneurysms between 3.5 and 5centimeters and zero in people with aneurysms smaller than 3.5centimeters.</TEXT></DOC>
