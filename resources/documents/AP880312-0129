McFarlane to pleadguilty to four misdemeanor counts, Independent Counsel Lawrence E.Walsh virtually secured a major prosecution witness if otherplayers in the Iran-Contra affair go to trial.   McFarlane's promise of full cooperation as part of the pleaagreement is a prize for Walsh. The former national securityadviser was among the inner circle of Reagan administration aideswho masterminded the Iran-Contra scheme.   Walsh said McFarlane's cooperation would solve the technicalproblem of ``joinder.'' Legal experts said this means Walsh couldhave live testimony from a crucial player instead of having tobuild his case around documents.   McFarlane, who was national security adviser from October 1983through November 1985, initiated the review of U.S. arms policytoward Iran. After leaving the White House he remained a keypolicymaker, leading an unsuccessful arms-for-hostages mission toTehran in May 1986.   His guilty plea focused on his role in secret U.S. assistance tothe Nicaraguan Contras at a time Congress had banned such aid.   He admitted that he withheld information about the activities ofLt. Col. Oliver L. North and other members of the National SecurityCouncil staff in three 1985 letters to House committees.   He also admitted withholding information from the House ForeignAffairs Committee when he told the panel on Dec. 8, 1986, that hewas unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the Contrasfrom a third country.   Although Walsh and McFarlane agreed that the cooperation wasvoluntary, the independent counsel acknowledged McFarlane couldhave faced much more serious perjury charges if he wasuncooperative.   Each of the misdemeanor counts of withholding informationcarries a maximum one year prison term. By contrast, felony perjurycharges carry a maximum of five years in prison, and larger finesalso could be levied.   Walsh said McFarlane's cooperation wasn't the only reason hewent the misdemeanor route.   He cited McFarlane's ``undisguised demonstration of remorseafter the false testimony was given in which he tried to correcthis testimony; and actually imposed injury upon himself in a fit ofdepression,'' a reference to McFarlane's attempted suicide via anoverdose of Valium last year.   While admitting his guilt, McFarlane told reporters he acted ata time that relations between Congress and the White House ``brokedown so tragically.''   ``My actions were motivated by what I believed to be in theforeign policy interest of the United States,'' he said.   McFarlane's comments were reminiscent of remarks by former CIADirector Richard Helms on Oct. 31, 1977, when he pleaded no contestto two misdemeanor charges under the same law used by Walsh.   The charges against Helms arose from his testimony to the SenateForeign Relations Committee that the CIA had made no attempt toprevent the election of Marxist Salvador Allende as president ofChile in 1970.   ``I found myself in a position of conflict,'' said Helms. ``Ihad sworn by my oath to preserve certain secrets ... I didn't wantto lie. I didn't want to mislead the Senate. I was simply trying tofind my way through a very difficult situation in which I foundmyself.''</TEXT></DOC>
