Ms. Bhutto's four-day trip to China _ her first abroad sincebecoming prime minister _ is a sign both of Beijing's importance toIslamabad and to the new prime minister herself.   For China, the visit comes at a time of great change in itsrelations with the rest of Asia. Improving ties with India and theSoviet Union no longer make Pakistan a natural ally. But otherfactors, such as a shrinking arms market highlighting Pakistan'simportance as a buyer, guarantee a good relationship for some timeto come.   ``In other countries you are witnessing the first visits to Chinain 30 years,'' said Pakistan's ambassador, M. Akram Zaki, referringto the recent visit to China by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhiand the planned summit in May with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev. ``With us, we have been friends throughout.''   Indeed, despite momentous political changes _ coups and wars inPakistan, the Cultural Revolution in China _ the relationshipbetween the two countries has improved steadily since 1950, whenIslamabad first recognized Beijing.   Ms. Bhutto has been in office just over two months, becomingprime minister in December after Pakistani leader Mohammed Ziaul-Haq died in a plane crash.   She will meet with all of China's top leaders and is expected tosign two agreements of limited importance: a barter trade agreementand an agreement on the mutual protection of investment.   The nations exchanged their first prime ministerial visit in1956, but the relationship began to pick up quickly after China'sborder war with India in 1962.   Military cooperation, which remains the most critical element inthe relationship, began in 1965, during Pakistan's battles withIndia.   China began selling Pakistan arms. Today 50 percent of Pakistan's400-plane air force comes from China, as do 1,100 of its 1,600tanks, according to the Stockholm International Peace ResearchInstitute. Only the United States sells more weapons to Pakistan.   China also helps Pakistan with its nuclear industry, havingsigned an agreement in September 1986.   Although the agreement said cooperation would be limited topeaceful uses, there have been persistent reports China is helpingPakistan build an atomic bomb.   Both China and Pakistan have denied this, but Western diplomatssay they are convinced cooperation in this field is not limited toelectricity.   Trade has been a disappointing part of the relationship. In 1987,total trade hit $360 million, with a large surplus in China's favor.   Relations with China went from good to very good during theadministration of Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whovisited China three times when he was president and prime ministerfrom 1971 to 1976.   The relationship improved under Zia, who ousted the elder Bhuttoin a coup. Significantly, though, Beijing is said to have been quickto support Ms. Bhutto once it appeared she enough votes to form agovernment.   China's ambassador to Pakistan met her three times within threedays of the election.</TEXT></DOC>
