 Each working hourthat the network is down can mean hundreds or even thousands of dollars inlost productivity and lost revenues.andM;Companies that depend on networks as a core technology for their businessneed to have a strategy for managing, maintaining and repairing the network.andO;In many cases, that means having a staff of trained managers and techniciansto oversee network operations--24 hours a day, seven days a week.andM;Fortunately for most sites, relying on an outside vendor for &quot;24-by-7&quot;service has become much more affordable.andP;  In fact, it costs the same tocontract for 24-by-7 service from an outside vendor as it does to contractfor eight-hour-a-day, five-day-a-week service because of the hidden costsassociated with the latter option.andP;  (See &quot;Network Maintenance Costs ByService and Source,&quot; below.)andM;For example, consider a large financial services organization with offices inDallas, Denver and Boston.andP;  The company has 1,000 terminals connected toVAXclusters, plus dozens of workstations, PCs and Macintoshes.andP;  The personalcomputers in each site are connected in local area networks, which in turnare connected to the VAXclusters, and the three sites are connected to oneanother by fractional T1 lines.andM;For a configuration like this, DEC would charge about $16,000 per month, or$192,000 per year, for 24-by-7 network maintenance.andP;  Included in that overallmaintenance service is remote monitoring from DEC's Customer Support Center,which is tied into a Digital Service Processor at headquarters, as well asfault management, on-site support and monthly evaluations to analyze errorlogs and take action before problems reach a critical level.andM;This service would include multivendor support, including networking systemsand hardware that DEC itself does not sell.andM;By contrast, an 8-by-5 plan might initially appear to be more attractive, butit turns out that the cost of two network system managers added to the feefor the 8-by-5 service just about equals the cost of a 24-by-7 service plan.andO;And remember, the 24-by-7 service plan eliminates the headaches associatedwith late-night phone calls from irate users.andM;A contracted 8-by-5 network maintenance support solution provided by DECwould cost about $8,000 per month, or $96,000 per year, DEC officials said.andO;That solution would also require network management tools and in-housepersonnel at a cost of about $91,000 per year, given that two networkmanagers' salaries and benefits would come to about $90,000.andP;  This brings thetotal cost of an 8-by-5 plan to just over $187,000, including the networkmanagement tools.andM;Add to that the time and money for training and other ancillary expenses, andthe total cost of an 8-by-5 plan just about equals the $192,000 cost of24-by-7 service.andP;  In addition, under a 24-by-7 plan your organization wouldnever have concerns about vacations, insurance, profit-sharing, facilities,training or sick time.andM;In reality, purchase and installation account for only a fraction of thetotal cost of the network.andP;  According to a report from the Index Group, amanagement consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., respondents in automotive,manufacturing, insurance, engineering and other industries indicated thatabout two-thirds of the overall costs of network ownership are associatedwith maintenance, including operation, changes in personnel, the number ofusers, software costs, monthly charges and space.andP;  (See &quot;Distribution ofNetwork Expenses over 5 Years,&quot; page 38.)andM;According to the Index Group, a full 25 percent of the cost of acquiring andmaintaining a network over a five-year period can be attributed to personnelcosts.andP;  (See &quot;Cost Per Port over 5 Years,&quot; page 38.)andM;With this in mind, the only point at which an 8-by-5 service plan begins tomake financial sense is if your company has a small enough network to requirejust one dedicated network manager, or if the network manager and the systemmanager are the same person.andP;  Then the cost of that person's salary andbenefits can be justified across two functions.andM;When the costs of in-house 24-by-7 coverage are compared with the pricescharged by an outside supplier, the savings are even more dramatic.andP;  Anin-house staff would require about five people, totaling $227,500 annuallyassuming that the staff members' salaries, including benefits, average about$45,000.andP;  Network management tools would cost about $82,000.andP;  The tools wouldinclude the hardware and software for a $36,000 wide area network managementstation at company headquarters, at least two $20,000 site managementstations to monitor the various LANs, and about $3,000 worth of software tomonitor the file servers on each LAN.andP;  That brings the total cost of inhousesupport to $309,500, compared with the $192,000 charged by DEC.andM;The simplest and best way to justify a network management strategy is to lookat how much your company has invested in its network and estimate how muchnetwork downtime would cost your company.andM;It appears that network management and the cost of factoring out networkdowntime are overlooked at most sites.andP;  A DR Strategies survey found that 37percent of the respondents had never calculated the cost of network downtimeat their sites.andP;  Ninety-seven percent of the Fortune 1000-level companiespolled in a smiliar survey by Infonetics, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based marketresearch company, had not performed such calculations.andM;On average, the DR Strategies poll of 100 VAX sites that have implemented orare considering network maintenace support strategies found that therespondents' networks were down an average of 17 hours per year.andP;  Estimatesby survey respondents of the hourly cost averaged $5,671, making the annualmean cost of network downtime $96,407.andM;But the cost of downtime can skyrocket for large, companywide networks.andO;downtime on these networks not only means lost system dollars, it also meanslost revenues for the company as a whole.andM;The Infonetics survey found that the average campuswide local area networkwas completely or partially disabled 6 percent of the time, with an averageof 23.6 network disabilities per year, lasting an average of 4.9 hours.andO;Using wide cost parameters, infonetics estimates that the average losses are$30,093 per hour in productivity, $5,240 per hour in revenues and $520 perhour in direct expenses, or about $36,000 per hour--more than $4 million peryear.andM;Companies that depend on their networks for their primary business activityare particularly hard hit when the network fails.andP;  For instance, atelephone-order retail catalog company that uses minicomputers to process 10orders per minute at an average of $50 each would lose almost $500 perminute, or $30,000 per hour in sales.andM;Although a good network maintenance support strategy can pay for itself asinsurance against downtime and lost productivity, designing that strategyrequires analysis based on more than dollars saved.andP;  The decision to contractall or part of a network's maintenance requires examination of a company'soverall goals.andM;The current rationale for contracting maintenance of the corporate highway isa trend that calls for companies to &quot;vertically deintegrate&quot;--that is, tocontract out any activities that are not related directly to its corebusiness.andM;In fact, contracting out these services looks so financially appealing thatit could make the traditional network manager obsolete.andP;  A report by GartnerGroup, a Stamford, Conn.-based research and consulting company, states thatmost companies' voice communication costs are growing by about 4 percet peryear, and data communications costs by about 35 percent.andP;  The reportconcludes that it's only a matter of time until chief financial officerslooking for the largest areas of growth and costs will seek to cutexpenditures in theseareas.andM;The report suggests that network maintenance vendors will soon bypass thetraditional MIs managers; instead, they will knock directly on the door ofthe CFO, armed with figures to show the cost-effectiveness of outsidemaintenance services and challenging in-house managers to beat their prices.andM;An information systems (IS) manager who strongly believes that total controlover the network is critical to maintaining his company's competitive edgeshould analyze the maintenance requirements of his company's network andprepare a strategy that makes fiscal sense and protects the company's controlover any critical network services.andM;Proponents of in-house network maintenance argue that outside providers mightnot always take the client's inerests to heart.andP;  For example, maintenanceproviders might try to persuade a company to purchase equipment sold by thatprovider, even fi the equipment has been made obsolete by other systems onthe market.andM;In fact, account control has become such a major issue that large computercompanies are pouring millions of dollars into developing system integrationand maintenance operations.andM;A report by the Ledgeway Group, a market research and consulting company inLexington, Mass., estimates that the market for facilities and operationsmanagement was $1.05 billion last year.andP;  This segment is expected to grow12.9 percent per year into the early 1990s, reaching $1.65 billion in 1992.andM;Although the market is expected to expand, right now the only playersoffering viable, one-stop multivendor network maintenance services arecompanies like DEC, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, or system integrators such asEDS and Andersen Consulting.andP;  Traditional third-party maintenance suppliersclearly recognize the opportunities, but many are as yet unable to marshalthe resources required to provide these services on a large scale.andP;  Today,most traditional third-party maintenance providers only offer services suchas remote monitoring to alert network managers when a problem is detected.andO;For example, one network maintenance vendor offers 24-by-7 remote monitoringand diagnostic services for multivendor networks for between $10,000 and$20,000 per month, and 8-by-5 multivendor service for between $7,000 and$14,000 per month.andM;Without truly viable alternatives, proponents of in-house maintenance warn, acompany could find itself saddled for years with a contracted networkmaintenance staff whose first loyality is to the provider, not to thecustomer.andM;They argue that a network maintenance company has to keep a sharp eye on itsown costs.andP;  Thus, the provider is likely to manage a network to maximize itsprofit rather than to support the customer's particular strategic advantage.andO;In highly competitive, service-oriented industries, where the latest networktechnology determines the company's competitive edge, relying on outside helpfor any part of the network can become a disadvantage.andP;  This is especiallytrue if the organization's maintenance provider pushes its own products eventhough its competitors' products are more state-of-the-art.andM;As outside sourcing of network maintenance becomes more popular, networkmanagers who advocate total control over their networks will be asked tojustify the cost of in-house maintenance.andM;Managers should justify network resources and services in terms of basicaccounting and cost-recovery analyses.andP;  These techniques will enable acompany to evaluate its network's efficiency, services and support, and tomake appropriate adjustments to increase productivity and decrease costs.andO;Calculating per-unit costs for in-house network maintenance services willprovide managers with specifications against which to solicit bids.andM;Per-unit costs can be calculated by adding the cost of capital, line chargesand personnel, and then dividing the sum by the number of networktransactions.andP;  These transactions can be measured as the number of packetstransmitted across the network over a given period of time.andM;By determining per-unit costs, a company can make comparisons on anapples-to-apples basis when negotiating with an outside supplier.andP;  If acompany knows what it costs to provide certain services, then it can insistthat potential suppliers provide bids in similar units.andM;The company will also be able to assess what cost reductions in networkmaintenance can be made in-house and which reductions would be achieved moreeffectively through an outside supplier.andP;  Moreover, the data can clarify howcosts could be decreased over a five-year span, giving the company grounds toinsist that potential vendors achieve the same decrease.andM;According to Real Decisions Corp. (RDC), an IS analytical consulting servicein Darien, Conn., IS is most effective if it's run as a business within abusiness.andP;  By measuring the costs of services provided and charging users forthem, IS can ensure that its resources are providing the greatest benefit tothe corporation as a whole.andM;The following methodology, developed by RDC, outlines the work involved in anaccurate evaluation.andM;The first task is to gather information about the existing network and ensurethat all parties understand its current state.andP;  This is achieved by takinginventory of and evaluating services, support and current charge-backmethods, supplemented by a description of the network's hardware and currentstaff requirements.andM;Quality of service, customer satisfaction, support offerings andapplications, and end-user assistance should be noted, as well as whether thecompany considers its MIS operations on a profit, cost or break-even basis.andO;Budget review procedures and cost allocations for personnel, circuits,software and hardware should also be considered.andM;The next phase involves analyzing the current charge-back method to assesseffectiveness in recovering network-related costs.andM;Data networks would be evaluated on cost distribution, measurements of costper element, network hardware utilization, traffic statistics, personnelmetrics, work distribution and change management.andP;  This overall evaluationshould be conducted at least annually, supplemented by continual monitoring,assessments and adjustments.andM;For between $10,000 and $30,000, a consulting company can be contracted tooversee this evaluation and provide cost comparisons with other companies.andO;Although a simpler cost analysis based on salaries and overhead can providejustification for purchase of certain network maintenance options, the RDCmethod generally goes farther, arming network managers with the informationneeded to provide network services in the most cost-effective manner.andP;  Itwill also help managers provide per-unit in-house costs against which networkmaintenance vendors can bid, providing a true comparison of availableresources.andM;In bidding processes where the customer knows the per-unit costs for in-housenetwork maintenance services, each support vendor should be asked to show howit could reduce the per-unit cost while increasing-efficiency during the lifeof the contract--after all, that is no less than would be asked of anin-house maintenance staff.andM;When bidding, vendors often offer incentives for long-term agreements.andP;  Butit's extremely important to evaluate this type of contract painstakinglybefore committing.andP;  Often, there are substantial penalties for breaking thecontract.andP;  For example, one company's $400,000-per-year network maintenancecontract carries a $50,000 charge for early withdrawal--a penalty of morethan 12 percent.andP;  Furthermore, the withdrawal--a penalty of more than 12percent.andP;  Furthermore, the withdrawal expense is compounded by that ofbringing the maintenance responsibilities back in-house.andM;In the long run, companies will do well to evaluate and streamline theirnetwork operations, determine a cost structure for internal billing and,based on their findings, contract out the appropriate portions of networkmaintenance.andM;Maintenance strategies adopted slowlyandM;Contracting out maintenance is a common practice, but managers at VAX sitesare farming out only small percentages of their network maintenance tasks,according to a recent DR Stragegies survey.andP;  The most popular solution,chosen by 40 percent of the respondents, was to maintain the network with acombination of in-house staff and support from outside suppliers.andM;The survey is based on questions asked of 100 VAX sites selected randomlyfrom a list provided by Computer Intelligence, a market research company inLa Jolla, Calif., and compiled by Beta Research of Syossett, N.Y.andM;According to the survey, the percentage of FAX site respondents that contractout between 25 and 75 percent of their network maintenance will grow only 2percent next year, reflecting the general difficulty many maintenance vendorsare having in gearing up to service this market.andP;  The choices among vendorsis still limited.andM;Of the 40 percent that said their strategy consisted of some combination ofoutside supplier services and in-house staff, the manufacturing industryrepresented the largest segment, at 35 percent, and the academic communityrepresented another 25 percent of that group.andM;Eighty-seven percent of those using both outside supplier services andin-house staff said reliability was a factor that influenced their choice.andO;Flexibility came in as the second most influential factor, getting the nodfrom 75 percent of this group.andM;Although 63 percent of the respondents said reliability was their greatestconcern with their present networking strategy, 38 percent didn't know howmuch one hour of downtime costs their company.andM;Of all the respondents, 53 percent said they have experienced no networkdowntime, and one percent said their network is down from 10 to 15 hours amonth.andM;The survey also pointed out that the median salary for network maintenancestaff technicians is $35,400, and that on the average, the group spent$142,000 on network maintenance each year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
