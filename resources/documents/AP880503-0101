(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer expert who worked for acompany that helps operate the Pennsylvania state lottery printed afake ticket so that he and a friend could share a $15.2 millionjackpot, state officials said today.   Henry Rich used a computer at his firm, Control Data Corp., toprint a copy of the winning ticket, then gave it to Mark S. Herbst,state Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman said at a news conferencetoday.   The ticket listed the winning numbers for the Super 7 lotterydrawing last July 15. One winning ticket to that jackpot was soldstatewide, but the winner had never claimed the prize.   When he came forward last week Herbst claimed he had kept theticket in a cigar box, then used it as a bookmark until recentstories about the unclaimed prize led him to double-check thenumbers.   Herbst cashed the ticket last Thursday and received a $469,989check for the first installment. State officials quickly detectedthe attempted fraud, however, and the money was never paid,Zimmerman said.   Rich, a computer expert at Control Data, which works with thestate lottery, has been charged with theft by unlawful taking,theft by deception, conspiracy, forgery, tampering with publicinformation and unlawful use of a computer, Zimmerman said. Rich isbeing held in Dauphin County Prison.   Zimmerman said Herbst was in custody this morning and would becharged later in the day.   James Scroggins, executive director of the lottery, said theforgery was traced because Herbst's ticket was printed on paperthat was returned to the state by a lottery-ticket agent inScranton, while computer records showed the unclaimed winningticket was actually sold in Bucks County.   Scroggins admitted that some lottery officials had doubts aboutthe validity of the ticket, but he said he decided to award theprize anyway because the computer validation code on the bogusticket was accurate.   By 4:30 p.m. Thursday, Zimmerman said lottery officials knew theticket was fake and stopped payment on the check, which Herbst haddeposited in several accounts at a local bank.   Agents from Zimmerman's office confronted Herbst on Sunday.Zimmerman said Herbst told the agents Rich was expecting $5,000from him Monday.   On Monday night, Zimmerman said, Herbst gave Rich $5,000provided by the state. Rich, who was armed, tried to flee whenagents moved in, but he was captured without incident, theprosecutor said.   This is the second fixing case to plague the PennsylvaniaLottery. The April 24, 1980 drawing of the Daily Number was fixedby altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits.   The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, alsoresulted in tighter security procedures for the televised drawings.Scroggins said new procedures would also be implemented because ofthe new case.</TEXT></DOC>
