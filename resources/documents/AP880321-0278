PLC has beenordered to pay $1.36 million in fines for violating health andsafety laws in connection with two refinery blasts that killedthree men and seriously injured two others, the government saidMonday.   The fine was the highest ever levied under the Health and Safetyat Work Act enacted in 1974, officials said.   High Court Judge Lord Allanbridge said he imposed ``substanial''fines because ``there were obvious hazards to the safety and livesof employees and others'' at the refinery near Falkirk in centralScotland where the explosions occurred nine days apart in March1987.   The company pleaded guilty to two charges of breaking the healthand safety act.   After the ruling, the government's chief inspector forfactories, David Eves, said the explosions showed ``the everpresent potential for serious incidents must not beunderestimated.''   He said in a statement that ``these incidents .... cost thelives of three men, as well as a great deal of human suffering andthe loss to the management of the company of millions of pounds inlost production and plant repairs.''   Company officials were not available for comment Monday evening.   The judge fined the company 250,000 pounds ($455,000) for thefirst explosion, which was heard 20 miles away and hurled athree-ton steel plate more than half a mile.   The first blast occurred when workers from two subcontractorsbegan taking apart a section of machinery that had not been drainedof flammable gases and liquids.   Liquid began leaking out and then exploded, killing James Bruce,40, and Philip Mellon, 35, and seriously injuring Ian Taylor andAllan Bissett. The fire took two days to put out.   In the second incident, BP was fined 500,000 pounds ($910,000)for disconnecting a safety alarm at another unit where an explosionand fire killed George Spiers, 52.</TEXT></DOC>
