Arias was the opposition's firstvice-presidential candidate in the May 7 elections that wereannulled by the government, controlled by Defense Forces chiefManuel Antonio Noriega.   Arias, his running mates and international observers claim thatthe opposition won the election. The opposition claims thegovernment nullified the vote to prevent the opposition from takingpower.   He, presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and secondvice-presidential candidate Guillermo Ford were beaten byparamilitary Noriega supporters during a demonstration on May 10.   During his visit to the United States, he criticized Gen.Noriega's rule during a gathering of the Organization of AmericanStates in Washington. The opposition supports the ouster of Noriega.   During the meeting Arias also criticized the OAS's decision onWednesday to give six more weeks to a OAS mediation group to come upwith a plan for the democratic transfer of power in Panama.   Arias did not tell journalists what he was asked during theinterrogation. Arias was questioned by Panamanian immigrationofficials, who belong to the Defense Forces, then later wasinterrogated by military officials.   The U.S. government first imposed economic sanctions againstNoriega in 1988 after his indictment on U.S. charges of drugtrafficking.   Noriega denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S.government plot to renege on treaties that will transfer power ofthe Panama Canal from the United States to Panama and require theU.S. government to abandon its military bases around the canal bythe year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
