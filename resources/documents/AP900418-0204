Tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this monththe policy will not change. Kenya did the same and Zimbabwe'sleader, Robert Mugabe, declared his intention to install one-partyrule.   ``If we have many political parties, we will have chaos asdifferent tribes rush to form theirs,'' President Daniel arap Moiof Kenya told trainee teachers at Laikipia in central Kenya.``Tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in theminds of many Kenyans.''   ``For now, I say no to the multiparty system, at least until weare cohesive enough as a nation,'' he said.   Kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million. Ethnicfeuding is common in Parliament, at public rallies and in the press.   Moi, a 66-year-old a former teacher from the minority Kalenjintribe, inherited the one-party system in 1978 from the latePresident Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's founder. Kenyatta had bannedopposition parties nine years earlier.   Kenyatta created a de facto one-party state by locking up hispolitical opponents. Moi made it constitutional in 1982.   The president's statement was his first on the subject sincesome other African states began considering more liberalizedpolitical systems this year.   He spoke after weeks of debate in Nairobi newspapers aboutwhether Kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed toKenyatta when he led the former British colony to independence in1963.   Writers supporting the status quo argued that Kenya hadprospered under the current system, without tribal strife. Theysaid a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence anddrive away tourists and investors.   Those who wanted change said Kenyans were politically matureenough for competition, that recent reforms in eastern Europeshould be used as an example and that a parliamentary oppositionwould help check official corruption, mismanagement and nepotism.   Neighboring Tanzania, a nation of 100 tribes, also was a Britishcolony until independence in 1961 under Julius Nyerere.   Unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin, Tanzania followedsocialism based on Eastern European models. Both Nyerere and AliHassan Mwinyi, who succeeded him as president in 1985, haveadmitted the policies were flawed.   Mwinyi, 65, has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed byWestern lenders, but has rejected suggestions that they beaccompanied by political change.   ``While a multiparty system would be suitable for Europeans, itmight not be the same with Tanzania,'' Mwinyi told reporters in Dares Salaam.   ``What Africans want is a fair return for their sweat through anew international economic order. ... This cannot be solved by thecreation of 100 parties, which can bring chaos instead ofprogress.''   He said Tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party asa way to guarantee national unity. He did not mention a statementNyerere made in February that multiparty democracy now may bepossible.   Nyerere, still chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party,remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned aspresident.   Only a few of the 50 member nations of the Organization ofAfrican Unity have Western-style democracies.   Zimbabwe is one, but President Robert Mugabe declared after anoverwhelming victory in recent national elections that he willtransform the former British colony of Rhodesia into a one-partystate.   Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago, said theelections were a mandate from the 4.8 million registered voters toget rid of the opposition.   His opponents accused Mugabe, 66, of seeking a dictatorship.They noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted andopposition parties got 20 percent of the votes, although they wononly three of the 150 Parliament seats.   Benin, a former French colony, is pledged to eliminate one-partyrule, Gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in theIvory Coast for a freer political order.   Cameroon and Niger, scenes of recent political upheavals, haverejected multiparty politics.   Significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters.   Ethiopia and Mozambique have abandoned their hardline Marxistideologies, and the Marxist leaders of Angola have committedthemselves to peace talks with U.S.-backed guerrillas that, iffruitful, could lead to open elections.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thursday AMs, April 26</NOTE></DOC>
