Also, state-run media said Sunday the government will requirepeople who are granted travel visas by foreign countries to obtaintwo exit permits from the Chinese government instead of one.   The move, apparently aimed at keeping dissidents from fleeing,requires citizens to obtain exit permits before and after they applyfor visas. In recent days, large crowds seeking visas have formedoutside foreign embassies.   Qiao Shi, a standing member of the Politburo, told a meeting ofnon-party officials Saturday that ``it is very natural that peoplehave different views and doubts'' under the current ``complicated ''situation.   The comments, reported Sunday by the official People's Dailynewspaper, were more conciliatory than past remarks by hardlinerswho now control the Communist Party.   Since the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations this month,the government has been waging a nationwide campaign to compelgreater loyalty to the party.   The newspaper quoted Qiao as saying the party would continue topromote socialist democracy and improve the legal system.   The front-page coverage strengthened speculation that Qiao willreplace Zhao Ziyang as general secretary of the 47 million-memberparty. The party Central Committee is expected to meet soon toformalize Zhao's ouster.   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power after opposingthe decision by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng todeclare martial law in Beijing on May 20.   The subsequent June 3-4 military attack on Beijing claimed up to3,000 lives, according to Chinese witnesses and Western intelligencereports. The Chinese said about 300 died, including many soldiers.   Qiao has kept a low profile during his long career as a partyadministrator, but is generally considered a conservative because ofhis record as head of internal security and party discipline.   The national television news reported 10 more arrests ofprotesters, including three identified as students. Two were said tobe leaders of an independent student group representing universitiesfrom outside Beijing.   The third, Liu Huan, identified as a spokesman for the studentmovement, was accused of absconding with 17,000 yuan, about $4,600,in student funds.   More than 1,300 people have been arrested for rioting andcounterrevolutionary activities following nationwide uprisingssparked by the military invasion of Beijing.   The Beijing Daily said Sunday that Yang Tao, a Beijing Universitystudent and one of 21 student activists on a nationwide wanted list,was arrested in western Gansu province Saturday.   Yang was the fifth student reported to have been arrested or tohave turned himself in since the list was published June 13.   A Beijing court Saturday sentenced seven men and one woman todeath for beating soldiers and burning vehicles during the militarytakeover, which met the resistance of thousands of Beijing residents.   They were the first to receive the death sentence for battlingtroops during the army assault on Beijing. Three Shanghai menearlier were sentenced to die for setting fire to a train that ranthrough a barricade set up by protesters in Shanghai, killing sixpeople.   The condemned have three days to appeal their sentences, althoughstays of execution are rare. Execution in China is by a bullet tothe back of the head.   The People's Daily also carried a letter from a legal expertsaying the United States was violating both Chinese andinternational law by sheltering dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife,Li Shuxian.   Chen Weidian, vice president of the China Law Society, said it isnormal international practice that foreign embassies don't use theirpremises to shelter criminals.   Fang, a astrophysicist and prominent dissident, fled to the U.S.Embassy after the military crackdown. The Chinese government laterordered his arrest and has accused the U.S. government ofinterfering in China's internal affairs by protecting him.</TEXT></DOC>
