As a result of the proposed disapproval and the possibilityof a construction ban which could result from a final disapproval, theTexas Air Control Board (TACB) developed a Post-82 ``Interim'' SIP whichwas submitted to EPA by the Governor of Texas on December 21, 1987. Basedon the subsequent efforts and cooperation put forth by the State of Texas,and the additional control measures and commitments in the Post-82 InterimSIP, EPA today defers the proposed finding that Texas did not adequatelyrevise its Post-1982 SIP and thus defers the proposed sanctions, pendingsuccessful and timely completion of each of the commitments outlined inthe Post-82 Interim SIP. Despite deferral of sanctions, additional SIPrevisions will be required for the DFW area in accordance with the May26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call. Texas has begun to meet the requirements ofthe May 26, 1988, SIP call by committing to develop an emission inventoryand revise and adopt by July 21, 1989, the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)regulations in Texas Air Control Board Rule 115 in accordance with EPA'sguidance document ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies,and Deviations, May 25, 1988.'' Today's notice also proposes to approve the stationary source volatileorganic compound (VOC) regulation revisions associated with the initialPost-82 SIP and the Interim SIP to the extent that they represent an improvementover the previously approved regulations. The rule revisions, however,do not in all cases constitute Reasonable Available Control Technology(RACT) as required in SIP call areas and are not being proposed for approvalas RACT. The notice also proposes to approve the commitments to the gasolinevolatility program, the commitments related to the Inspection and Maintenance(I/M) Program, the commitments to the Transportation Control Measures (TCMs),the contingency provisions, and the schedules for the VOC regulation revisionand I/M program submitted as part of the Post-82 Interim SIP. EPA proposesto defer action on the submitted pollution control strategy demonstrationas a whole since the modeled required reduction reflected in the InterimSIP was based on a 1983 base year emission inventory which Texas is nowin the process of updating as the initial step toward meeting the May 26,1988, SIP call requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before March 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Copies of the State submission are available for inspectionduring normal business hours at the following locations: EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Region VI, Air Programs Branch, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas,Texas 75202; Texas Air Control Board, 6330 Highway 290 East, Austin, Texas78723.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Rebecca Caldwell, Air ProgramsBranch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue,Dallas, Texas 75202, (214) 655-7214, (FTS) 255-7214; Texas Air ControlBoard, 6330 Highway 290 East, Austin, Texas 78723.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On February 24, 1984, the EPA Region6 Regional Administrator notified the Governor of Texas that the SIP theState had developed under Part D of the Act to demonstrate attainment byDecember 31, 1982, was inadequate to attain the O<T2>3</T2> standard for Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. An additionalSIP revision call was made in 1984 for Denton County, Texas, based on reviewof the O<T2>3</T2> data through December 1983. In response to the 1984 SIP call,Texas submitted revisions for Dallas and Tarrant Counties in 1985 and 1986.However, the revisions did not provide for sufficient and enforceable VOCemission reductions to attain the O<T2>3</T2> NAAQS. Based on the EPA's judgment in 1987 that Texas had failedto adequately carry out the requirements to revise its SIP after EPA hadcalled for a SIP revision under section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act, EPA proposedon July 14, 1987, to impose a ban under section 173(4) of the Act on permittingnew or modified major VOC sources. EPA also proposed, however to approvethe anti-tampering vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program andcertain Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) in the initial Post-82 SIPas helpful toward attaining the standard. This action is being finalizedelsewhere in today's<T4> Federal Register.</T4> For important background information on today'snotice, see 52 FR 26421, July 14, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">State Action </ITAG>At the August 14, 1987, TACB Board meeting, the Board members directedits staff to prepare a Post-82 Interim SIP revision to address the emissionshortfall and regulation concerns with the initial Post-82 SIP revisionssubmitted to EPA in 1985 and 1986. Texas held a public meeting on August 13, 1987, in Arlington, Texas andpublished a notice for public hearing on the proposed Interim SIP revisionin the Texas Register. Public hearings were held on October 28, 1987, inCleburne and Rockwall, Texas. On October 29, 1987, hearings were conductedin Arlington, Texas. The TACB and EPA Region 6 met on several occasions to discuss correctionsneeded to the existing 1985 and 1986 SIP revisions as well as revisionsneeded to Regulation V, Volatile Organic Compound Regulations, specificallyRACT requirements, test methods, recordkeeping requirements, alternativemeasures, applicability, and enforceability measures. The meeting dateswere January 28, February 10, February 24, and March 23, 1988. TACB heldpublic hearings June 28-30, 1988, for additional necessary Regulation Vrevisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Control Strategy </ITAG>1. Emission Data The emission inventory used in the Post-82 Interim SIP was the 1983 baseyear emission inventory used for the initial Post-1982 SIP submitted in1985 and 1986. This inventory was the most current inventory availablefor the Interim SIP submittal due to the time restraints in submittingthe SIP revision by the end of 1987. EPA will defer action on the overallcontrol strategy in the Interim SIP revision since the emission reductionwas based on the 1983 emission inventory, and Texas subsequently committedto develop a more current inventory, for the May 26, 1988, SIP call, whichcould substantially change the quantity of emissions, the control strategy,and the attainment demonstration for the DFW area. Texas has corrected the concerns EPA raised in the July 14, 1987 proposeddisapproval notice regarding the 1983 inventory and modeling in the initialPost-82 SIP. Texas added a NO<T2>x</T2> emission inventory, projected VOC and NO<T2>x</T2> emissions to 1997, based the inventory on a kilogram/day basisto account for summertime weekday emissions, and estimated the mobile sourceemissions with the use of a prototype of the MOBILE 4 model. 2. Modeling Analysis Texas used Level III City Specific EKMA/OZIPP analysis as required by EPAguidance. EPA's concerns raised in the disapproval proposal notice havebeen addressed by the use of a straight line trajectory rather than anactual air parcel trajectory approach. Texas has also used the meteorologicaldata suggested by EPA. With these recommended changes, the model, withthe use of the 1983 emission inventory, predicted that a 43.9% and 41.7%VOC emission reduction for Dallas and Tarrant Counties, respectively, wereneeded to meet the ozone NAAQS by December 1991.3. Areawide Requirements Texas used an areawide I/M approach in the control strategy in order toaccount for emissions from vehicles that commute to Dallas and Tarrantcounties. This area includes the entire Consolidated Metropolitan StatisticalArea (CMSA) which consists of the following counties: Dallas, Tarrant,Parker, Rockwall, Denton, Collin, Johnson, Ellis, and Kaufman. EPA had already made a SIP call for Denton County in 1984. Since that time,monitored ozone exceedances have occurred in Parker, Rockwall, and CollinCounty. EPA made a Post-87 SIP call on May 26, 1988, for the Dallas-FortWorth CMSA which will require all the counties in the CMSA to be addressedin the Post-87 ozone plan for the DFW area. 4. Stationary Source Regulation Revisions As required by the Clean Air Act section 172 and the April 4, 1979, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (44 FR 20372), RACT has been requiredin Dallas and Tarrant Counties for all sources covered by EPA's ControlTechnology Guidelines (CTGs), which include major and minor sources, aswell as all major non-CTG sources. Texas has adopted rules requiring controlof all CTG category sources located in Dallas and Tarrant counties andhas submitted negative declarations for seven of the category sources notlocated in these counties. These rules were submitted in the 1985 submittal.EPA last approved revisions to Regulation V as part of the Harris CountyO<T2>3</T2> SIP on July 28, 1985 (50 FR 26362). Since that time, TACB madeadditional revisions on July 26, 1985 (numerous rules as part of the initialPost-1982 O<T2>3</T2> SIP for Dallas and Tarrant Counties and the Post-82 SIP forEl Paso), March 27, 1985 (automobile and light duty truck surface coatingrule for a source specific alternative compliance plan), November 13, 1987(previous commitment to control sources specifically in Harris County),December 18, 1987, and October 14, 1988 (the last two as part of the Dallasand Tarrant Counties Post-1982 corrective SIP.) As part of the initial Post-82 SIP submittal, TACB adopted on July 26,1985, revisions to TACB's existing regulations controlling VOC loadingand unloading, Stage I vapor recovery, vent gas emissions, cutback asphalt,solvent metal cleaning, certain surface coating operations, perchloroethylenedry cleaning, and gasoline tank truck leaks. The purpose of these revisionswas to impose additional control on those source categories thus gainingadditional VOC emission reductions. EPA's specific comments regarding RegulationV were given to Texas in a November 2, 1987, letter to TACB regarding thedraft regulations submitted September 30, 1987. These comments addressedthose rules that were revised July 26, 1985, and submitted as part of theinitial Post-82 SIP as well as the draft regulations submitted September30, 1987. In response to the May 26, 1988, SIP call, Texas has scheduledto address deficiencies existing in all VOC Regulation V and general rulesand adopt these revisions by July 21, 1989, as they apply to all the SIPcall areas in Texas. Some of these deficiencies have already been addressedfor Dallas and Tarrant Counties as part of the Post-82 Interim SIP submittalas described below. Other federally approved rules which cover VOC storagetanks, petroleum refinery operations, additional surface coating operations,pharmaceutical manufacturing operations, and those which allow source categoriesto petition for source specific compliance plans, that apply in Dallasand Tarrant Counties may need revision similar to those rules discussedin today's notice which should be submitted as part of its initial responseto the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call. On December 18, 1987, TACB adopted more revisions to TACB's regulationscontrolling cutback asphalt, surface coating, and graphic arts (printing).Regulations were also adopted for control of the following three new categoriesof emissions: Architectural coating, automobile refinishing coating, andconsumer-solvent products. On October 14, 1988, TACB adopted revised rulescontrolling VOC loading and unloading, Stage I vapor recovery, water separation,vent gas emissions, cutback asphalt, solvent metal cleaning, surface coating,graphic arts, perchloroethylene dry cleaning, and gasoline tank trucks.These revisions include the addition of specific test methods and recordkeepingrequirements for determining and demonstrating continual compliance withthe rule, and the deletion of or modification to exemptions from the rules.For further details on these regulation revisions refer to the TechnicalSupport Document (TSD). Additionally, on November 13, 1987, regulation revisions were submittedby the Governor to EPA independently of the other DFW regulation revisions.They pertain to the Harris County 1982 SIP only. Therefore, EPA will takeaction separately on the November 13, 1987, adoption, specifically RegulationV Sections 115.163(b)(2)(A), 115.163(b)(2)(B), and 115.261-115.265. Today's notice will act upon the VOC regulations that are applicable toDallas and Tarrant Counties as they appear after the October 14, 1988,TACB adoption which was submitted to EPA on December 13, 1988. EPA believesthe last two sets of adopted VOC revisions (October 14, 1988, and December18, 1987) create an overall set of rules that are much clearer, more enforceable,and more effective in reducing VOC emissions in Dallas and Tarrant Countiesthan were previous versions. These revisions strengthen the SIP; however,EPA is not concluding that these rules represent RACT in all cases. TheMay 26, 1988, SIP call requires Texas to further revise, as indicated below,VOC regulations included in today's action. Also, the SIP call requiresTexas to revise all VOC Regulation V and general rules applying to allozone SIP call areas in Texas in accordance with the deficiencies EPA notedin its June 9, 1988, letter to TACB and in accordance with the EPA document``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations,May 25, 1988.'' Therefore, EPA is not now proposing approval of these specificrules as RACT. The rules are proposed for approval because they are a majorimprovement over previous versions. Some major deficiencies still existingwith these rules included in today's action are listed as follows.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Exemption Levels</ITAG> The Clean Air Act requires that both major and minor VOC sources in Dallasand Tarrant Counties falling under any of the Control Technique Guideline(CTG) categories must meet RACT level control requirements. ``Major'' sourcesare those emitting greater than or equal to 100 tons per year (tpy) ofVOC and ``minor'' sources are those emitting less than 100 tpy. CTG's andother EPA guidance may establish exemption levels for some source categoriesbased on conditions specific to certain sources such as production rateor size/type of equipment while other categories have no defined exemptionlevels or lower bounds. Certain processes such as cold solvent metal cleaningand degreasing apply to all operations no matter what the emission rate.For the surface coating categories, RACT should apply to all sources withactual daily VOC emissions of 15 pounds or greater summed from all surfacecoating operations in that category. Texas has chosen to require all sources emitting 15 pounds VOC or greaterper consecutive 24 hour period to utilize compliant coatings when available.Further, sources greater than this limit but less than 100 pounds VOC emissionsin any consecutive 24 hour period are not required to use add-on controlequipment in the absence of compliant coatings. This is a partial applicationof RACT. Sources greater than the 100 pounds per day level must fully applyRACT such as compliant coatings or use of add-on control equipment to meetthe emission limitation specified in the regulation. While this is a partial application of RACT per EPA's past guidance, ithas merit. First, it is an improvement over Texas' prior exemption of allsources less than 100 pounds VOC per day. Second, the State contends thatrequiring sources emitting 15 pounds VOC per day to retrofit with incineratorsis economically infeasible. Texas contends that requiring add-on controlsfor all surface coating sources would not reflect RACT. However, Texashas not evaluated each source on a case-by-case basis to determine if othercontrol options are feasible. EPA proposes today to approve this revisedexemption level because it represents an improvement over the previouslyapproved regulation. The rule does not represent RACT and EPA is requiringTACB in the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call to reevaluate RACT on a sourcespecific basis.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Continuous Applicability</ITAG> It is EPA's position that once a source becomes subject to a rule by emittingor operating above the applicability cutoff, it must meet the requirementsfrom that time forward (``once-in-always-in''). EPA believes that to effectivelycontrol VOC emissions, a source must continuously apply RACT level controlseven if its day-to-day operation alternates above and below the exemptionlevel. Texas has not clearly stated that once sources are subject to a RACT levelregulation or equivalent limitations, they shall always be subject to thoserequirements. This deficiency is particularly important with respect toTexas' VOC loading and unloading, surface coating, and vent gas controlregulations. EPA is today proposing to approve revisions to these regulationsbecause they represent an improvement over the previous approved regulation.The rules, however, do not represent RACT and Texas must further revisethis rule as required by the May 26, 1988, SIP call. A state may choose to limit a source to operate below the emission oroperation cutoff rate. Texas may wish to do this through issuance of aBoard Order or other federally enforceable mechanism and should providethe enforceable mechanism to EPA as a SIP revision for approval by EPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative Test Methods </ITAG>In numerous instances, the Texas rules allow the TACB to approve test methodswhich are alternatives to the EPA reference methods. EPA requires the useof EPA approved test methods as detailed in 40 CFR Part 60. Texas has specifiedthese methods where applicable, with the exception of allowing the useof ``equivalent test methods approved by the Executive Director of theTACB.'' EPA requires such equivalent methods to be submitted as SIP revisionssince the integrity of a control strategy rests largely on the requirementsof the specific rule and on agreeing on universal, replicable, and reliabletest methods to determine if operations and emissions are in compliance.The control strategy also depends on assuring the effective reductionsin emissions called for by the rule in the ozone strategy. Texas chosenot to specify that these alternatives be approved by EPA. Texas is requiredby the May 26, 1988, SIP call, to remove this alternative test method provisionor state that they will submit alternative methods in accordance with SIPrevision protocol for EPA approval. Similarly, Section 115.163(e) allowsalternate methods of demonstrating and documenting compliance to be approvedby the Executive Director of the TACB. EPA likewise requires such alternativesmethods to be submitted as a SIP revision to ensure consistency with therule and not compromise the future effectiveness of this regulation. EPAtoday proposes to approve the various revisions which add test method requirements;however, compliance with the federally enforceable requirements of theSIP will be determined only by the approved EPA and ASTM test methods statedin the rules until Texas makes these required revisions. EPA is also proposingapproval of the revisions to the General Vent Gas Rule (115.163) exceptfor that part of the rule which allows discretionary approval.  Compliance with the SIP will be judged only by those provisions and criteriaspecified in 115.163 without consideration of the discretionary approvalallowed by 115.163(e) until the State revises this rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative Compliance Methods and Requirements </ITAG>Similarly, the current Regulation V rules allow TACB to approve alternativecompliance methods or requirements on petition by the source on a case-by-casebasis. Alternative compliance methods are allowed under Section 115.401of Regulation V. Such alternatives should achieve the same quantity of(equivalent) reductions intended by the rule and must not be used to avoidmore stringent RACT level control. In cases where a surface coating operationclaims it cannot meet the requirements, Section 115.193(c)(6) gives TACBthe authority to specify alternative emission limits. As with the alternativetest methods described above, EPA requires that any of these two alternatives,or other revisions, approved by the State be submitted to EPA for its reviewand approval as a SIP revision rather than generically be considered apart of the SIP upon State adoption. Texas has not clearly stated in itsrules which alternate compliance methods and requirements will be submittedas SIP revisions or how such petitions must demonstrate compliance withthe underlying SIP. Therefore, Texas must clearly state in the responseto the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call that alternative compliance methodsunder either of the aforementioned sections require EPA approval as SIPrevisions in order that they be recognized as part of the SIP. In the absenceof such case-by-case SIP approval, the specified enforceable requirementsof the SIP will be the emission limits or the reduction requirements, thecontinual compliance requirements, and the methods and timeframes statedin the rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">Non CTG Major Sources </ITAG>The Clean Air Act, as interpreted in EPA's Post-82 SIP revision guidance,requires that all major non-CTG VOC sources in Dallas and Tarrant Countieshave specific RACT applied to them. Major non-CTG sources are those whosetotal unregulated emissions equal 100 tons per year or more. Texas submitteddocumentation on March 11, 1988, showing that all major non-CTG sourcesin Dallas and Tarrant Counties are subject to control requirements foundin Regulation V or that such controls are economically infeasible. Texasregulates these sources as well as smaller sources by controlling all ventgas streams greater than 100 pounds per day and greater than 0.009 psiatrue partial pressure (612 ppm). This rule requires any vent, regardlessof the origin of the VOC emissions, to incinerate the vent emissions ifthe quantity or concentration are greater than the limits described above.EPA intends that RACT be applied to the process which is the source ofthe VOC emissions and not just the vents. Controls resulting in additionalVOC reduction beyond incineration must be evaluated. These controls includeuse of improved work practices, process requirements, or improved fugitiveVOC capture. EPA encourages TACB to continue their evaluation of source specific futurecontrol requirements for non-CTG major sources beyond incineration. EPAis proposing to approve revisions to the Vent Gas rule for Dallas and TarrantCounties as an improvement over the previous version and is allowing Texasadditional time to develop industry specific RACT level controls in theresponse to the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Compliance Date</ITAG> Texas submitted revisions to its automobile surface coating rule, Section115.191(a)(8), in the initial Post-82 SIP. Those revisions contained provisionssuch as allowing monthly averaging of coating emissions and a new compliancedate which extended the final compliance date by one year. Some of theprovisions in the Interim SIP revisions submitted on December 13, 1988,including monthly averaging, have been deleted by the State at EPA's request,but the extended compliance date has not been changed. While EPA considersthe revisions to be an improvement to the rule, the later compliance dateallowed by Texas is a relaxation. EPA proposes to approve this rule sinceit is an improvement over the previous regulation, however, this revisedregulation is not being approved as RACT and EPA is not proposing to approvethe compliance date extension. Therefore, the date for compliance in thefederally approved regulation remains December 31, 1986. 5. I/M Requirements Texas submitted in the Post-82 Interim SIP a proposed expanded vehicleinspection and maintenance (I/M) program. The Interim SIP commits to expandthe parameter I/M program to include the surrounding counties in the CMSA,which includes Denton County, and to expand the program in Dallas and TarrantCounties to include an idle exhaust emissions check. The TACB has committedto seek additional legislative authority to include the perimeter countiesin the I/M program, to seek the additional resources needed by the TexasDepartment of Public Safety to administer the new expansions in the I/Mprogram, and to adopt final rules. Texas must complete the remainder of the expanded I/M program before EPAcan complete review of the program for approvability. Additionally, EPAmust finish the criteria for what constitutes an enhanced 1/M program anddetermine if Texas's program meets the criteria. TACB's efforts towardcompletion of the expanded I/M program are on the schedule outlined inthe Post-82 Interim SIP submittal. A public hearing was held on July 26, 1988, in Arlington, Texas, concerningrevisions to Regulation IV, Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles.EPA provided comments on the revisions to Regulation IV at that time. Therevisions included the addition of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide cutpointsfor the emissions check and the addition of specific conditions for acceptablevehicle engine and catalytic converter replacement. Elsewhere in today'sFR is a notice approving the parameter I/M program submitted in the originalPost-82 SIP in 1985 and 1986 for Dallas and Tarrant counties. 6. Transportation Control Measure (TCMs) In the July 14, 1987, FR notice, EPA proposed approval of the TCM measuressubmitted in the initial Post-82 SIP revision contingent upon documentationof the evaluation of the TCMs specified under section 108(f) of the CleanAir Act. Texas submitted acceptable documentation in the Interim SIP. Therefore,EPA is approving these Post-82 TCM measures elsewhere in this FR. The Post-82 Interim SIP revision provides for additional TCMs for Dallasand Tarrant Counties. The TCMs to be implemented include intersection signalimprovements and a travel demand management program which together arepredicted to reduce VOC emissions by 3181 kg/day in Dallas County and 1591kg/day in Tarrant County. These measures satisfy EPA's prior guidance onTCMs and Texas has committed in the SIP to implement these measures orothers at a minimum reduction level of 20% per year in a five year timeframe.Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the additional TCM measures committedto in the Post-82 Interim SIP. 7. Gasoline Volatility Control Program Texas commits to controlling the volatility of all gasoline marketed foruse in motor vehicles during the summer ozone season in Dallas and TarrantCounties. Texas has taken credit for VOC reductions obtainable if EPA'sproposed nationwide gasoline volatility program (52 FR 31274, August 19,1987) is finalized. If EPA does not finalize its action by May 16, 1989,then Texas has committed to initiate rulemaking for control of gasolinevolatility in the Dallas and Tarrant County area for implementation inMay 1990.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In the event that EPA publishes a final volatility rulethat differs from the proposed rule, EPA will assess the impact of sucha rule on the Texas commitment to initiate rulemaking, and whether staterulemaking would raise any issues under section 211(c)(4) of the CleanAir Act regarding federal preemption. Texas has estimated reductions using EPA's results from a prototype ofMOBILE 4. EPA's concerns raised in the July 14, 1987, proposal have beenaddressed with this new modeling analysis. Reductions were estimated forinuse motor vehicles which will result from lower evaporative losses dueto a lower RVP during normal operation and hot-soak conditions and fromstationary source reductions which occur from all gasoline marketing operationswhen fuel is stored, transferred, or dispensed. EPA is proposing to approvethis commitment as part of the Post-82 Interim SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Schedules </ITAG>Texas submitted schedules in the Interim SIP that outlined the milestonesthat were to be completed in the future in order to carry out SIP commitments.The schedules were for Regulation V review, modifications, and adoption,and for commitments to fulfill the I/M and TCM requirements. The commitmentshave been carried out to date. These schedules are proposed to be approvedas part of the Post-82 Interim SIP and can be found in the Technical SupportDocument. <ITAG tagnum="84">Contingency Provision </ITAG>Texas has included in the Interim SIP a contingency provision to adoptadditional control measures in order to demonstrate attainment if the VOCcontrol measures committed to in the SIP revisions are insufficient toeffect RFP between 1983 and 1991. This includes a commitment by Texas toadopt a gasoline volatility control program by May 16, 1989, for implementationin May 1990 if EPA fails to take final action on the proposed nationalprogram. It also includes a commitment for additional measures if Texascannot get the appropriate legislative authority and funding to implementthe I/M programs. EPA is proposing to approve this contingency plan aspart of the Post-82 Interim SIP. <ITAG tagnum="84">Post-87 Requirements </ITAG>The Post-82 Interim SIP is not a plan designed to avoid future planningrequirements, such as the requirements of the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIPcall, but is in fact a plan that, when implemented, will substantiallyreduce VOC emissions. Texas has made a first step toward an areawide approachby extending the I/M program to the entire CMSA i.e. the areawide approachis the scope described in the proposed Post-87 guidance published November24, 1987, 52 FR 226. Texas is still required to meet EPA's Post-87 requirementsfor the Dallas-Fort Worth CMSA as identified in the SIP call letter fromEPA on May 26, 1988, associated guidance, and EPA's future policy on Post-87ozone attainment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The original Post-82 submittals in 1985 and 1986 and the Post-82 InterimSIP revisions claim to provide for sufficient VOC emission reductions todemonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS by December 31, 1991. Accordingto EKMA modeling performed in the Interim SIP, the 1983 emissions inventorymust be reduced by 43.9% in Dallas County and 41.7% in Tarrant County.The Post-82 Interim additional revisions provide for a reduction of the1983 base year VOC inventory by 44.3% in Dallas county and 43.4% in Tarrantcounty. Since the percent reductions were determined by a 1983 emissioninventory, EPA is deferring action on the control strategy as a whole untila more current emission inventory and control strategy is developed inresponse to the May 26, 1988, Post-87 SIP call. Based on the efforts andcooperation put forth by the State, the additional adopted measures inthe Interim plan; and Texas' commitment to meet the milestones outlinedin the Interim SIP schedules, EPA is deferring its proposed finding thatTexas had failed to meet the requirements to respond adequately to the1984 SIP call, and thus defers the proposed sanctions pending successfuland timely completion of each of the commitments outlined in the Post-82Interim SIP submitted on December 21, 1987. Despite deferral of this findingand sanctions, additional SIP revisions will be required for the DFW areain accordance with the May 26, 1988, Post-87 Ozone/Carbon Monoxide SIPcall and EPA's future policy on Post-87 ozone attainment. With the qualificationsdescribed above, EPA also proposes to approve the stationary source VOCregulations found in the initial Post-82 SIP and the Interim SIP submittalsas submitted on December 21, 1987 and December 13, 1988, to the extentthat they represent an improvement over the previously approved regulations.The rule revisions, however, do not in all cases constitute RACT as requiredin SIP call areas and are not being proposed for approval as RACT. EPAalso proposes to approve the commitments of the I/M and TCM Program, outlinedin the Post-82 Interim SIP, the Post-82 Interim SIP contingency plan, thegasoline volatility program commitments, and the regulation revision andI/M schedule submitted as part of the Post-82 Interim SIP, because theyare all helpful steps toward attainment of the ozone standard in the DFWarea.
