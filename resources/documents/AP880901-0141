A truck convoy hauled nine Pershing 2 missiles from a base nearStuttgart, and U.S. officials said they would remove the remaining420 medium- and shorter-range missiles from Western Europe in thenext 36 months.   ``This is an important event in post-war history,'' West Germangovernment spokesman Friedhelm Ost told a news conference in Bonn.   The stationing of the missiles had sparked huge protests inWestern Europe, including a coordinated demonstration in severalcities that drew hundreds of thousands of people in October 1983.Deployment of the missiles began the following month.   But the anti-missile fervor waned, and by the time PresidentReagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed their treatybanning intermediate-range nuclear missiles in December, only ahandful of protesters was still active in West Germany.   A group of anti-missile activists who came to witness theremoval applauded as the 15 U.S. Army trucks carrying the missilesleft the Heilbronn site in southern Germany, about 35 miles northof Stuttgart.   They held up a banner saying ``Heilbronn, Never Again A NuclearPowder Keg.''   One 66-year-old woman who had taken part in dozens of protestssaid: ``We have fought, trembled, sung and cried. We were arrestedand taken off in buses. But we've always renewed our courage.'' Shedeclined to give her name.   A rocket motor explosion at Heilbronn in January 1985 killedthree U.S. soldiers and injured 16 others. West German news reportssaid the accident led then-Defense Minister Manfred Woerner topromise residents that Heilbronn would be the first site from whichmissiles would be removed.   U.S. Navy Cmdr. Gerry Ryan of European Command Headquarters inStuttgart told The Associated Press: ``It's the first time thatU.S. intermediate-range missiles have been withdrawn in Europe.   ``The remainder of the U.S. Army European-based,intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removedover a 36-month period,'' he added.   The Soviet Union began removing its missiles from Czechoslovakiaand East Germany in February, before the U.S. Senate had ratifiedthe treaty.   East Germany's official news agency ADN said in March that theSoviets had completed the removal of all 54 shorter-range SS-12missiles, but said nothing about the 53 SS-23 missiles also coveredby the treaty.   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK reported in July thatall of the 39 SS-12 shorter-range missiles based in that countryhad been removed in February and March.   Original NATO plans called for 572 intermediate-range nuclearmissiles in five West European countries to counter the Sovietrockets pointed at the West.   But the United States ultimately deployed only 429 missiles inWest Germany, Britain, Italy and Belgium after plans to station therockets in the Netherlands were scrapped.   Of those deployed, 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruisemissiles were stationed at four bases in West Germany.   One part of the convoy carrying the U.S. missiles headed to aU.S. Army post in Frankfurt, while another was heading to adifferent base ``in preparation for air transport back toelimination sites in the United States,'' Ryan said.   U.S. officials have said that some of the rockets would bedestroyed at the Frankfurt site, and that the nuclear warheadswould be shipped back ``to the appropriate authority,'' in theUnited States.   Under terms of the treaty, the Soviet Union and United Statesagreed to eliminate all land-based nuclear missiles that have arange from 300 to 3,000 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
