(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A century after a crooked Louisianalottery bilked an entire nation, voters in this state will decidewhether to give a new one a chance.   Louisiana voters will consider a constitutional amendmentSaturday ending the state's ban on lotteries. Louisiana stands tobecome the 33rd state to enact a lottery to help finance stategovernment.   The Legislature already has passed a bill establishing aquasi-public corporation, answerable to lawmakers and the governor,to operate the games.   Despite opposition from Gov. Buddy Roemer, the horse racingindustry and others who question its economic value, recent pollsfavor passage.   ``It's a good alternative to the sales tax,'' said state Rep.Raymond Lalonde, who sponsored the measure in the House. ``Thelottery will bring as much as a penny (in sales tax) on milk andbread.''   Opponents led by the Coalition Against Legalizing a Lotteryargue a lottery would drain money from the state's weak economy andtake advantage of the poor.   ``It's a senseless leech on our economy. It's a perniciouscancer on the pocketbooks of the poor,'' said Ed Steimel, acoalition spokesman.   But proponents are so confident of passage that an organizationto push for a lottery was formed only in the past few weeks afteran anti-gambling group began a grass-roots campaign.   Meanwhile, voters in neighboring Arkansas will consider adoptinga lottery on Nov. 6 to boost education funding.   Opponents, including church leaders who denounce it on moralgrounds, hope to get the state Supreme Court to rule it off theballot. A poll commissioned by the Arkansas Democrat and reportedlast week found that 52 percent favor the lottery, 36 percentoppose it and 12 percent are undecided.   Since Louisiana's economy declined along with oil prices in the1980s, the Legislature has routinely renewed a sales tax on foodand utilities to balance the state's books. Such items weretraditionally exempt from the sales tax.   Lotteries have been banned by the Louisiana Constitution since ascandal-plagued private lottery operated in the state during thelate 1800s. Tickets for that operation were sold all over theUnited States, and the people who had been duped complained toWashington.   In 1890, President Benjamin Harrison addressed a special messageto Congress, asking for relief because ``the people of all thestates are debauched and defrauded ... by the Louisiana lottery.''   Congress responded with legislation that blocked the use of themail for selling lottery tickets. Since the lottery sold as much as93 percent of its tickets outside Louisiana, the enterprisecollapsed. That postal prohibition still applies today.   Because of the debacle, there has been deep-rooted opposition toa lottery in Louisiana for years. But favorable sentiment has beengrowing.   Estimates of state revenue for the first full year range from$59 million to $111 million, according to the Public AffairsResearch Council, a research and government watchdog group.   But Steimel said that for the state to net $110 million annuallyfrom a lottery, at least $300 million would have to be wagered -money that otherwise would go into the private economy.   ``We have an economy that is in real deep trouble,'' he said.``Instead of a transfusion, we're getting a blood sucker.''</TEXT></DOC>
