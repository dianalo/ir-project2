In an auditorium packed with outraged union members, localbusiness representatives and other opponents of lastDecember's $121 million award to the U.S. unit of Tokyo-basedSumitomo Corp., the commission also voted to explore creatinga county-owned facility to equip rail systems here andelsewhere. The car-making facility was proposed as a way tooffset lost aerospace-industry and other jobs in SouthernCalifornia.</LP><TEXT>   It further voted &quot;in principle&quot; to require that 60% offuture rail-car contract dollars be spent domestically as thecounty builds the $150 billion, 400-mile system, and said itmight consider raising the requirement for U.S. participationto 75%. Over 30 years, the Metro Line project is expected tobecome the nation's second-largest urban rail system.   &quot;You will see this all over the country in how governmentcontracts are awarded now. This will reverberate around thecountry,&quot; predicted Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs,an opponent of the Japanese award who said he had beendeluged with thousands of calls from like-mindedconstituents. &quot;This will keep jobs from going abroad,&quot; hesaid.   But Barna S. Szabo, a consultant for Sumitomo Corp. ofAmerica, said the move to require such hefty local spendingwill exclude any possible future foreign contracts. &quot;There isno way&quot; Sumitomo could bid on a contract that required 75% ofcontract dollars be spent in Los Angeles County, he said.&quot;This will ensure that there is a U.S. monopoly for thismarket.&quot;   It also could provide another chance for business forMorrison Knudsen Co. -- the only U.S. company that buildssuch rail cars, and loser to Sumitomo in the originalcontract for cars for the system's 20-mile-long Green Line.The Boise, Idaho, company's bid lost despite being $5 millionlower than Sumitomo's, because the 11-member countytransportation commission originally ruled that the Japanesecompany had superior managerial skills and other advantages.   Despite that prospect, however, Morrison Knudsen ChairmanWilliam Agee warned that Los Angeles County might make anexpensive mistake entering the rail-car-making business onits own. &quot;The Soviet Union just moved away from this kind ofownership,&quot; he said at the hearing. &quot;It just doesn't work.&quot;   Morrison Knudsen's rejected bid to build the Green Line's41 cars would have created 4,900 U.S. jobs, compared with the1,750 domestic jobs initially envisioned with the Japanesecompany's bid. However, after Sumitomo's contract came underattack, the Tokyo concern began talks with the transportationsystems unit of General Electric Co. for a possible role as asupplier of electric propulsion systems.   In Erie, Pa., a spokeswoman for the unit of Fairfield,Conn.-based GE said talks with Sumitomo were suspended whenthe company was told recently to suspend work on the program,but could resume if there were a need. The GE unit, thelargest U.S. maker of such propulsion systems, was part ofMorrison Knudsen's supplier team for its competing bid.   After the transportation commission's vote late yesterday,Sumitomo's U.S.-unit president, Kenji Miyahara, issued astatement saying the company was &quot;deeply disappointed,&quot; andwas considering how to respond. &quot;For the last two years, allconcerned parties knew the ground rules for awarding thecontract as well as the identities of the bidders.Nevertheless, our contract was canceled fornon-business-related reasons,&quot; the statement said.   Pressure on the commission to reverse the award has comefrom the region's rising unemployment -- especially in theaerospace business -- and from what was perceived as a poorshowing by President Bush in his trade talks in Japan.   &quot;We have really high unemployment rates,&quot; said BobLafarga, one of 50 members of Local 507 of the LaborersInternational Union at the hearing. &quot;We also have thehomeless. We are awarding contracts to other people ratherthan spending the money in our own backyard.&quot;   Waving signs with slogans such as &quot;American Jobs forAmericans,&quot; many in the audience applauded loudly aspoliticians prodded the council to revoke the Japanesecontract. &quot;We ought to use our tax dollars to create jobs inLos Angeles,&quot; said California Assemblyman Richard Katz,chairman of the assembly's Transportation Committee, whononetheless scoffed at the notion of the county itselfopening a rail-car manufacturing facility. Though elements ofJapan-bashing was at a minimum, one union member testifiedthat &quot;the Japanese have handed us another Pearl Harbor.&quot;   Were the county to build its own rail-car plant, it couldhelp jump-start a domestic rail-car business that currentlyaccounts for only about 4% of cars world-wide. Such a plant,which could also potentially produce transit-system buses,was estimated initially to cost $49 million, though somepoliticians suggested that might be an unrealistically lowfigure.</TEXT></DOC>
