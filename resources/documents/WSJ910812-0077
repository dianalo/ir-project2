For 50 years the &quot;P-Coast,&quot; as traders call it, has beentrading stocks a bit longer than the Big Board, in sessionsthat last until 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Then came a midsummershock: The Pacific's share of after-hours trading onexchanges plunged to 34% June 13, the day the Big Boardstarted its session for trading stocks after hours at the 4p.m. price.</LP><TEXT>   But now the Pacific exchange's market share is bouncingback, to an average 63% of after-hours trades in July. AndBig Board management is looking longingly at theauction-style market run by the Pacific exchange and talkingof its advantages over the Big Board's fixed-priceafter-hours sessions.   &quot;We watch {after-hours Pacific trading} all the time,&quot;says Lewis Horowitz, executive vice president at the BigBoard. &quot;We are not surprised that an extension of the auctionmarket would come out better than an electronically derivedconcept.&quot;   In July, the Pacific Stock Exchange traded an average328,127 shares in its after-hours session, about 1.7 timeswhat the Big Board traded in its own after-hours session forindividual stocks.   For Big Board officials, those shares trading on the WestCoast are a tempting target. The Big Board recently shelvedplans to open the exchange a half-hour earlier, at 9 a.m.Eastern time, after an embarrassing revolt by the membership.Even so, Big Board management believes the day will soon comewhen the largest foreign and U.S. stocks will trade outsideof normal hours at the exchange using the traditionalspecialist system.   Traders have long viewed the Pacific as a modest butimportant exchange when it comes to after-hours trading.During regular trading hours, the P-Coast exchange floors inLos Angeles and San Francisco do less than 5% of the dailyvolume handled by the Big Board. But after the closing bellat 4 p.m. Eastern time, it's a different story. How is thisregional exchange maintaining volume in the face of the newBig Board after-hours system and other electronic networks?   After the 4 p.m. New York close, stock prices on thePacific exchange keep changing with supply and demand. Bycontrast, on electronic networks such as Reuters HoldingsPLC's Crossing Network and the Big Board's Crossing Session I-- which lasts from 4:15 p.m. to 5 p.m Eastern time -- stockstrade at the 4 p.m. closing price, without the bartering thatoften gets the best price for investors.   &quot;When push comes to shove, investors will still go to theauction market because they know there's liquidity, it'shighly regulated, and there's an open-outcry auction settingprices,&quot; says Caroline B. Austin, president of Dempsey andamp; Co.,a specialist firm at the competing Midwest Stock Exchange.   &quot;When you must get something done after hours, you can goto the Pacific,&quot; says Mark Loehr, managing director at CSFirst Boston Inc.   Another competitor in the after-hours arena is Instinet,another Reuters system. Buyers and sellers can negotiateprices on Instinet's electronic billboard. During July,Instinet averaged 313,501 shares daily, slightly less thanthe P-Coast. Reuters keeps the unit open from 4 p.m. until9:30 a.m. the following day, or 17 hours longer than thePacific exchange. But there is no specialist -- a marketmaker with the responsibility to facilitate trades -- on theInstinet network.   Traders sometimes scoff, though, at the small sums ofmoney that regional specialists deploy to help out withtrades, compared with the well-financed specialist units atthe New York Stock Exchange. Pacific exchange traders say thereal problem is that they lack New York's abundance oforders. &quot;There isn't the paper here that's on the New Yorkorder book,&quot; says John T. Scully, a Pacific exchangespecialist.   Often, brokers will use the Pacific exchange to &quot;cross&quot;stock, which occurs when a buyer and seller swap stock on anagreed-upon price. Electronic networks provide the samefunction with greater anonymity, but not always the speed.   &quot;The Pacific exchange allows brokers and clients to crosswithout waiting to get reports. It is a nice accommodation,&quot;says Chris McLellan, head of equity trading at Robertson,Stephens andamp; Co., a West Coast broker. At the Big Board,meanwhile, the results of the after-hours session arereleased between 5:20 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time.   In many cases, the specialists at the P-Coast are makingmarkets. On Thursday, for example, 20 minutes after the closeof trading in New York, Michael Harper, a specialist on thePacific's Los Angeles floor, was setting the price forWestinghouse shares. He bought 100 shares from ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. at around 4:20 p.m. Eastern time, andsold 1,300 shares to Pershing, a division of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. a few minutes later,changing the stock's ticker price to 24 1/8, then back up to24 1/4.   &quot;Both those trades were done with my own capital in my ownmarket,&quot; says Mr. Harper.   Currently, the Pacific Stock Exchange is awaiting approvalfrom the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand itsafter-hours session to 4:50 p.m. Eastern time. &quot;West Coastinvestors don't go home just because the New York StockExchange is closed for the day,&quot; says Dale Carlson, aspokesman for the exchange. &quot;There are still brokers who arecalling clients after 1 p.m. {4 p.m. Eastern time}, and ifour markets are liquid their customers can get their ordersfilled here.&quot;   Of course, the Big Board will continue to watch thesuccess of the Pacific's expanded auction market closely.Right now, some brokers say, there's not enough demand tokeep the New York trading floor open until 5 p.m. Easterntime; but the Pacific exchange may prove that assumptionwrong.   &quot;The New York Stock Exchange is trying to respond to avery specific need with these `black box' trading systems,&quot;says Mr. Loehr of CS First Boston. &quot;There is a different needwhich the P-Coast fills -- and the {Big Board} has to addressthat at some point&quot; with their extended hours.</TEXT></DOC>
