Salomon said the settlement won't lead to a charge againstearnings. The parent of Salomon Brothers Inc. disputed manyof the department's claims but said it agreed to settle toavoid years of litigation.</LP><TEXT>   The settlement is the latest from a string of claims madeby the Energy Department. For several years, the departmenthas been investigating the transactions of thousands ofcompanies suspected of violating the government's crude-oilprice controls, which were in effect during the sharp rise inoil prices in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo.   The Reagan administration terminated the controls in 1981.   In September 1988, the Energy Department startedadministrative proceedings against Salomon, seeking paymentof as much as $108 million, plus interest. But Salomon saidthe department's recent administrative proceedings &quot;havereduced significantly the company's maximum potentialexposure&quot; under the government's allegations.   The planned settlement would be one of the few jolts forSalomon so far this year; both its securities business andits Phibro Energy oil unit have been thriving, particularlyin the wake of the recent Iraqi attack against Kuwait and theresulting wild swings in oil and stock prices.   The settlement caps a four-year battle between Salomon andthe Energy Department. In 1987, a federal judge orderedSalomon to turn over to the department virtually all itsdocuments relating to the company's purchases and sales ofcrude oil from 1973 to 1980.   The judge's order came despite complaints by Salomon aboutthe &quot;voluminous&quot; amount of data the department was seeking --specified in 103 pages of subpoenas. The Energy Departmentwas looking into whether Salomon resold crude oil at anappropriate price under the government's regulations whenthey were in effect.   In 1987, Salomon separately settled with the EnergyDepartment concerning crude-oil sales from 1973 to 1977 bypaying about $16.3 million, including interest.</TEXT></DOC>
