After yesterday's board meeting, Britoil's chief executive officer, David Walker, said the sweetened offer is &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;still significantly undervalues&quot; Britoil. A Britoil spokesman said the North Sea oil producer is continuing to talk to several potential rescuers, which he declined to identify.    Analysts and traders yesterday cited British Gas PLC, Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Exxon Corp. as possible white knights. All three companies declined comment.    Many observers are increasingly doubtful that Britoil will find a suitor. Britoil is becoming expensive. BP's sweetened offer values the company at #2.5 billion ($4.42 billion), 2 1/2 times its recent value. Britoil has alluring assets -- including about 7% of North Sea oil production. But analysts question whether anyone is willing to pay more than BP. Atlantic Richfield Co., which had been seeking just under 50% of Britoil as a way of blocking BP, now intends to accept BP's sweetened offer.    On London's stock exchange, Britoil shares traded late yesterday at 479 pence ($8.50) each, below BP's sweetened bid of 500 pence a share and reflecting investors' skepticism about the possibility of a higher bid.    Any additional bidder would face the prospect of a protracted auction against BP, which seems determined to buy Britoil. Even if it won such a contest, a bidder might find that BP would keep its current 29.9% Britoil stake -- a distracting and potentially annnoying minority holding.    It also remains unclear how the British government intends to use its golden share, which could block a change in control of Britoil. The government often keeps a golden share when it sells state-owned companies to ensure their future independence. In Britoil's case, that strategy doesn't seem to be working.    But the golden share still gives the government power to block major corporate changes. In Parliament yesterday, Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson repeated that the government intends to use the golden share to do that. BP is betting that the golden share won't amount to much.    Analysts doubt other bidders would be so bold. The chances of Britoil escaping BP &quot;seem remote,&quot; says Jeremy Elden, an oil analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew. &quot;It would be very expensive for someone to come in and top&quot; BP, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
