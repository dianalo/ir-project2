Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc. offered to end their hostile bid to acquire Burlington Industries Inc. in exchange for payment of more than $25 million and the right to buy certain Burlington businesses, according to sources familiar with the proposal.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the New York investor and Montreal-based Dominion disclosed that between last Friday and last Tuesday, they held discussions with representatives of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. about &quot;the possibility of settlement of outstanding matters among&quot; the Edelman-Dominion partnership, Morgan Stanley and Burlington. Mr. Edelman and Dominion said they &quot;did not reach any understanding or agreement as a result of&quot; the talks.    As reported, Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington last week agreed to be acquired by a group led by Morgan Stanley in a leveraged buyout for $76 a share, or $2.09 billion.    The partners didn't elaborate on the settlement talks in the filing, which was made in connection with their sweetened tender offer of $77 a share, or $1.84 billion, to acquire the 86.4% of Burlington they don't already own. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Edelman declined to comment on the content of settlement discussions. In Montreal, a Dominion spokesman also wouldn't comment on the talks.    In the SEC filing yesterday, the partners also disclosed their plans for financing their latest offer. They said that they would need about $2.4 billion to complete the bid and pay related expenses.    Wall Street sources familiar with the settlement talks said they began when Mr. Edelman called a representative of Morgan Stanley after Burlington announced it had reached an agreement to be bought by the New York investment banking firm.    In that phone conversation and others after it, the sources said, Mr. Edelman assured Morgan Stanley he would drop his and Dominion's bid for Burlington in return for the payment of legal, printing and other expenses. The sources said that Mr. Edelman also asked Morgan Stanley to reimburse him and Dominion for costs associated with carrying the partners' 13.4% Burlington stake.    A Dominion representative later called Morgan Stanley, saying that the textile maker was also interested in settling, sources familiar with the settlement talks said. Besides the payment of expenses, Dominion also asked for the right to buy Burlington's denim-making operations and certain other company properties, the sources said.    When asked to comment on details of the settlement talks, the Dominion spokesman said, &quot;The fact that we are interested in the denim and other entities of Burlington is well known.&quot; Morgan Stanley officials declined to comment on the discussions.    Mr. Edelman and Dominion have insisted that they are eager to buy Burlington. However, if they were to drop their $77-a-share offer and sell their Burlington stock to the Morgan Stanley group, the partners would stand to reap a profit of $90 million.    Meanwhile, Mr. Edelman and Dominion said in their SEC filing that First National Bank of Chicago and Royal Bank of Canada have agreed to form a syndicate of banks to provide $1.5 billion of financing for their sweetened offer. The partners said they had paid the two banks $2.25 million each in fees.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which is managing the Edelman-Dominion offer, has agreed to provide a $1.5 billion bridge loan to help finance the partners' latest bid. That loan would be refinanced if the offer is completed. Shearson had previously offered to provide a bridge loan of as much as $1.05 billion.    The partners agreed to increase the amount of equity they would contribute in a Burlington buyout to $352 million from $200 million.    Separately, in a letter yesterday to Frank S. Greenberg, Burlington chairman, Mr. Edelman and Dominion said they regarded Burlington's agreement to pay Morgan Stanley $25 million in &quot;breakup&quot; fees if the leveraged buyout isn't completed &quot;as contrary to law, unless similar arrangements are made with us or any bona fide higher bidder.&quot;    &quot;We insist that you nullify that agreement immediately,&quot; the partners added in the letter. </TEXT></DOC>
