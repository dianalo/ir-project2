(William F. Zachmann) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Zachmann, William F.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The computer industry is working to develop software systems thatare easier to use than those of the past, but so-called 'ease ofuse' is often more of a marketing tool than a reality.andP;  Artificialintelligence and natural language interfaces were highly touted inthe mid-1980s but have fallen out of favor; current ease-of-use'solutions' include multimedia, pen-based systems and graphicaluser interfaces.andP;  Well designed graphical interfaces aredesirable, but the 'religion' which claims an easy-to-use computerwill bring computers into every home is false.andP;  Microsoft Windows3.0 is not as easy to use as the Mac and is more complex than DOSin many respects.andP;  Software is not becoming easier to use; thetrue definition of technological advance is the empowerment ofusers to do more complex and useful things with their machines.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     User InterfaceUser-FriendlinessMicrocomputersComputer industryTrendsFuture of Computing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Industry experts await the day when more powerful systems run software thatis significantly easier to use.andP;  They have a very long wait, indeed.andM;Put together a panel of personal computer industry executives.andP;  Ask them totalk about the future of software.andP;  You are almost certain to hear them say:&quot;Our challenge in the years ahead will be to make computers and softwareeasier to use.&quot;andM;It borders on becoming some sort of standard ritual incantation.andP;  The litanygoes on from there.andP;  It tells of how computers are still used by only aportion of the population.andP;  It tells (particularly if vendors, resellers, orthe financial community are a significant element in the congregation) of apromised land of renewed industry growth once the &quot;ease-of-use&quot; problem issolved.andM;From that point onward, matters are a bit murkier.andP;  Depending upon who ispreaching (and what his or her company's products are) the description of thepath to the promised land of &quot;ease of use&quot; may vary.andP;  Certainly, thatdescription will be characterized by vague generality rather than crispspecificity.andP;  It will often be accompanied by statements like: &quot;We need touse the increasing power and complexity of systems to simplify the userinterface and make computing power accessible to unsophisticated users.&quot; Andso forth.andM;Just how &quot;we&quot; are going to achieve these lofty goals varies widely.andP;  Currentcandidate vehicles of salvation include graphical user interfaces,multimedia, pen-based systems, programming for nonprogrammers,object-oriented something-or-others, voice recognition, and a host of others.andM;That is simply the contemporary set, however.andP;  A few years ago, the listwould have prominently featured natural language recognition and artificialintelligence.andP;  These two, having lost an awful lot of money for venturecapital and other investors, are currently out of favor.andM;Which makes the point that while the proposed means of salvation havechanged, the basic litany has been with us for a while.andP;  The gospel ofimproved &quot;ease of use&quot; expanding the market to &quot;people who don't usecomputers (yet)&quot; and creating &quot;renewed growth in the industry&quot; dates back atleast to the mini-slump that was experienced by the personal computerindustry at the end of 1984.andM;So perhaps it is time to pose the critical question: Is this a true religion?andO;Or, rather, is this religion true? Is improved ease of use really attainableand will it create a new spurt of double digit industry growth as previousnonusers become computer users?andM;The answers are no, no, no, and no.andP;  Let's consider why.andM;Immediately, one should be suspicious of both the divergent directions inwhich the path to salvation is said to lie, and the high degree of generalityin the description of said path, whatever its claimed direction.andP;  Closeexamination of the proposed paths reveals significant limitations.andM;THE EASY-TO-USE INTERFACEandM;Consider, for example, the way of the GUI.andP;  The graphical user interface hasbeen heralded by many as the primary road to industry salvation by &quot;ease ofuse.&quot; The facts, however, suggest otherwise.andM;It is not my intention to suggest that a well-designed GUI is not desirable,nor that it is incapable of making computers easier to use.andP;  The AppleMacintosh has unquestionably provided access to computers for many people whowere not (or would not have been) comfortable with a DOS &quot;C:andgt;&quot; prompt.andP;  If,however, Apple's computer were really capable of delivering computing powerinto the hands of the multitudes, the multitudes would already have boughtthem, the promised land of a computer in every pot (well, in the hands ofevery human who might conceivably use one, anyway) would already have beenreached, and the pool of  people who don't use computers &quot;(yet)&quot; would havelong since evaporated.andM;&quot;Aha,&quot; some might say, &quot;but the Macintosh has always been a proprietarysystem and a tad pricey.andP;  What was really needed was a GUI supported by manyvendors.&quot; That argument isn't terribly persuasive, since it isn't obvious why&quot;the rest of them&quot; should have failed to buy the Mac simply because it wasproprietary and (until recently) cost more.andM;Nor does the recent success of Windows 3.0 prove otherwise.andP;  While Windowsundoubtedly brings many of the benefits of the Apple Macintosh to users ofIBM and compatible systems, ease of use is not really one of them.andP;  TheMacintosh still remains much easier to use than Windows 3.0.andM;In fact, Windows not only falls short of the Macintosh with regard to ease ofuse, but in many respects Windows is far more difficult to use than plain oldDOS.andP;  True, once set up and running smoothly, Windows offers at least some ofthe ease-of-use features of the Macintosh.andP;  But getting Windows set up andrunning smoothly can in fact be a daunting experience for many users; onethat makes DOS seem trivially easy, by contrast.andM;For those unlucky enough to have plumbed the mysteries of the WIN.INI orSYS.INI files in order to get Windows 3.0 running on their system, for thoseinto whose lives the demon &quot;unrecoverable application errors&quot; must fall, forthose whose CONFIG.SYS file did things that angered the gods of Wynne Three,(and for the corporate personal computer support people who've had to bailout all of the above) Windows has been anything but easy to use.andM;That is not an exception but the rule.andP;  In reality, software is not gettingeasier but typically more difficult to use.andP;  The esoteric complexities ofWindows 3.0 are echoed in other software domains, as well.andP;  The latest andgreatest word processing and spreadsheet programs, for example, jam-packedwith advanced features and capabilities, are normally more difficult tomaster than their predecessors.andM;Migration to the GUI environment and the rich array of fonts and styles thatnaturally follow increases any user's choices and makes programs moredifficult to learn and use.andP;  The ability to create &quot;hot links&quot; betweenapplications via DDE or other means, to access remote data via networks, andsimilar capabilities compound the complexity even further.andP;  All this,however, may appear simple by comparison to what we'll face once multimediareally takes off !andP;  No, despite the pious incantations routinely uttered onindustry panels, software isn't going to get fundamentally simpler andcomputers aren't going to get fundamentally easier to use.andP;  That is thereality.andP;  Each advance in ease of use will be matched by increased complexityin what we do with computers.andM;That's not necessarily a bad thing; it's likely an essential characteristicof an advancing technology.andP;  We shall be able to do more, more-complex, andultimately more-useful things with computers.andP;  Therein may lie our salvation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
