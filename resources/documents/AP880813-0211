The Dammam aquifer, running like an umbilical cord under the sixnations, provides an estimated one-third of their overall water.But with all six states sucking up the water faster than nature canput it back, the experts predict a future far more arid than it isnow.   ``Man can live without food for two to three months, but hewould die without water for two to three days,'' said Ahmed AdelOrabi, deputy director of the regional U.N. Environmental Program,which is based in Bahrain, a Gulf island.   ``If extraction continues to exceed recharge, the Dammam aquifercan dry up within 10 to 50 years,'' he said. ``If well-exploited,it can last forever.''   Water resources are a problem throughout the Middle East: riotsbroke out in Sudan in July over fluctuations in the water supply;Libya is expecting to invest $25 billion in an underground riversystem; some analysts see a danger of wars in the future over thearea's water resources.   The Dammam aquifer stretches the length of the western coastlineof the Persian Gulf, from Kuwait in the north through Saudi Arabia,Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.   The reservoir, used mostly for agriculture, is the source of theartesian wells that allowed oases to flourish along the coast forhundreds of years.   But oil wealth brought new demands on the water supply aseconomies expanded.   Saudi Arabia has a daily desalinized water flow of 588 milliongallons for a population of less than 12 million. With its vast oilreserves, it can afford it.   But states like Bahrain still have to rely on nature, andofficials here view the depletion of the Dammam aquifer with alarm.Bahrain gets 50 percent of its water from the underground system.   ``Water has been stored in the reservoir over millions of years.... Over the past 10 to 15 years, it is being bled more than can becompensated,'' said Jamil Al Alawi, Bahrain's assistantundersecretary for power and water affairs.   Bahrain's finances, battered by soft oil prices, have enabled itto build only two desalinization plants. A third, a gift from SaudiArabia, has been delayed.   Desalinization plants make it unlikely that anyone in the areawill go thirsty. But the cost of the refined water is prohibitivefor farm irrigation. This means that water from the aquifer couldbe the key to agricultural and economic development.   ``Desalinization plants complement the reservoir, they are goodfor drinking purposes, but it is the reservoir that helps vitaldevelopment going,'' said Orabi. ``There can be no food securitywithout water security.''   Area leaders call for nationwide prayers when the rains do notcome in the winter, while newspaper and television campaigns skewercareless users.   Television programs remind Bahrainis that only 50 years agowater used to be hauled in from the ``kawkabs'' _ the sweet-watersprings gushing from the sea.   ``Water is our most precious source of life. When it's gone, soare we,'' said another TV program.   This year's rains have been bountiful, so much so that tomatogrowers on Bahrain nearly lost their crops.   But rains are unpredictable.   The U.N. Environmental Program hopes to come up with acomprehensive plan within two years for conserving the Dammanaquifer, and an international agreement might have to be worked outto distribute the water among the six nations.   The U.N. plan will also suggest alternative irrigation sources,such as recycling sewer water. It also will seek to re-educatefarmers on cutting the amount of water used on their fields.   Orabi said it is a false concept that land in desert areasrequires more water for irrigation.   Al-Alawi estimated that Bahrain's population was growing at therate of 5 percent to 10 percent annually, and coupled with a risingstandard of living, water consumption reached a peak of 61 milliongallons a day last year. It is expected to hit 65 million thissummer. Its desalinization plants produce a little over half that.   Until greater production and conservation redress the situation,Bahrain would have to pump 30 million gallons a day from the Dammamaquifer to meet demand.   Bahrain sits at the edge of the aquifer, and drawing too muchwater too fast could allow seawater to seep in, Al-Alawi said. Toomuch salinity in artesian wells is irreversible.   ``This year and the coming years the situation is critical,(but) I won't call it dangerous,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri AMs Aug. 19</NOTE></DOC>
