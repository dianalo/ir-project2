(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Hollywood photographer who spentdecades shooting pictures of glamorous stars says his favoritesubject was a shy, adventurous pilot he thought of as a sister.   When Albert Bresnik signed on as Amelia Earhart's personalphotographer in 1932, he was accustomed to subjects with more flashand charisma than the aviation pioneer. Eventually, he learnedEarhart's inner beauty outshined the luster of his Hollywoodsubjects.   ``She was a fantastic woman who didn't have what we callcharisma. She had an inner loveliness, a gallant nature. She wantedto prove that women should be as good as men in flight,'' Bresnik,74, said during an interview Wednesday.   ``I have photographed the biggest stars, actresses that had alot of beauty and talent. But Amelia has shone up above them all.''   As part of the today's 60th anniversary of Earhart's firsttrans-Atlantic flight, Bresnik is displaying rarely seenphotographs of the aviator in this northern California city nearSan Jose. The photographs were taken during the five years beforeEarhart disappeared in the South Pacific.   On June 18, 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly acrossthe Atlantic as a navigator. She set out a day earlier, flying withpilot Wilmer Stultz, and an airplane mechanic, Lou Gordon, fromTrepassey, Newfoundland, to Burry Port, Wales.   Although Earhart later made a solo flight across the Atlantic,the 1928 flight is hailed as a major aviation victory for women andwas celebrated with a ticker tape parade in New York City.   Earhart met Bresnik four years later and hired him to accompanyher to public events and help her prepare a book. Her husband,publisher George Putnam, approached Bresnik in 1932, while Bresnikwas a photographer for CBS.   ``She liked me very much, right off the bat. She called me herlittle brother. We just joked and got along very well. She didn'twant anyone else to shoot her picture,'' said Bresnik, who lives inthe Los Angeles area.   Several months before her mysterious disappearance they beganshooting photographs for a book Earhart wanted to call ``WorldFlight.'' Originally, Bresnik was to accompany Earhart and hernavigator Fred Noonan and her radio control operator Harry Manningon their last flight.   However, Bresnik was replaced by Earhart's flight technicianPaul Mantz.   ``I was supposed to go only because I would take pictures whenshe would stop and meet the heads of state. During the last 2,500miles, I was to wait for her in Oakland and photograph herarrival.''   The crew of four flew to Hawaii, but they returned to Oaklandafter the plane had mechanical problems. Earhart and Noonan thenrecommenced their historic flight attempt, heading east withoutMantz and Manning.   ``The preparations changed daily. She finally said to me, `Well,I'm leaving,' and I said, `I had a ticket to go and somewhere alongthe way I lost the ticket.' And she said, `Well, that's the way thewind blows.'''   ``I said, `God bless you. Have a nice trip and I'll see you whenyou get back.'''   Several years after the disappearance, the book was published as``Last Flight.'' It features many of Bresnik's photographs ofEarhart and her Model 10E Electra ``Flying Laboratory,'' theaircraft she was flying when she disappeared.   Most of Bresnik's Earhart photos were stored away after herdisappearance. He didn't bring them out until last year, the 50thanniversary of Earhart's last flight.   Many of the details surrounding Earhart's disappearance areunknown. It is known that she completed about 22,000 miles of theflight, and it is believed she went down within 100 miles of theHowland Islands in the South Pacific.   Over the years, there have been claims that Earhart is alive andliving on an island in the South Pacific or that she and Manningwere actually spies who were kidnapped by the Japanese.   While Bresnik dismisses most of these claims, but he does haveone bizarre story of his own.   The day before Earhart was reported missing, a man walked intoBresnik's Hollywood shop and identified himself as a doctor,Bresnik said. He stared at one of Bresnik's photographs of Earhartand said, ``The lightforce in the picture is gone, she's crashedand drowned.'' Bresnik said.   ``In Hollywood, we had people that were sort of crazy. But Icalled George, her husband, and said, `George, what's happened (toAmelia)?' And he said, `She's fine, I talked to her yesterday.'''   Several hours later, Bresnik heard that Earhart's plane was lost.</TEXT></DOC>
