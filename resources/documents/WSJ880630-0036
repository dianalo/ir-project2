Bass Group's request for a preliminary injunction against Macmillan Inc.'s proposed restructuring plan. Earlier this month, the court had granted the Bass Group's request for a temporary restraining order. Macmillan, a New York publishing and information concern, proposed a massive restructuring in response to the Bass Group's $1.9 billion bid to acquire Macmillan last month.    Delaware Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs said he would &quot;be getting back to counsel&quot; as soon as he could. </TEXT></DOC>
