Officials said they are investigating the matter after receiving requests for information from the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, the Paris-based group that monitors sales of sensitive technology to communist countries.    Ratier-Forest was split into two companies in 1982, one called Forest Line and the other Ratier Figeac. Toshiba Corp., in a report issued Wednesday on the illegal sale of sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union by its own machine-tool unit, charged that a French company called Forest Line illegally sold milling machines to the Soviets in the mid-1970s and that Toshiba Machine Co. workers saw a Forest Line machine in a Leningrad factory in 1983 and 1984.    U.S. diplomats in Washington had said earlier this week that the French were investigating Forest Line.    Officials at Forest Line and Ratier Figeac were unavailable for comment yesterday. But on Wednesday, Forest Line's chairman, Louis Paul Demesse, said his company didn't know anything about any such sales.    Meanwhile, two senior officials of Toshiba Machine admitted in court that they were aware that the sales by their company of milling machines to the Soviets were illegal.    The statement came in Tokyo District Court at the opening of the trial of Ryuzo Hayashi, 53 years old, chief of Toshiba Machine's materials-storage division, and Hiroaki Tanimura, 50, vice director of the company's machine-technology division.    The two managers, who were put on leave after the milling-machine sales were revealed, are charged with violating Japan's foreign-exchange and export-control law by selling the Soviets software in 1984 for use with the machines.    The milling machines sold to the Soviets were used to produce ultraquiet submarine propellers, reducing the effectiveness of U.S. listening devices. U.S. officials have said the exports seriously undermined Western security efforts.    Messrs. Hayashi and Tanimura, who could be sentenced to as many as three years in jail, have admitted that they helped Toshiba Machine sell the milling equipment to the Soviets for $28.2 million in 1983 and 1984.    Under Japanese law, the trial continues despite the admissions. The prosecutor will tell the court what penalty he is seeking at a later hearing, which has not yet been set. </TEXT></DOC>
