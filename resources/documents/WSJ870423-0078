Although Dart two weeks ago withdrew an unsolicited proposal to acquire Supermarkets General for more than $1.73 billion, the threat of a renewed takeover bid has continued to hang over the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer.    Under the buyout accord, an investor group led by a Merrill Lynch unit -- Merrill Lynch Capital Partners -- and members of Supermarkets General management will begin a tender offer Monday of $46.75 a share, or $1.5 billion, for 85% of Supermarkets General common stock outstanding. Holders of remaining Supermarkets General shares will receive a package of debt securities and preferred stock. Traders and investment bankers valued the entire proposal at $46.50 a share. The definitive buyout agreement was unanimously approved by Supermarkets General's board.    Supermarkets General is the nation's eighth-largest food retailer and the parent of Pathmark supermarkets and Rickel home-improvement stores.    The news sent Supermarkets General stock up $4.75 yesterday to $45.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With volume of 4.3 million shares, the stock was the most actively traded Big Board issue.    Some takeover speculators predicted that Dart, controlled by the Haft family, would either try to top the Merrill Lynch offer or force up the price. The Landover, Md.-based discount retailer currently holds slightly less than 5% of Supermarkets General's 38.5 million common shares outstanding.    Robert Haft, Dart president, said he was waiting for details of the offer and intended to request from the Supermarkets General board the &quot;same confidential inside information and access given to Merrill Lynch and denied to us.&quot; Dart has previously said it was denied a &quot;selling brochure&quot; because it wouldn't agree to sign a three-year standstill agreement not to purchase the company. Dart said it subsequently got a &quot;bare-bones outline&quot; from Supermarkets General. However, because Dart again refused to sign the agreement, Mr. Haft said it didn't get access to the confidential information or to management.    &quot;We have made two offers merely on public information and now Merrill Lynch and management made their offer based on inside information and full knowlege of our plans.&quot; Mr. Haft said. He added: &quot;It's like playing in a card game with a marked deck. Merrill Lynch and management knew our cards, but we didn't know theirs.&quot;    Mr. Haft said Dart was studying all its options, including a bid for the company, a tender offer, opposing the Merrill Lynch offer by a lawsuit or proxy fight and either holding or selling Dart's stake.    Mr. Haft declined to predict what Dart would do. &quot;We'll make our decision when we get the details of the offer and the inside information,&quot; he said.    Wall Street sources said that the tender offer will be financed with a Merrill Lynch bridge loan of $700 million to $800 million, and $1 billion borrowed from a group of banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Bankers Trust Co.    The use of bridge loans, in which investment banking firms temporarily commit their own money to help complete acquisitions, has become a fixture on Wall Street. Merrill Lynch recently agreed to make a $650 million bridge loan to finance a tender offer for Borg-Warner Corp. by a Merrill-led group. In both cases, Merrill expects to get its money back through a sale of high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds.    &quot;One of the reasons we felt comfortable with the Merrill proposal was a high level of confidence that the transactions would close, given the financing commitments in place,&quot; said J. Tomlinson Hill, a managing director and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which advised Supermarkets General.    Dart Group never made a formal tender offer for Supermarkets General, although it insisted it had adequate financing for a bid. Dart said it withdrew its offer because Supermarkets General hadn't responded to its proposals.    Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, a leveraged buyout unit of the big securities firm, is funded by Merrill Lynch and institutional investors.    Wall Street sources said Merrill Lynch Capital Partners and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. will make an equity investment totaling $100 million as part of the buyout. Certain Supermarkets General managers would pay about $10 million for a 10% stake in the new, closely held company. The sources said the total value of the buyout, including the assumption of existing debt, is more than $2.1 billion.    The Merrill Lynch group's cash offer will be for as many as 32.8 million Supermarkets General shares. The planned offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of a minimum 51% of the company's shares, the redemption of anti-takeover &quot;poison pill&quot; rights and definitive financing agreements.    The offer will be followed by a merger of Supermarkets General and a new company. In the merger, Supermarkets holders would receive for each of their remaining shares a package consisting of $27.534 face amount of 13 1/8% subordinated debentures and 0.709 share of $3.52 cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of $25. Investment bankers valued the package at about $45.26 for each Supermarkets share.    Dart's sweetened $1.73 billion offer, which it withdrew, proposed to pay Supermarkets General holders $42 a share in cash, $3 a share in preferred stock and an undetermined amount of common stock in the surviving company.    Supermarkets General said that when the merger is completed, Kenneth Peskin, 47 years old, currently Pathmark division president, will become chairman and chief executive officer of the new company.    Leonard Lieberman, Supermarkets General's 58-year-old chairman and chief executive, won't participate in the company. In an interview yesterday, he said, &quot;Given my own age . . . I could not responsibly make the kind of commitment that would have been required for me to be a part of the company going forward.&quot;    James D. Dougherty, 50, currently executive vice president, will become president, and Jack Futterman, 53, currently president of the drugstore merchandising division, will be vice chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
