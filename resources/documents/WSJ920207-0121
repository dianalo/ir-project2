Oil output could come on line possibly as early as thenext several weeks from the so-called neutral zone whereTexaco operates. Company officials said it was too early totell how much would initially be produced.

And Japan'sArabian Oil Co. has been producing oil from the offshoreportion of the neutral zone for weeks. Wells in the al-Wafrafield had been damaged by fire during the invasion, but thefield didn't sustain anywhere the amount of damage asKuwait's oil fields further north.   Texaco is expected to export the heavy crude produced fromthe al-Wafra field. Before the invasion, it was refining itscrude in a refinery near al-Wafra.
