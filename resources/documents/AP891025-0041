A statement from Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, wasdelivered Tuesday to the independent newspaper An-Nahar and aWestern news agency in Beirut.   The agency's copy was accompanied by an instant photograph ofAmerican hostage Terry Anderson, who has been held the longest ofthe 18 Western hostages. Anderson, abducted March 16, 1985, ischief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.   ``We renew our firm emphasis on the need to free our strugglingbrethren from the jails of the collaborating Kuwaiti regime, anddeclare that the Mujahedeen (holy warriors) shall not rest untilthey see their brethren free,'' said the statement, typewritten inArabic.   The photograph of Anderson was similar to one released byIslamic Jihad on Nov. 4, 1988, with the last statement from thegroup, showing Anderson about to cut a birthday cake.   No cake was visible in the latest picture, a close-up from aslightly different angle that shows Anderson from the waist up,mustachioed and smiling, wearing glasses and a yellow T-shirt. Inthe background is what appears to be the same blue curtain.   Anderson turns 42 on Friday. It will be his fifth birthday incaptivity.   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins,Colo., who was acting dean of agriculture at American University ofBeirut when he was abducted June 9, 1985.   The Shiite Moslems in Kuwait were convicted on terrorist chargesstemming from the 1983 embassy bombings, in which at least fivepeople were killed and 86 wounded. Three have been condemned todeath, but the sentences have not been carried out. Kuwait hasrefused previous demands to release the prisoners.   With the statement delivered to An-Nahar were two pictures ofthe U.S. Marine base and the French paratroop headquarters inBeirut that were attacked with truck bombs Oct. 23, 1983.   Islamic Jihad said it issued the statement to mark theanniversary of the bombings, which killed 241 American militarypersonnel and 58 French soldiers.   Like most other Lebanese factions claiming to hold Westernhostages in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad is believed to be a group ofShiite zealots loyal to Iran.   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran offered Monday to helpsecure the hostages' release if the United States releases frozenIranian assets or helps determine the fate of three Iranians, nowbelieved dead, kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
