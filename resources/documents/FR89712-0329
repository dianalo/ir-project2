The proposed revision would revise the TechnicalSpecifications Section 3/4.6.5.3 by creating separate Sections 3/4.6.5.3.1,and 3/4.6.5.3.2; rewording certain surveillance requirements and addinga footnote to those Sections; and, for Section 3/4.7.2, rewording surveillancerequirement 4.7.2.c and adding a footnote to that Section. The separationof the Filtration, Recirculation, and Ventilation System into two subsystemswith identical limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirementsprovides the intended clarification and does not remove or relax the currentrequirements. The requested change of the acceptance criterion to 7.5%methyl iodine penetration for tests of the FRVS-RS charcoal while the acceptancecriterion for the test of the FRVS-VS charcoal remains at 1.0% penetrationcorresponds to a combined iodide penetration for the two beds in seriesof less than 0.075%, which is within the Regulatory Guide 1.52 criterion.The requested change would require subsystem flow rate, in-place penetration,or carbon absorbent laboratory tests only upon determination that the HighEfficiency Particulate Activity (HEPA) filters or carbon absorbent couldhave been damaged by structural maintenance or adversely affected by chemicals,fumes or foreign materials. The amendment would further clarify that thisdetermination shall consider the maintenance performed and/or the type,quantity, length of contact time, known effects and previous accumulationhistory for all contaminants which could reduce the system performanceto less than that verified by the acceptance criteria of the tests.The proposed amendment described above does not change operation of thefacility and the change in the surveillance acceptance criterion is consistentwith the intent of Regulatory Guide 1.52. Therefore, the proposed changesdo not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changesare being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmentalimpact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20 and changes to the surveillance requirements. It doesnot affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnon-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Environmental Report-Operating License Stage for the Hope CreekGenerating Station, dated August, 1983.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff consulted with the State of New Jersey. The comments receivedfrom the Bureau of Nuclear Engineering of the State of New Jersey willbe addressed in the Safety Evaluation issued with the amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated November 25, 1987 and a supplement dated April 17, 1989which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Pennsville PublicLibrary, 190 S.
