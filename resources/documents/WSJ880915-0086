Flanked by his party's leading congressional authorities on national security, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D. Ga.), the Democratic presidential nominee pledged to go forward with some important strategic systems -- including the Stealth bomber, D-5 submarine-based missile and an advanced cruise missile. And he said he would place greater emphasis than the Reagan administration on improving conventional military capabilities, such as tanks, helicopters and anti-tank weapons for central Europe.    In what was billed as a major national security address at Georgetown University, the Massachusetts governor promised fidelity to the goals of Democratic Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, and he stressed that he would fashion a defense policy partnership with Congress. He was joined by Sen. Nunn, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) and respected senior House Democrat Lee Hamilton of Indiana, who has emerged as his top foreign policy adviser.    Gov. Dukakis also leveled his sharpest attack yet on the Reagan-Bush defense program, arguing that the administration's massive military buildup has been largely &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; because it hasn't increased U.S. military strength as much as the White House claims. He pointed to problems plaguing the $27 billion B-1 bomber, shortages in military nurses and doctors, and chaos and corruption in the defense procurement process. He also blasted the president's recent veto of the defense authorization bill as playing &quot;politics&quot; with national defense.    In his speech, Mr. Dukakis didn't change his position on any specific weapons systems, but he struck a tougher tone. Still, he reiterated that he would scuttle two planned nuclear weapons: the rail-launched MX missile and the $45 billion Midgetman missile, both of which Mr. Bush supports. Mr. Dukakis also said again that he would scale back the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative -- the&quot;Star Wars&quot; defense -- which he called &quot;a fantastically complicated scheme whose purpose seems to change every few months, and whose feasibility has been questioned by virtually the entire scientific community.&quot;    Mr. Bush, who hasn't called for cutting any weapons, has portrayed his Democratic opponent as naive on defense matters and inclined to weaken the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Polls indicate that a solid majority of voters prefer the vice president on defense and foreign policy matters.    In particular, the Bush campaign has argued that Mr. Dukakis would weaken the U.S. nuclear triad -- which includes air-based, land-based and sea-based weapons -- by killing both the rail-based MX and the Midgetman. Mr. Dukakis has said he'd consider some other land-based missile that isn't as costly as the Midgetman or as vulnerable to enemy attack as the MX. But he hasn't provided any specifics, and Republicans contend there aren't any feasible alternatives.    Yesterday, Mr. Dukakis tried to turn the tables by slamming the Reagan-Bush administration for failing to end waste and fraud in weapons-buying. &quot;We're going to clean up the mess in the Pentagon,&quot; the Democratic nominee declared. He said he would push for more competition among contractors and insist that arms-makers provide warranties on new weapons. He didn't propose any detailed plans for overhauling the complicated procurement system, though.    Stressing the need to beef up conventional defenses, Mr. Dukakis charged that the Reagan administration allowed the Soviet Union to increase its advantage over the U.S. and its allies in tanks and armored vehicles. He pledged that a Dukakis administration would build more U.S. tanks and step up research into new antitank weapons. He also said he would keep up production of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, as well as proceed with the Pentagon's new advanced tactical fighter.    Mr. Dukakis also warned of Soviet gains in submarine warfare, and he promised to deploy the Navy's new SSN-21 Seawolf submarine.    Part of Mr. Dukakis' plan to improve conventional forces is making troops and equipment better prepared for combat. He claimed that only 55% of the Army reserve are &quot;combat-ready,&quot; and charged that many U.S. warplanes are short on parts.    However, Mr. Dukakis didn't discuss one of the economic realities of any conventional defense buildup: it would cost far more than relying on nuclear weapons.    Following the Georgetown speech, Mr. Dukakis delivered one of the most effective stump speeches of his campaign to an unusually enthusiastic crowd in Annapolis, Md. He sharply criticized Mr. Bush for refusing to participate in a presidential debate that the two political parties had scheduled to be held yesterday in Annapolis.    Then, combining the naval backdrop of Annapolis with a crack at the vice-president's recent dismissal of several advisers for alleged anti-semitism, he said: &quot;Maybe he is so reluctant to debate me because his idea of a Naval exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
