That unsettling question has arisen recently on twofronts: a high-stakes lobbying campaign and a fight over anunusual new American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. venture. Inboth cases, the issue is causing anxiety because few lawsprotect the privacy of phone records even as the technologyto collect and search the records is advancing rapidly.</LP><TEXT>   The ATandamp;T project is an ordinary-sounding series ofspecialty 800-number directories. The first, &quot;Gifts, Catalogsand Celebrations,&quot; was published in October. ATandamp;T plans toput out a book of toll-free travel numbers in January and iscontemplating 10 other directories after that.   What isn't so ordinary is ATandamp;T's method of selecting thehouseholds that will receive the books. The phone giant issearching its electronic phone records for frequent callersof each 800-number category. Thus, ATandamp;T could promiseadvertisers that the first book will reach consumers with aguaranteed appetite for gift and catalog phone services.   The project is drawing criticism because it's a rare caseof phone company marketers exploiting their unique knowledgeof the numbers their customers call.   &quot;This particular application seems to be innocent enough .. . but you cannot easily distinguish it from more intrusiveforms of combing through phone records for marketablenuggets,&quot; says Eli Noam, a Columbia University specialist intelecommunications and law. He dreams up a more offensiveexample: Compiling a list of frequent callers of divorcelawyers and selling it to dating services.   ATandamp;T has also come under fire from an unlikely defender ofprivacy: the direct-marketing industry. After the directorieswere described in the trade weekly DM News, the ChicagoAssociation of Direct Marketing branded the phone books an&quot;invasion of privacy.&quot; The 2,800-member group demanded thatATandamp;T cancel the project or get written permission fromcustomers to have their call records searched.   Direct marketers have an economic reason for fearingATandamp;T's plan: They do a lucrative business selling their ownlists of their most frequent callers.   ATandamp;T dismisses the suggestion that its directories pose athreat to privacy. &quot;We're trying to use this information tohelp our customers save money or make money or save time,&quot;says David Williams, the publisher of ATandamp;T's 800 directories.   He compares searching for frequent 800-number callers toother ways that ATandamp;T analyzes customers' calling patterns formarketing purposes. For instance, the company might offerdiscounts to volume long-distance callers, or a special dealon calls to a particular foreign country.   The ATandamp;T flap comes amid another dispute over the possiblemisuse of phone records for marketing purposes. This one alsoinvolves an industry not normally known for its reverence forprivacy: newspaper publishers.   &quot;Unless they're stopped, the Bells will know more aboutyou than even the IRS,&quot; screams a recent American NewspaperPublishing Association ad with an ominous picture of a longfiling cabinet stretching out of a telephone.   It warns breathlessly that if the phone companies startselling information services, they'll be able to use phonerecords to target-market the services with unsettlingprecision. &quot;Call an obstetrician and you could be delugedwith information on diaper services. . . .&quot;   The newspaper lobby's campaign is part of the latest roundin the phone industry's long battle to sell other servicesover the phone. The 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T banned local phonecompanies from &quot;information&quot; businesses, a broad categoryincluding dial-it lines and other phone-marketing services.   In fact, Harold Greene, the federal judge overseeing thebreakup, explicitly warned four years ago that a phonemonopoly could use &quot;a subscriber's telephone callingpatterns&quot; to target him for other products and services. Thephone company would then &quot;have a `Big Brother' typerelationship with all those residing in its region,&quot; thejudge wrote in a 1987 decision.   But in July, after an appeals court ordered him toreconsider the earlier ban, Judge Greene reluctantly clearedthe way for phone companies to enter information businesses.Since then, the newspaper publishers have been furiouslylobbying Congress to impose its own ban.   Phone companies call the newspapers' visions of usingphone records for marketing surveillance outlandish andalarmist. &quot;It would destroy our business, and we'd never doit in a million years,&quot; says Kenneth Pitt, a Bell AtlanticCorp. spokesman.   Today many phone companies don't normally keep records oftheir customers' local calls, though it wouldn't betechnically hard to do. &quot;We have the physical wherewithal . .. but it's not something we would provide unless customerswere willing to let us do so,&quot; says Kathleen Ahern, NynexCorp.'s director of federal regulatory policy.   Nevertheless, some civil-liberties advocates -- whilestopping well short of the newspaper lobby's Orwellianrhetoric -- do worry that calling records are increasinglyvulnerable to misuse.   &quot;There are very strong industry traditions of protectingthose records -- but the problem is, that tradition isbreaking down,&quot; says Marc Rotenberg, Washington director ofComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility.   As evidence, he cites ATandamp;T's new toll-free directories,&quot;caller ID&quot; services that flash the caller's phone number tothe person on the other end of the line, and the commonpractice of giving proprietors of 800 and 900 lines regularlists of every number that dials them. All these developmentsare slowly undermining consumers' control over who knows thephone numbers they dial, Mr. Rotenberg contends.   One reason for the new concern: The laws on phone-recordprivacy are weak and sometimes contradictory. A few states,including California, generally forbid disclosing phonerecords without a customer's consent. But the federal lawthat protects the confidentiality of phone conversationssuggests it's legal for phone companies to divulge theirrecords.   &quot;A provider of electronic communication service . . . maydisclose a record or other information pertaining to asubscriber&quot; to any private person, states the law, theElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.   The Supreme Court has also taken a dim view of the privacyof phone records. &quot;It is too much to believe that telephonesubscribers . . . harbor any general expectation that thenumbers they dial will remain secret,&quot; the court held in 1979in Smith vs. Maryland. The court ruled that a suspectedrobber &quot;voluntarily conveyed numerical information to thetelephone company&quot; and thus &quot;assumed the risk that theinformation would be divulged&quot; -- in this case to the policewithout a warrant.   Another reason for rising concern is technological:Powerful computers have made it feasible to sift throughmillions of phone records with lightning speed. That powerwas convincingly demonstrated earlier this year, whenCincinnati Bell Inc., as part of a police investigation ofleaks from Procter andamp; Gamble Co., combed the records of morethan 35 million calls from two area codes to find people whodialed a Wall Street Journal reporter.   The growing fears about phone records have even spawned astart-up company. Private Lines Inc. in Beverly Hills,Calif., runs 1-900-STOPPER and seven other phone serviceslike it. For $2 a minute, callers can dial the number and getconnected to any other line. The only call that shows up onthe customer's phone record is the one to the Stopper line.   Some law enforcers are protesting these services, callingthem a perfect tool for evasive criminals. Still, PrivateLines' president, William Dwyer, says the company has handled&quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of calls since it opened for businessa year and a half ago.</TEXT></DOC>
