(that) blew through the windows.&quot;;   Thursday afternoon, she stood on the school playground shaking her head. &quot;Thatused to be my car,&quot; she said, nodding to a scorched Subaru beside thestill-smoking twist of wreckage.;    Parents streamed to the school fromdifferent parts of the city after initial television reports said thehelicopter had crashed into the campus.;    &quot;I panicked,&quot; said Regina White,whose 8-year-old son was at the school. &quot;The closer I got, the more my heartwas beating.&quot;;    Nine-year-old Javance White Jr., who is not related toRegina White, said students in the school thought there had been anearthquake. &quot;I was kind of scared,&quot; Javance said. &quot;We saw all the smoke, andall the people running and screaming. It looked like (the fire) was comingtoward the yard.&quot;;    Film crew members, who started running toward the crashbefore the helicopter actually hit, described the horror of seeing the burnedhelicopter officers, and said they felt utterly helpless. &quot;Cars were alreadyblowing up,&quot; one man said.;    As many as seven news helicopters circling lowoverhead didn't help, one said: &quot;Having all those helicopters flying aroundafter we just saw one go down didn't make anyone on the ground feel anybetter.&quot;;    The city's police department, which has 17 helicopters, has lostfive to crashes since it started flying them more than 20 years ago, spokesmanLawrence said.;    San Jose police Sgt.
