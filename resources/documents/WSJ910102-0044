On average, money fund investors finished the year 7.7%richer, compared with a 6.9% loss for the average stock fundand 3.7% gain for the average bond fund. That means 1990 wasthe worst year for stock funds since 1974.</LP><TEXT>   Every category of stock fund tracked by Lipper AnalyticalServices got hammered, except one: Health and biotechnologyfunds posted an average gain of 18.2%.   Fund analysts are hoping 1991 will be kinder to stockfunds, but the analysts remain cautious. &quot;It's going to be adifficult year, with a good chance that the bear market of1990 will continue into 1991,&quot; says Kenneth Gregory, editorof L/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter. &quot;ButI think the next bull market will start sometime in 1991.&quot;   In 1990, stock fund investors had to contend with morethan just falling stock prices. On May 31, Peter Lynchretired as manager of $11 billion Fidelity Magellan Fund, theU.S.'s largest and most successful stock mutual fund. Mr.Lynch's departure raised the issue of whether fund investorsshould sell if their fund manager jumps ship.   Not that star managers had a great year. Manywell-regarded value managers had a lackluster 1990, includingBaron Asset's Ron Baron, Legg Mason Value Trust's ErnestKiehne, Mutual Shares' Michael Price, Salomon BrothersOpportunity's Irving Brilliant, Southeastern Asset ManagementValue Trust's O. Mason Hawkins, and Windsor Fund's John Neff.   With all the concern over star fund managers, stock indexfunds would seem a natural beneficiary. These funds merelybuy and hold the stocks that make up a particular stockmarket index, and thereby hope to track the index'sperformance.   The oldest and most successful of these funds is VanguardGroup's 500 Portfolio, which seeks to track the Standard andamp;Poor's 500 Stock Index. Vanguard's success prompted otherfund groups to launch index funds of their own, most notablyDreyfus Corp. and Fidelity Investments.   But what seemed likely to become the year's hottestmarketing battle fizzled when the stock market tumbled. Byyear end, Dreyfus's index fund boasted assets of $37 million,and Fidelity's fund had garnered just $59 million.   &quot;Indexing, in spite of its undeniable merits, hasn't yettaken off,&quot; says John Bogle, Vanguard's chairman. But, hesays, &quot;I think we'll see a very measurable increase inindexing in the coming year.&quot;   In early 1990, stock fund sales chugged along at a recordpace. But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait nixed that, with $2.8billion flowing from stock funds in August and an additional$484 million in September. (These numbers include sales lessredemptions plus the net effect of switches among stock fundsand other funds in the same fund group. Reinvested dividendsare excluded.)   But after that initial rash of redemptions, stock fundinvestors began venturing back into stock funds in Octoberand November. &quot;The stability of mutual fund investors wasquite astonishing,&quot; says Vanguard's Mr. Bogle.   Where will the money be made in stock funds in 1991? Smallcompany stock funds, which were battered in 1990, continue toattract those with a contrarian bent.   &quot;I don't know what the best investments will be incalendar year 1991,&quot; says Mr. Gregory, the newsletter editor.&quot;But for people who are making long-term investments, I thinkit's a good time to start accumulating funds that invest insmall company stocks.&quot;   Some commentators looked for a rebound among junk-bondfunds in 1990, but they were disappointed. Through the first11 months of 1990, the average junk-bond fund had a totalreturn, including both share price change and dividends, of anegative 11.3%.   That performance prompted a continued flood of money outof junk-bond funds. Junk funds suffered net outflows in 14 ofthe previous 17 months.   But it wasn't just junk-bond investors who had problems in1990. First Investors Consolidated Corp., one of the biggestmanagers of junk-bond mutual funds, stopped selling shares oftheir two large junk-bond funds after New York andMassachusetts alleged that the firm engaged in widespreadsales fraud. The two states claim that the funds were soldbased on yield, and that investors weren't told about therisks involved.   Not all bond funds performed poorly. A new breed ofshort-term global bond fund was among the few types of mutualfunds to outpace the drab but safe money funds. Through thefirst 11 months of 1990, these funds were up 17.2%.   Even timid money fund investors didn't have a worry-free1990. In March, Mortgage andamp; Realty Trust defaulted on $167million of debt, thus threatening the stable $1 share priceof 10 mutual funds. Rather than see their money funds &quot;breakthe buck,&quot; fund companies like T. Rowe Price Associates andAlliance Capital Management bought the defaulted commercialpaper held by their money funds.   The Mortgage andamp; Realty Trust default raised concerns thatthere might be another commercial paper default, and thistime one of the fund companies involved wouldn't eat theloss. In response, the Securities and Exchange Commissionproposed tightening the rules on what sort of commercialpaper a fund can buy. New guidelines are likely to be issuedearly this year.   In 1991, the SEC will also decide whether to restrict the12b-1 marketing and distribution fee that many mutual fundscharge. But this year's most important SEC initiative islikely to be a revamping of the Investment Company Act of1940, which governs the way funds operate.   Though stock funds generally had a rough year, the biggestlosers may well have been those that got caught up in thecountry fund craze. Speculative buying pushed up the price ofthese publicly traded funds, which trade on the stock marketjust like IBM or GE. As a result, shareholders were buyingfunds for far more than the value of the underlyingportfolio.   At the end of 1989, for example, investors in the SpainFund were paying $2.30 for every $1 of portfolio value.Germany Fund investors were forking over $1.58 for every $1of portfolio value. But country fund fever faded as 1990 woreon, and today buyers of these funds typically don't have topay premium prices.   Country funds were &quot;the sort of thing that nobody in theirright mind should have bought,&quot; says Kurt Brouwer, presidentof San Francisco's Brouwer andamp; Janachowski. &quot;It was prettyugly.&quot;   ---         How Different Types of Mutual Funds Fared                                                                                                                                           % CHANGE       % CHANGE                                 12/29/89 TO    12/30/88 TO                                    12/27/90       12/29/89                                                                                                          Health/biotech.                   +18.16%        +43.50%   World income                      +12.52         + 6.02   Fixed income                      + 3.70         + 9.44   Balanced                          - 0.67         +19.42   Utility                           - 1.55         +28.96   Flexible portfolio                - 1.71         +17.05   Science andamp; tech.                   - 3.74         +22.06   Option income                     - 3.84         +12.48   Global flex. portfolio            - 4.49         +18.31   Growth andamp; income                   - 5.10         +23.23   Growth                            - 6.11         +25.44   Equity income                     - 6.61         +21.37   Convertible secs.                 - 8.03         +13.61   Cap. appreciation                 - 8.67         +23.91   Natural resources                 - 8.82         +32.13   Small co. growth                  -10.86         +22.97   Global                            -11.34         +21.72   Specialty/misc.                   -12.42         +23.64   International                     -12.88         +22.25   Financial services                -15.18           N.A.
