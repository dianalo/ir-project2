The Brooklyn-based bank also said it expects approval fromfederal regulators of its revised plan to convert debt andpreferred stock to equity to raise its capital levels.</LP><TEXT>   CrossLand said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $169.3million, or $12.49 a share, compared with a loss of $31.7million, or $3.04 a share, a year earlier.   Results for the quarter include a loan-loss provision of$88.8 million and $54.9 million in write-downs of certainreal estate assets. In the 1989 quarter, CrossLand had a lossprovision of $7.5 million and took $7.6 million inwrite-downs.   For the full year, CrossLand reported a loss of $421.1million, or $33.09 a share, compared with a loss of $191.7million, or $16.85 a share, in 1989. Maurice L. Reissman,CrossLand's chairman, said a large portion of the losses in1990 -- about $353 million -- were from loans, particularlyresidential construction loans, and real estate investments.   In 1990, loss provisions totaled $247.7 million, comparedwith $50.9 million in 1989, and write-downs were $105.5million, compared with $8.1 million. The bank also took a $43million loss in 1990 on the sale of the remnants of its junkbond portfolio.   CrossLand said it filed its new capital-raising planThursday, and in the next few weeks will submit to federalregulators its proxy materials for reclassification ofapproximately $336 million in cumulative preferred stock tocommon. The plan includes a proposal that $175 million incapital notes be exchanged into either common ornon-cumulative preferred stock, which would qualify as corecapital.   CrossLand said it expects to meet regulator'sminimum-capital requirements of 3% this year and 5% by theend of 1994. &quot;The capital plan should be encouraging. As longas the downturn in real estate doesn't continue at the paceit has been, we should become healthy in 1991,&quot; Mr. Reissmansaid.   Mr. Reissman added that Friday's drop in the prime rateshould help to improve the bank's net interest income. In thequarter, net interest income was $18.6 million, compared with$41.8 million in 1989. In all of 1990 it was $110.1 million,compared with $212 million a year earlier.   The bank's assets stood at $11.2 billion at year end, downfrom $14.1 billion in 1989. Mr. Reissman said the bank willreduce assets to under $10 billion in 1991 by sellingancillary businesses such as its mortgage or premium fundingcompanies, as well as certain branches outside the New Yorkarea. He said the bank will focus on retail customers andresidential mortgage lending in the New York and New Jerseymarkets.</TEXT></DOC>
