Newton C. Estes, 62, Kaysville, was bound over for trialfollowing a hearing Monday before 4th Circuit Judge K. Roger Bean.   The charges, filed Jan. 25, involve an 11-year-old girl whoworked as a housekeeper at the Estes home.   Estes is charged with showing the girl pictures of nude peopleand asking her to assume the same poses. The girl said that on oneoccasion, Estes removed her clothes, fondled her and gave her anextra $5 in wages, court documents said.   Estes recently asked Bean to drop the charges because newscoverage of his previous and current court involvement was damaginghis ability to make a living in Utah. He asked the charges bedropped so he could sell his house and move out of the state.   The judge said it was not appropriate for him to be involved innegotiations of this type.   Estes was fined $500 and sentenced to 10 days in jail and twoyears probation after he punched Justice Byron R. White three timesduring a Utah State Bar convention in Salt Lake City on July 15,1982. White suffered a minor abrasion of the cheek.   Estes said the attack was to protest court rulings onpornography and school busing. ``He's causing four-letter words tocome into my living room through the TV set. The only way I knowhow to stop it is to go to the source,'' he told reporters at thetime.</TEXT></DOC>
