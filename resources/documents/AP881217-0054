Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem cleric was quoted assaying he had ``suspended'' efforts to win the release of 14foreigners held hostage. His comment was published today, one dayafter a Swiss hostage was freed.   ``I have suspended my initiative on behalf of the hostagesbecause it reached a dead end,'' the Beirut daily newspaper Al-Liwaaquoted Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah as saying. Fadlallah is thespiritual guide of Hezbollah, the umbrella group for pro-Iranianfactions holding most hostages.   Red Cross worker Peter Winkler, 32, was freed Friday night inHisbeh Square in the southern city of Sidon, the same spot where hewas abducted Nov. 17. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said Winkler wouldprobably fly home Sunday via Cyprus.   The abduction of the Irish soldiers occurred Friday in Tibnin, avillage bordering Israel's self-proclaimed security zone. Theabductions were apparently intended to retaliate for Israel'sseizure Thursday of guerrilla commander Jawad Kasfi in Tibnin.   Police sources said the kidnappers demanded the U.N. InterimForce in Lebanon, with which the Irish soldiers served, negotiatewith Israel for the release of Kasfi and three other guerrillasseized Thursday by Israel.   The Israeli military command said Kasfi was suspected oforganizing and participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacksagainst Israeli army forces and the allied South Lebanon Armymilitia since 1984.   Today's rescue was daring, resulting in the capture of 22 Shiitezealots who helped abduct the Irish soldiers, a police spokesmansaid.   The spokesman said the three were rescued from a house inSultaniyeh, a village one mile outside Tibnin, headquarters of the620-strong Irish battalion serving with the U.N. peacekeeping force.   The rescue operation, according to the spokesman, was completedat dawn when 15 guerrillas of the ``Faithful Resistance surrenderedto Amal and set free the three Irish soldiers.''   The Faithful Resistance is a small group of Shiitefundamentalists affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God.   ``The fighters surrendered after Amal militiamen, in a smart andquiet move, arrested the Faithful Resistance's seven commanders inthe whole region,'' the spokesman said. ``The fighters surrenderedbecause they didn't know what to do after Amal arrested theircommanders. They surrendered peacefully.''   Winkler, who spoke to journalists as he was driven out of Sidonon his way to Beirut, said of his captivity, ``I've never known thatfour weeks can be as long as that.''   Asked if he would resume Red Cross work in Lebanon, Winkler said:``I'm afraid I will have to leave Lebanon soon. ... My enthusiasmhas suffered.''   Winkler looked fit, with no sign of maltreatment.   In Bern, Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said today thatWinkler's captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence fora jailed Lebanese plane hijacker, Hussein Hariri, but Switzerlandrefused any concessions.   Felber said that in indirect contacts, the kidnappers identifiedthemselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group named``Organization of Socialist Revolution.''   Sweden's ambassador in Damascus, Rolf Gauffin, acted asintermediary after the hijackers contacted him Tuesday, Felber tolda press conference. He said recent talks between a Swiss officialand Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat also were``useful.'' He did not elaborate.   At a news conference in Tunisia today, Arafat suggested, withoutproviding any details, that he played a role in the freeing Winkler.   Edouard Brunner, the Swiss Foreign Ministry's No. 2 man, metArafat Wednesday when the PLO chief was in Geneva for a U.N. GeneralAssembly session.   Brunner told reporters today that Arafat asked for a drawing ofthe place where Winkler was kidnapped to determine whether it was inPalestinian-controlled territory.   The recent political successes of the PLO may also havecontributed to Winkler's early release, Brunner said.   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station saidWinkler was released by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, theguerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.   A police spokesman quoted Winkler as saying he did not know theidentity of those who held him but that the captors told him ``thatI was being held to guarantee that Hussein Hariri will be treatedwell in Switzerland.''   Hariri, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese, goes on trial in Lausanne onFeb. 20 on charges of hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner on July 14,1987, and forcing it to land at Geneva airport. He is accused ofkilling a French passenger.   Winkler's release leaves 14 foreigners, including nine Americans,held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
