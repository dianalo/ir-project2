MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many shuttered stores reopened todayand opponents of the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ponderedtheir next move as a general strike wound down.   President Reagan indicated today he believes Noriega must go.Secretary of State George P. Shultz said economic sanctions againstNoriega's government were being ``considered carefully.''   Local banks, closed since the strike began Monday, were toreopen at midday. At least two factories in the city's mainindustrial park _ a ghost town for the past three days _ resumedwork this morning, with others preparing to do so.   Anti-riot police made a show of force early today along Calle50, the scene of disturbances Tuesday and Wednesday. At least threetruckloads of the troopers _ whose corps is called the``Dobermans'' _ took up positions at strategic intersections.   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade said they would decidetonight whether to call off the strike, which has lasted longerthan any of the five shutdowns staged last year by the oppositioncoalition.   A member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, meanwhile, was quoted bya Panama City newspaper as denying reports that Noriega was purginghis armed forces.   National assemblyman Guillermo Cochez, of the oppositionChristian Democratic Party, said Wednesday at a news conferencethat Noriega had ordered the early retirements of two colonels andtwo majors he suspected of wavering loyalty.   But Joint Chiefs member Col. Leonidas Macias told thepro-government newspaper ``La Estrella'' that ``here everything isnormal and no one has been retired or dismissed.''   On Wednesday, organizers called the strike their most successfulyet. The United States also stepped up economic pressure onPanama's military strongman.   Doctors on Wednesday joined businesses in the strike. Organizerssaid they would increase street demonstrations that have broughtscattered violence to the capital.   Reagan was asked in Brussels, where he attended a NATO summit,if he thought Noriega should relinquish power.   ``Yes,'' the president responded. He did not elaborate.   Shultz called Noriega ``bad news'' but said that no decision hadbeen made on sanctions.   Noriega, chief of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, has run thecountry since 1983. He was indicted in the United States last monthon charges of trafficking in cocaine.   In June, his former second-in-command went public with chargesthat Noriega was involved in election fraud, corruption andpolitical assassinations. Noriega has denied those accusations.   In Washington, U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday that they willask U.S. banks to freeze Panamanian government assets and delaypayment of Panama Canal tolls to the military-dominated government.   Panama is thought to have up to $50 million on deposit in sevenU.S. banks and its share of canal fees comes to about $7 million amonth.   The sanctions were recommended by William D. Rogers, whoseWashington law firm represents Panama's deposed president, EricArturo Delvalle.   The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theState Department was acting on the Rogers recommendations becauseit recognizes Delvalle as Panama's lawful head of state.   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for Latin Americanaffairs, told Cable News Network in Washington that the StateDepartment would advise American bankers to withhold funds from thePanamanian government.   ``Delvalle is president of Panama. And Noriega has been firedand he does not have legitimate authority here,'' he said.   Manuel Solis Palma, installed as Panama's new chief of state,said Wednesday that he had no official knowledge of the U.S. plan.   Delvalle attempted to fire Noriega last week, prompting theNoriega-controlled National Assembly to remove him. Delvalle wentinto hiding, apparently in Panama.   Strike organizers claimed ship traffic through the Panama Canalwas halted for an hour Wednesday by Panamanian workers.   The Panama Canal Commission said traffic was normal. Thecommission also said it received two phony bomb threats Wednesdayand Tuesday, adding that they had not disrupted operation of thewaterway.</TEXT></DOC>
