The gain equals $1.25 a share. The transaction is expected to be completed Friday.    Consolidation Coal exercised its purchase option for Quarto Mining; the option had been assigned by a group of utilities. As a result of the sale, Nacco will receive about $15.2 million, $5.2 million of which will be paid at closing and the balance in installments.    The terms also stipulate that Quarto pay a $10 million dividend to a Nacco subsidiary, North American Coal, before closing.    In 1986, Quarto generated $5.9 million of Nacco's $33.3 million of profit, equal to 62 cents of the holding company's total $3.48 earnings per share. Nacco reported 1986 second-quarter profit of $10.8 million, or $1.11 a share, on sales of $142.8 million.    Besides North American Coal, Nacco owns 85% of another operating subsidiary, Yale Materials Handling Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
