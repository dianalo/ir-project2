Since those men _ all but one of them Shiite Moslems _ were putbehind bars, their comrades have hijacked airliners, kidnappedAmericans and other foreigners and carried out bombing attacks andassassinations.   The Shiites who hijacked Kuwait Airways Flight 422 on April 5have one demand: the release of the 17 men convicted of a series ofbombings in Kuwait in December 1983 that killed five people andwounded 61. Kuwait refuses.   The bombings were part of an Iranian-inspired campaign todestabilize Kuwait, which has a substantial Shiite minority, andwhich Tehran accuses of helping Iraq in their 7{-year-old war.   Dozens of other Shiites have been jailed in Kuwait for bombings,but no one has demanded their release.   ``There's a thread running through all these events that beganwith the 1983 bombings,'' Ian Geldard of the London-based Institutefor the Study of Terrorism said in a telephone interview.   He and other specialists traced the chain of violence to onemastermind, Imad Mughniyeh, 36, a Lebanese Shiite who is a securitychief of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, an umbrella organization whosename means Party of God.   Among the 17, three have been sentenced to death. One of thethree is Elias Saab, whose real name is Mustapha Youssef Badreddin.He is Mughniyeh's cousin and brother-in-law.   ``At the end of the day, it's Mughniyeh who's been responsiblefor most of this violence,'' Geldard said.   Some passengers freed by the hijackers of the Kuwaiti jet said aman boarded the plane last week when it landed at Mashhad innortheast Iran shortly after being seized.   Palestinian negotiatiors in Cyprus, where the plane flew next,said the hijackers' leader, who they called ``experienced,'' nevershowed himself and they speculated that he might be Mughniyeh. Theplane later flew to Algeria where the hijackers refused to freetheir 32 remaining hostages.   Mughniyeh disappeared in Beirut, where he has his headquarters,several weeks ago after returning from Iran, informed souces saidon condition of anonymity.   Another leading Shiite militant in Lebanon, Hussein Musawi,leader of Islamic Amal which is linked to Hezbollah, also has beeninvolved in the violence, Geldard said.   One of Musawi's cousins, Hassan Youssef Musawi, is among the 17held in Kuwait and is serving a life sentence.   ``The family connections involved here are the reason there'sbeen such a passionate intensity involved in this campaign,''Geldard said.   The 17 are members of the Iranian-based al-Dawaa, or The Call, amovement of dissident Iraqi Shiite fundamentalists opposed to theBaghdad government of President Saddam Hussein. Al-Dawaa is closelylinked with Hezbollah.   In Baghdad in 1980, Hussein publicly beheaded the movement'sfounder Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric and close friend ofIran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   U.S. and Lebanese intelligence officials said Mughniyeh and hisclan were behind the kidnappings of Americans and Frenchmen inLebanon that began in 1984.   Intelligence organizations consider Hezbollah, al-Dawaa andIslamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, one and the same, part of anincreasingly potent terrorist network that leads to Tehran.   Here are some of the events that stemmed from the conviction ofthe 17 bombers.   _Dec. 4, 1984: Five Arabs hijack a Kuwaiti airliner and demandthe release of the 17. They fly the plane to Tehran and kill twoAmerican passengers. Iranian security men storm the plane afterfive days and capture the hijackers, who later vanish. Westernintelligence believes the Iranians let them go.   _March 16, 1985: Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press is kidnapped in Beirut byIslamic Jihad. Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, arenow held in Lebanon.   _May 4, 1985: Islamic Jihad warns there will be ``catastrophicconsequences'' if Kuwait does not free the 17.   _May 25, 1985: The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-AhmedAl-Sabah, narrowly escapes assasination when a Shiite suicidebomber rams a car loaded with explosives into his motorcade inKuwait. Two of the emir's bodyguards and the bomber were killed.Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.   _June 14, 1985: Shiites hijack a TWA airliner and fly it toBeirut, demanding the release of the 17 and more than 700 Arabsheld by Israel. A U.S. Navy diver is killed and 39 Americans heldhostage for 17 days before being freed after Syrian intervention.U.S. authorities name Mughniyeh as one of the suspected hijackers.   _July 24, 1987: After a string of bombings in Kuwait, a21-year-old Lebanese Shiite member of Hezbollah, Hussein Hariri,hijacks an Air Afrique jetliner to Zurich, demanding the release inWest Germany of another Shiite held there for the TWA hijacking.The plane's crew overwhelm Hariri after he kills a French passenger.</TEXT></DOC>
