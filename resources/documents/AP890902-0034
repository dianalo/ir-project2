(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tammy Faye Bakker says she can't understandwhy the government imprisoned and humiliated her TV evangelisthusband, whose psychiatric episode she blames on an allergicreaction to medicine.   ``They strip-searched him in front of a room full of men andthrew him in a jail cell,'' Mrs. Bakker said after a six-hourmeeting with her husband, PTL founder Jim Bakker, Friday night.``Jim said it was the most humiliating thing he had ever beenthrough.''   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker to the FederalCorrectional Institution at Butner for psychiatric evaluation afterthe evangelist broke down Thursday in the fourth day of his fraudand conspiracy trial in Charlotte.   The judge heard Bakker's psychiatrist, Dr. Basil Jackson, testifythat Bakker hallucinated when he left the courthouse Wednesday aftera witness fainted.   Jackson said he prescribed the anti-depressant sedative Xanax forBakker but his condition worsened until Thursday morning he curledup in a fetal position in his attorney's office with his head undera couch.   ``There is no reason at all for Jim to be in prison,'' Mrs.Bakker said. Speaking of the medication she said: ``He justliterally had more than he could handle. I think Judge Potter isbeing very unfair.''   However, The Charlotte Observer today quoted Jackson as sayingthe amount of medication Bakker had been given ``was infinitesimalbecause I recognized his concern about overreaction.''   According to the Physicians' Desk Reference, rare side effects ofXanax, which is similar to Valium, include hallucinations, agitationand other behavioral effects.   Mrs. Bakker said her husband is ``very allergic to allmedication.'' She said, ``He doesn't even take aspirin.''   She said her husband looked much more composed than he hadThursday when he sobbed on his way to prison.   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer who has co-starred with Bakker ontheir talk-show style religious TV programs, said Bakker did notfake his attack as skeptics have suggested.   ``If you had seen Mr. Bakker, you would know he doesn't perform.He's just Jim, not a performer,'' she said.   Mrs. Bakker traveled from her home in Orlando, Fla., to visit herhusband. She said she would be visiting him daily and hoped he wouldbe able to resume his trial next week.   When Potter dismissed jurors Thursday _ without telling them why_ the judge said they would not be needed for a week.   Government psychiatrists began evaluating Bakker on Friday, saidprison spokeswoman Sharon Orr. She would not characterize his mentalstate or actions.   ``Normally, an evaluation takes 30 to 45 days, but it has notbeen determined at this time how long this particular evaluationwill take,'' she said.   ``The initial process is a thorough physical. ... In the mentalhealth unit, a team made up of a psychiatrist and psychologist, thepsychiatric nursing staff, a case manager and a personal counselorconduct the evaluation,'' she said.   Mrs. Orr said Bakker has the option of wearing the standardorange prison jumpsuit or street clothes. He also is free to roamthe grounds of the 700-acre prison, which houses about 800 inmates.   ``That's his choice because he is not a convicted or sentencedprisoner,'' she said.   Mrs. Bakker said her husband described his room as having bars onthe window. He told her that his meals are pushed through a windowin the door and he has to wear handcuffs every time he comes out ofhis room, she said.   Butner is one of three federal prison hospitals in the nationthat do psychiatric evaluations.   Bakker, accused of using nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance a lavish lifestyle, has previously acknowledged suffering anervous breakdown 20 years ago and considering suicide during a 1981separation from his wife. Former PTL workers say Bakker was given tofrequent attacks of anger or depression.</TEXT></DOC>
