KROPKO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chief of staff of a Veterans Administrationhospital on Friday defended the institution's medical care, callinga critical network television report erroneous and distorted.   But in Washington, one Ohio senator called for an investigationand another called for the hospital director's suspension until thematter is resolved.   ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' reported Thursday that it used hiddencameras to record examples of unsanitary conditions and poorpatient care during three days at the Wade Park VA Hospital.   The hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Murray Altose, blasted thereport as unfair.   ``I'm saying it isn't substantiated and it's grosslydistorted,'' Altose said. ``It's not the way things are at thismedical center. That picture was a grossly distorted representationthat's full of patently erroneous allegations.''   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said House Veterans AffairsCommittee Chairman G.V. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., has agreed toinvestigate the allegations.   Sen John Glenn, D-Ohio, also called for Veterans AffairsSecretary Ed Derwinski to investigate, and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,D-Ohio, said the hospital's director, Dr. Peter Stajduhar, shouldbe suspended until the issue is resolved.   ``PrimeTime Live'' reported that, among other things,bloodstained needles were not disposed of properly, asbestos wasremoved near patient quarters and one paralyzed patient was not fedfor three days.   Altose said that there are likely to be some failings in thequality of medical care in any large hospital dealing withseriously ill patients.   He also said it was improper to draw conclusions based on thebrief video shown in the report.   The Cleveland hospital was selected for the investigationbecause it was ``a typical representation'' of the care at VAhospitals, ABC spokeswoman Rena Terracuso said.   Altose said the allegations would be investigated and a VAmedical inspector would visit the hospital.   ``We welcome that visit,'' he said. ``We trust that he will lookat, in depth, the goings on in this place and establish clearly, aswe contend, that there is absolutely nothing to hide. There are notterrible things going on. This is in fact a fine medical center.''</TEXT></DOC>
