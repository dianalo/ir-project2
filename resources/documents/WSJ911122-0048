Significant differences between the bills remain to beworked out in a conference that is likely to begin thisweekend. The Senate bill is considerably broader than theHouse measure. The Senate included a floating cap oncredit-card interest rates that Republicans contend wouldprompt President Bush to veto the bill, and the Senate billwould allow banks to establish nationwide branch systems, achange that the administration has listed among its toppriorities.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're very pleased with the interstate branchingprovision, which will help protect the taxpayer from anypotential losses by strengthening the U.S. banking system,&quot; aTreasury statement said. &quot;We will work with the conferees toremove the credit-card cap. We don't believe Congress wouldsupport a bill which would severely impede economic recovery,cause a shortage of much-needed capital and take credit cardsaway from low- and middle-income Americans.&quot;   Lawmakers found the legislation an unpleasant reminder ofthe costly collapse of the savings-and-loan industry. Yetwhen the final votes came, passage was achieved withsurprising ease. On its third try this month, the Houseapproved the measure 344-84. After two broader versions ofthe bill failed, the House stripped out all but the leastcontroversial elements of the bill -- leaving in the money tosupport deposit insurance and the tougher bank regulation.   In the Senate, the bill passed on a voice vote afterseveral days of compromises. &quot;A lot of people don't want tovote for $70 billion to refinance the bank fund,&quot; said SenateBanking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), whoengineered the bill's passage. &quot;And there's a lot of concernthat {$70 billion} may not be enough&quot; to cover the cost ofthe worst rash of bank failures since the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. was established during the Depression.   In the end, lawmakers endorsed the legislation asnecessary to assure depositors that their money is safe whenbank failures are running at a post-Depression high. &quot;We mustmaintain and restore confidence in the banking system,&quot; Rep.Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio) said. &quot;We must tell depositors thatthe money will be there&quot; if their bank fails.   &quot;The financial and other sectors of the economy areflashing red warning signs,&quot; said Sen. Riegle. &quot;The Senatehas sent the message that we are acting on those warnings,even though the problems are complex and there are no quickor easy answers. I hope this signal will help begin torebuild confidence in our financial industry and oureconomy.&quot;   After Senate passage, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, theRepublican manager of the bill, said there was no chance thatthe credit-card interest rate cap would become law, in theface of projections that it would reduce credit access formillions of consumers. The Senate bill would impose afloating limit that would initially lower credit-cardinterest rates to 14% from an average of 18.9%.   There isn't a comparable version in the House bill,although House members may propose during conferencenegotiations an alternative calling for a study that couldlead to a rate cap. The administration and the banking andretailing industries oppose the study as well.   The administration launched the legislation with a broadbank-law modernization proposal last spring. But lobbying bybankers, insurance interests and securities firms at timesseemed to paralyze lawmakers.   Both chambers deleted proposals to allow banks to movefurther into the securities business. The House stripped outmost insurance changes, protecting many existing bankinsurance powers that insurance groups had tried to pareback.   To pave the way toward interstate branch banking, theSenate reached compromises to address insurance agents' fearsthat insurance sales by banks with nationwide branch networkswould soak up too much of their business. One provisionrestricts banks from selling insurance nationwide but allowsbank subsidiaries to sell insurance across the nation afterimposing limits on dealings between banks and their insuranceunits. Insurance agents want to prevent Citicorp and otherlarge banking concerns from marketing insurance to theircredit-card customers.   In addition, the Senate bill generally preserves the rightof Citicorp and Bankers Trust Co. to underwrite insurancethrough Delaware-based securities firms but bars banks fromgetting underwriting authority after yesterday. The Delawarecongressional delegation fought hard to remove insurancerestrictions from the House and Senate bills.   The Senate passed its bill after adopting a flurry ofamendments. Some of them could have far-reachingconsequences. One gives bank regulators expanded authority torequire weak banks to merge with healthier banks. Another isdesigned to prevent &quot;excessive&quot; compensation for bank andthrift executives. A third is designed to prevent the FDICfrom reversing the sale of credit-card receivables by banksthat subsequently fail.   The provisions in the Senate and House bills to rebuildthe bank insurance fund and tighten bank regulation differ onmany details, but they agree in the following general areas:   -- FDIC funding: They bolster the shrinking bank depositinsurance fund with $70 billion in borrowing authority, partto be repaid by premiums banks pay on domestic deposits andpart to be repaid as the FDIC sells the assets of failedbanks.   -- Deposit insurance: The bills seek to end the so-calledtoo-big-to-fail doctrine, under which the government protectsall deposits -- even those beyond the $100,000 insurancelimit -- in most banks. The FDIC's current ability toreimburse uninsured deposits -- those over $100,000 andforeign deposits -- would be sharply limited after 1994. TheFederal Reserve Board's ability to keep banks alive withextended loans would be restricted.   Only the best-capitalized banks would be able to offerinsured brokered deposits -- large certificates of depositsold through brokerage firms -- or to insure accountsestablished under employee pension plans.   In the future, the premiums banks pay for depositinsurance would be based on risk. Today, they're the same forall banks.   -- Bank regulation: The bills would establish a newframework for bank regulation. As capital declines,regulators would have to move quickly to halt dividends orchange management.   Regulators would have to close banks when capital fallsbelow 2% of assets, unless the banks were profitable and inthe process of boosting their capital. The bill also wouldrequire regulators to perform annual on-site bankexaminations, place limits on real estate lending by banksand tighten auditing requirements.   -- Foreign banks: In response to the problems disclosed bythe collapse of fraud-riddled Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational, the legislation would give the Federal Reservenew authority to police foreign banks' U.S. operations.</TEXT></DOC>
