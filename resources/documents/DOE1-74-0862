<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0862 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Athabasca basin contains some 14% of the reasonably assured, low costuranium reserves of the western world. It comprises a 1400 m thick, redbed succession, the Athabasca Group of Paleohelikian (ca. 1450 Ma) ageand occupies an area of some 100,000 km/sup 2/. Fluviatile quartz sandstonesand conglomerates give way upward to finer marine clastics and tese inturn to stromatolitic and oolitic dolomite. Cross-cutting northwesterlytrending diabase dykes are dated at bewteen 938 and 1230 Ma. The AthabascaGroup is underlain by a lateritic weathering profile in crystalline basementrocks belonging to two major subdivisions of the Saskatchewan Shield,the Cree Lake (Mobile) Zone and Western Craton. These are separated bya major shear zone, within a zone of low gravity which is locally intrudedby Hudsonian (ca. 1750 Ma) uranium enriched 'granite'. Recognizable controlsof Athabasca Basin uranium mineralization are: (a) the sub-AthabascaGroup unconformity, (b) fracturing and faulting, and (c) graphite inbasement rocks. The deposits exhibit, to varying degrees, complex mineralogyand geochemistry (U +- Ni, Co, As, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Au, Pt group elements,Mo, V, Se, Mn and Fe). They are surrounded by extensive argillic alterationhaloes in the Athabasca Group and more restricted haloes in the basement.Redox relationships are characteristic of most deposits. Dating of pitchblendeand alteration minerals suggests epigenetic emplacement beginning 1350Ma ago. Fluid inclusion studies indicate deposition from saline mineralizingfluids at temperatures between 150 and 225 deg. C. The most acceptablemodel of deposit genesis, the diagenetichydrothermal model, involvesinteraction of hot, oxidized, metalliferous formational waters of theAthabasca Group with the underlying 'reduced' basement. Mineralizationwas episodic and likely triggered by tectonic events, possibly relatedto diabase dyke emplacement and/or uplift. 97 refs, 13 figs, 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
