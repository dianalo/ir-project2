U.S. District Judge David Kenyon ordered attorneys for the newsmedia, the government and other interested parties to submit papersand be prepared to present arguments July 22 at 2 p.m. PDT.   Federal judges in three other jurisdictions _ Minneapolis,Brooklyn, N.Y., and Alexandria, Va. _ rejected other efforts Fridayto unseal affidavits concerning the probe.   The massive investigation, which became public last month,centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribedPentagon officials for information that helped contractors winmultimillion-dollar contracts.   Kenyon's decision blocked action on a ruling hours before byU.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann ordering release of sealedaffidavits filed with warrants to search the offices of threeSouthern California defense contractors and one defense consultant.   Reichmann's ruling on a request by attorneys for the Los AngelesTimes, Copley Newspapers and the National Broadcasting Corp. wasimmediately appealed by the government, bringing the case to Kenyon.   Kenyon said his office had been inundated with calls, many ofthem from people who claimed an interest in keeping the documentssecret, and he said he wanted them to give them a chance to beheard.   An attorney for one of those individuals appeared in thecourtroom but refused to identify the person he represented. Thelawyer, Gordon O'Connell, said he would tell the judge in a sealeddocument the identity of his client, but wouldn't tell anyone else.   He said the person is an employee of one of the companies whoseplants were searched.   An attorney for the Los Angeles Times said it was likely theissue wouldn't be resolved until it reaches the 9th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals. He urged Kenyon to move more swiftly so appealscould go forward, but the judge said he felt a week was areasonable continuance.   The government made one concession when it proposed releasinginnocuous ``boilerplate'' sections of each search warrant such asits title and description of the FBI agents who executed thewarrant and of the premises searched. But O'Connell objected, andKenyon said he would review the ``boilerplate'' sections privatelyand rule Monday if they can be released.   In his earlier ruling, Reichmann was adamant about the public'sright to know.   ``Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart ofhow our government functions,'' Reichmann said.   ``We are talking about the foundations of our country, thedefense of our country,'' Reichmann said in ruling that the publichas the right to know through the news media about matters of suchnational importance.   Defense consultant Fred Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty,said he wanted the affidavit released so he could represent hisclient properly.   The warrants sought in Los Angeles were used June 13 to searchthe offices of Northrop Corp., Teledyne Inc., Litton Industries andLackner's home. They were among 33 search warrants executed acrossthe country that day.   Affidavits attached to the warrants contain statements frominvestigators disclosing evidence they uncovered throughcourt-ordered eavesdropping and detailing what they are seekingthrough their searches.   In Minneapolis, U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd refused the StarTribune's request to unseal documents related to the search ofUnisys Corp.'s offices in Eagan, Minn. But Cudd ordered prosecutorsto explain in writing why they wanted the documents kept secret,and set another hearing for Friday.   In Brooklyn, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered theunsealing of four search warrants, but kept the affidavits secret.He postponed opening the warrants until Wednesday to give thegovernment time to appeal.   Korman's ruling was made on a motion filed by Newsday, thenewspaper headquartered on Long Island.   The search warrants that Korman said could be made publicinclude those used at the Long Island home of Charles F. Gardner, adefense consultant who is a former vice president for the UnisysCorp.; the office of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys employee at itsGreat Neck, N.Y., plant; the offices of the Hazeltine Corp. inGreenlawn, N.Y.; and the Kane Paper Corp. in Baldwin, N.Y., whichsupplies paper products to aerospace companies.   In Alexandria, Va., two federal judges refused to unsealaffidavits used to search the office and home of former Navyofficial Melvyn Paisley, and the premises of Thomas Muldoon ofWashington, D.C. Both men are defense consultants. Attorneys forPaisley and Muldoon had sought access to the documents but were notseeking full public release.   In a related development Friday, St. Louis-based McDonnellDouglas Corp. said its consulting contract with Paisley has beenterminated early ``by mutual agreement.''   ``It was decided under the present circumstances that Mr.Paisley did not have the time to devote to his contract,'' saidMcDonnell Douglas spokesman Mike Burch. He said Paisley had been aconsultant to the company since shortly after leaving the Pentagonin 1987 and had assisted ``with a wide range of our product lines,both military and commercial.''   Burch said he didn't know when Paisley's contract was due toexpire. He refused to disclose how much McDonnell Douglas has paidPaisley.   After resigning his post as the Navy's assistant secretary forresearch, engineering and systems, Paisley became a consultant toseveral contractors, including McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta,Pratt andamp; Whitney and LTV.   A search warrant made public last week said the FBI suspectedthat Paisley accepted bribes or gratuities from McDonnell Douglasand two other contractors while he was serving at the Pentagon.   Paisley has also lost Unisys Corp. as a client as thecorporation ended all contracts with defense consultants ``for thetime being,'' Unisys told The Washington Post for a story inSaturday's editions.   Unisys spokesman Bill Beckham said the consultants whosecontracts were terminated included Paisley and William Galvin, anassociate of Paisley who also is under investigation in the defenseprobe.   In Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner told Reichmann thatdisclosure of the detailed information in the affidavits wouldalert targets of the investigation and might encourage them todestroy documents.   But Reichmann sided with attorney Rex Heincke, representing theTimes, who said the wide publicity of the defense fraud probe makesthe sealing unnecessary because the investigation is no longersecret.   Reichmann said few Americans read newspapers or care about theoutcome of the defense probe, ``But this is about those few peoplewho care and who keep this country on its toes.''   Citizens are entitled to ask, ``are we just throwing our moneyaway when we buy these defense programs?'' he said.   Bonner also contended that the First Amendment right of accessapplies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted. Noone has been charged in the defense procurement investigation.   The only affidavit released in the case was unsealed earlierthis month in Dallas. But some of the less-detailed search warrantshave been released.</TEXT></DOC>
