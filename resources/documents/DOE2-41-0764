Theorginally amorphous phosphates formed preferentially whitlockite duringashing at 700/sup 0/C. In many samples talc was identified, which formerlynever had been found in mine dusts. The qualitative composition of thelymph node dusts corresponded with the lung dusts, also as to the phosphates.Quantitatively the lymph node dusts had generally higher portions ofquartz. This confirmes the lymphotropism of quartz. As a speciality crystalsof whitlockite were found within a SEM-image of a lymph node dust.</TEXT></DOC>
