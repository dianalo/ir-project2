Prices fell sharply in Tokyo, rose again in London and posted strong gains in Frankfurt.    The rebound in Frankfurt ended a three-session slump, during which prices fell about 13%.    In Tokyo, stocks plunged before staging a partial recovery in afternoon trading. The selling spree was initially sparked by the dollar's slump in the Tokyo currency markets Wednesday morning.    The Nikkei average of 225 stocks, which fell 731.91 points Tuesday, fell 649.70 on the day to close at 21036.76. The index hit an intraday low of 20513.65.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, stock prices continued to rebound. The Nikkei average advanced 229.52 to 21266.28 at the end of the morning session.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 48.99 to 1730.59 Wednesday. Turnover in the first section amounted to 600 million shares, double the previous day.    Wednesday's late recovery in share prices, traders said, capped a volatile day in which the Nikkei jumped up slightly at the morning open on the dollar's momentary strength in the currency markets, only to plunge more than 1000 points as the U.S. currency began to slip again in foreign exchange dealings.    Observers said late buying was apparently sparked by Japanese October trade figures, which showed that Japan's surplus with the U.S. narrowed slightly. Buying in export-led steel and paper and pulp shares surged as a result in the last minutes of trading.    Also noteworthy was the fact that sentiment was undercut by vague rumors that shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone were in trouble, as the NTT issue touched sharp intraday lows on the floor. Brokers said there were fears investors could begin to lose interest in the shares. NTT closed down 40,000 at 2.6 million yen a share.    The rumors surfaced despite reports in Tokyo that 60% to 70% of the new NTT shares sold on the basis of applications have been paid for.    Brokers indicated large securities companies apparently entered the market in the last half-hour of afternoon trading to keep the market barometer from closing below the crucial 21000.00 support level.    One observer said certain export-led electrical and other shares jumped up suddenly at the close. Sony rose 70 points to 3,930 ($29.17), Kyocera closed up 50 to 4,390, Hitachi rose 10 to 1,130, and NEC was up 20 to 1,800.    In steel, Tokyo Steel rose 70 to 3,150. Kawasaki Steel, however, dropped 5 to 315.    In London, shares rose for the second day in a row as investors sensed that the market has been oversold.    The Financial Times 30-share index rose 43.1 to 1290.0. The 100-share index gained 65.8 to 1639.3. It was the first time share prices rose on two consecutive days since the end of last month. Volume was 627.6 million shares, down slightly from 694.7 million shares Tuesday.    &quot;Things became a little too cheap,&quot; one broker said, adding that he saw some active buying of selective shares.    Another broker said the selling that has dragged the market down in the past few weeks dried up.    Brokers said the market's revival started at midday Tuesday, when General Cinema raised its stake in Cadbury Schweppes to 18% from 10%. Combined with other developments, the news raised hopes that companies will take advantage of lower share prices and resume takeover activity.    Brokers said Wednesday's rise was also helped by a number of strong earnings reports.    Among companies reporting better than expected earnings was British Airways, whose pretax profit in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 29%. Its shares ended up 19 pence at 144 ($2.54).    Ultramar's pretax profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose sharply, and the stock gained 17 to 167.    Among other oil shares, Shell moved up 15 to 965, and British Petroleum gained 4 to 251, while the partly paid new shares were unchanged at 77 pence.    Preliminary indications in Frankfurt, meanwhile, showed share prices were up more than 4%.    The dollar's rise in Europe after President Reagan said Tuesday he didn't want the U.S. currency to continue sliding buoyed investment in West German equities, brokers said.    Prices were also helped by bargain-hunting. The market went into a tailspin last week on fears that the dollar's decline to all-time lows against the mark would do considerable damage to the West German economy.    Bayerische Motoren Werke was among the strongest performers. The auto maker's stock rose 35 marks to 420 marks ($252) after the company reported that it would be profitable even with a much lower dollar.    Also in the auto sector, Daimler-Benz gained 13 to 603, and Volkswagen advanced 0.5 to 225.    Declining bank interest rates in the wake of last week's cut in the Lombard rate were boosting bank stocks. Investors hope that lower rates will spark loan demand while keeping refinancing costs low. Deutsche Bank was up 24 to 429.5, while Dresdner Bank gained 13.5 to 235.1. Commerzbank advanced 6 to 224.    Chemical issues were also brought higher. Steady dividends paid by the country's three big chemical producers make the sector rise in times of declining interest rates. Hoechst gained 12.3 to 240.3, while Bayer increased 8.8 to 256.8, and BASF rose 8 to 242.    Elsewhere in Europe, stocks closed higher in Zurich, Amsterdam and Milan, but fell in Stockholm. Markets in Paris and Brussels were closed for a holiday.    Shares closed lower in Sydney and Singapore and were mixed in Hong Kong.    In Sydney, the market's main index fell 4.5% to its lowest level in 15 months. All sectors eased. Many entrepreneurial-investment stocks were hurt by news their credit ratings were provisionally downgraded.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                  % This                            Nov 10     Nov 9       Year   U.S. ................... 224.0     227.7      - 1.8   Britain ................ 470.9     469.5      - 5.4   Canada ................. 319.5     326.3      - 4.1   Japan ................. 1052.3    1087.4      +11.4   France ................. 278.3     298.3      -31.8   Germany ................ 147.3     160.4      -43.3   Hong Kong ............. 1452.3    1520.4      -18.4   Switzerland ............ 138.6     146.5      -31.0   Australia .............. 232.0     242.0      -12.1   World index ............ 383.4     391.3      + 7.5</TEXT></DOC>
