Former Vernon Savings and Loan President Patrick G. King, aformer state trooper and once the state's second-ranking thriftregulator, was convicted Tuesday of charges including conspiracy andfraud.   King could receive 65 years in prison and fines up to $500,000 atsentencing Nov. 2.   ``Mr. King was an important kingpin in the savings and loanindustry,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.   ``His conviction sends a message that no matter how high up thecorporate ladder the wrongdoing was committed, it will not gounprosecuted.''   The government had charged King approved inflated expensevouchers and bogus bonus payments to reimburse employees forpolitical contributions in 1986 and thus circumvent campaigncontribution laws.   Some of the contributions went to House Speaker Jim Wright,D-Texas, Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,but prosecutors said the politicians were not aware where thecontributions came from.   In addition, King was accused of paying women recruited attopless bars to accompany Vernon officials and L. Linton Bowman III,head of the regulating Texas Savings and Loan Department, on twoout-of-state trips.   Testimony indicated King approved payments of $100 to $200 perwoman.   Vernon was shut down in 1987 by federal regulators in a $1.3billion bailout.   King was the first Vernon official to go to trial, althoughothers have pleaded guilty or been granted immunity for cooperationin the investigation of Vernon, often cited as one of the worstexamples of abuses in the industry.</TEXT></DOC>
