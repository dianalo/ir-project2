For fund companies, the very idea is an anathema. Theyhate to see shareholders bail out because it can cut intotheir profitability and, in the case of mass defections, caneven disrupt the way a mutual fund is managed.</LP><TEXT>   But fund analysts say that there are sometimes goodreasons to dump a fund. &quot;The old thing was to just buy andhold a mutual fund,&quot; says Kathleen Crowley, a vice presidentwith Chicago's Stratford Advisory Group. &quot;But today it'simportant for people to keep up with what's going on.&quot;   Investors sell mutual funds for a host of reasons. Theymay need cash to buy a house or pay for a child's education.Or they might switch into a more conservative fund as theygrow older and their investment goals change.   But, say fund analysts, there are other reasons to abandona mutual fund -- and these reasons have nothing to do with aninvestor's own finances. Instead, shareholders might want tojump ship because of events at the fund itself.   Probably the biggest reason for selling a fund is a changeof portfolio manager. These changes can be cruciallyimportant at stock funds and high-yield junk-bond funds,where investment returns vary widely depending on the skilland luck of the portfolio manager.   &quot;It's a real red flag when a fund manager leaves,&quot; saysKurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a SanFrancisco investment adviser. Mr. Brouwer suggests thatshareholders call their funds once a year to to make surethat the manager hasn't changed.   L/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter, usedto recommend stock funds such as Scudder Capital Growth,SteinRoe Special and Vanguard Trustees' CommingledInternational. But each of these funds had a change inportfolio manager, and that prompted the newsletter to dropthe funds from its recommended list.   Kenneth Gregory, the newsletter's editor, says a change infund manager isn't necessarily a sell signal. It all dependson whether the new manager has established a decent trackrecord by running another mutual fund or by managing privateaccounts. He also notes that investors will end up with a bigtax bill if they sell a fund in which they have hefty capitalgains.   Not all changes in the fund manager turn out badly. Lastyear saw a fistful of changes at Fidelity Investments, thecountry's largest mutual fund group. Peter Lynch retired asmanager of Fidelity Magellan Fund, and Bruce Johnstone leftFidelity Equity-Income to oversee the company's internationalmoney management. Those two departures set off a string ofother changes at the Boston fund group.   As it turns out, most of Fidelity's new fund managers haveoutpaced the average stock fund so far this year. &quot;It wouldhave been a terrible mistake to bail out,&quot; concludes WilliamHayes, a Fidelity senior vice president.   Even without a new manager, a fund's investment strategysometimes changes radically. Following the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait on Aug. 2, Brandywine Fund boosted its cash positionto more than 80%. The move troubled analysts, because it wassuch a dramatic departure from the fund's usual policy ofstaying fully invested in growth stocks.   Top fund managers typically generate good results bysticking with one investment style. Whenever a fund managerradically changes strategy, &quot;it's a danger sign,&quot; says DonPhillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago newsletter.   But on this occasion, the story ended well: Brandywineshifted back into stocks in January, just in time to catchthis year's stock market rally.   Another reason for selling a fund: poor performance. &quot;Idon't believe in dumping a fund if it has a bad year or twoand the manager has a good long-term record,&quot; says Mr.Gregory, the San Francisco newsletter editor. &quot;If you have a{bad} period as long as three years, it becomes a judgmentcall.&quot;   Mr. Gregory notes that investment styles go in and out offavor, which makes it difficult to analyze a fund manager'srecord. Value investors, for instance, look for stocks thatare cheap relative to assets or current earnings. Thatstrategy generated rotten results in 1989 and 1990. Butanybody who took that poor performance as a sell signal wouldhave missed out on this year's rebound by value managers.   So instead, Mr. Gregory advises investors to compare theirfund's performance with other funds that use a similarinvestment style. On that basis, he recently droppedEvergreen Fund from his list of recommended funds.   Evergreen has a stellar long-term record, but Mr. Gregorysays that over the past five years the fund has performedpoorly compared with the other conservative growth funds thathe tracks.   Stephen Lieber, Evergreen's fund manager, dismisses thefund's recent poor performance as a one-time hiccup, causedby the fund's large holdings of banks and thrifts in late1989 and early 1990. &quot;Otherwise our performance compared toour peers has been good,&quot; says Mr. Lieber.   Fund analysts also are leery of stock funds and junk-bondfunds that are too large or grow too quickly. StratfordAdvisory Group's Ms. Crowley says she would currently avoidfunds managed by Denver's Janus Capital, where assets undermanagement have ballooned to almost $5 billion from $1.2billion two years ago.   &quot;The Janus funds have excellent performance,&quot; says Ms.Crowley. &quot;But I'm very concerned about the growth.&quot;   Jack Thompson, an executive vice president with Janus,says the fund group is well aware that its rapid growth couldcreate problems. He notes that in the past two years the firmhas boosted its investment staff to 13 from four.   If the fund group's growth started to hurt performance,Mr. Thompson says the firm would be willing to close itsfunds to new investors. But so far, he says, the firm's rapidgrowth &quot;definitely hasn't affected returns.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
