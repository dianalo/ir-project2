Gesell today setJan. 31 as the starting date for the trial of former NationalSecurity Council aide Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.   Gesell's decision came at the end of an hour-long hearing inwhich one of North's lawyers, Barry Simon, pressed the judge to seta trial date.   Simon said the defense ``would like to get subpoenas out'' to anumber of people, including some in the Reagan administration whowill be leaving government next month ``for the four corners of theearth.''   ``We certainly hope we can meet that date,'' John Keker, who willhead the prosecution team appointed by independent counsel LawrenceWalsh, said after the hearing.   During the hearing, Keker revealed that the government is tryingto obtain notebooks which North compiled while he was the NSC.Portions of the notebooks were disclosed at congressional hearingslast year which looked into the sale of arms to Iran and thetransfer of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.   During the hearing, Simon, who has clashed repeatedly withGesell, complained that North's lawyers should be told whichportions are classified among some 30,000 pages of documents it hasin its possession. Simon has said the documents are relevant to thedefense of the former White House aide and that in some casesperhaps only a single word or sentence in a document of severalpages is classified.   Prosecutors said it would take several weeks to identify whichportions of all the documents are classified.   North's lawyers have until Jan. 3 to identify 300 classifieddocuments they plan to use at trial.   There are legal obstacles that could scuttle a trial of Northbefore it gets started, particularly the question of usingclassified documents.   Experts from the U.S. intelligence community are meeting withaides to Walsh in sessions dealing with deletions of sensitiveinformation from classified documents.   Gesell ruled Dec. 12 that too much material relevant to the casehad been excised from some classified documents Walsh wants to useas evidence at trial.   Material had been blacked out from portions of 300 classifieddocuments he is planning to use at trial. Gesell said that while thedocuments had all been properly classified, too much had been heldback, especially if a jury was to understand the facts of the case.   Gesell said that all references to eight countries involved inthe Iran-Contra affair must be restored and made public at trial.The countries included Israel, Iran and Nicaragua.   The judge also said that the text of information obtained byintelligence must for the most part be presented verbatim. He said,however, the methods and techniques used to obtain intelligencereports should remain secret.</TEXT></DOC>
