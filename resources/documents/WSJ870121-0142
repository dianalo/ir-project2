Malabre Jr. questions whether increases in deficit spending and increases in money supply can be effective in either preventing the economy from slipping into a recession or getting us out of a recession should we step into one.    While acknowledging that a recession is inevitable, the article does not detect a contraction phase to the business cycle in the foreseeable future.    Early work done by Wesley C. Mitchel and Arthur F. Burns on business cycles indicated that the &quot;seeds&quot; for the recession phase of the cycle were sown in the expansion phase but were usually invisible. One of the more significant seeds has usually been changes in future business expectations by business decision-makers. Since it is impossible to read the mind of every decision-maker, it has been empirically determined that significant changes in stock-market prices often lead changes in the economy by an average of 8.2 months.    Changes in current business expectations suggest that one might expect the next economic downturn to take place in the third quarter of 1987 and a significant downturn in the stock market well before that. However, because the world is awash with money, the market downturn will be neither severe nor long in duration. With both ample capital and strong currencies, such as in Japan and in Western Europe, American industry will continue to be gobbled up at unprecedented rates. American businesses -- in a politically free and safe environment, with undervalued assets, enormous growth potential and yielding the world's best return on investments -- are the investment bargains of the world. The Japanese can buy American undervalued assets today for 40% less than what they would have had to pay a year ago with a strong dollar.    From the business-cycle point of view, the stock market should drop sharply in early 1987 and stay down for a long period of time. However, from an asset point of view the market can be expected to recover sharply and continue to climb for a period of time until all the choice business jewels in America are either sold out or restructured.    The seeds for the economic downturn have already been sown and the best bet for when it will become visible is the latter part of 1987.
