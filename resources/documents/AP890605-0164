The justices said they will review the dispute even though Bushadministration lawyers, asked for their views, said a change infederal banking law may have made the case moot.   Continental Bank Corporation, based in Illinois, filed anapplication with the Florida Department of Banking an Finance in1981 to establish and run an industrial savings bank in Miami.   The proposed bank would not accept demand deposits or makecommercial loans _ making it a so-called ``non-bank bank'' thatfell outside the federal law's definition of banks.   But deposits in the proposed bank would be insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   The application was denied, and Continental subsequently sued infederal court. The suit alleged that Florida's denial of theapplication was unconstitutional.   Under federal banking law, a bank holding company based in onestate may not establish a bank in another state unless the latterstate's laws specifically authorize it to do so.   But because ``non-bank banks'' fall outside the scope of federalbanking law, state regulation of such institutions is subject tothe Constitution's requirement that states not unduly interferewith or discriminate against interstate commerce.   While the Continental case was pending before a federal appealscourt in 1987, federal banking law was amended to include in thedefinition of ``bank'' any institution the deposits of which areinsured by the FDIC.   Because the proposed industrial savings bank in Miami was to beFDIC-insured, it fell within the scope of federal banking law andsubject to Florida's legally authorized discrimination.   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, refused todeclare the case moot.   It instead ruled that the Florida law banning the industrialsavings bank was unconstitutional. The appeals court said it couldsay that the change in federal law would make Continental'soperation of the Florida institution ``banking'' activity ``inevery instance.''   Gerald A. Lewis, who heads the state Department of Banking andFinance, then sought Supreme Court review.   The case is Lewis vs. Continental Bank Corp., 87-1955.</TEXT></DOC>
