(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Peoria Journal Star popped the lid offTupperware's secret new product for 1990, and the plastickitchenware giant is steamed.   The newspaper reported Aug. 15 that Tupperware's ``revolutionarynew product line'' is a group of stackable microwave dishes.   ``The paper really did a number on us,'' said Alan Luce,Tupperware vice president for administration. ``This was a majorproduct breakthrough for us. It was not like a new tumbler orcolor. This was a major secret.''   The new line was to have been unveiled nationally Aug. 27. Butthe newspaper got a reporter inside a closed session of aTupperware convention Aug. 14 when the product was introduced to ajubilant crowd of dealers and sales managers.   Luce said the story ``ruined the fun, surprise and excitement''for conventioneers attending sessions later in the week in Peoria,Long Beach, Calif., and Orlando, Fla.   ``We've got 110,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the UnitedStates. We prefer that they know about our new products before thegeneral public knows,'' said Lawrie Pitcher Platt, spokeswoman atTupperware headquarters in Orlando.   Mayor Jim Maloof said his secretary received several calls fromupset Tupperware officials. He said he called the newspaper to askif the story could be pulled from its evening editions. The paperrefused.   ``I don't understand what's the big deal. They had news, and wewent and got it,'' said Jack Brimeyer, assistant managing editor.``We didn't treat them any differently than any other business ornews story.''   The mayor also said he had heard Tupperware had threatened tocancel its three-year contract to hold conventions in Peoria.   The company plans to hold its 1991 convention in Hawaii forTupperware's 40th anniversary, but Luce said that had nothing to dowith the Tupperware flap.   The new line is called Tupperwave. It's a nine-piece selectionof casserole-type dishes and accessories that can be stackedthree-high in a microwave to allow simultaneous cooking of entrees,side dishes and desserts.</TEXT><HEAD>First Soviet Newspapers Registered Under Freer Rules; But PricesRising</HEAD><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Newspapers have begun registering under new, freerpress regulations that replaced tough censorship.   All publications will be permitted except those urging theviolent overthrow of the government, promoting racial or religiousintolerance or publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty,according to the law.   None of the old or new national publications applying forregistration has been turned away, Dmitri Mamleyev, first deputychairman of the State Press Committee, told a news conference Aug.14.   The same day, the committee also announced a doubling in theprice of many publications, blaming increases in the cost of paper,printing equipment and transportation.   Some politicians have called the increases an attack onglasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for greateropenness.   The popular magazine Ogonyok, which now costs 40 kopecks at thenewstand, will rise to about 1 ruble _ more than double its price.The price of books also is expected to more than double, officialssaid.   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the largest Soviet republic,Russia, told speakers at a meeting in the northern Russian city ofVorkuta on Aug. 13 that the Soviet parliament had been too easy onthe Communications Ministry.   ``We should have taken it under control. ... We'll return to theissue and after that they will probably stop their attacks onglasnost,'' Yeltsin said in remarks reported by the Interfax newsagency, an arm of Radio Moscow.   Press committee officials in Moscow said the CommunicationsMinistry is billions of rubles in debt because of the increases inproduction costs.   They also said newstand prices could remain the same if theunions and other groups that publish periodicals were willing tosacrifice their profits to cover the increases.   More than 120 newspapers and other Soviet news organizationshave applied under the new press law, which was approvedunanimously by the Supreme Soviet in June after months of debateand took effect Aug. 1.
