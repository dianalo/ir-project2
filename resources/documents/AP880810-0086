Military officials declined to discuss details of the pulloutbut said the estimated 2,000 South African troops in Angola wouldwithdraw into South-West Africa by Sept. 1 in accordance with acease-fire agreement. South African units are as much as 180 milesinside Angola.   Military headquarters dismissed as ``ludicrous'' a Londonnewspaper report that several hundred of the soldiers had beentrapped behind enemy lines and faced death or capture prior to thetruce accord with Angola and Cuba.   Officials of the three countries are to meet in two weeks tonegotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cubantroops supporting Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year-old waragainst the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, orUNITA.   If agreement on Cuban withdrawal is reached, South Africa saysit will set Nov. 1 as the starting date for implementing a U.N.plan to end its 73-year rule over South-West Africa, also known asNamibia.   The U.N. plan envisions a 7,500-man U.N. peacekeeping force tobe deployed in Namibia for seven months while South African troopsgradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to drafta post-independence constituion.   Estimate of the cost of the U.N. operation have ranged as highas $1 billion.   If the implementation process begins Nov. 1, elections couldtake place as early as June 1, 1989.   Dirk Mudge, current chairman of Namibia's multiracial interimCabinet, said a constitution should be drafted before the elections.   Mudge suggested Namibian guerrillas, known as the South-WestAfrican People's Organization, should join with other Namibianpolitical parties in negotiating the framework of a constitutionprior to elections.   Mudge, at a news conference Tuesday, said he detected no signsof panic among white Namibians over the prospect of independence.He attributed this to changes in the territory over the pastdecade, including abolition of residential segregation andinstallation of a government in which six of eight Cabinetministers are black.   Moses Katjiuongua, minister of health and welfare, suggestedthat elections be held in Angola as well as Namibia.   ``Free and fair elections in Angola are long overdue,'' he said,endorsing UNITA's argument that Angola's Marxist leaders have neverreceived an electoral mandate since Angola's independence fromPortugal in 1975.   UNITA is not party to the cease-fire and says it will keepfighting until power-sharing talks take place.   In Namibia, most political experts believe the South-WestAfrican People's Organization will win a nationwide election. It isthe largest independence movement and its guerrilla wing has beenfighting South African rule since 1966.   South Africa's chief representative in Namibia, Louis Pienaar,has urged moderates and conservatives to form a common front tooppose the movement in the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
