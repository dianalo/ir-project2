The layoff, the second since April at the U.S. EnergyDepartment's Feed Materials Production Center, will include bothmanagement and production-line employees and could begin beforeChristmas, said Pete Kelley, a spokesman for the plant's operator,Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio.   Workers to be affected will be notified Dec. 9, he said.   Kelley said the layoffs have nothing to do with a strike by 625unionized production workers, which has idled the plant since Oct.7. Westinghouse Materials laid off 70 employees at the governmentplant in April because of declining orders for uranium and said thenthat another layoff was likely later this year.   ``They would have occurred anyway, because the production is downsubstantially for this fiscal year from last,'' Kelley said.   The plant's operating budget last year was $145 million but wascut to $107 million this year, he said.   Westinghouse Materials Co. said it will provide affectedemployees with job counseling, asistance with resume writing,interview skills training and a placement center.   The plant now employs about 1,500 people. It has supplied uraniumrecently for the Energy Department's Rocky Flats plant in Colorado,the Hanford reactors in Washington state, the Savannah River plantin South Carolina and the Oak Ridge, Tenn., nuclear complex. TheSavannah River reactors are shut down because of problems there, andthe Rocky Flats plant reportedly is under consideration for eventualclosure by the Energy Department.   The Fernald plant, located 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, hasbeen under heavy criticism in recent years. The Energy Departmentrecently admitted that the plant has released at least 300,000pounds of radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere during its 37years of operation.</TEXT></DOC>
