The company wouldn't elaborate on the differences that led Allan J. Hamilton, a regional partner, and eight of his associates, all in the commercial real estate division, to quit Wednesday night. But sources said the Chicago managers and executives in Dallas differed over, for example, the timing of new projects and disagreed about general corporate matters.    The resignations &quot;may slow us down&quot; in launching plans to penetrate the Canadian commercial real estate market, for which Chicago is responsible, said Joel Peterson, a managing partner for the large closely held real estate concern. The resignations aren't expected to affect the daily operations of the commercial real estate division, Mr. Peterson added.    Mr. Hamilton, 49 years old, had worked for Trammell Crow for nearly 20 years, all in Chicago. He couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. Company officials in Dallas and in suburban Itasca, Ill., where the Chicago office is located, said eight other managers, whom Mr. Hamilton had groomed, also quit. A company spokesman wouldn't disclose their names and positions.    The nine executives were responsible for site selections, building design and zoning development. The company said Robert Kresko, a managing partner in Chicago, will succeed Mr. Hamilton until a permanent replacement is found. The company had no immediate plans to fill the eight other vacancies.    Commercial real estate operations in many cities, including Chicago, have been battered by overbuilding and a vacancy rate that could, according to a recent Salomon Brothers Inc. study, reach 25% nationwide this year. But Trammell Crow officials asserted that their Chicago operations have been &quot;very successful.&quot;    In addition to commercial real estate, Trammell Crow, with total assets of more than $13 billion, owns and manages retail and residential real estate projects, as well as hotels, health care facilities and distribution centers in more than 100 cities. </TEXT></DOC>
