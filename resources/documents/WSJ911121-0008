The companies, both among the world's top 10 chip makers,will jointly design and develop products for sale in themid-1990s to late 1990s, and manufacture some of the chipstogether. The new 10-year pact goes beyond a 1988 agreementunder which the two companies have been exchanging basictechnologies.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement reflects the rapidly escalating costs ofmaking semiconductors and the difficulties even for hugeelectronics companies in working alone.   &quot;Technology advances require a huge cost, both in humanresources and equipment, to develop semiconductors, so it isbecoming necessary to share as much as possible,&quot; SachiakiNagae, president of Texas Instruments' Japan subsidiary, saidat a news conference.   Neither company would disclose the estimated cost ofdeveloping the chips, but according to industry estimates,costs double with each new generation. Texas Instruments hashad losses in recent quarters, and Hitachi, while highlyprofitable, has seen its earnings decline, largely because ofthe weak semiconductor market.   Their joint development work is only the latest effort bythe two companies to spread the worsening burden of chipmaking. Both companies have sought other partners to makememory chips for them in Japan and South Korea, and TexasInstruments also has tie-ups with Taiwanese and Italiancompanies.   Nor are Hitachi and Texas Instruments alone. Toshiba Corp.and Motorola Inc. have a joint venture in Japan tomanufacture memory and logic semiconductors. NEC Corp. andAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp. recently agreed to swapbasic chip-making technologies.   The latest agreement between Texas Instruments and Hitachicovers development of dynamic random-access memories, orDRAMs, that can store up to 64 megabits, or 64 millionpieces, of information. The companies said they will developtogether a common design and manufacturing processes for thechips, which will shrink the space between the wiring on thechips to only 0.35 microns, or 0.0035 millimeters, littlemore than half the smallest space currently used in massproduction.   The work will be done in Japan by various teams made up ofHitachi and Texas Instruments workers. The two companies alsowill do the early, low-volume production together, but willhandle mass production and marketing separately.   The companies portray the 1988 arrangement, which covers16-megabit chips, as mainly a &quot;technical informationexchange.&quot; For both the 16-megabit and 64-megabit DRAMs, forexample, the two companies developed common packaging as wellas technology to evaluate chip quality.   But the two companies use radically different structuresfor the 16-megabit DRAM design. For 64-megabit DRAMs, theywill use the same design. Also, they will use the same designautomation, develop common processing technology and have ajoint design team -- steps they aren't using for 16-megabitchips.   As part of the agreement, Hitachi also will take out alicense on Texas Instruments' so-called Kilby patent, whichthe U.S. company says covers all basic chip designs. TexasInstruments was granted the patent in Japan two years ago,nearly three decades after the initial application. Earlierthis year, Fujitsu Ltd. decided to challenge the patent incourt.   Texas Instruments and Hitachi also extended by three yearstheir cooperative agreement on the 16-megabit chip.</TEXT></DOC>
