The Defense Department said the four MPs were on ``officialduty'' at the time of their arrest in strife-torn Panama City andwere arrested without cause and held incognito.   They were released late Thursday night, but Panamanianauthorities continued Friday to hold their cars, sidearms and flakjackets, the Pentagon added.   ``Three members of the U.S. Army South's Military Police Commandand one member of the Oklahoma National Guard were arrested atapproximately 2:30 p.m. Thursday while on official business in thevicinity of the Hilton Park Hotel in Panama City,'' the DefenseDepartment said in a statement.   ``The four were detained at Panama Defense Forces facilities forseveral hours before being released into the custody of U.S.military authorities at approximately 11 p.m. The soldiers were incivilian clothes and were checking on the security of U.S. militaryfamilies in government-leased quarters in the area who are affectedby the lack of electrical, water and telephone service in parts ofPanama City.''   The government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, meanwhile,declared a national ``state of urgency'' Friday that allows it tosuspend individual freedoms. A decree said the action was takenbecause of ``a real situaion of undeclared war against the republicof Panama'' by the United States and the domestic politicalopposition.   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the oneNational Guardsman was a member of the 745th MP Company who was onannual training in Panama with the U.S. Army South.   The spokeswoman added the four were authorized to carry weaponsbeneath their civilian clothes and were carrying credentials thatshould have been honored. Under the terms of the Panama CanalTreaty, U.S. military authorities also should have been notified ofthe MPs' arrest, she said.   ``U.S. military authorities were not notified of the arrest byPanama Defense Forces,'' LaLuntas said. ``And during their 8{ hoursof being detained, the arrested soldiers asked repeatedly forpermission to notify U.S. military authorities of their situation,and their requests were denied.   ``The soldiers were also verbally abused (and) made to stand forlong periods of time...,'' she said.   The Pentagon identified the four as Pvt. 1st Class TammyMarkley; Pvt. 1st Class Richard Virts; Specialist 4 Jerry Williams,and Staff Sgt. Danny Felton, the National Guardsman. The ages andhometowns of the four were not available.   The Pentagon statement was issued following a report in aPanamanian newspaper Friday. The newspaper Critica said the fourAmericans were arrested ``in an area where daily activitiesdisturbing the public order'' had taken place.   It said the four were carrying handguns, maps of the city and``other military implements.''   Panama was hit by power outages this week as electric companyworkers joined continuing protests against the government ofmilitary ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   On Wednesday the U.S. Southern Command placed the 10,000American troops and their dependents stationed in Panama on thehighest alert status when Panama's police chief, Col. LeonidasMacias, led an unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega.</TEXT></DOC>
