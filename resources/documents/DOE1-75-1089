Electrical demand continues to grow andwill increasingly rely on coal and nuclear fuels. The nuclear power industrystill has not found a solution to the problem of disposing of the wasteproduced by nuclear reactors. Although coal is in ample supply and theinfrastructure is in place for its utilization, environmental problemsand improved conversion processes remain technical challenges. In thecase of transportation, the nation depends almost exclusively on liquidfuels with attendant reliance on imported oil. Economic alternates---synfuelsfrom coal, natural gas, and oil shale, or fuel cells and batteries---haveyet to be developed or perfected so as to impact the marketplace. Inefficienciesin energy conversion in almost all phases of resource utilization remain.These collective problems are the focus of the Energy Program. In thisreport, the individual programs making up the Energy Program are groupedinto three sections: Nuclear Energy, Fossil Energy, and Nonfossil Energy.Nonfossil Energy research includes work on the aluminum-air fuel cell,geothermal research, combustion chemistry, and abrasion studies relatingto energy conversion processes and fuel transportation. Throughout thisreport, the individual programs are first described in terms of theirobjectives and accomplishments, and then publications reporting on theyear's progress are listed.</TEXT></DOC>
