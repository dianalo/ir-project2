Gunakara is a combination of two Sanskrit wordsthat roughly translates to 'intelligent action.'andP;  The fullblown Prographpackage includes an editor, interpreter and a recently completed compiler.andM;In neighboring New Brunswick, Comtec Data Services is busy beta-testing anatural language package aimed at students and inmates who want to know moreabout AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).andP;  &quot;The idea is toapproximate as closely as possible, with a computer, a conversation one wouldhave with another human being,&quot; says marketing manager Ian MacMillan.andM;At the University of New Brunswick (UNB), Computer Science has become afull-fledged faculty.andM;&quot;To go from nothing to a full faculty in 21 years is quite amazing,&quot; saysCompSci dean Dr. Dana Wasson.andP;  &quot;I don't think I expected that when we startedour Masters program in 1968.&quot;andM;Among the research programs at UNB are efforts to improve ocean-bottommapping that will allow preliminary processing on-site using high-poweredworkstations and a computerized tool to help children learn how to manipulateartificial limbs.andM;Also at UNB, this time in the forestry faculty, is the completion of asoftware tool to graphically display statistical data generated for themanagement of woodlots.andM;Students Erin Baskent, who developed the graphics model, and Kanjana Nitaya,who created the user interface, worked on the project for two years inconjunction with the provincial government and J.D.andP;  Irving Ltd., the largestforest products company in New Brunswick.andM;On the hardware side, is GOC Electronics of Oromocto, N.B., tucked in thewoods near the TransCanada Highway.andP;  Company president Jim Sutherland saysthe company is busy converting to surface mount technology for motherboardsand its primary products, multi-function boards for PCs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
