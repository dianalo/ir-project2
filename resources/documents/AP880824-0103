Review-Journal on the homeless:   Jesse Jackson's out on the campaign trail trying to beat theReagan administration over the head with the homeless issue, whichJackson blames on the heartless ``economic violence'' of theaforementioned administration.   Jackson contends in his speeches there are ``5 to 10 millionhomeless'' people roaming the streets of the United States. Wherehe gets that figure is a mystery. Someone ought to ask him.   Michael Dukakis talks about the ``3 to 5 million homeless'' inthe United States. Is Dukakis using different sources for hisinformation than Jackson? We doubt it. They are both guessing,that's all.   A Harvard University demographic analysis estimated the nationalhomeless population at 279,000. ... The Census Bureau estimates nomore than 400,000 nationwide.   All this is to say that before we go making massivetax-supported ``investments'' in big-scale, low-income housingprojects, as Jackson would have us do, let's first find out howserious the problem of homelessness is.   Maybe with reliable figures _ not wild guesses _ we canformulate a rational policy.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 23   Des Moines (Iowa) Register on Dan Quayle and his National Guardservice:   If he remains on the GOP ticket, Dan Quayle will be adistraction from the issues throughout the campaign for thepresidency. George Bush should replace him as his running mate. ...   In trying to reach out to the baby-boom generation, Bush failedto discern how his choice of a running mate would dredge up one ofthat generation's most terrible memories.   It is the memory of how the Vietnam War was fought by the poor,the black, the blue collar, while young men from better-offfamilies generally managed to avoid combat duty.   J. Danforth Quayle III, although he came of age at the height ofthe war, stayed home in the Indiana National Guard.   There's nothing wrong with National Guard service, but inQuayle's case it has the appearance of hypocrisy because hispolitical record is that of a military hawk.   And it reeks of special privilege because his wealthy family hadconnections that eased his way into the guard. ...   The best thing Bush could do would be to ask his running mate towithdraw.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 19   Rochester (Minn.) Post-Bulletin on George Bush's acceptancespeech:   If a strong acceptance speech was crucial to George Bush'scandidacy, he met the challenge Thursday night.   In accepting the nomination of the Republican Party, Bushrestated the themes of the Reagan administration, but also wentbeyond them.   In addition to the expected conservative issues _ such asopposition to gun control and abortion and support for capitalpunishment _ he gave special emphasis to protecting the environmentand to the problems of low-income families. ...   Bush clearly feels that he is now out of the shadow of PresidentReagan and is free to chart his own course and to give free rein tohis own personality. ...   Bush's performance Thursday night showed that he is bettersuited for the contest than his critics had believed.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 22   The Miami Herald on the need for prenatal care for the poor:   Chalk up one more tragedy caused by crack cocaine, one moretragedy complicated by the nation's _ and Florida's _ failure toprovide adequate prenatal care to its poor.   The tragedy is the horrific increase in babies born in Floridawith syphilis.   Last year, 110 babies were born with the disease. In the firsthalf of this year, that total soared to 120 (91 of those in SouthFlorida). ...   The price of undelivered prenatal care is high, and higher stillfor babies of the poor.   While clinic care costs about $600, intensive care for babiesborn too early or too small can range to $100,000. For babies borndamaged, that bill is just a down payment on a lifetime of specialneeds.   That, and the loss of a potentially productive citizen is thebill society pays for its neglect.   Parents pay for their neglect with their guilt and tears. But itis the babies who pay the dearest price: their health and eventheir lives.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 20   Milwaukee (Wis.) Sentinel on cooling the legislative hot air:   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, that disciple of budgetary restraint andcost controls, surrendered unconditionally to nature and droppedhis opposition to air conditioning in the State Captiol. ...   It's going to cost anywhere from $4.5 million to $12 million.   Long overdue, considering this summer's miseries, and complaintsin years past? Yes.   But hot air is not common to nature alone. It tends to emanatefrom beneath the closed doors of party caucuses and waft acrosslegislative chambers in the heat of debate.   No amount of money can stop that.</TEXT></DOC>
