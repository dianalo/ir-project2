The comment period, which was 60 days from the date of publication,ended on September 20, 1988. Comments were received from 16 agencies, oneexecutive organization, and one member of Congress.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Qualifications Standards</ITAG>One agency recommended that andSection; 317.402(a) not require that a qualificationsstandard identify the ``breadth and depth'' of the knowledges, skills,and abilities required for successful performance on the basis that sucha requirement is more appropriate to developing a crediting plan. We haveretained this provision since the standard sets out the ``breadth and depth''of the qualifications factors, and the crediting plan then shows how tomeasure these factors.One agency recommended that andSection; 317.402(b), which states that thestandard must be specific enough to enable applicants to be rated and rankedaccording to their degree of qualifications, be deleted to avoid confusingexamination factors with qualfications factors. We do not believe thisprovision will cause confusion. The standard has to be specific enoughso that a crediting or examining plan can be developed by the agency thatwill make qualitative distinctions among the applicants for ranking purposes.One agency recommended deletion of the provision in andSection; 317.402(d)(1)that a standard may not contain a minimum length of experience requirement.The agency argued that such a requirement may be useful in predicting successfulperformance in certain situations. We have revised the provision to allowagencies to use a minimum length of experience requirement if they believeit is appropriate, but the requirement may not exceed that for a similarposition in the General Schedule.One agency recommended deletion of andSection; 317.404, which provides thatagencies have to keep copies of old qualifications standards for 2 years.The provision has been retained to assure that adequate documentation existsin case a question is raised or an audit is conducted.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Career Appointments</ITAG>(1) Recruitment and Selection of Initial SES Career AppointmentOne agency recommended that andSection; 317.501(a) be revised to state thatthe agency Executive Research Board (ERB) will ``oversee'' rather than``conduct'' the merit staffing process for career appointees so as to indicatethat the ERB has authority to delegate its functions. The term ``conduct''is used in 5 U.S.C. 3393(b) and therefore is retained. The authority ofthe ERB to delegate certain of its functions is specified in andSection;317.501(c)(2).Two agencies objected to the provision in andSection; 317.501(b)(2) thatagencies must list in OPM's biweekly publication of SES vacancies any vacancythey intended to fill by career appointment. One of the agencies statedthat there may be occasions when an expedited announcement is required.The provision has been retained to assure that notice of all SES vacanciesis made available as a minimum to all groups of qualified individuals withinthe civil service, as required by 5 U.S.C. 3393(a), and that notice ofSES vacancies open to individuals outside the civil service is made availableto the U.S. Employment Service, as required by 5 U.S.C. 3327. The provisionhas been clarified, however, to indicate agencies only have to list thosevacancies which are being filled by initial career appointment to the SES.Positions being filled by reassignment, transfer, or reinstatement of careerSES appointees do not have to be listed. The minimum period of listingis 14 calendar days, which should still allow agencies to expedite thefilling of their jobs when necessary.One agency commented that under andSection; 317.501(c)(1) all candidatesresponding to a vacancy announcement would have to be rated and rankedon the same basis. It recommended that the rating and ranking of currentcareer SES members and reinstatement eligibles should be at the optionof the agency since competitive requirements for entry into the SES havealready been met and these individuals could be placed noncompetitively.We agree, and the regulations have been revised accordingly.One agency objected to the provision in andSection; 317.501(c)(2) that theERB is required to consider the qualifications only of those candidateswho meet the requirements of the vacancy announcement (i.e., are withinthe area of consideration and meet the minimum qualifications requirements.)The agency noted that 5 U.S.C. 3393(b) provides that the ERB is responsiblefor ``reviewing the executive qualifications of each candidate * * *.''We do not believe it was the intent of the law to prohibit the ERB fromusing subject matter specialists to screen out unqualified candidates beforethe ERB considered the candidates, and the provision has been retained.One agency recommended that in andSection; 317.502(c)(5) the ERB not be requiredto provide written recommendations to the appointing authority on all eligiblecandidates, but be allowed instead to provide a statement that it had reviewedthe applications of the eligible candidates and was referring ``X'' numberfor selection consideration. This section implements 5 U.S.C. 3393(b)(2),which states that the ERB is responsible for ``making written recommendationsto the appropriate appointing authority concerning such candidates.'' Webelieve that the intent of the law is that the appointing authority bemade aware of the ERB determinations on all the eligible candidates, andtherefore the provision has been retained.One agency commented that in andSection; 317.502(c)(5) it appears that ratingsheets could be used to satisfy the requirement that written recommendationsbe provided by the ERB to the appointing authority only when there wasa large number of candidates. The section has been clarified to state thatrating sheets may be used at any time. The section has also been revisedto indicate that although rating sheets may be used for the written recommendationon individual candidates, the ERB still has to certify in writing the listof candidates provided to the appointing authority.Two agencies objected to the provision in andSection; 317.501(c)(6) thatthe appointing authority certify that appropriate merit staffing procedureswere followed. They both noted that the ERB is charged by law with conductingthe merit staffing process and recommended that the ERB be allowed to makethe certification. The provision has been revised to allow either the appointingauthority or the ERB to make the certification (andSection; 317.501(c)(7)).(2) Qualifications Review Board (QRB) CertificationOne agency objected to the provision in andSection; 317.502(b) that agenciesmust submit their case to a QRB within 9 months of the closing date ofa vacancy announcement or the completion of an OPM approved SES candidatedevelopment program. It noted that the provision removed any flexibilityfor OPM to waive the requirement in extreme circumstances. We agree andhave revised the section to state that OPM may set the length of time duringwhich a case must be received, and we will provide the length in the <T3>Federal Personnel Manual. </T3>In the meantime, the 9-month limitationwill be applicable unless OPM provides a waiver in a specific case forgood cause.One agency recommended that andSection; 317.502(c) be revised to providethat QRB certifications, including those for graduates of SES candidatedevelopment programs, will be good for 5 years rather than 3 years. Theprovision has been retained to assure that the qualifications are sufficientlyrecent.Five agencies objected to andSection; 317.502(d), which provides that OPMmay determine the disposition of agency QRB cases between the time an agencyhead leaves office and the time a new agency head is confirmed and appointed.One agency stated that action should not be taken by OPM without consultingthe agency. One agency stated that it might be appropriate to return thefew cases involving positions reporting directly to the agency head, butnot other cases. One agency stated that although such a provision mightbe appropriate during a Presidential transition, it would not be appropriateat other times. Two agencies stated that the provision would not be appropriateat any time. Generally, the attitude of the agencies responding was, asstated by one agency, that the provision was ``an unwarranted intrusioninto an agency's management of its SES resources.''When we issued the proposed regulations, we stated that this authoritywas needed to assure that the new agency head will be able to make hisor her own selections for key positions. We still hold this view and thereforehave retained the provision. As we also pointed out when we issued theproposed regulations, however, cases will not be automatically returnedto agencies. We stated then that OPM may return cases to agencies, holdthem pending appointment of a new agency head, or submit them for QRB reviewdepending on the circumstances, such as the organizational level of theposition being filled, the degree to which the imcumbent would be involvedin policy matters, and how long before a new agency head is likely to takeoffice. Criteria will be included in the <T3>Federal Personnel Manual, </T3>and we will consult with agencies whenpossible before making a decision on what to do in an individual case.(3) Probationary PeriodSection 317.503(d) of the proposed regulations provided that if a careerappointee left the SES before completing the probationary period, the appointeeneed not be recertified by a QRB if selected for another SES position within3 years of the previous QRB certification. The section has been clarifiedto indicate that recertification is required if the individual was removedfrom the SES for performance or disciplinary reasons.One agency recommended that the regulations also state that once an SESmember completes an SES probationary period, the member need not receiveQRB certification to enter another SES position following a break in SESservice. We do not believe this statement is necessary in the regulationssince the QRB is responsible only for review of initial career appointments,but will make clear in the <T3>Federal Personnel Manual </T3>that QRB action is not required for anindividual who completed the probationary period and is reinstated to theSES.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart G_Reinstatement</ITAG>Section 317.702(a)(2) lists separation actions following which a careerappointee is not eligible for reinstatement to the SES. The Office of SpecialCounsel, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), provided clarifying language,which we have adopted, regarding removals directed by the MSPB resultingfrom disciplinary actions initiated by the Special Counsel.Section 317.703 covers reinstatement of former career appointees who havetaken Presidential appointments. One agency recommended that andSection;317.703(b), which provides that a Presidential appointee may apply to OPMfor directed reinstatement only after the appointee's resignation is requestedor submitted, be amended to allow application also when the resignationis ``projected.'' We have not adopted the recommendation because OPM needsto know definitely that a resignation is to occur before directing reinstatementin the SES, which may occur in another agency. Once a resignation is requestedor submitted, however, OPM will initiate action even though the effectivedate of the resignation is not until later.One agency recommended that andSection; 317.703(c)(2), which states the agencyorder of precedence in directing reinstatement, be revised to provide thateach precedence-ordered group of agencies be used only if it is not possibleto place the Presidential appointee in an agency in any higher rankinggroup. Although OPM will attempt to follow the order of precedence wheneverpossible, we want to maintain sufficient flexibility to assure the mostappropriate placement. Therefore, we have not changed the provision.One agency recommended that andSection; 317.703(c)(5), which provides thatan agency may place a Presidential appointee on a limited term appointmentpending reinstatement to avoid a break in service, be revised to providethat a limited emergency appointment may be used instead, particularlysince most appointments will be of a short term nature. We have revisedthe section to allow use of either a limited term or emergency appointment,as appropriate, for this purpose.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart I_Reassignments, Transfers, and Details</ITAG>(1) ReassignmentsTwo sets of comments were received on andSection; 317.901(c), concerningthe 120-day moratorium on the involuntary reassignment of a career appointeefollowing the appointment of a new agency head or the appointee's mostimmediate noncareer supervisor who has the authority to reassign the appointee.One of the comments was from the Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee onCivil Service. The other comment was from an executive organization.Both comments disagreed with the interpretation expressed in the SupplementaryInformation portion of the proposed regulations that although a noncareersupervisor could not personally involuntarily reassign any subordinatecareer appointee during the 120 days following appointment, the appointeecould be reassigned by the agency head during that period if the agencyhead had been in office 120 days. The commenters contended that the purposeof the moratorium was to allow the noncareer supervisor to become familiarwith the talents of career subordinates prior to their being reassigned,but that under the OPM interpretation the supervisor could just requestthe agency head to take the action during the period the supervisor wassubject to the moratorium.It should be noted that under 5 U.S.C. 3359(e)(1), the moratorium is onlyapplicable to a noncareer supervisor who ``has the authority to reassignthe career appointee.'' If the agency head has retained the reassignmentauthority for all career appointees in the agency, it is clear that theagency head could reassign any career appointee once the agency head hadbeen in office for 120 days even if the noncareer supervisor of the appointeehas not served 120 days. Therefore, the only matter at issue is whetherwhen the reassignment authority had been delegated by the agency head tothe noncareer supervisor, the agency head may reclaim that authority anddirect an involuntary reassignment before the noncareer supervisor hasserved 120 days.The interpretation stated in the proposed regulations is one that OPM hasmade since 1979. We do not believe that Congress intended to pyramid moratoriumperiods. Under the interpretation proposed by the commenters, the moratoriumcould last for 240 days if the noncareer supervisor was appointed justas the 120-day moratorium on the agency head was ending. A new agency headoften brings in his or her own top subordinates. If each time a noncareersupervisor who had reassignment authority changed, a new 120-day moratoriumwas initiated that also applied to the agency head, there could be an exceedinglylong time before reassignments could be effected and the agency head couldexercise control over the agency. We do not believe that the agency headwill automatically honor every request from a noncareer supervisor sincethe agency head will be looking at the situation from the perspective ofthe whole agency and often will have had the opportunity personally toobserve the appointee.Therefore, it continues to be OPM's interpretation that the moratoriumis not applicable to the agency head once the agency head has been in office120 days if the agency head is the actual decision maker for the reassignment.The executive organization also contended that details are used to circumventthe moratorium on involuntary reassignments and urged that details of careerappointees be prohibited during the moratorium period, unless the detailwas agreed to in writing, or that time spent on detail not count againstthe moratorium period. There is no statutory prohibition on the use ofdetails during the moratorium period. While reassignment is a permanentchange of positions, a detail is temporary; and the individual continuesto occupy the position from which detailed. OPM is as concerned as theexecutive organization that details not be used improperly. Agency management,however, must have the flexibility to accomplish the work of the agency;and there may be times when a detail is necessary for this purpose duringthe moratorium period. Therefore, we have not adopted the recommendation.Agencies are cautioned, however, that any detail during the moratoriumperiod should be made judiciously and only when there is a bona fide needfor the individual to serve temporarily in the position. It should be notedthat career SES members have recourse to the Special Counsel of the MeritSystems Protection Board if they believe a detail has been used improperlyto circumvent the 120-day moratorium period.(2) TransfersTwo agencies recommended that andSection; 317.902(b), which states that transfersmay not occur without the appointee's consent except in a transfer of function,should be amended to indicate that the gaining agency must also consent.The section has been revised accordingly.One agency recommended that andSection; 317.902(a) also be amended to statethat a transfer between major components of the Department of Defense (e.g.,between the Departments of Army and Navy or between the Office of the Secretaryof Defense and the Department of Navy) need not be voluntary if specificallydirected by the Secretary of Defense. The agency noted that 10 U.S.C. 113(b)provides that the Secretary ``has authority, direction, and control overthe Department of Defense.'' This matter pertains to only one Departmentand is based on statutory provisions outside title 5 of the U.S. Code,for which OPM is responsible. Therefore, rather than amending the regulations,we will put an explanatory statement in the Federal Personnel Manual discussionof this provision that it is not intended to restrict the statutory authorityof the Secretary of Defense under title 10 of the U.S. Code in the matterof transfers between major components of the Department specifically directedby the Secretary.(3) DetailsSeveral agencies commented on the provision in andSection; 317.903(b) thatstates OPM may set limits on the total length of details and the lengthof details that may be made without competition. Two agencies opposed allowingOPM to set any limits. One agency recommended that the current 240-daylimitation, without prior OPM approval, of a General Schedule or competitiveservice employee to an SES position (FPM Letter 300-32) be changed to oneyear. One agency recommended setting limits only when an individual isbeing detailed from a non-SES position to an SES position. One agency recommendedthat in using competitive procedures, agencies not be bound by the competitivepromotion requirements in FPM Chapter 335.The authority of OPM to place limitations on details has been retainedto ensure that details which extend a significant period of time are usedproperly. The section has been revised to make clear that the limitationsintended are not on the overall length of details, but on the length thatmay be made without the prior approval of OPM. The section has also beenrevised to indicate that the limitation on details without competitionapplies only to details from outside the SES. The specific limitationswill be set out in the <T3>Federal Personnel Manual.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart J_Corrective Action</ITAG>One agency recommended that andSection; 317.1001 be revised to state thatwhen OPM finds that an agency has taken an action contrary to law or regulation,``it may require the agency to take appropriate corrective action'' ratherthan ``whatever corrective action OPM deems necessary.'' The recommendationhas been adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it deals with the SESof the executive branch of the Federal Government.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 317</ITAG>Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR Part 317 by revising the authority citationfor the part and removing the authority citation for Subpart G; addingSubpart D, andSection;andSection; 317.401 through 317.404; adding Subpart E,andSection;andSection; 317.501 through 317.503; revising Subpart G, andSection;andSection;317.701 through 317.703; adding Subpart I, andSection;andSection; 317.901 through317.904; and adding Subpart J, andSection; 317.1001, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 317_APPOINTMENT, REASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, AND REINSTATEMENT INTHE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Qualifications Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.401 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.402 Career reserved positions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.403 General positions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.404 Retention of qualifications standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Career Appointments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.501 Recruitment and selection for initial SES career appointment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.502 Qualifications Review Board certification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.503 Probationary period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_SES Career Appointment by Reinstatement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.701 Agency authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.702 General reinstatement: SES career appointees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.703 Guaranteed reinstatement: Presidential appointees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart I_Reassignments, Transfers, and Details</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.901 Reassignments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.902 Transfers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.903 Details.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.904 Change in type of SES appointment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart J_Corrective Action</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">317.1001 OPM authority for corrective action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 5 U.S.C. 3392, 3393, 3395, 3397, 3593, and 3595.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Qualifications Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 317.401</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>The head of each agency is responsible for establishing qualificationsstandards for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions in accordance withthe procedures described in this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 317.402</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Career reserved positions.</ITAG>(a) The qualifications standard must be in writing and identify the breadthand depth of the professional/technical and executive/managerial knowledges,skills, and abilities, or other qualifications, required for successfulperformance in the position.(b) The standard must be specific enough to enable applicants to be ratedand ranked according to their degree of qualifications when the positionis being filled on a competitive basis.(c) Each qualifications criterion in the standard must be job related.The standard may not emphasize agency-related experience, however, to theextent that it precludes otherwise well-qualified condidates from outsidethe agency from appointment consideration.(d) The standard may not include_(1) A minimum length of experience requirement beyond that authorized forsimilar positions in the General Schedule;(2) A minimum education requirement beyond that authorized for similarpositions in the General Schedule; or(3) Any criterion prohibited by law or regulation.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 317.403</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General positions.</ITAG>An agency may apply the criteria in andSection; 317.402 when developing qualificationsstandards for general positions.
