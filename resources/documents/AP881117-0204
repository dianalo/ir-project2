(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. Bankruptcy judge on Thursdayrejected two offers for the PTL ministry, ordered bidding to ``startfrom scratch'' and said he'd liquidate the evangelical empire if thesale is not completed by Dec. 13.   ``It's either then or nothing,'' Judge Rufus Reynolds said.   The judge directed PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton todraft guidelines for prospective buyers that incorporate certainconditions he previously set forth.   The auction Thursday between two Canadian businessmen wasexpected to close the books on the ministry that Jim and TammyBakker built before a sex-and-money scandal forced it to seekChapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors.   The judge, however, said he had decided to ``turn all of themdown and to start from scratch.''   Bidding in the December auction will begin at $50 million to $60million, Benton said, adding he expected one or two more bidders toappear.   Reynolds scheduled another auction for Dec. 12 and said he wouldapprove a buyer the next day, warning that if the case is notconcluded by then, ``I will not put up with this case any longerunder (Chapter) 11. I will move it to Chapter 7.''   Under Chapter 7, the doors would be closed and the court wouldproceed to a straight liquidation.   In either case the sale proceeds would be applied to theministry's debts, which could reach $130 million.   Reynolds said he preferred Chapter 11 because Chapter 7 ``doesn'tbring the most money to the most people.''   Some creditors have pushed for immediate liquidation, citing thecosts of keeping the facility running. Reynolds said PTL is losing$300,000 to $400,000 a month.   Vancouver real estate magnate Peter Thomas, 50, opened thebidding Thursday with a $70 million cash offer that allowed him toback out of the deal within a certain time after closing _ aprovision Reynolds objected to.   Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick, a 34-year-old real estatedeveloper who is an Orthodox Jew, then bid $115 million with a $50million initial payment, but Reynolds objected that there wereinadequate assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65million.   Both Mernick and Thomas said they would consider theiralternatives before deciding whether to continue bidding.   PTL has been operating since last summer as a non-profitcorporation known as Heritage Ministries, Inc.   The remaining for-profit organization, including the theme park,hotel and shopping mall at the Heritage USA complex at Fort Mill and1,700 undeveloped acres nearby, have been under the bankruptcycourt's control pending its sale.   With the proposed sale of assets, PTL as an entity would cease toexist, leaving behind only Heritage Ministries, Inc.   Australian businessman Gavin Morehu; Charlotte, N.C., businessmanGeorge Shinn; and Bakker all have said they wanted to buy the site,then faded from view. Bakker fell from the bidding earlier this fallwhen he was unable to raise a $3 million down payment. The Bakkersnow are trying to raise money for a new TV ministry.   The effort to sell PTL has dragged on since Reynolds withdrew anearlier deadline of Oct. 1 at Benton's request for more time.   PTL filed for bankruptcy protection in 1987, three months afterBakker stepped aside over a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, achurch secretary.   Donations to the ministry dwindled amid ensuing revelations aboutthe luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the Bakkers.</TEXT></DOC>
