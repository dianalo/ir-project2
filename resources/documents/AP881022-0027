But supporters, including distinguished judges, hailed theannouncement Thursday by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgovernment as a sensible, long overdue move that will mean fewerterrorists go free.   Either way, Mrs. Thatcher's government is prepared to dump theBritish equivalent of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. TheFifth Amendment holds that no person ``shall be compelled in anycriminal case to be a witness against himself ... without dueprocess of law.''   New laws, expected to be passed for Northern Ireland by Januaryand for England and Wales by 1990, will allow a judge or jury todeduce, if they wish, that a suspect's refusal to answer policequestions after arrest is an indication of guilt.   At present, courts are not allowed to take into consideration asuspect's silence _ under laws dating from the 17th century anddesigned to protect illiterate suspects from unfairly or wronglyincriminating themselves.   But government officials note times have changed.   In Northern Ireland, where the law is aimed mainly at the IrishRepublican Army, police find guerrilla suspects well-trained in howto sit it out: staring at a wall through days of interrogation,sitting with their heads between their legs to avoid eye contactwith interrogators, or lying under a table.   Elsewhere, In the United Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher's officialsargue, regular criminals, particularly sophisticated racketeers anddrug dealers, are similarly expert.   ``Is it really in the interests of justice that experiencedcriminals should be able to refuse to answer all police questionssecure in the knowledge that a jury will never hear of it?'' saidHome Secretary Douglas Hurd.   In Northern Ireland, Republican News, the newspaper of theoutlawed IRA's legal political front, Sinn Fein, advises arrestedguerrillas: ``Interrogation _ Whatever you say, say nothing. Youmust make up your mind not to speak until you return home.''   ``What I have to deal with is a sustained and deliberate attackon the whole system of justice,'' said Northern Ireland SecretaryTom King. He is Britain's top official in the province torn byRoman Catholic-Protestant strife.   Main targets are suspects who say nothing to police and thencome up with elaborate defenses, including detailed alibis, weeksor months later in court.   However, critics say no abuse of the right to silence canwarrant attacking the fundamentals of a free society.   As recently as 1981, a government-appointed inquiry intocriminal procedures concluded the right to silence should bepreserved.   Since 1973, Northern Ireland has had no-jury, one-judge courtsbecause of the difficulty of getting frightened juries to convictor witnesses to testify at IRA trials.   Both sides point to the fact that in Northern Ireland, less thanone-fourth of people arrested under anti-terrorism laws are charged.   Police say this reflects the ability of the guilty to staysilent: critics say it shows police make massive and unjustifiedarrests under anti-terrorist laws _ and the end of the right tosilence hands police more power to abuse.   Also last week, the government banned broadcast interviews withthe members of the IRA and 10 other militant groups in NorthernIreland.   To many, the measures smack of victory for the IRA: the Thatchergovernment abandoning democratic principles throughout Britain asit battles the IRA's campaign to end British rule in NorthernIreland.   ``To abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible riskagainst those who are verbally inadequate, those who are afraid,who are simply cautious,'' said Labor deputy leader Roy Hattersley.   Lord Denning, who retired in 1982 as Britain's most seniorjudge, retorted: ``The right to silence helps the guilty ... It isonly the guilty person who says, `I am not going to say anything.'''</TEXT></DOC>
