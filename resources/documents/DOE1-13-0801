The x-ray binary, 4U0115+63 is apparentlythe same source as Cas Gamma-1, detected by the Crimean AstrophysicalObservatory as a TeV gamma-ray source in 1971. It has been seen as apulsed TeV source by two groups in recent years. Because these sourceshave optical counterparts, they are better candidates for investigatingthe mechanisms of cosmic ray particle acceleration than Cygnus X-3.</TEXT></DOC>
