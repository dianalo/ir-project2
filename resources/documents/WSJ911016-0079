Mr. Dershowitz makes the irrelevant assertion thata Drexel &quot;team&quot; arrived at Occidental on Friday morning andreasons erroneously that Mr. Milken couldn't have been inpossession of inside information at the time of his phonecall to Ivan Boesky. Both the excerpt and the book make clearthat the information was conveyed in a phone call on Thursdaynight from Occidental's Ray Irani to Peter Ackerman, Mr.Milken's top lieutenant.</LP><TEXT>   Similarly, Mr. Dershowitz draws the false conclusion thatbecause trading was suspended early on Friday, Mr. Boeskycouldn't have traded on any inside information. To quote fromthe government's sentencing memorandum: &quot;At approximately10:23 a.m., the companies jointly announced that they werecontemplating a possible business combination; no furtherdetails, including the terms of any such combination, wereannounced.&quot; Trading resumed after the announcement. No onedisputes -- and trading records verify -- that Mr. Boeskybought over 3.5 million shares of Diamond Shamrock thatFriday.   Mr. Dershowitz concedes that James Dahl overheard aconversation between Messrs. Milken and Boesky on Mondayafter the Friday trading. Both the excerpt and book describethat discussion, in which Mr. Milken screamed at Mr. Boeskyabout the losses he was incurring in the stock he secretlyco-owned. This isn't insider trading, as the passage makesclear, but its aftermath. It indicates that Mr. Milken ownedthe stock with Mr. Boesky, as Mr. Boesky testified, which inand of itself violated Drexel's own rules.   Mr. Dershowitz ignores the fact, reported in the excerptand book, that Mr. Dahl also heard the conversation betweenMessrs. Milken and Boesky on Friday, as did Mr. Boesky'straders. The importance of this is two-fold: The witnesses'accounts are direct evidence of the insider trading (surelyone of the few instances recorded in which there areeyewitnesses to this kind of crime), and they corroborate Mr.Boesky's sworn testimony as to his discussions with Mr.Milken that day. This is emphatically not a case of Mr.Boesky's word against Mr. Milken's. Mr. Milken has nevertestified as to this conversation, and instead invoked theFifth Amendment.   Mr. Dershowitz points out that Judge Wood did not findconvincing evidence of insider trading by Mr. Milken. As thebook makes clear, that is because no evidence involving theDiamond Shamrock or other instances of insider trading withMr. Boesky was presented in the sentencing hearing over whichJudge Wood presided. The book explains that prosecutors chosenot to use any Boesky-related crimes in order to demonstratethat Mr. Milken's criminality was not confined to aconspiracy with a single person. Mr. Milken had alreadyadmitted committing felonies with Mr. Boesky.   Hence, Judge Wood's findings have no bearing on myindependent reporting with respect to Diamond Shamrock andother instances of insider trading. Nonetheless, and contraryto Mr. Dershowitz's assertion, Judge Wood's findingsfavorable to Mr. Milken -- as well as her finding that heattempted to obstruct justice -- are mentioned in the book.   Mr. Dershowitz's explanation of Mr. Milken's comment,&quot;What do you think it'd cost to buy every building from hereto the ocean?&quot; is fanciful and, in any event, it neveroccurred to those who heard the remark at the time it wasmade.   Contrary to Mr. Dershowitz's unfounded allegations, Ididn't ignore opinions favorable to Mr. Milken. I reviewedevery sentencing letter on his behalf received by the judge.I refer to one of them in the book and included otherinstances of generosity and kindness volunteered bycharacters in the book.   Far from the image projected by the Milken publicrelations campaign, the body of evidence accumulated by Mr.Milken's supporters demonstrates surprisingly littlegenerosity for a man of his extraordinary wealth andinfluence. The much-touted Milken charitable contributionsdate overwhelmingly from the period after he became a targetand was trying to court public opinion.   Finally, Mr. Dershowitz doesn't contradict the plain termsof Mr. Milken's plea bargain, which isn't revocable even ifhe lies to prosecutors now. In paragraph six of the Milkenplea agreement, dated April 22, 1990, four events are citedthat render the agreement revocable. Subsequent falsetestimony isn't cited, as it is in most plea agreements,including Mr. Boesky's. As the book explains, Mr. Milkencould be prosecuted for perjury (the &quot;additional crimes&quot; theprosecutor apparently meant in his effort to put a good faceon a serious concession by the government), but the threat ofperjury is a far cry from the unilateral ability ofprosecutors to revoke a bargain with an uncooperativewitness, as the book explains in detail.   Mr. Dershowitz has chosen to escalate what is now afive-year campaign of denial and obfuscation. So far thatstrategy has achieved a $600 million fine and 10-year prisonterm for Mr. Milken.
