(table)What a database server does that a file server can't do. (chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The major reason for networking microcomputers is to share resources -- notonly hard disks and printers, but also more intangible assets such asprograms and data.andM;The common networking model in corporate America uses a file server to storefiles in a centralized machine, with all processing of files performed atindividual workstations.andM;However, in a networked database environment, where the centrally locatedfiles are typically large and processing is intensive, this model imposes aheavy load on the network.andM;The file server responds to the workstation's requests by sending recordsfrom a file; the application running on the workstation examines each recordto determine if it is applicable to the current process.andP;  Creating a reportcontaining several dozen records could generate network traffic of thousandsof records before the workstation finds the few that it requires.andM;This process flow results from the traditional architecture of amicrocomputer database application: a single entity that unites both theapplication-specific portion (the front end) and database-specific portion(the back end) that performs the search and retrieval.andP;  When both componentsrun on the same machine, the entire database, or a large portion of it, mustbe processed by that machine.andM;But when a database is located remotely from the workstation, it makes moresense to put the database-retrieval engine with the data.andP;  A network nodecontaining both a database and the software for selecting records from it iscalled a database server.andP;  The workstation sends the server the criteria forselecting records; then the server searches the database and sends back onlythose records that match.andM;This review looks at three database server systems for the OS/2 operatingsystem: SQL Server version 1.0, jointly marketed by Ashton-Tate and MicrosoftCorp.; SQLBase version 3.6 from Gupta Technologies Inc.; and the DataServices component of IBM's Data Manager, part of OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;Although the current version OS/2 Extended Edition, version 1.1, incorporatesclient-server architecture in its Data Manager component, it does not supportmultiuser access to the server over a network.andP;  That feature is promised inversion 1.2, scheduled for late November release.andM;Gupta Technologies has also announced version 4.0 of SQLBase due in November.andM;The packages were tested on a variety of machines, including a Compaq 386/33and IBM PS/2 Model 70s connected over an Ungermann-Bass Ethernet network.andM;These servers implement the relational database model and accept databaserequests expressed in Structured Query Language (SQL).andP;  The de facto industrystandard is the enhanced SQL implemented by IBM in its mainframe database,DB2.andP;  The SQL languages of SQL Server and SQLBase are virtually completeimplementations of IBM's version, and each adds further enhancements.andM;IBM's Database Services accepts a subset of the mainframe language.andM;Database-server software also allows interfacing a variety of front ends tothe same database.andP;  Therefore, none of the reviewed systems comes with acomprehensive front-end system.andP;  While vendors have promised separate frontends for these systems, none is yet available.andM;These servers can be used without front-end systems.andP;  They come withinteractive SQL processors that accept direct keyboard input of SQL commands.andM;Extended Edition's SQL processor, called Query Manager, is the mostcomprehensive and capable of building small applications.andP;  All three serversimplement a C-language application programming interface (API) that allows adeveloper to write programs that manipulate the database on the server.andM;These facilities allow the development of customized program-drivenapplications and ad hoc queries and maintenance.andM;Network database servers require the attention of an administrator, but thisneed not be a full-time job.andP;  Often, the network administrator or anexperienced user can do the job.andM;Administration is eased by the relational model's design, in which allinformation about the database and user authorization is kept in the databaseitself, in the same format as all other data, but with appropriate securityrestrictions.andM;SQLBase and SQL Server are designed this way, keeping a set of system tablesin each database.andP;  SQLBase provides for administration through the entry ofSQL commands; the SQL Server administrator furnishes it through a menu systemor by entering commands.andP;  Both servers use SQL statements to control useraccess to databases, tables and columns (fields).andP;  IBM's Database Services,being a single-user system, provides none of these facilities.andM;A database server must ensure the database's integrity in the face ofmultiple updates in a multiuser environment, and in the event of user erroror a system crash.andP;  All three servers provide automatic data locking at therecord and page levels, but usually not at the table level.andM;This design provides all three servers with good protection againstconcurrent updates, yet it does not prevent access to other records in atable.andP;  However, SQL Server and Database Services can automatically upgrademultiple page locks on one table into a table lock to improve processingefficiency.andM;Deadlock detection guards against the case where each of two transactions iswaiting for the other to unlock needed resources with neither allowed toproceed.andP;  In this case, SQLBase arbitrarily terminates one transaction, whileSQL Server terminates the one that has posted the fewest changes to thedatabase.andP;  In all cases, any work done by the incomplete transaction isundone.andM;Transaction logging, an integral feature of an SQL-compliant database,protects against database corruption due to failure in the middle of a set ofrelated updates, such as a system crash or a forced termination to break adeadlock.andM;When the developer or user defines a set of updates as one transaction, theserver makes a &quot;before&quot; image of the database and logs all changes in atransaction log file.andP;  If all updates are successfully completed, the imageand log files are deleted; otherwise, the server can use them to restore theoriginal state of the database before the first update.andM;Differences in transaction-logging schemes are noted in the following productdescriptions.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
