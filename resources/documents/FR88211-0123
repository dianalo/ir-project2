This system of records is presently exempted under the specificexemption provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). At the time this system wasestablished, it was not maintained by a component of the Board ``whichperforms as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcementof criminal laws,'' and hence could not qualify for general exemption.The system is now maintained by a newly established Office of InspectorGeneral. A component of that Office, the Office of Investigations, performsas its principal function activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminallaws. The system thus now qualifies for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).The Board has determined that this is not a major rule for purposes ofExecutive Order 12291. Therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required.The RRB published the proposed rule on November 13, 1987, at 52 FR 43620-22for a 60 day comment period. No comments were received from the public.This final rule is identical to the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 200</ITAG>Railroad retirement, Railroad unemployment insurance, Privacy.Title 20 CFR Part 200 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 200_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Authority for the criminal law enforcement activities of the OIG'sOI is the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. app.(ii) Applicable information in the system of records described in thisparagraph is exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4) (Accounting of CertainDisclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and(I), (5), and (8), (Agency Requirements), (f) (Agency Rules) and (g) (CivilRemedies) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.(iii) To the extent that information in this system of records does notfall within the scope of this general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(j)(2)for any reason, the specific exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(2) is claimedfor such information. (See paragraph (g) of this section.)<T3>(3) Reasons for exemptions. </T3>The system of records described inthis section is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:(i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the individualnamed in the records, at his or her request, an accounting of each disclosureof records. This accounting must state the date, nature, and purpose ofeach disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient.Accounting of each disclosure would alert the subjects of an investigationto the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjectsof an investigation. The release of such information to the subjects ofan investigation would provide them with significant information concerningthe nature of the investigation, and could seriously impede or compromisethe investigation and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, thedestruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or otheragency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency inaccordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since the RRB is claiming thatthis system of records is exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerningaccess to records, this section is inapplicable and is exempted to theextent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d) of theAct.(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gainaccess to records pertaining to him or her, to request amendment of suchrecords, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records,and to contest the information contained in such records. Granting accessto records in this system of records could inform the subject of the investigationof an actual or potential criminal violation of the existence of that investigation,of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as tohis or her activities, of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses,and law enforcement personnel, and could provide information to enablethe subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to suchinformation could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, leadto the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence,or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative techniquesand procedures.(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its recordsonly such information about an individual as is relevant and necessaryto accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President.The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement,because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessityof specific information in the early stages of an investigation. Relevanceand necessity are often questions of judgment and timing, and it is onlyafter the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity ofsuch information can be established.(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to thegreatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when theinformation may result in adverse determinations about an individual'srights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The applicationof this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement by alertingthe subject of an investigation of the existence of the investigation,enabling the subject to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnessesimproperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover, incertain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be requiredto provide information to investigators, and information must be collectedfrom other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect informationfrom sources other than the subject of the investigation to verify theaccuracy of the evidence collected.(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whomit asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by the person,of the authority under which the information is sought and whether disclosureis mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes for which the informationis intended to be used; of the routine uses which may be made of the information;and of the effects on the person, if any, of not providing all or any partof the requested information. The application of this provision could providethe subject of an investigation with substantial information about thenature of that investigation.(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) (G) and (H) require an agency to publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice concerning its procedures for notifyingan individual at his request if the system of records contains a recordpertaining to him or her, how he or she can gain access to such a record,and how he or she can contest its contents. Since the RRB is claiming thatthe system of records is exempt from subsection (f) of the Act, concerningagency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records,these requirements are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent thatthese systems of records are exempted from subsections (f) and (d) of theAct. Although the RRB is claiming exemption from these requirements, RRBhas published such a notice concerning its notification, access, and contestprocedures because, under certain circumstances, RRB might decide it isappropriate for an individual to have access to all or a portion of hisor her records in this system of records.(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice concerning the categories of sources orrecords in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessaryto protect the confidentiality of the sources of information, to protectthe privacy of confidential sources and witnesses, and to avoid the disclosureof investigative techniques and procedures. Although RRB is claiming exemptionfrom this requirement, RRB has published such a notice in broad genericterms in the belief that this is all subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires.(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records withsuch accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonablynecessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any determinationabout the individual. Since the Act defines ``maintain'' to include thecollection of information, complying with this provision would preventthe collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely,and complete at the moment it is collected. In collecting information forcriminal law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advancewhat information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Facts arefirst gathered and then placed into a logical order to prove or disproveobjectively the criminal behavior of an individual. Material which mayseem unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected may take on addedmeaning or significance as the investigation progresses. The restrictionsof this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigativereport, thereby impending effective law enforcement. (x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts toserve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is madeavailable to any person under compulsory legal process when such processbecomes a matter of public record. Complying with this provision couldprematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject ofthe investigation. (xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules which shallestablish procedures whereby an individual can be notified in responseto his or her request if any system of records named by the individualcontains a record pertaining to him or her. The application of this provisioncould impede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the subjectof an investigation was able to use such rules to learn of the existenceof an investigation before it could be completed. In addition, mere noticeof the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others thattheir activities are under or may become the subject of an investigationand could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influencewitnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Sincethe RRB is claiming that these systems of records are exempt from subsection(d) of the Act, concerning access to records, the requirements of subsections(f)(2) through (5) of the Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining accessto such records, are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent that thissystem of records is exempted from subsection (d) of the Act. AlthoughRRB is claiming exemption from the requirements of subsection (f) of theAct, RRB has promulgated rules which establish Agency procedures because,under certain circumstances, it might be appropriate for an individualto have access to all or a portion of his or her records in this systemof records. These procedures are described elsewhere in this Part. (xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails tocomply with the requirements concerning access to records under subsections(d)(1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under subsection (e)(5)of the Act; and any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to havean adverse effect on an individual. Since the RRB is claiming that thissystem of records is exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1),(2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5), and (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisionsof subsection (g) of the Act are inapplicable and are exempted to the extentthat this system or records is exempted from those subsections of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the authority of the Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Beatrice Ezerski,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary to the Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-2370 Filed 2-3-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7905-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
