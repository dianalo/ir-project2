The Merchant Marine Act, 1936Sections 605(c) and 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended,46 App. U.S.C. 1175(c) and 1223(a), collectively, (the ``Act'') mandatethat a hearing be conducted prior to approval of applications for operating-differentialsubsidy (``ODS'') authorized by the Act. The Act is administered by theMaritime Administration/ Maritime Subsidy Board (collectively ``MARAD'')under authority delegated by the secretary of Transportation (49 CFR 1.66-1.67).Section 605(c) provides that no ODS contracts can be made with respectto vessels whose contemplated operations would be in addition to an existingessential service provided by citizens of the United States unless, aftera ``proper hearing of all parties,'' certain specified determinations aremade. These determinations are that<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * the service already provided by vessels of United States registryis inadequate, and that in the accomplishment of the purposes and policyof * * * [the] * * * Act additional vessels should be operated . . . [insuch service].</ITAG>This section also provides for a compulsory public hearing, after noticeto all vessel operators in a particular service, before an ODS contractcan be made for a vessel intended to be operated<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * in an essential service served by two or more citizens of theUnited States with vessels of United States registry * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where it is determined that the effect of such a contract would undulyadvantage or be unduly prejudicial as between citizens of the United States.In such a situation the contract can be made only where it is determinedfollowing the public hearing<ITAG tagnum="20">*  * * that it is necessary to enter into such contract in order toprovide adequate service by vessels of United States registry.</ITAG>The provisions in section 605(c) concerning hearing requirements applyequally to amendments to existing contracts. Thus, for example, an ODSoperator receiving subsidy for a specified number of vessels pursuant toits ODS contract, may still be subject to the hearing requirements of section605(c) should it wish to increase the total number of subsidized vesselsor include vessels of a significantly different type in its current service.<T3>See, Sea-Land </T3>v.<T3> Kreps,</T3> 566 F.2d 763, 767 (D.C. Cir. 1977).Section 805(a) concerns the operations of vessels in the domestic tradesby an ODS operator either directly or through affiliates. Two issues reviewedunder section 805(a) are whether grant of the application would (1) resultin unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusivelyin the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (2) be prejudicial to theobjects and policy of the act. Under this provision, ``[e]very person,firm or corporation having any interest in such application shall be permittedto intervene and the Secretary of Transportation shall give a hearing tothe applicant and the intervenors.'' Any party to the hearing may addressthe ``objects and policy'' issue, but only a person ``operating exclusivelyin the coastwise or intercoastal service'' may oppose the application onthe ground of ``unfair competition'' to such a person. <T3>See, e.g., States Steamship Co., </T3>5 SRR 1111, 1126-27 and n.17(SOC 1965).2. Procedural Considerations MARAD's current Rules of Practice and Procedure, 46 CFR Part 201 <T3>et seq. </T3>govern hearings before both the Maritime Administrationand the Maritime Subsidy Board (46 CFR 201.1). These rules are to be ``construedto secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceedingwith full protection for the rights of all parties therein.'' (<T3>Id.</T3>) MARAD believes that a supplement to the current rules would enable moreefficient and effective accomplishment of this purpose. The proposed proceduresare intended to increase the degree of flexibility available to MARAD instructuring these proceedings. An assumption of the proposed proceduresis that questions of law applicable to a specific set of facts are nothighlighted by the evidentiary process, but rather are better clarifiedby pleadings and, in some situations, oral argument. <T3>National Air Carrier Association </T3>v. <T3>CAB, </T3>436 F.2d 185, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1970). In proposing these procedures, MARAD is mindful of the various requirementsthat must be accommodated in the hearing process employed. The AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq., </T3>(the ``APA'') specifies hearing procedures applicable``* * * in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determinedon the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.'' 5 U.S.C. 554(a).Courts have generally interpreted this provision to mean that the APA hearingrequirements attach only where the requirement for a hearing is providedfor in a separate underlying statute. <T3>See, e.g., Philadelphia Newspaper, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>NRC, </T3>727 F.2d 1195 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <T3>Gallagher and Ascher Co. </T3>v. <T3>Simon, </T3><T3>687 F.2d. 1067 (7th Cir. 1982); </T3><T3>State of Colorado </T3>v. <T3>Veterans Administration, </T3>602 F.2d 926 (10th Cir. 1979), <T3>cert. denied </T3>444 U.S. 1014 (1980). Some courts have held the APAhearing requirements to apply, even in the absence of language in the underlyingstatute specifying that the hearing must be conducted ``on the record.''<T3>See Steadman </T3>v. <T3>Sec, </T3>450 U.S. 91, 96 n.13 (1981). The form of the hearing is generallydependent on the substantive nature of the hearing Congress intended toprovide in the underlying statute. <T3>City of West Chicago </T3>v. <T3>N.R.C., </T3>701 F.2d 632 (7th Cir. 1983); <T3>Buttrey </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>690 F.2d 1170 (5th Cir. 1982), <T3>cert. denied </T3>461 U.S. 927 (1983). In promulgating these proceduresMARAD is not determining that an ``on the record'' hearing (as that phraseis used in the APA and in cases construing it) is strictly required, orrequired in some situations, under the Act for Section 605(c) and 805(a)applications. MARAD is proposing hearing procedures that adhere to the fundamental conceptsof administrative due process. Consistent with this approach, MARAD isproposing procedures which satisfy due process requirements for notice,comment and a statement of reasons for its decisions. <T3>York </T3>v. <T3>Secretary of the Treasury, </T3>774 F.2d 417 (10th Cir. 1985). MARAD is also proposing to employ alternative hearing procedures wherethe essential facts are not in dispute and where, as a result, MARAD'sdecision will turn primarily on issues of law, policy or discretion. <T3>General Motors Corp. </T3>v. <T3>FERC, </T3>656 F.2d 791 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Storer Broadcasting Co., </T3>351 U.S. 192 (1956). Further, MARAD alsois proposing to establish a threshold requirement intended to assist itin determining beforehand the nature and scope of the hearing, <T3>Citizens for Allegan County </T3>v. <T3>F.P.C. </T3>414 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1969); <T3>Costle </T3>v. <T3>Pacific Legal Foundation, </T3>445 U.S. 198 (1980); <T3>see also Weinberger </T3>v. <T3>Hynson, Wescott andamp; Dunning, Inc., </T3>412 U.S. 609 (1973). Theseprocedures will further the primary purpose of the evidentiary phase ofthe hearing process, namely the development of a record for the determinationof the basic factual issues in dispute. <T3>See, Minnesota </T3>v. <T3>N.R.C., </T3>602 F.2d 412, 416-17 (D.C. Cir. 1979). 3. Experience Under Sections 605(c) and 805(a) Since passage of the 1936 Act, MARAD has conducted numerous proceedingsunder sections 605(c) and 805(a) involving the full panoply of proceduraltechniques provided in 46 CFR Part 201 <T3>et seq. </T3>Many of the applications involving complex and hotly contested issues haverequired several years to reach conclusion.\1\<NOTE/> Congress itself has noted the seemingly interminable lengthand cost of these hearings.\2\<NOTE/> MARAD has on occasion used alternative procedures. In DocketNo. S-605, MARAD held a one day hearing with the consent of the partiesparticipating. In Docket No. S-437/438, MARAD held that a show cause procedurein appropriate circumstances was a valid method of resolving issues arisingunder section 605(c) and in Docket Nos. S-813, and S-807/822, MARAD assigneda member of the Maritime Subsidy Board to hear evidence in an applicationunder Section 605(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Cf., <T3>e.g., </T3>Docket Nos. S-514, <T3>et al., </T3>S-543, S-724, S-749. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R. Rep. No. 91-1073, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), 42,accompanying H.R. 15424 (later enacted as the Merchang Marine Act of 1970(P.L. 91-469)).While a general reservation is provided in 46 CFR 201.9 allowing for waiverof the normal procedures, no specific provisions exist for alternativeprocedures. The proposed procedures will fill that gap. They do not representa radical departure from prior practice but an attempt to provide guidelinesgoverning selection of appropriate hearing procedures as opposed to thead hoc determinations made previously. They do represent an attempt ataccording all parties that ``speedy'' determination of rights intendedin MARAD's current Rules of Practice and Procedure, 46 CFR 201.1 and inthe APA, section 556. The proposed procedures also reflect recent developments. On May 12, 1987,MARAD consolidated under section 211 of the Act previously determined traderoutes into eight essential trade routes. (52 FR 17879). This redesignationdid not address changes in contractual subsidized operations. Operatorswere invited to apply for amended subsidized service, (Docket No. R-112,52 FR 17884), for which applications hearings would then be provided, ifappropriate. <T3>In American Transport Lines, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Burnley, </T3>No. 87-2390 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 1988), the court grantedstanding in a section 605(c) application to an operator competing on thesame trade route as the applicants, but providing service to the same portsonly by intermodal service. MARAD's prior precedent has been to permitstanding only to those companies providing direct service by U.S.-flagvessels in the trade in question. <T3>Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc.</T3>, 16 SRR 465, 470 (MSB 1975). As a result of the decision in <T3>American Transport Lines</T3>, MARAD announced by <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice of May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17134) its intentto consider a change in policy governing proceedings under section 605(c)(Docket S-829). A number of operators submitted comments in that docketand those coments will be incorporated in this rulemaking docket.The proposed procedures recognize, as a result of the <T3>American Transport </T3>case, and as a result of MARAD's study of tradepatterns under section 211, standing in regard to service provided by intermodaloperations. However, such an operator must still meet a threshold burdenas described in the proposed procedures.Base on case precedent, standing will be granted only to a U.S.-flag vesseloperator, and only when and to such extent the operator provides an existingservice, or has firm and definite plans to provide a service by a showingthat its vessels operate in the same trade or on the same trade route asthat proposed by the applicant and with which the specific proposed servicewould be competitive. Although an intervenor need not call the same specificproposed ports by direct vessel calls, the intervenor must demonstratecompetition by intermodal service for cargo moving through ports in theservice proposed by the applicant. MARAD undertakes to apply the most efficient and effective means of hearingavailable for each new application it receives. To this end, MARAD proposestwo distinct alternative proceedings. The first alternative would involve matters of significant complex factualissues and anticipated submission of extensive evidence. As has been theusual custom of MARAD, this application would probably be referred to anadministrative law judge for hearing in accordance with existing proceduresin 46 CFR Part 201. For example, an application under section 605(c), fora new twenty-year subsidy contract, if such a contract was to be awarded,involving substantial additional service and contested by parties havingstanding to assert a right to a section 605(c) hearing, would probablyfollow existing procedures. The second alternative involves a Show CauseProceeding where the pleadings disclose no material factual issues in disputeor such issues can be resolved based on available information subject toofficial notice. An example under this alternative would be an applicationfor a short term subsidy (e.g., three years or less), involving additionalservice and a limited trade area. Because of the many variable circumstancessurrounding each subsidy application, the foregoing examples are only providedas guidance in the hearing selection process. The Administration may, in its discretion, direct further hearing or thesubmission of briefs on legal issues, or hold oral argument under any ofthe alternative proceedings. One or more members of the Administrationmay conduct an oral or evidentiary hearing. A member who is not presentat the hearing may participate in the decision where the hearing and anoral argument, if any, have been stenographically reported. This type ofproceeding would be appropriate when a timely decision appears to be criticallyimportant. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section by Section Analysis of Part 203 </ITAG>Section 1: Scope of Rules The proposed procedures are intended to apply to hearings mandated by sections605(c) and 805(a) of the Act. They supplement the Administration's existingRules of Practice and Procedure in 46 CFR Part 201 and shall not be construedas inconsistent with that part. Section 2: ApplicationsThis section states the basic minimum information which MARAD believesessential in order for it to properly evaluate an application within thescope of the proposed procedures. Generally, the information requirementsapply for applications under both sections 605(c) and 805(a). This sectionalso provides for <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice for all applications involving a statutorilymandated hearing, and allows for the filing of comments by any person.Section 3: Opposition to ApplicationsBy requiring the simultaneous filing of a petition for leave to interveneand an answer, this section is intended to accomplish two primary purposes.First, the petition for leave to intervene is intended to enable MARADto determine whether, under existing precedent, the filing party has standingto oppose the application. By requiring the simultaneous filing of an answer,it is anticipated that both time and administrative expenses may be reduced.Subsections (b) and (d) specify the criteria applicable to granting standingto oppose an application, and are consistent with past practice and existingprecedent. The Board has in the past granted standing to oppose an applicationto existing US-flag operators with competitive service, <T3>See, e.g., Lykes Bros. Steamship Co.,_ODS Renewal,</T3> 18 SRR 1389(MSB, 1978), and to those having ``firm and definite'' plans to enter aservice for which an applicant is seeking an ODS contract or an amendmentto its existing ODS contract. <T3>Delta Steamship Lines, Inc.</T3>, 17 SRR 1369 (MSB, 1977); <T3>See Sea-Land Service, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Conner</T3>, 418 F.2d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1969). Such ``firm anddefinite'' plans must be demonstrated by concrete steps taken in preparationto initiating the service.Section 4: RepliesThis section provides for a reply by the applicant to answers which havebeen filed by persons purporting to have the requisit standing. No provisionis made for further pleading.Decisions on the grant or denial of standing are final administration actionsand may be directly appealed to the Secretary of Transportation under therules applicable to such actions.Section 5: HearingsThis section provides guidelines for determining the type of hearing tobe granted by MARAD. The procedures outlined are intended to expedite MARAD'sdecisional process by allowing for less than full evidentiary proceedings,when appropriate. Separation of functions shall be provided for as setout in section 554 of the APA. A new provision incorporated in the proposedrule involves the use of Show Cause proceedings. As contemplated, a ShowCause Proceeding would be initiated (1) where the pleadings disclose nomaterial factual issues in dispute, or (2) such issues are susceptibleto resolution on the basis of information that is properly subject to officialnotice.Another provision involves the use of a hearing before less than all membersof the Administration. Any member absent from the hearing may participatein the consideration and decision in which the record has been preparedin accordance with 46 CFR 201.147 and oral argument, if any, is stenographicallyreported. This follows the long recognized principle that due process issatisfied even if a member is absent during the taking of evidence andoral argument when there is a complete record available to all memberson which to base their decision. <T3>Anniston Mfg. Co. </T3>v. Davis, 301 U.S. 337 (1937); <T3>Porter andamp; Dietsch, Inc., </T3>v. <T3>F.T.C.</T3>, 605 F.2d 294 (7th Cir. 1979), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 445 U.S. 950 (1980); <T3>Gearhart andamp; Otis, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>S.E.C.</T3>, 348 F.2d 798, <T3>reh'g denied </T3>(D.C. Cir. 1965). <T3>See</T3> 3 K. Davis, ``Administrative Law Treatise'' sec. 17:2 (2ded. 1980).<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.While this rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmentalpolicies, it is considered significant because it may be expected to generatesignificant public interest. However, because the economic impact shouldbe minimal, further regulatory evaluation is not necessary. Moveover, theMaritime Administrator certifies that this amendment will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This rulemaking does not significantly effect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.This proposed rulemaking does not contain any additional collection ofinformation which would require approval pursuant to the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>46 CFR Part 201Administrative practice and procedure.46 CFR Part 203Administrative practice and procedure, Maritime carriers.Accordingly, 46 CFR Part 201 is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 201_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE</ITAG>1.
