That's the question magazine readers are asking about some cryptic new ads that show a stylish young woman named Maggie but don't seem to be selling anything. &quot;Maggie is first to arrive with the newest fashions,&quot; says one ad in which she's sitting in a taxi. In another, she chats on the phone at an elegant restaurant: &quot;Why did Company A have breakfast with Bank B? Maggie tells me.&quot;    Maggie, it turns out, is supposed to symbolize the magazine industry. She personifies all the reasons an advertiser should buy space in magazines. The only clue to Maggie's identity, however, is the fine print in the ads mentioning the Magazine Publishers of America, a trade group.    &quot;The ad campaign really stands out,&quot; says Phillip Joanou, chairman of Dailey andamp; Associates Advertising. &quot;But I don't get it.&quot;    Neither do a lot of other people. Mystified readers have called or written the trade group seeking clarification. One reader said she and her guests analyzed the ads at a dinner party. Some people have asked where they might buy the snazzy convertible Maggie is driving in one of the ads. And a few people were even angry; they expected an explanation of the Maggie ad to follow a couple of pages later in their magazines.    The magazine association won't leave readers in the dark forever. It plans to explain Maggie's identity in another set of ads this fall. But for now, James Guthrie, executive vice president of the association, is delighted with all the confusion.    &quot;The objective is to show advertisers that magazines can do what TV gets all the credit for -- generating attention and awareness,&quot; he says. &quot;The Maggie ads are certainly getting attention.&quot; But whether Maggie generates more magazine ad revenue remains to be seen. -   Food Companies Slow   Flow of New Products   THIS YEAR marketers are again flooding supermarket shelves with new products -- everything from Cajun popcorn to ketchup in spray cans. But some marketing consultants see signs that the 1980s new-product boom is cooling a bit.    &quot;Some manufacturers like Campbell and Frito-Lay feel gunshy,&quot; says Martin Friedman, editor of Gorman's New Product News. &quot;They've been burned introducing lots of products and not seeing results.&quot;    He notes that the number of new products unveiled through July 31 is up only 5% this year, compared with a 21% growth rate a year ago. The most active categories: condiments, candy, gum and snacks. Among the most sluggish: dairy products, cigarettes and toiletries.    &quot;Slotting allowances have had a chilling effect on some companies' new product plans,&quot; Mr. Friedman says, referring to the rising fees retailers charge to stock a new product. What's more, marketers aren't dishing up any hot new ethnic foods or new products with special nutritional claims. Says Mr. Friedman, &quot;There's an excitement gap in the food industry this year.&quot;    But the new-product growth rate may pick up this fall. Food companies are expected to capitalize on recent publicity about the health hazard of dietary fat. They're also developing more new products, such as yogurt, with aspartame low-calorie sweetener.    Seagram Fails to Make   The U.S. Olympic Team   MONEY USUALLY talks in the world of sports marketing. But not always -- if your product happens to be a wine cooler.    Seagram Co. had hoped to give its coolers a sales and image boost by buying a U.S. Olympic Committee official sponsorship this year. After all, if beers can be sponsors, why not coolers?    But the Olympic committee nixed Seagram. &quot;Wine coolers are a relatively new category, and there was a lack of familiarity with their alcohol content,&quot; says John Krimsky, an Olympic committee official. &quot;But we may permit coolers in 1992.&quot; Some marketing consultants say the committee also bristled at the thought of mixing the wholesome Olympics with the Seagram name, which is associated more with hard liquor than coolers.    Undaunted, Seagram found a way around the U.S. committee. The company is now publicizing its plans to send about 550 family members of U.S. Olympic athletes to the summer games in Seoul free of charge.    Yet even this promotion encountered resistance. A few U.S. teams, such as the gymnastic group, declined to participate in the family program because their members tend to be much younger than the legal drinking age, a Seagram spokesman says.    Cherry-Flavored Sodas   Are Losing Their Steam   THE MARKET for cherry-flavored soft drinks isn't so sweet anymore.    Hailed as major new-product hits when they were introduced in the mid-1980s, cherry concoctions have started to lose market share. &quot;There was a lot of nostalgia at first among people who grew up with fountain cherry Coke,&quot; says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest. &quot;But the cherry drinks don't seem to have a long-term following.&quot;    This spring, he says, Cherry Coke's share of soft-drink sales in food stores dropped to 1.2% from 1.7% in 1987; Cherry 7Up fell to 1% from 1.3%; and Cherry Cola Slice dipped to 0.1% from 0.2%.    But soft-drink marketers claim they aren't discouraged. In fact, PepsiCo Inc., the maker of Slice, is proceeding to test market Wild Cherry Pepsi in Wyoming and Oregon. Tom Bayer, a spokesman for Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos., concedes that the &quot;big burst of interest&quot; when Cherry 7Up hit the market last year has died down. &quot;But we're pleased with our repeat business,&quot; he says. &quot;We feel we're holding our own well.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
