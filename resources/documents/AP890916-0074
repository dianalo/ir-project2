At noon EDT today, Hugo's center near 15.6 north latitude and59.0 west longitude, or about 175 miles east-southeast of the Frenchresort island of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. It was expectedto hit the island this afternoon or tonight, said forecaster MartinNelson, before moving in the direction of Puerto Rico.   The hurricane was moving west at 14 mph, sending showers andgusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean.   The storm's strength flucutated this morning, dipping from 150mph at 6 a.m. to 140 mph at 9 a.m. It was expected to continue to doso as the size of the eye contracts and expands, forecasters said,but storm-force winds of 39 mph and above extend 150 miles from thecenter.   In Paris, Air France announced it was canceling all three of itsflights scheduled today to Martinique because of the storm.Miami-based Eastern Airlines planned no cancellations or reroutingstoday, but spokesman Robin Matell said, ``We'll keep monitoring itvery closely.''   Forecasters won't be able to tell for five or six days whetherHugo will hit the coastal United States, forecaster Jim Gross said.   A hurricane warning was posted from St. Lucia north to St. Martinincluding the British Virgin Islands, and a hurricane watch the U.S.Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico may be upgraded to a warning today. Atropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Barbados andSt. Vincent, according to the hurricane center.   Forecasters classed the hurricane in Category 4, meaning it isconsidered capable of extreme damage. If its sustained winds grow to155 mph, it would be classified in Category 5, capable ofcatastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit theUnited States since record-keeping began; the latest, Camille in1969, killed 256 people.   Islanders were warned to expect rainfall amounts of 5 to 10inches and a storm surge with waves 10 feet higher than normal.   Dominica, Guadeloupe's closest neighbor to the south, has onlyrecently recovered from the destruction David wrought 10 years ago,when floods and mud slides poured down from mountains onto coastaltowns and villages.   On Martinique, the next island in the chain, school officialscanceled classes today.   A disaster response team from Miami's Metro Dade Fire Departmentestablished a communications center in Barbados, about 200 milessouth of Hugo's path, to assess damage and coordinate emergencymedical treatment throughout the Leeward Islands.   At the U.S. Coast Guard station in San Juan, Puerto Rico,guardsmen were preparing for the storm Friday.   ``You go around and police the area and pick up anything that canbecome a missile hazard,'' Petty Officer Alan Burd said.   The island chain has escaped the worst of previous hurricanesthis year. Dean, Erin and Gabrielle turned north toward Bermudabefore reaching the Caribbean. This time, there were no signs of thelowering atmospheric pressure that veered the others away.   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricaneseason, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms havemaximum sustained winds of 39 mph and reach hurricane status whenwinds reach 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
