Two months later,he was out of work.   Mikel Duffy hoped to climb the ladder of high finance with a newjob at a New York export-import firm. A year later, convinced she'dnever reach the first rung, she quit.   Two tales of job troubles. One West Coast, one East Coast. Oneveteran, one beginner. But both are among the small but increasingnumber of Americans who've accused their Japanese or Koreanemployers of job discrimination.   The explosion of Asian-owned companies has created jobs forAmericans but has also generated complaints from workers claimingthey were rejected, denied promotion or laid off because of theircolor, race, sex or ethnic group.   ``You should be evaluated for your performance _ not what youlook like, who you are or your race or sex,'' said Duffy, one ofthree women who've sued C. Itoh andamp; Co. (America) Inc., a Japanesecompany, for discrimination.   Some say cultural clashes arise because the Japanese areunaccustomed to minority workers and female managers. Others callit intentional bias.   Some complaints are in court. The government is investigatingothers. Some probes have led to financial settlements and newpolicies.   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., for example, agreed thisspring to pay $6 million to 377 blacks and women after a3{-year-long investigation by the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission concluded the company should have hired them sooner.Honda admitted no wrongdoing.   Most complaints involve Japanese companies, simply because oftheir dominance of the U.S. market. The cases represent a tinyfraction of 190,000 Americans working for Japanese-owned firms, anumber expected to rise to 900,000 by 1995. As of 1986, 539Japanese manufacturing firms had been established in the UnitedStates.   Many business experts insist the Japanese generally are goodbosses, known for innovative management and fierce loyalty fromworkers.   Still, tensions have surfaced when East meets West in theworkplace. Some say it's because the Japanese live in a homogeneoussociety and male-oriented work world.   ``They import their own cultural bias,'' said lawyer LewisSteel, whose firm has been involved in three cases in which womenhave charged Japanese companies with job discrimination.   ``They run their corporations (here) in a way that reallymirrors the structure in Japan,'' he said. ``They have to adapt toour culture. ... It is not easy for them to do that. It was noteasy for companies in the South to rid themselves of overtdiscrimination.''   Labor experts note that the record of U.S. firms isn'tunblemished. In 1983, for instance, General Motors settled a raceand sex discrimination case for $42 million, the EEOC said.   Bias complaints, some pending for two years, include:   _ Hirings: Two former executives of NEC Electronics Inc., amicroprocessor and semiconductor firm, claim they were unfairlydemoted. They assert they'd advised against a policy of dismissingAmericans to make room for Japanese workers. When the companyremoved them from the board of directors, they filed suit and thenwere fired, according to their breach-of-contract suit.   ``They had opposed discrimination and they were retaliatedagainst. They were whistleblowers,'' said attorney Robert Kahn. AnNEC lawyer denies the claims.   _ Firings: Nine former workers, mostly engineers, have suedHyundai Electronics America, claiming they were hired to begin acomputer division in California but lost their jobs when it closedmonths later in 1984, although Koreans were transferred within theorganization.   The EEOC has also sued the Korean-owned firm, chargingdiscrimination in favor of Korean workers. A lawyer for Hyundaidenies the charges, noting the Koreans were trainees, in Americatemporarily.   Ex-employees aren't mollified. ``I disrupted my life to jointhem,'' said Carlson, adding he was laid off two months after beingguaranteed job security. ``They got whatever they wanted from us,and they let us go.''   _ Promotions: The EEOC in New York is investigating claimsJapanese men get preferential treatment and women have no promotionopportunities at The Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., saidattorney Susan Ritz, who is representing three women.   In the separate case against C. Itoh, Duffy said she was hiredas a clerk two years ago and soon given other duties. When when sherequested relief from clerical work to tackle new tasks, she saidshe was told ``in a fatherly, reassuring manner, `No, no, it's OK,if you feel you can't handle this, you can go back to your old joband we can get a man to do yours.'''   The EEOC, however, found no discrimination at C. Itoh and``anyone who possesses the proper job-related skills can bepromoted,'' said lawyer Bill Carmell, representing the company. ``Iget a little frustrated (with the attitude) since we're a Japanesecompany, we must have mistreated women.''   Another sex discrimination case was resolved in a 1987multi-million dollar settlement involving Sumitomo Corp. of Americaand 13 female clerical workers. Sumitomo stipulated it hadn'tviolated laws.   That settlement ended 10 years of litigation, including a 1982Supreme Court decision holding that subsidiaries of Japanese firmsin the United States are bound by American laws barring job bias.   Three Japanese automakers also have come under EEOC scrutinty.The agency said:   _ Nissan is discussing settlement of a race, sex and agediscrimination charge.   _ Toyota last year agreed to add five minority workers at twoCalifornia plants and pay $47,880 after a race and national origindiscrimination probe.   _ Honda in 1987 agreed to pay $457,111 to 85 people following anage bias investigation.   In March, Honda settled a case after the EEOC claimed its hiringpractices were discriminatory. In its early years, Honda, based inMarysville, Ohio, hired only people who lived within a 20-mileradius of the plant. The radius was later increased to 30 miles,and the policy was also applied when Honda opened an engine plantat Anna, Ohio.   The 30-mile limit excluded potential workers from Columbus, 35miles away, which has the region's largest minority population _about 24 percent.   Honda spokesman Bill Lambert said the Marysville area had askedthe automaker to hire locally because manufacturing layoffs andclosings in the early '80s had put thousands out of work.   But Florence Warren, Columbus affirmative-action administrator,said, ``Thirty miles is ludicrous. If you can get to work and youcan apply for a job, you ought to be hired on your merit.''   Honda last fall expanded its hiring area to 17 counties andagreed to recruit and advertise in Columbus and implement newtraining programs. Some 3.4 percent of Honda's 5,700 ``associates''are black, Lambert said.   Experts say the Japanese will adjust quickly, but Carlson, now aconsultant, feels cheated.   ``If I was going to Korea and opened up a little business,solicited help from senior technology people and closed it all downand left them stranded, my guess is ... an iron boot would removeme summarily,'' he said.   ``I was wooed and pursued in this job with great vigor. Theyjust kind of deposited me. The whole thing just stinks.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues PMs, July 26</NOTE></DOC>
