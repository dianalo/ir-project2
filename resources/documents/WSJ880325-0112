The criminal charges and the company's pleas to making false statements, which had been expected, involve mischarging for labor, false invoices and inflated bills submitted to the Defense Department for work performed by the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company's government electronics group in Scottsdale, Ariz. The government alleged that the overcharges occurred between 1979 and 1984.    As part of the plea agreement filed in federal district court in Phoenix, Ariz., Motorola promised to cooperate with the continuing investigation of current or former corporate officials. The Justice Department said it won't seek additional charges against the company related to the disputed contracts.    The case marks the first criminal charges of this magnitude brought against a top defense contractor since the embarrassing collapse in June 1987 of the department's criminal fraud case against St. Louis-based General Dynamics Corp.    Referring to that unsuccessful prosecution, William Hendricks, chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said in an interview that the case &quot;illustrates the government's continued dedication to investigate and prosecute&quot; such complex and time-consuming military procurement fraud cases. Mr. Hendricks said, &quot;There have been some questions raised about that issue.&quot; He added that the plea agreement &quot;shows that we are continuing (in) our determination&quot; to discover and punish overcharges by major military contractors.    Motorola said the agreements won't have a material adverse effect on its business or its financial position. It said it took reserves last year to cover the settlement, which it put at $9.98 million. The company said that the reports of a larger settlement reflect administrative adjustments and other voluntary payments. Justice Department officials pegged the settlement at nearly $16.8 million, but said that Motorola has already paid nearly $6.9 million of that total to the government.    In a statement, the electronic equipment maker said that, in the past, the systems of its government electronics group &quot;were not adequate to ensure total compliance with applicable laws and regulations.&quot; It said the group has since &quot;greatly expanded&quot; its compliance efforts. Last year, the group accounted for $540 million of Motorola's total sales of $6.71 billion.    Motorola stock closed at $44.50, down $1.875, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Law enforcement officials said they weren't aware of any other criminal investigations pending against Motorola or its units. Although the Justice Department agreement didn't preclude the Pentagon from taking other sanctions, prosecutors said that after the plea was filed, the Defense Department, citing the company's cooperation, signed a separate agreement promising that Motorola won't be suspended or debarred from military contracts.    The company was charged with submitting $2.5 million in bills for labor, materials and other direct costs involving a Navy satellite communications systems, although Motorola officials knew the costs had been incurred for work on a separate Navy satellite contract. The government then relied on the inflated costs to negotiate a price for a subsequent contract, according to court documents.    The government also charged that Motorola submitted inflated labor costs for work on a target-detecting device used on the Navy's Standard missile. And it alleged that the company submitted false invoices, including one that overstated the cumulative labor costs for work on a similar device used on the Navy's Phoenix missile.    ---   Robert L.
