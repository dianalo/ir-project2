Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell12.9% in late May compared with a year earlier. The annualselling rate for domestic passenger cars in all of May was aweak 6.1 million vehicles. That's up from 5.5 million inApril, but lower than March's 6.2 million selling pace.Meanwhile, the sales pace of imported cars was 2.2 millionlast month, down from 2.3 million in April.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We hit bottom in January. But we've been bouncing arounda recessionary level of sales&quot; since, said Martin Zimmerman,Ford Motor Co.'s chief economist. &quot;There's nothing to writehome about.&quot;   Overall, Americans bought 400,051 North American-made carsand trucks in the May 21 to May 31 period, down from 459,109vehicles a year ago. The seasonally adjusted pace of domesticcar sales fell to 6.7 million from 7.1 million a yearearlier. But the sales pace was higher than analysts'expectations of a six million selling rate.   For all of May, sales of domestic and imported cars andtrucks fell 11.7% from a year ago to 1,156,037.   Industry executives say they expect sales to improveslowly during the rest of the year, but they don't expect aquick boom. &quot;I don't think the market's going to changemuch,&quot; said Robert McCurry, executive vice president ofToyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm. &quot;We see the market asvery tough.&quot;   Some dealers complain that when consumers decide to buy anew vehicle, they're haggling harder than ever for the bestdeal possible. &quot;Customers want better than a fair deal,&quot; saidJim Forster, a salesman at Foulger Ford in Arcadia, Calif.&quot;They think they're doing us a favor by taking the vehiclesoff our hands.&quot;   General Motors Corp.'s combined car and truck sales fell11.9% last month to 413,992 vehicles. Ford Motor Co. had an11.1% drop in car sales, and a 13.4% decline in truck sales.Despite the declines, the auto maker managed to slightlyincrease its share of the U.S. car market.   Demand for minivans helped bolster Chrysler Corp.'s salesin May. Minivan sales rose 4% compared with a year ago, and13% compared with April. But even with robust minivan demand,Chrysler's truck sales slid 10% last month. The auto maker'scar sales, meanwhile, dropped 20.8% in May. Chrysler's shareof the U.S. car market slipped 1.1 percentage points in themonth to 8.7%.   Some Japanese auto makers that build vehicles in the U.S.also saw sales drop during May. Toyota Motor Corp. posted a6.9% drop in car and truck sales last month, while HondaMotor Co. had a 4.8% drop in import and domestic car sales.   Meanwhile, American Isuzu Motors Inc.'s sales of cars andtrucks rose 8.3% in May, and Subaru of America Inc. posted anincrease of 7.9% last month.   Virtually every European luxury car maker suffered in May.The European companies say they're sufferingdisproportionately because of the federal luxury tax, whichapplies to cars priced higher than $30,000. Jaguar Cars Inc.,the U.S. marketing arm of Ford's British luxury brand, soldonly 525 cars during the entire month of May, a 66.7% dropfrom sales of 1,575 a year earlier. Audi of America Inc.posted a 37.7% sales drop in May. European auto makers' shareof the U.S. car market dropped one percentage point to 4% inMay from a year earlier.
