The editorial inaccurately asserts that public-transit legislation was passed &quot;without a single public hearing ever being held.&quot; In fact, while transit legislation was being formulated, the House Subcommittee on Surface Transportation held hearings at which more than 50 witnesses delivered testimony on our nation's public-transit needs. The Senate held similar hearings.    Congress provided funding for Metro Rail, at least in part because of statements by Ralph Stanley, the former administrator of the federal Urban Mass Transportation Association (UMTA). Mr. Stanley, who was appointed by President Reagan, declared last September that &quot;the Los Angeles Metro Rail was among the most cost-effective projects in the nation.&quot;    The federal share of the project's cost will be only 50% -- not 60% as the editorial claims. In fact, the total nonfederal share, provided by state and local funds, will be twice the nonfederal match required by law. Mr. Stanley, while he was still administrator, said, &quot;The people of Los Angeles have put their money behind their belief in mass transit.&quot; In 1980, the voters of Los Angeles County approved a comprehensive rapid-transit system, with Metro Rail at its core, and taxed themselves to match federal construction funds.    Regarding earthquake safety, which the Journal addresses by noting that the &quot;subway route crosses two potentially active earthquake faults,&quot; the Tokyo, San Francisco and Mexico City subways have easily withstood several earthquakes.    Rail transit can be the most cost-effective mode of carrying passengers in high-ridership corridors. One rail-car operator can transport seven to eight times the number of passengers that one bus operator can. A mix of heavy rail, light rail and bus routes is needed for an efficient transit system.    Alan Cranston, (D., Calif.)   Chairman, Senate Subcommittee   on Housing andamp; Urban Affairs   Pete Wilson, (R., Calif.)   Senate Committee on Commerce,   Science andamp; Transportation   Glenn M. Anderson, (D., Calif.)   House Committee on Public   Works andamp; Transportation   Washington   ---   Your editorial claims that Congress passed major transit reauthorization legislation &quot;without a single public hearing ever being held.&quot; In fact, hearings on that measure began in 1983 and testimony from every conceivable group, both pro and con, covers upward to 7,000 pages of Government Printing Office documents.    The Journal, apparently not enamored with the Los Angeles subway project, claims that &quot;alternatives {to the subway} are precisely what impatient L.A. officials don't want to study.&quot; In fact, Job himself never exhibited more patience than the citizens of Los Angeles, who have endured 30 years of rigorous legislative, environmental and alternative analysis studies before a single shovelful of dirt was turned. The subway option was approved by the UMTA from a list of 11 alternatives.    We in the transit industry are proud to say that America is witnessing a renaissance in public transit. Indeed, North America is enjoying its greatest period of transit development since the turn of the century. Transit is now a $15 billion-a-year enterprise producing more than $45 billion in business revenue.    Jack R.
