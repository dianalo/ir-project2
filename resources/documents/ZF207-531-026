Novell claims an installed baseandM;of more than 400,000 operating systems (i.e., servers).andP;  Vendors of PC-basedandM;dedicated publishing programs support Novell almost exclusively.andM;There are good reasons for Novell's success.andP;  It offers a network operatingandM;system that delivers good performance, a high level of functionality, goodandM;compatibility with MS-DOS applications (and lately, with Mac applications),andM;broad distribution and technical support, and a small army of third-partyandM;product developers selling value-added products.andM;NetWare offer most of the features of the better Unix networks (e.g.,andM;remote procedure calls for distributed processing) and qualifies as a real,andM;&quot;industrial strength&quot; network operating system.andP;  In our opinion, it certainlyandM;is powerful enough to form the foundation for a robust publishing system.andM;Our worries about Novell center on how successfully it will meet theandM;challenge of LAN Manager in the months ahead.andP;  Novell has been the preeminentandM;network vendor for a long time, and has occasionally shown signs of corporateandM;arteriosclerosis; we sometimes wonder if the company remembers how to be leanandM;and aggressive.andP;  We believe that Novell is in for a gloves-off fight againstandM;Microsoft and 3Com, with the outcome far from certain.andM;NetWare's performance The principal reason Novell has become the leader in PCandM;network operating systems is performance.andP;  NetWare has longandM;been the fastest of the networks and it has offered the highest level ofandM;functionality.andP;  NetWare takes less workstation memory than the othernetworks-aandM;critical advantage in the publishing industry.andP;  (Several vendors of PC-basedandM;professional typesetting software support only NetWare.) Perhaps asimportant,andM;Novell has created an environment in which third-party developers could offerandM;niche products for the Novell network.andP;  These developers have become some ofandM;Novell's best evangelists.andM;Specs.andP;  NetWare's specifications place it firmly among the &quot;industrialandM;strength&quot; networks.andP;  Each server can support up to * 100 users;andM;* 2,000 MB of disk space; andandM;* 1,000 files open at a time.andP;  In addition to locking the filesandM;that are open at any given time, NetWare can set file locksandM;on any number of additional files that an application programandM;might request.andM;A Novell network can be connected with Ethernet, TokenandM;Ring, ArcNet, EtherTalk or LocatTalk wiring.andP;  Most makers of networkinterfaceandM;cards provide a Novell driver for their hardware.andM;Proprietary vs.andP;  open.andP;  NetWare is a proprietary operating system.andP;  (NovellisandM;touchy about this and prefers to call it a &quot;special-purpose&quot; operatingsystem,andM;pointing out that the term &quot;proprietary&quot; simply means it is somebody'sandM;property, which all operating systems are.) Unlike 3Com's 3 + server, whichandM;runs under a modified version of MS-DOS, NetWare was designed from the groundandM;up to be maximally efficient as the operating system for a file server.andP;  As aresult, it does not suffer    from the limitations of MS-DOS, such as theinfamous 32-MB disk limit.andP;  It use sandM;relatively large disk sectors (4,096 bytes, versus 512 bytes for MS-DOS) andandM;caches as many sectors as memory will allow.andP;  When the server has to stack upandM;disk access requests because they are arriving faster than they can beandM;satisfied, rather than fulfill them in first-come first-served order, itsortsandM;the requests according to their location on the disk to minimize seek time.andM;By the same token, it is not particularly compatible with any otherandM;operating system.andP;  But it doesn't need to be.andP;  A file server is inherently aandM;&quot;black box'; as long as it stores and retrieves files, you don't really careandM;what happens inside.andM;Novell's original decision to design its own network operating systemandM;from the ground up was a smart one at the time, when the two principalandM;alternatives were Unix and MS-DOS.andP;  Unix running on 8-bit and 16-bit PCs wasandM;prohibitively slow at multitasking, and MS-DOS provided few of the featuresandM;necessary for a world-class network operating system.andM;Novell's implementation provides a lean, multitasking alternative to theandM;DOS-based operating systems.andP;  AN DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, and VMS operatingsystemandM;features are emulated in the NetWare OS, as well as Netbios, which providesandM;peer-to-peer communications capabilities with other Netbios-compatibleandM;applications running under different network operating systems on thenetwork.andM;Being the architect of your own operating system has its advantages.andP;  ForandM;example, Novell designed its own network data-transport protocol called IPXandM;(Internet Protocol Exchange) and workstation file-service redirector shellandM;(NET2, NET3 or NET4, depending on whether it is to interface to MS-DOSversionandM;2, 3 or 4).andP;  IPX and the NET shells are small (50-60K bytes in theworkstation,andM;compared with the 120-400 KB required by DOS-based network operating systems)andM;and fast.andM;Dirty word.andP;  Proprietary has almost become a dirty word lately; the good guysandM;are &quot;open.&quot; Novell points out that, although the NetWare code itself isproprietary, aH of the appli-andM;cation-program interfaces (there are more than 300 system calls) are openlyandM;published and documented so third-party programmers can readily use theandM;functions of the server in their own products.andP;  Vendors who want to developandM;gateways and protocol analyzers can purchase a detailed description of theIPXandM;data packet formats.andP;  Although Novell's IPX protocol is its own, Novell hasandM;published an Open Link Interface that allows network interface hardwaremakersandM;to develop their own equivalent software.andM;In addiction, the company is busily building linkages to other networkingandM;protocols, including TCP/IP and Decnet.andP;  Computer makers can also license theandM;source code to Novell's Portable NetWare, a version of NetWare that wasandM;rewritten to be relatively independent of the host computer hardware  see.andM;Vol.andP;  3., No.andP;  7).andM;NetWare 386.andP;  Novell has also announced its next-generation product-a &quot;LANandM;Manager killer&quot;-NetWare 386.andP;  Designed to be 200-300% faster than 286-basedandM;versions of NetWare, NetWare 386 takes full advantage of the i386'sandM;architecture.andP;  It will support up to 250 nodes per server; up to 32 GBandM;volumes, with 32 physical drives per volume, for a total of 1024 physicalandM;drives per server; 100,000 concurrent open files; more than 2 millionandM;directory entries per volume; a maximum volume size of 32 terabytes, and uptoandM;4 GB of memory per server.andM;NetWare 386 is being designed in a modular way to allow users to addandM;functions to the server platform using server-based applications calledandM;NetWare Loadable Modules.andP;  By designing applications that link into NetWare'sandM;APIs and run as NetWare Loadable Modules (see VAPs and NLMs, below),andM;developers in theory will gain the same benefits from NetWare 386 that theyandM;will get from an OS/2 LAN Manager-based network OS, which was also designedandM;from the ground up to support server-based applications via open APIs.andM;Novell also made a strategic acquisition earlier this year when itandM;acquired Excelan, which makes TCP/IP, OSI, NFS, Netbios, and AFP connectivityandM;products.andP;  Excelan's products should help Novell in its efforts to remain theandM;&quot;network operating system of choice&quot; even in the brave new world ofandM;enterprise-wide connectivity.andP;  One irony of this acquisition is that ExcelanisandM;a licensee of Microsofts LAN Manager, which we believe will be NetWare'smajorandM;competitor in the  90s.andM;Bridges.andP;  Another strength of NetWare is that it is-not tied to anyparticularandM;wiring medium.andP;  Most network interface card makers supply their wares withandM;Novell drivers; some card makers offer only a Novell driver.andP;  Each NovellandM;server can handle up to four network interfaces-four separate wiringandM;schemes-and can bridge between them.andP;  That is, a message packet from onewiringandM;run will automatically be translated into the proper form if it must bepassedandM;along to a receiver that is located on a different wiring run.andP;  It docs notandM;matter whether the PCs are using Ethernet, Token Ring, ArcNet, LocalTalk orandM;another supported medium; the file server makes the logical connectionandM;between these disparate network topologies.andP;  If you need more than four netandM;topologies, you can use multiple file servers.andM;At least one third-party company, Interlan (Boxborough, Massachusetts,andM;phone [508] 263-9929), has a line of products that bridge NetWare servers toandM;other network systems.andP;  It has announced products for TCP/IP and 3 + Open,andM;among others.andM;E-mail.andP;  Novell does not provide its own electronic mail system with NetWare.andM;However, there is an active third-party market in NetWare-compatible mailandM;programs, which means that different users can trade off price and featurestoandM;suit their own needs.andP;  The major shortcoming of working with third-partyandM;options is that few are available that provide all the features we like toseeandM;in an e-mail system.andP;  These include remote access and messaging,andM;store-and-forward between remote locations, conformance with the network'sandM;native naming convention (so aliases can be created for sending broadcastmailandM;messages to a dwpartment or to individuals in remote locations), PC and MacandM;support, and attachment of binary data files.andM;As we have said in the past, we believe that e-mail should be an integralandM;feature of all network operating systems.andP;  3com supports all of theseandM;capabilities in its optional but integral 3 + Mad package.andP;  We like thisandM;feature of 3 + and 3 + Open so much that 3Com's e-mail system has become anandM;indispensable messaging and copy routing tool for our entire organization,andM;including our Associate Editors and offices in Massachusetts and the UK.andM;Novell provides a command-line utility to send short messages (up to 64andM;characters) to other users; there is also a console broadcast facility thatandM;can warn all users of impending system shutdowns and so on.andP;  We don't countandM;these as e-mail services, however, because they can only address users whoareandM;logged in; the store-and-forward function of a true mail system is missing.andM;What Novell does provide  beginning with version 2.15) is a MessageandM;Handling Service.andP;  This software performs much of the work any mall systemmustandM;do: routing table maintenance, global naming conventions, modem control, userandM;lists and so on.andP;  Any mall program that is based on MHS can communicate withandM;any other MHS-based service.andM;A wide variety of MHS-based programs for both PCs and Macintoshes haveandM;been announced.andP;  For example, AshtonTate's Framework Ill supports MHS, asdoesandM;Desqview 2.0.andP;  We have not yet experimented with any MHS e-mail programs, butandM;we are looking forward to doing so.andM;Vaps and NLMS.andP;  We believe that one of the keys to NetWare's success has beenandM;its support for third-party developers who want to add their own server-basedandM;programs that customize NetWare for specific purposes.andP;  In basing their nicheandM;products on NetWare, they become some of Novell's most active boosters andandM;salesmen.andM;in the current product, Advanced NetWare 2.15 (which runs on 286 andandM;386 processors), these server- ased programs are called Value AddedProcesses, or VAPs.andP;  In NetwareandM;386, the same concept is implemented a bit differently, and Novell callsthoseandM;programs NetWare Loadable Modules.andP;  We'll talk about VAPs here, but much oftheandM;following could apply to NLMs as well.andM;Novell implemented its own Macintosh support as a VAP; we'll discuss thatandM;farther along.andM;Novell bundles one VAP, Btrieve, with every copy of NetWare.andP;  Btrieve is aandM;database record manager; it creates, updates and indexes databases, performsandM;searches and retrieves specific records, and automatically resolves multiuserandM;access contention problems.andP;  Because Btrieve runs in the server, the networkandM;traffic relating to database access is held to a minimum-only the specificandM;data that has been requested travels over the net.andP;  In contrast, a PC-basedandM;database program must pull entire index files into the workstation wheneveritandM;needs to perform a search or an update; in the worst case, where there is noandM;index describing the material to be found, the entire database must be copiedandM;over the network.andM;Btrieve is not a database program, for it has no user interface.andM;However, a programmer working in Basic, C, Cobol or Pascal can easily fashionandM;the workstation front-end program (data-entry screen forms, report writersandandM;control logic) to suit the application at hand.andP;  There are also commercialpro-andM;grains (eg., Dataflex) that are based on the Btrieve record manager.andM;Btrieve is similar in purpose to the SQL Server products that areandM;appearing for OS/2 and LAN Manager.andP;  However, Btrieve manages a flat fileandM;system rather than a relational system.andP;  Novell also has SQL products: XQLforandM;the workstation front end and NetWare SQL for the server back-end relationalandM;engine.andP;  NetWare SQL is a VAP that calls on Btrieve to manage the componentandM;files of a relational database.andM;Speed.andP;  How fast is NetWare? Our own network of nine workstations is toosmallandM;to provide a true test of the system's capabilities; we can only say that weandM;have rarely experienced noticeable delays in fetching or storing files.andP;  TheandM;network is about as fast as a local hard disk.andP;  However, because the fileandM;server handles all disk buffering, we have reduced the number of buffers inandM;the workstation to the minimum (by editing the CONFIG.SYS file) and freed upandM;that memory for application programs, which makes these programs run faster.andM;We did have the opportunity to visit a very large NetWare installationandM;recently, however.andP;  Australian Consolidated Press    in Sydney is justputting the finishing touches on a 360-PC publishing systemandM;that is based on a combination of 286 and 386 PCs, NetWare 2.11, 2.12, andandM;2.15, XyWrite, and Ventura Publisher.andP;  We relayed ACP's experiences withandM;Ventura last month.)andM;ACP's system is used to put out more than 20 magazine titles in 3andM;geographic locations.andP;  Each of the 15 servers being used (a 10-MHZ Everex ATandM;clone) supports 20-25 workstations, which are for the most part diskless.andO;(TheandM;workstations running pre-Networked Edition Ventura have hard disks to improveandM;performance.)andM;Opening XyWrite files, copying them around the network, and runningandM;Ventura over the network each generated no appreciable lag even when theandM;network was being heavily utilized.andP;  XyWrite runs entirely in memory, so itandM;generates little network traffic compared to some applications.) The longestandM;delay we observed was in loading Ventura's Networked Edition over thenetwork.andM;It would take up to 45 seconds to load into the workstation and display theandM;cursor, compared with 15-20 seconds from a local hard disk.andP;  Once loaded intoandM;memory, however, we observed little performance degradation compared with theandM;hard-disk-based version.andM;Benchmarks.andP;  Recent articles in Byte and Infoworld have given benchmarks thatandM;are more formal and quantitative than the foregoing observations.andP;  We areandM;particularly interested in the comparisons each magazine did between NetWareandM;and 3 + Open.andP;  Byte, running 3 + Open version 1.0, found it somewhat slowerandM;than NetWare.andP;  Infoworld, running version 1.1, found that it was faster thanandM;NetWare.andP;  This is a very interesting result; no PC-based network has everandM;beaten Novell in speed tests before.andP;  This helps to confirm our impressionthatandM;Novell will have serious competition in the future.andM;However, we caution that both sets of tests, which timed individualandM;server-to-client data-transport tasks, may not reflect the overall throughputandM;of a loaded publishing system on deadline.andP;  We'll have more to say about thisandM;in a future issue, after we've tested 3Com's 3 + Open version of LAN Manager.andM;System integrityandM;Although a file-server-based network architecture has many advantages, it hasandM;one glaring weakness: all your eggs are in one basket.andP;  When (not if theserverandM;fails, all the data stored there becomes inaccessible and may be lostforever.andM;Because the server is such a critical component, NetWare 286 has severalandM;features to enhance the server's reliability and improve the odds of aandM;successful recovery after a crash.andP;  * UPS.andP;  Although a power failure is neverandM;welcome, a failureandM;at the wrong moment (such as when the disk is updating a master directory)andM;can wreak havoc in a computer system.andP;  Novell recommends that the fileandM;server be powered through an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which stepsandM;in to feed the computer from its storage battery as soon as it detects aandM;loss of line power.andM;Although it is up to the user to purchase and install the UPandM;S, theandM;NetWare operating system continually monitors the power-validandM;signal fromandM;the UPS and will perform an orderly system shutdown if commercial power isandM;not restored within a specified period of time.andP;  The shutdown process closesall files, updates all directories and stops all server-andM;based processes, thereby assuring that the file server will be able to start up again with known-good information.andP;  *  Hot fix.andP;  NetWare expects that,over  the fife of the disk,andM;some sectors will go bad.andP;  It reserves a portion of the disk for spareandM;sectors; if a sector goes bad, the software re-maps that sector's address to one of the spares.andP;  *  Write verify.andP;  The operating system always reads backtheandM;disk sector it has just written.andP;  A defective sector is added to the disk'sandM;media-defects list and the write operation is redirected to another sector.andO;*  Duplicate directories.andP;  NetWare maintains a complete duplicateandM;of each disk's file allocation table and directories.andP;  IfandM;an error is detected, the operating system goes to the alternateandM;information, then hot-fixes the damaged directory.andP;  *  Disk mirroring.andP;  Afault-tolerant version, called SFT Net-andM;Ware, is available that supports dual-disk writing.andP;  TwoandM;methods are supported.andP;  The first, called disk mirroring, putsandM;two drives on one controller; the same information is writtenandM;on both drives, one after the other.andP;  If one drive fails, theandM;operating system notifies the system administrator and keepsandM;on going with the remaining drive.andM;A second method uses two complete disk subsystems-drive,andM;controller, power supply-each of which writes the dataandM;independently.andP;  ThisandM;is obviously more expensive and provides a greater degree of protection.andP;  ItandM;also confers a speed advantage during normal use: the operating system canandM;write both disks simultaneously and can read from either disk independently, so it can  be in two places at once.&quot;andP;  *  Transaction backout.andP;  Databaseupdate  operations frequentlyandM;require several disk writes; several data records may have to be changedandM;simultaneously, along with various indexes and pointers.andP;  If the system failsandM;in the middle of such an operation, the database can become inconsistent-anandM;insidious form of corruption because it often cannot be detected.andM;SFT NetWare provides an option called Transaction Tracking SandM;ystem thatandM;remembers an entire sequence of disk updates.andP;  If the systemandM;fails in theandM;middle of the sequence, NetWare is able to &quot;back out&quot; or undo the partiallyandM;completed transaction.andP;  Although the transaction will have to be re-entered,andM;the database is restored to a consistent state.andM;The TIS option is not terribly useful for the text files inandM;aandM;publishing system; it was designed for databases, accounting programs and soandM;forth.andP;  We note, however, that there are many database functions in aandM;complete publishing system-revision history,  deadline tracking costandM;accounting and so on-that would benefit from TIS.andP;  A missing piece.andP;  With allthe care that Novell takes for system reliability, we  are amazed that Novelldoes not currently   provide tape cartridge backup.andP;  We view off-line (andoff-premises) backup as  essential whenever you are staking your livelihoodon a computer system.andP;  Indeed, one of the reasons our Malibu office switchedfrom AppleShare to 3Com's network    was the built-in backup tape andtimed-backup software in theandM;3Com server.andM;However, there is a lively third-party market in tapeandM;backup units.andP;  The ones we have seen are installed in a workstation and backupandM;the server across the network.andP;  They differ not a whit from tape drives thatandM;are sold for standalone PCs  although they must have NetWare-specificandM;software), and provide all the functionality that is needed.andP;  There are alsoaandM;few vendors that sell in-server backup tapes and the VAPs to operate them.andM;SecurityandM;A broad definition of system security would include aH of the data integrityandM;issues we mentioned above, but we will bow to the current usage of the term:andM;keeping unauthorized users out of sensitive information.andP;  Novell has the bestandM;security of any desktop-computer networking system we've seen.andM;We doubt that many publishing installations will need the full strength ofandM;Novell's security system, but almost every system will use some of it.andM;Fortunately, the security system is very simple to use.andM;Login.andP;  To gain access to any server functions, a user must first log in.andM;NetWare allows the system administrator to place specific conditions on whoandM;may log in and under what conditions.andM;* Who.andP;  A user must supply a valid login name.andP;  The administratorandM;can require that aU users have passwords, and can setandM;standards for passwords: minimum number of characters,andM;forced periodic changes, specific expiration dates, etc.andM;* When.andP;  The admin can set specific hours in the week whenandM;a login name is valid.andM;* Where.andP;  A user can be required to log in at a specific workstation.andM;* Intruder alert.andP;  The system can be set to record attempts toandM;log in with an invalid password (or off-hours, or at theandM;wrong station) and can respond to the situation by lockingandM;out all access to an account or a station for a period of time.andM;*  Resources.andP;  The admin can give each user specific limits onandM;how much disk space and computer time he can use.andP;  ThereandM;is also an accounting feature that records the amount of timeandM;and space that has been used, so each user's budget can beandM;charged accordingly.andM;*  Scripts.andP;  The system will automatically execute a login scriptandM;as soon as a user has successfully logged in; the function isandM;similar to the AUTOEXEC.BAT of an MS-DOS system.andP;  In anandM;open environment, the script can provide the convenience ofandM;setting up file access and search paths.andP;  In a security-sensitiveandM;environment, the script can force immediate execution of aandM;program, effectively keeping the entire network invisible toandM;a user.andM;*  Phasers.andP;  One of the login-script commands is  fire phas-andM;ers&quot;; it generates a distinetive sound on the workstation'sandM;speaker.andP;  When we first installed our system, we wereandM;amused.andP;  Later, we realized that, like the bell on a cash register,andM;the unique sound of the phasers can help discourageandM;unauthorized users.andM;Rights.andP;  Even after you have gotten past the login gauntlet, you still don'tandM;have the run of the entire system.andP;  Instead, you have specific access rightstoandM;read, write, create and delete files; to view directory listings and tocreateandM;subdirectories.andP;  These rights can be set separately for each directory andandM;subdirectory in the system.andM;You acquire rights through four mechanisms.andM;*  First, the system supervisor can grant you specific rights toandM;specific directories.andP;  There is also a mechanism for simplyandM;granting you a &quot;security equivalence,' so that you obtainandM;whatever rights some other user currently has.andM;*  Second, you can be made a member of any number ofandM;groups; each group has its own list of rights.andP;  Your effectiveandM;rights in any directory are the sum of your personal rightsandM;and the rights of all the groups you belong to.andP;  Every user isandM;automatically made a member of the group EVERYONE.andM;*  Third, when you move into a subdirectory, you inherit whateverandM;rights you had in the parent directory unless the systemandM;has assigned you specific rights by the first two mechanisms.andM;*  Fourth, the owner of a directory can grant you specific privileges.andM;You are the owner of any directories you have created.andM;It would be nicer, we suppose, to be able to assign specificandM;privileges to individual files in addition to whole directories, as Unix and3andM;+ Open do.andP;  You can, however, mark files for readonly access and can hidethemandM;from directory listings.andP;  For most commercial purposes, we think Novell'sandM;approach to security gives a good measure of flexibility without compromisingandM;safety.andP;  If your data is truly sensitive, it probably doesn't belong on aandM;network at aH.andM;Macintosh integrationandM;Support for Macintoshes goes beyond merely adding drivers for another wiringmedium.andP;  To do the job right requires emu-    lating AppleShare protocols ataU levels of the ISO hierarchy: the AppleShareandM;Filing Protocol, the Name Binding Protocol and so on.andP;  With version 2.15 ofandM;NetWare, Novell has made a good first pass at this.andP;  NetWare supports bothandM;LocalTalk and EtherTalk, and we presume that it will support TokenTalk in theandM;near future.andM;The most important function of Novell's Macintosh support is, of course,andM;the central filing system.andP;  Novell has done a credible job of making thisandM;function work; a Mac user on the network can access any file in the server ifandM;he has the necessary rights.andP;  As far as we can tell, the AppleShareandM;implementation is correct; none of our applications has failed to work withandM;it.andM;As with aU bridges between the Mac and PC worlds, the PCs on the networkandM;will have trouble with the file structure of the Macintosh operating system.andM;The long file names that Macintosh allows are one problem; NetWare copesaboutandM;as well as any system we've seen, and guarantees that the DOSvisible name ofaandM;Mac file will never collide with an existing DOS filename.andM;Another problem is that MS-DOS has no equivalent for the resource fork ofandM;a Mac file- DOS commands operate only on the data fork.andP;  (The best way tothinkandM;of the two forks of a Mac file is to view them as two separate files with theandM;same name.andP;  The data fork is exactly equivalent to a DOS file and can holdanyandM;kind of information; it is up to the application program to know how toandM;interpret the data or how to load and run the executable code.andP;  The resourceandM;fork has a very specific organization and is manipulated only by the MacandM;operating system.andP;  It is commonly used to hold the icons, windows, menus,andM;shading patterns and so on, but it can hold just about any information.andP;  InandM;particular, it holds the executable code of an application program.) PC usersandM;will sometimes sec a file of zero length in their directory listings; theyandM;must be warned not to go deleting such files, which may be Mac programs thatandM;have no data fork.andP;  Novell provides the NDIR and NCOPY utilities, which dotakeandM;account of Mac resource forks, so that DOS users can manage Mac fileseffectively.andP;  Wish fin.andP;  The main improvement we'd like to sec is in thetranslation of DOS  file types to Mac icons.andP;  NetWare currently shows PCfiles with com and EXE  names as applications, and presents all other fileswith the generic DOS  text-file icon.andP;  (Files that a Mac has created on theserver show whatever icon  the Mac gave them.) We'd like to see a moreflexible way to assign icons to DOS  files.andP;  For example, 3Com's 3 + has atable, which the system administrator can  modify at any time, that maps DOSfile extensions to Mac file types and icons.andP;  Problems.andP;  We should also pointout some specific limitations and drawbacks.andP;  * Version 2.15 includes notools for managing the networkandM;from a Macintosh.andP;  To add users, update their rights andandM;group memberships, define printer queues and so on, youandM;must log into the system from a PC.andP;  * Novell's current LocalTalk software isfragile.andP;  Almost anyandM;wiring change-unplugging a LaserWriter, powering on aandM;Telebridge-is liable to interrupt the user's session and breakandM;the logical connection between the file server and the user.andM;At random times during the day, the Mac will beep andandM;complain that the file server &quot;has unexpectedly quit.&quot; NovellandM;says this is due to a bug which has been identified; it will beandM;fixed in the next release, whenever that may be.andM;This is usually not a fatal error, as far as we know; youandM;simply run the Chooser desk accessory and reconnect to theandM;server.andP;  But mostandM;of our Mac testing was with text files, which are usually edited entirely inandM;memory; we did not do any work with transaction-oriented systems likeandM;database entry, accounting, inventory and so on.andP;  Whether fatal or not, it isandM;definitely a damn nuisance.andP;  LocalTalk is supposed to be more robust thanandM;that, and we have never had any such trouble from our 3com or AppleShare systems.andP;  * PCs attached to a Novell server can direct their printingandM;(through the server's print queues) either to a printer driven from one ofthe server's parallel or serial ports or to a Local-andM;Talk printer such as a LaserWriter or Linotype PostScriptandM;device.andP;  Macs can use NetWare's print queues for any of theandM;LocalTalk printers, and can also bypass the server queues andandM;address LocalTalk printers directly.andP;  However, they cannotandM;use the server's queues to address parallel or serial printers.andM;* An error in Novell's documentation makes it seem asandM;though, to run Ethernet to your PCs and EtherTalk to yourandM;Macs, you need two Ethernet interface cards m the server.andM;'Tain't so, and the Mac installation instructions will get fixedandM;in the next release.andM;Most of these shortcomings are typical of first-release software.andM;Simply put, Novell wanted to ship its Mac product as quickly as possible,andM;figuring that a more complete integration could be delivered in a futureandM;version.andP;  Novell officials cannot say when that update will be released, butandM;unofficially led us to expect it right about the end of the year.andM;Battle of the Network StarsandM;Novell came to dominate the PC network market in the  80s by virtue ofandM;imposing order-its order-onto what was a fairly chaotic network scene.andP;  ThisandM;was possible because IBM didn't have a cost-effective alternative to NetWare,andM;and was helped along by the limitations of the various MS-DOS- and Unix-basedandM;alternatives.andP;  In this fight, a network operating system conceived explicitlyandM;for networking and developed outside of the constraints of the otherandM;alternatives--and in the absence of a decisive offering from Big Blue-wasandM;virtually destined to succeed.andM;Enter LAN Manager.andP;  Times are changing, however.andP;  LAN Manager was announcedinandM;1987 as an integral network extension of Microsoft's and IBM'snext-generationandM;PC-based operating system, OS/2, indicating in no uncertain terms that bothandM;companies view workgroup computing as an essential core technology for theandM;next generation of software.andP;  As a consequence, more than 50 companies haveandM;signed on as LAN Manager OEMS.andP;  And since client-server computing is one oftheandM;major benefits promised by LAN Manager, it is highly likely that most oftheseandM;offerings will be 100 percent compatible-something that couldn't be said ofandM;Microsofts previous OEM offering, MS-NETandM;In spite of Novcll's dominant market position, the LAN ManagerandM;announcement put Novell on the defensive for the first time in years.andP;  AfterandM;jumping through several hoops to explain how it could coexist with theandM;proposed new &quot;standard,&quot; Novell said that OS/2 compatibility would beandM;available nonconcurrently with NetWare, requiring a separate coprocessor.andM;Only after howls of protest from the market did it change its tune to saythatandM;OS/2 and its applications would be &quot;fully supported&quot; via a NetWare RequestorandM;for OS/2.andM;In the looming competitive battle with OS/2 LAN Manager (and, for thatandM;matter, with Unix), Novell is now attempting to reinforce its position as theunifying factor for the di-andM;verse architectures that a user will want to support within anenterprise-wideandM;computing environment.andP;  This is a role with which it is both familiar andandM;comfortable, since it is largely the role Novell has played since NetWare'sandM;inception.andP;  In Novell's scenario, there will stiff be the need for a unifyingandM;proprietary solution that provides the common denominator linking together aandM;variety of environments and operating systems.andP;  Hence the development ofandM;Portable NetWare.andM;Microsoft, with OS/2 and LAN Manager, is advocating a visionandM;that is theandM;exact opposite of Novell's.andP;  LAN Manager presupposes that workgroupandM;computingandM;services, such as client-server computing, distributed processing,andM;interprocess links, etc., will be a strategic component of desktop computingandM;in the  90s.andP;  Microsoft maintains that OS/2 and LAN Manager are inseparable,andM;since much of what we today call desktop computing will require integratedandM;network services in the future.andM;If the operating system and the network are inseparable in thandM;e future,andM;Novell's approach of emulating the operating system within its ownandM;proprietaryandM;network environment appears to be out of step with the times.andP;  Novell's bestandM;hope, it would seem, would be for IBM, Microsoft and their OEMs to hangandM;separately rather than together-an argument that was actively espoused to usandM;by NetWare's chief evangelist a year ago.andM;ConclusionandM;All else being equal, it is difficult to see how Novell will survive LANandM;Manager's onslaught over the next several years.andP;  Already there are rumblingsandM;in the trade weekly gossip columns that Novell's troops are facing theandM;prospects of layoffs due to the numbers not adding up.andM;But all else isn't equal.andP;  Novell is sitting on top of a formiandM;dableandM;market share.andP;  It continues to innovate and provide services that enableandM;developers to play quite happily within Novell's ambit.andP;  It is certainlyandM;planning to provide, in NetWare 386, a world-class alternative to LAN ManagerandM;and its derivatives.andP;  Given that OS/2 itself is just getting off the ground,andM;it is entirely possible that a number of developers and users will choose theandM;Novell road to the future, rather than the IBM /Microsoft road.andP;  (An analogyto Compaq and EISA versus  IBM and the Micro Channel comes to mind.)andO;Certainly, a number of publishing  system VARs and developers may continue tochoose this route, if for no other  reason than to preserve their existinginvestments m NetWare-related  developments.andM;Novell's strong points-flexible security administration, robust crash prevention and recovery, high system throughput, plenty of value-added resellers and hordes of satisfied customers-make it nearly unbeatable as the backbone of an office network.andP;  Novell today is the network operating systemof  choice for the majority of publishers and publishing system developers.andM;Novell's weakness, we believe, is that for the first time in years it must face serious competition.andP;  The other network operating systems may have been toothless in the past, but no longer.andP;  Heaven help Novell should it everfalter  in delivering ever-higher levels of functionality or fail to providea painless  upgrade path for its ISVs, for LAN Manager will be waiting in thewings to take  its lunch away.andM;NetWare products Although Novell used to sell fileandM;serversandM;and network interface cards, it has spun most of the hardwareandM;business off toandM;Samsung and is mainly a software house.andP;  The exception is for specializedandM;products for which a third-party market has not yet developed.andP;  All NetWareandM;products require an 80286- or 80386-based PC to be dedicated as a fileandM;server, along with Novell-compatible network interface cards and appropriateandM;cabling.andM;Entry-level systemsandM;ELS NetWare Level I offers a simplified file and print serviceandM;on a single server with up to four users .andP;
