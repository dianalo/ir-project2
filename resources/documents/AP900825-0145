Michael Levine said Clay canceled the show, scheduled forSunday, because ``we feared the possibility that Dice might besubject to arrest, embarrassment and subsequently jailed.''   The promoters of the concert announced Thursday that no oneunder 18 would be admitted _ even with a parent. Dallas CountyAssistant District Attorney David Pickett had said the performancecould violate state obscenity laws.   A woman at Pickett's office said he had left for the day and noone else was authorized to discuss the cancellation.   Larry Fontana, manager of the Starplex Amphitheatre where Claywas to perform, said the cancellation is ``just one of the thingsthat happens in this business.''   He estimated promotion losses would be ``in the lowfive-figures.'' Fontana said 6,000 of 7,000 available tickets weresold at $22.50 each by Friday afternoon. They went on sale July 28.   Clay, whose comedy act includes graphic descriptions of sex,ethnic slurs and descriptions of women as ``whores'' and ``pigs,''said in a statement: ``America is where people have always come forfreedom, and it's a shame that a noisy minority is now attemptingto tear down the right of free speech.''   Members of several local civil rights groups had promised toprotest Clay's appearance. On Monday, the last local sponsor of theconcert, radio station KTXQ-FM, withdrew its support.   Pickett's office has filed nine misdemeanor obscenity chargesagainst the music store chain Sound Warehouse for selling the rapgroup 2 Live Crew's recording, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''   Fontana said Pickett's office placed ``an informational call''to him a few days ago, ``saying citizens groups had contacted them,concerned about the fact that Mr. Clay's material might beobscene.''   Fontana said he didn't take the phone call as a warning.   ``We contacted Clay's people and our attorneys had discussionswith the district attorney's office, but the cancellation wasstraight from Mr. Clay,'' Fontana said.   Earlier this year, ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member Nora Dunnand Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor refused to appear with Clay onthe NBC program. Clay appeared in ``The Adventures of FordFairlane,'' this summer but 20th Century Fox has decided not torelease a planned Clay concert film.</TEXT></DOC>
