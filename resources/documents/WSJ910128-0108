Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B3A</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- In a year that is likely to bringbelt-tightening for many domestic federal agencies, theJustice Department probably will emerge a winner.   Still, the anti-crime initiatives that Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh will announce in coming weeks largely involvereorganizing existing resources, rather than striking out innew directions.</LP><TEXT>   High on President Bush's law-enforcement agenda is an ideathat wouldn't cost anything: expanding the federaldeath-penalty to apply to more crimes. This is almost puresymbolism because many of the offenses involved, such aspolitical assassination and causing train wrecks that resultin death, are extremely rare.   Under the budget for fiscal year 1992 that President Bushwill propose to Congress Feb. 4, the Justice Department wouldreceive more than $10 billion, according to senioradministration officials. That would be an increase of atleast $700 million, or 7.5%, over fiscal 1991, which endsSept. 30.   Congress probably will tinker with the proposal, but itisn't likely to give less money for crime-fighting than theWhite House favors.   The Justice Department will enjoy a &quot;percentage increasesubstantially higher than most other domestic agencies,&quot; saidan administration official. Over the past two years, thedepartment enjoyed a cumulative 39% budget increase, much ofwhich went to prosecuting drug crimes and launching a massiveeffort to expand the prison system.   New Justice Department programs, many of them styled as&quot;pilot projects,&quot; will include the following:                                                                                                          VIOLENT CRIME. Recognizing that many cities are plagued bykillings and other violence not strictly related to drugs,the Department will organize regional task forces with stateand local authorities to target youth gangs and otheroffenders. The administration will continue to opposegun-control legislation, however.                                                                                                          DRUGS. The department will launch a &quot;heartland strategy,&quot;sending additional Federal Bureau of Investigation agents tosuch cities as Omaha, Neb., and Little Rock, Ark. &quot;The bigtrafficking organizations have extended their tentacles toreach these smaller cities,&quot; explains a Justice Departmentofficial. But mayors in cities such as New York and LosAngeles are sure to protest that their problems remain farmore severe but still get inadequate federal attention.                                                                                                          WHITE-COLLAR CRIME. Still smarting from the debate overwho let the savings-and-loan crooks pillage the thriftindustry, the department's criminal division is creating aunit to investigate allegations of widespread fraud withininsurance companies and credit unions.                                                                                                          ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. The Immigration and NaturalizationService, an arm of the Justice Department, will redeploylarge numbers of Border Patrol agents and other personnel to&quot;put more teeth on the {Mexican} border,&quot; an administrationofficial says. Offices farther from the border, some of whichare notoriously mismanaged, will be closed.                                                                                                          JAIL SPACE. The government will build new pre-trialdetention facilities in Philadelphia and other cities toreduce overcrowding. Currently, U.S. marshals are forced totransport detainees as far as 600 miles a day from jail tocourtroom simply to appear at pre-trial hearings.</TEXT></DOC>
