TheARGUS experiment has recently reported evidence for substantial mixingin the B/sub d//sup O/B-bar/sub d//sup O/ system. UA1 has also reportedevidence for mixing, but this cannot be un-ambiguously interpreted toyield a measurement of the amount of mixing in the B/sub s//sup O/B-bar/subs//sup O/ system. The CLEO, Mk. II, and JADE experiments have all reportedupper limits, and the MAC experiment a lower limit, which are compatiblewith the ARGUS and UA1 results.</TEXT></DOC>
