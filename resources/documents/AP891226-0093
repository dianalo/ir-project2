Breeden on Tuesday selected agency veteran William C.McLucas as the SEC's new head of enforcement and announced creationof a new fraud unit covering the sale of securities by financialinstitutions.   McLucas, 39, will succeed Gary Lynch, who resigned as SECdirector of enforcement in July after heading some of the agency'sbiggest insider trading investigations.   The enforcement job, which does not require Senate confirmation,is considered the second most powerful position at the SEC and itis Breeden's first major appointment since President Bush tappedhim as chairman last summer.   McLucas, who has worked in the enforcement division for the past12 years, had been considered one of the front-runners for thepost, but Breeden said he had considered three other SEC attorneysand several persons from outside the agency before making the finalselection.   Breeden said the SEC had decided to create a 25-attorney specialunit to investigate overly aggressive sales of securities bysavings and loans and other financial institutions.   Such sales have been a major focus of congressional hearingsinto the activities at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, theIrvine, Calif.-based Sandamp;L whose failure is expected to be thebiggest in U.S. history, costing taxpayers as much as $2 billion.   Lincoln Savings' parent company is American Continental Corp.,headed by Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. When AmericanContinental filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, it leftshareholders and investors holding nearly worthless stocks andbonds.   Included in this group were some 22,000 small investors whopurchased nearly $200 million in corporate bonds at Lincoln's 29Southern California branches. About two-thirds of these investorswere elderly depositors. At congressionaly hearings, some of theseinvestors testified that they wrongly believed that the bonds theywere purchasing were federally insured.   Breeden said that the new SEC unit would try to prevent otherfinancially troubled Sandamp;Ls from turning to fradulent practices in adesperate effort to raise cash.   ``We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities,they are provided all the necessary information,'' Breeden said.   Lynch, who resigned to join a New York law firm, receivedwidespread praise for a series of big insider trading cases,beginning with the exposure of stockbroker Dennis Levine. Lynchalso spearheaded cases that resulted in a $100 million settlementwith speculator Ivan Boesky and a record $650 million settlement ofa massive civil fraud cause with junk bond-giant Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   In May 1986, the SEC filed charges against Levine, whosecooperation led to Boesky, who in turn implicated Drexel Burnham inthe largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government.   Lynch took over the enforcement division in 1985 at a time ofturmoil after his predecessor, John Fedders, stepped down amidallegations that he beat his wife.   Lynch was credited with restoring morale at the agency. Thescandals in recent years have forced Wall Street's big brokeragehouses to re-evaluate their compliance and ethics codes and ledCongress to increase the penalties for insider trading.   At the news conference, Breeden noted that Congress has boostedthe SEC budget by almost 20 percent this year to $168 million,providing enough new money to hire an additional 100 lawyers.   He said it was important for the SEC to police the securitiesindustry in such a way that individual investors will have renewedconfidence. Individual investors have left the market in droves inrecent years, partly out of fears raised by the huge gyrations instock prices that occurred in October of 1987 and 1989.   During the 1970s, the SEC's enforcement division first gainedattention under Stanley Sporkin for pursuing corporations thatmaintained political slush funds and paid bribes to win overseasbusiness.</TEXT></DOC>
