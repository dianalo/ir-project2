But the court ruled that fathers aren't eligible forsimilar damages.</LP><TEXT>   The 2-to-1 decision by the appeal court in San Diegobroadened the circumstances under which a mother can seek herown compensation for injuries sustained by her child. Whileit is binding only in certain Southern California trialcourts, the court's ruling is expected to be influentialelsewhere.   Previously in California, as in most states, a mothercouldn't demand emotional distress damages for birth-injurymalpractice unless she herself was either physically orpsychologically injured during the baby's delivery. The oldrule usually meant that the mother's injury must haveoccurred while she was still an obstetric patient -- forexample, if she watched her doctor negligently handle hernewborn at the hospital.   Most courts relied on a legal theory that doctors andhospitals can be held liable only to persons to whom theyowed a duty of care. Thus, if a mother wasn't hurt in someway while she was still a patient, then she couldn't ask fordamages in her own behalf.   The case involved a quadriplegic girl whose spine had beendamaged during her birth by an improper Caesarean section atMercy Hospital and Medical Center in San Diego. However, thecause of the child's injury wasn't diagnosed for about twoyears. Her mother, Michelle Anisodon, filed suit seekingdamages on behalf of the child and also to compensate for herown suffering. A trial court dismissed Ms. Anisodon's claim.   The appellate court, in reinstating her lawsuit, notedthat Ms. Anisodon in a sense {was} physically harmed duringdelivery by the faulty incision. But more importantly, themajority reasoned, she could also be considered a &quot;directvictim&quot; of harm because she was part of the mother-and-child&quot;unit&quot; that had come under the hospital's care. As a resultof the appellate ruling, Ms. Anisodon can go back to thetrial court to seek damages.   However, the court declined to accept a similar argumentby the child's father, who was present during labor anddelivery. &quot;He simply doesn't qualify as a patient in jointtreatment to whom particular duties are owed,&quot; wrote JusticeRichard Huffman.   In dismissing the father's claim, the court wrote that&quot;while {his} emotional distress is unquestionably as real andas deep as that of the mother,&quot; he wasn't a direct victim ofharm.   &quot;This decision creates a new category to whom a duty isowed -- a `family unit' that consists of the birthing motherand the child,&quot; said Abby Leibman, a managing director of theCalifornia Women's Law Center, a non-profit organization inLos Angeles. &quot;If a baby is injured during the process ofbirth, the mother as part of that single unit can now becompensated for her own pain,&quot; Ms. Leibman said.   A dissenting judge, Presiding Justice Daniel Kremer,criticized the ruling as a &quot;nearly limitless&quot; extension ofliability. A lawyer for the hospital, Thomas Diachenko,echoed that concern.   &quot;The court's ruling could be interpreted narrowly, toapply only where there's a uterine incision. But if it'sinterpreted broadly to apply to any mother who delivers abirth-injured child, then I suspect we'll be seeing a lotmore mothers coming to court to claim emotional-distressdamages,&quot; said Mr. Diachenko, an associate at the law firmLewis, D'Amato, Brisbois andamp; Bisgaard in San Diego.   He added that the hospital &quot;most likely&quot; would appeal theruling. An attorney for Ms. Anisodon couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   WOMAN WHO TOOK COCAINE while pregnant isn't guilty ofchild abuse.   The ruling by an intermediate appeals court in Florida islikely to be closely read because the state's Supreme Courtwill soon take up the issue of prosecutions of women who takedrugs while pregnant.   The high court will hear the appeal of a ruling fromanother district that upheld the conviction of a womanaccused under another law of delivering drugs to her newbornbaby through the umbilical cord immediately after birth, thefirst such conviction in the nation.   The District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida,fourth district, in West Palm Beach, ruled last week thatCassandra Gethers, who was accused of taking cocaine whilepregnant, couldn't be charged with child abuse under statelaw. Ms. Gethers put the child up for adoption.   In upholding a lower court decision, the court noted thatbefore Florida's child abuse statute had been enacted, aclause citing &quot;injury sustained by a newborn infant as aresult of being born drug dependent&quot; was removed from thebill and replaced with &quot;physical dependency of a newborninfant upon any drug.&quot;   An assistant attorney general, Sarah Mayer, said the stateprobably wouldn't appeal. She predicted that in the future,if pregnant women who take drugs are prosecuted in Florida,they will be charged with delivering drugs to their newbornchildren through the umbilical cord, unless the state SupremeCourt rules otherwise.   Calling the problem a &quot;tough issue,&quot; she said, &quot;We keephaving these babies born, the neonatal costs are phenomenal .. . the state is picking up the tab.&quot;   Ms. Gethers's attorney couldn't be reached. Charles M.Auslander, an attorney in Miami for the American CivilLiberties Union who filed a friend-of-the court brief on Ms.Gethers's behalf, hailed the decision as &quot;the first appealscourt {ruling} in the state to agree with the position of theACLU and defense counsel that this isn't the proper place forcriminal law to be.&quot;   Lynn Paltrow, who represents the ACLU in the case pendingbefore the Florida Supreme Court, said that between 80 and100 women have been arrested nationwide since 1986 on variouscharges because they took drugs while pregnant. She said thewoman have prevailed in all but one of the 15 &quot;explicitchallenges&quot; to the prosecutions.   &quot;The problem in this country is that there {aren't} enoughsubstance abuse programs for the women who want it,&quot; Ms.Paltrow said.   ---   LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERS EPA clean-up costs, Iowa courtrules.   The decision by the Iowa Supreme Court came in a disputebetween a brass foundry in Dubuque and 14 insurers over whowould pay for clean-up costs resulting from claims madeagainst the company by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency. It was the first time Iowa's high court had addressedthe issue.   In ruling that the clean-up costs were covered bycomprehensive general liability policies, the court ruled infavor of A.Y. McDonald Industries Inc., which runs thefoundry. The court joined a growing number of states thathave rejected insurance company arguments against holdingthem responsible for policy holders' federally mandatedclean-up costs.   Although at most only several million dollars were atstake in the McDonald case, it was closely watched byattorneys for policy holders and insurers who are locked indisputes nationwide over who will pay for EPA clean-ups. Itis estimated that more than $500 billion will eventually bespent on environmental clean-ups.   Environmental lawyers say that at least seven statesupreme courts have now accepted the arguments of policyholders in cases involving coverage in government-mandatedclean-ups, and only two have ruled in favor of insurancecompanies. Such decisions have no direct bearing outsidetheir jurisdiction, but as momentum builds on one side of anargument, high courts yet to consider the issue are morelikely to accept the popular position.   Nonetheless, a spokesman for the Fireman's Fund InsuranceCo. of Novato, Calif., the parent of two of the insurersnamed in the suit, didn't think the Iowa ruling marked amajor loss. &quot;On this issue the case law is all across theboard,&quot; said Peter A. Lefkin, vice president of governmentand industry for Fireman's Fund, a unit of Fund American Cos.&quot;There's no consistent logic. So you try your best every timeand hope you win.&quot;   ---   REQUEST FOR GOVERNOR'S phone records is rejected byVirginia court.   The Daily Progress, a Charlottesville, Va., newspaper,wanted access to the itemized long-distance phone bills ofthe office of Gov. Douglas Wilder. But the Virginia SupremeCourt ruled that the records were protected by the state'sFreedom of Information Act, which denies access to memos,working papers and correspondence held by the office of thegovernor.   The court said that the bills could be used to reconstructthe activities of the governor's office, which should beprivileged information. The court also noted that therecipients of the calls could be subjected to intrusiveinquiries.   Earlier this month, Gov. Wilder announced his candidacyfor the Democratic nomination for president.   Craig Nesbit, the Daily Progress's executive editor, saidhe is concerned about the ruling's impact on theaccountability of public officials. &quot;The court is morewilling to stand on the side of a politician's ability toconduct public business in secret than for the public's rightto know what its government is doing,&quot; he said.   The newspaper, which has about 33,000 readers, is owned byWorrell Enterprises Inc. of Deerfield Beach, Fla.   According to Mr. Nesbit, the paper first sought the phonerecords under the state's Freedom of Information Act in thespring of 1990 &quot;in a routine look at expenses of thegovernor's office.&quot; After the governor denied the request, acircuit court judge ruled that the newspaper should haveaccess because phone bills are not part of a category ofrecords legally protected from public scrutiny. The governorthen appealed to the state's highest court.   Richard D. Taylor, special assistant to Gov. Wilder, saidaccess to the billings &quot;would have had a chilling effect onthe governor's ability to do his job.&quot; The right of thegovernor and his staff to make their phone calls privately&quot;far outweighs a mere curiosity over who the governor may becalling.&quot;   Mr. Nesbit said the newspaper has no plans at this time topursue the issue. &quot;What we can hope for is that another goodcase will come along that will effectively overturn thisdecision.&quot;   ---   NOTED: John J.
