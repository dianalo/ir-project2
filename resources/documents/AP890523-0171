(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Controversial claims of room-temperaturefusion were discounted or found only qualified support Tuesdayamong scientists presenting the results of their own experiments atan international workshop Tuesday.   Physicists and chemists from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory rejected confirmationof room-temperature nuclear fusion reported by the University ofUtah exactly two months ago.   Utah electrochemist Stanley Pons and British colleague MartinFleischmann startled the scientific world with the announcementthey had achieved cold fusion in a simple experiment involvingelectrodes of the metal palladium and water made with deuterium, aheavy isotope of hydrogen.   The conventional belief was that fusion as an energy sourcewould only be attained at high temperatures and by applying highpower.   MIT chemist Richard Crooks told the estimated 500 participantsthat, after conducting experiments similar to the Fleischmann-Ponswork, none of the telltale signs of fusion _ including excess heat,the tritium isotope of hydrogen and neutron radiation _ were found.   ``The evidence of fusion products is much too small to accountfor fusion,'' said Crooks.   Later, he told reporters that there is ``no evidence nuclearprocesses are going on.''   ``There's always room for something new and unanticipated. Youalways keep your eye out for that,'' said Crooks.   He also took a swipe at Pons' and Fleischmann's researchmethods, saying they have had to back down on some of theirassertions.   ``We're getting back into the realm of really good science andout of the realm of quick and dirty experiments,'' he said.   MIT plasma fusion researcher Stanley Luckhardt said he does notbelieve anyone at the conference will turn up the definitive proofof cold fusion.   ``I think we would have heard it in the halls,'' he said.   Luckhardt said the problem is that researchers have measuredheat in some experiments and a small amount of fusion byproducts inothers, but no one has managed to find both heat and particles.   The closest thing to confirmation of the Pons-Fleischmannfindings came from Texas Aandamp;M University chemist John Appleby, whoreported finding sizeable amounts of tritium in Texas Aandamp;Mexperiments.   Appleby said at a news conference that ``tritium can be comingonly from fusion. That is the bottom line.''   During a presentation opening the three-day workshop, Applebysaid his research turned up evidence of what he called ``anomalousheat.''   He described a series of experiments using different forms ofthe metal palladium and different solutions, some including lithiumand sodium, which yielded varying results.   In a solution of lithium and deuterium, he said, ``an anomalouseffect takes place.''   Aandamp;M scientist Kevin Wolf told the assembly that separate teststurned up evidence that a small number of neutrons and largeramounts of tritium had been released in Texas experiments similarto those conducted by Pons and Fleischmann.   Wolf said the number of neutrons produced was up to seven timesthe number expected in nature.   Appleby said that since little is known about the fusionoccurring within the structure of a metal, there may be reactionstaking place that are unknown.   Appleby said he was disappointed but not surprised that the Aandamp;Mexperiments did not find the presence of helium 3, a product of thefusion of two heavy hydrogen atoms.   He said it would be given off at a very low level, not enough tobe detected.   Appleby also said that if the amount of deuterium that has toinfiltrate the palladium electrodes is crucial, then scientistsusing small palladium wires _ such as used by Aandamp;M _ should expectto see results more quickly than researchers using large bars orrods of palladium.</TEXT></DOC>
