Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7435 marks, down a bitfrom 1.7493 marks Monday.   The mark didn't stray far from a trading range of 78 yento 78.50 yen on Monday as dealers in Asia first bought theGerman currency, lifting it to 78.53 yen. The market thenturned around and took profits, pushing the mark to 78.15 yenaround the time European markets quit trading. The mark roseagain during the North American afternoon and was quoted inlate New York trading at 78.32 yen, up from 78.28 yen Friday.   The dollar lacked economic indicators or political news topropel it, leaving the field to technical charts, whichplaced its support parameters at 1.7475 marks and 1.7535marks and which are mildly positive, said David Stillings, anassistant vice president at Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank inNew York.   The dollar also is hemmed in between 136.50 yen and 137.50yen. It is expected to stay in its narrow ranges until atleast tomorrow, when the first revision of the second-quarterU.S. gross national product is scheduled to be announced,said Nori Kato, a New York trader with Industrial Bank ofJapan. Second-quarter GNP originally was reported to haverisen 0.4%, which if confirmed would mark the end of the U.S.recession.   The dollar received slight support from continuing strifein Yugoslavia, on the theory that instability in EasternEurope makes the U.S. currency a more attractive investmentthan the mark and other major European currencies. Butholidays in Hong Kong and Britain sapped activity, andplayers used the dull market as an excuse not to trade.   Dealers said the market is bedraggled after the sharpfluctuations caused by the unsuccessful coup in the SovietUnion last week. &quot;A lot of people got hurt&quot; when the dollarshot higher on news of the coup then plunged as it failed,said Jack Annunziato, a corporate adviser at Pru-Bache ForexU.S.A. in New York.   The dollar soared 3.4% against the mark Aug. 19 on wordthat Communist hard-liners had ousted President MikhailGorbachev. But investor skittishness and concerted centralbank intervention halted the climb at an intraday peak of1.8320 marks, well off the year's high of 1.8427 marks setJuly 5.   Last Wednesday, when it became clear the coup wascrumbling, the dollar plunged, reaching an intraday low of1.7345 marks and ending North American dealings at levelsbelow those on Aug. 16, the Friday before the coup.   Mr. Stillings said European players were still buying thedollar yesterday, albeit with caution. &quot;A lot of Europeancustomers are saying the Soviet situation is still very muchon their mind,&quot; Mr. Stillings said. &quot;They still say there aremore problems below the surface, so they're buying dollarsquietly.&quot;   He said U.S. dealers, by contrast, appear to be moreinterested in U.S. economic fundamentals, which remain murkydespite a bullish report Friday on July durable goods orders.   The dollar was propped up by the report of a surprising10.7% surge in durable goods orders in July from June. Thedata &quot;caught a lot of people off guard,&quot; said Mr. Stillings.   The market had sold dollars in anticipation of a modest1.5% gain in orders, he said. The number reported by theCommerce Department instead sent the dollar up two pfennigsagainst the mark within five minutes.   Some market-watchers, however, suggest that the durablegoods data might have overstated the economy's strength, asthe figures are volatile and subject to sharp revision.Tomorrow's first revision of second-quarter GNP, they say,could provide some insight into whether the U.S. FederalReserve will cut interest rates further.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $355.20 an ounce, up $1.80. Estimatedvolume was a very light 600,000 ounces.   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $355.45 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
