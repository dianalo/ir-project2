(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tugboat crewman Tom Scott knew the creditcard call to his wife from New York via a marine-telephone linkupwouldn't be cheap.   But his bill, all 244 pages of it, totaled $11,178.84.   ``I about fell on the floor,'' Scott said. ``I couldn't believeit at first. It's thick as a telephone book. Then I realized what itwas.''   He had used his calling card, reading the number over the boat'sradio to the marine operator.   ``Evidently someone had some ears and picked up on it,'' he said.   Scott thinks whoever heard the number on the airwaves quicklysold it or allowed friends to use it. All the calls on the bill werefrom New York City, but they were to numbers as far away as Miami,Strasburg, Mo., and Mexico City.   The ATandamp;T security office called Scott right after it happened andasked if he used his card often, Scott said.   ``I said, well, not really, maybe two or three times,'' herecalled. ``They said like 48 times in one hour.''   Scott said most of the calls were charged through NationalTelephone Service in Texas, which he said would get stuck with thebill.   Meantime, Scott says he will pay one two-minute call _ theoriginal call to his wife from New York.   ``That was about $4,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
