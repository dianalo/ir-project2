Local news reports said Takeshita and Ito, a former foreignminister, are at odds over Ito's call for an end to party factions.Ito, in naming his terms for leading the scandal-tainted party andbecoming Japan's next prime minister, also has demanded theresignations of all party officials connected to corruption cases.   After meeting more than three hours today, the two LiberalDemocratic Party leaders said their discussions focused on reformof the party, whose popular support has been deeply eroded by theso-called Recruit scandal.   ``My feeling has not changed,'' Ito said. ``I believe Mr.Takeshita hasn't got a good impression'' of the conditions underwhich he would accept the country's top post.   Though Takeshita was expected to ask Ito to accept the partypresidency, he told reporters after the meeting: ``We enteredtoday's talks after confirming between each other that I'm not in aposition to make any request today.''   Takeshita leads the largest of six major factions that make upthe Liberal Democratic Party. Balancing factional strength is animportant factor in determining appointments to the Cabinet and hasbecome a widely accepted feature of the ruling party organization.Political fundraising _ a key issue in the current scandal _ is amajor part of factional competition.   The discredited prime minister has admitted receiving more than$1 million in donations from the information conglomerate RecruitCo. and announced April 25 he will resign to take responsibilityfor the loss of public trust.   ``Revolutionary changes in the party's way of thinking areneeded,'' Itotold reporters Tuesday.   Ito, 75 and diabetic, has rejected a series of informal offersto replace Takeshita, citing his age and poor health. But partyleaders appear ready to negotiate with him because he is one of ahandful of senior politicians untainted by the scandal, which alsoinvolved insider trading.   Three of Takeshita's Cabinet ministers have resigned and 14businessmen and ex-bureaucrats have been arrested for bribery orother charges related to the affair.</TEXT></DOC>
