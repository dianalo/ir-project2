The skirmishing erupted Monday after the president unveiledplans for a permanent ban on imports of many semiautomatic assaultweapons and a ban on the manufacture of ammunition magazines forthose guns containing more than 15 rounds.   The proposal is part of a $1.2 billion anti-crime package thatalso calls for building new prisons, hiring more federal agents,widening the death penalty and toughening sentences for illegallyusing semiautomatic guns.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh defended the program today on``CBS This Morning,'' saying, ``I think it represents a veryimportant tangible commitment to law enforcement. The war on crimeis no longer rhetorical ... In the street language, if you can't dothe time, don't do the crime.''   ``There'll be a systemwide approach,'' Thornburgh said. ``Thatmeans more agents to investigate crimes, more prosecutors toprosecute them, and most importantly, the jails to accommodatethose who have been convicted of serious violent crimes.''   The National Rifle Association of America, the nation's largestgun lobby, fired one of the first volleys at the president'sgun-control plan.   ``We don't see a heck of a difference between a 15-roundmagazine and three five-round magazines other than about the twoseconds it takes to change from one to another,'' said James Baker,the NRA's chief lobbyist in Washington. ``That's not going to havean effect on criminals.''   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, sponsor of broader restrictionson semiautomatic weapons, said he was ``disappointed that thepresident chose to limit his action'' to foreign-made guns, whichaccount for only about 25 percent of U.S. sales.   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the SenateJudiciary Committee, also questioned why Bush did not propose torestrict domestically manufactured military-style assault weapons.   ``If it makes sense to ban the importation of assault weapons,why doesn't it make sense to ban similar weapons made here in theUnited States?'' Biden asked.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Bush's assault-weapon proposals``don't do enough to protect police officers who are going againstthese weapons in urban battle zones.''   Meanwhile, the head of a gun-owners group angrily denounced theproposal as a ``back-door attempt to ban handguns in the name ofcuring the assault rifle problem.''   ``If George Bush thinks that American gun owners and otherclear-thinking Americans will accept this public relations stuntand drop the pressure on him, the president is sadly mistaken,''said Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America.   The 15-round limit on ammunition magazines would also apply tosemiautomatic handguns, many of which are made overseas, said aJustice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The proposal comes amid studies showing that semiautomaticrifles are being used more often in the commission of crimes.Public furor erupted in January after five children were killed ina Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunman using a Soviet-styleAK-47 assault rifle.   Speaking in the rain outside the U.S. Capitol to relatives of161 police officers killed last year, Bush vowed to ``take back thestreets'' from violent criminals with tougher enforcement andstiffer penalties.   Bush said he would make permanent his two-month-old temporaryban on importing semiautomatic assault weapons that are not usedfor sporting purposes.   Bush said that most guns are ``legitimately owned for legitimatepurposes,'' but that ``the right to own guns is not a license toharm others.''   ``There is substantial controversy and debate,'' Bush said.``But one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is thatthey invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines,''he said, explaining his proposal to limit magazines to 15 rounds.   Bush also proposed doubling the mandatory sentence for using asemiautomatic firearm during commission of a violent crime or drugfelony, from five to 10 years.   The president's plan also would revive the death penalty forespionage, treason and a wide range of murders by amending existingfederal laws to conform to Supreme Court standards for capitalpunishment.   Besides reviving those death penalty provisions that have falleninto disuse since high-court rulings of the 1970s, the proposalwould provide capital punishment for a number of other murders,including killings committed for hire, homicides by federalprisoners serving life sentences and by terrorists.   The president also sought an extra $1 billion to build an extra24,000 beds in the nation's federal prison system, which now holds48,000 inmates.   The plan also calls for spending an additional $50.3 million tohire 825 federal agents at the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms and the U.S. Marshals Service.   Another $49.6 million would be spent to hire an additional 1,600federal prosecutors.   Civil libertarians are likely to oppose Bush's other proposalsto limit access to the federal courts for state prisonerschallenging criminal convictions, and for a ``good-faith''exception to the rule that excludes improperly seized evidence fromcourt.</TEXT></DOC>
