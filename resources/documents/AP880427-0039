It was the first time in South Korea's 40-year history that thegoverning party has lost its majority in the National Assembly.   The voting was marred by violent protests. No deaths werereported but newspapers said three policemen were injured asdemonstrators protested alleged vote rigging in cities throughoutthe country.   Final official returns indicated that 166 candidates from threeopposition parties were assured of seats. Independents won 10seats, and Roh's Democratic Justice Party won 123 seats, the mostby a single party.   There are 299 seats in the assembly, but only 224 were up forelection from single-member districts. The other 75 seats areallotted according to the proportion of votes each party received.Winners will serve four-year terms.   The Democratic Justice Party had 160 seats in the outgoing276-seat assembly, which was expanded in size by a new constitution.   Roh, who appeared disappointed, said the election ``has leftmany things for us to think deeply about, but I would humbly acceptthe outcome and do my best to fulfill my promise to the people.''   Kim Dae-jung's opposition Party for Peace and Democracy defeatedKim Young-sam's opposition Reunification Democratic Party in thebattle for the No. 2 spot. The Party for Peace won 73 seats,compared to 58 for Runification.   The New Democratic Republicans, an opposition party led by KimJong-pil, a former prime minister, won 35 seats in the new assembly.   Democratic Justice had been expected to maintain its control ofthe legislature because of divisions among the opposition parties.   Opposition control of the assembly will have added impact undera new constitution that took effect in February, when Roh started afive-year term after winning office in December balloting with 36percent of the vote.   Under the constitution adopted after anti-governmentdemonstrations last summer, the president no longer can dissolvethe National Assembly.   Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam split the opposition vote in lastyear's presidential elections when both ran as presidentialcandidates.   Many of those taking part in demonstrations Tuesday wereprotesting a report a day earlier by a television station thatDemocratic Justice candidate Hyun Kyung-dae had won a seat onsouthern Cheju Island with 39 percent of the vote.   The station, part of the MBC network, said the reportaccidentally went on the air during a rehearsal for Tuesday'selection coverage.   The station apologized to the nation and said two employees hadbeen fired and four suspended. Prosecutors said they wereinvestigating to determine if election laws had been violated.   Opposition parties claimed the broadcast showed that thegovernment had manipuated vote-counting computers before anyballots were cast.   In the actual count Tuesday, Hyun led at first but then trailed.   Cheju news reports said an estimated 1,000 people demonstratedafter the polls closed, shouting ``Nullify the elections!''   Yonhap said that earlier in the day, 600 protesters attacked apolling station and then used firebombs in an attack on a mobilebroadcasting unit of KBS, which temporarily went off the air inCheju.   The agency said three policemen were injured and a police vanwas burned as riot squads fired tear gas at the demonstrators.   There were these reports of violent protests in other cities:   About 300 students staged hit-and-run protests in downtownSeoul. Several hundred students battled police near Seoul's YonseiUniversity.   In Kwangju, Kim Dae-jung's southern political base, an estimated1,500 students jeered police guarding polling stations. In nearyMockpo, about 500 people crowded the downtown streets in ananti-government protest.   News reports said the demonstrations had subsided by midnight.   Two election-related deaths were reported.   Lee Kwang-ho, a 21-year-old campaigner for the ReunificationDemocratic Party, killed himself by pouring gasoline over his bodyand lighting it during an argument with supporters of Roh's partyin the southern city of Woekwan.   On Friday, a district official perished during a scuffle with afellow Democratic Justice Party supporter.   Korean newspapers reported two opposition campaigners were incritical condition after being stabbed near their party office byunknown assailants in Hwasoon, another southern city.   Officials estimated that 72.6 percent of the 26.2 millionregistered voters cast ballots, down from 89.2 percent in theDecember presidential election.   It was the lowest turnout since 72.1 percent voted in NationalAssembly elections in 1963.</TEXT></DOC>
