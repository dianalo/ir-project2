The report updates preliminary figures on what thegovernment paid outside lawyers to do work for the FDIC'sBank Insurance Fund, which takes over failed banks, and theResolution Trust Corp., which deals with failed thrifts. Thegovernment uses outside lawyers to file suits against formerofficers, accountants and lawyers of defunct institutions, aswell as to handle foreclosures, title searches and propertysales.</LP><TEXT>   Alfred Byrne, the FDIC's general counsel, said the agencyhopes to reduce slightly its payments to outside law firms to$600 million this year as the government does more of its ownwork. The FDIC's legal staff will grow to 1,500 from 1,035 in1991, he said.   The FDIC plans to issue today a policy designed to spreadthe agency's legal work more widely among private firms. Thepolicy will seek, among other things, to keep a single firmfrom receiving more than $7.5 million annually. The agencynegotiates with firms contracts that require minimumdiscounts of 20% from normal rates.   Last year, the Chicago firm of Hopkins andamp; Sutter collected$17.5 million in fees from the FDIC; Graham andamp; James in SanFrancisco got $9.1 million; and Arter andamp; Hadden in Clevelandreceived $7.7 million, according to the FDIC. Earlier figureson payments to outside firms combined 1990 payments with feespaid for work in earlier years and thus showed higher totalsfor some firms.</TEXT></DOC>
