400 pound sterling (Slideworksplus Presentation Assistant)andM;* PC USER VERDICT  An easy to use package with limited functionality but it'sable to provide high quality results, especially when used for inpust to theimaging service.andM;PC-Slide consists of a series of modules at the centre of which sitsSlideworks.andP;  It provides the ability to design high-quality, high-resolution35mm colour slides with the PC.andP;  The emphasis is on quick and easypreparation of business graphics - with output that can be transmitted usinga modem (or sent through the post on disk) to the Presentation Expres imagingbureau for processing into 35mm slides, overhead transparencies or prints.andM;The installation process is as automatic as possible, and works well, as longas your system matches the assumptions of A: for the original disk and C: forthe destination directory.andP;  PC-Slides also insists on copying the DOS masterdisk into the C: DOS directory.andM;The documentation for Slideworks is complete and extensive.andP;  The tutorialconsists of a working session that leads step by step through the designprocess.andP;  Most actions revolve around forms presented, with appropriatedefaults ready set, for data entry.andP;  The slide itself can be viewed at anytime in pictorial form.andM;PC-Slide operates with a palette of 256 colours, so it's ideally run on a VGAcolour monitor.andP;  The program begins with a main menu which offers choices ofdesign slide, output slide, transfer slide or exit to DOS.andM;Design slide offers in its turn, text, pie chart and bar/line chart.andP;  Oncethe appropriate choices have been made and the six-character slide nameentered, the appropriate form is displayed.andP;  For text slides, this specifiesthe background colour, font style, shadow effect, size and colours for titlesand body.andP;  Seven fonts are offered in the base product and national languagecharacters are well supported.andP;  The next form allows you to enter the actualtext of the titles and other lines.andP;  Alternatively, you can input text that'salready been created and converted to ASCII.andM;At this stage you can finally elect to view the slide.andP;  The screen is dividedinto three parts.andP;  The slide itself is displayed in a frame andcharacteristics of the slide contents are displayed alongside, withadditional information and a command list below.andM;Selecting the Output option allows the slide to be formatted for theparticular graphics adaptor insalled, in this case, a VGA.andP;  This takes a fewmoments and produces a very effective image.andP;  However, most of the time youview the slide in a pictorial, half-finished format, with lower resolutionand incomplete imaging.andM;The pie chart slide operates similarly.andP;  The main form adds columns for datavalues, colours and legends.andP;  Data values are limited to four figures, so youmay need to round values, and there can be up to ten slices.andP;  Colours can bespecified by name (eight colours only) or by number (256 different colours).andO;The pie chart can be viewed at any time, with a pictorial representation plusdetails of slice percentages and the various settings selected.andM;The main form for bar/line chart slides has the graph type, frame, grid andcolours.andP;  Bar charts can be vertical or horizontal and stacked orcomparative, while line charts can be regular, bar or step format.andP;  The datafor up to six bars or lines can be entered, with 20 values for each on theform.andP;  Additional forms can be defined, to give up to 62 points on a line.andO;Data values can have up to nine digits.andM;Slideworks is unashamedly limited in functionality.andP;  Its strength lies in itsease of use, quality fonts and colour palettes designed for use withhigh-resolution  film recorders.andP;  In fact, Slide Express, which distributesPC-Slide products in the UK, offers its custom slide production service for arange of presentation graphics products, including Freelance, Graphwriter,Harvard Graphics and Draw Applause.andP;  PC-Slide is recommended where users wantto obtain production shop quality with minimum of in-house expertise.andP;  Thecosts for producing a slide is 6 pound sterling, with 24-hour turnaround.andO;The first five slides are free.andM;Presentation Assistant extends the image library, adds 24 type faces andprovides support for the Apple LaserWriter (or other PostScript printers),the HP PaintJet and the Calcomp plotter.andP;  This module can't be used withoutthe base Slideworks and, at the price, shouldn't be considred essential.andM;The other modules in PC-Slide, the Imager and the Manager, are intended forthe 35mm slide production studio, and add support for thermal transferprinters, film recorders and video output as well as conversion betweendifferent graphics files.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
