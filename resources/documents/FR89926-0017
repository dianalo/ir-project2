Although the additive itself has notbeen found to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amountsof aniline and 4-aminobiphenyl (4/ABP) as impurities carried through theproduction process and minute amounts of quinoline as a byproduct impurityof its production. These chemicals have been shown to cause cancer in testanimals. Residual amounts of reactants, byproducts, and impurities, suchas aniline, 4-ABP, and quinoline, are commonly found as contaminants inchemical products, including food additives.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety</ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.4 (1958).) This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act(21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shallbe deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by manor animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve a use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain a carcinogenicchemical but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer.In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis. An additive that has not been shown to causecancer, but that contains a carcinogenic impurity, may properly be evaluatedunder the general safety clause of the statute using risk assessment proceduresto determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm willresult from the proposed use of the additive.The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott</T3> v. <T3>FDA,</T3> 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic impurity but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejectedthe challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use of the Additives</ITAG>The agency estimated the daily intake of styrenated diphenylamine in adhesivesand rubber articles intended for repeated food-contact use based on severalfactors, including an analysis of several product applications and theprobable concentration of the additive in food-contact articles and rubberarticles for repeated use. The agency found that these uses will resultin an extremely low level of exposure to this additive.FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in very low exposure levels(Refs. 1 and 2), and the agency has not required such testing in this case.However, the agency has reviewed available data from an acute toxicitystudy on styrenated diphenylamine in the rat. No adverse effects were reportedin this study. Because the additive itself has not been shown to causecancer, the anticancer clause does not apply to it. However, FDA has evaluatedthe safety of this additive under the general safety clause, consideringall available data and using risk assessment procedures to estimate theupper-bound limit of risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicals, aniline,4-ABP, and quinoline that may be present as impurities in this additive.Based on this evaluation, FDA has concluded that the additive is safe underthe proposed conditions of use.The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (see, e.g., 49FR 13018, 13019; April 2, 1984). The risk evaluation of the carcinogenicimpurities aniline, 4-ABP, and quinoline has two aspects: (1) Assessmentof the worst-case exposure to the impurities from the proposed uses ofthe additive; and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animalbioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.A. AnilineBased on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining styrenated diphenylamine, and on the level of aniline that maybe present in the additive, FDA estimated that the hypothetical worst-caseexposure to aniline from the use of the additive in adhesives and repeateduse rubber articles would not exceed 0.3 picogram per person per day (Ref.3). The agency used data from a carcinogenesis bioassay on aniline conductedfor the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology to estimate the upper-boundlimit of lifetime human risk from exposure to aniline stemming from theproposed use of the additive (Ref. 4). The results of the bioassay on anilinedemonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats under the conditionsof the study, inducing fibrosarcoma, stromal sarcoma, capsular sarcoma,hemangiosarcoma, and osteogenic sarcoma of the spleen.FDA reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity were supported by thisinformation on aniline (Ref. 5). The agency further concluded that an estimateof the upper-bound level of human risk from potential exposure to anilinestemming from the proposed use of the antioxidant could be calculated fromthe bioassay. The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure(linear proportional model) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animalexperiments to the very low doses encountered under the proposed conditionsof use. This procedure is not likely to underestimate the actual risk fromvery low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolationmodels used are designed to estimate the maximum risk consistent with thedata. For this reason, the estimate can be used with confidence to determineto a reasonable certainty whether any harm will result from the proposedconditions and levels of use of the food additive.Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.3 picogram per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to aniline from the use of the styrenated diphenylamineis 3 andmultiply; 10 ^\1\\5\ or 1 in 300 trillion (Ref. 5). Because of thenumerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individualexposure to aniline is expected to be substantially less than the estimateddaily intake. Therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be less.Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harmfrom exposure to aniline that results from the proposed use of the additive.B. 4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP)Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining styrenated diphenylamine, as well as the level of 4-ABP thatmay be present in the additive (Ref. 3), FDA estimated that the hypotheticalworst-case exposure to 4-ABP would not exceed 30 picograms per person perday (Ref. 3). The agency used data in a carcinogenesis bioassay on 4-ABPcontained in a dog study reported by both Block, et al., and Rippe, etal., to estimate the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposureto this chemical stemming from the proposed use of styrenated diphenylamine.The results of the bioassay on 4-ABP demonstrated that this material wascarcinogenic for female beagle dogs under the conditions of the study,inducing papilloma of the bladder (Refs. 7 and 8).FDA reviewed the bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that this information on 4-ABP supported the finding of carcinogenicity.The agency further concluded that an estimate of the upper-bound levelof lifetime human cancer risk from potential exposure to 4-ABP stemmingfrom the proposed use of the antioxidant could be calculated from the bioassay(Ref. 5). Based on a worst-case exposure of 30 picograms per person per day (Ref.3), FDA estimates, using the linear proportional model, that the upper-boundlevel of individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to 4-ABP fromthe use of styrenated diphenylamine is 1.0 x 10^10 or less than 1 in 10billion (Ref. 5). Because of numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate,lifetime-averaged individual exposure to 4-ABP is expected to be substantiallyless than the estimated daily intake, and, therefore, the calculated upper-boundrisk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonablecertainty of no harm from the exposure to 4-ABP that might result fromthe proposed use of the styrenated diphenylamine antioxidant.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Quinoline</ITAG>Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining styrenated diphenylamine, as well as the level of quinolinethat may be present in the additive, FDA estimated that the hypotheticalworst-case exposure to quinoline would not exceed 0.6 picogram per personper day (Ref. 3).The agency used data in a carcinogenesis bioassay on quinoline containedin the reports by Hirao, K., et al., and Shinohara, Y., et al. (Refs. 8and 9), to estimate the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from thischemical stemming from the proposed use of the styrenated diphenylamine.The results of the bioassay on quinoline demonstrated that the materialwas carcinogenic for female rats and mice under the conditions of the study,inducing vascular tumors of the liver.FDA reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity were supported by thisinformation on quinoline. The agency further concluded that an estimateof the upper-bound limit of human risk from potential exposure to quinolinestemming from the proposed use of the antioxidant could be calculated fromthe bioassay (Ref. 10).Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.6 picogram per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper-bound level of individual lifetime risk from potentialexposure to quinoline from the use of the styrenated diphenylamine is</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">6andmultiply;10^\1\\2\ or 1 in 166 billion (Ref. 10). Because of thenumerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individualexposure to quinoline is expected to be substantially less than the estimateddaily intake, and therefore the calculated upper-bound risk would be less.Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harmfrom exposure to quinoline that might result from the proposed use of thisstyrenated diphenylamine antioxidant.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Need for Specifications</ITAG>The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amount of the aniline,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">4-ABP, and quinoline impurities in the styrenated diphenylamine antioxidant.The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which aniline, 4-ABP, and quinolineare present in the additive, the agency would not expect these impuritiesto become components of food at other than extremely small levels; and(2) the upper-bound level of lifetime risk from exposure, even under worst-caseassumptions, is very low, 1 in 300 trillion for aniline, less than 1 in10 billion for 4-ABP, and 1 in 166 billion for quinoline.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion of Safety</ITAG>FDA has evaluated the available toxicity data in the petition and otherrelevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive inadhesives and rubber articles for repeated use is safe, and that andSection;178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above.
