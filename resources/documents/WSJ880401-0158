FINANCIERE DE PARIBAS of France said consolidated net income after payments to minority interests rose 2.7% last year, to 1.73 billion francs ($307.4 million) from 1.68 billion francs in 1986.    The investment-bank holding company said the 1987 figure was in line with its forecasts. Nonetheless, Paribas fell 1.60 francs (28 cents), to 300.10 francs, on Paris's stock exchange yesterday.    Net banking income, which comprises lending, trading and commissions on financial services, rose 6.1%, to 1.15 billion francs from 1.09 billion francs. The improvement was eroded by a 3.5% decline in capital gains on the group's securities portfolio, to 573 million francs from 594 million francs.    Paribas said the gain in banking income reflected profit growth at its main subsidiaries, as well as a decline in financial charges linked to reduced indebtedness. But it said it was hurt by the October stock-market crash and by continued losses at Credit du Nord, one of its commercial-banking units. It didn't provide figures. </TEXT></DOC>
