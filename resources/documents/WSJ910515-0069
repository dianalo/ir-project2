Even if Vice President Dan Quayle is a drag on GOPfortunes, Democrats face daunting obstacles in preparing for1992. &quot;The problem for the Democrats, even more than nothaving a candidate, is not having anything for a candidate tosay at the presidential level,&quot; says Democratic strategistGreg Schneiders.</LP><TEXT>   But Republicans can count postwar disappointments, too.&quot;It's a question of missed opportunities,&quot; says GOPstrategist John Sears. &quot;Republicans really could have donesomething if they'd gone further in the Gulf, removing SaddamHussein from office. To that degree, I think, there's a senseof relief on the Democratic side.&quot;   The confusion that followed the tidy military victory inthe Persian Gulf tempers the &quot;inspiration&quot; the voters felt atthe time of the war, says maverick GOP theoretician KevinPhillips. As a result, says Mr. Phillips, &quot;I think therewon't be much fallout below the presidential level&quot; damagingto Democratic candidates.   Mr. Schneiders isn't taking much comfort from all of this.&quot;The American people,&quot; he says, &quot;may wish that Bush hadfinished the job. But that doesn't mean they're going to turnto somebody who didn't want to start the job.&quot;   Gloom is the prevailing condition plaguing the Democrats.&quot;You just don't find many Democrats who believe that if wecould just elect a Democratic president, we could eliminatepoverty in this country and we could ensure civil libertiesand freedom. You don't have any hope on the part of theDemocrats,&quot; says Democratic strategist Alan Baron.   The Republican panelists are quick to agree. &quot;TheDemocrats are not remotely prepared for the whole equation&quot;of running the country, says Mr. Phillips. &quot;And this becomesa very important operating force for centrist voters in thesense of not giving the Democrats the wherewithal to tilt thecountry when you don't trust where they are yet.&quot;   The Democrats can't even criticize the chaos that hasoverwhelmed the Persian Gulf in the wake of the militaryvictory, says Mr. Sears. &quot;There are many things the Democratscould have criticized President Bush about. But all those whovoted against joining the war cannot raise their voices aboutany of this or they might remind people just how they didvote,&quot; Mr. Sears says. &quot;That leaves Mr. Bush a little immunefrom criticism about whatever perceived mistakes he may havemade in stopping too soon or not having a plan to handle thesituation afterwards.&quot;   The Democrats, the panelists say, compounded theirproblems by criticizing the war for the wrong reasons.Conservative Republicans, says Mr. Phillips, raised questionsabout postwar &quot;entanglements&quot; in the Gulf that seem to be onthe way towards validation. The Democrats, he says, couldhave echoed that theme, arguing against &quot;getting mired downin this part of the world or fighting to keep the emir on hisgolden toilet seat.&quot; But most Democrats didn't: They arguedpurely against the use of force. And that, he says, &quot;simplyreminded people of the chicken-heartedness that they displayperiodically.&quot;   The Democratic position against starting the war doesn'tfundamentally change anything, says Mr. Schneiders; &quot;itreaffirms what people already thought about the DemocraticParty on foreign policy, and that's not good.&quot;   Mr. Baron believes most pundits have overlooked the depthof anti-incumbent voting in congressional elections lastyear. In prior elections, he says, every time the averagevictory margin of one party's incumbents declined, the marginof the other party's incumbents rose. But in 1990, for thefirst time ever, the winning margins of both Democratic andRepublican incumbents declined at the same time, he says.   If this anti-incumbent feeling grows, he argues, Democratsmight suffer serious damage, given the fact there are more ofthem in office than there are Republicans. &quot;Republicans couldmake some significant gains,&quot; he says. But the otherpanelists tend to doubt that. Mr. Phillips says congressionalraces won't be much affected. Mr. Schneiders is inclined toagree, but believes there might be some effect in a handfulof contests, such as the re-election efforts of DemocraticSens. Terry Sanford of North Carolina and Wyche Fowler ofGeorgia.   As for the Democrats mounting a credible run for thepresidency in 1992, Mr. Phillips argues that the key is theeconomy, but &quot;they are doing such a poor job&quot; making theircase that the Republicans don't even need the war issue tomaintain their White House lease. Mr. Schneiders agrees,ruefully. &quot;There are so many other things working against theDemocratic Party at the presidential level in 1992 that I'mnot sure that the Republicans will get around to using thewar,&quot; he says.   What the Democrats need, the panelists agree, is anoutsider who would take on Washington, the Congress and theparty's ubiquitous special-interest groups -- proving, in Mr.Sears's words, &quot;he's not part of this mob.&quot; Gov. Bill Clintonof Arkansas might fit that bill, says Mr. Sears. The troubleis, &quot;as soon as they {outsider candidates} get going decentlywell, they hear from some of these special interests, tellingthem, `We could support you, if . . . .'&quot;   Gov. Clinton just needs a couple of small things, says Mr.Schneiders -- &quot;a domestic program and some answers toquestions about foreign policy.&quot;   All of the panelists are aware of a highly unlikelyscenario that could turn 1992 around -- a Watergate-likescandal connecting President Bush to the delayed release ofthe U.S. hostages in Iran in 1980. &quot;That's the one way theDemocrats could win,&quot; says Mr. Schneiders, &quot;establishingthrough a congressional committee or a special prosecutorwhat George Bush knew and when he knew it about the hostagedeal.&quot;   On the subject of the vice president, the panelists allagree that, barring unforeseen events, Mr. Bush will keep Mr.Quayle in the No. 2 slot -- costing the ticket, in Mr.Phillips's estimates, 1.5 to 2 percentage points in theelection returns.   Mr. Sears notes that both Dwight Eisenhower and RichardNixon &quot;wanted to make a change {in vice presidents} beforethey faced the electorate a second time, and Nixon even had aspecific person in mind. But if Nixon couldn't do it, I don'tsee anybody else doing it.&quot;   Voters' doubts about Mr. Quayle matter, says Mr.Schneiders, &quot;but not enough.&quot; He adds: &quot;People are going tovote for the top of the ticket, and this is just going tomake them a little less comfortable in voting for Bush. Butit won't turn many voters around.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
