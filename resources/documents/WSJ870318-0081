Allegheny announced last week that a unit of First Boston Corp. had arranged a buyout of the consumer and industrial products concern valued at about $500 million, or about $24.60 a share.    In Washington, Gary Lynch, who heads the SEC's enforcement division, declined comment.    The buyout proposal evidently accelerated a yearlong SEC investigation of, among other things, corporate spending at Allegheny. The SEC began an inquiry in February 1986 as Allegheny faced increasing pressure from shareholders, banks and analysts for spending heavily on corporate overhead while posting huge losses. For the year ended Dec. 29, 1985, Allegheny posted a $109.1 million net loss on sales of $2.1 billion.    According to the filing, the SEC was looking at executive compensation and benefits, as well as expenditures relating to certain company-owned real estate, use of corporate aircraft, travel and entertainment. The company also provided information regarding certain acquisitions and divestitures, accounting and other internal control systems.    The SEC inquiry escalated to a formal investigation of possible federal securities-law violations in August 1986. At that time, Business Week magazine and several shareholder suits charged that extravagant spending by former management was seriously undermining the company. Soon after, Robert J. Buckley resigned as chairman and chief executive officer.    Allegheny said the commission continues to take testimony from employees and others, whom the company wouldn't identify.    The tender offer for Allegheny, which began Friday, also prompted opposition from shareholders involved in ongoing lawsuits against Allegheny and its management. A new lawsuit was filed Monday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court here charging that price of the offer isn't fair. First Boston beat out another bidder that wasn't identified during intense negotiations the weekend preceding the buyout announcement.    Richard Greenfield, an attorney representing shareholders in one suit, said he believes the buyout was intended to absolve well-known board members, including former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., of the possible liability and embarrassment from existing suits.    Allegheny board member Richard M. Cyert, president of Carnegie Mellon University, also is a member of the First Boston board. Allegheny said Mr. Cyert took part in board meetings during which the buyout was discussed, but abstained from voting.    Mr. Greenfield said Mr. Cyert's presence on both boards is a &quot;clear conflict of interest.&quot; Mr. Cyert wasn't available for comment.    Allegheny also disclosed in its filing that 1987 operating profit could total $60.7 million. In 1986, Allegheny had a net loss of $164 million, including a $198.1 million loss from continuing operations and earnings of $34.1 million from discontinued operations. Sales were $1.33 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
