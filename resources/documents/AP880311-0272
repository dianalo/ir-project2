The UAW's 140-member national Chrysler bargaining council,representing 71,700 Chrysler workers, voted Thursday to grantChrysler's request for early talks.   ``If I was overly pessimistic, I doubt that we would have calledthe meeting today or taken the action that we did,'' said Bieber,who along with UAW vice president Marc Stepp had urged the councilapprove the request.   No date has been set for the talks aimed at replacing theexisting three-year contract that expires Sept. 14, but they couldbegin as soon as late April. Talks usually begin in midsummer.   There will be no strike deadline, but the two sides will set atarget date for a settlement when they decide a starting date forthe talks.   ``The company is hopeful that a new contract that is equitableto both sides can be reached expeditiously,'' said Chryslerspokesman Lloyd Northard.   Bieber said the union will seek a two-year contract so that in1990, all Big Three automakers' contracts can be negotiatedtogether for the first time since the union reopened its Chryslercontract in 1979 to make concessions needed by the company.   Last fall, the union negotiated a job-protecting industrypattern contract at Ford Motor Co. The contract quickly wasaccepted at GM, leaving only Chrysler workers without itsprotections this year.   The union would not have agreed to early talks if Chrysler hadnot indicated it was willing to accept the pattern as a basis fornegotiations, giving Chrysler workers.   The relationship between the UAW and Chrysler has been badlyinjured in the past few months by Chrysler's abortive attempt tosell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.   To block the plan, which the union said was a threat tocompanywide job security, angry workers prepared for a series ofcrippling plant-by-plant strikes and stopped participating incritical union-manangement programs for improving productivity andquality.   Last week, Chrysler backed down and Stepp moved quickly tosettle a dispute at a key stamping plant in Sterling Heights, wherethe first strike was to occur. Weekend talks brought a settlementearly Monday morning.   But Stepp didn't tell workers to renew participation the jointprograms until the Thursday meeting, after he received a writtenpromise that top Chrysler executives will resume monthly meetingswith top union officials.   In the past two years the Chrysler-UAW ``round table,'' whereunion and company officials had consulted on major decisions sinceits creation in 1979, met only once, Stepp said.   Stepp said the lack of round table meetings indicated Chryslerhad changed its attitude toward its workers for the worse.   With the agreement of Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony St. Johnto resume the meetings, Stepp said he believes workers' anger willease.   The two sides still must work out an Acustar-related sore point.Chrysler said it will close four Acustar plants if it can't sellthem within 18 months. The UAW wants to protect the plants' 2,000workers.   During the week of March 20, national union officials and theelected 10-member rank-and-file Chrysler negotiating team will drawup their demands and strategies for fitting established autoindustry contracts to Chrysler.   The GM and Ford contracts prohibit plant closings unlessproduction is cut because of slow sales, make the transfer of workto outside suppliers more difficult and slow the rate of attrition.   They also contain a profit-sharing formula based on thecompanies' U.S. performance. At Ford, workers reaped averageprofit-sharing checks of more than $3,700 apiece from Ford's record$4.6 billion profit.   Chrysler workers have no profit-sharing formula and insteadreceive a $500 bonus annually regardless of their company'sperformance.</TEXT></DOC>
