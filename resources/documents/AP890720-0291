Levine, the admitted inside traderwhose confessions spawned Wall Street's scandals, told a group ofbusiness students Thursday he has started a financial consultingpractice in mergers and acquisitions.   On other matters, Levine praised the performance of governmentinvestigators as ``phenomenal,'' said the criminal justice systemtreated him fairly, criticized the media's portrayal of him asgreedy, and expressed remorse for breaking the law.   ``In my case, the combination of inexperience, unbridledambition, impatience and gross errors of judgment led me to breakthe law,'' Levine told about 100 students and faculty at New YorkUniversity's business school.   ``I blame myself and make no excuses and take fullresponsibility for my actions,'' he said.   Levine, 36, who was not paid to speak at NYU, traced hisinvolvement in a network of securities trading that used illegallyobtained information about pending corporate takeovers to net $11.6million in illicit profits.   Levine, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. whenhe was charged in May 1986, said his illicit activities included anetwork of code names, foreign corporations and overseas bankaccounts.   ``In a vastly different environment, when I made the decision tocross the line I didn't think about getting caught,'' he said. ``Iwas a wet-behind-the-ears naive rookie who should have known betterbut didn't.''   Answering a student's question, Levine said that since hisparole he has started a financial consulting practice and foughtcivil lawsuits he said have sought $1 billion in claims.   ``I believe as a result of my prosecution and others the insidertrading has declined,'' he said, adding that people who try thatkind of activity today ``are playing Russian roulette.''   In a plea bargain with prosecutors, Levine pleaded guilty tofour felonies, was fined $362,000 and returned $11.6 million inillegal profits. He also told the government about Ivan F. Boesky,the now-imprisoned insider trader who himself made millions ofdollars using information supplied by Levine.   Levine was paroled last September from a two-year prison termfor securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.</TEXT></DOC>
