These big companies, which have long managed billions of dollars of investments for their own pension funds, have branched into the business of managing money for outsiders, primarily other corporations.    Wang Labs has set up a $50 million venture-capital fund with money coming mainly from investors in Taiwan, where the computer company and its founder, An Wang, have longstanding ties.    GE is offering to help companies invest in real estate, foreign stocks and leveraged buy-outs. Since AMR's investment unit began handling money for others in mid-1987, it has received $550 million in outside assets, and the parent of American Airlines predicts that amount will double within two years.    Why are companies best known for making computers or flying to Chicago getting into the already overcrowded money-management business? One reason is to cut the costs of handling their own investments while potentially turning those operations into profit centers.    &quot;You have about the same overhead to manage $1 billion as $100 million,&quot; says William M. Valiant, vice president and treasurer of Borg-Warner Corp., which has looked at managing outside money.    &quot;This is very low risk for us because we're not adding any significant staff or resources to do it,&quot; says Dale E. Frey, chairman of the General Electric Investment Corp. unit of GE, which has long had big financial operations but only this year entered the outside money-management business. &quot;It doesn't require us to do much different than what we're doing today.&quot;    Management fees charged outside clients do more than offer corporations the possiblity of making a profit on their investment operations. The fees also help companies with a longstanding dilemma -- how to keep their investment experts from jumping to better-paying jobs as independent money managers.    &quot;You can't pay money-management people the way you pay people who make containers,&quot; says Ronald C. Boller, director of benefit finance for container-maker Owens-Illinois. Most corporations can't hope to match salaries of money-management firms, where a successful portfolio manager can earn anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million or more.    But having outside clients helps narrow the salary gap. &quot;You get so tired of these people in New York and Chicago making $1 million a year for doing the same things you do,&quot; Mr. Boller says of big-city money managers.    Big companies all say they bring something special to money management. GE's Mr. Frey says he thinks the last thing the world needs is another money manager promising clients to match the performance of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. But investing in real estate, international stocks and privately placed securities -- including taking equity stakes in leveraged buy-outs -- are another matter.    Expertise in these fields is harder to come by, requiring most companies to seek outside consultants. GE already has experts in these fields to handle its own huge $30 billion investment operation for its corporate, pension and employee-savings funds.    Mr. Frey says GE has lined up some clients since it quietly launched its money-management services with the formation of General Electric Investment's GE Investment Management Inc. unit earlier this year, but he won't elaborate. He says the plunge in U.S. stock prices &quot;made pension funds think about the merits of diversification&quot; into areas such as those GE is offering its services.    GE Investment says it believes potential clients are most likely to come from its fellow large pension funds, and doesn't want to beat the bushes for clients. &quot;It's not our intent to build up a massive national marketing organization,&quot; Mr. Frey said.    Unlike a GE, which handles almost all its investments internally, Owens-Illinois farms out about 90% of its $2.5 billion in funds to outside investment managers. For the remainder, however, the Toledo, Ohio, concern came up with strategies for picking growth stocks that it decided might interest other investors.    The result: It organized a growth-stock mutual fund in 1986 through a wholly owned Owens-Illinois investment unit, Harbor Capital Investors Inc. Finding that many clients were looking for more diversification, Harbor Capital followed with five more funds, ranging from international stocks to a conservative money-market fund.    So far, the outside money hasn't flooded in; Owens-Illinois and affiliates still account for 95% of the mutual funds' total assets of $267 million. But Mr. Boller, who is chairman of Harbor Capital, says the operation is already &quot;paying its way,&quot; and Harbor has just begun canvassing what it considers its biggest potential market -- small pension plans and endowments with assets of under $50 million.    Similarly, AMR Investment Services Inc.'s profit in the money-management business has been modest -- under $1 million -- and it has recently hired two marketing people to drum up business. &quot;It's a hard sell,&quot; concedes William F. Quinn, president of the AMR Corp. unit.    Much of the future growth in AMR's $550 million in outside assets is expected to be in its &quot;American Advantage&quot; mutual funds. In these funds, AMR doesn't actually pick investment, but acts as a &quot;manager of managers,&quot; divvying up money among its stable of outside money managers that also handle the bulk of AMR's pension investments. In addition, AMR sponsors a money-market fund for outsiders, which it manages itself.    Mr. Quinn says AMR's approach offers clients diversity at lower cost, especially for small and mid-size pension funds that couldn't hire numerous outside money managers anyway. In addition, while many regions of the U.S. are knee deep in blue-chip money managers, AMR's Dallas base may give it an advantage. &quot;We're someone unique in our part of the country,&quot; says Mr. Quinn.    Wang Labs says it's using its business experience in Asia in offering its venture capital fund, 90% of which is being financed by government and private investors from Taiwan. The company also is offering to finance the leasing of non-Wang equipment for the first time. &quot;The strength we're leveraging off of is the company's global-financial experience,&quot; said Martin Goldman, president of Wang Development andamp; Investment Corp.    In other areas, the company has hired a marketing executive to look for money-management clients in the U.S. Last summer, Wang announced it would set up Bermuda-based stock, bond and money-market mutual funds for foreign investors, although the company currently says it is going slow on those, wanting to concentrate on the other new financial services first.    &quot;This is the world's most competitive business,&quot; Mr. Goldman said of the money-management field. &quot;Unless you have a strategy, it can be a very dangerous business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
