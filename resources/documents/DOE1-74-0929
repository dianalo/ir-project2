However, the once-vigorous and growingUS nuclear power industry has lost much of its vitality. Energy needs,environmental concerns, and continued reliance on electricity stronglyindicate that nuclear plants should provide an increasing part of ourenergy supply. Failure to deal positively with the growing energy problemsincluding stagnation of the nuclear power industry threatens the futureeconomic well-being of the United States.
