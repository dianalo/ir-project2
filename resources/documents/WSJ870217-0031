But Reliance, a financial holding company controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg, placed its nominee on the Spectra-Physics board, expanding it to nine members. The new director is Robert T. Bruce, 51 years old, president and chief executive officer of Quadrex Corp., a Campbell, Calif., provider of energy, decontamination and recycling services.    Reliance owns 16% of Quadrex common and 13% of Spectra-Physics common. In January, as previously reported, Reliance said it would seek a more active role in Spectra-Physics' operations, including possible control. Spectra-Physics makes lasers and laser-related products.    Herbert M. Dwight Jr., chairman of Spectra-Physics, said, &quot;We are pleased that we have resolved some of our differences with Reliance by agreeing to Reliance's request that Mr. Bruce be elected to our board.&quot;    For its first quarter ended Dec. 31, Spectra-Physics earned $146,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $48.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
