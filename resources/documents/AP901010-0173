Itstables were set with fish forks and fish spoons. Waiters woredesigner uniforms. And ties and jackets were required of thecustomers.   A dinner for two cost $165.   Today there is no caviar and the fish forks are stored away.Waiters wear their own slacks and shirts. There are more tables,pushed closer together.   The price for two is about $100 - a hefty sum for most people,but a dramatic cut for the Upper East Side restaurant.   ``I felt we were in a vastly changing world and that I needed tokeep up,'' says Len Allison, chef-owner of Huberts.   This is the year of rude awakenings for restaurant owners in NewYork City. The economic downturn - triggered by the stock marketcrash in 1987 - has hit them hard, especially proprietors ofsecond-tier luxury establishments.   At credit-card restaurants, sales were down 15 percent to 20percent in June, compared to the same month last year, whilenationally they dropped between 12 percent and 14 percent, saysrestaurant consultant Michael Whiteman.   A Gallup poll for the National Restaurant Association inWashington, D.C., showed 22 percent of adults ate lunch out on anygiven day in July, compared with 30 percent in June. The polls wereof 1,000 people and had a margin of error of 3.5 points. Expensiverestaurants are hardest hit.   ``People will trade down for lunch,'' said George Rice, aspokesman for Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends, which tracksrestaurant industry data. ``It's Chez Paul's to Bennigan's andBennigan's to Denny's and then Denny's to McDonald's. That's beengoing on for a few years and it will accelerate.''   Restaurant owners from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit andBoston say they, too, are adjusting to a newly cost-consciousdining public. But their outlook is brighter than that of their NewYork City counterparts.   ``I think we are going through the same thing. But it's harderin New York,'' said Jasper White, chef-owner of Jasper's, anupscale restaurant in an old molasses warehouse in Boston.   New York City is bigger, it is tied more closely to the fortunesof the financial community, and it has more restaurants competingfor survival, he said. Moreover, the dining public has more torevolt against in the Big Apple since restaurant prices are by farthe highest in the country.   The average price of dinner for one in New York City - threecourses, one drink and tip in the 20 most popular restaurantsaccording the popular Zagat survey of eateries - is $61. In LosAngeles, the city with the second most expensive meal prices, theaverage is $43.   ``I think the restaurants that were popular in the '80s had ashiny armor,'' says Adam Tihany, co-owner of Remi, a new andpopular trattoria in midtown Manhattan, where dinner costs about$35 a person.   The places that are successful in the 1990s, he says, will berun by people who truly care and ``turn out a product that ...gives you value for what you are spending.''   Indeed, mid-priced bistros where the atmosphere is casual andthe food is simple are thriving in New York City, says Tim Zagat,publisher of the surveys.   ``People want to eat well because they are used to that but theydon't want to spend as much time or as much money as they usedto,'' says Jimmy Schmidt, chef-owner of the Rattlesnake Club inDetroit.   His successful restaurant on the Detroit River featuresmidwestern cooking in a light, airy environment filled withcontemporary art. About 80 percent of the main courses are pricedunder $20.   Picey restaurants that do not have four-star reputations forfood and service are revamping their menus and decor to appeal tothe spontaneous, cost-conscious diner.   The glitterati used to pack Melrose, a basement restaurant inNew York's Greenwich Village where they could dine on smallportions of California food served on big white plates for $55 aperson. But when the trend setters moved on, Melrose emptied.   Owner Lee Friedman realized neighborhood people ``weren't goingto come in for three slices of rare-charred tuna for $25.''   Earlier this year, he renamed Melrose the Barrow Street Bistro,cut prices about 40 percent, toned down the austere decor andchanged the menu to include heartier bistro cooking. Business haspicked up and more than half of Friedman's customers are from theneighborhood.   In Boston, Jasper's was hit hard by the stock market crash.Overnight it lost many of its expense account clients.   ``We reacted immediately,'' says White, the chef-owner. The menuwas expanded to include lower-priced items like fish cakes and potroasts. And the waiters donned white aprons instead of tuxedos. Theaverage dinner price for one person dropped from $70 to $55.   Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef, says she expects to seefewer luxury restaurants in the coming years but not fewer peopleeating out.   ``It's not, `Uh, oh! We're in a recession. Let's start cookinglittle chicken things at home,''' says the owner of Square One,where dinner averages $35 a person and the atmosphere is warm andfriendly.   ``People are working just as hard, twice as hard as ever before.The last thing we need after work is to go to the supermarket andcook.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weds AMs, Oct. 10</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
