It is known that the elevated temperatures generated may havea detrimental effect on final strengths and that if the difference intemperature between the centre and the surroundings exceeds 20-25{sup0}C, cracking may occur. In order to study these effects, a calorimetriccontrolled apparatus has been designed that is able to simulate the temperaturerise profile occurring within any size of concrete pour. The apparatusis also used to control a curing bath thus enabling the compressive strengthof match cured concrete to be determined. Results have been obtainedfor both temperature rise and strength growth at the centre of simulated0.8., 1.5 and 3 m deep pours, using plain Portland and Portland PFa cementconcrete. These show that in the larger sized pours the strength of concretefrom a Portland PFA cement blend grows, after 2-3 days, at a greaterrate than that of pure Portland cement, while giving lower temperaturerises, other results are given.</TEXT></DOC>
