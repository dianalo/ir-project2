The proposed site isnot the Interim site which has been used historically, but an alternativesite in the vicinity of the Interim site. The Interim site was not proposedfor designation because of its location within popular commercial and sportfishing areas. The alternative site proposed for designation was determinedto be the most environmentally preferable location. The proposed site designationis until midnight December 31, 1991, and is subject to a seasonal restrictionand continuing monitoring to ensure that unacceptable adverse environmentalimpacts do not occur.

Background </ITAG>Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Actof 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401 <T3>et seq.</T3> (``The Act''), gives the Administrator of EPA the authorityto designate sites where ocean dumping may be permitted. On October 1,1986 the Administrator delegated the authority to designate dredged materialand woodburning sites to the Regional Administrator of the region in whichthe site is located. This site designation action is being proposed pursuantto that authority. The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR chapter I, subchapter H andSection;228.4)state that ocean dumping sites will be designated by publication in part228. This site designation is being published as proposed rulemaking inaccordance with section 228 of the Ocean Dumping Regulations, which permitsthe designation of ocean disposal sites. Interested persons may participatein this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments by November2, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. EIS Development </ITAG>Section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.,</T3> (``NEPA'') requires that Federal agencies prepare anenvironmental impact statement (EIS) on proposals for major Federal actionssignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The objectof NEPA is to build into the agency decision-making process careful considerationof all environmental aspects of proposed actions. While NEPA does not applyto EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed to prepareEISs in connection with ocean dumping site designations such as this. EPA has prepared a draft EIS entitled Draft Environmental Impact Statementfor the Designation of an Ocean Woodburning Site for the New York Bight.The notice of availability of this draft EIS for public review and commentis being published concurrently in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The public comment period on this draft EISis the same as for this proposed rule. Anyone desiring a copy of the draftEIS may obtain one from the addresses given above. The action discussed in the draft EIS is the designation of an ocean sitefor woodburning at-sea. The purpose of the designation is to provide anenvironmentally acceptable location for ocean burning of wood. Appropriatenessof ocean disposal is determined on a case-by-case basis as part of theprocess of issuing permits for ocean disposal. New information concerning practicable land-based alternatives has becomeavailable since the printing of the draft EIS. Therefore, although thedraft EIS suggested a 5 year site designation, the period of designationis being limited to midnight December 31, 1991 under this proposed rule.In order to ensure that the December 31, 1991 expiration date is attaineda phase out schedule would be added to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers(COE) permit which will require them to develop and to implement land basedalternatives and gradually reduce the volume of material burned at-seauntil all the wooden material is disposed of via land-based alternativesby December 31, 1991. Any other potential permittees will be subject tothe same requirements.The EIS discusses the need for the action and examines ocean disposal sitesand alternatives to the proposed action. Land-based disposal alternativesincluding land-based incineration; reuse/recycling alternatives such ashorticultural mulch, lumber, and mass incineration with heat recovery oruse as fuel; landfilling via burial along shorelines or via disposal atexisting landfills; and use as fuel for gasification facilities are alsoexamined. Generally, all of these land-based disposal methods presentedvarious technical, economic and institutional constraints, and are notcurrently viable disposal alternatives for the large scale disposal ofwooden debris from New York Harbor. Implementable disposal alternativesto burning at-sea are currently not available. However, in light of recentadvances, particularly woodchipping and gasification facilities, EPA believesthat implementable disposal alternatives can be available by December 31,1991. For this reason, while the need for a woodburning site currentlyexists, land-based alternatives can be implemented that obviate the needfor a permanent site designation beyond December 31, 1991. Certain land-baseddisposal methods may also be both technically and economically feasiblefor current projects, therefore EPA will determine the need for ocean burningon a permit-by-permit and case-by-case basis. In an effort to ensure theadequate investigation of land-based alternatives, EPA will include specificconditions in any future permits requiring the permittee to pilot woodchippingoperations and associated land-based disposal. Designation of an oceanwoodburning site does not imply that the site will be available for allpermit applicants. Conversely, each permit applicant must demonstrate aneed in order for the permit to be issued; and each project encompassedby the permit will be assessed individually before being allowed to usethe site. Ocean woodburning site options evaluated included the continueduse of the Interim woodburning site, the evaluation of alternative siteslocated within the New York Bight, and the consideration of an off-continentalshelf site. An alternative woodburning site within the New York Bight wasdetermined to be the most environmentally acceptable site.The EIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability ofocean woodburning areas for final designation and is based upon a siteenvironmental study. The study and final designation process are beingconducted in accordance with the Act, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, andother applicable Federal environmental legislation.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Proposed Site Designation</ITAG>The proposed site is a rectangle approximately 2.5 by 5.0 nautical mileslocated approximately 21 nautical miles off the coast of Seaside Park,New Jersey. The site occupies an area of approximately 12.5 square nauticalmiles, and water depths average 30 meters. The coordinates of the siteare as follows:<ITAG tagnum="25">Latitude: 39anddegrees; 52andmin16; 40andmin16;andmin16; to 39anddegrees; 57andmin16;00andmin16;andmin16; N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Longitude: 73anddegrees; 35andmin16; 20andmin16;andmin16; to 73anddegrees; 38andmin16;10andmin16;andmin16; W</ITAG>All of the wooden debris burned at the designated site will be from NewYork Harbor and its environs. No woodburning activities may occur frommidnight May 26 to midnight September 7 each year, the peak periods ofrecreational activity. The total amount of wooden debris burned at theInterim site between 1973 and 1988 has been approximately 405,345 tons.If at any time woodburning operations at the site cause significant adverseimpacts, further use of the site will be restricted or terminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposalsites for continuing use. (1) Sites are selected so as to minimize interferencewith other marine activities, (2) to keep any temporary perturbations fromthe woodburning from causing impacts outside the site, and (3) to permiteffective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. (4)Where feasible, locations off the Continental Shelf are chosen. (5) Ifat anytime woodburning at an Interim site causes significant adverse impacts,the use of that site will be terminated as soon as suitable alternate woodburningsites can be designated. The general criteria are given in andSection; 228.5of the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations, and andSection; 228.6 lists elevenspecific factors used in evaluating a proposed woodburning site to assurethat the general criteria are met.The proposed site, as discussed below under the eleven specific factors,is acceptable under the five general criteria except for the preferenceof sites located off the Continental Shelf. EPA has determined, based uponthe information presented in the draft EIS, that a site off the ContinentalShelf is not feasible and that no environmental benefit would be obtainedby selecting such a site instead of the site proposed in this action. Technicalconstraints associated with the selection of a site off the ContinentalShelf include a structural and stability review of each vessel by the CoastGuard and the potential structural retrofitting, and weather constraintson the time required to complete a round trip. From a safety standpoint,the selection of a site off the Continental Shelf would increase the transittime to the woodburning site from approximately 8-12 hours to about threedays. Because weather conditions often fluctuate quite rapidly, EPA believesthat the safety of the workers could be jeopardized if they were off theContinental Shelf and a storm arose. Danger is most inherent during a severestorm which may force the tug operator to release the barge, resultingin its uncontrolled passage which may endanger other vessels through itspresence and/or the release of wood debris. The environmental benefitsassociated with relocating the burn site to a site off the ContinentalSite would not sufficiently outweigh the safety problems that would resultfrom increasing the distance of the woodburning site from New York Harbor.The location of the woodburning site has been chosen to minimize the interferenceof woodburning activities with other activities in the marine environment.The site is not located in major shipping lanes. Temporary impacts on waterquality from burning at-sea can be expected to return to ambient levelsbefore reaching any beach, shoreline, or known geographical limit of afishery or shellfishery. Based upon woodburning site evaluation studiespresented in the EIS, the site proposed for designation satisfies the criteriafor site selection. The woodburning site has been limited in size in orderto localize, for identification and control, any immediate adverse impactsand to facilitate the implementation of an effective monitoring and surveillanceprogram to prevent adverse long range impacts.EPA established the eleven specific factors (andSection; 228.6) to constitutean environmental assessment of the impact of woodburning at the site. Thecriteria are used to make comparisons between the alternative sites andare the basis for final site selection. The characteristics of the proposedsite are reviewed below in terms of these eleven factors. 1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography, and DistanceFrom Coast (40 CFR 228.6(a)(1))The rectangular site is approximately 12.5 square nautical miles in sizeand is located approximately twenty one nautical miles off the coast ofSeaside Park, New Jersey. The coordinates of the site are given above inSection C of this proposed rule. Water depths average 30 meters at thesite. The bottom topography of the proposed site would not be altered bythe woodburning activities as neither the wooden debris nor residual ashesare dumped into the water, hence, the impact on bottom topography willbe virtually none. 2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery Feeding, or PassageAreas of Living Resources in Adult or Juvenile Phases (40 CFR 228.6(a)(2))The proposed site does not encompass any known unique breeding, spawning,nursery, or passage area for nekton, finfish, shellfish, marine mammals,or birds. Marine mammals including whales, dolphins, and sea turtles frequentthe New York Bight on a seasonal basis, and shellfish grounds includingclams, quahogs, sea scallops, and lobsters can be found throughout theBight. The Bight also supports a large commercial and recreational fisheriesof species including fluke, Atlantic mackerel, scup, whiting, red hake,black sea bass, Atlantic bonito, bluefin tuna, tautog, and bluefish. Theproposed woodburning site was selected because of its location outsideof predominant commercial and recreational fishing areas, and does notconstitute a unique site within the Bight for any of these species. 3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas. (40 CFR 228.6(a)(3))For shoreline areas in both New York and New Jersey, recreation and tourismrepresent a major component of the economy. The recreationally developedland along these shoreline areas is a mixture of Federal and State parksand beaches operated by local communities. Recreational facilities underFederal jurisdiction include the Gateway National Recreational Area, JamaicaBay National Seashore, and Fire Island National Seashore. Barnegat LighthouseState Park and Island Beach State Park are operated by the New Jersey StateDivision of Parks and Forestry. Beaches under local jurisdiction includePoint Lookout, Lido Beach Atlantic Beach, Nassau Beach Park, and Long Beachin New York and seventy miles of beaches in New Jersey. As neither woodendebris nor ashes are discharged into the water during a woodburning operation,site designation will not impact the use of these beaches. 4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed to be Disposed of, and ProposedMethods of Release, Including Methods of Packing the Waste, If Any (40CFR 228.6(a)(4))Only wooden debris generated within New York Harbor and its environs maybe burned at the currently used Interim site, as well as at the proposedsite. Between 1973 and 1988, the volume of wooden debris burned at theInterim site has totaled 405,345 tons and has consisted primarily of pilings,timbers, driftwood, wooden hulls, and similar wooden materials. The annualtonnage burned varies significantly from year to year, and in 1988 a totalof 32,167 tons was burned at the Interim site. A waste characterization must be performed prior to burning in order toascertain that the material is suitable for burning at-sea. Data on thechemical characteristics of the wood will be reviewed by EPA prior to allowingany wood to be burned. 5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring (40 CFR 228.6(a)(5))Surveillance of woodburning operations at the proposed site could be achievedby helicopter, a shiprider aboard the tugboat transporting the burn barge,or an independent vessel. Periodic monitoring and surveillance by EPA,the Coast Guard, and the permittees will continue for as long as the siteis used. Additional monitoring will be required if the volume or characteristicsof the material to be burned changes significantly in order to ensure thatadverse impacts do not develop. If evidence of significant adverse environmentaleffects is found, EPA will take the appropriate steps to limit or terminateburning at the site. Periodic reports of the monitoring operations willbe made available to interested persons upon request. 6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport, and Vertical Mixing Characteristicsof the Area, Including Prevailing Current Direction and Velocity, If Any(40 CFR 228.6(a)(6))Because neither the wooden debris nor the resultant ashes are disposedoverboard, the quantity of dissolved or particulate matter entering thewater column as a result of the burning operations will be minimal. Theonly particulate matter which may enter the water column are ashes whichare blown off the burn barge, and material which may wash into the watercolumn when the barge is wetdown. Debris from these sources will not resultin a significant increase in the level of suspended solids or turbidity.A permit condition will mandate that all permittees completely wetdownat the burnsite until there is no longer any steam emanating from the burnbarge. A separate wetdown site will not be designated, and no barge mayleave the burnsite until a wetdown has been performed. Hydrographic conditions and related vertical mixing characteristics varygreatly from season to season in the New York Bight. The amount of verticalmixing will determine the degree to which materials released into the surfacewaters will remain at high concentrations or be dispersed. During the summermonths, the high degree of stratification created by the strong temperaturegradient and relatively moderate winds will result in a greater tendencyfor the dissolved and particulate materials to remain at shallow depthsand be mixed horizontally by the surface currents. Dissolved and particulatematerials added to the surface waters during the fall, winter, and springwould be more likely to disperse throughout the water column. Surface currentsgenerally flow southward.7. <T3>Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction,Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture, Areas of Special Scientific Importance,and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean</T3> (40 CFR 228.6(a)(8))The woodburning site is located near the navigation lanes serving the portsof New York and New Jersey, but woodburning activities should not interferewith shipping activities. Smoke resulting from woodburning activities couldreduce visibility. However, any such problems would be restricted to theimmediate area of the woodburning site since the burn barges are confinedto that specific area. The woodburning site is clearly marked on NationalOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration navigational maps, and theneed for caution in this area is indicated.Floating or partially submerged waste wood from the burn barge could becomea navigational hazard or damage fishing nets and other gear. Specific proceduresfor barge loading and retrieving wood that might fall overboard are includedin the permit conditions for use at the site to minimize the potentialfor wood wastes being dislodged during transport.The smoke plume from the woodburning operation will not affect air trafficin the area. Although there is a great deal of air traffic in the New YorkHarbor area, this traffic is generally at altitudes above the height ofthe smoke plume. There is a possibility that a low-flying aircraft maypass through a smoke plume, but the passage would be so momentary thatit would be extremely unlikely to affect aircraft. Previous monitoringreports have indicated that woodburning at-sea would have no significantenvironmental effect on either commercial or recreational fisheries inthe New York Bight. The woodburning site does not infringe upon eithercommercial or sport fishing locations, and the closest sport fishing takesplace approximately one nautical mile east of the site. Wind dispersionof the particulates followed by rapid dilution via diffusion in the watercolumn prevents any significant increase in pollution loads above ambientsea water concentrations.No significant physical or aesthetic impacts on beaches or other type ofrecreational resources would result from the woodburning operations. Thereare no known economically recoverable mineral resources on the sea floorbelow the woodburning site. Therefore, mineral extraction is not a concern.Similarly, fish and shellfish are not cultured in the vicinity of the woodburningsite, and the water is not used for desalination. The woodburning siteis not an area of special scientific importance.A special permit condition prohibits woodburning activities from midnightMay 26 to midnight September 7, during periods of peak recreational activity.This moratorium adds further protection against any adverse physical oraesthetic impacts on recreational resources from woodburning operations.8. <T3>The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined byAvailable Data or by Trend Assessment or Baseline Surveys</T3> (40 CFR228.6(a)(9))Water column species known to frequent the New York Bight include variousfinfish, shellfish, and marine mammals. Commercially and recreationallyimportant species of finfish include fluke, flounder, Atlantic bonito,bluefin tuna, bluefish, and tautog. Shellfish resources within the Bightinclude surf clams, quahogs, sea scallops, and lobsters. Marine mammalssuch as whales, dolphins, and sea turtles frequent the Bight on a seasonalbasis or during migration. The woodburning site is not a critical environmentfor any of these species.Water quality characteristics at the site including temperature, salinity,density, and organic and inorganic loading rates are typical of the generalBight environment. The Bight Apex is a heavily used and environmentallystressed coastal area. Municipal and industrial wastewater effluents, alongwith runoff, atmospheric fallout, and the metals disposed of at the differentdump sites, contribute large quantities of heavy metals, nutrients, organicmatter, and chlorinated hydrocarbons to the waters there. The distributionof these materials is generally a function of the distance from the sourceand composition of the solids that are either suspended in the water columnor accumulated on the bottom. Toward the outer edges and outside of theApex, nutrient and dissolved oxygen levels are quite predictable and area function of the water's temperature-salinity structure and the degreeof weather-induced mixing. Woodburning activities will not adversely impactthe water quality of the Bight.9. <T3>Existence At or In Close Proximity to the Site of Any Significant orCultural Features of Historical Importance</T3> (40 CFR 228.6(a)(11))Cultural or historical activities at or near the woodburning site are notknown to exist. There are no known shipwrecks of historical significancein the vicinity of the woodburning site. Certain historical re-enactmentssuch as the parade of tall ships and similar regattas may occur in thevicinity of the woodburning site, but the impact of the disposal operationon such events would occur primarily during the summer months when thereis a woodburning moratorium.10. <T3>Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumpingin the Area (Including Cumulative Effects)</T3> (40 CFR 228.6(a)(7))A variety of disposal activities are currently practiced in the New YorkBight. Sewage sludge, dredged material, cellar dirt, and acid wastes haveall been discharged into the New York Bight. Several environmental impactstatements have been prepared by EPA to address ocean waste disposal inthe New York Bight.Data suggest that previous dumping has created only minor modificationsat the sight. Available information indicates that no significant increaseof oil, grease, petroleum hydrocarbons, or trace metals will occur in theseawater concentrations as a result of fallout from the woodburning operations.Woodburning activities will not impact marine mammals other than to causethem to avoid the burn barge when in operation.11. <T3>Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Speciesin the Disposal Site </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(10))Prior to burning, the wooden debris may contain undesirable organisms ornuisance species such as rodents; however, the burning process would exterminatethem. There are no components in the wooden debris that would attract orrecruit nuisance species at the disposal site. Therefore, the use of anocean woodburning site is unlikely to result in the development or recruitmentof nuisance species.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Proposed Action</ITAG>The draft EIS recommends that the proposed site be designated for fiveyears. However, because new information concerning practicable land-basedalternatives has become available since the printing of the draft EIS,EPA is proposing that the period of designation of a woodburning at-seasite be limited until midnight December 31, 1991. The proposed site iscompatible with the general criteria and specific factors used for siteevaluation.The designation of the woodburning site as an EPA approved ocean burningsite is being published as proposed rulemaking. Management of this sitehas been delegated to the Regional Administrator of Region II.It should be emphasized that designation of an ocean woodburning site doesnot constitute or imply EPA's approval of the actual burning of materialsat-sea. Before burning any material at the site may commence, EPA mustevaluate a permit application according to EPA's ocean dumping criteria.EPA has the right to disapprove the actual burning if it determines thatenvironmental concerns under the Act have not been satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Regulatory Assessments</ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is requested to perform a regulatoryflexibility analysis for all rules which may have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that thisaction will not have a significant impact on small entities since the sitedesignation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option forwooden debris. Consequently, this rule does not necessitate preparationof a regulatory flexibility analysis.Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a regulatory flexibility analysis.This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more or cause any other effects which would result in its beingclassified by the executive order as a ``major'' rule. Consequently, thisrule does not necessitate preparation of a regulatory impact analysis.This proposed rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to the Office of Management and Budget review under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 228</ITAG>Water pollution control.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
