The most recent U.S. intelligence estimates show that Iranreceived up to 65 percent of its armaments from China last year,said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.   American experts were quoted four months ago as saying Chinesearms to Iran were flowing at a rate of $1 billion a year, and theofficials said that figure appears to have held up through the endof 1987.   China also has sold huge amounts of weapons to Iraq since thebeginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, but those sales slacked offlast year, the officials said.   There is still some question whether China is continuing to shipSilkworm missiles to Iran, according to the officials. Theseanti-ship missiles are the most notorious weapons in the Iranianarsenal because they have been fired from shoreline batteriesagainst international shipping in the Persian Gulf.   The United States _ notably during a face-to-face confrontationby Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Beijing last spring _pleaded with China to stop the Silkworm sales. For months, Chinadenied the sales were taking place. Then it acknowledged that Iranmay have been getting them indirectly through other countries andsaid it would try to stop that flow.   ``This was construed as a face-saving way for China to say twothings at the same time: they weren't selling Silkworms to Iran andthat they were stopping them,'' an official said.   Also in Iran's arsenal of Chinese weapons are small arms,ammunition, machine guns and artillery, the officials said.   The United States has protested the sales by ending adecade-long process of easing restrictions on the type of high-techU.S. equipment China can buy. The decision will make it harder forChina to buy computers and advanced electronics now reaching themarket.   According to one official, China has sold $7 billion in arms toIran and Iraq since 1979, but Congressional Research Serviceestimates indicate this figure might be inflated.   In a report to Congress last May, the service estimated thatChina's total arms sales to all Third World countries totalednearly $7.3 billion between 1979 and 1986. In the last four yearsof that period, China ranked fourth, behind the Soviet Union, theUnited States and France, in that order, in sales to Third Worldcountries.   Even with the discrepancy, ``there's no doubt that Chinese salesto Iran are very large,'' a congressional expert said.   Last July 20, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolutioncalling upon Iran and Iraq to end the war and said it would followwith a second resolution imposing an arms embargo on whichevercountry failed to heed the truce call.   Iraq has agreed to a cease-fire, but Iran has not, so the UnitedStates and its allies on the U.N. body are now pressing for thearms embargo against Tehran.   Shultz is expected to press the Soviets, during talks in Moscowthis week, to agree to the second resolution.   China, a permanent member of the Security Council, theoreticallycould veto an arms embargo resolution.   An official specializing in Chinese affairs said, however, theChinese are unlikely to exercise that right.   ``China has always taken a passive role at the United Nations,''the official said. `` Being influential at the U.N. goes againstthe Chinese view that it should not seek to hegemony in worldaffairs, as it charges the United States and the Soviet Unionalways does.''   ``They are not going to favor the resolution _ it will hurt themtoo much financially _ but they probably won't block it,'' theofficial said.</TEXT></DOC>
