The rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors,'' havefought government forces to a stalemate at Jalalabad, in easternAfghanistan, since Soviet troops ended more than nine years ofinvolvement in the country Feb. 15.   Casualties are estimated in the thousands, making it one of thebloodiest battles of the war.   The most extreme of the Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla leaders,however, want no part of a peace agreement that does not give powerto their self-proclaimed ``interim'' Afghan government, acabinet-in-exile composed of a seven-party mujahedeen alliance withheadquarters in this Pakistani frontier city.   Pakistan backs the rebels with help from the United States andshelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees.   Critics of the guerrilla regime, formed in February, charge thatit is not representative of the majority of Afghans.   A large number of anti-government Afghans favor the return fromexile of their former monarch, King Zahir Shah, to head atransitional administration that would guide the country to peace.Zahir Shah was ousted in 1973 by the military, which thenestablished the republic that was overthrown by the Marxists in 1978.   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the mujahedeen government andleader of the hardline Ittehad-i-Islami rebel party, rails atproposals for a negotiated settlement.   ``It should be clear that any attempt to solve the Afghan issueagainst the wishes and decisions of the mujahedeen will not only befutile but would also have negative repercussions on Afghanistan andthe region as a whole,'' he said in a statement issued from hisPeshawar office.   ``If the world community wants to end bloodshed in Afghanistanthey should put pressure on the Russians to stop ... propping up aregime which is totally unacceptable to the Afghan nation.''   Some rebel leaders say they are stockpiling weapons and planningattacks on Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other key cities.   The guerrilla offensives that usually herald winter's end haven'thappened this year, except for the attempt to take Jalalabad.   ``No one wants to fight,'' said Massoud, who uses only one name.``Everyone wants a peaceful solution. Zahir Shah does havepopularity as opposed to rebel leaders who want a militarysolution.''   But one Afghan intellectual, who asked not to be identified, saidan alternative to Zahir Shah would be to have Afghan politicians whobelonged to earlier non-communist cabinets take over untilelections, monitored by the United Nations, can be held.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 2</NOTE></DOC>
