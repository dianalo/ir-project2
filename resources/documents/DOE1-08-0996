As the heat sink temperature ofthe associated power plant was increased, the optimum pond temperatureincreased and the corresponding final conversion efficiency decreased.Further, the optimum final conversion efficiency of the present solarpond thermal-energy conversion system was found to be less than 3% underthe meteorological conditions of Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
