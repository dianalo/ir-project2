The Silver Spring, Md.-based operator of motels and nursing homes indicated it will file a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service today seeking a hearing to dispute the penalty imposed by the INS. In a show of solidarity, other lodging companies and trade groups are rallying behind Manor Care.    The challenge is significant for several reasons. It will establish precedents that could affect nearly 200 other businesses that have since been cited by federal authorities for allegedly employing illegal immigrants. Moreover, it will call attention to a serious and growing shortage of low-skill labor in several industries and thus could exert pressure for changing or repealing the year-old law.    &quot;There is a lot at stake here,&quot; said Michael Maggio, an immigration attorney in Washington, D.C. &quot;It's going to be a test of the industry's will to fight the INS.&quot;    The Manor Care dispute involves the company's Quality Inn motel in Arlington, Va., which was the scene of a raid by immigration officials in late September. After visiting the motel twice and giving the company an informal warning and a citation, federal agents arrived unannounced and arrested 17 workers they suspected of being illegal immigrants.    According to Manor Care executives, immigration agents didn't carry arrest warrants when they arrived. Instead, they lined up employees, asked to see identification and searched the motel office for personnel records, the executives said. The 17 employees presumed to be illegal were escorted through the lobby, past motel guests and whisked away in an INS van, Manor Care officials said.    But Manor Care contends that one of the 17 workers was a legal resident and 13 others had been hired before the law went into effect, thus exempting the company from any liability or fines for them. Manor Care said only three workers were found to be illegal, and they were dismissed immediately after the arrest.    The company was fined $1,000 apiece for 11 of the employees. And for allegedly failing to keep required I-9 work eligibility documents on the workers, the company was fined an additional $500 for each of the 11.    The INS won't discuss specifics of the Manor Care case, but the agency insists that it isn't trying to single out any industry or make an example of one company.    &quot;We're trying to use our resources as judiciously as possible,&quot; said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the agency. He acknowledged, however, that because illegal immigrants tend to find work in low-paying jobs, they are heavily concentrated in some businesses, including lodging, restaurants and bars.    The American Hotel and Motel Association, which supports Manor Care's efforts, is lobbying for changes in the law. &quot;We're trying to make the INS aware of the problems of our industry,&quot; said Thomas Youngblood, a member of the association's governmental affairs office in Washington, D.C. &quot;We just can't continue to function in this manner.&quot;    The lodging industry employs about 1.5 million workers in the U.S. and complains of being hit hard by the labor shortage. Rapid growth in the field made the problem worse lately. In the past 12 months, the industry generated an estimated 78,000 new positions, and filling them with qualified workers has been difficult.    So severe is the labor pinch that some lodging concerns, such as Holiday Corp., have had to bus in help from outlying cities just to fill vacancies. A major lodging chain based on the East Coast recently had to fly in housekeepers from the Midwest to a Hartford, Conn., hotel for two weeks because it couldn't find sufficient help locally.    F. Gerald Adams, professor of economics and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, believes the Manor Care case represents the first wave of corporate protest over the new law. He speculated that the shortage of unskilled labor will move industry to seek significant changes in the law.    &quot;There will be such an outcry from industry that the INS will have to change the law, get rid of it completely or stop enforcing it. I'd be very surprised if the law lasted a year,&quot; Mr. Adams said. </TEXT></DOC>
