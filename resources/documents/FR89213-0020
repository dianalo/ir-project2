There is nomajor increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="21">This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance under number 10.420.</ITAG>This program/activity is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 291115, June 24, 1983) and FmHA Instruction1940-J, ``Intergovernmental Review of Farmers Home Administration Programsand Activities'' (December 23, 1983).  This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), theAdministrator of the Farmers Home Administration, has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities because less than 100 rural communities will be affectedannually.The proposed changes to the regulation decrease the role and involvementof the National Office by placing more decision making authority at thestate and district level. The proposal also requires a greater level ofinvolvement by the communities being served than previously required. Itfurther directs the program to assist those most in need of houses, whogenerally are families below 50 percent of area median income, living insubstandard housing and/or otherwise lack the skills to be good homeowners.It requries a greater amount of family participation in the constructionof their own homes. It is anticipated that this change will increase theamount of borrower labor by more than 30 pecent over what was previouslyrequired.It changes the method used for accounting for borrower labor. The currentregulation accounts for borrower labor by the number of hours contributed.The new method accounts for labor by the number of tasks performed. Thismethod permits the use of modern construction techniques whereas the currentregulation discourages their use because it could reduce the number ofhours contributed.It restricts the families who can participate in this program only to thosewho are approved for a section 502 loan. Previously, they could obtainother assistance as well; however, virtually everyone participating inthis program in the past has done so by obtaining a section 502 loan. Therefore,it was decided to drop the reference to other sources of credit.It gives the State Director more flexibility in directing the program tocommunities that may best benefit. The current method of determining thesuccess of the program is based on the amount of saving as the differencebetween the cost of a contract built house and the cost of a self-helpbuilt house. This method has many flaws. It is difficult to establish thebenchmark value, thereby, permitting generous funding of grantees in highcost areas and inadequate funding in low cost areas. As proposed, the StateDirector has greater flexibility in the use of the program and in determiningthe value to be placed on the self-help effort. The State Director cannegotiate with the grantee on the method, amount of borrower contribution,and level of grant funding which will permit the program to be useful inrehabilitation and repair of dwellings.The proposed regulation strengthens the supervision of the grantee by requiringthe grantee to report quarterly on progress and for FmHA to determine whethertheir quarterly progress is on schedule. It requires FmHA to put delinquentgrantees on notice and to offer them assistance so they will be successful.If after a 90 day period, the grantee is still unsuccessful, they willbe terminated. This proposed change should assist more grantees to be successful.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>CFR Part 1933Grant program_Housing and community development, Indians, Low and moderateincome housing, Nonprofit organizations, Rural housing.7 CFR Part 1944Fair housing, Great programs_Housing and community development, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Rural housing.As proposed, Subpart I of Part 1933, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, of the Codeof Federal Regulations is revised and redesignated as Subpart I of Part1944 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1933_LOAN AND GRANT PROGRAM (GROUP)</ITAG>1.

To help such personshave an adequate home at a cost they can afford, the Farmers Home Administration(FmHA) makes Rural Housing (RH) loans to individual persons to enable themto participate in a mutual self-help housing project. This program is designedto help families, that otherwise do not qualify as homeowners, work togetherto build modest homes of their own.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Eligible applicants may obtain rural housing loans to buy materials,pay for labor and contract costs required for work on their own homes,and if necessary, buy a building site. Families helping each other willprovide most of the construction labor. The exchange of labor, withouta cash cost to the families, is the key to the mutual self-help housingprogram. The also may be a savings in the cost of materials purchased.This use of family labor for cash can reduce the cost of homes enough tobring the price of a modest home within reach of very low-income ruralfamilies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Leadership and Supervisiond</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The grantee will provide the leadership and supervision of the families.FmHA will determine who is eligible to participate and receive a RuralHousing loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Rural housing loans will be made by FmHA to those who participatein a self-help housing group and who:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Meet the low or very low-income requirements in Exhibit C to (availablein any FmHA office) subpart A of part 1944 of this chapter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Are creditworthy by FmHA standards and can comply with all othereligibility requirements for rural housing loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Desire to build a home of their own that is modest in design, structurallysound, and low in cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following basic conditions are essential to the success of a self-helphousing venture and must be provided by the grantee:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. A sincere spirit of cooperation on the part of all participants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Competent leadership and technical supervision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. A complete understanding of the responsibilties involved in MutualSelf-Help.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Adequate supervision of participants at times convenient for thefamilies to do the work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Development of sufficient skills among the members of the groupto do the basic construction tasks as outlined in Exhibit C-2 of this subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Four to 10 families who can and are willing to work together satisfactorily.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Organization and Agreements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An understanding must be reached on important items such as when theindividuals in the group will be available to work, the amount of workto be performed, the number to be involved in the various work groups andthe amount of time each will spend working on the homes. The group willdevelop a written agreement which is binding upon all members signing it.Exhibit B-1, Membership Agreement, is a suggested form of such an agreement.All participating members will sign the Membership Agreement and each applicantwill be given a copy. If a document is used which is different than ExhibitB-1, it must be reviewed and approved by FmHA for legal adequacy and compliancewith applicable State laws and FmHA regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Preconstruction Meetings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The successful conduct of a mutual self-help housing program requiresa series of meetings with those participating. These meetings are to discussthe planning, construction, and maintenance of a home, the responsibilitiesof home ownership, and the requirements for a FmHA rural housing loan.These meetings also familiarize the applicants with the self-help approach,develop mutual confidences among participants and develop the interestof community leaders in the project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The actual number of meetings held will depend on the rate at whichthe group progresses toward reaching a full understanding of the responsibiltiesinvolved. Experience indicates that from 8 to 10 meetings are needed. Localpeople should be used to discuss appropriate subjects in the meetings.This will help in making the local community aware of the self-help program,and also help obtain local acceptance and support for the project. Thefollowing is a recommended sequence of meetings and a suggested list ofsubjects to be discussed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The first meeting should be explanatory in nature. The grantee shoulddiscuss the basic principles involved in mutual self-help housing, togetherwith a brief explanation of the purposes and limitations of and the requirementsfor rural housing loans including loan payments, taxes, insurance, andmaintenance. The members of the group should be considering a name forthe organization and the persons best suited for the various positionsin order that the officers and committees can be selected at the next meeting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the second meeting, an association should be formed and the officersand committees selected. They might include the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. President</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Vice-President</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Secretary-Treasurer</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Labor Manager</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Purchasing Committee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Program Committee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additional meetings are essential, but the order in which the subjectsare presented or the number of subjects included in any meeting may vary.The following topics are suggested for a series of meetings:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Site planning and building codes. </T3>An architect, code official,or a good builder could be invited to discuss factors in selecting housesize, safety, and health code requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Plans and specifications. </T3>The group will probably have questionsand need individual help in making decisions concerning plans and specificationsfor their homes. The construction supervisor should help each applicantdevelop suitable plans that will meet the household's individual need andthe requirement of andSection; 1944.16 of Subpart A of 7 CFR Part 1944.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Cost of materials. </T3>The purchasing committee will review pricesof materials and contract work. At one of the last meetings to be heldbefore the construction starts, the purchasing committee should reporton its recommendations for buying materials and awarding contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Taxes. </T3>A discussion of the method of tax appraising could be givenby the local tax assessor including an estimate of expected taxes on theproposed houses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Insurance. </T3>A local insurance agent may be asked to speak on typesof insurance policies available such as fire and extended coverage, householdpolicies, and liability insurance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Mortgage requirements. </T3>The grantee should discuss the FmHA mortgageand related requirements. A local attorney might be asked to discuss otherlegal aspects of the program.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Maintenance costs. </T3>The construction supervisor should discussthe importance of proper maintenance for a home. They should emphasizehow money spent for maintenance improves appearance, helps maintain valueand saves money in the long run.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Money management. </T3>The grantee discuss the necessity of followingthe basic principles of money management such as keeping records, followinga budget, and not overspending on non-essentials.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Labor sharing arrangement. </T3>The group needs to reach an understandingas to how the memmbers will share labor, how records will be kept of timeworked, how to make sure that labor will be exchanged on a basis that isfair to all members and how to evidence and record these decisions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>Use of tools. </T3>One or more of the meetings should include demonstrationsand training by the construction supervisor of the safe and proper useof tools. Special attention should be given to the use of basic tools suchas level, square, rule, saw, and any power tools that might be used inthe construction.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. <T3>Construction and work procedures. </T3>The authority and duties ofthe construction supervisor will be discussed in detail. The proceduresfor actual construction will be discussed including labor sharing, workteams, order of development, function of committees, time reporting forwork completed and future hours available.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. <T3>Ground breaking plans. </T3>The final preconstruction meeting shouldbe more of a social get-together than a businesss meeting. This is alsothe logical time to plan a ground breaking ceremony for the day the loansare closed.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"/><T3>Construction  </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">The basic work is performed, largely on a labor exchange basis, bythe participating families under the guidance of the construction supervisor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The group may, depending on the skills of the individuals, plan todo as much of the work as possible such as installing kitchen cabinetsand equipment, excavating for basements, and dry-wall finishing. Highlyskilled or specialized jobs will be contracted when such services are notavailable in the group.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Work should start on all houses and each stage of construction befinished on all before starting the next stage of construction on any house,to the extent with good construction practices, except as provided in paragraph3, Labor Exchange Agreement of the Membership Agreement (Exhibit B-1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To effect savings, materials for all the houses may be purchased fromthe one or several suppliers who offer the lowest prices. Also, all contractsfor members of the group may be awarded to the same contractors. To illustrate,the plumbing contractor offering the lowest price ordinarily should performthe plumbing for all of the dwellings.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each borrower will pay the material supplier for materials used, andthe contractor for work done, on his/her own home. All deliveries of materialswill be <T3>itemized separately </T3>for each home. The grantee, after consideringthe suggestions of the purchasing committee, will recommend the suppliersfrom whom materials will be purchased and the contractors to whom the contractswill be awarded.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The construction supervisor will divide the group into work teams.Work teams should be organized on the basis of skills, compatability, andavailability. For example, one team could lay out and pour footings andanother team could lay bricks. The third team could begin framing as soonas the foundation is ready.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firm understanding will be reached that no changes in constructionfrom the approved plans and specifications may be made without furnishingthe Country Supervisor with full cost figures and obtaining approval inadvance. If any cahnge results in a need for additional funds, they mustbe furnished by the borrower before approval. All homes should be finishedat or about the same time and none should be occupied prior to completionof them all.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Association should have brief meetings, at least once a week,to:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Report on performance and hours of work performed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Settle any disagreements.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

Equivalent units are used to measure progress at any time duringthe period of the grant. It is necessary because self-help grantees haveseveral groups of families in various stages of progress during the periodof the grant.

Using the<T3> Description of Phase Breakdown</T3> as a guide, the project staffselects the total percentage pertinent to the stage the self-help groupis in and multiplies that percentage by the number of families (units)in the group. The result is the<T3> equivalent number of units completed.</T3> No credit may be givenfor Phase I, if the application is rejected. When this computation hasbeen completed for each group that falls within Phase I-III, the totalnumber of equivalent units is divided into the total grant funds<T3> expended</T3> to that date. The result is the TA cost per unit atthat stage of the program's progress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The definition of pre-construction and construction phases describedare as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Pre-Construction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Phase I:</T3> Hold community meetings; conduct interviews; obtain houseplans; prepare cost estimates; begin search for land; submit family applicationsto the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA); FmHA runs credit check; applications.FmHA either approves or rejects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Phase II:</T3> Organize an association of section 502 RH eligible families;association conducts weekly meetings at which required FmHA forms are discussedand completed; house plans and land sites are selected; outside speakersexplain and discuss taxes, insurance, how to keep a checking account, howinterest is computed, home maintenance, decorating, and landscaping; etc.;completed loan dockets for each family are submitted to FmHA. Family loandockets are reviewed and recommendations made as to the loan amounts requested;the FmHA County Supervisor reviews family loan dockets; preliminary titlesearch of each proposed building site is begun; requests loan check fromFinance Office; when check arrives, final title search is made, loan closed,checking accounts opened, and construction begun.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Construction:</T3> The grantee will utilize Exhibit C-2 which outlines27 construction tasks to determine the percentage of completed constructionactivities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D.

For example, if there are eight families in Group andplusmin;2and all have completed the 20 percent phase of preconstruction, then therewould be 1.6 EU's in the pre-construction phase of the program as of thatdate.
