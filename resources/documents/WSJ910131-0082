But some investors seemto have found a special edge that suggests they have insideinformation about market-moving corporate news.   Several times this month alone, prices of specificcompanies' high-yield junk bonds have surged a day or twobefore bullish news has become public. Company officials saythey don't know of any leaks and are puzzled by the runups.The sudden jumps, however, are catching the attention ofregulators and veteran junk-bond analysts.</LP><TEXT>   During the week of Jan. 21, for example, Harcourt BraceJovanovich Inc.'s 13% bonds jumped $150 for each $1,000 faceamount. Buyers began snapping up the bonds on Wednesday, Jan.22, when the bonds climbed $20 apiece in the absence of anynews about the debt-laden company. Those astute early buyerswere quickly rewarded; details of General Cinema Corp.'splans to buy HBJ for $1.4 billion emerged Jan. 23 and 24,sending the bonds soaring much higher.   Such uncanny timing &quot;is very irritating,&quot; says MarielClemensen, head of high-yield research at Citicorp. Shebelieves that trading on advance knowledge of market-movinginformation &quot;is pretty widespread&quot; in the junk bond market.&quot;The problem is, everything you hear is anecdotal,&quot; she says.&quot;You can never quite nail down cases.&quot;   The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission'senforcement division, William McLucas, says junk bond tradingpractices may merit a look by his department. &quot;This couldfall under the scope of insider trading law,&quot; Mr. McLucassays. While bond-related insider trading cases are scarce, hesays, the SEC did bring one such case in the mid-1980s.   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the SenateCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, earlier thismonth asked the SEC to review junk bond trading.   Mr. McLucas said his agency hasn't formally responded toSen. Riegle, but he says: &quot;Given what's happened in the pasttwo years&quot; with chaotic conditions in the junk bond market,&quot;the issue of fraud in trading is more acute.&quot;   A thorny issue for regulators, though, will be how much ofinsider-trading case law -- which has been built up almostentirely in cases involving common stocks -- applies totrading in a company's bonds. &quot;There are analyticdifferences,&quot; Mr. McLucas says.   The cornerstone of insider-trading law, Rule 10-b-5 underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, applies to any securitylisted on an exchange or otherwise, notes Harvey Pitt, apartner in the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris Shriver andamp;Jacobson and a former SEC general counsel. &quot;So there's noreason inherently that insider-trading law shouldn't apply tojunk bonds,&quot; Mr. Pitt says.   Still, Mr. Pitt says: &quot;With clients over the years,questions (about potential insider trading) relating to debtissues have been much more difficult than those relating toequities.&quot; Plenty of existing case law bars insiders fromtrading stocks on advance knowledge of market-sensitive news,or tipping off other people about the news, he explains. Butsome of those breach-of-confidence standards may be harder toapply in bond-market trading, Mr. Pitt contends.   Even keeping track of trading is far tougher in junk bondsthan in the stock market. There isn't any central junk bondexchange with posted prices, minute-by-minute, as there is inthe stock market. Instead, all junk bond trading is doneover-the-counter by dealers. That makes it tough forregulators to monitor trading -- as is done in the stockmarket -- for unusual bursts of activity before news.   Within the junk bond market, there is a wide variety ofmarket-sensitive information. Companies often share privatefinancial data with their investment bankers, or with acreditors' committee if they have defaulted on their debt.Such groups are supposed to keep information confidential andavoid trading on the basis of what they learn.   Although the legal issues remain murky, junk bondinvestors and analysts continue to stockpile examples ofprescient buying or selling of bonds ahead of newsannouncements.   On Nov. 15, Fort Howard Corp. said it would shore up itsbalance sheet with a $250 million equity infusion and buyback some of its junk bonds. That was a boon to bondholders,who that day bid up the paper company's 12 3/8% bonds of 1997by $80 for each $1,000 face amount. But the bonds had alreadybegun climbing the day before, when nothing was public.   A Fort Howard spokesman says he hasn't heard of anythingthat would explain the bonds' pre-announcement rise.   Harcourt Brace's chief of investor relations, AnsonFranklin, was equally perplexed by the rise in the publishingcompany's bonds last week, before reports appeared in printthat the company was about to be sold. Monitoring phone callsfrom HBJ investors, &quot;I never picked up anything thatsuggested anyone was close to the mark,&quot; Mr. Franklin says.&quot;Frankly, I was surprised that the story kept quiet as longas it did.&quot;   Also catching some bond-market participants' attention wasa runup last week in a relatively obscure RJR Nabisco Inc.junk issue, the company's 8 5/8% bonds of 2017. Those bondsgot a lift when RJR announced Jan. 23 that it settled abondholder suit brought by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Aspart of that settlement, RJR agreed to shorten the potentialmaturity of the bond to 2002, making the relativelylow-yielding bond more valuable to investors.   The RJR bonds jumped more than $20 for each $1,000 faceamount the day the settlement was announced. But two daysearlier, before anything was public, the bonds had climbedmore than $25.   Both RJR and Metropolitan Life say they are baffled by thepremature rise. &quot;Hardly anyone knew about this beforehand,&quot;says Harry Kamen, Metropolitan Life's general counsel. &quot;Thiswas one of the most closely guarded settlements in thehistory of the information age,&quot; says an RJR spokesman.   Companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings alsohave bonds that can still show unexpected life. SouthlandCorp.'s 13 1/2% bonds due 1995 jumped $40 for each $1,000face amount Jan. 22, when the operator of 7-Eleven storesannounced that bondholders had agreed to modify the company'sreorganization plan. The day before, though, when nothing waspublic, the bonds had climbed $10.   &quot;We don't know the reason for the movement in our bonds,&quot;a Southland spokeswoman says.</TEXT></DOC>
