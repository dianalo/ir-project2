Three weeks ago, Finex, the upstart division of thevenerable New York Cotton Exchange, stepped up to offer nearround-the-clock trading in some of the financial products itlists. Finex's step is hardly a small feat. For severalyears, the giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the ChicagoBoard of Trade have been struggling with Reuters to develop a24-hour electronic trading system known as Globex. One glitchafter another has kept the project from seeing the light ofday.</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, Finex's system is far less ambitious and muchless costly to set up than Globex. But its customers aretaking notice.   Michael Moss, president of Index Futures Group Inc., aChicago-based futures broker, says Index Futures has almostdoubled the volume of trading it does in the dollar indexcontract since Finex extended its hours. &quot;This is business wewouldn't be able to do without the advantage of 24-hourtrading,&quot; he says.   Mr. Moss isn't alone. In the first week of overnighttrading, average daily volume in Finex's most popularcontract, U.S. dollar index futures, jumped 62% from theaverage daily turnover during this year's first two months.Of the first-week volume, 30% occurred during the overnightsession.   Finex trading runs from 7 p.m. Eastern time to 10 p.m.,then breaks while traders in Tokyo go to lunch. It resumesagain at 11:30 p.m. and continues through till 3 p.m. thenext day. The exchange is closed from 3 p.m. Friday to 7 p.m.Sunday. &quot;Overnight&quot; volume counts contracts traded in theevening session and in the period between 11:30 p.m. and8:19:59 a.m.   Though exchange officials say they can't tell how much ofthe overnight volume is new business, anecdotal evidencesuggests that some of it is.   Hunt Taylor, managing director at Duich Investment Co., aSan Francisco commodity trading adviser, had personallytraded the dollar-index contract even before the exchangewent to round-the-clock trading.   But &quot;we had never put clients into the index,&quot; says Mr.Taylor, who is also a member of Finex's board, &quot;basicallybecause we needed the opportunity to execute trades duringthe European and Asian trading time zones.&quot; Mr. Taylor saysthe company felt it was &quot;imprudent&quot; for it to take risk onthe behalf of clients when it &quot;couldn't liquidate a positionif breaking news like the Gorbachev coup happened outside ofour time zones.&quot;   Since Finex has extended its hours, Mr. Taylor's companyhas started doing business in the dollar index contract onbehalf of clients.   Though on average about 30% of the exchange's total volumein the dollar index contract has been coming from the nightsession, it has accounted for almost half on some days. Forinstance, on March 5, the day before the February employmentreport, volume in the overnight session surged to 46%.   Peter Borish, director of research at Tudor InvestmentCorp., a large commodity trading adviser that trades thedollar index contract, says on days when there are importanteconomic reports due out, the overnight session &quot;gives youthe opportunity to take advantage {of the situation} orsquare your positions.&quot; Incidentally, the head of TudorInvestment, Paul Tudor Jones, is chairman of Finex -- acircumstance that some industry observers say contributes tothe small exchange's success.   Unlike the computer-terminal trading to be offered on theGlobex system, whose start-up has slipped to &quot;sometime thisyear,&quot; Finex's round-the-clock trading venture relies solelyon &quot;open outcry.&quot; Brokers yell out bids and offers to findappropriate levels at which to execute trades.   &quot;Most futures markets are assumed to be made liquid bylocals,&quot; says Richard Jaycobs, managing director at Finex.Locals are floor traders who, in trading frequently for theirown accounts, often provide the opposite sides of tradeorders coming into a market from off the floor. But in thewee hours on Finex, Mr. Jaycobs says, &quot;you don't have anylocals.&quot;   To ensure that traders can find somebody ready to dobusiness in the night session, two companies act as marketmakers. Chicago Research andamp; Trading Group Ltd. and GeldermannAssociate Partners have pledged to buy or sell a minimumnumber of contracts at a specified difference between the bidand ask prices at all times.   At some periods during the night, particularly between 4a.m. and 8 a.m., when the London foreign exchange market isopen and the New York market is starting to wake up, many ofthe brokers on the Finex night patrol say the markets are&quot;very tight,&quot; meaning small differences between the bid andask prices.   &quot;I was actually surprised -- a couple of nights somebodyyelled out: `It's a tighter market than during the day,'&quot;says Michael Mareneck, a floor trader for M.One, a brokerageconcern.   However, some in the industry say the extended tradinghours has made the dollar index contract more attractive onlyto smaller and medium-sized commodity trading advisers, notthe big ones. These big players have accounts large enough totrade through big international banks.   &quot;When you've got the interbank market, why do you need thedollar index?&quot; asks Peter Matthews, chief portfoliostrategist at Mint Investment Management Co.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Iraq will be in the news again this week, and oil marketsare likely to react. United Nations and Iraqi representativesare to meet in Vienna Thursday to renew discussions on a U.N.proposal that would allow Iraq an emergency sale of oil forhumanitarian purposes.   If it appears that the talks aren't going to resolve theIraq-U.N. standoff over terms of the sale, petroleum pricesmay firm up again. But any indication that the U.N. ban onIraqi oil exports may be lifted, even temporarily, coulddrive down prices. &quot;A resumption of oil exports by Iraq --however unlikely -- would shake the markets to theirfoundations,&quot; reported the London-based Energy Compass.   A sample of the bearish impact Iraq can have on oilmarkets came Friday. News that it agreed to U.N. demands onweapons destruction sent oil futures sharply lower in bothNew York and London. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, theexpiring April crude contract fell 39 cents to $18.90 abarrel. May crude dropped 38 cents to $19.09 a barrel. Somebrokers said the sell-off, which reversed last week's upwardprice trend, may spill over into today's trading.   Another Persian Gulf producer, Iran, may share in theattention of oil analysts this week. The Weekly PetroleumArgus will report today that, after a review by Iran'sPresident Rafsanjani, National Iranian Oil Co. is to lose itsmonopoly over the country's oil sector because of mistakesmade in marketing oil. &quot;Meanwhile, Gholamreza Aghazadeh'sfuture as oil minister remains uncertain and is unlikely tobe resolved until after Iran's elections&quot; on April 10, theLondon-based oil industry publication will report.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Futures prices ended last week on a bearish note. The Maycontract fell 1.15 cents a pound Friday to $1.0080. WilliamO'Neill, senior futures analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures inNew York, says that over the past few weeks copper orderbooks that had been fairly full during February have startedto thin noticeably &quot;because both North American and FarEastern users reduced their demand for physical copper.&quot;   In addition, he notes that copper from the former SovietUnion, the Commonwealth of Independent States, is starting toappear in the West. &quot;We can reasonably expect to see as muchas 25,000 tons show up in London warehouse stocks in thecoming weeks,&quot; says Mr. O'Neill. He explains that theavailability of this additional copper could easily offsetthe &quot;good news from increased housing starts in the U.S.&quot; Healso notes that the labor unrest in Peru that resulted in atwo-day strike last week has been resolved, at least for now.   Mr. O'Neill says that he sees the market continuing underpressure this week with the May contract finding support ataround 99 cents and meeting resistance at about $1.0150. &quot;Ibelieve that this short-term shakeout offers a good buyingopportunity for copper bulls who are looking toward astronger third and fourth quarter,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          The Agriculture Department is expected to report Fridaythat the nation's hog and pig herd is continuing to expand ata rapid rate.   Dan Vaught, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons,said he expects the government's quarterly survey to showthat the U.S. pork population is 5% larger compared with ayear ago.   The outlook for expanding supplies of pork has helpeddepress prices of hog futures contracts this year. The reportis also expected to show that the number of pigs born fromDecember to February increased 7% compared with theyear-earlier period.   The cattle market, meanwhile, continues to face relativelytight supplies for fattened animals. A monthly seven-statefeedlot survey released by the Agriculture Department afterthe close of trading Friday showed that 8% fewer cattle werebeing fattened for slaughter on March 1 compared with theyear-ago date.   However, cattle prices might come under pressure at theopen of trading today because the survey detected a 1% risein the number of young cattle placed onto feedlots inFebruary compared with the year-earlier month. The reportsubstantiates recent speculation that the rise in cattleprices this year is beginning to encourage feedlot owners tofatten more animals for slaughter.</TEXT></DOC>
