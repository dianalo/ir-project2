The Act is administered by the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) through the Office of Ocean and Coastal ResourceManagement (OCRM), Marine and Estuarine Management Division (MEMD). Selectionof a site as an Active Candidate formally triggers the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) environmental impact analysis process.On November 7, 1988, Pub. L. 100-627, the reauthorization of Title IIIof the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C.1431 et seq.) (``the Act''), was signed into law. Section 205 of Pub. L.100-627 directs that the Secretary of Commerce designate the Monterey BayNational Marine Sanctuary no later than December 31, 1989. This directiveby Congress automatically advances Monterey Bay to Active Candidate status.Subsequent steps include a public hearing, preparation of a final environmentalimpact statement and management plan and a recommendation of approval tothe Secretary of Commerce. Opportunities for comment exist throughout thisprocess and will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the local media, and other appropriate channels.Section 303 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433) and regulations for the NationalMarine Sanctuary Program (at 15 CFR 922.33) establish procedures for theevaluation of the suitability of Active Candidates as National Marine Sanctuaries.In developing the Sanctuary proposal, NOAA will determine to what extentdesignation will fulfill the purposes and policies of section 303(a) ofthe Act; and whether:(1) The area is of special national significance due to its resource orhuman-use values;(2) Existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate to ensure coordinatedand comprehensive conservation and management of the area, including resourceprotection, scientific research and public education;(3) Designation of the area as a National Marine Sanctuary will facilitatecoordinated and comprehensive conservation and management of the area,including resource protection, scientific research and public education;and(4) The area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive andcoordinated conservation and management. Further, based on section 303(b)of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433), NOAA will consider:(1) The area's natural resource and ecological qualities, including itscontribution to biological productivity, maintenance of ecosystem structure,maintenance of ecologically or commercially important or threatened speciesor species assemblages, and the biographic representation of the site;(2) The area's historical, cultural, archeological, or paleontologicalsignificance; (3) The present and potential uses of the area that depend on maintenanceof the area's resources, including commercial and recreational fishing,subsistence uses, other commercial and recreational activities, and researchand education; (4) The present and potential activities that may adversely affect thefactors identified in the consideration listed above; (5) The existing State and Federal regulatory and management authoritiesapplicable to the area and the adequacy of those authorities to fulfillthe purposes and policies of the Act; (6) The manageability of the area, including such factors as its size,its ability to be identified as a discrete ecological unit with definableboundaries, its accessibility, and its suitability for monitoring and enforcementactivities; (7) The public benefits to be derived from Sanctuary status, with emphasison the benefits of long-term protection of nationally significant resources,vital habitats, and resources which generate tourism; (8) The negative impacts produced by management restrictions on income-generatingactivities such as living and non-living resources development; (9) The socioeconomic effects of Sanctuary designation; and (10) The fiscal capability of NOAA to manage the area as a National MarineSanctuary. In preparing the environmental impact statement and management plan (EIS/MP)to examine the management and regulatory alternatives associated with Sanctuarydesignation, NOAA will solicit comments from interested persons, groupsand organizations, heads of interested Federal agencies, and responsibleofficials of State and local governments. This will be done during scopingmeetings to be held in the Monterey Bay area, prior to preparation of theEIS/MP, and during public hearings to receive comments on the draft EIS/MP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Past History </ITAG>The State of California nominated the Monterey Bay area in 1977, alongwith nine other marine areas offshore for consideration as National MarineSanctuaries. In response to these nominations, NOAA selected three sitesfor further consideration: Channel Islands, Point Reyes-Farallon Islands,and the Monterey Bay area. In December 1978, NOAA released an Issue Paperon these three sites, presenting several boundary and regulatory optionsfor each proposal. Public hearings on the Issue Paper were held and, basedon the responses, NOAA declared all three sites as Active Candidates onAugust 10, 1979. This process led to the designation of the Channel Islands National MarineSanctuary on September 21, 1980, and the Point Reyes-Farallons IslandsNational Marine Sanctuary (later renamed Gulf of the Farallones NationalMarine Sanctuary) on January 16, 1981. In 1980, NOAA determined that workon the proposed Monterey Bay Sanctuary would be delayed due to the complexanalyses and corresponding staff time required for the other two Californiasites. On December 14, 1983, NOAA removed Monterey Bay from the list of activecandidates for three reasons: (1) The existence of two other National MarineSanctuaries in California (Channel Islands and Gulf of the Farallones)which protect similar marine resources and the Program's policy, establishedin 1980, to consider a diverse array of sites and resources; (2) the proposedarea's relatively large size and the surveillance and enforcement burdensthis would impose on NOAA; and (3) the wealth of existing marine conservationprograms already in place in the Monterey Bay area. In 1988, when Congress reauthorized and amended Title III of the Act, itspecified in section 205 of Pub. L. 100-627, that NOAA designate MontereyBay as a National Marine Sanctuary by December 31, 1989. This statutoryrequirement has therefore reinstated Monterey Bay as an Active Candidatefor Sanctuary status. <ITAG tagnum="84">Natural Resources </ITAG>Monterey Bay is located within the Eastern Pacific Boreal Region whichincorporates a vast area of the North Pacific, and more specifically, withinthe Oregonian biogeographical province encompassing the North Americancoast from Point Conception to the Canadian border. The Sanctuary studyarea includes the coastal waters between Pigeon Point, San Mateo County(37anddegrees;11andmin172;N, 122anddegrees;24andmin172;W) and Point Sur in MontereyCounty (36anddegrees;18andmin172;N, 121anddegrees;52andmin172;W) and extendingfrom the mean high tide line from these sites seaward 14.5 nautical mileson a heading of 240anddegrees;. Oceanographic Characteristics Typical of the Oregonian province, the Bay is strongly influenced by cool,relatively clear waters dominated by the California current. The MontereySubmarine Canyon results in a strong upwelling of nutrient-rich water.Consequently, the nearshore waters are highly productive, supporting diversefloral and faunal assemblages. Circulation within the Bay is influenced by a variety of factors: offshorecurrents, seasonal periods of upwelling, winds, the Monterey SubmarineCanyon, and river discharges.Geological Features and Habitat The area is characterized by a narrow continental shelf fringed by a varietyof coastal types. The underlying rock types range from pre-Tertiary graniteswith some intrusions south of Monterey Bay to softer sedimentary rocksunderlying Monterey Bay and areas to the north. Covering these rocks inmost areas are three sedimentary types: rocky substrate dominate in nearshoreareas north and south of Monterey Bay; fine sand and coarser sand are foundin the Bay's nearshore areas; and mud which predominates offshore exceptfor a large sandy shelf extending off Point Sur. The Monterey SubmarineCanyon has a mixture of mud and sand with some rock outcrops. Fringingthe waters of the area, the shoreline ranges from rocky and mountainoussouth of the Bay to sand dunes from Seaside north to Moss Landing and tosand bluffs to the north. There are also numerous small and some largerivers that empty into the Bay with one large estuary, Elkhorn Slough,and several smaller ones. While there are submarine canyons elsewhere in the Oregonian province,the Monterey Submarine Canyon is unique in its size, configuration, andproximity to shore. This canyon, along with adjacent submarine canyons,enriches local water through strong seasonal upwellings, modifies currentsand provides habitat for pelagic communities. Monterey Bay itself is arare geological feature along the Pacific coast as it is one of the fewlarge bays. This fact lends additional importance to this area as a restingand staging area for migrating birds. The diversity of rock types, sediment types and shoreline characteristicsin combination with the nutrient rich waters and substantial underwaterrelief all combine to form several habitat assemblages. This variety ofassemblages is one of the major determinants of the rich intertidal andsubtidal communities and represents the range of habitats to be found inthe Oregonian province. Flora and Fauna Monterey Bay has a highly diverse floral and faunal component. Algal diversityis extremely high and the concentrations of pinnipeds and some seabirdsis outstanding. The fish stock, particularly in Monterey Bay, is rich andthe variety of crustaceans is high. The Bay has the most diverse algal community in North America, with about450 to 500 species of west coast algae represented. The diversity of habitatassemblages, rich nutrients close to shore, the high quality waters andthe location of the Bay quite close to the overlap of the Californian andOregonian biogeographic provinces, account for this diversity. The habitats created by the variety of substrate, kelp beds, the canyoncomplex and the nutrient rich waters support rich fish stocks and substantialinvertebrate populations. The various environments within the study areasupport different fish communities, with Monterey Bay and the graniticsubstrate just to the south supporting the highest diversity. The invertebratediversity also reflects the variety of habitat types. Over 300 speciesof invertebrates have been reported off Point AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo. The area also supports one of the greatest diversities of marine mammalsin the world. Among these are several endangered species, including theCalifornia gray whale (<T3>Eschrichtius robustus</T3>), finback whale (<T3>Balaenoptera physalus</T3>), humpback whale (<T3>Megaptera novaeangliae</T3>), sperm whale (<T3>Physeter catodon</T3>), and the threatened California sea otter (<T3>Enhydra lutris</T3>). All species of pinnipeds commonly found off the central and northern Californiacoast are found in the Monterey Bay area. AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo is one ofthe most important sites and has been cited as the most important pinnipedrookery and resting area in central and northern California. The area also encompasses approximately one-third of the entire sea otterrange in California. The majority of otters are found south of the MontereyPeninsula (females and pups) with the northern peripheral group of theentire population found between Soquel Point and Elkhorn Slough. Most of the cetacean species known to frequent the central and northernCalifornia coast have been sighted in the area. Many, such as the graywhale, pass through the area while on a northerly or southerly migratoryroute. However, the edge of the canyon complex does serve as an excellentfeeding area due to strong nutrient upwellings. Monterey Bay plays a major role for avifauna as a staging habitat duringboth migrations and as wintering and summer habitat. Bird species diversityis very high. The area is attractive due to the nutrient waters and resultingrich food resources, the protected bay environment, and location alongthe Pacific flyway. Breeding populations are generally small and scattered.The entire world population of the Ashy Storm-Petrel (<T3>Oceanodroma homochroa</T3>) (5000-10,000) can be found feeding in thearea immediately above the Monterey Submarine Canyon from August to November.Critical Habitat Critical habitats are areas that are essential for spawning and breedingand are crucial to the survival of particular species. Because of the highlyproductive waters of the Bay area, several critical habitats have beenidentified in Monterey Bay and its surrounding waters. The California sea otter is an endangered species whose females and pupsare found primarily in the sheltered coves south of Monterey Peninsula.The highest densities of otters occur in rocky nearshore areas within the20 meter isobath in the dense kelp canopy. These areas have been identifiedas critical breeding and feeding locations essential to existence of currentand future populations of sea otters. Earth's entire population of Ashy Storm-Petrels feed over the MontereyCanyon from August to November. Waters over the canyon are a critical feedingarea that is important to survival of the species. Point AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo is a critical breeding habitat for elephant seals(<T3>Migrounga anguestirostris</T3>), Stellar sea lions (<T3>Eumatopias jubata</T3>) and harbor seals (<T3>Phoca vitulina</T3>). AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo Island, with its small surfacearea, is the focus of virtually all pinniped breeding activity taking placein the area, and may be the key to the continued survival of these populationsin central and northern California.AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo Island is also a critical habitat for breeding elephantseals as well as the mainland Point AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo. The marine environmentimmediately around the island and mainland point may also be critical.However, the extent of feeding activity taking place in the waters nearthe island is unknown. There are other very important sites, including the spawning grounds ofthe market squid (<T3>Loligo opalescens</T3>) in Monterey Bay and the nesting sites for seabirdsalong the shoreline and on small offshore rocks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Human Uses</ITAG>Research Opportunities The biological and physical characteristics of Monterey Bay combine toprovide outstanding opportunities for scientific research on many aspectsof marine ecosystems. The diverse habitats are readily accessible to researchers.Six major research facilities are found in the area. These institutionsare exceptional resources with a long history of research and large databasespossessing a considerable amount of baseline information on the Bay andits resources. The Hopkins Marine Station is located in Pacific Grove. As part of StanfordUniversity, its primary research efforts focus on cellular and developmentalbiology, immunology, and neurobiology of intertidal organisms. Other researchis focused on the ecology of the rocky intertidal zone of the Hopkins MarineLife Refuge offshore of the laboratory grounds. The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University is locatedalong the central coast of Monterey Bay. Its researchers conduct a varietyof research including oceanography, ichthyology, marine algae, invertebrates,and marine mammal and seabird behavior. The Laboratory operates the R/V<T3>Point Sur </T3>for its oceanographic research. The Long Marine Laboratories and the Center for Coastal and Marine Studiesof the University of California at Santa Cruz also conduct a variety ofresearch projects on topics such as cetaceans, pinnipeds (especially atAnandCx.174;6o Nuevo), sea otters, invertebrates, and plankton. The Naval Postgraduate School is located near downtown Monterey and isoperated by the United States Navy. The research focus at this institutionis exclusively on physical oceanography. The school shares access to theoceanographic research vessel maintained by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory.The Granite Canyon Marine Laboratory, located along the Big Sur coastlinejust south of Carmel, is operated by the California Department of Fishand Game. Its primary research emphasis is on aquaculture and water qualitymonitoring. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a privately owned institution with a varietyof research interests focused on the Bay and the Monterey Canyon. The recentestablishment of the Monterey Bay Research Institute, the Monterey BayAquarium's research arm, will enable the Aquarium to devote resources tostudying several aspects of the Bay's ecosystems. Extensive research isplanned to examine the Monterey Canyon via a remote-operated unmanned submersible.Other research efforts will be wide-ranging and include biological, chemical,physical, and geological oceanography and studies on the canyon's benthicand pelagic habitats.Tourism and Recreational Uses The diverse resources of Monterey Bay are enjoyed by the residents of thisarea as well as the numerous visitors. The population of Monterey and SantaCruz countries was 544,000 in 1985 and is projected to increase to 755,000by 2005. The projected growth is based in large part on the attractivenessof the area's natural beauty. Since the late 1800's, Monterey Bay has served as a major tourist destination.The most recent estimate of visitors to the area by the Association ofMonterey Bay Area Governments was approximately 18 million annually, indicatingthe important role tourism plays in supporting the local economy. The 16 State beaches along the Bay's shoreline attracted over 3.5 millionvisitors during the last six months of 1986. The Monterey Bay Aquarium,opened in 1984, attracts nearly 2 million visitors annually. The ElkhornSlough National Estuarine Research Reserve operates an interpretive centerwhich serves 30,000 to 40,000 visitors per year. The AnandCx.174;6o NeuvoState Reserve has an interpretive center and offers guided tours aroundthe Reserve to observe the elephant seal breeding colonies establishedon the mainland. Annual visitors to this area number approximately 150,000.The Point Lobos State Reserve just south of Carmel receives approximately300,000 visitors per year.Commercial and Industrial Uses The area also supports several economic activities. The most importantactivity directly dependent on the resources is commerical fishing, whichplayed an important role in the history of Monterey Bay and continues tobe an important activity. Landings in excess of 10 million dollars aremade yearly and account for approximately five percent of the total Californiaharvest. Fishing takes place throughout the Bay and its offshore waters.The major commercial finfish species are the northern anchovy (<T3>Eugraulis Mordax</T3>), rockfish (<T3>Sebastes sps</T3>), mackerel (<T3>Trachurus symmetricus</T3>), albacore tuna (<T3>Thunnus alalunga</T3>), salmon (<T3>Salmonidae</T3>), and sablefish (<T3>Anoplopoma timbria</T3>). Squid are primarily in the southern halfof the Bay and along the Big Sur coast. The commerical fisheries catchof 1986 accounted for 8.9 million dollars in wholesale value. Related to fisheries are the several aquaculture operations within theMonterey Bay area. Dependent in large part on a clean source of ocean waters,some operations collect organisms directly from the Bay while others growand produce their own supplies through captive breeding. Algae, abalone,otters, salmon, and sea hares are being raised in the various aquacultureventures.Making a more interest use of the area are the commercial ships which regularlytraverse the outer reaches of the area as part of the route from San Francisoto Los Angeles, with infrequent vessel traffic to Moss Landing, Santa Cruz,or Monterey. Although this traffic is not yet a major concern, contingencyplans designed to react to oil spills resulting from tanker accidents arebeing formulated.Oil and gas exploration in the Bay area is being considered. On November16, 1988, the Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service issueda Call for Information and Nomination for Oil and Gas Lease Sale andplusmin;119,an area which overlaps a portion of the proposed Sanctuary study area.Another use of the Bay area is for dredge and waste disposal. A site offMoss Landing is used for discharged dredge spoils. Municipal and industrialwastes are dumped into the waters at various outfalls. Non-point agriculturalrunoff is also entering the Bay.Military uses of the area are rare, but onshore target practice necessitatesprohibiting boats within a designated area offshore of Fort Ord on an occasionalbasis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Existing Protection of Marine Resources</ITAG>Several agencies operate programs to protect significant resources withinthe Monterey Bay area and to provide recreational and interpretive opportunities.California Parks and Recreation and the California Department of Fish andGame manage 15 state beaches, 2 state reserves, 2 state parks, 1 wildlifearea and ecological Reserve, Pacific Grove Marine Life Refuge, Point LobosState Reserve, Carmel Bay Ecological Reserve, and the California Sea OtterGame Refuge. Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve providesresource management and protection to one of the most important estuariesin central California. Los Padres National Forest protects coastal resourceswhere it borders the sea.These programs have placed considerable emphasis on the protection of coastalresources but have not given the same attention to marine resources. Somecritical marine areas, such as the waters around AnandCx.174;6o Nuevo Islandand over the Monterey Submarine Canyon, receive no special attention byresource managers. Other areas, such as the waters of the Big Sur coastline,receive limited protection. A limiting factor that may hamper resourcemanagement is the lack of a mechanisn to establish research prioritiesand coordination, and develop contingency plans for potential accidents.With current resources of existing programs being limited, the coordinationof resource protection and management programs is essential. The MontereyBay Sanctuary could provide an important role in such coordination.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Designation Process</ITAG>The management plan to be prepared for the proposed Sanctuary will specifythe goals and objectives of Sanctuary designation and describe programsfor resource protection, research and interpretation. The various administrativeand regulatory alternatives to Sanctuary management will be analyzed inthe environmental impact statement.Opportunities for public participation in NOAA's development of an environmentalimpact statement and management plan will be provided through the Januaryscoping meetings, solicitation of comments on the draft environmental impactstatement and management plan, and formal public hearings.The January scoping meetings will attempt to identify issues in establishinga Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and generate suggestions for resolvingthem. Topics for discussion will include the following: (1) Boundary alternatives,(2) Management alternatives, (3) Resource protection, (4) Research opportunitiesand (5) Interpretive opportunities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.
