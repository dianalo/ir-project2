These Chinese see President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of``glasnost,'' or greater openness, as an example they would liketheir country's leaders to follow.   China and the Soviet Union share similar histories of autocraticgovernment, state repression and socialist economic stagnation.   In recent years, both countries have launched market-orientedreforms aimed at modernizing their economies and raising livingstandards to meet citizens' growing expectations.   Economic liberalization under senior leader Deng Xiaoping hasbrought relative prosperity to millions of Chinese.   However, Deng has refused to imitate Gorbachev's politicalreforms, which have allowed unprecedented open debate in the SovietUnion over sensitive political issues.   Only on the student-established ``free-speech platforms'' in thestreets of Beijing during the past two weeks have Chinese tastedanything approaching glasnost. There, students and workers alikehave engaged in heated debates over China's political history,economic problems and growing official corruption.   Thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streetssince mid-April and more demonstrations loomed after the governmenttoday turned down a student demand that new independent studentunions be recognized.   The students' demands that the government end officialprivilege, nepotism and profiteering have especially struck a rawnerve among many Chinese who are angered by 30 percent inflactionand blatant displays of ill-gotten wealth.   The workers who joined the students in last week's triumphantmarch through Beijing's streets said the leadership's refusal toenact democratic reforms and allow the press to freely speak outagainst abuse of privilege are partly to blame for the country'seconomic woes.   ``Sure, there's been some improvement, and I do better than mostpeople,'' said taxi driver Zheng Jun. ``But the leadership's rottento the core, and it's incompetent too.   ``There should be a way for the ordinary people to reach thegovernment with their problems,'' he said.   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, in a recent essay, alluded to theSoviet example when he called for ``use of open glasnost-stylemeans to root out corruption.''   The Chinese Communist Party has said political reform, meaning ashrinking of its role in government and business, will take adecade, and that it will be at least 20 to 30 years before nationalelections are possible _ a slow process the students want toaccelerate.   ``The Soviets are ahead of us. At least they have elections,''said another Beijing resident.   ``Maybe when Gorbachev comes to China on May 15 we candemonstrate and get his help,'' said Beijing University studentWang Qiang.   While they have turned to Moscow for support and ideas, thestudents' concepts of democracy and freedom were inherited from anearlier generation of Chinese intellectuals, many of whom studiedat the Sorbonne, Oxford and Harvard and returned to spearheadprotests in their homeland.   Chinese who studied in the West played key roles in the May 4,1919 student pro-democracy movement and in the Communist revolution.   The t students, who want fundamental reform of China'stightly controlled political system and an end to widespreadcorruption, se Western democracies as models frotests,freedom of speech and the press, and democracy _ views shared bymany Chinese.   Numerous students said American student protests in the 1960sagainst the Vietnam War inspired them to take to te streets,despite the fact thamerica at that time was China's No. 1 enemy.   ``Don't American students protest, too?'' they asked repeatedl   Fewexpect concrete support for their efforts from abroad, butthey did welcome news of a U.S. State Departmtatement May 26that said: ``The United States believes in and supports the rightof peaceful ly, including peaceful protest and the freedom onot only inChina but around the world.''   The students repeatedly ask journalists to report the news ofthts accurately ``to let the world know what is happeningin China,'' one student said, ``and so other countries can supportus.''   ``We want support from around the world,said another.</TEXT></DOC>
