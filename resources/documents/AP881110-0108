The 26-page speech by President Philipp Jenninger made somelisteners cry but drew angry criticism from other members ofparliament, who said Jenniger recounted Nazi atrocities in aninappropriately cool and dispassionate manner.   ``He marched through history with the intellect of combatboots,'' said Wolfgang Lueder, a parliament member of the FreeDemocratic Party.   The controversy marred a session marking the 50th anniversary ofKristallnacht, the first night of organized Nazi terror against theJews.      The ceremony featured an emotional appearance by Ida Ehre, an88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor who read from PaulCelan's poem ``Todesfuge.''      ``Death is a master from Germany, his eye is blue,'' Ms. Ehre, awell-known actress and director in Hamburg, read from the famouswork. ``He strikes thee with leaden bullets, he strikes theeexactly.''   Ms. Ehre, dressed in black with a white blouse, spoke beforeparliament and invited guests, including West German Jewish leaderHeinz Galinski.   During the Third Reich, the Nazis barred the Jewish actress fromworking and eventually sent her to a concentration camp for severalyears.   Later during today's session, Ms. Ehre put her hands on herforehead and began crying as Jenninger began reading an eyewitnessaccount of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942.   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' the56-year-old Jenninger read. ``Some of those shot were still moving,some lifted their arms and turned their heads, to show they werestill alive.''   As he read, some of the lawmakers in the audience appeared on theverge of tears, and federal President Richard von Weizsaecker at onepoint buried his head in his hand.   But some opposition lawmakers said other portions of Jenniger'slacked a feeling of atonement for what happened to the Jews duringthe Holocaust, and demanded he resign as a parliament president.   Social Democratic and Greens party members left the hall toprotest the speech, which was part of the hour-long servicetelevised live nationwide.   ``I don't agree with this speech, but I will express my criticismwithin the party,'' said Johannes Gerster, a member of Jenninger'sown Christian Democratic Party.   Lueder said Jenninger ``spoke of Germans and foreign Jews insteadof Jewish Germans.'' Lueder criticized Jenninger for usingexpressions such as ``Arianization of property,'' without sufficientexplanation of its ruthless meaning during the Third Reich. He alsocriticized Jenninger for not using the expression, ``German Jews,''when talking about the victims of the Nazi terror.   Social Democrat and Greens members criticized Jenninger forpresenting the speech ``in a dry emotionless way,'' and for ``notclearly expressing repulsion at what the Nazis did.''   West Germany, Austria and communist East Germany have heldobservances this week as a reminder of the death and destructionbegun during Kristallnacht and carried on throughout the Holocaust.   On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi thugs ransacked 7,500Jewish businesses, destroyed thousands of Jewish homes and sent30,000 Jews to concentration camps. Ninety-one Jews were killed and267 synagogues destroyed.   The rampage coordinated by Adolf Hitler's henchmen left citystreets littered with glass _ hence the name Kristallnacht, or Nightof Broken Glass.   Historians say Kristallnacht was the start of the Nazis' campaignto wipe out European Jews, a campaign that eventually claimed 6million Jewish lives.   There are about 32,000 Jews in West Germany. The number ofpracticing Jews in East Germany is estimated at 450-600, with nopermanent rabbi.</TEXT></DOC>
