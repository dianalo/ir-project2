In the early hours today, people were still coming to the maingate of Anfield Road stadium, converging on a 100-foot expanse ofsteel fence and gate covered with clusters of flowers, clubbanners, scarves and hats.   ``They only wanted to see their heroes ... '' began one longepitaph taped to the fence honoring Liverpool fans who died in ahuman crush Saturday at Hillsborough stadium 65 miles away inSheffield.   At the gate, a memorial to legendary manager Bill Shanklyadorned with the motto ``You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a man andwoman stood locked together in love and grief, barely moving formore than half an hour while the woman's sobbing never ceased.   Many others could be heard crying but few spoke.   ``We're all so close. Everyone knows someone who died,'' saidJason Travers, 20, who had come to put up a card for a 16-year-oldfriend who died in Sheffield.   ``So sad, so sad,'' a strapping young man said brokenly as hewalked along the barrier. Another clenched a fist and cried out``Why?''   With the adjoining street closed to traffic, sometimes the onlysound was people crying or the footfalls of people coming and going.   At the Metropolitan Cathedral, which was filled to overflowingfor an ecumenical requiem Mass, the red banner of LiverpoolFootball Club stood near the altar.   At the Anglican Cathedral, the Bell of Great George tolled 94times. Customarily rung for the death of a monarch, the bell's deeptone had last been heard on May 29, 1985, ringing for the 39 mostlyItalian fans killed in a riot involving Liverpool fans at a Belgianstadium.   Liverpool's match on Wednesday against West Ham United has beencanceled. ``It is our view that all football matches involving ourclub should be suspended for the time being,'' club chairman JohnSmith said Sunday.   But the Anfield stadium was open during the day and fans came toplace flowers on the ``Kop,'' the terrace behind one of the goalswhere thousands of fiercely loyal fans congregate.   It was on a similar but smaller terrace at Sheffield that the 94fans died. ``You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a song known to every fanon the Kop, was repeated on many of the messages left at the gate.   Among the messages was one from a survivor, ``To those whocarried me from the goalmouth yesterday, you never knew me but I'llnever forget you.''   Other expressions of sympathy were left by fans of Liverpool'sother big-league football club, Everton. In many families, childrengrow up with split loyalties to the red and white of Liverpool andthe blue and white of Everton.   Liverpool is by far the more successful club _ four timesEuropean champion and a record 17 times English League winner _ butthe rivalry with Everton is respectful and friendly.   Everton qualified Saturday for the final of the premier EnglishF.A. (Football Association) Cup, its third final in six years.Soccer authorities will decide this week if and when to replayLiverpool's semifinal game.</TEXT></DOC>
