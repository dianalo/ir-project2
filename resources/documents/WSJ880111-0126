The company, 47%-owned by BCE Inc., Montreal, also estimated its 1987 per-share net income at about 95 Canadian cents (73 cents), compared with net income of 60.6 million dollars ($47.1 million), or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating profit in 1986 was 175.1 million dollars, before charges of 114.5 million dollars.    The planned dividend reduction reflects &quot;the change in our business mix resulting from the recent acquisition of Encor Energy Corp.,&quot; an oil and gas producer, said Gerald Maier, TransCanada's president. He added that as a result of the acquisition, the company's oil and gas assets are now about equal to its pipeline assets.    Mr. Maier said prices for oil and natural gas and the initial impact of the Encor purchase &quot;may put some downward pressure&quot; on TransCanada's 1988 net income. But he added that some offsetting positive signs include the &quot;indication of some resolve by OPEC to control oil production,&quot; and the recent strengthening of natural gas spot prices in the U.S.    TransCanada said it intends to cut its quarterly dividend to 17 cents a share from from 28 cents. It said the change won't affect the planned payment of 28 cents a share Jan. 29 to stock of record Dec. 31.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, TransCanada shares fell $1 to close at $11. </TEXT></DOC>
