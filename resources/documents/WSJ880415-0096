He pledged to continue backing the Afghan resistance in its efforts to topple the Moscow-backed Kabul regime despite the likelihood of Soviet-inspired retaliation against Pakistan.    Sounding defiant and confident in a three-hour lunch session with reporters, the Pakistani president for the first time blamed saboteurs for an ammunition-dump explosion in Islamabad Sunday that left at least 93 dead and 1,100 injured. Many of the weapons lost in the explosion had recently arrived on U.S. transport planes and were intended to give a shot in the arm to the resistance. President Zia also made clear that although the first of 115,000 Soviet troops would start leaving Afghanistan on May 15, the test of wills over the future of Afghanistan would continue.    His statement was the clearest signal yet that Pakistan, the critical conduit for arms to the resistance, intends to remain a major player despite a portion of the Geneva accord that obliges it not to support &quot;directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist activities&quot; in Afghanistan.    That portion contradicts a separate agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union under which the two superpowers have the right to continue arming the warring Afghan parties. President Zia's statements are likely to heighten tensions between Moscow and Islamabad despite the signing of the accords.    &quot;Perhaps Pakistan will have to pay a little more price until the mujahedeen {Moslem resistance} achieve their aims in Afghanistan,&quot; he said. &quot;If worse comes to worse, then Pakistan will face the music and will pay the price,&quot; which he said would be &quot;arm-twisting, border-bombing and other things.&quot;    Although President Zia didn't mention the Soviets or the Soviet-controlled Afghan government by name in connection with the Sunday explosion, he said it was &quot;my own personal assessment that it couldn't be anything but a very effective act of sabotage.&quot; He declined to give details, pending a government inquiry, but said the saboteurs wanted to embarrass the Pakistani military and create tensions between it and the people.    President Zia was clearly buoyed by the Geneva signing, though he said it doesn't satisfy Pakistan's two remaining goals of repatriating three million Afghan refugees and bringing about a non-aligned, self-determining Afghanistan.    Terming the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan a &quot;miracle of the 20th century,&quot; he said, &quot;I openly confess that I was one of those who said it was impossible.&quot; He said the fall of the Najibullah government in Kabul is inevitable and predicted the emergence of a Sunni Islamic regime.    He shrugged off comments that Pakistan would need to violate the Geneva agreement in order to back the resistance. &quot;We are going by both what is in the accords and what is not in the accords,&quot; he said, smiling. He quoted U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz as saying it was up to the lawyers to find out how that could be done. In Geneva, Mr. Shultz pledged continued U.S. supplies to the Moslem guerrillas, but a U.S. statement added: &quot;Should the Soviet Union exercise restraint in providing military assistance to parties in Afghanistan, the U.S. similarly will exercise restraint.&quot;    Mr. Zia made clear that Pakistan would allow the three million Afghan refugees to remain inside its borders until they decided of their own free will to go home.    &quot;They {the resistance} haven't got much confidence in the accords and I can understand their point of view,&quot; he said. &quot;I foresee trouble in Afghanistan.&quot;    Yet he defended Pakistan's decision to sign the flawed agreements, which allow the fighting to continue and don't define what sort of future government will rule Afghanistan. He said the accords were the only way to gain the Soviet withdrawal.    Pakistan had sought arrangements in the accord for an interim regime to reduce the chance of civil war. It had also sought a clause requiring Washington and Moscow to cease military deliveries to the warring factions. Moscow refused, insisting it couldn't because of treaties with Kabul.    President Zia scoffed at suggestions that deep divisions among the seven Afghan guerrilla groups might prevent them from toppling the Kabul regime. Many Western experts say the Soviet troop withdrawal will set off a bloody competition for power among moderate and fundamentalist Islamic resistance groups.    Mr. Zia said that despite their differences, the resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime. &quot;Look at the Palestinians, they have been fighting for their rights for 40 years,&quot; he said. &quot;They haven't achieved what seven divided Afghan parties have achieved in eight years.&quot; If the resistance feuds over power once the Kabul regime falls, he said, &quot;I couldn't care less.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
