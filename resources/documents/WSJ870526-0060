Sandamp;P, which rates the $13.3 million issue at double-C, projected that the authority will be able to pay about $1.5 million on the due date next Monday. The rating concern said this would still leave the authority $485,000 short of the total obligation on that date.    James Hughes Jr., executive director of the authority, said the authority is only a financial conduit for the bonds, which are industrial revenue bonds. As a result, he said, the bonds and the payments &quot;aren't a financial responsibility of the authority.&quot;    The bonds are the responsibility of Cogeneration Development Corp., a New York-based power company, according to the development authority. The bond issue raised funds for a project by Cogeneration to provide steam to New Jersey state facilities and power to Newark, N.J.-based Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co., a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.    Sandamp;P said the shortage of funds is due to a reduction in sales to the state and to the electric and gas utility. Default could be averted, it said, if equity participants provide short-term and long-term financial assistance.    Officials at Cogeneration weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
