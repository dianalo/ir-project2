The NEA was choosing a new president today to take over whenFutrell steps down at the end of the summer after six years at thehelm of the 2-million-member union.   Running to succeed Futrell were union vice president Keith Geigerof Michigan and executive committee member John Wilson of NorthCarolina.   ``I am still Mary the teacher,'' the departing NEA president told8,400 delegates Sunday at the annual NEA Representative Assembly.``Remember me as ... someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves ofher soul.''   Don't rain on the parade of educational reform _ lead it, sheurged in her final speech.   ``We must embrace change and reject reaction,'' she said. ``Wemust continue to expand politically and professionally as we haveover the last 20 years, especially the last five years ... We mustpush hard, we must take risks, we must never let up.''   As the nation's largest union and one of its most politicallyactive, the NEA has considerable clout both in Washington and at thegrassroots level.   Of the two candidates, Geiger was generally considered moremoderate and likely to continue on the course set by Futrell, whileWilson promised passionate leadership with no bows to public opinion.   Geiger, in accepting his nomination Sunday, described himself asan experienced collective bargainer who would be ``tough butflexible'' as president.   ``You deserve a president who will confront issues squarely, butwill never confuse confrontation with results,'' Geiger told thedelegates. ``Your next president must know when to stand firm andwhen to bend, how to recognize necessary and legitimate reform andhow to recognize political posturing.''   Wilson vowed to teach politicians and corporate leaders that ``wedeserve good pay for the work we do and we shouldn't have to jumpthrough a lot of hoops to get it.''   He attacked merit pay as wrong and divisive and pledged to ``doeverything in my power to defeat it.'' He also attacked``educational bureaucrats who stand in our path'' to reform bypiling on paperwork and cutting back budgets.   Both candidates praised Futrell and echoed her theme of teacherempowerment. Geiger told the delegates that ``you must play the keyroles in deciding how your schools are run,'' while Wilson said he``will not rest until the classrooms of the future are shaped bythose who work in them.''   In a speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause andstanding ovations, Futrell spoke on broad issues ranging from guncontrol to the global economy to subjects specifically affectingchildren and education.   She said the NEA must stand firm in its opposition to vouchers,tuition tax credits and half-baked suggestions from ``the elitists,the politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced.''   But Futrell exhorted the union, once labeled ``the status quoincarnate'' by former Education Secretary William Bennett, to be aconstructive force in school reform.   Futrell said system-wide restructuring must be conceived andexecuted by educators and that NEA should take the lead.   She also reiterated NEA calls for full funding of federaleducation, health and nutrition programs for disadvantaged children.She scolded President Bush for failing to accept an invitation tospeak to the group, whose membership is about one-third Republican.</TEXT></DOC>
