Dang; edited by StevenWebsterandM;To understand the differences among the new spreadsheets that promisethree-dimensional features, it is helpful to categorize spreadsheet programsinto four general classes.andP;  The products PC Week tested fall into the lasttwo categories.andM;Such traditional two-dimensional spreadsheets as Lotus' 1-2-3 2.01 andBorland International Inc.'s Quattro 1.0 offer a large grid of cells that canreference other cells so that a change in one part of the sheet is almostinstantly reflected elsewhere.andP;  The disadvantage is that it can be difficultto keep track of the changes.andM;The next generation of programs is linked spreadsheets.andP;  With a specialsyntax, users can create links between multiple sheets, even those withdissimilar structures, either in memory or in disk files.andP;  Linking syntax canbe very powerful and flexible, as demonstrated in products such as Borland'sQuattro Pro or Microsoft Corp.'s PC Excel.andP;  The difficulties with this typeof spreadsheet often center around the referential integrity of the datalocated in the other files.andP;  It is possible for the data in the referencedfile to change and not be reflected in the current model.andM;Next to arrive were true three-dimensional spreadsheets, such as Lotus' 1-2-33.0 and Computer Associates' SuperCalc 5.andP;  With additional &quot;pages&quot; locatedalong a third axis, these products are useful for consolidating data filesthat have the same structure.andP;  The cube model is well-suited for certaintasks, such as budget consolidation and analysis of scientific data.andP;  Seeingspatial relationships with a cube is much harder than with a 2-D sheet,however, and the potential for error is commensurately higher.andM;Finally, so-called relational spreadsheets, such as Sinper's TM/1 and theupcoming VP-Planner 3D from Paperback Software, store data in a separatedatabase and use the spreadsheet metaphor to display the data and provide aplace for numerical analysis.andP;  A plus for this model is that data can bereferred to by name instead of location.andP;  Thus, &quot;A:J17&quot; might be more easilyreferred to as &quot;SALES.TAX.1988.&quot; Relational spreadsheets can generallymanipulate data in more than three dimensions since the data is not spatiallyconstrained by a three-dimensional structure.andM;-- Dale Lewallen</TEXT></DOC>
