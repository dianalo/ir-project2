A spokesman, citing continued shrinkage in the world-wide shipbuilding industry and the effects of the yen's appreciation, noted the concern also didn't pay a dividend in the same six-month reporting period a year earlier.    The last time Hitachi Zosen made a dividend payment was in the full-year period ended March 1985.    The company is reeling from the impact of a sharp drop in revenue from ship repair and shipbuilding. </TEXT></DOC>
