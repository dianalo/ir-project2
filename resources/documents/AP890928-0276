One eleventh-hour proposal by Iran to revamp existing quotas,for example, was viewed by many as having sufficient merit towarrant further discussion at the upcoming meeting, scheduled forNov. 25 in Vienna.   ``It opened a possible avenue for solving the quota problem,''said OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister.   Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant based in Vienna, calledthe plan a first step.   ``They have a much better chance of getting somewhere inNovember,'' he said.   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries ended five days of sometimes acrimoniousdiscussions Wednesday by agreeing to increase their supply ceilinga modest amount in the fourth quarter.   In the absence of a consensus on how to carve up OPEC'sproduction share to please all the countries, a plan was announcedto simply bump up the supply ceiling from 19.5 million barrels aday to 20.5 million barrels in the October-December period.   Analysts said the decision, aimed at lifting prices of OPECcrude about a dollar to their target of $18 a barrel, simplylegitimized part of the 22.5 million barrels a day the cartel isbelieved to be producing already. It also more accurately reflectsthe rising world demand for OPEC oil.   However, the meeting was sufficiently divisive that a finalstatement, normally given at the close of OPEC meetings, was notissued.   ``They didn't release a communique because not all of theministers would sign one,'' said Rick Donovan, head of globalenergy for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   More importantly, the ministers held serious discussions aboutways to divvy up their oil production shares to everyone'ssatisfaction, according to some analysts.   ``It was a surprise the ministers actually got into a lot ofissues they did,'' said Stanislaw.   Iran unveiled its proposal on Tuesday, four days after themeeting began and ministers extended their stay in Geneva toexamine it. The plan would raise OPEC's output cap to 21.5 millionbarrels a day to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates for bigger production shares.   The two countries have been openly ignoring their assignedquotas in an effort to press their demands for a redistribution oftheir individual supply quotas. Kuwait's quota is 1.09 millionbarrels and the U.A.E.'s is 1.04 million but both are believed tobe producing about twice their allotment.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, speaking to reportersthrough a translator, said his plan ``would be a basis to solve theproblems of OPEC _ hopefully for good.''   ``Everyone was taken with it,'' said John Lichtblau of thePetroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ``There's a lotof momentum behind it.''   Aqazadeh said his plan was designed to meet the dual requests ofbig producers in the Persian Gulf to produce more and those ofsmaller ones for higher prices.   ``The large producing countries ... could guarantee some sort ofprice for the others,'' he said.   In exchange, the smaller producers, who complain thatoverproduction hurts prices, would give up some of their outputshares to the bigger ones.   Specifically, the plan called for a marked increase in theproduction slices of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Gabon andEcuador. The shares of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Libya would stay thesame.   Iran and Iraq would lose a bit, and Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesiaand Venezuela would lose more.   Libya opposed the plan because it wants the same share as Kuwait.   Analysts predict oil prices will hold relatively steady orweaken slightly in the next few months. Gasoline prices at the pumpcould slip, depending on the cartel's production pattern, but thenew ceiling is not likely to affect actual output, they said.   The November meeting is designed to plot production strategy for1990.   ``Our hope is that in the meantime nobody does anything silly toupset the good atmosphere which we have now,'' said Lukman.   If tempers don't flare, he said, ``we'll be in a good mood tofinalize it.''</TEXT></DOC>
