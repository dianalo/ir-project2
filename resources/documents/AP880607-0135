Four U.S. Senate races also were on the ballots as seven statesheld primaries, and Montana had a wide-open race for governor,highlighted by former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge's comeback bid.   The liveliest Senate primary was in New Mexico, where pollsshowed state Sen. Bill Valentine leading three fellow Republicansfor the nomination to oppose first-term Democratic Sen. JeffBingaman.   Three other Senate primaries were all Democratic skirmishesleading to the main event in November. First-term Sen. FrankLautenberg of New Jersey had two little-known opponents as he soughtto defend his seat against Republican Peter Dawkins; Montana Sen.John Melcher had one challenger in his bid for a third term againstRepublican Conrad Burns, and California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy wasfavored over three rivals to win a chance to face Republican Sen.Pete Wilson.   In Newark's heavily Democratic 10th district, where Rep. PeterRodino was retiring after 40 years, black City Councilmen DonaldPayne and Ralph Grant competed in the Democratic primary. The winnerwas expected to defeat the GOP nominee, political newcomer MichaelWebb, who also is black.   In Montana, Judge was one of six Democrats who entered the racefor governor after Democrat Ted Schwinden decided not to seek athird term. Former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. CalWinslow were the only Republican candidates left after the earlyfavorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a planecrash in April.   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor was seeking a full four-yearterm and needed a majority in the non-partisan primary to avoid arunoff in the nation's seventh-largest city.   Californians confronted their usual slew of ballot measures,including proposals to ease state spending limits, curb campaignspending, slow growth and declare AIDS a communicable disease,subjecting victims to potential quarantine.   In Sacramento County, a measure seeking closure of the RanchoSeco nuclear power plant could mark the first time in history thatvoters have directly ordered the shutdown of such a facility.   And in San Bernardino County, geographically the nation'slargest, voters were asked to carve away the eastern, desert portionto create a new jurisdiction called Mojave County.   Here are highlights of voting in the other states:   ALABAMA _ Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a son-in-law of former Gov.George C. Wallace, was running for the Democratic nomination tostate Supreme Court on a slate supported by trial lawyers andopposed by big business and insurance companies.   IOWA _ Sixteen supporters of extremist Lyndon LaRouche wererunning in Democratic primaries, five for congressional nominationsand the rest in state legislative districts.   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and therewere only 26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats.</TEXT><TEXT>   In the Senate races, the national GOP has hopes of unseating bothBingaman and Lautenberg. New Mexico Republicans have portrayedBingaman as too liberal for a state that has long supported heavydefense spending. In New Jersey, Dawkins, a Heisman trophy winner,Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War hero, moved to the Garden State toenter the race and based his early campaigning mainly on hisimpressive resume.   Both states have Republican governors who will campaign for theGOP Senate candidates.   California's Wilson has been far ahead of McCarthy infund-raising and the polls. His biggest obstacle appears to be ajinx on his Senate seat which has prevented any occupant fromwinning re-election in more than 30 years.   Burns, the Republican nominee in Montana, is a commissioner inYellowstone County who has yet to achieve much statewiderecognition. A Minnesota man withdrew from the GOP race too late forhis name to be taken off the ballot.   Schwinden's retirement after two terms in Montana left thegovernorship without a Democratic incumbent on the ballot for thefirst time in 20 years. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the primaryin 1980.   Rodino, the House Judiciary chairman who led the impeachmenthearings against former President Nixon, is stepping down amidgrowing sentiment that his predominantly black district should berepresented by a black. He made no endorsement in the primary.   The AIDS measure, sponsored by LaRouche supporters, was opposedby the California Medical Association and the leadership of bothmajor parties. It was almost identical to a plan defeated by a 2-1margin in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
