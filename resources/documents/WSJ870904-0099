NormanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. International Trade Commission, ruling that imports of forged steel crankshafts from West Germany and Britain are injuring a domestic industry, cleared the way for anti-dumping duties on the imports.    The decisions followed earlier rulings by the Commerce Department that the imports are being dumped in the U.S. -- that is, sold here at prices below the cost of production or the prices in the home market. The imports totaled about $35 million last year.    The Commerce Department and the ITC will decide later this year whether anti-dumping duties may also be required on forged steel crankshafts from Japan and Brazil, ITC officials said. The imports from Japan last year amounted to about $20 million, while imports from Brazil totaled about $15 million.    In all of these trade cases, ITC officials said the products involved are crankshafts used in diesel trucks, farm machinery and other heavy-duty vehicles.    The ITC decision in the West German case primarily involves imports supplied by Thyssen AG. Earlier, the Commerce Department concluded that anti-dumping duties of about 2% should be assessed on those imports. The duties represent the extent to which the imports are dumped in the U.S. For the imports from Britain, the Commerce Department decided earlier that the anti-dumping duties should be about 24.5%.    ITC officials said the imports from Britain totaled less than $10 million in 1986, while West Germany was a substantially larger supplier.    In another action, the ITC concluded that anti-dumping duties also should be imposed on imports of heat-insulating silica filament fabric from Japan. These imports have amounted to only a few million dollars a year, but the Commerce Department has determined that high anti-dumping duties, amounting to 194%, will be required on the imports. </TEXT></DOC>
