James R. Thompson,considered a possible vice presidential pick for George Bush, saidWednesday that he doesn't expect such an offer and doesn't knowwhat he'd say if he got it.   But Thompson said that his moderate politics wouldn't disqualifyhim from a spot on the GOP ticket.   ``I never thought moderation was a vice,'' Thompson said in aninterview during a quick visit to Atlanta to take part in a GOP``truth squad'' session giving the Republican perspective on theDemocratic National Convention.   ``I'm too moderate for some people, but I've never been told I'mtoo moderate for George Bush,'' Thompson said. ``George Bush and Iagree on a lot of things.''   He also said he thinks the country's voters average out to bemoderate, so two moderates on a ticket would be electable.   When he was first elected in 1976 and again in 1978, theRepublican Thompson was endorsed by Jesse Jackson, the ChicagoDemocrat who now is part of what Thompson branded a ``troika''emerging as the 1988 Democratic ticket. He said that troikaincludes presidential candidate Michael Dukakis; Texas Sen. LloydBentsen, Dukakis' vice-presidential choice, and Jackson.   ``A lot of Democrats have endorsed me and voted for me,'' hesaid. Bob Gibson, the Illinois State AFL-CIO president and adelegate to this week's Democratic convention, has endorsedThompson in the last two of his four elections.   A Democratic legislature blocked Thompson's bid for a 40 percentincome tax increase in Illinois. He said his fight for the taxhike, which he termed ``modest,'' does not clash with Bush'santi-tax talk.   ``I don't think there's any discrepancy between supporting apresidential candidate who says he doesn't want to raise taxes andpushing a modest tax increase in your own state,'' Thompson said.He said Bush believes in limiting federal taxes to give states more``running room'' to fill their own financial needs.   The four-term Illinois governor, who has held the post since1977, has the longest tenure in the job in state history.   Thompson, 52, said he does not expect Bush to ask him to runbecause of the field of strong GOP candidates available, includingKansas Sen. Robert Dole, former Transportation Secretary ElizabethDole, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp.   He said capability to be president, shared philosophy andability to carry out a strong campaign are should be key factors inBush's choice. Geography should be part of it, ``but it should bethe least part,'' he said.   ``I don't really know what the job entails,'' he added. ``Thepopular wisdom is that you're the No. 2 man,'' he said. But in thereal world, ``The president's staff is the No. 2 man. The cabinetis the No. 3 man, and then the Congress is No. 4 man. ... MaybeGeorge Bush would rank his vice president higher than Dukakiswould. I don't know.''   He said Bush is probably higher up the ladder ``on some issues''in the Reagan administration.   Thompson said he would have to weigh a change in lifestyle thata vice presidency would bring to him and his family, including wifeJayne and 9-year-old daughter Samantha.   ``It would be in a different city, and being vice presidentmeans you would be away probably more than as governor,'' saidThompson, who lives with his family in a Chicago home and also hasliving quarters in the governor's mansion in Springfield. ``Thatwould weigh heavily on me, I think.''</TEXT></DOC>
