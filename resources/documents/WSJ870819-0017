In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Occidental disclosed that a former subsidiary of MidCon is attempting to settle for a total of $190 million two breach-of-contract lawsuits in Louisiana. As previously reported, another MidCon unit already faces a $412 million judgment in a separate breach-of-contract and antitrust lawsuit in Wyoming.    In one of the Louisiana suits, United Gas Pipe Line Co., a former Midcon subsidiary, has agreed to pay $75 million to the city of New Orleans, New Orleans Public Service Inc. and a class of New Orleans Public Service ratepayers to settle a breach-of-contract complaint. The settlement was approved yesterday by a U.S. District Court judge in New Orleans, a New Orleans Public Service spokesman said.    United Gas Pipe Line also has agreed in principle to settle a similar breach-of-contract suit brought by Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co. Both complaints, filed in 1974, charge that United curtailed deliveries of gas for periods in late 1970 to early 1982, forcing the utilities to switch to other, more-expensive sources of natural gas.    The tentative agreement requires the approval of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. It also would settle a related pricing suit brought a few years later by Louisiana Power andamp; Light.    On June 30, MidCon sold United Gas Pipe Line and a marketing affiliate to LaSalle Energy Corp., Dallas, for $322 million in cash and $138 million in notes. MidCon agreed to assume any liability arising from the pending cases.    In the filing, Occidental said it has &quot;restricted&quot; $250 million in cash related to a gas-transmission contract dispute in litigation. Last month, the company set aside an additional $100 million in connection with a separate gas-transmission dispute, but didn't specify which lawsuits were involved.    The funds, which are carried as assets on the company's balance sheet, are held in accounts overseen by a trustee. An Occidental spokesman said the funds are partial security for appeals in several actions, but declined to specify which cases were involved.    As previously reported, Coastal Corp. won an initial $724 million judgment against another MidCon subsidiary in November 1986, after a jury found that the MidCon unit had broken a natural-gas purchase agreement. The jury also found that the unit, Natural Gas Pipeline Co., had attempted to form a market monopoly in parts of the West and Midwest.    A federal judge in Wyoming upheld the jury verdict in June, but reduced the award to $412 million. Occidental has appealed the decision, the spokesman said.    The MidCon cases aren't the first legal entanglements that Occidental has assumed through acquisitions. Occidental also is a target of lawsuits filed in connection with landfills at Love Canal in New York through its Occidental Chemical Corp. unit.    Occidental said in the SEC filing that in the past several months it has been served with additional related complaints that stem from Occidental's acquisition of Hooker Chemicals andamp; Plastics Corp. in 1968.    Warren Shimmerlik, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research andamp; Economics, noted that the suits involve different problems in different industries. &quot;In the Love Canal case, it was kind of a ticking time bomb that no one really expected when Oxy got in,&quot; he said. &quot;But almost all pipeline companies have a myriad of legal problems, like MidCon.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
