Pete Wilson signed into law late Tuesday, hassomething for everyone -- to hate.   The governor and the Legislature ended months of wranglingover how to close a record $14.3 billion spending gap with aprescription that will hit welfare mothers, college studentsand the rich, to name a few.</LP><TEXT>   In all, the spending program mandates $5.1 billion inprogram cuts and a basket of tax increases totaling $7.4billion that goes some distance in suggesting that the taxrevolt that the state started in the 1970s is at least in apartial retreat.   &quot;It's an extremely punitive budget,&quot; says EthelLong-Scott, executive director of Women's Economic AgendaProject of Oakland. &quot;It's essentially `the poor be damned.'&quot;   The budget could also have national politicalrepercussions for Mr. Wilson, a moderate Republican, who wasroundly criticized by conservatives in the state for accedingto the large tax increase instead of pushing harder forspending cuts.   The last piece of the budget puzzle was resolved when theLegislature agreed to boost income taxes for the state'swealthiest residents to 10% from 9.3% for individuals makingmore than $100,000 and for couples making more than $200,000.For individuals making more than $200,000 and for couplesmaking $400,000, the rate is boosted to 11%. The increaseaffects 1.5% of the state's population but is expected togenerate $1.2 billion in new taxes.   In exchange for supporting the increase, conservativesmanaged to elicit new limitations in how the state's workercompensation system operates, although the reforms werelargely symbolic and far less than business interests wereseeking.   The main change in the compensation system is that workerswill be barred from filing disability claims based onpsychological stress within six months of being hired. Stressclaims, while still a relatively small share of total claimsfiled, have grown rapidly in recent years, and have been apolitical lightening rod in the debate over the sprawlingsystem. Critics have contended that an unusually large numberof claims filed within the six months of employment arefraudulent.   Much of the tax increase will be in the form of apermanent 0.75 percentage point increase in the state salestax, and an additional 0.50 percentage point temporaryincrease. There are also new taxes on jet fuel and bottledwater, newspapers and candy, and luxury automobiles. In all,$2.9 billion of the new tax increases are permanent, and $2.1billion are temporary.   For business, there is a two-year suspension of operatingtax-loss carry-forwards, which may in fact turn out to be a&quot;major net benefit&quot; to business, said Fred Main, vicepresident of the California Chamber of Commerce. The use oftax loss carry-forwards was set to expire on Dec. 31 anyway,he notes, and the new plan calls for the benefit to bereinstated for five years. He called the budget &quot;about asgood a job as could be done.&quot;   Aside from the tax and spending changes, the budget wasbalanced by shifting $2.1 billion in health and mental healthprograms to local governments. Accounting changes and certainother transfers accounted for an additional $2 billion.   Program cuts include a 4.4% cut in welfare grants -- halfof what Gov. Wilson had requested -- that will save $87million, and a reduction of $13 million in a homelessassistance program. California welfare benefits have beenamong the highest in the nation in recent years, thanks toautomatic cost-of-living allowances. But the latest budgetsuspends the COLA for five years.   Students will be hit by cuts of $1.2 billion, which willmean teacher layoffs, program cuts, and larger classes.California already has the worst student-teacher ratio in thenation. Last year, the state spent $4,826 per pupil, ranking28th in the nation. New York, which ranked first, spent$8,680 per pupil.   &quot;It's going to be rough for schools,&quot; says Superintendentof Public Instruction Bill Honig. &quot;The good news is it couldhave been a lot worse.&quot;   College students will be hit with tuition increases thatwill save the state $96 million, and universities will seecuts of about $200 million.   The budget also assumes a major reduction in livingstandards for the state's roughly 276,000 public employees,who are being asked to take a 5% reduction in pay. Finaldetails haven't been worked out yet. The governor, trying toset the tone for ongoing negotiations, is taking a 5% cut.   To some, the growing tax bite couldn't have come at aworse time.   Gov. Wilson &quot;has signed tax increases which have earnedhim the disgust of every grocer and retailer and consumer inthe state,&quot; said Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock, whosees a &quot;growing exodus by business and industry out ofCalifornia.&quot;   Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, also a Republican, called thebudget a defeat for Gov. Wilson. &quot;There's very little reform,but the taxes are real. This is the biggest tax increaseever, in any state. The tax increase is bigger than theentire budget of 24 states.&quot;   A spokesman for Gov. Wilson said the tax increasesincluded in the latest budget are the largest ever for thestate in dollar terms, but not as a percentage of the totalbudget. That distinction is held by a previous Governor --Ronald Reagan -- in the 1960s.</TEXT></DOC>
