For example, Mr. Bovard would have us believe that thebuild-American provisions of cabotage laws are singularlyresponsible for such disparate circumstances as: the criminalsale of maritime jobs; underutilization of the Panama Canal;exorbitant union salaries; shortages of home heating oil, andthe corrupt Congress, which he alleges. Fortunately, theJones Act is spared the blame for world hunger and the drugepidemic.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bovard dismisses the cabotage laws' role in nationaldefense -- the main purpose for which it was enacted. Allmaritime nations have such laws. In the Persian Gulf War, wesaw a compelling example of cabotage laws' value. In a moreprotracted fight, putting trained people on merchant vesselswill always be a major hurdle; the barge and towing industrycan provide this rich reserve of trained seamen. There aremore onboard jobs in our industry than in any other maritimesector. Without cabotage, there would be little or no readyreserve.   Mr. Bovard ignores the fact that the Jones Act encouragesfierce competition on the U.S.'s waterways. In the tug andbarge industry, scores of towing companies operating on theinland rivers and along the coasts of the U.S. vie with oneanother for cargoes. Without the Jones Act, that competitionwould disappear.   And there is a new and powerful argument for cabotage thatMr. Bovard overlooks: preserving and protecting theenvironment. Foreign crews, manning vessels built below U.S.standards, would have only scant knowledge, if any, ofcomplex U.S. and state environmental laws and regulations.The risk of foreign-owned, foreign-crewed vessels operatingin U.S. waters beyond the reach of U.S. laws is a chanceAmericans are unwilling to take.   Joseph A. Farrell   President   American Waterways Operators   Arlington, Va.   ---   In order to introduce some balance into Mr. Bovard'soutraged cry for repeal of the Jones Act, I would like to setforth briefly the current situation as seen by someone whohas been in the U.S. marine industry for 43 years.   With regard to U.S. construction costs vs. foreign, thegap is shrinking because of higher wages paid to shipyardworkers in Europe and the Far East. This is a matter offinancial indifference to vessel operators as long as we knowwhat the ground rules are. The uncertainty regarding whetherU.S.-flag vessels can be built in foreign yards is preciselywhy U.S. operators are afraid to build speculative tonnage inU.S. yards.   Mr. Bovard ignores the manning scale requirements, whichare the source of U.S.-flag self-propelled vessels' greatestinefficiency. Were it not for U.S. government-imposed manningscales, we would be able to use the same technology used byforeign-flag vessels to operate safer vessels with fewerpersonnel at substantially lower rates.
