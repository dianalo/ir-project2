But analysts remained steadfast in their predictions that thefractured cartel could do little to forestall continued priceerosion through the summer.   ``They just seem to have thrown in the towel,'' said PaulMcDonald, a London-based oil consultant and an expert on theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Prices have dropped sharply over the past month in response tosurplus supplies and a perception among traders that OPEC iscrumbling.   The next regular OPEC meeting is set for Nov. 21, although thatdoes not preclude a special session earlier if enough members deemit necessary.   The Kuwait News Agency, citing high-level senior industrysources, reported Tuesday that officials from Venezuela, Algeriaand Ecuador were considering a call for such a meeting. But theagency said the three nations had not officially contacted otherOPEC members.   The report also noted that major member states, such as Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia, might object to an emergency session becausethere is no guarantee it would have any positive effect on pricesand might even exacerbate the chaos now plaguing the cartel.   The Kuwaiti reports, coupled with the uncertainty caused by theU.S. destruction of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf,appear to have provided some temporary support for prices. Theprice of Brent crude from the North Sea was quoted in London inlate afternoon at $14.65 a barrel, up 15 cents a barrel fromTuesday's close. A month ago Brent, Europe's most widely tradegrade of oil, was going for $16.25 dollars a barrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediatecrude rose 27 cents Wednesday to $15.36 per 42-gallon barrel, aftera 15-cent jump the previous day.   Analysts nevertheless contend that prices are likely to fallfrom the existing range of $15 a barrel to $12 or even lower by theend of the summer.   Each one dollar drop in the price of crude oil theoreticallymeans a fall of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices,although oil companies usually do not pass on to consumers the fullprice decline.   The most common OPEC response to a sharp decline in oil pricesis to cut production, or at least give the impression of tighteningits output controls. Indeed, a report from the Paris-basedInternational Energy Agency showed Wednesday that OPEC output fellslightly in June to 18.4 million barrels a day, down from 18.7million in May.   Yet analysts say the cartel appears helpless to cut decisively,because Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies are unwilling, atleast for now, to contemplate any cuts in production.   ``We're still a very long way from OPEC doing what isnecessary'' to avert a further price decline, said Fergus MacLeod,an oil analyst at the investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd inLondon.   OPEC also is hurt by the continuing Iran-Iraq war, which haseffectively allowed Iraq to ignore OPEC rules and pump more oilthan any member except the Saudis.   At its last meeting in June, OPEC oil ministers failed to settletheir internal problems and simply left the existing system ofproduction quotas and prices unchanged, hoping oil demand wouldrise this summer.   Nothing has happened since then to improve chances of OPECagreeing on production cuts or other measures to stabilize themarket.   ``I don't foresee any OPEC move before the end of August,'' saidPierre Terzian, publisher of Petrostrategies, a Paris publication.``It seems they will let the prices come down ... to $10 or $12.''   OPEC's official oil price is $18 a barrel. But discipline in the13-nation cartel is so poor that most, if not all, members areoffering discounts to keep up their sales in a glutted market.   Worse, from OPEC's point of view, is a growing reluctance ofsome members to adhere to OPEC-decreed production quotas. TheUnited Arab Emirates, for example, has unilaterally declared thatit will pump up to 1.5 million barrels a day instead of the 948,000barrels it is allowed under the cartel agreement reaffirmed at lastmonth's meeting.   The UAE's move was likened earlier this week by Ecuador's oilminister, Fernando Santos, to ``an atomic bomb'' being dropped onthe market. Santos suggested that other members may soon decide toabandon the OPEC quota system to protect their own shares of themarket.   ``If a country does not respect its quota the other 12 membercountries will consider themselves free to produce as much as theyconsider necessary,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
