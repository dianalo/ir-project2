(the conferenceorganizers).andM;There are now three types of databases in use:andM;1.andP;  Traditional hierarchical databases -- with their &quot;classical navigation.&quot;andM;2.andP;  Relational databases -- which has become synonymous with SQL.andM;3.andP;  The new object-oriented databases -- which were the focus of attentionfor this presentation.andM;Dr.andP;  Schussel presented a list of the advantages of a relational databasemanagement system (DBMS) over a traditional one -- chiefly ease of use,coding, and maintenance.andP;  But, he pointed out, there is also a disadvantage:&quot;relational&quot; is significantly slower.andP;  Processor-to-processor transactionscan be &quot;two-to-three times slower.&quot;andP;  A mitigating factor can be that if youare using a distributed database running on a client/server network, you canuse much cheaper hardware.andP;  The choice may come down to time vs cost.andP;  If thecost factor is of sufficient importance -- with a promise of eliminating amainframe -- the choice may be made for you.andM;For relational databases, SQL has become the accepted standard.andP;  Theimportance of SQL, he claims, is that it is perceived to be superior to othersuch languages; and perception can be more important then reality.andM;He predicts that client/server networks running distributed databases usingSQL will &quot;fundamentally change&quot; our concept and use of all databases.andM;The concept of &quot;database&quot; is changing.andP;  It used to be that any database was acollection of alpha-numeric characters that could be arranged in atwo-dimensional matrix.andP;  Now users want to include images, video, voice, andanything and everything that is pertinent to the task at hand.andP;  SQL can'thandle all that.andP;  But perhaps &quot;object-oriented&quot; (OO) databases can.andP;  OO is&quot;the next generation of database technology!&quot;andM;&quot;Objects are abstractions of useful real world 'things' and can be thought ofas computer simulations of the behavior of the 'things.'&quot;  So said he.andM;CAN COMMENT: In CAN 247, I expressed my displeasure with any new technologythat must be explained in a new vocabulary and is unintelligible to all butthe priests of that technology.andP;  OO is becoming slightly less unclear (seebelow).andP;  But I am ensure how much can be attributed to progress in thetechnology and how much is simply due to exposure.andP;  If this technology is asgood as the priests claim, I hope they learn how to preach to the laymen(users).andP;  Some people will accept &quot;mysteries&quot; in church, but few will acceptthem at a keyboard.andM;First there were object-oriented processing systems (OOPS), now there is alsoan OO DBMS.andP;  The latter is an OOPS to which has been added:andM;* persistency (the objects are retained after the program stops)andM;* concurrencyandM;* integrityandM;* indexingandM;* query languageandM;* clusteringandM;* loggingandM;* recoveryandM;* audit trailsandM;There are few actual OO DBMSs.andP;  &quot;...  very early ...andP;  small market ...andP;  thestandards are not clear.&quot;andP;  (Those were his words.andP;  I would say: &quot;It's still atoy and there ain't no standards!&quot;)andM;He went into further detail attempting to explain OO.andP;  He definitelyadvocates at least investigating to see if you would benefit by using it.andP;  (Iagree that it is worthy of investigation.)andP;  There are signs that OO willbecome a technology to be reckoned with: &quot;Version 6 of UNIX will be builtwith C++.&quot;andP;  Which means it is intentionally being made compatible with OOprocessing.andM;If OO is as beneficial as the priests claim, why should anyone hesitate touse it?andP;  He listed some reasons:andM;* It will require &quot;total re-thinking and retraining of staff.&quot;andM;* &quot;There is rapid initial learning, but very slow development of expertise.&quot;andO;It is complex.andM;* &quot;Mainstream languages don't support OOPS.&quot;andP;  (Work is being done on a COBOLversion.)andM;* &quot;Performance is a real issue.&quot;andP;  (That is a warning!andP;  Be sure performance ispart of your investigation into OO.)andM;* OO is not compatible with some other modern approaches to programming(example: 4GL).andM;* There are no standards.andP;  (!)andM;The second of Dr. Schussel's major topics was CASE (computer assisted systemsengineering).andP;  &quot;...  the next generation of structured methods.&quot;andP;  &quot;... andO;automated tools [that] provide a mechanism for enforcing methodologies.&quot;andO;CASE provides a way of digitizing diagrams -- they may be slow to implement,but once captured by the computer they are available forever.andM;&quot;To be useful, CASE tools must be integrated&quot; -- ICASE.andP;  (We agree!)andP;  Thereare three ways to obtain ICASE:andM;1.andP;  &quot;Go with one vendor!&quot;andP;  That has limited acceptance because the bigvendors do not have complete systems.andM;2.andP;  &quot;Build custom bridges.&quot;andP;  That has limited long-term appeal -- the needfor bridges keeps changing.andM;3.andP;  &quot;Use a repository approach.&quot;andP;  &quot;That is the superior approach.&quot;andM;Dr.andP;  Schussel compared a repository approach to language translation: If youtry to translate word-for-word, or even phrase-for-phase, the result isusually unintelligible.andP;  A new (repository) approach is to translate to acommon denominator language and then to the target language.andP;  Thus, alltranslations would be from the common base.andM;CAN COMMENT: That sounds logical on first consideration -- but it meanseverything goes through two translations.andP;  Doesn't that double the chancesfor error?andM;&quot;Will it work?andP;  Nobody knows!&quot;andM;&quot;The repository is a database concept applied to programming logic.&quot;andP;  IBM andDEC have their own versions of a repository.andP;  The IBM product is called&quot;AD/Cycle&quot; and the DEC product has been newly christened &quot;Cohesion.&quot;andP;  &quot;DEC isone-to-two years ahead of IBM.&quot;andP;  Both products -- theoretically -- accomplishthe same goals: The program elements are reduced to a common denominator thatcan then be used by all other elements.andM;The repository concept is well enough advanced that competing versions arevying to become the standard.andP;  The adversaries are: IBM, DEC, ISO(international), and ANSI (for the U.S.).andP;  &quot;ISO and ANSI are very different!&quot;andM;The speaker's final topic was downsizing -- the attempt to make smaller --and cheaper -- machines carry the burden of a mainframe or mini.andM;&quot;Client/server [networks] can do many of the things that only mainframescould do.&quot;andP;  He listed some benefits to using C/S nets:andM;* much lower initial costsandM;* having multiple CPUs provides more reliabilityandM;* maintenance is simplerandM;* training is simplerandM;He highlighted the difference in cost: one MIPS on a 3090 costs about$100,000.andP;  One MIPS on a PC costs less than $1,000.andP;  He acknowledged thereare other costs involved and concluded that &quot;PC/workstation platforms willsave 40% to 60%.&quot;andM;To implement a C/S net, a collection of PCs is not enough.andP;  You also need aLAN.andP;  The PCs have to be connected in an organized manner.andP;  You will need:andM;* A LAN operating system.andM;- &quot;Novell owns the industry, but IBM is coming on strong with their OS/2customers.&quot;andM;* A server.andM;- He claims that a 386PC is sufficient to handle the task.andP;  A mini is nolonger required.andM;His conclusion: &quot;Minis are being replaced by PCs.&quot;andM;Users are not really interested in the particulars of the systems they use.andO;They only want their needs satisfied.andP;  They want a dedicated processor, theability to share data, and communications that are transparent.andP;  &quot;...  andthat equals a distributed database!&quot;andM;Although the term &quot;distributed database&quot; (DDB) has been bandied about for thelast ten years, there is not much software available to make it happen.andO;Sophisticated systems have not yet been written.andM;An interesting point: Most people think of a C/S net with one server and manyclients.andP;  However, it is very possible that you will want many servers forone client!andP;  You may want one server to handle your inventory, another serverfor supplier data, and a third for bill of materials processing -- allavailable to each client.andP;  He warned that some user needs are &quot;a level aboveC/S.&quot;andP;  His point: A simple C/S network does not automatically provideeverything.andP;  You may need to implement a DDB, too.andM;Dr.andP;  Schussel advocates downsizing.andP;  His list of benefits:andM;* &quot;Power to the people&quot;andM;* open systems -- vendor independenceandM;* distribution of staffandM;* much lower hardware costsandM;* somewhat lower software costsandM;* &quot;shrink-wrapped software&quot; is availableandM;* graphical user interfaces are availableandM;* &quot;more flexibility under changing business conditions&quot;andM;But, he warned, you may suffer higher staff costs because you will need morepeople -- though some of them will be at lower salaries.andP;  And that's not all.andO;Downsizing requires:andM;* new expertiseandM;- &quot;Loads of education and time for trial and error.&quot;andM;- hardware expertiseandM;- LAN expertiseandM;- DBMS expertiseandM;- operations expertiseandM;-- reliabilityandM;-- securityandM;-- recoveryandM;- programming expertiseandM;CAN COMMENT: Isn't life interesting!andP;  For years, hardware vendors have beenpreaching that the ultimate goal should be to save people costs -- you do soby buying more and more powerful hardware.andP;  Now we are being told to savehardware costs by increasing our people costs!andM;&quot;C/S and DDB technology is immature and complex.&quot;andP;  You will need a databaseadministrator and technical support.andP;  &quot;LANs have a poor track record forreliability.&quot;andP;  &quot;LAN network failures are more common than hardwired minis.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: I left the presentation thinking there are some usable conceptsinvolved in all this -- but I would not pull the plug on a working systemuntil I was damn sure the substitute was going to be an improvement!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
