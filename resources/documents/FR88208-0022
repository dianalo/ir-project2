It was determined that a massiverupture of the aft pressure bulkhead of the Model 767 airplane could resultin a significant pressure rise in the Body Section (BS) 48 and possiblyan overpressurization of the vertical fin inspar area through a failedfin access door or through skin-to-body cutouts used for routing of electricalwiring and hydraulic tubing between BS 48 and the fin inspar cavity. Overpressurizationof the vertical fin could cause damage to the inspar structure and hydraulicsystems which, in turn, could preclude the airplane's continued safe flightand landing.The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767-53-0025,dated June 4, 1987, which provides instructions for installation of sealplates over electrical wiring and hydraulic tubing cutouts on the fin-to-bodyskin to preclude an overpressurization of the fin from the BS 48 cavity.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, an AD is proposed which would require installationof seal plates, in accordance with the service bulletin previously mentioned,to reduce the cutout area and thereby reduce the potential for overpressurizationof the fin in the event of a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead.It should be noted that, as an additional measure to address this unsafecondition, the FAA previously issued AD 86-19-07, Amendment 39-5402 (51FR 30328; August 26, 1986), which requires reinforcement of the fin accessdoors.It is estimated that 77 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 3 hours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 perhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $9,240.For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involvesa proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 and(2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); andit is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities because few, if any, Model 767 airplanes are operated by smallentities. A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this actionis contained in the regulatory docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofPart 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
