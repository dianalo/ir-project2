You know that you'll never make it toIshpeming County on an empty stomach; you know that a stop at Bob'sBelly Busters could be fatal.   What is a gas-guzzling gastronome to do?   Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller suggest that you mix threetablespoons of Dijon mustard, two tablespoons of dry white wine, ahalf cup of minced red onion, two teaspoons of dried rosemary andsalt and pepper. Spread on a butterflied pork tenderloin; wrap infoil.   Then stick it in your car engine and drive 250 miles.   Voila!   ``It really does taste very good, smells wonderfully when you'redriving along and get to a toll booth,'' said Scheller, co-authorof ``Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only! Guide to Cooking on YourCar Engine'' ($7.95; Villard Books).   ``It gives you a great sense of accomplishment to do somethingas formidable as a pork tenderloin,'' agrees his partner, Maynard.   Think of Maynard, a 39-year-old travel writer, as the JamesBeard of the Buick; think of Scheller, a 41-year-old photographer,as the Paul Prudhomme of the Pontiac. Together they have produced acompendium that gives new meaning to the phrase ``meals on wheels.''   The two friends have been cooking on car engines since thesummer of 1984, when they were returning from a canoe trip inCanada and got a hankering for some of that good smoked meat fromSchwartz's deli in Montreal.   A quick detour later, they had their pastrami. But they alsowere vaguely discontented _ wouldn't it be nice to savor a HOTsmoked meat sandwich?   In Burlington, Vt., they pulled off the interstate and openedthe hood of Scheller's 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit. They spied a nicespot under the air filter, and stuck the foil-wrapped meat there.   An hour later, at a rest stop, they enjoyed steaming smoked meat.   ``Best of all,'' they write, ``we nearly made two women at thenext picnic table choke on their sprouts when they saw that insteadof a busted fan belt, we had actually just dragged our lunch fromthe Rabbit's greasy maw.''   That started their fascination with car cuisine. They have spentthe past five years developing recipes _ Thruway Thighs, ToGrandmother's House Road Turkey, Blackened Roadfish and Lead FootStuffed Cabbage, among them.   Each recipe includes the estimated mileage required to cook themeal. For those who are not zipping along Route 80 _ who arestalled on, say, Philadelphia's Schuylkill Expressway _ the authorsprovide cooking times.   A lot depends on the size of the car's engine, and whether thecar has a commodious and secure place to put comestibles, a placewhere the food will not be crushed or wedged into the engine'smoving parts or knocked to the ground to become road pizza.   ``You try to retrieve an eggplant in traffic, and we're notresponsible,'' warn the authors.   Exhaust manifolds are good; so are injector housings. Maynardand Scheller compare the culinary virtues of different cars,ranging from the 1965 Jaguar XK-E (``the best setup we have evercome across for easy-access, top-of-the-engine cooking'') to the1988 Toyota Camry, which offers a space next to the right wheelwell that functions as a bun warmer.   Since the Japanese culture ``places no great stock in bakedgoods, we can only assume that this was yet another canny ploy toplay to the American market,'' Maynard and Scheller write.   Through it all, there is an emphasis on safety _ partly at theinsistence of the publishers' lawyers. Do not interfere with movingparts or block the flow of air or insert, check or remove food withthe motor running. ``Come back with the same number of fingers youstarted with,'' the authors say.   Also, wrap the food three times in aluminum foil, and don't usetoo much liquid. ``No car owner's manual calls for basting theengine.''   Scheller says a lot of people have reacted to the concept of carcooking with a wince, convinced that ``under the hood there's someindescribable collection of gunky parts that would ruin food.''   The authors calmly explain that the food is wrapped, so enginegrime in no problem. And exhaust fumes are channeled outside,through the exhaust pipe.   Do Maynard and Scheller really cook this way? They insist theydo.   ``It's a nice way to have a hot meal waiting somewhere down theroad,'' says Maynard. ``We don't do it all the time, of course.When we're driving to a restaurant, for example, it's hard tojustify bringing food along.''   And Maynard and Scheller do not suggest that all foods areappropriately cooked in a Nissan Sentra. ``We once boned a wholecapon, stuffed it with alternating layers of chicken mousseline,duxelles and spinach souffle, and wrapped it in brioche. But we hadthe good sense to cook it in an oven, not on a car engine,'' theywrite.   Other recipes, they say, just don't pay off.   ``For instance, you could bake a potato on a car engine, butyou'd have to drive to Des Moines,'' Maynard says. ``When you'reall done, you have a baked potato. So what.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Fri Oct. 20</NOTE></DOC>
