For Capital Cities Chairman Thomas Murphy and President Daniel Burke, it was a huge risk. In 35 years, they had built a profitable company based on penny-pinching management of local TV stations. Now the visitors, ABC President Frederick S. Pierce and programming head Brandon Stoddard, were trying to talk them into the most expensive film in history.    The four men sat next to the fireplace in Mr. Murphy's elegant, wood-trimmed office and went over the numbers. The Capital Cities officials looked a little pale. They had never considered a project so massive.    A few days later they gave their answer: Go ahead.    &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; finally makes its debut Sunday. But even before it starts, the longest, costliest miniseries -- 32 hours and $110 million -- is a guaranteed money-loser. If it gets great ratings, Capital Cities/ABC Inc. will lose $20 million. If it flops, the losses will multiply.    So why did &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; get made? Why did the old ABC take it on, knowing it could lose millions? And how could the new owners, who were supposed to impose financial discipline on the profligate network, let it fly?    The making of &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is the story of how ABC's old managers wanted a program so badly they agreed to one of the worst deals in television -- and how the new owners, well aware of the hazards, passed up the chance to kill it. Financial considerations were almost beside the point. The production survived because of decisions based on fear and an accident of timing.    Mr. Murphy says while he wouldn't approve the project today, doing so was right under the circumstances: He had to rule on it just as Capital Cities was buying ABC. He fretted killing the miniseries might upset the ranks and alarm a wary Hollywood.    &quot;There was a lot of talk that we were cost-cutters,&quot; says Mr. Murphy, who once saved money at the first TV station he managed by painting only the front half of the building. &quot;We wanted to make a statement that we were committed to quality programming.&quot; He concedes the high cost but hopes for big ratings.    That even a huge hit would lose $20 million is bitter testimony to how much television has changed since early 1984. &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; was plotted in a still-robust era for the networks.    &quot;Television was in its heyday, making a lot of money. We were used to taking chances,&quot; says Mark H. Cohen, a 30-year ABC executive who retired earlier this year. The mentality back then, Mr. Cohen says, was: &quot;We could always go back and renegotiate if we got into trouble.&quot;    The production's two most passionate supporters, Messrs. Pierce and Stoddard, began planning it in early 1984. They were eager to exploit the success of &quot;The Winds of War,&quot; a $40 million miniseries based on an earlier Wouk novel.    They had two problems. Paramount Pictures Corp., which had the rights to both Wouk novels, had made &quot;The Winds of War&quot; for ABC, but it refused to gamble on the pricey sequel. Moreover, the author, who had unprecedented control over the creative and commercial content of &quot;Winds,&quot; insisted on similar terms for &quot;War and Remembrance.&quot;    To win the support of Paramount and Mr. Wouk, ABC made concessions that would cost it at least $50 million.    Mr. Pierce wanted the project badly. He felt the story line was even better than &quot;Winds&quot; and envisioned a far bigger sequel, a definitive film history of World War II, &quot;the most impactful event of our lives.&quot;    Mr. Pierce, who left ABC after the merger and now runs his own production company, had decided ABC wouldn't seek the rights to the 1988 Summer Olympics because of possible unrest in South Korea. He needed a blockbuster program to counter the Games.    But he may also have been guided by assumptions of the networks' &quot;can-do&quot; era of old. A supersalesman who reveled in big-splash programming, Mr. Pierce says it never occurred to him to reject the deal.    &quot;Paramount had the rights,&quot; he says. &quot;The project could've just sat there.&quot; So why not let it sit? &quot;That's like saying do nothing. That's difficult.&quot;    Paramount, a unit of Gulf andamp; Western Inc., refused to make the sequel because &quot;The Winds of War&quot; had been a costly debacle for the studio. &quot;Not a day went by that this damn thing wasn't shooting somewhere in the world, every day for three years,&quot; says a rueful Barry Diller, then Paramount's chairman. So he called ABC's Mr. Pierce and told him, &quot;Here's your chance -- you can buy it.&quot;    He set tough terms. ABC would have to make the mammoth miniseries on its own and cover all costs. It would have to pay the author's $4 million fee and pay Paramount $2.5 million. And though Paramount hadn't put up one cent, ABC would have to let it handle overseas sales and keep a 35% cut, plus expenses.    &quot;I recommended against it,&quot; says Herb Granath, president of ABC's videocassette and cable businesses. &quot;I thought we'd certainly do as good a job as Paramount&quot; on overseas sales. Current studio officials won't comment, but Paramount's take could come to $25 million.    The concessions ABC made to the author would prove even costlier. Mr. Wouk, who wasn't available for an interview, wanted to dictate how many ads could air, when breaks could occur and which products were suitable, says Mr. Diller, who had negotiated with the author. A private man of Jewish Orthodox faith who served in the Navy in World War II, Mr. Wouk refused to let his story and its wrenching tale of Auschwitz be interrupted by the likes of an ad for deodorant. He also insisted that no major part of the story line could be cut, blocking ABC from reducing costs by scrapping scenes.    Similar restrictions applied to &quot;Winds,&quot; but they would prove devastating on the far larger scale of the sequel. Shampoos, soaps and other hygiene products were forbidden. So were bug sprays, soft drinks, fast food and other consumer staples. ABC could air only six minutes of ads each hour instead of seven, which would cost it $16 million. With so many products deemed ineligible, ad prices dropped -- a hit of $8.5 million more, an ABC executive says.    And though ABC spent $65 million on TV spots promoting the miniseries, it isn't allowed to promote other ABC shows during an episode, when millions of new viewers may be tuned in. &quot;Do you want to know how much it depresses me? It depresses me a lot,&quot; says Mark Zakarin, an ABC marketing vice president.    But ABC's Mr. Pierce approved the pact, with his board's backing at several junctures. ABC's salesmen &quot;moaned and groaned,&quot; but he felt it was the only way to get the rights to a great story.    ABC's new owners were acutely aware of the potential for disaster when Messrs. Pierce and Stoddard visited Mr. Murphy's office late in 1985. They had a choice: They could gamble on the project -- then budgeted at $90 million -- and hope at best to break even. Or they could kill it and take a $17 million write-off.    Mr. Stoddard, president of ABC Entertainment, told the two newcomers that canceling the miniseries would pose the bigger risk. &quot;There was a real suspicion on Hollywood's part that these guys weren't going to pay for quality,&quot; he says. &quot;If they didn't go ahead when everyone knew it was on the table, we would never have gotten rid of that label.&quot;    Because ABC spends $2 billion a year on shows, Hollywood might have been more forgiving than he contends. But Mr. Stoddard also told his new bosses that scuttling the production he'd spent two years developing &quot;would make my job much more difficult in this town.&quot;    Messrs. Murphy and Burke took that as a warning that Mr. Stoddard might leave the company if his project died. He &quot;had his heart set on it,&quot; Mr. Murphy says, &quot;and he was very important to us.&quot;    Filming began on Jan. 6, 1986, three days after the Capital Cities/ABC merger was completed. Messrs. Murphy and Burke would later reconsider their decision, but not before the project had snowballed. Mr. Murphy tried to ease the ad restrictions, visiting Mr. Wouk three times to plead his case. He was rejected each time.    ABC has guaranteed advertisers an audience of 20.2% of all U.S. homes. (&quot;The Winds of War&quot; in 1983 lured 38.6%.) Even then, ABC would lose money. It spent over $3.4 million for each hour, yet will get only $2.5 million an hour in ad sales after agency commissions.    But no one is sure the fickle TV audience will stay with a 32-hour program. (The first 18 hours air this month, the rest next spring.) If it bombs, ABC would owe advertisers free spots to make up for skimpy audiences, and losses would soar.    Despite that risk, Mr. Pierce, the former ABC head, says he's proud of the project, &quot;and it wouldn't have happened without me.&quot; Mr. Murphy of Capital Cities/ABC says simply that such a costly miniseries won't happen again.    But his prized programmer, Mr. Stoddard, won't say never: &quot;Some other people might. But I've been around this business long enough to know. Never is almost always wrong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
