The 15-member committee also called the plan flawed, saying itdid not include Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories,addressed the plan to Jordan, and ignored the Palestine LiberationOrganization as the representative of the Palestinian people.   ``The committee sees that this proposal does not concern thePalestinian people because it fails to recognize their existence asa nation,'' the committee said in a statement after a meeting attheir headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia.   It said Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Stripwould continue their 17-month-old uprising. The violence has killed475 Palestinians and 21 Israelis.   The Arabic-language statement was sent to The Associated Pressin Nicosia. The committee is lead by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat andincludes representatives from various Palestinian groups.   Israel's Cabinet on Sunday voted 20-6 to approve Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir's election plan for the occupied lands.   The plan rejected negotiations with the PLO and sidesteppedcontroversial points such as foreign supervision of the elections,participation of 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem and a timetablefor the balloting.   Israel has been under world pressure to adopt a peace planesince the PLO decided last November to renounce terrorism andrecognize Israel's right to exist.   The PLO statement said Shamir's plan did not take into accountall the international resolutions, including U.N. Security Councilresolutions 242 and 338, calling for withdrawal of Israeli forcesfrom Arab lands occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.   ``In a further challenge of Arab and international will, theIsraeli government addressed this perfidious proposal to theJordanian government, which had formally disengaged itself from theoccupied West Bank and recognized the Palestinian state,'' thestatement said.   It said world opinion supported the idea that the Palestinianpeople were entitled to self-determination and the best frameworkfor negotiating this goal is an international Middle East peaceconference.   ``The proposal by the Israeli government exposes the essence ofthe call for elections as being no more than a farce designed todeceive world opinion and consolidate the occupation, accompaniedby an escalation of its iron-fist crackdown against the Palestinianpeople and the intefadeh (uprising),'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
