A looming shortage of capital is one of the biggest threats toreform in the former Soviet bloc and efforts to revamp the worldwidetrading system, officials said Monday at an annual meeting ofleaders of private and public banks from 22 nations.   Deficit reduction is the ``acid test'' for improving the U.S.position in the world economy, former Federal Reserve Chairman PaulA. Volcker told the bankers gathered for the International MonetaryConference.   ``I submit to you that no other single measure we could takewould be so important in supporting the potential for trade anddevelopment in the 1990s,'' he said in a closed-door address to thebankers, according to a text of his remarks.   ``Frankly, what has concerned me the most has been the tendencyfor the United States to retreat from economic leadership in recentyears,'' he said.   Volcker, who now runs a New York investment house, told reporterslater that the United States should stop criticizing Japan for itslow consumer spending and high savings rate and instead get its ownfiscal house in order.   Nigel Lawson, former chancellor of the Exchequer in GreatBritain, said there are signs that private savings worldwide are notmatching investment needs, ``a discrepancy that will be furtherexacerbated by the new investment opportunities now beginning toarise in Eastern Europe.''   ``It is important that governments cease to make demands onprivate savings, whether at home or overseas, by running budgetdeficits,'' he said, according to a copy of his remarks. Lawson didnot specifically mention the United States.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the bankers at an opensession that they must help meet the funding needs of Eastern Europe.   ``As more countries embrace the principles of economic freedom,creditors will need to stand ready to lend their support,'' he said.``You in this room cannot simply be bystanders to this process.''   But Lawson said in his remarks that commercial bank lending tothe governments of Eastern Europe is not the answer to thosenations' needs for capital. ``Governments, for their part, mustrigorously refrain from encouraging or urging banks to make suchloans'' due to their risky nature, he said.   Brady outlined current U.S. efforts to help fund moves away fromgovernment-owned industry both in Eastern Europe and South America.He said the United States has committed nearly $1 billion over threeyears for Poland and Hungary, and that it is the largest contributorto the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Bradydid not call for any increases in spending to help these nations.   ``Our challenge in the developed countries is to encourage andnurture these impulses for economic freedom,'' he said. ``But let'sface it: The world is short of capital, and governments are shorterstill.''   He said the developed world also must work to maintain steadyeconomic growth and open markets to make it easier for these nationsto succeed.   Volcker expressed optimism about the potential for internationaltrade and development in the 1990s in light of the decline ofcommunism.   ``After all, if things go reasonably well, 100 million people inEastern Europe, 300 million in Russia and over a billion in Chinahave the theoretical potential for growing 5 to 10 percent a year,like the East Asians in the 1980s,'' he said.   But Volcker cautioned that there are several potential pitfallsfor that optimistic scenario, including a shortage of capital andthe possibility for trade frictions that could lead to protectionistpolicies.   If current negotiations aimed at liberalizing the global tradingsystem end in disarray later this year, Congress may act to restrictimports and foreign investment, he said.   ``That would, in turn, certainly reinforce those in Europe whowould like to restrict access to their markets,'' he added.   If such trade restrictions coincided with a recession and asoftening in the value of the dollar, serious damage to the worldeconomy could result, Volcker said.</TEXT></DOC>
