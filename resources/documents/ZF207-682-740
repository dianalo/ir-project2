there is another big announcement setfor September 26, when new 3090 processor models are expected, and the diskscould be included in that.andM;- o -andM;Also whistling in the dark are the people that expect Ferranti InternationalSignal Plc shares, suspended at 73.5 pence, to resume trading at around 50pence: it is now pretty clear that the amount Ferranti will have to write offon ISC Technologies contracts runs into hundreds of millions of pounds -payments on some contracts appears to have been nothing more than thecompany's own money being returned to it, and that if trading in Ferrantiever does resume - the company could well be acquired instead - the shareswill be changing hands for little more than option money.andM;- o -andM;DEC UK has denied a report in the Wall Street Journal that the proposedconstruction of a $100m technical centre at its planned new headquarters inReading, Berkshire (CI No 824) has been cancelled: it says that plans weresubmitted to Wokingham District Council some nine months ago and were refusedplanning permission, DEC then lodged an appeal and is still awaiting theoutcome;

it looks for factory loadings in Europe and Japan tobegin to improve in the fourth quarter because it will for the first time dofoundry work, producing semiconductors for other electronics companies undertheir own label;

designation for its IBMulators on the AS/400 (itdid), and now Bob Djurdjevic has put the same question: IBM believed thewhole thing had blown over, but National Advanced says it was simplydeflected from pursuing it by the takeover of the business by Hitachi Ltd andElectronic Data Systems Corp, but that it now intended to get the mattersettled with IBM; IBM told Reuters that it didn't believe there was aconflict over the name.andM;- o -andM;The MTel UK Ltd participant in the InTouch Personal Communications Networkconsortium put together by Gooding Investments Ltd, majority shareholder inRace Electronics Ltd (CI No 1,263) is the UK subsidiary of MobileTelecommunication Technologies Corp, Jackson, Mississippi.andM;- o -andM;Northern Telecom Ltd has been granted a supply agreement worth $38m by theJamaica Telephone Co covering a full range of telecommunications equipment tobe offered to business and residential customers in Jamaica: included are theDMS-100 digital exchange, fibre optic transmission products, including afully duplicated circuit for the Kingston area, maintenance systems, MeridianSL-1 private branch exchanges and Norstar key systems.andM;- o -andM;Novell Inc has shipped the first production copies of its NetWare 386 Version3.0, but users who want support for TCP/IP or AppleTalk protocols must waitfor Version 3.1, expected early next year.andM;- o -andM;Once upon a time there was a small but perfectly formed weekly Frenchcomputer magazine pitched mainly at large IBM users; it was the mostexpensive in the market, because as its own tag said &quot;if you want the best,you have to pay for it&quot;; it was doing very well, but the founder finally gottired and decided to sell out to a &quot;major publishing company&quot;, whichinstantly glossified and made it look as much like a personal computermagazine as possible; the final coup was delivered when it appointed as themagazine's art editor the man who had been art director of the French editionof Playboy magazine, and now the once-thriving magazine is just gettingthinner and thinner...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
