In the second sweep, at Los Angeles International Airport Mondaynight, agents also nabbed a Mexican they described as a principal inthe alleged smuggling operation. The man, whom police did notidentify, was arrested for investigation of transporting illegalaliens.   The first sweep had been at Hartsfield Atlanta InternationalAirport early Monday after Eastern's Flight 80, en route to New Yorkfrom Los Angeles, touched down for a stopover.   U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service officials stressedthat several independent smugglers may have used Eastern's Flight 80and that the group arrested in Los Angeles was not necessarilylinked to people seized in Atlanta. They also said the chiefsmuggling operators remain at large.   ``We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who areutilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from theborder from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast,'' said ThomasGaines, assistant Western District director for the INS.   At a news conference at the INS' Los Angeles office, Gainesspeculated that the alleged smuggling operation may have gone aheadMonday despite the arrests in Atlanta because the tickets hadalready been bought.   In Atlanta, the illegal aliens said they paid as much as $4,000as part of a package deal to help start a new life in New York.   Of those seized at the Los Angeles airport's Terminal Six, 54were from Mexico, seven were from El Salvador, four were fromColombia and four were from Guatemala, said Los Angeles INS ActingDistrict Director Donald Looney.   INS spokesman Joe Flanders said most of the people, if found tobe illegal aliens, would be given the choice of going home orrequesting a deportation hearing. Flanders said some might be heldas material witnesses.   One alien seized in Atlanta, Juan De La Cruz-Rodriguez, 34, saidhe had come to the United STates to earn some money to send to hiswife and three young sons in the Dominican Republic. He told TheAtlanta Journal a smuggler in Mexico helped him and a dozen otherscross the border, then arranged to have them transported by flatbedtruck to Los Angeles.   He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave thesmuggler almost $1,000. Holding up a quarter, he said, ``That's allI have left.''   Gaines said the arrests at the Los Angeles airport resulted fromtips, but said the operation was not coordinated with the Atlantasweep.   Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the INS in Atlanta, said thousands ofillegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on thedaily Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York. He saidFlight 80 might have been popular because no transfers were involvedand rates might have been cheaper.   Gaines refused to speculate on how many people may have used theflights, but said the technique is not new, recalling at least onesweep in recent years that netted 200 people.   Both Thomas in Atlanta and Looney in Los Angeles said EasternAirlines was not connected with the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
