The quickly arranged meeting was held at the State Department atthe behest of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose politicalfuture could hinge on the outcome of the dispute. It also iscausing strains in the Western alliance.   For nearly four hours, West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenbergdebated the merits of keeping and improving U.S.-built Lancemissiles in their country with Secretary of State James A. BakerIII, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, thenational security assistant to President Bush.   The issue could disrupt the summit meeting Bush will attend withthe leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic Treaty Organizationcountries in Brussels at the end of May unless it is resolvedbefore then.   Kohl is concerned that his political career could be imperiledunless he deters the strong drive by the United States, Britain andFrance to maintain the Lances on West German soil. The West Germanelectorate is turning more toward disarmament, and the left-leaningSocial Democrats and Greens are gaining ground.   Kohl is closely watching local elections to be held in June.   As they left the State Department, Genscher and Stoltenberg gaveno indication if they made any headway. ``Good afternoon,''Stoltenberg said to waiting reporters, declining to stop. He andGenscher then climbed into their black limousine. They werescheduled to return quickly to Bonn.   Baker, meanwhile, issued a brief statement that described themeeting as ``useful and friendly.'' He said the two sides explainedtheir positions.   ``As a result,'' Baker said, ``we understand their positionbetter and they understand ours better.''   He did not suggest the gulf between the two had narrowed. ``Wewill continue our discussions in an effort to reach an agreementwithin the alliance,'' Baker said.   Earlier, as West Germans met with the senior U.S. officials,Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokesman, said,``Secretary Baker has said many times that it would be preferableif we could move to modernize our short-range nuclear weapons,although we understand the Federal Republic's problem regarding thetiming of any such decision.   ``And he has said that we think it would be a mistake to engagein arms control negotiations on SNF (Short-range Nuclear Forces).''   Ms. Tutwiler said Baker`s message to the West German visitorswas that ``we should make an effort to work this out throughnegotiations with the Federal Republic and our allies before thesummit.''   Bush said he had appealed to Kohl ``that we keep NATO together,that we stay together.''   He said the West German leader, who arranged the trip byGenscher and Stoltenberg in a telephone call to Bush last Friday,``knows my view that there must not be any unilateral fait accomplihere.''   And Cheney, speaking at the National Defense University beforethe meeting, said negotiating now with the Soviets over themissiles would be a mistake because of the Soviets' overwhelmingsuperiority in non-nuclear forces.   ``For the forseeable future, certainly as long as there isoverwhelming Soviet conventional superiority,'' Cheney said,``there's absolutely no rationale at all for us to talk abouteliminating or significantly reducing those short-range forces.''   The United States, Britain and France are concerned thatnegotiating the missiles issue with the Soviets could wind updepriving the NATO alliance of ground-based nuclear weaponry,leaving the West Europeans vulnerable to stronger Warsaw Pactconventional forces.   Opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenalof Lances spurs their possible use and that a nuclear conflictcould not be confined to the battlefield but would spread to aworld-threatening war.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly to Bonn onSunday to try to persuade Kohl to suspend his campaign forU.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue. Kohl has support amongseveral of the smaller NATO countries, including Norway, Belgium,The Netherlands and Denmark.   In another matter relating to NATO, Cheney disclosed Monday thatabout half of the troop cuts he has ordered for the Army in fiscal1990 will involve soldiers deployed to Europe.   The defense chief, who delivered a speech at the NationalDefense University Monday afternoon, said the cuts should not be``perceived as any significant change in the U.S. commitment toEurope.''   Cheney explained he had ordered the Army to pare its ranks byabout 7,900 slots, and that about 4,000 represented troops ``thathave been previously assigned to Intermediate-range NuclearForces.''   The Army's Pershing II nuclear missile force is being withdrawnfrom Europe and destroyed under terms of the INF Treaty with theSoviet Union.   ``There will be a reduction of a few thousand, but it'sbasically in connection with bringing home the Pershing IIdeployments,'' Cheney said.</TEXT></DOC>
