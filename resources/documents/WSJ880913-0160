In discussions Monday with U.S. Commerce Secretary William Verity, Japan's minister of posts and telecommunications offered to slightly alter regulations that govern international value-added networks in Japan, a Telecommunications Ministry official said. Called VANs, the networks connect computers over phone lines.    Washington had complained that Tokyo's regulations hamper some U.S. VAN vendors' operations here. The compromise is particularly aimed at satisfying the company that sparked the spat: International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, N.Y.    Mr. Verity said Washington would study the compromise, according to the ministry official. The official added that Mr. Verity and Telecommunications Minister Masaaki Nakayama agreed that &quot;it would be desirable to quickly settle the issue before it becomes political.&quot; Washington trade officials hinted earlier this month that the U.S. could apply trade sanctions against Japan unless Tokyo offered a solution to the VAN issue.    Japan's Telecommunications Ministry originally wanted all providers of international VANs to offer a standard &quot;X75&quot; protocol -- a set of rules that determine how computers respond to each other in the network. The X75 standard, recommended by an international standard-setting body, provides a common language between networks that otherwise speak different internal languages.    But Washington complained that mandatory protocol impeded U.S. companies that lead in VAN technologies and often have built networks around their own unique protocols, especially IBM. The regulation forced a company to connect its network to anyone who wanted to plug in. &quot;Mandatory interconnection is not the proper approach,&quot; Mr. Verity said in Tokyo last week.    On paper, the Japanese concession still doesn't offer the completely free market the U.S. wants. The Telecommunications Ministry said it will grant licenses to a company that uses a unique protocol if the company's business plan stipulates a willingness to provide the technology to connect with other, incompatible, networks and if the company promises to divulge certain technical details.    IBM officials wouldn't comment on the proposal. &quot;We just haven't had time to review and assess this latest proposal,&quot; an IBM official said.    Still, interconnection is no longer mandatory under the plan -- IBM could refuse a connection to another network if the two didn't agree on business terms. In effect, the plan would let IBM participate in the market on its own terms while the Telecommunications Ministry won't appear to be backing down completely.    Meanwhile, Mr. Verity voiced dissatisfaction with Japan's progress on other technology-trade fronts. Japan still isn't buying enough U.S. supercomputers, he said. Washington says Japanese public institutions don't buy U.S. supercomputers -- extremely fast multimillion-dollar machines -- because they encourage Japanese makers to sell at unfair discounts.    Mr. Verity also said that although the U.S. was selling more semiconductors in Japan, American market share here isn't growing. A 1986 U.S.-Japan agreement called for Japan to increase its chip purchases from the U.S. But Washington slapped import restrictions on certain Japanese goods last year after the American share of Japan's market didn't grow toward the 20% the U.S. wants.    &quot;That is still our target,&quot; Mr. Verity said. &quot;We aren't going to take the sanctions off until we get closer to the goal of the agreement.&quot;    ---   Damon Darlin contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
