(Global PositioningSystems satellites)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brewin, Bob.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The launch rate of Air Force Global Positioning System satellites(GPS) will be increased to one a month to give more access time tothe troops in the Persian Gulf.andP;  The rate, which is beingincreased by the US Air Force, will boost the GPS constellation to17 out of 21 planned satellites.andP;  Troops in the Persian Gulf willnow be furnished with accurate navigational information about 17hours a day because of the increase.andP;  The satellites, which arepart of a $10 billion Air Force contract, allow users on theground to precisely plot their positions and speeds throughtriangulation with GPS broadcast satellites.andP;  The satellites arebuilt by Rockwell International Satellite and Space ElectronicsDiv.andP;  The satellites are described as one of the 'hottestcommodities' on the Arabian peninsula, and the Air Force statesthat they are of paramount importance to ground units.andP;  Accordingto industry sources, when GPS is descrambled, commercial receiverscan determine position to an accuracy of 25 meters.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SatellitesMilitaryTracking SystemsUnited States.
