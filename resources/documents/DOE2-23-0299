One of the tasks includedin this program was the characterization of beta fields at DOE facilities.Beta measurements were made using silicon detectors, scintillation spectrometers,and passive spectrometers. At operating DOE facilities where beta emitterswere encountered, measurement was usually complicated by the presenceof low-energy photons, and the source-to-detector geometry was oftenhard to define. Backscatter and low-energy beta particles were problemsfor both calibration and field measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
