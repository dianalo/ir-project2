The launch had been scheduled for Feb. 28 but was postponedbecause of a strike by technicians. It was rescheduled for Saturdaybut delayed again when high winds caused two ``umbilical cables'' todisconnect as the gantry was being pulled away.   Seventeen minutes, 41 seconds after liftoff at 8:29 p.m., theAriane 4 attained orbit, and after seven more minutes it hadreleased the two satellites. Ariane 4 is the most powerful launcherin the Ariane series.   Put into orbit were JCSAT-1, a Japanese commercial communicationsatellite, and MOP-1, a European meteorological satellite.   The JDSAT-1, built by Hughes Aircraft Co. of Los Angeles for theJapanese Communication Satellite Co., is Japan's first commercialcommunication satellite.   MOP-1 is the fourth weather satellite for the European SpaceAgency. It will send weather pictures every half hour to stations onEarth.   It was the agency's second launch this year and the 11th straightsuccessful operation.   The first Ariane rocket, an Ariane 1, was launched a decade ago.The agency has had four failed flights since its rocket becameoperational.   The last failure was in 1986 and resulted in a delay in theprogram of more than a year.Launches resumed in September 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
