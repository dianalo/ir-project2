It isthe first time the 32-year-old has seen the symbolic foods bywhich Jews everywhere celebrate Passover, the festival oftheir liberation from the Pharoah's Egypt. In a thick Russianaccent, Mr. Shiliar struggles with the Hebrew recited at thefeast. &quot;Last year we were slaves,&quot; he reads. &quot;This year weare free.&quot;   Last year, Mr. Shiliar was in Leningrad, where his onlycontact with his Jewish heritage was the designation &quot;Jew&quot;inscribed on his identity papers. In February, he arrived inIsrael on one of the crowded night flights that aredisgorging fatigued and disoriented immigrants at a rate ofmore than 200 a day.</LP><TEXT>   Israeli planners say that by summer, a million Soviet Jewswill have requested exit visas. Now that the U.S. no longerviews all Soviet Jews as political refugees, and has limitedthe number it accepts, the vast majority are destined forIsrael. The numbers are stunning: Between 1980 and 1988, only15,752 Jews arrived in Israel from the Soviet Union. But whenemigration rules were relaxed, the flood began. In the firstthree months of this year more than 17,000 arrived. In asingle 24-hour period last week, 1,000 landed.   Such a huge migration -- Israel's total population is just4.4 million -- could change the face of the Jewish state.&quot;The future of Israel, perhaps all the future of the Zionistideal, depends on this,&quot; says Natan Sharansky, the formerSoviet dissident who now heads a lobby group for newimmigrants in Israel.   A look at the Russians who have arrived so far suggests afuture Israel enriched by talent and technical skill,confronted by economic challenges -- and moving dramaticallyto the political right.   The newcomers are suspicious of socialism and fearful ofthe echoes of anti-Semitism they hear from Arabs opposed totheir immigration. Since they are immediately eligible tovote, their ballots at the next election could well giveright-wing parties the edge they need to end Israel'spolitical equipoise.   Their presence is already being felt. On most Fridays forthe past two years, Ruth Barkai, a kibbutz-born Israeli, hasdonned black clothing as a symbol of mourning and stood in avigil protesting the occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip. Her group, Women in Black, is accustomed to abuse fromIsraelis opposed to their dovish stance. But she says she hasbeen disturbed lately by the number of Russians heckling her.&quot;Some of them can't even speak Hebrew yet,&quot; she says. &quot;Itreally bothers me that these people, who care so much abouthuman rights in the Soviet Union, seem to forget what a humanright is the minute they set foot in Israel.&quot;   Leonid Kelbert explains why that might seem so. The45-year-old has already voted once, in the December 1988election soon after his arrival from Leningrad. He choseMoledet, one of the small right-wing parties that advocatesexpelling Arabs from Israeli-occupied lands. &quot;I wanted thisoption to be part of the political reality, to put pressureon the Arabs as they apply pressure to us,&quot; Mr. Kelbert says.He was an award-winning documentary maker in the SovietUnion, but he once was jailed there for 15 days on an assaultcharge that he says was trumped up because he was stagingplays on Jewish themes. He contends &quot;Arab petrodollars&quot;subsidize anti-Semitic groups in the U.S.S.R.   Among Russian immigrants to Israel, the Israeli LaborParty leader, Shimon Peres, &quot;is absolutely unpopular,&quot; Mr.Kelbert says. &quot;Russians have experience of real socialism.They know its dishonest games. For someone from the West, myapproach seems a little bit hard and quite unattractive, butsomeone from my background has no illusions about the world,about Arabs. That's why we don't support Peres, who wouldsell this country for two extra American smiles.&quot;   Labor supporters aren't particularly worried about suchcomments, saying most of the new immigrants aren'tideologues. &quot;They're urban, middle-class people, many of whomwould probably have gone to America,&quot; says Shlomo Avineri, apolitical scientist at Hebrew University. A study a few yearsago showed that Soviet Jews who arrived with distinctlyrightist views had changed within two or three years tomirror the voting pattern of Israel as a whole. &quot;There's aprocess of socialization,&quot; Mr. Avineri says.   For now, however, many newcomers are expressing opinionsthat echo Mr. Kelbert's. &quot;This land wasn't a gift from anyone-- we've been through war to get it,&quot; says Alex Rabin, a24-year-old engineering student in Haifa who arrived a yearago. &quot;There are Arabs living in Haifa, so why can't I settleon the West Bank?&quot;   Kira Netdov, 36, and her brother Misha, 29, already have.The two decided to leave the Soviet Union about a year ago,and they arrived last month. &quot;We had no good informationabout Israel, not a single word,&quot; says Ms. Netdov. &quot;All weever saw on television was shootings, killings, West Bank,Gaza, Gaza, West Bank.&quot; Inclined to distrust the Sovietmedia, and hearing positive reports from returning tourists,the Netdovs came anyway.   Now, stirring cabbage in his bare apartment in the WestBank town of Ariel, where he and his sister joined some 60families newly arrived from the Soviet Union, Misha Netdovstumbles over an unfamiliar English word. &quot;Obstacles,&quot; chimesin Kira, whose English is better. &quot;We have learned from themedia that we are `obstacles to peace,'&quot; she says, quotingthe official U.S. view of Israeli settlements in the occupiedlands. &quot;But why?&quot; She gestures out the window to the stonyhillsides. &quot;There are empty mountains all around us here, andthis mountain was empty before the Jews came. Where are theArab houses, the villages that we are crowding out? Where isthe problem?&quot;   To Samir Qumsieh, a Palestinian deportee, the problem isall too clear. Mr. Qumsieh was 23 years old when he wasexpelled from the West Bank and forced to walk nine hoursacross the desert into Jordan. Now a successful businessmanin Kuwait, he hasn't seen his home in 18 years. In February,Mr. Qumsieh picked up a newspaper and found a picture of asmiling Soviet family, happily moving into their new WestBank apartment. &quot;Believe me, I felt real pain about it,&quot; saysMr. Qumsieh, who says he was deported after refusing toprovide information to Israeli security police. (Israeldeclines to comment on individual security cases.) &quot;Whyshould they be able to settle there when I am banned fromeven visiting the land of my birth?&quot;   Like most Palestinians, Mr. Qumsieh isn't much comfortedby the fact that, with the exception of suburbs built byIsraelis on annexed land in Arab East Jerusalem, few SovietJews are choosing to settle in the occupied territories.Although exact numbers aren't available, immigrationofficials estimate that only about 1% of the newcomers haveso far moved to the outlying settlements. Most haveaspirations for professional employment that can only besatisfied in large cities such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem andHaifa.   Though the immigrants bring a wealth of talent -- almost aquarter hold qualifications as engineers, scientists orprofessionals -- many have skills too highly specialized tofit easily into Israel's much smaller labor market. One newarrival, Simon Jakubovitch, has two qualifications: as amining engineer and an ice-hockey teacher. Neither skill islikely to be much use in Israel, which doesn't play icehockey and hasn't done much mining since King Solomon's day.   Jews are permitted to leave the Soviet Union with littlecash and few belongings. Israeli government subsidies andJewish-community donations pay allowances for food andhousing, and the government also provides mortgages. Butfinding the capital to start a business in Israel remainsextremely difficult.   Mr. Shiliar, the Leningrad immigrant learning the words ofhis first Passover, faces this problem. In the Soviet Union,he worked as a fencing instructor. He would like to giveIsraeli youngsters lessons in the foil and epee, &quot;but itcosts much money to start such a school,&quot; he says with asigh.   Leonid Kelbert's wife, Masha, a forensic biologist with 15years' experience, soon realized she wouldn't find work inher specialty -- analyzing traces of blood and tissue atcrime scenes. &quot;We had 24 forensic biologists just for thecity of Leningrad,&quot; she says. &quot;Here, there are only six forall of Israel.&quot; Finally, she found a job doing lab work inendocrinology. &quot;On March 15, they fired me,&quot; she said. &quot;It isa typical new-immigrant problem: Because I was the lasthired, when cutbacks came I was the first fired.&quot;   The Kelberts are determined to remain in Israel, whateverthe hardships, but many of their friends don't have the samecommitment. One, an academic and poet, is leaving with hisfamily for London to take up a position with the BritishBroadcasting Corp. In Israel he had to eke out his income asa building guard. Another friend, Yuri Vitenson, visiting theKelberts on the Jewish sabbath, is quick to ask an overseasguest about opportunities for musicians abroad. The51-year-old violinist was a professor at TashkentConservatory of Music. In Israel four months, he isdiscouraged about his prospects. Living at a center for newimmigrants some 30 miles out of Jerusalem, he also isbattling cultural isolation.   Housing the new immigrants is a challenge the Israeligovernment hasn't yet faced. Even though large numbers ofSoviet Jews began arriving a full year ago, by March thegovernment had yet to break ground on even one of its plannednew housing units. As a result, rents are soaring, with somelandlords asking tenants for increases of as much as 40%.   Such rises are an intolerable burden to many Israelisalready struggling on low incomes. And, not surprisingly,there is some discontent.   Raanana, a coastal town near Tel Aviv, has housed 200Soviet families, greeting newcomers at the airport, findingthem apartments and even providing a cake as a welcome totheir new home. But the mayor, Zeev Bielski, says some of thepoorer residents of the town complained, &quot;saying you givethem cake, you give them a fridge, what about us?&quot; So he hasstarted a program to channel funds to poorer residents aswell as to newcomers.   At the Technion in Haifa, Gad Eilam, the dean of students,wrestles with a similar quandary. As Israel's foremostscience and engineering school, the Technion expects to playa key role in fitting the huge numbers of technically skilledSoviets into the Israeli economy. But the institution needsfunds to build dormitories, add teaching positions and hirethe influx of gifted researchers. At the same time, the needsof native-born Israelis can't be neglected. &quot;When my son getsout of the army in three years I don't want to have to lookhim in the eye and say `Sorry, there's no place for youbecause we gave it to a Soviet immigrant,'&quot; says Mr. Eilam.   Despite all the difficulties, many Soviets are findinggreat pleasures in their new home. While an Israelidepartment store isn't Bloomingdale's, it is a far cry fromthe ill-stocked drabness of Soviet shopping. Anna Gurevich, a23-year-old student, is both delighted and baffled by all theconsumer choices. &quot;All these banks,&quot; she says, bemusedlylisting them: &quot;Bank Hapoalim, Discount Bank, Bank Leumi --how does anyone ever decide on one?&quot;   Many newcomers also are finding pleasure in exploringtheir religious heritage. &quot;The word `Jew' is like `pig' toRussian ears -- they try not to pronounce it,&quot; says MikailTuvin, a 33-year-old organic chemist. He grew up in Moscowknowing nothing about his faith except that Jews &quot;cut thepenises of their boys and in spring they bake matzoh&quot; --unleavened bread. Since coming to Israel, Mr. Tuvin hasstudied in a yeshiva, or religious seminary.   Like most Russian Jews, Mr. Tuvin wasn't circumcised as aninfant, as Jewish tradition demands. He had the operationbefore he left Moscow, performed in the kitchen of a friend'sapartment by a heart surgeon who wore both a surgical gownand a Jewish prayer garment.   So many adult Soviets are asking to be circumcised thatone Jerusalem hospital performed 13 circumcisions on adultsand young boys on a recent day, as surgeons from all overIsrael gathered to learn the procedure. Religious specialistscircumcise infants, but the operation for adults is morecomplicated, requiring a local anesthetic and stitches.   For the newest arrivals, though, realities of adjusting tothe new life are lost in the joys of first setting foot onIsraeli soil. At Lod airport, in the pre-dawn gloom, anotherload of immigrants is arriving. Fifty-three-year-old EthelArakian steps from the plane and, weighed down by severalbags of belongings, makes her way through the crowd. &quot;Iwanted to come here to be with all the Jews -- I feel likekissing the ground,&quot; she says, her broad smile revealing arow of gold-capped teeth. Two sons and a daughter already arein Israel; two more hope to make the trip. &quot;Russia,&quot; shesays, &quot;will soon be empty.&quot;   ---                The Demographics of Change                                                                                                               Increased Emigration from the Soviet Union             Will Affect Israel's Composition                                                                                                          Israel's 1988 population of 4.4 million people, by countryof origin and religious background, in percent                                                                                                          Other European Jews                      17.9%   African Jews                             17.7   Native born Jews                         17.5   Asian Jews                               16.8   Moslem                                   14.2   Soviet Jews                               6.5   North and South American Jews             5.3   Christian                                 2.3   Druse and Other                           1.8                                                                                                          Sources: Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, Israel CentralBureau of Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
