Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LUVEARNINGS (ERN)AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southwest Airlines reported net income plunged 96% in the second quarter, indicating its problems aren't limited to its unprofitable TranStar Airlines unit.    Southwest's net income fell to $635,000, or two cents a share, from $17.1 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter's profit reflects a pretax gain of $4.3 million from the sale and lease-back of aircraft. Revenue rose 5.9% to $205.3 million from $193.9 million.    The company cited continuing losses at TranStar, which has been a drain on Southwest's earnings since the fourth quarter of last year. As previously reported, Southwest will ground TranStar after its flights Sunday and begin liquidating its assets, including 18 aircraft, airport gates and ground handling equipment.    But TranStar wasn't the only problem. Several analysts said they were surprised by the poor performance of Southwest's main Southwest Airlines unit in the quarter.    Excluding TranStar's loss, Southwest's pretax profit in the quarter still fell 54% to $9.2 million from $20 million. And without the gain from the sale and lease-back, Southwest's pretax profit, excluding TranStar, would have dropped an even steeper 76%.    The biggest factor was lower fares. Because of discounts, Southwest's and TranStar's yields, or average fare per mile, both fell about 14% from a year earlier. That represents a much sharper drop than in the industry as a whole. For example, American Airlines, a major competitor of Southwest, saw its yields increase 4% during the quarter. American is a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp.    Southwest said the low fares were necessary to win back traffic lost in the first quarter after the company didn't match the industry's popular MaxSaver fares. Southwest introduced its own version of the MaxSaver, called Fun Fares Too, in April and traffic picked up sharply after that.    &quot;The MaxSaver fares stripped us of a lot of traffic,&quot; Herbert D. Kelleher, chairman and president of Southwest, said in an interview. &quot;The second quarter was just the beginning of the recovery process.&quot;    He also said the carrier has been hurt by the weak economy in the oil patch. But Mr. Kelleher said Southwest's fare -- permile levels improved in July and he predicted a &quot;very strong&quot; third quarter.    Southwest shares closed Friday at $22, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    For the first half, Southwest posted a net loss of $9.2 million, after the gain from the sale and lease-back. A year earlier, Southwest earned $19.8 million, or 61 cents a share. Revenue for the six months rose 4.5% to $383.7 million from $367.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
