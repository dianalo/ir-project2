The boost, effective today was ordered to ensure the continued availability of mortgage funds to veterans by bringing the rate closer in line with the private mortgage market, officials said.    The agency last changed its rate on May 11, raising it to 10% from 9.5%. A month earlier, in the first increase in more than two years, the agency raised the rate to 9.5% from 8.5%. The latest increase raises the monthly payment on an average $70,000, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage from $614 to $640.    A spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association praised the VA for responding quickly to market conditions; the increase was announced the same day the Federal Reserve boosted its discount rate to 6% from 5.5%.    &quot;We think the VA was exceedingly responsive,&quot; said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association. &quot;Their role is to track the market and they've done so.&quot; Nevertheless, Mr. Lasko called the overall rise in interest rates &quot;unfortunate,&quot; adding, &quot;These higher rates are going to hurt the housing industry.&quot;    Separately, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.63% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, up from 10.33% the previous week and significantly higher than the 9.90% rate of a year earlier.    Analysts linked the rise to a similar increase in interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds. More broadly, said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, &quot;We're no longer in a declining interest rate environment, as we've been in for several years. . . . It appears we're in a period where rates could as well go up or down.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
