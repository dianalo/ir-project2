Industrysources estimated that the accord could be valued at $2billion.   Separately, Airbus declined to confirm a report in the NewYork Times that it will receive a firm order for 25 freighterversions of its A300 twin-jet from Federal Express Corp. Aspokesman for the consortium said in Paris that it would makean announcement today, and that Airbus has been innegotiations with the Memphis, Tenn., express carrier. &quot;Acontract hasn't yet been signed, but I can tell you thatFederal Express is interested in Airbus aircraft,&quot; thespokesman said.                                                                                                          Federal Express said although it is engaged innegotiations with Airbus concerning a possible purchase ofA300-600 aircraft, no agreement has been reached. In astatement, Frederick W. Smith, chief executive officer ofFederal Express, said a purchase of the A300s wouldsupplement the company's narrow-body Boeing 727 fleet by theend of the decade. He stressed that there has been nocompetititon between McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus forthis portion of the company's fleet because the Airbuseswould have a different mission in the company. He said thecompany is continuing to acquire McDonnell Douglas wide-bodyaircraft.   Kenneth R. Masterson, senior vice president and generalcounsel of Federal Express, said the company already haspurchased one McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 and has a firm contractto buy 12 others plus an option for 11 more. Mr. Mastersonsaid a transaction with Airbus &quot;would have no bearing on theMD-11 options, which are primarily for international use.&quot;   The Airbus letter of intent with Kuwait Airways coversfirm orders for three A320 short-to-medium range aircraft,three A310-300s, five wide-bodied A300-600Rs and fourA340-200s. The carrier also has also taken out options fortwo A321s, three A300-600Rs and four A340-200s.   The order will help Kuwait to rebuild its airline, whichwas severely hurt by the Persian Gulf War. Kuwait AirwaysPresident Ahmed Al-Mishari said his airline lost 15 aircraftduring the hostilities.   Kuwait Airways will start receiving its A320s andA310-300s in 1992 and deliveries of other aircraft willfollow. The A340s, which are still in the development stage,will be delivered starting in 1997.   Jean Pierson, Airbus managing director, said the Kuwaitiorder marks the first time that the consortium has received asingle order for all of its aircraft types.   The engines for the A320s and A340s will come from CFMInternational, a joint venture of General Electric Co. of theU.S. and Snecma of France. The other aircraft will be poweredby GE engines.   Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain and Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Germany's Daimler-BenzAG.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
