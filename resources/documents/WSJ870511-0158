It is unfortunate GM does not look across the ocean at its Adam Opel subsidiary. That company offers its European customers small, mid-size and large cars that are several cuts above what GM produces for the North American market. If you were to drive your Cadillac de Ville to JFK, fly to Frankfurt and rent Opel's equivalent of the Cadillac, the Senator, you would find it to be light-years ahead of the Cadillac in comfort, performance and general engineering. You get four-wheel disc brakes and independent rear suspension instead of opera lights and fake convertible tops. A smaller mid-size Opel, the Omega, was recently voted European Car of the Year. The factory cannot keep up with orders. Dealers have waiting lists.    Nobody seems to talk about the sad fact that European customers demand more and get more. U.S. and Canadian customers get second best. GM might come out of its current predicament quite fast, if it offered in Columbus the same well-engineered, high-content automobiles that it sells in Cologne.
