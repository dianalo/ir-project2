Such an interface wasimplemented at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Design issuesand decisions that preceded software development are discussed, followedby details of software operation. Development experiences that wouldbe applicable to a similar effort are described. 20 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
