Joy, which plans to go private in a leveraged buyout valued at $620 million, had said it would likely sell the business in an effort to reduce debt. The sale will be completed when Joy Acquisition Corp., the company formed to make the leveraged buyout, takes control of Joy Manufacturing, a maker of coal mining and petroleum equipment.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
