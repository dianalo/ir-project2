They have the nextvalues at n equalling 1, 2, 3, 4: +2.70+-0.30; -0.26+-0.09; -3.70+-0.20;-6.10+-0.20 for HOIn phthalocyanine substituted correspondingly. Effectof the methane atom nature on the basicity of phthalocyanine nitrogenmesonic atoms is considered. Using the conductometry method, it is establishedthat phthalocyanines in concentrated H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ form both completelyprotonated shapes and contact ion pairs.</TEXT></DOC>
