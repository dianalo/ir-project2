And they have another thing in common: the same bank. Butit isn't one of the industry giants that are jockeying to bein position for national banking. It is KeyCorp, of Albany,N.Y.</LP><TEXT>   Though only midsized and not a money-center bank, KeyCorphas been a leader in taking advantage of shifting interstatebanking laws, quietly assembling one of the more far-flungempires in the business. Already it operates 623 branches ineight states along the nation's northern tier.   And it will soon have more. The Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. is expected shortly to name Key and a joint bidder totake over Goldome, a capital-starved savings bank based inBuffalo, N.Y., that has $9.9 billion in assets.   KeyCorp's broad reach gives it an edge over most otherregional banks. A handful of others have extensive interstateholdings, such as First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, in14 Western states from Alaska to Texas and BankAmerica Corp.with banks in eight states Washington to New Mexico. But theyare more confined geographically; no other U.S. bank has theregional diversity of KeyCorp.   The advantages are evident. When the Northwest was inrecession a few years ago, the Northeast was booming. Now,with New York and New England in a slump, Key banks inWashington, Oregon and elsewhere shore up profit. &quot;Problemsin one or two states can be contained,&quot; says H. DouglasBarclay, a KeyCorp director. &quot;Over time it all balances out.&quot;   That's exactly the effect regulators have in mind as theylobby Congress to allow banks more freedom to expand beyondexisting state and regional barriers. Doing so, by overridingthe remaining patchwork of state restrictions, would makebanks less vulnerable to regional shocks, argues RobertClarke, comptroller of the currency. A bill to let banks openbranches nationwide three years from now has a good chance ofpassing Congress this session.   KeyCorp has grown by serving small towns, a roster ofrural America from Sweet Home, Ore., and Gig Harbor, Wash.,to East Setauket, N.Y., and Mexico, Maine. Its marketpresence is strong only in sparsely populated states likeWyoming and Maine. It serves only a few big cities, where itranks third in the market at best. Some KeyCorp branches holddeposits of less than $12 million, about the minimumpractical size.   KeyCorp's strength in rural America has led some financialanalysts to speak of it as &quot;the Wal-Mart of banking,&quot; acomparison that doesn't bother KeyCorp. One banker there sumsup his &quot;Sam Walton strategy&quot; for taking on larger rivals:&quot;Hit 'em where they ain't.&quot;   Swelled by acquisition, KeyCorp's assets have grownsevenfold over the past decade to $19.3 billion, ranking itNo. 36 in the country. Last year -- not a pleasant one formany banks -- KeyCorp turned in an 8.4% earnings gain.Charge-offs were only 0.7% of total loans, about half theaverage for regional banks. The benchmark equity-to-assetratio stands at a robust 6.39%. KeyCorp stock has aboutdoubled since late last year, and yesterday closed up $1.25at $34.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading.   Still, doing business over a broad area has its drawbacks.Though protected during regional downturns, Key also can'tbenefit as richly as local banks when an area turns up. ToKeyCorp Chairman and Chief Executive Victor Riley Jr., thetrade-off is a good bargain. &quot;When you aren't held captive toa single region, you can build a steadier business,&quot; heexplains. &quot;It wasn't so long ago that Bank of Boston was theRock of Gibraltar.&quot;   Geographic range also makes a bank expensive to run. Key'soperating costs as a percentage of assets are relativelyhigh. Some executives log hundreds of thousands of miles eachyear staying abreast of things.   No one puts in more time on the road than Mr. Riley, thelongest-reigning chief executive (18 years) of any of thenation's top 50 banks. He often spends three or four days aweek on the corporate jet, touching down in tiny airfields tospend time with bank managers and address local groups.   &quot;Let the money-center banks float Eurobonds and buildbuildings in Hong Kong,&quot; he says over the whine of the littlejet, winging to yet another KeyCorp town. He gestures out thewindow to the quilted farmland below. &quot;Middle America willalways need a place to bank.&quot;   On the ground, he greets a lending officer who spends muchof his time keeping potato farmers afloat during longnorthern Maine winters. &quot;He's a dedicated community banker,one of our best,&quot; Mr. Riley says of the man later. &quot;InManhattan, they'd probably eat him alive.&quot;   Mr. Riley didn't fare well on Wall Street either, when hebegan reaching beyond his upstate New York base in 1985 tobuy banks in the Northwest. Few securities analysts thoughtthey could be effectively managed. Today, they've changedtheir tune. &quot;Vic Riley has been able to accomplish by longdistance more than most bankers can manage from down thestreet,&quot; says J. Richard Fredericks, of Montgomery SecuritiesInc.   KeyCorp probably paid too much for the first of its Alaskaacquisitions in 1985, says Mr. Barclay, the director, amistake that became painful when the state's oil economystalled. But Alaska gave KeyCorp a foothold in the Northwestand set a new direction for the bank. As the Northwest'seconomy deteriorated, Key snapped up weak banks cheaply.   Now, with its Northwest banks on solid ground, and armedwith capital from a $123 million secondary stock offering,Key is again turning to the Northeast. There it hopes toexpand further in a round of federally assisted takeovers.   Thanks to its success thus far in resuscitating weakbanks, KeyCorp enjoys a good reputation with regulators,analysts say, and picked up more than $2 billion in bankingassets seized by regulators last year. Assuming it completesthe Goldome takeover, it would boost its assets more than20%, after shrinking the profitable but capital-short savingsbank and dividing the spoils with joint bidder First EmpireState Corp. of Buffalo. KeyCorp's next target is probably NewHampshire, where analysts say it is eyeing ailing AmoskeagBank Shares Inc., a $1.5 billion Manchester-based bank, andothers. KeyCorp doesn't discourage that speculation.   KeyCorp's lending philosophy is as small-town as itsbranch roster. It has no foreign loans, no highly leveragedtransactions, and a $25 million cap on loans to a singlecreditor. Small-business loans, home mortgages and consumerlending predominate, while real estate construction loans arejust 3.6% of the total.   Sometimes, Key's conservatism costs it deals. CharlesJones, a mail-plane pilot who runs a growing air taxibusiness in Rockland, Maine, gave up trying to switch hiscredit line to Key. &quot;In my business, you need to be ready tomove on a dime, to grab new opportunities as they comealong,&quot; he says. &quot;Key Bank couldn't keep up. They wanted toomany guarantees.&quot;   Mr. Riley knows he sometimes misses out. &quot;But our businessexpertise is part of what we offer to borrowers,&quot; he says.&quot;And if we don't understand a particular business, weshouldn't be lending money.&quot;   KeyCorp's acquisitions of scores of small banks raisedifficult issues of market concentration that willincreasingly come to the fore as consolidation sweeps thebanking landscape. In Maine, state and federal regulatorsalready are worried about the effect in some markets ofFleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.'s buy-out of the failedBank of New England. So are KeyCorp executives, but they findthemselves in the odd position of arguing with regulators onbehalf of Fleet, their largest rival, that such consolidationis healthy and even necessary if banking is to pull out ofits slump.   KeyCorp itself could be a candidate for merger in a fewyears, analysts say. Mr. Riley says he isn't talking withanyone now and hasn't in the past. But he makes clear thatwhat he calls &quot;a merger of equals&quot; with a Midwest or evenCanadian bank might make sense to fill in big gaps betweenKeyCorp's markets.   Mr. Riley has made some progress consolidating currentholdings and centralizing functions such as back-officecomputer systems, securities analysts say. But the59-year-old chief executive insists that day-to-day decisionmaking remain decentralized to preserve the retail franchiseand identity of a small-town bank after it is acquired. Mostlocal managers are given wide latitude on lending decisions.&quot;Customers can sense whether they're talking to adecision-maker or a messenger,&quot; he says.   In Rockland, Maine, local businessmen bear out Mr. Riley'sclaim. When the town's annual Lobster Festival was infinancial trouble recently, Key contributed $3,000, whileother out-of-state banks didn't help at all, says EdKolmosky, Rockland's Cadillac dealer. The Key bank's manager&quot;grew up here, and he's active in the Rotary and in thecommunity. He's not just passing through.&quot;   That kind of homespun management makes a difference insmall towns like Vinalhaven, where the tiny red-brick bankthat's now KeyCorp's branch has stood on Main Street since1929. With ornate interior woodwork and leaded glass, itlooks little different than it did when it opened in a timewhen granite fueled the local economy and stones were shippedby the millions to pave the streets of New York.   Today, the economy centers on the island's small lobsterfleet and its summer visitors, who double Vinalhaven'syear-round population of 1,300 for a few weeks. But even inwinter, manager Drucilla Day Beal doesn't have time to watchthe seals that visit Carver's Pond next to the bank. Inaddition to writing loans and tracking the bank's $14 millionof deposits, she shovels snow from the walk and even has toplunge the plumbing from time to time.   Ms. Beal also oversees a little folksy marketing, with ahand from her tellers and her husband. In the town Fourth ofJuly parade down Main Street last year, the bank fielded afloat featuring an eight-foot papier-mache Tyrannosaurus Rex-- the DinoSaver.   Ms. Beal seems to know everyone on the island. DepositorIvan Calderwood started saving at the bank when he was astonecutter earning $2.50 a day. Now he's 91 and a bit hardof hearing, so Ms. Beal shouts when she says hello. At alocal sandwich shop, a mother cradling her baby asks when shecan stop by to sign some papers, and lobsterman PeterMcDonald hails her with &quot;Hey there, Drucilla, how's myaccount holding out?&quot;   &quot;Fishing is a little like farming,&quot; Mr. McDonald tells astranger. &quot;You make money in the fall, and hand it back tothe bank in winter. If you get lucky, you might just end upwith a little bit left over.&quot;   But lobstering has been hard lately, and Ms. Beal'soverdue list is longer than usual. &quot;People come to see me,and they fret and shift back and forth in the chair next tomy desk, and sometimes we have to work out new payments,&quot; shesays. &quot;I know it's risky lending to lobstermen, especiallythe young guys who are just getting started. But these arekids whose father and grandfather before them got financingfrom us,&quot; she says. &quot;They work hard. They'll be able to catchup.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
