(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It may seem as if a new set of goldenarches is springing up every day, but the McDonald's fast-foodrestaurant that opened for business Wednesday was special. It wasNo. 10,000.   The corporation known for reciting numbers as if they hadmystical properties _ more than 65 billion hamburgers served _dispatched about 20,000 balloons skyward at the opening in DaleCity and another 10,000 exactly at the Convention Center inWashington, where it was holding its biannual convention forfranchisees and partners, said Richard G. Starmann, senior vicepresident.   ``It's almost 33 years to the day when Ray Kroc opened his firstMcDonald's,'' said the corporation's president and chief executiveofficer, Mike Quinlan. ``If Ray were here, he would be fiercelyproud of the McDonald's family.''   The fast-food chain branched into Eastern Europe on March 24when it opened a restaurant in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia,and plans to open another one in Budapest in May. Hungary will thusbecome the 50th country around the world to have a McDonald's.   Of the 10,000 restaurants, 75 percent are locally operated byindependent entrepreneurs. Others are joint-venture partnershipsand some wholly owned subsidiaries, Starmann said.   Kroc opened the first McDonald's restaurant on April 15, 1955,in Des Plaines, Ill. Sales on that rainy day, according to astatement from the company, were $366.12.   Last year, McDonald's worldwide sales were $14.3 billion and itserved 22 million customers in 49 countries. It passed the mark of60 billion hamburgers served in November 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
