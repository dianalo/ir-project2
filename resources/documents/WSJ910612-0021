At a meeting here this week, the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners drafted the model rule, which stateregulators could choose to adopt. Ten states already havesimilar regulations, and three more have legislation pending.</LP><TEXT>   The rule would limit future purchases of junk bonds, butit is unclear whether it would require insurers who currentlyhold more than 20% to get rid of some of their high-yield,high-risk securities.   The rule is a &quot;reflection of the concern of stateinsurance regulators that changes in economic and marketconditions could adversely affect insurers with highconcentrations of less than investment-grade bonds,&quot; aspokesman said. Regulators recently seized the life insuranceunits of First Executive Corp. and First Capital Corp., whichhave large junk-bond holdings.   The model rule would limit investments in a single issueto 1% of assets for bonds rated double-B and 0.5% of assetsfor bonds rated below double-B. If an insurer held junk bondsin one company of more than 2% of the insurer's assets, itsdirectors would be required to monitor the investment.</TEXT></DOC>
