WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cabinet nominee Jack Kemp told Congress onFriday that easing the ``appalling problem'' of homelessness wouldbe his highest priority as secretary of housing and urbandevelopment.   Kemp's Senate confirmation hearing was filled with bipartisanpraise for the secretary-designate but was interrupted by a briefprotest demonstration by housing activists.   Kemp, a former congressman from New York and a 1988 Republicanpresidential candidate, pledged to be an advocate for increasedfederal efforts on housing for the poor.   He avoided committing himself on most specific spendingquestions, but said the Bush administration would revise formerPresident Reagan's proposal for the Housing and Urban DevelopmentDepartment's spending in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.   He promised to seek full funding of legislation passed byCongress to provide emergency shelter for the homeless, called theMcKinney Act, and said he favored expanding it in some areas.   ``I acknowledge that it is a very severe problem _ it is anappalling problem,'' Kemp said of homelessness.   ``It is an emergency problem, and I'm willing to treat it as thehighest priority, immediately, of my new leadership at HUD,'' Kempsaid.   Kemp said he visited privately with leaders of Miami's riot-tornOvertown and Liberty City areas last weekend when in that city forthe Super Bowl. He said, if confirmed, he planned to visit blightedinner cities and to visit homeless people in New York City andelsewhere.   The Senate banking committee took no vote on Kemp's nomination,but no opposition was voiced on the panel and he is expected to winconfirmation easily. A committee vote may come next week, after Kempanswers additional written questions.   His appearance was interrupted briefly by six demonstrators fromthe Community for Creative Non-Violence, a Washington advocate forthe homeless. Two stood up holding a large sign saying ``HousingNow,'' while they and others shouted and turned on a noisemakingmachine.   ``There are people sleeping on the streets right now and you aredirectly responsible for it,'' one woman shouted.   The four women and two men were taken from the hearing room byCapitol police and security personnel. They were arrested andcharged with disrupting a committee of the Congress anddemonstrating within a Capitol building, charges that carry amaximum $500 fine and six-month jail term.   ``I wish they'd stayed and heard my remarks,'' Kemp said of theprotesters.   Kemp is a conservative Republican who has allied himself withliberal Democrats on some urban issues, but also voted against majorhousing legislation as a member of Congress. He said he said hewould ``transcend all ideological differences'' to look for ways tohelp deal with urban problems.   Asked by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., the committee chairman, howhe could improve housing and other problems within the constraintsof the federal budget deficit, Kemp said, ``There's going to be somegive and take ... I am willing where necessary to fight for the fullfunding, or to fight for increased funding, or to fight forreordering priorities.''   Kemp said he would pursue programs aimed at allowingpublic-housing residents to buy their homes and would push forenactment of tax incentives for urban enterprise zones, to encouragejob-creating businesses in distressed areas.   ``We need to unleash the power of free enterprise in our innercities,'' he said.   He repeated his support for expanded use of federal vouchers,which provide rental subsidies directly to low-income families. Buthe acknowledged the nation faces a problem with a shortage inavailable affordable housing for low and moderate income people, andsaid his goal would be to encourage tenant ownership withoutdepleting the affordable subsidized housing stock.   Housing programs have been among the hardest-hit federal programsby budget cuts of the Reagan administration years, with spending forhousing subsidies cut by more than 80 percent over eight years.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called rising homelessness ``themost troublesome legacy of the Reagan administration.'' Riegle saidthe lack of housing, and other urban problems, contribute to a lackof hope and ``the beginnings of a kind of civil anarchy'' in cities.   Reflecting the bipartisan support for Kemp, Cranston praisedKemp's appointment and said ``you have the energy and abilities thatare sorely needed to bring new life to a department that has beenseverely weakened in recent years.''</TEXT></DOC>
