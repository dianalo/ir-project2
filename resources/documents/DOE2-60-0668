The computation of reinforcementwas designed and constructed in a unique way based on the investigationof existing methods. Whereas no reinforcement is used around the barrel/casingquite differently from conventional reinforcement, the barrel concreteis reinforced with spiral bars at 45{sup 0} and 135{sup 0} from the directionof main stress, as compared with conventional vertical and horizontalreinforcement in cylindrical form. The concrete placing is greatly facilitatedas no reinforcement is present around the casing, resulting in high qualitywork. As the design was different from conventional technique, measuringinstruments were buried to measure stresses, which gave values in goodagreement with calculation. The power station has been operated successfully.(15 figs, 3 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
