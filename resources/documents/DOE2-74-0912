The first problem which comes to mind is the transparency of theatmosphere. Tests in situ were carried out in the coal mine Aumance (FrenchCollieries) at Buxieres-les-Mines (Allier), where a continuous minerJeffrey 120 RH is at work. Transmittance was investigated in the presenceof visible and infrared radiation. The work had three objectives theproof of the presence of ore in relation to the barren rock for the purposeof improving selectivity; the automation of ground breaking machines(shearers, road headers or continuous miners) through the developmentof perceptive capacities for the purpose of their exact location at anytime in relation to the face; and the safety of persons underground bytheir detection in any risky zones. The results of the tests in situand the processing of the pictures in the laboratory are described. 15refs., 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
