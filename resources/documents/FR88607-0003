This revision waspublished for comment on April 23, 1987. (52 FR 13458). The revised regulationincludes: (1) A description of the Board's procedures in processing requestsunder the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''); (2) further delegationof authority to the Board's General Counsel to act on requests for informationby law enforcement agencies and others; (3) additional provisions regardingthe availability of information to federal and state financial institutions'supervisory authorities; (4) disclosure by financial institutions of examinationor inspection reports to certified public accountants and attorneys employedby such institutions; and (5) notice of FOIA requests to submitters ofconfidential commercial or financial information, and procedures for requestingconfidential treatment of such information and requests for disclosureof such information.On April 22, 1987, the Board adopted as a final rule changes to its feeschedules pertaining to requests for Board documents pursuant to the Freedomof Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570. 52 FR 15299 (April 28,1987). Accordingly, those changes to that section (andSection; 261.10) werenot addressed in this rulemaking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Stephen L.

The revisionalso changes certain procedures for obtaining access to documents. Theseprovisions and changes were described in detail when comments were requestedon the proposal. See 52 FR 15299 (April 23, 1987). The Board received twelvecomment letters_five from Reserve Banks, two from commercial banks, fourfrom trade associations and one from a Congressman. Of these twelve comments,seven generally supported the proposed revisions. There were no commentsopposed to the proposed revisions, but one of the seven generally supportivecomments and four of the remaining five comments recommended substantivechanges, which have been considered by the Board. The remaining commentand part of another comment recommending substantive changes addressedissues not applicable to the proposal. Changes to the rule in responseto the comments are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">A. Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG>Minor wording changes were made, but no substantive changes were made tothis subpart of the proposed regulation.<ITAG tagnum="85">B. Subpart B_Published Information and Records Available to Public;Procedures for Requests</ITAG>Minor changes were made to this subpart as a result of comments made, andcertain clarifications are noted.Section 261.6(b)(5) was amended to clarify that notices received pursuantto the Change in Bank Control Act, as well as applications received pursuantto the Bank Holding Company Act, are reviewed upon receipt for separationinto a public portion and a confidential portion. The public portions ofthese applications and notices may be released either by the Board or theappropriate Federal Reserve Bank without further review, and any requestfor an application or notice will be deemed to be a request for the publicportions only, unless otherwise specifically noted.The Board wishes to clarify a statement in andSection; 261.8(a)(3), whichis the exemption from disclosure for trade secrets, and confidential commercialor financial information. Section 261.8(a)(3)(ii) states that the Boardmay, without prior notice and to the extent it deems necessary, commenton such information in any opinion or statement issued to the public inconnection with a Board action to which such information pertains. Thisprovision is included in the regulation to ensure that the Board has theability to fully discuss the basis for its actions on regulatory applications.\1\<NOTE/> However, the Board's staff normally will apprise an applicantin the course of the application's process that such information may needto be disclosed in connection with the Board's action on the application.This would afford the applicant the opportunity either to revise the applicationor to withdraw the application prior to Board action or to address thematter further with Board staff.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As a related matter, the procedure established in andSection;261.17, regarding notice of a request for information to submitters ofconfidential information, does not apply to any determination by the Boardto comment upon such information in any opinion or statement concerninga regulatory application. (See andSection; 261.17(g)).Section 261.10 was adopted as a final rule in a separate action due toa statutory deadline for adoption of revised fee schedules. 52 FR 15299(April 28, 1987). When the entire Part 261 was published for comment, andSection;261.10 was included in its proposed format for the convenience of the public,with the statement that the comment procedure for that section was a separateaction and the comment period had already closed. Nevertheless, one commentwas received regarding the fees, but it did not raise any new issues notalready addressed by the Board when the fee schedule was adopted in finalform. Section 261.10 was adopted in its final form by the Board on April22, 1987, (52 FR 15299, April 28, 1987) and is included in this rulemakingfor the sake of clarity and convenience.<ITAG tagnum="85">C. Subpart C_Confidential Information Made Available to SupervisedInstitutions, Financial Institutions Supervisory Agencies, Law EnforcementAgencies, and Other in Certain Circumstances</ITAG>Both major and minor changes were made to this subpart as a result of publiccomments received by the Board. In addition, certain clarifications arenoted.Section 261.11(a) was amended by deleting the last sentence of this paragraphas unnecessary in light of new andSection; 261.11(b). The rest of andSection;261.11 has been clarified through reorganization and modification. Section261.11(b) was renumbered as andSection; 261.11(e) and simplified, and andSection;261.13(d) has been renumbered as andSection; 261.11(b).This new andSection; 261.11(b), which concerns disclosure of confidentialsupervisory information by a supervised financial institution, logicallyshould follow andSection; 261.11(a), which concerns disclosure of confidentialsupervisory information to the supervised financial institution. The Board received several comments on andSection; 261.13(d) as proposed.These comments stated that proposed andSection; 261.13(d) could be read toprohibit disclosure of confidential supervisory information to parent holdingcompanies, officers, directors, and employees; that the requirement thatthe supervised financial institution agree to keep any confidential informationprovided to it confidential was unnecessary; that the requirement thatthe supervised financial institution consult with the appropriate ReserveBank prior to disclosing confidential institutions to ``agents'' was awkward,unnecessary, and may prevent the necessary flow of information to ``agents'';and that the Board should require financial institutions to make Boardreports of examination available to their outside auditors. In response to the comments, the Board amended andSection; 261.13(d) (thenew andSection; 261.11(b)) to clarify that a supervised financial institutionand its parent bank holding company may disclose confidential supervisoryinformation to their officers, directors, and employees. The Board alsoeliminated the requirement that supervised financial institutions consultwith a Reserve Bank prior to disclosing confidential information to ``agents.''The new andSection; 261.11(b)(2) authorizes a supervised financial institutionto disclose confidential supervisory information to outside legal counseland outside auditors without consultation, subject to the following conditions,which apply to all persons and are set forth in andSection; 261.11(g): Thatthe confidential supervisory information be reviewed only on the premisesof the supervised financial institution; that no copies of the confidentialsupervisory information be made; and that such persons not disclose theconfidential supervisory information without the prior written approvalof the Board's General Counsel.The Board believes that it is unnecessary to make it mandatory that confidentialsupervisory information be provided to outside auditors. The American Instituteof Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA'') guidelines do not call foroutside auditor access to reports of examination in all situations in whichauditors may be retained to perform services for a bank, and bank managementwill have no practical alternative to permitting such access where it isneeded and authorized.The Board believes that outside auditors should receive access to its reportswhenever they are called upon to conduct a general audit or otherwise torender a formal opinion regarding a bank's condition. The Board notes thatoutside auditors are sometimes retained to assist in preparation of so-calleddirectors examinations. The Board believes that a bank's directors maypermit outside auditors to review reports of examination where appropriatein such situations, but that such review by the auditors does not absolvethe directors of their independent responsibility to read, understand,and respond appropriately to the Board's reports of examination, or ofany responsibility they may have under applicable law regarding the directors'examination.Section 261.11(e) was renumbered as andSection; 261.11(g), and andSection;261.11(g) was simplified and renumbered as andSection; 261.11(f).Section 261.11(f) was renumbered as andSection;andSection; 261.11(h)(1), and261.8(d) was renumbered as andSection; 261.11(h)(2). Section 261.11(h)(2),which concerns disclosure of confidential Report of Operations of a foreignbanking organization (Form F.R. 2068) by Federal Reserve employees, shouldlogically follow new andSection; 261.11(h)(1), which concerns disclosureof Form F.R. 2068 reports to other bank supervisory authorities.Section 261.12(e) was eliminated as unnecessary in light of new andSection;261.11(e), and andSection; 261.12 (f) through (h) were renumbered as andSection;andSection;261.12 (e) through (f).For purposes of clarity, andSection; 261.13(a) was amended. It originallyprovided that confidential supervisory information should not be disclosed``except in the most compelling circumstances.'' The term ``compellingcircumstances'', which is a term of art, may be confusing to the layman.Accordingly, andSection; 261.13(a) was revised to provide that the Boardwill not authorize disclosure of confidential supervisory information unlessthe person requesting disclosure ``is able to show a substantial need forsuch information that outweighs the need to maintain confidentiality.''The last sentence of the original andSection; 261.13(a) was eliminated asunnecessary.Section 261.13(b) was amended for clarity and for structural reasons. Itno longer applies only to requests for disclosure of confidential supervisoryinformation from private litigants, but has been expanded to include allrequests for access to confidential supervisory information not otherwisecovered by Subpart C or other portions of the regulation.Section 261.13(b)(1) was amended to combine the original andSection; 261.13(b)(1),which required litigants seeking documents to file a request, and originalandSection; 261.13(c), which required litigants seeking testimony to filea request. This amendment was made to simplify the regulation since bothsections required litigants to follow the same procedures. Section 261.13(b)(1)was further amended by setting forth the information that a litigant mustprovide to the Board to justify disclosure of confidential information.This amendment was made to explain how litigants and others can make ashowing of substantial need for the information that outweighs the needto maintain confidentiality required by andSection; 261.13(c)(1)(i).A new andSection; 261.13(b)(2) was added. This section was drafted in responseto comments received concerning proposed andSection; 261.13(d)(3), whichrequired financial institutions in possession of confidential supervisoryinformation to consult with the appropriate Reserve Bank prior to disclosingsuch information to agents in their employ. While the Board has amendedthat provision to automatically allow financial institutions to discloseconfidential supervisory information to outside legal counsel and outsideauditors, the Board believes that there are a number of other types ofagents to which the financial institutions may wish to disclose confidentialsupervisory information from time to time. The new andSection; 261.13(b)(2)permits financial institutions and others to make such requests for disclosureof confidential supervisory information to the Board. The Board will considersuch requests on a case by case basis.Original andSection; 261.13(b)(2) was renumbered as andSection; 261.13(c) (1)and (2) and amended. The proposed andSection; 261.13(b)(2) authorized theGeneral Counsel to approve requests for disclosure of confidential supervisoryinformation if the requester made a showing of ``compelling circumstancesthat require disclosure * * *'' and if the General Counsel determines thatsuch disclosure is consistent with the regulatory responsibilities andthe policies of the Board. The term ``compelling circumstances'' is a termof art that may be confusing to the layman. Accordingly, that provisionwas amended to read ``has shown a substantial need for confidential supervisoryinformation that outweighs the need to maintain confidentiality * * *.''A new andSection; 261.13(d) was added. Section 261.13(b)(1) was originallytitled ``Exhaustion of administrative remedies.'' It did not state withsufficient clarity that it was necessary to file a request under andSection;andSection;261.13(b)(1) and 261.13(c) to exhaust administrative remedies for discoverypurpose in any litigation, although this requirement was intended. Accordingly,andSection; 261.13(d) makes clear that action under andSection;261.13(c) exhaustsadministrative remedies for discovery purposes in any litigation. Section261.13(d) also explains that a request under andSection; 261.9 (which implementsFOIA) does not exhaust administrative remedies for discovery purposes inlitigation and that it is not necessary to file a request under andSection;261.9 for that purpose. This provision was added because the standardsfor determining whether to release confidential supervisory informationdiffer under FOIA from the factors to be considered for discovery in litigation.Original andSection; 261.13(c) has been incorporated into new andSection; 261.13(b)(1),and original andSection; 261.13(d) has been incorporated into new andSection;261.11(b) and andSection; 261.13(b)(2). These amendments are described above.Section andSection; 261.13(e) has been amended to reflect the changes madeto andSection; 261.13. Minor wording changes have been made to andSection; 261.14 for the sake ofclarity. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Requests for Confidential Treatment </ITAG>After the proposed regulation was published for comment, the Presidentissued Executive Order No. 12600 (June 23, 1987), which requires executiveagencies to establish procedures to notify submitters of confidential financialand commercial information of any requests for access to such information.The Executive Order is similar in substance to the proposed andSection; 261.17,which has now been modified to reflect the provisions of the ExecutiveOrder. These modifications will ensure uniformity in treatment of submittersof confidential commercial or financial information. One such modification provides in andSection; 261.17(a)(1) that a designationof confidentiality by a submitter will expire after ten years. Anothermodification, in andSection; 261.17(a)(2), gives the Secretary the discretionto notify a submitter who has not requested confidential treatment of hisinformation of a request for access, if the Secretary has a reasonableexpectation of substantial competitive harm upon disclosure. This standardof ``reasonable expectation of competitive harm'' replaces the proposedregulation's standard of ``deemed confidential under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).''A further modification provides, in andSection; 261.17(d), that when theSecretary notifies a submitter of a determination to release the informationdespite written objections by the submitter to such disclosure, the Secretarywill provide a written explanation of why the submitter's objections werenot sustained. The final change in andSection; 261.17(e) concerns the exceptionsunder which the Secretary need not notify the submitter of a request forconfidential information. This change replaces the exception for a claimof confidentiality that ``is deemed to be insubstantial'' with the exceptionused in the Executive Order_that the submitter's designation as confidentialis ``obviously frivolous.'' This change will not adversely affect the rightsof submitters since, to the extent ``deemed to be insubstantial'' differfrom ``obviously frivolous,'' the latter formulation is seen as definingthe Secretary's discretion more narrowly then the originally proposed formulation.These changes will ensure consistency of the Board's regulation with thoseused by other agencies and will avoid confusion on the part of requestersand submitters of information. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No.96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Board certifies that the proposed amendment willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. The amendment is a change to agency procedures and practice anddoes not have a particular effect on small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Freedom of Information Act, Federal Reserve System.

(See Appendix A for Schedule of Fees.) The fees set forthin the Schedule of Fees reflect the full allowable direct costs of search,duplication, and review, and may be adjusted from time to time by the Secretaryto reflect changes in direct costs.(b) <T3>Fees charged.</T3> The fees charged only cover the full allowable directcosts of search, duplication, or review.(1) ``Direct costs'' mean those expenditures which the Board actually incursin searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters,reviewing) documents to respond to a request made under andSection; 261.9of this regulation. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of theemployee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus afactor to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery.Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space,and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.(2) ``Duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy of a documentnecessary to respond to a request for disclosure of records, or for inspectionof original records that contain exempt material or that otherwise cannotbe inspected directly. Such copies may take the form of paper copy, microform,audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (<T3>e.g.,</T3> magnetic tape or disk), among others.(3) ``Review'' refers to the process of examining documents located inresponse to a request that is for a commercial use to determine whetherany portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It alsoincludes processing any documents for disclosure, <T3>e.g.,</T3> doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwiseprepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolvinggeneral legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.(c) <T3>Commercial use.</T3> (1) The fees in the Schedule of Fees for documentsearch, duplication, and review apply when records are requested for commercialuse.(2) ``Commercial use request'' refers to a request from or on behalf ofone who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial,trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalfthe request is made.(3) In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category,the Secretary shall look first to the use to which a requester will putthe documents requested. Where a requester does not explain its purpose,or where its explanation is insufficient, the Secretary may seek additionalclarification from the requester before categorizing the request as onefor commercial use.(d) <T3>Educational, research, or media use.</T3> (1) Only the fees in theSchedule of Fees for document duplication apply when records are not soughtfor commercial use and the requester is a representative of the news media,or an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purposeis scholarly or scientific research. However, there is no charge for thefirst one hundred pages of duplication.(2) ``Educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a public or privateelementary or secondary school, or an institution of undergraduate highereducation, graduate higher education, professional education, or an institutionof vocational education which operates a program of scholarly research.(3) ``Noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an institution thatis not operated on a ``commercial'' basis (as that term is used in paragraph(c) of this section) and which is operated solely for the purpose of conductingscientific research the results of which are not intended to promote anyparticular product or industry.(4) ``Representative of the news media'' refers to any person that is activelygathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publishor broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information thatis about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, televisionor radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers ofperiodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminatorsof ``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscriptionby the general public. ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded as workingfor a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expectingpublication through that organization, even though not actually employedby it.(e) <T3>Other uses.</T3> For all other requests, the fees in the Schedule ofFees for document search and duplication apply. However, there is no chargefor the first one hundred pages of duplication or the first two hours ofsearch time.(f) <T3>Aggregated requests.</T3> If the Secretary reasonably believes thata requester or group of requesters is attempting to break down a requestinto a series of requests, each seeking portions of a document or documentssolely for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, the Secretarymay aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. It is considered reasonablefor the Secretary to presume that multiple requests of this type made withina 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.(g) <T3>Payment procedures.</T3>_(1) <T3>Fee payment.</T3> The Secretary may assume that a person requestingrecords pursuant to andSection; 261.9 of this regulation will pay the applicablefees, unless a request includes a limitation on fees to be paid or seeksa waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.(2) <T3>Advance notification. </T3>If the Secretary estimates that chargesare likely to exceed $25, the requester shall be notified of the estimatedamount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance willingnessto pay fees as high as those anticipated. Upon receipt of such notice therequester may confer with the Secretary as to the possibility of reformulatingthe request in order to lower the costs.(3) <T3>Advance payment. </T3>(i) The Secretary may require advance paymentof any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Secretary may also require fullpayment in advance where a requester has previously failed to pay a feein a timely fashion.(ii) For purposes of computing the time period for responding to requestsunder andSection;261.9(b) of this regulation, the running of the time periodwill begin only after the Secretary receives the required payment.(4) <T3>Late charges. </T3>The Secretary may assess interest charges when afee is not paid within 30 days of the date on which the billing was sent.Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31 U.S.C.A.and will accrue from the date of the billing. This rate of interest ispublished by the Secretary of the Treasury before November 1 each yearand is equal to the average investment rate for Treasury tax and loan accountsfor the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year. The rate iseffective on the first day of the next calendar quarter after publication.(5) <T3>Fees for nonproductive search. </T3>Fees for record searches and reviewmay be charged even if no responsive documents are located or if the requestis denied, particularly if the requester insists upon a search after beinginformed that it is likely to be nonproductive or that any records foundare likely to be exempt from disclosure.
