Thereis no major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governmental agencies, or geographic regions; orsignificant adverse effects on completion, employments, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, theAdministrator of the Farmers Home Administration, has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities because, in terms of the total number rural communities,less than 100 will be affected annually.This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder number 10.417, ``Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants.''For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule Related Notice to 7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 19115, June 24, 1983, this program/activity is excludedfrom the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of human environment and in accordance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement isnot required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Vol. 53, No. 105, Wednesday, June 1, 1988, onpages 19924-19930. Written comments were solicited for 60 days. Commentswere received from several respondents inside and outside the Agency. Therespondents from outside the Agency were State and Federal special interestorganizations. Comments were received on 50 specific sections or paragraphswhich involved 11 different areas within the proposed regulation. Mostof the comments, however, only involved four sections: andSection;1944.456<T3>Loan and grant purposes,</T3> andSection;1944.457 <T3>Loan and grant restrictions,</T3> andSection;1944.58 <T3>Eligibility requirements,</T3> and andSection;1944.461 <T3>Security and other requirements.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Several respondents commented that additional clarification was neededto define loan purposes for the improvement and moderization of houses.The organization of Paralyzed Veterans of America suggested defining loanand grant purposes to cover adapting a home to make it accessible for peoplewith a disability or handicap. These comments were considered to have meritand were adopted.One respondent commented on loan and grant purposes stating that thereare virtually no grant programs which fund water/sewer/septic problemsor assessments. Section 1944.456(b) does authorize the payment of reasonableconnection fees, or prorata installation costs for utilities. However,while the specific payment of assessment fees is not mentioned, it wasintended to be covered by the language of that paragraph. Therefore, wehave clarified andSection;1944.456(b) to include payment of assessment feeswhich represent the property owners prorata share of the installation costof water and sewer facilites. Also, an exception was added to andSection;1944.457(b)(5),which prohibits refinancing debts or obligations incurred prior to filingan application, to allow for the payment of assessment fees.One respondent stated that the requirement concerning when a family budgetshould be prepared needed to be clarified. Because andSection; 1944.467(b)in actuality required that one be prepared in most cases and because afamily budget is currently prepared in almost all situations anyway, andSection;1944.467(b) has been revised to require one in all cases. One respondent recommended removing the total lifetime assistance requirementfor both loans and grants, and other respondents recommended increasingthe amount of lifetime assistance available because the cost of materialsand labor had increased significantly over the years while the programdollar limit had not changed. Both these comments were considered to havemerit. The amount of lifetime assistance for loans has not changed since December1976 when the limit was increased to $7,500. Based on a national averagefrom Marshall and Swift Building Cost Indexes, the cost of constructionhas increased over 85 percent since 1976. Also, the availability of loanfunds has not, historically, been a problem, so removal of the lifetimeassistance requirement would not adversely affect the number of personshelped. Therefore, the lifetime loan requirement was deleted and the amountof loan assistance available was increased to $15,000. Unfortunately, theneed and demand for grant funds exceeds the availability. Increasing theamount of lifetime grant assistance would reduce the number of personsthe program could help, therefore, the amount of grant assistance was notchanged. All of the comments received concerning allowing packaging fees as an eligibleloan/grant purpose were positive and in agreement. One comment suggestedlengthening the amortization term of loans to 30 years. This was a goodsuggestion, however statutory requirements limit section 504 loan termsto 20 years. One respondent requested additional clarification and a specific referenceadded for andSection; 1944.463(a)(2) concerning performance of developmentwork by contractors, builders or tradespersons, which was adopted. Therespondent also recommended a value estimate be documented in the casefilein lieu of doing a complete appraisal because of the age, poor design andcondition of the section 504 properties repaired. We agree a complete appraisalincluding the Marshall and Swift cost approach is time consuming and subjective,therefore, the appraisal requirement was abbreviated and the cost approachwas eliminated. One respondent commented that eliminating definitions and referencing FmHAInstruction 1944-A for basic definitions and eligibility requirements makesthe Instruction extraordinarily difficult to use, and the regulation shouldstand alone and not depend on other regulations for use. The definitions and eligibility requirements cross referenced to 1944-Awere duplication and deleting them reduced the regulation by five pages.Having ``self-contained'' program manuals would cause much duplicationand increase in the volume of procedure tremendously. Cross references,when done properly, enable policies and procedures which are common tomany programs or apply to numerous situations to be in one location, therefore,reducing duplication and the amount of volume. Exhibit A was revised to comply with the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) Circular A-102 requirements. Exhibit C was developed and added toprovide field office staffs with information and guidance concerning theadministration of packaging and packaged applications. All of the comments received were carefully considered and evaluated, andmany of the recommendations were adopted into this final rule. The followingrevisions made to the proposed regulation are attributable to the commentsreceived. 1. In andSection; 1944.456, additional clarification of loan purposes forimprovement or modernizing houses was added. 2. In andSection; 1944.456, a loan/grant purpose for making houses accessiblefor persons with a disability or handicap was added. 3. In andSection; 1944.457(a)(1), the lifetime loan assistance requirementwas deleted. 4. In andSection; 1944.458(d)(1), a definition of liquid assets was added.5. In andSection; 1944.461(a)(1)(iv), the time requirement for the unexpiredportion of the leasehold interest was changed to 2 years beyond the termof the promissory note. 6. For andSection;1944.463(a)(2) clarification and addition of a specificreference concerning performance of development work by contractors, builders,or tradepersons.7. In andSection;1944.467(a) (1) and (2), additional guidance on timelinessof processing applications was added. 8. In andSection;1944.467(b), a provision to require family budgets for allapplicants was added. 9. In andSection;1944.467(c), a provision to clarify that the use of creditreports is at no cost to the applicant was added.Additional minor changes were also made to the regulation of a clarifyingnature or to delete some extraneous material.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 1910 Credit, Grant programs_Housing and community development, Loan programs_Housingand community development.7 CFR Part 1944 Aged, Grant programs_Housing and community development, Loan programs_Housingand community development.Therefore, FmHA amends Title 7, Chapter XVIII of the Code of Federal Regulationsas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1910_GENERAL </ITAG>1.

Exhibit B of this subpart or a similarformat will be used to submit bids or cost estimates. Borrower-method constructiondockets will contain written cost estimates describing materials and specificationswith a complete cost breakdown on materials and labor for each item ofdevelopment. For development work covered by contract, Form FmHA 1924-6,``Construction Contract'', and Form FmHA 1924-2, ``Description of Materials,''will be used. In the case of substantial rehabilitation or new construction,Form FmHA 1924-19, ``Builder's Warranty,'' is required.(1) Specifications of materials must include details such as quantity,quality, sizes, grades, styles, model numbers, etc., as appropriate. Eachitem developed must be described specific enough to clearly identify thework and material to be furnished.(2) Contractors, builders, or tradespersons must be competent to performthe specified development work.
