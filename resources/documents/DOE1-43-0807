Both EPA and EPRI are sponsoring research withthe following objectives: (1) to quantify the impact on ESP performanceof various processes, and (2) to develop performance upgrading strategiesdesigned to provide cost-effective particulate control within the constraintsimposed by existing plant configurations. This paper provides resultsfrom pilot- and laboratory-scale measurements of ash/sorbent particleproperties related to ESP performance. The measurements were made onparticulate matter generated in a 1 x 10{sup 6} Btu/hr (293 kW) combustorfired on high-sulfur coal, with hydrated lime injected as a sorbent.The measurements include: (1) dust resistivity obtained in situ witha point-plane probe, (2) particle size distributions obtained with cascadeimpacts, and (3) the effects of increased fine particle loadings on ESPvoltage-current relationships. Water vapor and SO{sub 3} were each evaluatedas conditioning agents in situ and in the laboratory. A mathematicalmodel was used to project ESP performance with flue gas conditioning,over a range of SCA values up to 300 ft{sup 2}/1000 acfm (59 m{sup 2}/m{sup3}/s). 6 references, 9 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
