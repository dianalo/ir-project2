Everybody has been lookingforward to that. It's getting even time.''   Union leader Charles Bryan announced Wednesday that 97 percent ofthe voting membership had authorized a strike if no contract wasreached by midnight March 3, when a federally imposed, 30-daycooling off period expires. Eastern could then impose its own workrules.   The Miami-based carrier says it has focused on negotiating asettlement, but the union maintains Eastern has been stalling thetalks and hasn't engaged in true bargaining.   ``They have not moved in 16 months in their original openingposition,'' Bryan said.   Eastern worker Guy Knaak, who has been working on strikecontingency plans while on a 30-day suspension for walking out in adispute over mandatory overtime, said Lorenzo has not budged whilethe union has made some concessions.   ``I don't think Frank Lorenzo wants a settlement,'' Knaak said.   The union also contended that management has started recruitmentof possible strikebreakers.   Members of the Machinists union, representing 8,500 machinists,baggage handlers and other ground workers, have been working withouta contract for 13 months. If there is no resolution by late nextweek, federal mediators plan to bring both sides together inWashington.   The Machinists represent more than a quarter of Eastern's workforce. Eastern management has been seeking substantial contractconcessions, saying the union members' wages are too high and havemade the airline non-competitive.   Meanwhile, the carrier charged that an illegal work slowdown hasbacked up 19 aircraft and delayed flights.   Eastern attorney David Ross charged in federal court Wednesdaythat the Machinists have caused the aircraft backup by taking twicethe normal time to perform tasks ranging from routine mechanicalinspections to major overhauls.   ``Historically we have had no backup,'' the attorney said. ``Wewould normally only have a certain number (of planes) in being doneand then put back in service.''   Bryan called the charge ``a smokescreen. The work is being done.''   Bryan said that Eastern's recent performance _ it advertisesitself as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry, citing federalfigures _ refutes the carrier's allegation of widespread workslowdowns.   ``How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowingdown?'' he said.   The airline and union also pressed their arguments in federalcourt Wednesday regarding the subcontracting of work traditionallydone by organized labor.   U.S. Senior District Judge C. Clyde Atkins agreed to accept theMachinists subcontracting case, after U.S. District Judge James W.Kehoe granted Eastern's motion Wednesday to send the case to Atkins.   Atkins, who ordered an end to a wildcat strike by ground crewslast week, directed Eastern to file a response in the subcontractingcase by noon today.   In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, the airline said it had nochoice but to subtract certain work because of ``circumstancesbeyond its control.''   In another development, the union charged that Eastern hasstarted recruiting strikebreakers with newspaper ads offeringairport opportunities for baggage handlers, agents and managers butlisting no employer.</TEXT></DOC>
