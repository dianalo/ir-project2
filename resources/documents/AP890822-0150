The proposal would require operators to implement newrequirements for medical evaluation and transfer of miners exposedto certain carcinogens, a summary of the proposal said.   The proposal would reduce the permitted amount of dust in theair, avberaged over an eight-hour shift, from 10 milligrams percubic meter (1.3 cubic yards or 35 cubic feet), measured asnon-quartz dust, to 5 milligrams of all breatheable dust not coveredby a separate substance standard.   The proposed new standard would cover more situations, the agencysaid.   The separate standard for coal mines, 2 milligrams per cubicmeter, the agency said.   Among other things, the new standard for asbestos would be200,000 fibers per cubic meter instead of 2 million fibers. Thiswould bring the asbestos standard for mines into conformity with thegeneral workplace standard adopted by the sister Occupational Safetyand Health Administration in 1986.   The public may submit comments on the proposal until Nov. 27.</TEXT></DOC>
