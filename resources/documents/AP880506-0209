Capt. Dominique Prieur's departure from Hao, a French militarybase, came about five months after the other agent convicted in theincident, Maj. Alain Mafart, was returned to Paris. Mafart hadcomplained of a stomach ailment.   Mrs. Prieur's release also came two days before a presidentialelection that pits Chirac, a conservative, against FrancoisMitterrand, the Socialist incumbent and heavy favorite.   The newspaper Le Monde said: ``You can't make us believe thatthe captain's condition demands that her situation be arranged 48hours before the elections.''   Destruction of the protest ship in July 1985 at its berth inAuckland, New Zealand, was a fiasco for the French secret service.It was a dark hour for the Mitterrand administration but theagents, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, were heroes at home.   Defense Minister Andre Giraud greeted Mrs. Prieur and herhusband Joel when they arrived late Friday night at Villacoublaymilitary airport near Paris. The couple left without making anycomment to reporters. Prieur, a Defense Department employee, wasposted to Hao after his wife was exiled there.   Mrs. Prieur, 38, and Mafart, 37, were arrested after explosivesattached to the hull sank the Rainbow Warrior, which was preparingto sail to the French nuclear test site in the South Pacific. AGreenpeace photographer was killed.   They were sentenced to 10 years each in a New Zealand prison butunder an accord reached by the United Nations in 1986 were toremain on Hao for three years.   Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand said freeing Mrs.Prieur is a ``breach of France's obligation under internationallaw.''   Chirac told a campaign luncheon in Agen: ``Mrs. Prieur is nowpregnant, and the accord foresaw that, in this circumstance, sheshould be returned to Paris. I respect my signature. ... when Isign an accord, it should be known that I respect it.''   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said an illness in Mrs. Prieur'sfamily ``accelerated'' the release.   Louis Maire, Mrs. Prieur's father, is hospitalized with anunspecified illness. He told Monte Carlo radio he had not known ofhis daughter's return, but ``I'm very sick so it will be a pleasureto see her before dying.''   Lange said in a statement that her departure from Hao ``is notconsented to'' and he will pursue the matter with France next week.   At the United Nations in New York, French AmbassadorPierre-Louis Blanc met with Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar to discuss the circumstances surrounding Friday'srepatriation.   Benedicte Scalabre, a press attache to the French U.N. mission,called it ``just an informational meeting.'' He refused comment onwhether pregnancy was a condition for repatriation under the U.N.agreement.   A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said the governmentlearned of the pregnancy several days ago.   ``The New Zealand government was immediately informed and at thesame time invited to proceed with a medical examination,'' thespokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with Frenchpractice.   The newspaper Le Monde said Mrs. Prieur's baby is expected earlynext year.   Lange denounced Mafart's return to France in December and onMarch 31, at New Zealand's request, a Dutch diplomat was sent toHao to make sure Mrs. Prieur was still there.   The New Zealand government has has tried unsuccessfully to forcethe return of Mafart, who has completed entrance examinations for aFrench war college since arriving in France.   Chirac's announcement of Mrs. Prieur's release came a day afterthree French hostages were freed in Lebanon and 23 hostages held byseparatists in New Caledonia were rescued from a cave in a surpriseassault by security forces.   There was speculation those events were timed to coincide withthe French election.   The Rainbow Warrier bombing occurred while a Socialistgovernment was in power. Defense Minister Charles Hernu resignedand the intelligence chief was dismissed, but polls indicated theFrench people were less concerned about the bombing than thebungling of the operation.</TEXT></DOC>
