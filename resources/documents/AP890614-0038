But other nations at the two-day U.N. Conference on IndochineseRefugees _ including Britain, China, Thailand, the Philippines andthe Netherlands _ support such a policy.   The conference is expected to formally endorse measures designedto deter the mounting number of Vietnamese fleeing economic problemsrather than political persecution.   The plan will introduce screening procedures in the countries offirst refuge to determine whether new arrivals can claim politicalasylum and refugee status and are thus eligible for resettlement. Itcall for the return of all ``non-refugees'' to their homeland.   On the first day of the conference Monday, attended by 60countries, Hong Kong Gov. Sir David Wilson, backed by Britain, hadurged quick mandatory repatriation of all boat people denied refugeestatus.   ``The consequences for Hong Kong are appalling,'' said Wilson.``Our resources have been overwhelmed.''   Wilson disputed assertions that mandatory repatriation wasinhumane.   ``The real inhumanity is to encourage people to leave Vietnamwith women and children in unsafe boats in the hope of getting todestinations on the far side of the world which they will neverreach because the doors are closed,'' he said.   With 43,000 boat people, Hong Kong has by far the largest numberof Vietnamese in any territory in the region.   British Foreign Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe said the influx hasput an ``intolerable'' burden on Hong Kong and caused a ``majorhumanitarian crisis'' in the British colony, already one of the mostdensely populated places in the world.   Soviet chief delegate Genrikh V. Kireev told the conferencetoday, ``Repatriation of refugees should be carried out only on thevoluntary basis,'' echoing statements made Tuesday by U.S. DeputySecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Foreign Minister NguyenCo Thach of Vietnam.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, saysif the conference approves the plan, the number of boat peoplereturning voluntarily should rise.   Vietnam has given assurances to the U.N. agency that no punitiveaction will be taken against these returnees. It has said it willnot accept those returned against their will.   Since March, only 143 boat people have voluntarily returned, afraction of the number who arrive daily in the region's coastalstates. The Hong Kong branch of the Oxfam relief agency hassupported the governor's call for mandatory action, saying voluntaryrepatriation does not work.   The draft plan before the conference, while making clear allnon-refugees should return, makes no explicit recommendation howthis should be done.   The number of boat people declined in the early 1980's but theexodus has accelerated again. Nearly 90,000 Vietnamese, three timesthe 1986 total, now live in refugee camps.   Another 100,000 refugees from Cambodia and Laos also live incamps.   Wilson said screening procedures instituted by Hong Kong lastyear, and expected to be adopted under the U.N. plan, showed mostnew arrivals do not qualify for refugee status.   ``Their reasons for leaving Vietnam are essentially economic,''he said, making them ineligible for resettlement in third countries,specifically in North America, where most hope to go.   The United States has accepted 900,000 of the 1.5 millionIndochinese who fled their homes since the Vietnam War ended inApril 1975.   Eagleburger announced the United States is prepared to resettle22,000 of the 55,000 Vietnamese who arrived in Southeast Asiannations before any screening procedures were instituted. He alsosaid the United States anticipates accepting up to half of all newarrivals granted refugee status.</TEXT></DOC>
