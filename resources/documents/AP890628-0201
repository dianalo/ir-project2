(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gunshots rang out Wednesday in the coalfields of Virginia and West Virginia, ending a lull in wildcatwalkouts by at least 37,000 miners in eight states who ignored afederal judge's order to refrain from strike activities.   Hundreds of United Mine Workers members from six states cloggedVirginia roads used by coal truckers for Pittston Coal Group Inc.,the company at the heart of the wildcat sympathy strikes.   ``These men ain't going back,'' said George Thacker, president ofUnited Mine Workers Local 1890 in Langsville, Ohio. ``We've got totake a stand sometime. It might as well be now.''   In St. Paul, Va., nearly 3,000 striking United Mine Workers andsupporters, including about 300 steel workers, rallied Wednesdaynight to show the solidarity of organized labor against Pittston.   ``We're going to hang together: We're going to win this thing, ''UMW organization director Ron Baker said, drawing chants of ``union,union'' from the crowd.   Wildcat strikers from a half dozen states also joined the rally.   ``Every union man in this country has a stake in this, said MikeHathaway, a wildcat striker from Steelville, Ill. ``If they breakthis union, they'll break every union right on down the line.''   Four coal trucks were peppered with gunfire in West Virginia andVirginia, police said. No injuries were reported and no arrests weremade.   Gov. Gaston Caperton, who has tried to bring Pittston and theUnited Mine Workers together for talks, reiterated that state policewould investigate all reported violence and make arrests whenpossible.   ``The use of criminal activity by either side of the conflict inour coal field is an intolerable response to labor-managementproblems,'' he said.   At least 37,000 union miners remained on strike Wednesday. Anadditional 6,000 had been on strike, but it was unclear if they hadreturned to work or were on vacation. The miners' staggered two-weekvacation periods began this week.   The wildcat walkouts are in support of 1,900 UMW members who areon strike against Pittston in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentuckyin a contract dispute. At one point, the wildcat walkouts included46,000 miners in Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois,Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia. Theminers in Missouri and Virginia have gone back to work.   In Greenwich, Conn., outside the headquarters of The Pittston Co._ Pittston Coal Group's parent company _ the UMW held a memorialWednesday. About 350 miners, wives and children from Virginia andPennsylvania brought 350 small white painted wooden crosses bearingthe names of coal miners killed or injured in mine accidents.   The UMW said it would encourage the wildcat strikers to complywith U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp's order to refrain from strikeactivities.   Knapp said the wildcat strikes break National Labor Relations Actguidelines against secondary strikes, and ordered UMW officials toreport to the NLRB within 10 days on what steps they have taken tomeet the court order.   The UMW says it is not responsible for the wildcat strikes, whichviolate the contract the union signed in February 1988 with theBituminous Coal Operators Association. The BCOA represents mostmajor coal operators but not Pittston.   ``The union hasn't sanctioned the strikes, and we will doeverything we can to comply, but we feel the judge's orders reallyare a slap in the face of any kind of democracy,'' said UMW District17 official Howard Green.   Shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines Thursday andFriday for the first time since the wildcat strikes began June 12.No one was seriously injured.   Three trucks were shot Wednesday morning in Boone County south ofCharleston and the radiator of one truck was shot out, state policesaid. The drivers, who were hauling coal for Elk Run Mining Co.,were uninjured, said state police Sgt. Gary Bain.   Elk Run Mining is a subsidiary of A.T. Massey Coal Co. A coaltruck driver for an A.T. Massey subsidiary was shot to death in a1984 ambush during a 15-month UMW strike.   In addition to those three trucks, two trucks were hit Wednesdayin the Montgomery area, southeast of Charleston, by steel ballsfired from a slingshot, state police said.   In Virginia, a coal truck's radiator was shot out Wednesdaymorning near Pittston's main coal processing plant in RussellCounty, said state police spokesman Charlie Vaughan.   A manager at a non-union mine operated by Addington ResourcesInc. of Ashland, Ky., was struck in the eye Tuesday by a rock hurledthrough his truck window near Boomer, in the Montgomery area.   In southwestern Virginia, UMW members from six states continuedto create traffic jams on coal-hauling roads Wednesday despitefacing daily fines of $120,000 from a federal judge. Hundreds ofcars and trucks slowly paraded on a narrow road linking PittstonCoal Group's main processing plant with mines, Vaughan said.   Virginia state police wrote 118 tickets for impeding trafficTuesday, only 12 of them to Virginia drivers. The rest were issuedto drivers from Indiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois andPennsylvania.</TEXT></DOC>
