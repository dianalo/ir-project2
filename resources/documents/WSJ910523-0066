Thus, if State has any clout at all, theforthcoming Justice Department report on 103 will concentratealmost solely on Libya's involvement.   This is another example of an apparently endless list ofdead American citizens and others the State Department iseager to sacrifice to illusion, who have no recourse for whatseems perpetual knavery and poltroonery. State's absolutionof Syria for its crimes against humanity is continuing. Thereis precedent for the &quot;blame Libya&quot; focus, a precedent thatshould -- but likely will not -- cause a scandal calling fora congressional investigation.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. bombed Libya in April 1986 for its role in thedeaths of Americans in a Berlin nightclub in 1985. We warnedbefore the World Affairs Council in January 1987 that Syriawould be found to be equally culpable; in January 1988, WestGermany disclosed that a captured perpetrator had named Syriaas intensively involved. Did State demand equal treatment forDamascus as for Tripoli, Libya?   It is likely that Hafez Assad initiated the idea to bombFlight 103 as one more incident to discredit political foes-- and he must still be laughing at Iran's eager and timelyoffer to pay $10 million for what Syria planned to do anyway.   Norman Higby   Menlo Park, Calif.   ---   In 1988 George Bush made effective use of Willie Horton topresent the idea that if elected, Mr. Bush would be tough oncrime. The president is now faced with the opportunity tolive up to his tough-on-crime image. If it turns out that theSyrians and Iranians are implicated, it is Mr. Bush'sobligation to prosecute them. It is unthinkable that suchterrorist actions be sanctioned by the president's refusal toprosecute. I sincerely hope he does not send the message thatterrorism backed by international clout is unpunishable. Asfor sealed and secret indictments to save the faces of thecountries involved, it does not wash. The world has a rightto know how the nations operate and the severity of theproblem.   William T.
