In announcing his selection of Adm. James D. Watkins to head theEnergy Department, Bush said Thursday that Watkins would oversee thedaunting task of repairing the department's crippled nuclear weaponscomplex. Safety and other problems recently forced the closing ofthe country's only facilities producing tritium, a vital ingredientfor nuclear warheads.   Watkins was trained in nuclear reactor engineering early in his41-year Navy career, worked in the Naval nuclear office of thenow-defunct Atomic Energy Commission and later commanded anuclear-power submarine.   But he has no professional experience in the conventional energyareas, such as oil and natural gas, that are more commonlyassociated with the Energy Department.   ``You're touching me on my Achilles' heel,'' Watkins said inresponse to a news conference question Thursday about his views onhow to shore up domestic oil prices.   This admitted weakness, and Bush's clear interest in focusing onproblems in the nuclear weapons complex, has caused some concernabout how the new administration will address other energy issuessuch as the growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.   ``Our initial reaction is definitely one of disappointment,''said Tom Haywood, executive vice president of the North Texas Oil andamp;Gas Association, a producers trade group. ``We had hoped for someonewho could come in knowing the domestic oil business,'' he said,adding that he expected Watkins to be a ``quick study.''   Bryan Jacobowski, an energy analyst at the Wall Street firm ofPaine Webber Inc., said oil industry executives had figured Bushwould pick ``somebody who was a bit more of an advocate'' for theirinterests on Capitol Hill.   In part, the selection of a military official to head energypolicy reflects a declining emphasis within the Energy Department oncivilian energy issues. In the current fiscal year the department isspending 58 percent of its $15 billion budget on defense programs;in 1982 the defense share was 28 percent.   George H. Lawrence, president of the American Gas Association,representing natural gas producers, hailed Watkins' ``provenmanagerial skills'' and said his nuclear background will help insolving the nuclear defense problems.   But, he said, ``It is especially important that this nationalsecurity issue be handled skillfully ... so it does not become anabiding distraction to other energy issues.''   The natural gas industry's main concern about leadership in theEnergy Department is that it help win congressional approval to endthe remaining price controls on gas.   Bush has pushed aside suggestions that oil executives need worryabout his choice.   ``They've got a president of the United States that came out ofthe oil and gas industry, that knows it and knows it well,'' he saidThursday.   Some analysts said the Watkins choice appeared to reflect arelaxed attitude by Bush about the possibility of a new oil crisisdeveloping in the 1990s.   ``It suggests the (Bush) administration doesn't see a majorproblem in fossil fuels in the near future,'' said John Lichtblau,executive director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation,which is supported by oil industry funds. He added that he disagreeswith this view and is concerned that if the OPEC cartel falls intodisarray again, oil prices could fall low enough to harm U.S.security.   Environmental groups also expressed mild concern about Watkins.   Stephen Schwartz, of the Greenpeace environmental organization,said he hoped the choice of Watkins ``does not reflect a decision toplace military production needs ahead of safety and theenvironment.''   Dan W. Reicher, an attorney for the environmental group NaturalResources Defense Council, said his group was worried that nucleardefense needs would get too much attention in an Energy Departmentheaded by a career military man.   ``We are concerned that the appointment of Adm. Watkins signalsthat cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound nationalenergy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclearweapons production,'' Reicher said.</TEXT></DOC>
