Several askarel transformers were drained, filledwith trichlorotrifluoroethane (R113) for eighteen hours, drained again,and the core-coil assemblies were untanked. The clamps were removed,the core laminations were separated, and the coils were unwound. Thematerials in the various substructures were accumulated separately andthe metallic and ceramic parts were separated from the cellulosic andother polymeric parts wherever possible. The weights of the various componentswere measured during disassembly and wipe samples for PCB analysis weretaken from surfaces such as the tank wall after the R113 soak, the separatedcore laminations, and the unwound high - and low-voltage conductors.PCB contaminated oil-filled units were torn-down following this sameprocedure, but with two differences. Initial R113 soaks and the lastcleanings of metallic parts were omitted. The weights and analyticalresults were used to reconstruct the distributions of PCBs in the varioussubstructures as the tear-down progressed. These distributions are presentedand the implications of these results to disposal and retrofilling oftransformers containing PCBs are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
