The disclosure of the Matsushita-MCA discussions comesjust as the Federal Communications Commission weighs whetherto ease regulations that block the NBC, ABC and CBS networksfrom the $3-billion-a-year syndication market. Because themajor studios are heavily involved in syndicating reruns andfirst-run shows to local stations, the FCC rules all buteliminate the networks as potential bidders for anyproduction company.</LP><TEXT>   Network officials yesterday said that any FCC action tolift the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Ruleswould likely come too late to let the networks bid for MCAand its Universal television and film operations. But thepossible purchase of MCA already is being brandished bynetwork lobbyists who are arguing that the restrictionsshould be lifted.   The &quot;fin-syn&quot; rules have been left untouched for twodecades, but in the past year the networks have made majorprogress in arguing for revisions -- in part by hammering thesteady encroachment on Hollywood by foreign rivals.   &quot;From a policy perspective,&quot; says NBC general counsel RickCotton, the MCA talks &quot;sure ought to be a final nail in thecoffin.&quot; He adds: &quot;The apparent discussions between MCA andMatsushita underline the imperative for Washington policymakers to deal urgently with getting rid of the rules andallowing the three U.S. networks to compete in the globalmarketplace.&quot;   The networks' major opponent in the fight over the rerunrules, the Motion Picture Association of America, declined tocomment on the MCA discussions. But studio officials seemlikely to greet word of a Matsushita overture grimly.   If Matsushita ultimately is able to buy MCA, three of theeight major studios that comprise the association will beforeign-owned. Sony Corp. acquired Columbia PicturesEntertainment earlier this year. Australia's News Corp. ownsthe Twentieth Century Fox film studio and the Fox network.And Pathe Communications Corp., controlled by Italianfinancier Giancarlo Parretti, is trying to complete itsacquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co.   A Matsushita-MCA merger also would mean that overone-third of the three networks' prime-time schedule will beproduced by foreign-owned companies, an NBC spokesman said.   Senators and congressmen &quot;became more willing to let theFCC move&quot; on lifting the rerun rules when Sony acquiredColumbia earlier this year, says George Vradenburg, generalcounsel for CBS Inc. &quot;If Matsushita acquires MCA, it willreinforce the view that the regulations are totally out ofdate in today's world-wide marketplace.&quot;   Yesterday, Mr. Vradenburg got his first crack atcapitalizing on the MCA-Matsushita ties, as he, CBS PresidentLaurence A. Tisch and Mr. Tisch's key political operative,Senior Vice President Jay Kriegel, met with FCC CommissionerJames Duggan to lobby for lifting the rerun rules. The MCAdisclosure &quot;came up obliquely,&quot; Mr. Vradenburg says.   Even FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has pointed a finger atthe foreign incursions -- not because they should beprohibited, but because the networks can't take the samesteps, given the rules that block them from the rerun market.In a speech to a television trade group last week, Mr. Sikesnoted that federal law would bar NBC's owner, GeneralElectric Co., from acquiring a studio. &quot;But we have nospecial rules regarding the acquisition of a major studio bya Japan-based electronics firm, such as Sony,&quot; the FCCchairman said.   Mr. Sikes has said that the FCC will hold a hearing thisfall to hear all sides of the rerun debate, and that thecommission hopes to issue a ruling in the first quarter ofnext year.   Whether Matsushita itself culminates its talks byacquiring MCA, however, is another matter.   Several takeover-stock traders put the odds at only 50-50that Matsushita will buy MCA for a price of $80 to $90 ashare. That explains why MCA shares closed yesterday at only$54 each, up $19.50. If Matsushita actually buys MCA,shareholders could get an additional $30 a share. If notransaction results, MCA shares would fall $15 to $20 each,several traders said.   But it seems unlikely that many U.S. companies have thedesire or the wherewithal to fund an acquisition in the $6billion to $7 billion range that MCA and Matsushita are saidto be discussing. That is especially true given the rerunregulations that rule out three well-heeled suitors: CBS,NBC, and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.   Other U.S. movie studios might run into antitrust problemsin buying MCA. In addition, financial players, such asleveraged buy-out firms, would find it difficult to raise the$8 billion or more in financing that a buy-out of MCA wouldrequire. If a buyer of MCA paid more than $90 a share, thedeal would be nearly twice the size of the proposed buy-outof UAL Corp., which has floundered for more than a year.   &quot;It would be hard to compete with a Japanese buyer aslarge and as well-heeled as Matsushita,&quot; said one takeoverstock trader. &quot;It's also hard to see somebody raising $8billion in this market.&quot;   But Jessica Reif, an analyst who follows MCA for FirstBoston Corp., believes it is likely that MCA will be sold,even if the talks with Matsushita break down. Theacknowledgment by MCA that it is talking about a friendlyacquisition &quot;seems to put a `For Sale' sign up,&quot; Ms. Reifsays. &quot;I put it at better than 50-50 that something could getdone.&quot;   ---   David B.
