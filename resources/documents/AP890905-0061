Security checks have begun on Woolsey, a lawyer who apparentlyowes his nomination over two other candidates to his close ties toBrent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The two other candidates were Stephen Ledogar, a foreign serviceofficer who now holds the job, and Phil Karber, vice president ofthe BDM Corp. who evidently had the backing of Vice President DanQuayle.   News of Woolsey's likely selection was first reported in today'seditions of The Washington Times.   The negotiations resume Thursday in Geneva between the 16-nationNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven-nation Warsaw Pactled by the Soviet Union.   Bush has raised expectations of an accord by the end of the year,but that now appears only a long-shot possibility.   Woolsey, whose nomination would require Senate approval, wouldbring to the job a reputation for political skill as well as weaponsexpertise. As a conservative Democrat he has close ties with Sen.Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, while retaining the trust of defense-minded Republicans.   Woolsey, 48, was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carteradministration and has served on the staffs of the National SecurityCouncil and the Senate Armed Services Committee.   As an outside adviser to the Reagan administration, Woolseyjoined with Scowcroft in recommending development of the Midgetmanmissile, a mobile, single-warhead weapon.   Bush in April decided to proceed with a plan to buy and deploy300 to 500 new Midgetman missiles to be carried on trucks and alsoproposed that 50 MX missiles now housed in fixed, underground silosbe pulled out and put on rail cars.   Cost of the two programs, if Congress provides the funds, couldexceed $40 billion.   The negotiations in Geneva, known formally as the ConventionalForce Reduction Talks, are designed to produce a treaty settingequal ceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks, artillery, armoredtroop carriers, aircraft, helicopters and possibly manpower.   Bush said in June he wanted to complete the agreement within sixmonths to a year, but the two alliances have not yet agreed on anumber of basic issues, including measures to verify an agreementwould be kept.   The nomination of Woolsey initially had been expected lastspring, but then was delayed while consideration was given also toKarber and to retaining Ledogar.</TEXT></DOC>
