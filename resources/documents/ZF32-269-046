 There is a warmsatisfaction in finding out that someone as arrogant and offensive as DonaldTrump really is as sleazy as you thought he was.andP;  But Silicon Valley'sfavorite soap opera--the internal workings of Apple Computer--is muchlonger-running and is usually recounted with more sadness than glee.andP;  Donaldand Ivana are a diverting side show, but there are a lot of people who reallycare about what Apple does.andM;Apple's special position.andP;  People expect Apple to be different from (read&quot;better than&quot;) other computer companies.andP;  Apple has been the embodiment of adifferent vision of computing.andP;  Everyone has his or her own vision of whatApple should be and what Apple should be doing.andP;  Apple is judged againstthese standards.andM;People do not have similar expectations for IBM, Compaq or even Microsoft.andO;(Everyone expects Microsoft system software to be clunky and Apple systemsoftware to be elegant.)andP;  It is hard to find anyone in this business--user,third-party software developer or computer vendor competitor--who does nothave strong opinions about what Apple products should look like and whatApple should be doing.andM;Apple's culture.andP;  Apple has also been a pretty indulgent place to work.andP;  Thecompany makes the highest gross margins on its products of any company in theindustry.andP;  Pay is high.andP;  Benefits are excellent.andP;  And there is a history ofan &quot;Apple&quot; (read &quot;expensive&quot;) way of doing things.andM;There is also a history of leaking information to the press.andP;  We know of nocompany in any industry that is as &quot;public&quot; in this respect as Apple.andO;Product plans and development code names are routinely reported in the tradepress.andP;  Some of this comes from outsiders (industry analysts and third-partydevelopers who violate their nondisclosure agreements), but a surprisingamount comes from Apple employees.andP;  MacWeek (known in the trade as&quot;MacLeak&quot;), in particular, seems to have an excellent informationpipeline--which is one of the reasons Apple management detests thepublication.andM;The favorite parlor game.andP;  For most of 1989, Silicon Valley's favorite topicof conversation was &quot;What's wrong with Apple?&quot;andP;  Everyone had differentanalyses, but the underlying assumption behind all of the conversations wasthat there was, indeed, something wrong.andP;  There was also, we should note,&quot;something wrong&quot; at other companies--including Sun Microsystems.andP;  However,as we noted above, Apple is &quot;special.&quot;andP;  Moreover, Sun was in crisis mode,working to solve its acknowledged problems.andP;  Apple blithely denied that therewas anything to be concerned about.andM;Much of the discussion centered on Apple organization, politics and morale:the impact of frequent reorganizations; the &quot;culture clash&quot; between Al Loren(president of Apple USA) and other executives and rank-and-file Appleemployees; the sense that Apple had changed.andM;But people also worried about Apple's product line.andP;  Where were theinnovative new products?andM;There was also a sense that Apple sales were slowing--especially at the lowend of the product line.andP;  This perception was confirmed in January when Appleannounced disappointing sales for the first quarter of the fiscal year (thelast quarter of 1989).andM;The reorganization.andP;  Apple president John Sculley moved quickly.andP;  Lorenresigned as president of Apple USA.andP;  Michael Spindler, a German who iscredited for Apple's recent success in European markets, was promoted frompresident of Apple Europe to the newly created post of chief operatingofficer.andM;This was a significant change in the top company's executive structure.andP;  Inhis previous top-level reorganization, Sculley had created four companydivisions, each headed by a division president: three sales/service companies(Apple USA, Apple Europe and Apple Pacific), plus a product development andmanufacturing company (Apple Products).andP;  Jean-Louis Gassee, president ofApple Products, had responsibility for product engineering, productmanufacturing, product marketing and advanced technology.andP;  As COO, Spindlerwas given responsibility for all three sales companies (U.S., Europe andPacific) plus two areas that had been part of Apple Products: manufacturingand product marketing.andM;Jean-Louis Gassee would still report to Sculley, but he had lostresponsibility for manufacturing and marketing.andP;  He was to concentrateexclusively on Randamp;D.andM;The nightmare month.andP;  The next chapter opened in February with a story in theWall Street Journal that Gassee, his role reduced by the reorganization andhis honor impugned by reports that Sculley had publicly chastised him for theslow pace of Apple product development, would leave Apple.andM;The next three weeks unfolded as a surreal drama.andP;  Apple announced that itwas negotiating with Gassee.andP;  Apple employees held a rally to support Gassee.andO;To trim marketing and overhead costs, Spindler laid off 400 employees(approximately 3% of the 13,500-person workforce).andP;  Apple employeescomplained about the disparity between bonuses and perks provided to topexecutives and the treatment of lesser employees.andP;  Sculley sent the Appleemployees on AppleLink (as well as everyone else on AppleLink, including thispublication) an electronic mail message defending his actions.andP;  Gasseeofficially resigned, and Sculley announced that he would step in to directRandamp;D himself.andM;Where this leaves Apple.andP;  There do not seem to be many people mourning thepassing of Loren.andP;  Gassee, however, was popular among Appleemployees--especially those who worked for him.andP;  We presume that Apple islooking for a replacement.andP;  Sculley appears to favor a somewhat detachedmanagement style, and we expect that he is looking for a visionary/leadertype to fill the crucial development slot.andM;There are many new products in the pipeline; we expect that they should rollout on schedule.andP;  The first of these is the high-end Macintosh IIfx, whichmade its debut as planned on March 17.andP;  (See the second part of this storyfor details.)andM;In the meantime, Spindler is moving rapidly to put his mark on the companyand its product line.andP;  One of his first moves was to reduce pricing onLaserWriters and Macintosh SEs to make them more competitive.andP;  The list priceof the LaserWriter IINT has been reduced from $4,999 to $4,499; the NTX hasbeen cut from $6,999 to $5,999.andP;  A 1-MB SE with a 20-MB disk now lists for$2,969, $500 less than before.andP;  A 4-MB SE/30 with 80-MB disk lists for$5,569--a $1,000 drop.andP;  (Street prices are typically 25% to 30% less.)andM;Spindler also extended the warranty on Apple hardware from a meager 90 daysto a full year.andP;  This extension is retroactive on all purchases made sinceJanuary 1.andM;Apple's competitive position.andP;  In the somewhat longer term, Spindler andSculley face some interesting challenges.andP;  The implications of decisions madeseveral years ago are now coming home to roost.andM;As our readers are well aware, we have long argued that Apple faced a windowof opportunity from approximately 1987 until approximately 1990.andP;  Apple hadmore of the desktop computing environment for the 1990s in place than anyother vendor.andP;  We believe that, with the right products and aggressivepricing, it could have carved out a market share that would have put it in aformidable market position to enter the more competitive world of the 1990s.andO;In essence, we were asking Apple to trade product margins for strategicmarket share.andP;  This, we are certain, is what a Japanese company would havedone.andP;  We even think that it would have been fairly easy to explain to WallStreet.andM;In particular, at the time the Macintosh II was being developed, we arguedstrenuously that Apple really needed a modular machine (basically the IIcxconfiguration) aimed at the heart of the business market with a $3,000 to$4,000 selling price.andP;  The appliance Macs (the Mac Plus and SE) should havebeen driven down-market to cover the home, school and low-end office markets.andM;Apple chose instead to go for high profit margins, justified by the argumentthat Apple needs higher margins than other companies because it must carrythe burden of developing both its own hardware and its own system software.andM;Regardless of what Apple might have done, the window of opportunity is nowclosing, and Apple will face an increasingly competitive market.andP;  The rate ofgrowth in personal computer sales has slowed and, as everyone predicted,Apple is losing some of its unique advantage.andM;Windows 3.0.andP;  It now looks as if the biggest immediate challenge to Applewill come not from OS/2 Presentation Manager but from Microsoft Windows.andO;Customers have been slow to accept OS/2, largely because they haven't seenits benefits.andP;  Meanwhile, the Windows graphic operating environment forMS-DOS has become better than anyone expected, and it is beginning to have areal impact in the market.andM;According to reports in the computer industry trade press, Windows will takea quantum leap forward with the release of the next version, Windows 3.0,this spring.andP;  Windows 3.0 could make Apple's worst fears materialize.andM;One of the problems with the Windows environment has been that it does notprovide the kind of application-to-application consistency of user interfaceone gets with the Mac.andP;  It now looks as if the Mac conventions may become thede facto Windows conventions as well.andM;A lot of Mac developers are now working on Windows versions of theirsoftware.andP;  Several of these vendors have told us that in the absence of anyWindows-specific conventions, they plan to do the logical thing: they willcarry the conventions they use in their Mac programs over to the Windowsversions of these same programs.andM;There will still be differences, of course.andP;  The Mac is still likely to havean edge in display quality, aesthetics and refinement, but the differencesmay be more matters of degree than the differences in kind that have existeduntil now.andM;Good news, bad news.andP;  This is a good-news/bad-news development for Apple.andO;The bad news is, of course, that this will make the PC more &quot;Mac-like&quot; andmake it possible to have identical software with nearly identical userinterfaces running on both the Mac and the PC.andP;  It will also be lesstraumatic for PC users to migrate to Windows than it will be for them to moveto OS/2.andM;The good news is that if Windows 3.0 is half as good as people are saying itwill be, it cannot help but slow acceptance of OS/2.andP;  It will probably takemost PC users quite some time to absorb all the capabilities Windows willgive them before they are ready to move on to the more powerful capabilitiesof OS/2.andP;  This means that for the next few years Apple will really becompeting more against Windows than against OS/2.andM;Given DOS's inherent limitations, we expect that the advances Apple isputting into System 7.0 will make it a better, more sophisticated and moreattractive environment than a DOS-based environment such as Windows can be.andM;User wins.andP;  From the user's standpoint, the porting of Mac software (userinterface and all) to the PC is good news.andP;  We hope that more developersfollow this course.andP;  As users who work routinely in a mixed Mac/PCenvironment, we look forward to being able to use the same user interfaceconventions on both platforms.andM;Fending off Unix.andP;  We think that the new 40-MHz IIfx and the graphicaccelerator cards (covered on the following pages) are very important to theApple product line because they will help to keep power users (who mightotherwise have defected to Unix workstations) in the Mac family.andP;  Mostprospective IIfx users are probably supported by some number of users withless demanding assignments who will work on less powerful and less expensiveMacs.andP;  Apple does not want the people at the top of the pyramid defecting.andM;Hardware.andP;  Down the rest of the product line, Apple will almost certainlyhave to make changes to meet the more direct threat from PCs.andP;  The aggressivemid-range and low-end products that might have helped Apple build marketshare over the past few years will now be essential to maintaining share inan increasingly competitive market.andM;The same pressure will apply to Apple's lucrative laser printer business.andO;Until now, Apple has competed mainly with &quot;off-brand&quot; PostScript printers.andO;Now it will be up against the likes of HP and IBM, as well as increasinglycapable products from well-known companies such as Texas Instruments.andM;Although most PC printer vendors (including IBM) do not yet understand whatit takes to make their products work as effective Macintosh printers, a lotof users want to be able to drive the same printer from both their Macs andtheir PCs.andP;  The vendors will be forced to make their printers work with Macsas well as PCs.andP;  As they do, they will be competing head-to-head with Applefor the same customers.andM;Evolution.andP;  As we have noted before, we think that Apple has some importantcompetitive advantages.andP;  One of the most important is that it offers anevolutionary future path for both users and third-party software developers.andO;However, from here on out, it is likely to be pushed harder than it has beenduring the past few years.andP;  The beneficiaries will be the users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
