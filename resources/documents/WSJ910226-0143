The Corporation for Open Systems, a nonprofit group thattests computer and telecommunications gear, plans to announcetoday that it has agreed to adhere to standard technicalspecifications set by Bell Communications Research Inc., theresearch arm owned by the regional Bell companies, which willmake so-called Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)service available nationwide by next year.</LP><TEXT>   Derided for years by industry insiders as &quot;InnovationsSubscribers Don't Need&quot; because of fuzzy standards andskeptical customers, ISDN is actually viewed by the phone andcomputer industries as the highway that will be needed todeliver advanced voice and data services in the future.Already, big companies such as McDonald's Corp. and AmericanExpress Co. are using private networks with ISDN features,including multiple high-speed voice and data channels runningthrough a single phone wire.   Benefits of such a system include lower construction andmaintenance costs, since customers could use existing phonewiring to receive sophisticated ISDN services. ISDN couldalso make modems obsolete, as customers will have directaccess to a data channel at the push of a button. Andcomputer imaging services through the phone network wouldalso be possible with ISDN, laying the groundwork for futuredelivery of cable television signals.   &quot;These companies have made a big commitment to makecapital investments in ISDN, to build products in largevolumes for the mass market and to use these products,&quot; saidLeslie Fraser, ISDN project manager at the Corporation forOpen Systems. &quot;By the fall of 1992 there will be completeISDN service available to most of the country.&quot;   Corporation for Open Systems members include InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,General Motors Corp., the regional Bell companies, NorthernTelecom Ltd. and Digital Equipment Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
