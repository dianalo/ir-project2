Some oil-industry analysts estimate the potential reservesin Kazakhstan to be about 97 billion barrels, or roughly theequivalent of Kuwait. They estimate Elf's exploration therecould quickly increase its reserves by 20% to about fourbillion barrels.</LP><TEXT>   Elf said it plans to &quot;invest several hundred milliondollars for exploration&quot; and expects production to begin inabout 1995. Analysts put the exploration figure at between$600 million and $800 million, and some believe productioncould begin a year sooner than forecast by Elf.   If successful, Elf's Kazakhstan venture may &quot;put aneffective lid on oil prices world-wide by the mid-1990s,&quot;said Norman Higby, an oil-industry consultant based in MenloPark, Calif.   Moreover, Elf's pact may enable it to elbow past ChevronCorp., which had been negotiating with officials of theformer Soviet Union and in Kazakhstan for a joint venture inthe region of the Caspian Sea. A Chevron spokeswoman said thecompany is still negotiating with Kazakhstan officials. &quot;Wefeel very confident. The proposed deal is alive and well,&quot;she said, adding that the company &quot;expects to hear somethingin the next four to six weeks.&quot;   Its stock was quoted at $61.625 a share, down $2.125,while Elf's American depositary shares were $32.75, up 25cents, both in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   Chevron, based in San Francisco, said in its 1990 annualreport it hoped to begin production in 1991. Then came thefailed Soviet coup last August, slowing the negotiations ofseemingly every Western oil major except Elf, which stoppedits talks for only two days.   Elf, which earlier this month signed a similar agreementwith the Russian republic, said the Kazakhstan pact covers anexploration area of about 12,500 square miles -- about thesame as in Russia. Elf's Kazakhstan block is locatedsouthwest of the city of Aktyubinsk.   Yet an Elf spokesman wasn't immediately certain how thecompany will get its oil out of Kazakhstan; the closestpipeline hookup to a seaport may well be 300 miles to thewest. &quot;It's virgin territory,&quot; he said, adding that Elf'sblock hasn't been explored by Kazakhstan engineers. And to besure, political uncertainties complicate everything in theformer Soviet Union.   As an example of the reign of confusion, in late January aconsortium of Mitsui andamp; Co. of Japan, Marathon Oil Co. andMcDermott International Inc. of the U.S. had been chosen toconduct feasibility studies of hydrocarbon deposits offSakhalin island, in what appeared to be the largestindustrial project with the newly independent Russia. Thecontract has the potential to become a multibillion-dollarproject. But last week, the Supreme Council of the RussianFederation said it set up a committee to re-examine theaward, amid indications that there was some disagreementbetween local and central Russian governments over thecontract.   It wasn't immediately clear whether Elf's pact will havean effect on negotiations by Chevron and other companies togain footholds in Kazakhstan. But analysts said Elf's move isalmost certain to raise the entry costs for companies thatfollow, in that Kazakhstan officials will have gainedbargaining experience and probably won't feel compelled togrant as many incentives, now that they have one majorcompany's commitment.   Elf, based in Paris, is 53.9%-owned by the Frenchgovernment. It's one of the few major companies that producesas much oil as it uses. Elf's reputation as a proven producermay spur U.S. companies, cautious up to now, into pursuingventures in the republics of the former Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
