That, at least, is the view of OPEC's Secretary-GeneralSubroto, who said here yesterday that last month's decisionby the oil ministers to cut production in the second quarterby as much as one million barrels a day already is beginningto have an impact.</LP><TEXT>   Citing earlier &quot;doomsday forecasts&quot; of oil prices droppingto $5 or $6 a barrel in the second quarter when demand isseasonally weak, Mr. Subroto noted, instead, that prices areholding relatively steady. &quot;We see prices stabilizing,&quot; at$18 to $18.50 a barrel for North Sea Brent and around $19 or$20 for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, hesaid.   In an interview, Mr. Subroto said that he expects theaverage price for the OPEC basket of crudes to remain aroundthe current level of $17.50 a barrel. &quot;It will hold for thesecond quarter,&quot; he said.   Mr. Subroto was in Dallas for a breakfast meetingsponsored by the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man andfor a luncheon address at the annual convention of theAmerican Association of Petroleum Geologists.   In his talks, the former oil minister of Indonesia notedthat the goal of OPEC's March agreement wasn't to try to pushup oil prices. &quot;The intention was to provide a safety net&quot; byreducing output so that prices wouldn't fall further, hesaid.   Mr. Subroto suggested that a second-quarter productionlevel of 22.3 million to 22.5 million barrels a day -- OPEC'starget after the voluntary cutbacks from March output of some23.4 million a day -- should lead to more of a balance inpetroleum supply and demand. &quot;And if independent producersfollow OPEC's example,&quot; he added, &quot;we could see a movementtoward the realization of OPEC's target price of $21 a barrelby the end of the second quarter.&quot;   He said demand for OPEC oil should increase by around onemillion barrels a day in the third quarter and by two millionbarrels a day in the fourth quarter from the second-quarterlevel. &quot;My feeling is that $21 the reference price for theOPEC basket is certainly achievable in the second half of1991, maybe toward the end of the year,&quot; he said.   In the interview, Mr. Subroto said he doesn't haveestimates of production yet for April but that there aresigns output already has begun to drop toward the desiredlevel of 22.3 million to 22.5 million barrels a day. Outsidemonitors of OPEC's output agree, with some looking for it tofall even lower, to around 22 million.   On production, Mr. Subroto emphasized that neither Iraqnor Kuwait is likely to be able to resume exports in thesecond quarter. Indeed, a report in the widely respectedMiddle East Economic Survey yesterday called Iraq's prospectsfor renewing significant oil exports &quot;pretty slim&quot; because ofdamage inflicted on oil installations in the Gulf war. And inKuwait, where more than 500 oil wells were left burning bythe Iraqis when they withdrew, Mr. Subroto estimated that itwill be at least a year before significant production can bere-established.   In the longer term, said Mr. Subroto, OPEC is going toneed substantial financing help if it is to expand capacityto meet the estimated growth in demand for its oil. He citedprevious OPEC calculations that an increase in productioncapacity of five million barrels a day, over a five-yearperiod, would require investments amounting to $60 billion.But now, with the catastrophic damage to the oil facilitiesin Kuwait and Iraq, the funds needed will be considerablymore than that, he said.   &quot;A figure of $100 billion or more has been mentioned,&quot; hesaid. &quot;What I see in front of us will be a tightness ofsupply unless we are able to finance it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
