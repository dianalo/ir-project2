Among countries criticized for not giving more muscle tofinancial sanctions was Canada, whose External Affairs Minister JoeClark chaired the meeting of the Commonwealth Committee on SouthAfrica.   During the three-day meeting, which ended Wednesday, Clark toldfellow ministers he found trade figures reflecting a 44 percentincrease in Canadian exports to South Africa and 67 percent increasein imports from South Africa in 1988 ``very embarrassing.''   The foreign ministers, tasked by the 48-nation Commonwealth offormer British colonies to explore ways to toughen economicsanctions against South Africa, reviewed the terms of existing bansto plug loopholes, Clark told reporters.   He said he was not embarrassed by criticism at the meetingbecause his government approved a $504 million loan by the CanadianBank of Nova Scotia to a Luxembourg-based company owned 71 percentby South Africa's Oppenheimer family. Oppenheimers own the De Beersdiamond monopoly and a major stockholding in the South Africanmining and ranching conglomerate, Anglo American Corp.   Media reports said the Canadian loan was needed for Minorco's$4.4 billion takeover bid for London-based Consolidated Goldfields,which has substantial mining interests in South Africa.   Clark said the loan to the Luxembourg company Minorco did notbreach Canada's prohibition on investment in South Africa as it wasnot made to a South African-based company.   ``That action is in bounds,'' he said. ``In question now is theadequacy of the ban we have in place. We have to see if it reflectsthe intent of the Commonwealth.''   The meeting ending with several resolutions, including a call forworld financial institutions to deny loan and debt reschedulingfacilities to South Africa.   In a final statement, the ministers identified financialsanctions in world money markets as ``one of the most powerfulsources of pressure'' to force Pretoria to abandon its legal systemof racial separation, called apartheid.</TEXT></DOC>
