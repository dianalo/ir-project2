Gorman. I think youhave to look at the credibility of the attacker to determine thecredibility of the attack,'' said Gorman's lawyer, Hunter Lundy.   Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered alower court to hear Gorman's case against Swaggart, rejectingarguments that it was purely a church matter that didn't belong inthe courts.   The court said church doctrine requiring that charges againstGorman be published within the Assemblies of God denomination didnot protect members who spread the accusations outside the church.   Swaggart's lawyer, Phil Whittman, said he would appeal to thestate Supreme Court.   Gorman's lawsuit, filed over a year ago, claims Swaggart falselyaccused him of adulterous affairs in an effort to bring downGorman's television ministry. Gorman resigned from the Assembliesof God following the scandal. He admitted to a single adulterousencounter in 1979, but said Swaggart's other accusations ofadultery were lies.   Various sources have reported that earlier this year, Gormansent Assemblies of God leaders photographs of Swaggart outside asuburban New Orleans motel with a prostitute. A woman who laterclaimed to be that prostitute said Swaggart paid her to pose in thenude.   Lundy, while not saying what the photographs show, said he willdefinitely use them along with other evidence gathered by privatedetectives.   ``It now appears that we will get our day in court and all thefacts will be presented to a jury of our peers, and I know we willbe exonerated from the lies published about me, my family and myministry,'' Gorman said.   On Feb. 21, Swaggart confessed before his Baton Rougecongregation to an unspecified sins and stepped down from thepulpit. He said he would submit to the church's decree.   But he left the Pentecostal denomination after the Executive andGeneral presbyteries ordered a one-year suspension from the pulpitrather than the three-month one recommended by the LouisianaDistrict Council. He said he was not rebelling, but his ministryand Bible college could not afford for him to be out of the pulpitthat long.   Gorman said he had confronted Swaggart with his evidence inOctober and given him four months to make himself clean with thechurch before presenting the evidence against him.</TEXT></DOC>
