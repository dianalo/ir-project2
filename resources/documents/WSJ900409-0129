Perhaps all the president has to do is phone AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh and ask him to step outside hisoffice and into the halls of the Justice Department.   Late last month, on a trip to Washington, I found myselfat the Justice Department, about to attend a meeting a floorbelow Mr. Thornburgh's office. Upon entering the building,like all visitors, I provided some identification and statedthe purpose of the visit and the office at which I wasexpected. After those details were recorded and verified, Ipassed through a metal detector and my belongings werechecked by an X-ray machine. I completed the security checkand continued on my way to my meeting, in the firm beliefthat the building must be one of the most crime-free in thecapital.</LP><TEXT>   I was very tired that day and it must have showed. TheJustice Department headquarters is a rather large and complexbuilding, and it is easy to get lost in its long corridors.As I was rounding one corner, I saw packages and boxes out ofthe corner of my eye and a person who seemed to approach mefrom this area suddenly moved and blocked my way. Imagine myshock and surprise when this rather thin, casually dressedyoung man who appeared to be in his 20s said, &quot;Wanna fix?&quot; Iwas so startled, I stopped and stared. He repeated hisquestion while taking something out of his pocket and quicklyopened his palm revealing a small, shiny white square.Dumbfounded, I made no reply but instinctively moved out ofhis way and down the corridor to the first open doorway of anoffice suite seeking help.   As I walked outraged into the room, the full impact ofwhat had just happened dawned on me, and I said to the peoplein the office that somebody had tried to sell me drugs justoutside their office in the corridor. They didn't seemsurprised, nor shocked, nor did they feel impelled to doanything. Their response simply was, &quot;Really?&quot; When Isuggested that they check the corridor and see if he wasstill there, I got no response. They were not interested andwent on with their work as though nothing had happened. WhenI was able to get myself collected, I left their office andcontinued on my way.   Later I called the office responsible for security in theJustice Department and gave it the details of the incident.When I inquired if something like this had ever been reportedbefore, the answer was no. The security people, however, werevery anxious to take down the details of what had happened.   I suppose it is possible that I was the victim of a prank.But Bush administration officials have just admitted that thewar on drugs has been a failure in the streets of Washington.Perhaps it has failed in the corridors of power as well. Ifone can be offered drugs in the halls of the JusticeDepartment in Washington, it seems reasonable to suspect thatthe &quot;Colombianization&quot; of the U.S. is here now.   ---   Ms. Ehrenfeld is the author of &quot;Narco-Terrorism,&quot; to bepublished by Basic Books this fall, and a research scholar atNew York University School of Law.</TEXT></DOC>
