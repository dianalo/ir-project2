(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge today dismissed federalhostage-taking charges against Indian activist Timothy Jacobs, butsaid he would leave it to a jury to decide whether his fellowdefendant was guilty on that charge.   Four other charges against Jacobs still stood.   Attorneys for Jacobs on Friday had argued that prosecutors hadfailed to prove that he and Eddie Hatcher had made a demand on thefederal government during their takeover of The Robesoniannewspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1.   U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle said this morning thathis reading of the statute showed that a demand on the governmenthad to be ``not just incidental, but material.''   Up to 20 people were held hostage in the newspaper office for asmuch as 10 hours while the two defendants demanded an investigationinto what they said was local corruption and racial discrimination.No one was injured.   Boyle said prosecutors had presented no evidence that Jacobs hadmade a demand or had aided Hatcher in making a demand to thefederal government. In Hatcher's case, though, he said the juryshould decide the question. Testimony had indicated that Hatcherdid most of the talking during the incident.   The hostage-taking charge was linked with a second charge ofcommitting a violent crime with an illegal firearm. Boyle alsodismissed that charge against Jacobs.   Jacobs still faces charges of conspiracy, making an illegalfirearm, possessing an unregistered firearm and conveying falseinformation concerning explosives.   In his ruling today, Boyle also indicated he would not accept a``necessity defense'' for the two defendants because there was nodirect relationship between the hostages taken at the Robesonianand the threats perceived by the two.   The two defendants had argued that their lives were in jeopardybecause of information they had allegedly linking law enforcementofficers to drug trafficking in Robeson County. They claimed theyhad no choice but to take hostages at the newspaper to publicizetheir case and save their lives.   Last week, defense attorney Lewis Pitts had argued for dismissalof the hostage charge against Jacobs, saying that ``there isabsolutely no proof as to Timmy Jacobs making a demand on thefederal government.''   Pitts argued that the federal hostage-taking law was designed todeal with international seizures and that Congress had specificallywanted strict limits on its use in domestic cases.   ``What may have been done may have been conspicuously a crime,but the question is whether it's a criminal matter against theUnited States,'' Boyle had said Friday.   ``It appears we have here a situation that the evidence appearsto show was a locally generated grievance,'' Boyle said. ``It arosein Robeson County and it had to do with matters in Robeson County.The demand (on the federal government) arose from a demand forstate action _ a special prosecutor _ which state law apparentlydid not allow.''   The federal prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, hadargued that the federal charges were relevant because the two askedto surrender to FBI agents and included in their written list ofdemands a requirement for a federal investigation in Robeson County.</TEXT></DOC>
