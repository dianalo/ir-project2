The stock drop followed a conference call with analystsyesterday in which Reebok officials disclosed that orders aredown for the Pump line of shoes.</LP><TEXT>   Following the conference call, Gary Jacobson, a KidderPeabody analyst, reduced his &quot;buy&quot; rating on the Stoughton,Mass., concern's stock to &quot;hold.&quot; The change was &quot;primarilydue to price appreciation and valuation&quot; of the stock overtime, he said. Reebok's stock has risen about 250% this yearand is near its historical high, he added. A general&quot;softening of Reebok's business&quot; and &quot;disappointing retailsales in general&quot; also helped prompt the change, Mr. Jacobsonsaid.   In late New York Stock Exchange composite tradingyesterday, Reebok was trading at $30, down $3.875.   Despite the stock drop, Reebok's strong third-quarterearnings prompted some analysts to raise their estimates ofits 1991 net income. Kidder Peabody's Mr. Jacobson said heboosted his 1991 estimate to $2.30 a share from $2.25 and his1992 estimate to $2.70 a share from $2.60. In 1990, Reebokearned $1.54 a share.   While advance bookings for the Pump line are down 30% forthe 1992 first quarter, &quot;we certainly don't see the Pump as amature market,&quot; said Paul Duncan, vice president, finance. Headded that several new shoes incorporating the Pump mechanismwill soon be introduced. Pump shoes will contribute anestimated 7% of Reebok's 1991 sales.   Mr. Duncan attributed Reebok's stock drop to profit-takingfollowing the strong rise in its price this year.   &quot;My retail sources inform me that sales of the Pump haveslowed considerably,&quot; said Jennifer Black Groves, a fashionretail analyst for Black andamp; Co., a brokerage firm in Portland,Ore. &quot;In fact, one retail buyer says he can't even give themaway and questions the longevity of the line's {popularity.}&quot;   Reebok reported that net income rose to $66.2 million, or71 cents a share, from $41 million, or 36 cents a share, ayear earlier. Per-share earnings rose faster than net becauseReebok bought back 24.5 million common shares from PentlandGroup PLC in April. At the end of the quarter, Reebok had93.1 million shares outstanding, compared with 114.6 milliona year earlier.   Heidi Steinberg, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, notedthat the large percentage rise in Reebok's earnings was duepartly to the latest quarter's comparison with relativelypoor year-earlier earnings, which were down 18%. Still, shehad estimated Reebok would earn only 61 cents a share for thelatest quarter. &quot;And I think that was on the higher end ofestimates,&quot; she added.   Reebok said that during the quarter, its U.S. footwearsales rose 24% from a year earlier to $373.6 million. Thecompany added that its international division &quot;continuedstrong growth despite a softening of sales in England andCanada as a result of poor economic conditions.&quot;International sales were $232.2 million, compared with $138.7million a year earlier.   Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer, saidthe company is &quot;continuing to exercise caution due touncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and other markets.&quot;   For the nine months, Reebok's earnings rose 35% to $185million, or $1.82 a share, from $137.1 million, or $1.20 ashare, a year earlier. Sales were up 29% to $2.15 billionfrom $1.67 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
