 The Macneeded a TCP/IP connection to gain high-speed access to the network thatprovides supercomputing time to scientists at about 200 universities andresearch institutes.andP;  Without it, supercomputing access was limited to asuper-slow 2,400-bps modem connection.andM;&quot;We went to Apple and said, 'We love the Mac, but where's your TCP/IPinterface?' &quot; said Brand Fortner, manager of application software at theNational Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champaign.andP;  &quot;Apple officials responded with blank stares.&quot;andM;NCSA programmers ultimately wrote their own software for their Macs tointerface with TCP/IP, the standard networking protocol for technical andacademic computing systems.andP;  And Apple has finally rectified the situation byadding TCP/IP drivers to the Mac.andP;  But NCSA's integration of the Mac into ascientific computing environment demonstrates how the Mac can mount anincursion into territory once deemed the exclusive turf of more-powerfulscientific workstations such as those from Sun Microsystems and DigitalEquipment Corp.andM;Further, NCSA's efforts in building the Mac into a premier scientificworkstation illustrate how high-speed connectivity to mainframe systems canovercome lack of processing power, thus helping the Mac adapt to even themost-rigorous computing environments.andM;NCSA is one of the National Science Foundation's six government-fundedsupercomputer centers and functions as the support organization for more than2,000 network users.andP;  NCSA is funded by both federal and state taxes as wellas grants from private industry, including grants from both Apple and CrayResearch.andP;  NCSA's mission is to help scientists more effectively usesupercomputer resources by developing software and offering training andother support services.andP;  All software developed by NCSA becomes part of thepublic domain.andM;The idea for the supercomputing system came in a 1982 proposal fromUniversity of Illinois physics and astronomy Professor Larry Smarr.andP;  Now NCSAdirector, Smarr had found it virtually impossible to obtain thesupercomputing processing time necessary to conduct his research.andP;  Withuniversity mainframes devoting most of their horsepower to administrativetasks, researchers scrambling for supercomputing time had to face thebureaucratic nightmare of obtaining security clearance to government systemsor go to foreign countries like West Germany.andM;When the supercomputing system became a reality in 1985, NCSA softwaredevelopers and research scientists quickly dubbed the Mac their workstationof choice for the supercomputer system.andM;&quot;The Macintosh is a wonderful machine for scientists to use because of itsgraphics and the ability to cut and paste research data into reports,&quot; saidFortner.andP;  &quot;In 1985, IBM donated 30 [PC] ATs, and Apple gave us 12 Lisas andsome Mac 512Ks.andP;  Today, we still have only about 30 ATs, but now we have morethan 200 Mac IIs.&quot;andM;Graphics are essential for scientists running supercomputer applications.andO;Researchers need the speed of the supercomputer to crunch and analyzenumerical models that may contain more than a gigabyte of data.andP;  But becausethe models are so huge, scanning a numerical printout to discover whathappens when two black holes collide, for example, would be meaningless.andO;Only when the numbers can be translated to a visual format can scientiststruly comprehend their research.andM;Further, the NCSA support team wanted to champion an easy-to-use,cost-effective workstation for research scientists.andM;&quot;We have more than 60 Sun workstations at NCSA, but the Suns present arelatively hostile and technical environment to the average scientist,&quot; saidFortner.andP;  &quot;And the Suns don't offer the other productivity tools scientistsneed, such as word processing and spreadsheet software.&quot;andM;But enthusiasm for the Macintosh couldn't mask its lack of raw processingpower when stacked against the Sun workstation.andP;  NCSA chose to solve theMac's horse-power deficiency by ignoring it.andM;&quot;There is no desktop system that has the ability to crunch some of thenumerical models with which researchers are working,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;We tookthe approach that if you have a high-speed link to a supercomputer on yourdesk, then you don't need the raw processing power.&quot;andM;To make the Mac work in a supercomputer environment, therefore, NCSAdevelopers had to first build a high-speed link between the supercomputer andthe Mac, then provide scientists with software tools to manage and visualizetheir data on the Mac system.andM;The NCSA network on the university campus includes nine Ethernet LANs hookedto a Proteon fiber-optic backbone and TCP/IP gateways to the university'sCray X-MP and Cray II supercomputers.andP;  The campus network, in turn, isconnected via T-1 digital links to NSFNET, the National Science Foundation'sscientific data network linking other supercomputer sites and researchinstitutes across the country.andM;&quot;When we decided to integrate Macs into the network, there was already anEthernet connection for IBM PCs and Sun work-stations but only dial-up accessfor the Macs,&quot; said Tim Krauskopf, design lead for NCSA's softwaredevelopment group.andP;  &quot;There was a crying need for the Mac to run at Ethernetspeeds.&quot;andM;All of the Macs at NCSA either have an EtherTalk card or use the GatorBoxfrom Cayman Systems or Kinetics FastPath from the Kinetics division ofExcelan (now part of Novell) as gateways between AppleTalk and the Ethernetnetwork.andP;  But while a hardware connection between the Macs and Ethernet wasavailable, a true gateway to the supercomputing network didn't exist withoutcommunications software incorporating TCP/IP protocols.andM;As a result, the first application developed by the center was NCSA Telnet,public-domain software that lets scientists move data between the Mac and anyother computer on a TCP/IP Ethernet network.andM;With the Macs hooked to Ethernet, scientists can use the Cray supercomputers,DEC VAXes, Suns or the university's Alliant FX/8 to crunch numbers andanalyze numerical data.andP;  Another NCSA software product, NCSA HDF(Hierarchical Data Format) facilitates the sharing of data across allmachines and systems on the network without the need for any file conversion.andO;And NCSA HDF lets scientists set up disk storage space on the Cray systems,in many cases eliminating the need for high-capacity disk drives.andM;Once computations have been made on more-powerful systems, scientists can usea palette of NCSA software tools to visualize the data on the Mac.andM;&quot;The concept behind our visualization software can best be described as paintby numbers,&quot; explained Krauskopf.andP;  &quot;The software takes a set of numbers andassigns a color to it.&quot;andM;The Mac II represented a breakthrough in model visualization because itoffered programmers 256 colors with which to work.andM;&quot;As soon as the Mac II was introduced, we set up a visualization and imaginggroup,&quot; Krauskopf said.andP;  &quot;With 256 colors, we were able to create a suite ofvisualization tools.&quot;andM;NCSA Image for the Mac II, for example, allows scientists to display 2-D datain a video format by, in essence, displaying snapshots of the data as itchanges over time.andP;  By taking numerical calculations of pressure changes in ahurricane, assigning colors to the numbers and displaying the results everyfew seconds, scientists can create a moving color picture of a hurricane ontheir Mac IIs.andP;  And with NCSA Layout, they can create a color slide of thestorm.andM;While NCSA staffers have worked to shore up gaps in the Mac to make it workas a scientific workstation, third-party software vendors have contributedother missing pieces, such as a Fortran compiler from Language Systems Corp.andO;of Herndon, Va.andM;&quot;Almost all the models used by scientists are written in Fortran,&quot; saidKrauskopf.andP;  &quot;With a Fortran compiler for the Mac, scientists can write theirown programs at their desk.&quot;andM;Apple is still missing an Ethernet interface between LaserWriter printers,forcing NCSA to run AppleTalk in parallel with Ethernet to share laserprinters.andP;  But overall the Mac's hand as a scientific workstation continuesto strengthen, Krauskopf said.andM;&quot;The most encouraging thing is that with all its recent connectivityannouncements, Apple realizes that the Mac is no longer an island,&quot; he said.andM;The strategy of using a high bandwidth to compensate for lack of CPU powermay work for other organizations that like the Mac interface but think theyneed the speed of a more powerful workstation.andP;  Missing from the Macequation, however, is a true multi-user environment necessary in somestringent computing applications.andP;  A/UX, Apple's version of Unix, may yetplug the gap, but so far the lack of a multi-user system has not hamperedNational Science Foundation supercomputer users.andM;Because most scientists conduct research as individuals or as small groups,the need for a multi-user system isn't as crucial.andP;  NCSA Telnet allowsscientists to conduct multiple sessions to multiple computers.andP;  Fortner, forexample, says he can be running data analysis on the Cray while he usesMultiFinder to check his electronic mail running on a Sun.andM;&quot;The Mac doesn't have a multi-user operating system or raw CPU power, but itworks fine for us,&quot; said Fortner.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
