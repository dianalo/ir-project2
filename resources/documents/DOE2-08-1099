Applicable regulations,industry standards, and technical guidance on low-level radioactive wasteare noted throughout the document. In the preoperational phase, the applicantmust demonstrate that the environmental monitoring program identifiesradiation levels and radionuclide concentrations at the site and alsoprovides adequate basic data on the disposal site. Data recording andstatistical analyses for this phase are addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
