This reactor, designed for a 25-year life, is under studyto determine the possibility of significantly extending the operatinglife. One limiting factor is dimensional growth of the graphite latticemaking up the core of the reactor. Since the original demands (25-yearlife) were modest, the dimensional change behavior was derived from acompendium of irradiation data from other grades and only confirmed bya few low-exposure irradiation experiments. Therefore, to generate actualdimensional change data for grade TSX to exposures relevant to the lifeextension plans, a series of irradiations of TSX graphite were run inthe High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge. This report containsexperimental results of such testing. 5 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
