Les Aspin (D., Wis.) stated that he wants the Stealth bomber opened up to competition without explaining how this might save the taxpayer money. Given the large investment required for tooling and the start-up costs involved, it defies common sense that having two manufacturers split the production of an average of 15 to 20 aircraft a year will be cost effective. This sort of irresponsible competition-at-any-cost mind-set should be discouraged. The Navy's misuse of this contracting policy will lead to cost overruns of $1.2 billion over the next four years, according to the General Accounting Office. It is bound to add millions to the cost of each Stealth bomber.    Robert D. Kugel   Aerospace Analyst   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    New York</TEXT></DOC>
