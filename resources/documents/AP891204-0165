At Monday's session, the Soviet Union and Pact members Bulgaria,Hungary, East Germany and Poland condemned their own action ininvading Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform movement.   The Soviet news agency Tass also said the Kremlin and Praguewill begin talks on possible reduction of Soviet troops still basedin Czechoslovakia.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated at the meetingthat the Warsaw Pact and its Western opponent, the North AtlanticTreaty Organization, will someday become political rather thanmilitary alliances.   For leaders of four of the seven nations, it was their firstmeeting, underscoring how quickly old guard Communists have beenswept from power. They heard Gorbachev report on his Malta summitwith President Bush.   Erstwhile diplomatic cover for the Kremlin's ideologicalpolicing of its allies, the seven-member pact faces unprecedentedpluralism, from its first non-Communist head of government, PolishPremier Tadeusz Mazowiecki, to Romania's hard-line Communist leaderNicolae Ceausescu.   Somehow, those men must agree on Eastern Europe's future anddefense policy if the Warsaw Pact is to be an alliance in anythingbut name. Chastened by past interventions in their countries'lives, some reformers now in power also want guarantees that thepact's armed might will not be turned on them.   Having already ceased to make ideological demands on its allies,the Warsaw Pact should ``stay out'' of member nations' politicsaltogether, said Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary, wherelegal groundwork was laid this fall for democratic, multipartyelections.   Horn's fears are not baseless: In mid-August, the Romaniansreportedly requested joint Warsaw Pact action against Poland topreserve Communist Party rule.   In fact, under Gorbachev, the Soviets appear ready to acceptvirtually any sort of political change in Eastern Europe, providedallegiance is unshaken to the defense treaty written in 1955 at atime of tight, sometimes violent Kremlin domination.   ``All the reforms which no one could have imagined a few yearsago will be accepted in Moscow, unless they lead to the questioningof membership in the Warsaw Pact,'' the Polish newspaper ZycieWarszawy commented recently.   Intriguingly, recent Soviet pronouncements indicate the Kremlinenvisons the pact's future in a blurring of functions with theCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance, or COMECON, the notoriouslyineffective socialist trade bloc that includes all Warsaw Pactmembers.   In October, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze saidthe Kremlin would be interested in negotiating the abolition ofboth NATO and the Warsaw Pact by the year 2000, as part of theKremlin campaign to create a ``common European home.'' But later,in an interview with the official Polish news agency PAP,Shevardnadze noted:   ``For the time being, the two alliances do exist and one shouldaim for their gradually being transformed into political-militaryorganizations through developing civilian trends of their activitywith a simultaneous reduction of all military elements.''   What East bloc military leaders, traditionally subservient totheir parties, think of such notions is unknown, but Warsaw Pactdefense ministers sounded an apparent note of discord at a meetingin Hungary on Nov. 27-29 by highlighting the NATO ``threat.''   ``The military budgets and long-term development programs of thearmed forces of the United States and other NATO countries stillaim to preserve military might as the chief tool of attaining theirforeign policy objectives,'' the ministers said in a communique.   According to NATO figures, the Warsaw Pact has 3 millionfull-time military personnel, compared with 2.2 million for theWestern alliance. Pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity:3.6 million for NATO and 3.5 million for the East bloc.   The ``Agreement on Friendship, Coordination and MutualAssistance'' was signed May 14, 1955, in Warsaw by the SovietUnion, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,Poland and Romania. The treaty was in effect a response to theadmission of West Germany to NATO 10 days earlier.   The pact provided the machinery by which the Soviets couldcontrol the Eastern European military, transmit foreign policyguidelines to their satellites and exercise political controlthroughout the ``cordon sanitaire'' to their west.   The treaty was used as a legal screen for military interventionsnow condemned by Eastern Europe's reform governments. In 1956,revolt broke out in Hungary when the government demanded thewithdrawal of Soviet troops and stated its intention to leave thepact to become a neutral country. Soviets troops crushed the revoltand installed a new leadership.   Alexander Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakiaalso were snuffed out when Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks invaded in1968 to restore a Moscow-aligned government. Soviet leader LeonidI. Brezhnev said the alliance had the ``sacred duty'' to protectsocialism wherever it was threatened.   That assertion, which became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, hasbeen repudiated by Gorbachev. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.Gerasimov jocularly noted the Kremlin now practices ``the SinatraDoctrine,'' named for Frank Sinatra's trademark song ``My Way,'' byletting each of its allies do things ``its way.''   Some disagreement with Moscow was allowed in the past. TheCommunist hermit state of Albania formally pulled out of the pactto protest the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1958, Romaniawithdrew from its agreement to permit stationing of Soviet troopson its soil, and ceased to take part in Warsaw Pact militaryexercises.   Moscow's allies also balked when the Soviets, in 1956-7 and1967-8, tried to form a standing Warsaw Pact army. They fearedtheir troops might be deployed to support purely Soviet adventures,for example on the Chinese border.   Nevertheless, 34 years after its creation, the Warsaw Pact'smachinery remains dominated at all levels by Soviets. In February,Gen. Pyotr Lushev, a first deputy defense minister, replacedanother Soviet, Marshal Viktor Kulikov, as alliance commander.</TEXT></DOC>
