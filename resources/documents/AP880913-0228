Hersecond is on the way. Now the judge who controls her fate hasproposed an unorthodox solution to her troubled life _sterilization.   The proposal has thrust the expectant mother into a thorny legaldebate over crime and punishment and whether the courts are playingGod or protecting society.   An outcry arose after Judge Roy Jones suggested he might be morelenient if Miss Baldwin were sterilized before he sentences her forfeeding her 4-year-old son, Joshua, fatal doses of psychiatricdrugs prescribed for her.   ``She is a person who no longer needs to ever have anychildren,'' Jones said. If she becomes a mother again, he warned,``the possibility is there for the same thing to happen.''   Miss Baldwin, due to give birth late this month, has signed aconsent form agreeing to sterilization, her attorney says. But herprospect of trading motherhood for a reduced prison term hasoutraged civil libertarians, feminists and the county prosecutorwho say Jones' proposal would deny her a most fundamental right.   ``I don't think it's appropriate for the court deciding whoshould have a child and who shouldn't,'' said Richard Waples, legaldirector of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. ``You're authorizinga decision on reproductive capabilities that is dangerously closeto eugenics (a form of selective breeding). That's something thatis foreign to our system and beliefs about the sanctity of humanlife and the limited power of the state.''   ``It reminds me of the Islamic punishment of cutting off a handfor theft,'' said lawyer Pequita Buis, state legislativecoordinator for the National Organization for Women. ``We don'tengage in physical mutilation for punishment in this country.''   Jones insists his proposal isn't punitive or inconsistent withNOW tenets.   ``They are the biggest advocates I am aware of how a womanshould have the right to control her own body,'' he said. ``All Isuggested to Miss Baldwin is that she in fact think about that _ dosomething to control her own body.''   Miss Baldwin, who has told her attorney she will surrender herbaby for adoption, pleaded guilty in June to neglect of a dependent_ giving her son drugs _ after the state agreed to drop murdercharges.   Shortly afterwards, Miss Baldwin, then six months' pregnant, washospitalized for weight loss. She's since been moved to apsychiatric ward, awaiting the prospect of six to 20 years inprison.   Jones says if Miss Baldwin rejects sterilization, it won't hurther in court; if she agrees, he says, it could ease mental pressureand be a mitigating factor.   Her attorney, Michael Donahoe, says he doesn't think his clientshould become a mother again because she ``doesn't seem to bementally, financially or legally in a position to raise a child ina responsible way.''   But Donahoe says he fears that if she is sterilized, ``heralready low self-esteem would be reduced almost to nothing.''   The ethical and legal questions raised in this case havesurfaced elsewhere where court rulings have touched on the mostintimate aspects of life.   This month, an Arizona judge reversed her order requiring an18-year-old mother to practice birth control throughout herchildbearing years after she left two infant sons alone in asweltering apartment for three days. The judge said the order wasunenforceable because of the fallibility of birth control; thewoman is pregnant again.   In 1985, three convicted rapists in South Carolina wereresentenced after the state Supreme Court said a judge's decisionto let them choose castration over prison violated safeguardsagainst cruel and unusual punishment.   And in Michigan in 1986, the state Supreme Court upheld a5-to-15-year prison term imposed on Upjohn Co. heir Roger Gauntlettin place of the ``chemical castration'' originally levied after hepleaded no contest to raping a 14-year-old stepdaughter.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
