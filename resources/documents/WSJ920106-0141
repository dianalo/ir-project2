At Prudential Securities, a powerful parallelsupercomputer gives quick risk analysis for mortgage-backedsecurities, while clients are on the line. Previously, theanalysis took several minutes on conventional computers --too long to keep clients on the phone, and long enough formarket prices to change, sometimes rendering the analysisobsolete.   Now, with parallel machines -- which use dozens, or evenhundreds, of processors working on different aspects of aproblem at the same time -- customers get answers in aslittle as 30 seconds. Parallel processors, which can rangefrom $300,000 to $3 million, offer supercomputer power at farless cost. They provide a clear strategic advantage overtraditional systems, says David Audley, research director forPrudential's financial strategies group, which has used anIntel parallel machine for about a year.   Indeed, with increasingly arcane derivative securitiesrequiring time-sensitive computations, supercomputer-classhorsepower may become a cost of doing business forfinancial-services companies, says George Lindamood, aconsultant with market researcher Gartner Group.   Other emerging markets include credit-card companies andretailers. American Express just bought two Thinking Machinescomputers for its travel-services operation, while Kmart isusing a Teradata parallel computer to coax new salesstrategies from the mountain of transaction informationcollected by all of its stores each day.   Kmart had long noted that some stores sold lots ofconfetti around Easter. The parallel machine analyzed salesdata and other information for every store and pinpointed thereason: Confetti sells best in or near Hispanicneighborhoods, where it is used in traditional holidaycelebrations.                                                                                                          U.S. Bobsled Drivers   Take Simulated Ride                                                                                                          MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., a sunny Silicon Valley city, mightnot seem the best place for the U.S. Olympic bobsled team totrain. But the team's drivers will be there today to practiceon a computer simulation of the Olympic bobsled run in LaPlagne, France, for next month's games.   With the margin of victory in this high-speed eventmeasured in hundredths of seconds, familiarity with the runcould give the U.S. team an edge. So every twist and turn ofthe mile-long course has been recreated on a computersimulator by researchers at the University of California atDavis working with Silicon Graphics of Mountain View.   Team members will pilot an actual bobsled whose steeringcontrol is connected to a powerful computer, which projects alifesized, three-dimensional simulation of the course on ascreen in front of the sled. Every tug at the steering isinstantly reflected in the simulation, which projects thesled's flight down the icy track by calculating aerodynamics,gravity, friction, steering and weight 30 times a second. Therun takes about a minute to complete.   &quot;You can see your mistakes without crashing,&quot; says RandyWill, a driver on the U.S. team who took a trial run Friday.&quot;We were skeptical at first, but the visual aspect is veryreal. All that's missing is the cold.&quot;                                                                                                          Vanishing Ink Stymies   Invisible Bar Codes                                                                                                          INVISIBLE bar-code technology might already be on themarket, but for the problem of disappearing ink.   Researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute developed thenew bar-code technology for the U.S. Postal Service -- whichuses bar codes to automate letter-sorting -- and licensed itlast year to AccuSort Systems, a bar-code equipment companyin Telford, Pa. Accu-Sort envisions all kinds of potentialuses, including on cash, ID cards and passports to preventcounterfeiting. In law enforcement, detectives could use theinvisible bar codes on cash to track the flow of moneyfollowing an illegal transaction.   The problem is the invisible ink, which after a few weeksbecomes invisible even to the infrared photocell designed toread it, an Accu-Sort researcher says. &quot;There are still sometechnical hurdles, but we expect to get it worked out soon,&quot;says Michael Hrabina of Accu-Sort.                                                                                                          Tiny Electronics Help   Give Life to Microrobots                                                                                                          SILICON &quot;ants&quot; might one day sweep up radioactive dustfrom hard-to-reach laboratory corners, purge diseased cellsfrom blood or even be used by spies to bug a room.   Such microrobots are becoming feasible with advancedmaterials and microscopic electronics. For his ant, inventorJohannes G. Smits of Boston University has devisedmicromotors three millimeters long and the width of a humanhair to drive the tiny machine's legs and pincer. The motorswork without gears: Chromium-gold electrodes under varyingelectric charges cause zinc oxide coatings on tiny siliconrods to expand and contract, in turn making the rods move.   The ant would walk as its electrically charged siliconlegs flex up and down, and its pincer would work the sameway. The device, still under development, would be powered bya solar cell and controlled by a microprocessor brainresponding to acoustic signals.   Prof. Smits, who recently received a patent for the antdesign, says other micromotor designs usually depend on tinygears turning in response to rapidly changing electricalfields. But such moving parts can get clogged with dust andare more likely to break down, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
