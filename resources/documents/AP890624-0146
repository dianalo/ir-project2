The London newspaper quoted a Lebanese-born French citizen, whohelped negotiate the release of French hostages, as saying Iranholds the key to the release of foreign hostages and that Iranianleaders want contacts with the West.   ``All that is required is for Mrs. (Prime Minister Margaret)Thatcher to send people to Tehran to tell the Iranian leaders: `Ifyou release our hostages, we will start talks about reopeningdiplomatic relations,' the paper quoted Dr. Razah Raad as saying.   ``This should be followed up by a humanitarian gesture, such assending a ship with medical supplies and nursing volunteers torelieve the terrible suffering of Iranian victims of the war,'' hewas quoted as saying.   A cease-fire last August brought an end to the fighting betweenIran and Iraq that began in September 1980 over border conflicts.   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held bypro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan. Keenan, a nativeof Belfast, Northern Ireland, has dual British and Irish nationality.   A fourth Briton, Jack Mann, a 75-year-old former pilot,disappeared in Beirut on May 12. A terrorist group, the Cells ofArmed Struggle, claimed in a statement the same day that theykidnapped a Briton but gave no name.   Nine Americans are among at least 14 foreign hostages kidnappedin Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, Has been held the longest. He was abducted March6, 1985.   The Sunday Express, who called Raad a ``leading hostagenegotiator,'' did not say when it interviewed him.   Raad has been credited by French authorities as helping winfreedom for some French hostages. The French Foreign Ministry firstsent him to Lebanon in November 1985 to try to negotiate thecaptives' release.</TEXT></DOC>
