Yet the maker of educational laboratory equipment isanxious about the move.   &quot;We're a small company with limited resources,&quot; saysGerard Ezcurra, director of the Roseville, Calif., concern'sinternational-business division. &quot;We can't afford it if thething goes belly up.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Pasco Scientific is wrestling with a crucial and difficultproblem that many small businesses face these days: choosingthe right manager for an overseas venture. Should the companytransfer a headquarters manager or recruit someone overseasto run the new operation? Moving an American executive toBritain would cost plenty, but would give Pasco Scientific awell-known quantity. A local foreign national would bringextensive knowledge of the market, but scant understanding ofthe company's products.   More small companies than ever must weigh such trade-offsas they expand internationally, especially to offset weakdomestic demand. Among 2,200 smaller businesses surveyed byconsultants BDO Seidman, 45% said they exported goods in1991, up from 36% a year earlier. In record numbers, suchcompanies also are establishing operations overseas.   &quot;Small companies that once would not have dreamed ofoperating on a global basis are moving very quickly toestablish foreign offices by hiring somebody locally orsending over an expatriate,&quot; says Roger Herod, a vicepresident of consultants Organization Resources Counselors inChicago.   Small companies getting started overseas obviously lackin-house international experience and are particularlyvulnerable to mistakes. Besides, some &quot;are making decisionshastily without doing their homework,&quot; Mr. Herod says.   It's easy to underestimate, for instance, a foreigner'sreluctance to join a small and little-known U.S. firm. MDAScientific Inc., a Lincolnshire, Ill., maker of toxic-gasmonitors, has found that out since opening a sales office inTokyo last year.   &quot;We're finding it's very difficult to hire people there,&quot;says Mark Sztelle, an MDA vice president. &quot;A lot of peopledon't want to take the risk of starting with a small firmthat has no track record to speak of. If we were Coca-Cola orsome other brand name, it would be a lot easier.&quot;   MDA continues to hunt for a Japanese sales executive. Butit has given up hopes of finding a local service technician,and instead will transfer an MDA technician from the U.S.   When a small firm does line up promising foreigncandidates for its international office, picking the rightone can require that the chief executive fly overseas.   Ian Davison, founder, chairman and chief executive officerof Octocom Systems Inc., a Chelmsford, Mass., producer ofcommunications networking equipment, felt that he had tointerview each foreign national who now runs Octocom'soffices in Britain, France and Australia. &quot;It's not somethingI believe can be delegated,&quot; Mr. Davison explains. At a smallcompany, &quot;there's too much responsibility and money atissue.&quot;   Yet even with a chief executive personally involved, aninexperienced small business still may choose the wrongforeign candidate. &quot;Small companies can't always identify theright person, because they don't know the right questions toask,&quot; says Robert Wingerter, a partner in Ernst andamp; Young'sIndianapolis office. For instance, does a candidate withstrong selling skills also have knowledge of the market andthe product to be sold?   Smaller firms also may fail to grasp the legalconsequences of hiring a foreign national. Labor laws in manyEuropean countries require employers to offer employmentcontracts with generous termination benefits lasting manymonths.   &quot;If we were a much larger company, we'd have the in-houseexpertise to know more about potential problems before we gottoo far down the road,&quot; says Paul Schmitz, personnel andbenefits manager of Findley Adhesives Inc., Wauwatosa, Wis.He says the concern had to pay a Swedish employee for threemonths after firing him. &quot;Quite frequently, we encounterthings {overseas} we would have liked to know much sooner.&quot;   Small concerns that dispatch Americans abroad to manageforeign offices usually are freed from such restrictive laborlaws. They also know that there's &quot;at least one person fromcorporate headquarters there representing their interests,&quot;says Mr. Herod, the ORC consultant. &quot;Companies are nervousabout trusting the fate of a significant investment to localstaff. They want at least one person there with whom they caneasily communicate.&quot;   But such advantages come at a price. Even after accountingfor hefty pay raises to cover the higher living costsoverseas, &quot;at least two-thirds of all companies spend more onexpatriates than they need to,&quot; Mr. Herod says. &quot;That'sparticularly true among small and midsized companies thathave {pay} arrangements on an ad hoc basis.&quot;   Firms can fail to realize that foreign assignments holdmore appeal nowadays because the so-called &quot;globalization&quot;push means such a stint &quot;is no longer a one-way ticket tooblivion,&quot; notes Mr. Herod. As a result, &quot;there is less needto provide as many financial incentives as in the past totake these assignments.&quot; Numerous large corporations, forexample, have reduced or eliminated so-called foreign-servicepremiums that used to compensate expatriates solely becausethey lived abroad.   Poor tax planning is another reason that small firms oftenoverpay their U.S. expatriates. Mr. Herod says a number ofsmall companies he advises don't realize that they can reducean expatriate's tax burden -- and thus, the compensationlevel -- by renting an apartment for the employee rather thangiving a cash housing allowance. &quot;The way you pay people, thetiming and the nature of the payments are all absolutelycrucial in terms of what foreign taxes you attract,&quot; he says.   Smaller firms also run a greater risk of sending anill-suited executive abroad because they have comparativelyfew internal candidates to consider for foreign transfers.Personal problems cause up to one-quarter of all expatriatesto cut short their stints, says Noel Kreicker, president ofInternational Orientation Resources, a consulting firm inNorthbrook, Ill.   She recalls an executive of one small U.S. electronicscompany who transferred to Tokyo with his wife and adaughter. Unable to adjust to the move, his family returnedhome six months later. The executive followed them shortlyafterward, but his marriage ended in divorce.   &quot;His wife was very entrenched in a midwestern community,&quot;Ms. Kreicker says. &quot;It was very hard for her to say goodbyeto her lifelong friends and start making those connectionsall over again&quot; in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
