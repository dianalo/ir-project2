Call it &quot;Coup&quot; (oreven better, &quot;Putsch]&quot;) Sure it sort of fizzled in themiddle, but it had a happy ending which, as everybody knows,is the important thing.   In case anyone didn't understand just how important thenews from Moscow was, NBC's Fred Francis was there toexplain. In a report that featured shots of nuclear missilesin mid-flight, Mr. Francis talked of &quot;thousands of warheadspointed at the West.&quot; It was the kind of sensationalism thatbelongs on &quot;Hard Copy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A welcome counterpoint to this heavy breathing was thethoughtful commentary of Garrick Utley. Starting with JeanJacques Rousseau's famous quote, &quot;people get the governmentthey deserve,&quot; Mr. Utley described Russia's history ofautocrats. Then he pointed out that the FULL quote actuallyreads &quot;For 200 years, the Russian people have been slaves;people get the government they deserve.&quot;   Even in the opening hours, the anchors were reverting totype: Dan Rather went for the gut (&quot;After a night of dramaand tension, more drama and tension&quot;); Tom Brokaw went forthe heartstrings (&quot;Gorbachev was on the high wire so long, wewondered how long he could stay up. Now he's been pushed off,how far will he fall?&quot;); and Peter Jennings went for the head(&quot;In a city which has built some appalling architecture overthe past 25 years, the Russian Parliament building is betterlooking than some&quot;).   In those pivotal and historic hours, I'm proud to say,Western capitalism did not capitulate to the Soviet threat.When prime time rolled around, instead of giving in andcovering these momentous events, the networks stuck withtheir scheduled programming. ABC had &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;-- an exhibition game. CBS had &quot;Miss Teen USA 1991.&quot; &quot;Thesegirls are doing it] I'll tell you]&quot; enthused Leeza Gibbons.&quot;Coming up, more teen summer fun]&quot;   But Tuesday, the second day, the images started gettingserious. There was Boris Yeltsin, fist in the air, a hero inthe making. And there was the rolling of the tanks, lookingtoo much like Tiananmen Square. CNN did well, but NBC had thebest images, their cameramen coming through as they wouldseveral times that week. Unfortunately, they also had ArthurKent, who looked like he had been reading too many of his ownpress releases. Leaning seductively into the camera, Mr. Kentspoke in a blow-dried style that matched his blow-dried coif.And talking of pretty, ABC had Diane Sawyer in a much vauntedinterview with Boris Yeltsin that turned out to be threequestions on the run. Then she delivered her report: &quot;Howdoes a ragtag crowd prepare to fight a division of tanks?,&quot;she asked breathlessly. &quot;You think a little radio station cankeep democracy alive?&quot; Luckily, she had her heels onthroughout the whole ordeal.   If the second day was a day of action, the third was a dayof analysis. Experts were trotted out en masse, with Slavicaccents around the dial. Even before the first pictures oftanks pulling out of Moscow appeared (NBC again), the talkhad already shifted. The coup was going to fail. The coupmight fail. The coup had already failed. It was the Russianswho seemed most offended by the junta's poor showing: &quot;Everyschoolboy in Russia knows how to make a coup,&quot; grumbled oneSoviet named Popov. &quot;You block the roads, cut offcommunications.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;The hard liners of todayare not the hard liners of 30 years ago.&quot; All thecommentators seemed to switch simultaneously from calling thecoup leaders &quot;the gang of eight&quot; to &quot;the gang that couldn'tshoot straight.&quot;   On that Wednesday, the city of Moscow was full of rumors,and our TV was reporting them all. &quot;The BBC says that alleight members have been arrested . . .&quot; (CBS) . . .&quot;reportedly arrested . . .&quot; (NBC) . . . &quot;arrest of some orall members . . .&quot; (ABC).   At a time of swirling rumors, NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show wentright to the most authoritative source -- novelist TomClancy. Writing a military thriller like &quot;Red October&quot;clearly made him qualified to opine on &quot;schisms in the Sovietarmy&quot; and &quot;strategic failures.&quot;   Not to be outdone, CBS had Dan Rather create some of hisDan Ratherisms: &quot;The coup leaders have alreadyhi-diddle-diddled outta here.&quot; CBS reporter Jonathan Sandersalso got into the spirit, talking of &quot;democracy riding highwith a courageous Siberian in the saddle.&quot;   It was CBS's Tom Fenton who noticed the turning point inthe coup -- the moment the grey-suited Soviet TV announcercaught himself in mid-sentence, stared confusedly at thesheet of paper he had been handed, and in one breath,switched from the coup leaders' line to the reformers'.   As in all major events in the past two or three years, TVwas central in this coup attempt. &quot;The American government isgetting its information from TV,&quot; said Fred Francis. &quot;Theyknow no more than you do. They're glued to the TV.Fortunately or unfortunately, U.S. intelligence doesn't moveas fast as we do.&quot; In today's world, the world of the globalliving room, you don't need spies when you've got anchors.   So who were the all-star spies? In part, they were theusual suspects: Jeff Greenfield, Ted Koppel, Stephen Cohen,Robert Legvold. Despite her perpetually worried expression,CNN's Eileen O'Connor came up with some legitimate scoops,like the reformers setting up governments in exile in casethe Parliament building was seized. Not quite as stellar wasTom Brokaw's insistence on &quot;joy&quot; and &quot;raw emotion.&quot; And whocan forget Barbara Walters, as &quot;20/20&quot; re-ran her interviewwith Boris Yeltsin, in which she asked the Russian leader allthe big questions, such as: Do you have a drinking problem?(It is true that for a hero, Boris sure does have aboozy-looking face.)   By the end of the week, the statues were being pulleddown, and so was the Communist Party. Over and over, theimage was repeated -- Lenin, Dzherzhinsky, Lenin biting thedust. It was a nice, easy symbol, the kind TV loves. And thenthere was another image too: Mikhail Gorbachev and BorisYeltsin side by side for the first time in a week, and let metell you, Gorby was looking a lot shorter than Boris.   All the reporters were talking about &quot;the big winners.&quot;&quot;The Baltics are the big winners,&quot; said Fred Francis. &quot;BorisYeltsin is the big winner,&quot; declared Peter Jennings. The bigwinners? Forget it. 5,000 miles away, looking at your TV, youdidn't need an analyst to tell you the big winners -- theSoviet people, and more power to them.</TEXT></DOC>
