On the two most controversial issues on the lawyers' agenda, flag-burning and the rights of people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the ABA delegates took uncharacteristically progressive positions.    On Wednesday, the lawyers voted to adopt a report issued earlier this month opposing both a constitutional amendment and legislation banning flag desecration. While the lawyers inserted language saying that they &quot;abhorred&quot; such activity, after a lengthy debate they went along with a blue-ribbon panel, including former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold, upholding the First Amendment rights of political dissidents.    The ABA's policy arm, the House of Delegates, also adopted a report calling for strong measures to protect the confidentiality of people with AIDS. And, earlier in the week, it also sided with individuals and against the government on a national security issue involving extradition proceedings. The moves seemed to surprise and even amuse some longtime ABA members. Philip Lacovara, a prominent litigator now in the legal department of General Electric Co., jokingly referred to &quot;that left-leaning House of Delegates&quot; as he left the proceedings one afternoon.    ---   The recently completed and controversial court term was never far from mind. As the ABA meeting began on Aug. 3, the group's outgoing president, Robert Raven of San Francisco, issued a personal plea to establish a death-penalty age minimum of 18. In Stanford v. Kentucky, decided earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that capital punishment could be imposed for acts committed before that age.    And outside the hotel where Justice Antonin Scalia {one of three justices who put in appearances at the seaside convention} participated in a program on the death penalty, about a dozen demonstrators protested the court's death-penalty and abortion decisons. As Justice Scalia began his remarks, a woman in the audience shouted, &quot;Keep abortion safe and legal for all women across the U.S.&quot;    ---   Another harbinger of change within the ABA is the candidacy of a woman -- Roberta Cooper Ramo -- for the group's presidency. Ms. Ramo is the second woman to campaign for the ABA's top job. {The first woman lost her bid in 1986}.    Politicking for the ABA presidency is intense and begins far in advance. Ms. Ramo's election for the 1992-1993 term, for example, won't be decided until the ABA's winter meeting in 1991. But the Albuquerque attorney and her supporters were out glad-handing and arm-twisting in force. Ms. Ramo, who is running against two men, said, &quot;If we keep going to the same well, it's going to be difficult to change the face of the profession.&quot;    Interest in her campaign seemed high, especially since the new ABA president, L. Stanley Chauvin of Louisville, Ky., and the two male attorneys all but certain to succeed him in the coming two terms, have run for the office without opposition.    In an expansive gesture, the ABA also broadened its geographic base for the first time in memory. After lobbying the organization for nearly a year, Tom Bolt, an attorney from the U.S. Virgin Islands, was admitted to the House of Delegates. &quot;They were worried we didn't have enough lawyers,&quot; notes Mr. Bolt, who now represents a 500-attorney delegation back home.    ---   The theme of the convention was supposed to be &quot;Resolving Disputes in Pacific Ways&quot; and all the lawyers combing Waikiki Beach draped in leis and Hawaiian shirts did present a mellow facade. But the emotional high point of the meeting was the anything-but-peaceful recollections of Nien Cheng, who addressed the ABA at a luncheon on Tuesday. The 74-year-old Ms. Cheng is author of the 1987 book, &quot;Life and Death in Shanghai.&quot; She excoriated the Chinese government for the recent bloodshed in Tiananmen Square, pointing out that government leaders, not the students, trampled on the rule of law.    She also recited the grim details of her own arrest and imprisonment by Red Guards. Starved, beaten and denounced as a spy for six-and-a-half years, Ms. Cheng drew a laugh when she said, &quot;I didn't have access to a good lawyer. I had to defend myself.&quot;    ---   Lawyers who weren't busy on the beach or signing up for tours of the Hawaiian Islands could have attended scores of panel discussions on topics ranging from global warming to insider trading. The panels were all carefully balanced with recognized experts representing all points of view. The insider-trading program, for example, featured Arthur Mathews and Harvey Pitt, two well-known Washington, D.C., securities attorneys who represented imprisoned former stock speculator Ivan Boesky. Their counterpart on the goverment's side was Gary Lynch, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division. Program notes made no mention of the fact that Mr. Lynch, too, is joining the Wall Street side. In a few weeks, he will leave the SEC and join the New York law firm of Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell. </TEXT></DOC>
