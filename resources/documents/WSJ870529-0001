Consideration of the changes, which could be in place as early as year-end, come partly in response to criticisms that the index is no longer an accurate tool for projecting economic trends. According to a department spokesman, the index is designed to forecast economic trends three to six months in advance.    The spokesman emphasized that no decisions have been made on what changes to make or when they would be put into place. However, he said the changes under consideration include altering the method for measuring inventories, or possibly adding a component for auto sales.    The changes have been proposed to a committee of statisticians from several government agencies. Some of the proposals were discussed at a meeting earlier this month.    The department has made various changes to the index since its inception. Earlier this year, it dropped one component -- net-business formation -- after deciding it was unreliable. The dropping of that component, which was designed to measure new-business starts, leaves the index with 11 components.    In the 1970s, oil prices were removed from the index on the grounds that they were controlled prices that didn't reflect market forces. </TEXT></DOC>
