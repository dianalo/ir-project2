As of Monday, Romanian tourists traveling to Czechoslovakia willhave to show an official invitation, a voucher proving they havepaid for their stay, or a valid visa for a country of finaldestination, CTK said.   However, it said the measures ``do not mean cancellation of themutually agreed visa-free travel'' between the two countries.   CTK said that starting Thursday, Romanian tourists going to EastGermany through Czechoslovakia must produce the required papers atthe Czechoslovak-Hungarian border or be turned back.   The new regulations came after a growing number of Romaniantourists sought to stay in Czechoslovakia after being deniedadmission to East Germany.   Romania has the weakest economy among the six Eastern Europeancountries which are trying to introduce market-oriented reforms.   Many Romanians augment their incomes by buying products abroadthat are scarce at home and selling them on the black market,leading Romanian authorities to impose stricter customs regulations.   Thousands of others have sought to emigrate in hopes of findingbetter living conditions and jobs.   East German authorities now require Romanians to produce anofficial invitiation or proof that they possess enough hardcurrency to pay for their stay. Romanian visitors also must holdround-trip tickets.   East German border officials have turned back about 800Romanians at the Czechoslovak border over the past few days. TheMlada Fronta newspaper said most of those sent back were RomanianGypsies.</TEXT></DOC>
