Britain's pledge was the first among the four European governments that have been asked to assist the consortium. The approval of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher removes an important obstacle to Airbus's plans. The consortium's French, West German and Spanish partners still are negotiating with their respective governments to obtain funding; the United Kingdom's decision adds pressure for them to reach agreement soon.    British Aerospace originally had sought $1.26 billion. Nevertheless, Sir Austin Pearce, the concern's chairman, expressed pleasure and said the assistance would be enough to allow British Aerospace to undertake its portion of the work on both Airbus planes, the A-330 and the A-340. The British government's assistance will be used during the project's early years, a British Aerospace spokesman said. He indicated the company independently will raise the remaining $503.3 million later.    The U.S. government has objected to European governments' heavy Airbus assistance, as the consortium increasingly is challenging U.S. manufacturers. Airbus already has obtained commitments to order the two new models from one major U.S. airline, Northwest Airlines.    Further sales in the U.S. undoubtedly would reignite a trade dispute that flared briefly earlier this year. But European government leaders seem determined to support Airbus's effort to become a major competitor. These leaders argue that U.S. military sales and research contracts provide major help to the U.S. aerospace industry.    &quot;At a time when the competitive pressures in the world aerospace industry are as strong as ever, I would like to praise the determination of Airbus Industrie and its partners to extend their family of large airliners,&quot; U.K. Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon told Parliament yesterday.    The British are prepared to answer any charges of unfair subsidies. The aid &quot;is a repayable loan, not a gift, and we're required to pay it all back,&quot; the British Aerospace spokesman said. &quot;We wouldn't have gone to the government if we weren't convinced there was going to be a return.&quot;    British officials declined to reveal the terms of their assistance. &quot;This launch aid will be fully repayable on terms designed to yield a return in real terms on the government's investment,&quot; Mr. Channon said.    The British Aerospace spokesman said the aid will be repaid by a levy on each Airbus plane sold. There won't be any separate cash repayment, unlike what the British government required for previous Airbus assistance. In the A-320 Airbus project, which British Aerospace currently is working on, the company must pay the U.K. government about $84 million between 1990 and 1992 -- plus a levy on each plane sold.    By guaranteeing thousands of jobs, the British decision also should remove a potential issue from the June 11 general election. British Aerospace said the government aid means continued employment for 5,000 of its employees and another 5,000 workers in other British companies. By the early 1990s, when production reaches full speed, as many as 27,000 British workers will be building the wings of the A-330 and A-340 planes. Over the project's 15 to 20 year life, British Aerospace expects total revenue of about $16.8 billion from designing and building the wings.    Airbus has said it expects to sell 1,000 of the new planes, representing total revenue of about $80 billion.    The British assistance depends on the approval of the three other governments. The French government still is working on details of the transaction, but has agreed in principle to provide $1.08 billion in aid. German negotiations are complicated, the British Aerospace spokesman said, and it isn't clear when agreement might be reached. Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., the German Airbus partner, informally has asked the German Finance Ministry for some $3.92 billion in subsidies -- about $1.68 billion to pay for development of the new planes' fuselages and the rest to pay off debt from past Airbus programs.    The Spanish share of the project is a relatively minor 4%, and the British Aerospace spokesman didn't know the status of the Spanish talks. </TEXT></DOC>
