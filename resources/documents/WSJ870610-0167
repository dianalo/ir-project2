Elliott M. Wiener, chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;I would say we expect to do as well if not better than last year at this point.&quot; Mr. Wiener based his predictions in part on the home builder's recent expansion into two major eastern markets.    For the first quarter, Levitt's profit more than tripled from a year earlier to $283,000, or eight cents a share. Revenue rose 58% to $19 million.    In an interview, Mr. Wiener said he expects higher revenue and wider profit margins this year, although he declined to make specific predictions. He said several projects in the New York-New Jersey area and the Washington, D.C.-Virginia area should contribute to the wider margins.    Houses built in these areas typically can be sold for greater profit than houses in Florida, where the company does much of its business, he said. Moreover, he added, the company recently decided to add more expensive models. A project scheduled to open in about two months in Fairfax County, Va., for instance, will feature homes priced as high as $260,000 -- more than three times the price of the company's average house in Florida.    He said he doesn't think the recent rise in mortgage rates will damp demand because most of the company's developments are in areas with high employment and population growth.    Mr. Wiener said housing demand remains strong in all of Levitt's markets. He also said the company is proceeding &quot;very well&quot; with its plans to diversify into congregate housing for the elderly. </TEXT></DOC>
