They have attacked this mud-brick town a few miles from a majorair base three times this year but have not taken it. After eachforay they evaporate into the hills or surrounding villages.   It is a tactic repeated throughout most of the country.   ``They are not so near as they were before, but I don't knowexactly where they are,'' Col. Mobine Nurzi told reporters flown toShindand this month to refute guerrilla claims of capturing it.   He said at least 100 guerrillas were killed in the latest,weeklong assault on Shindand, about 425 miles southwest of thecapital city of Kabul and about 90 miles east of the border withIran, where some guerrillas are based.   But one soldier told reporters, ``They really pounded us beforewithdrawing. How do we know how many were killed?''   After the Soviets withdrew their troops in February, theU.S.-backed guerrillas were predicting their easy capture ofprovincial centers like Jalalabad, if not Kabul itself.   Now seven months later, their military campaigns remainprimarily the hit-and-run attacks that successfully drove theSoviets out.   But guerrilla tactics are not going to win the guerrillas acivil war against the Kabul government or even much leverage at thebargaining table.   And the fatigue with the war rampant in the civilian populationafter 10 years of fighting and 1 million deaths is also infectingthe mujahedeen guerrillas, or Islamic holy warriors.   ``The mujahedeen have the capacity to harass the Kabulgovernment, but they are not going to win the war,'' said an Asiandiplomat, speaking on condition on anonymity.   ``The average commander, the average fighter is tired,'' saidone U.N. official. ``There is battle fatigue, there is no doubt.''   Yet the war wears on and the mujahedeen control most of thecountryside.   Pilots on the runway in the southern city of Kandahar, fearingguerrilla rockets, taxi at 100 mph.   Troops at the last checkpoint in north Kabul before the SalangHighway, the supply lifeline from the Soviet Union, report it wasrecently closed by guerrilla attacks for a few hours on severaloccassions.   There is constant low-level combat that occasionally flares intofull-scale battles.   At the daily press briefings, the government spokesman reports alitany of ``sweeping and mopping up operations'' throughout theprovinces bordering Pakistan, where most of the mujahedeen areheadquartered.   The repetition indicates the mujahedeen cannot be swept away butthat the government is confident they can be kept at bay for themost part.   ``Despite the attempts of the extremists, the situation in thecountry is by and large calm,'' President Najib recently told agroup of foreign visitors.   He referred with bravado to the massive supply convoy that justarrived in Kandahar: ``Such a convoy rarely could exist even in thepresence of the Soviet troops.''   But weeks of conflicting reports about when the 1,000 or sovehicles would arrive indicated it had run into trouble.   Mahmoud Baryalai, the first deputy prime minister in charge ofsupplies, said earlier that the group of trucks was bogged down byguerrilla rocket fire on the last 90 miles before Kandahar.   It was not constant, he said, but prevented moving ahead.   The mujahedeen claimed to have knocked out 110 trucks, while thegovernment said it lost three trucks and a tank. It said a year'ssupply of ammunition got through.   The convoy apparently veered off hundreds of miles into thedesert to avoid the attacks, eventually taking more than threeweeks to cover the 360 miles from the town of Torgundi on theSoviet border.   While sporadic attacks can interrupt supply routes, theguerrillas have been unable to take a major town.   A concerted attack on Khost, about 24 miles from the Pakistaniborder, threatened the city briefly late last month. But diplomatssaid the mujahedeen lacked the sustained supply routes needed toovercome government forces surrounded by dense minefields and tanks.   ``It is difficult for the mujahedeen to capture anything,'' saidanother Asian diplomat in Kabul. ``They were trained as a guerrillaforce and they are trained to make conventional attacks. They lackheavy artillery, air support.''   The government uses both heavily. Dawn in Kabul is punctuated byoutgoing Scud and other missiles. Spotting Scud trails at night isa favorite activity at diplomatic parties.   The Scuds, with a range of 180 miles are used against mujahedeenpositions along the border.   To knock out guerrilla positions around Kabul, Frog-7 missileswith a range of about 48 miles were deployed late last month.   The Continental Hotel, where most foreigners stay, shakes dailyfrom a nearby missile battery.   The mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan have so far refusednegotiations. But there are only six weeks left before winterweather sets in and most military activity stops because mountaintrails are impassable.   Said one ambassador, quoting a visiting Englishman during thewars of the last century: ``the only time the Afghans are at peaceis when they are fighting.''</TEXT></DOC>
