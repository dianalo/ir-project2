Media reports were filled with foreboding. The New York Times headlined that Chernobyl &quot;alters the nuclear equation.&quot; The St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorialized that &quot;a disaster could occur again tomorrow in America.&quot; And an NBC story concluded that &quot;the nuclear industry faces a grim future.&quot;    The fires are out in Kiev but the questions still smolder. Can it happen here? Was Chernobyl a failure of the Soviet system or a warning of things to come? To find out what the experts think, the Center for Media and Public Affairs surveyed 580 scientists selected randomly from American Men and Women of Science.    Our poll reveals strong scientific belief in the safety of U.S. nuclear plants, combined with skepticism that a Chernobyl-style disaster could happen here. Specifically, 71% rate a Chernobyl-style accident as improbable, over four times the number (17%) who rate it probable. Even more, 82%, regard U.S. reactors as safer than the Chernobyl plant. Is that safe enough? Two out of three scientists (66%) say that nuclear plants here are currently safe, compared with 17% who find them unsafe.    In light of these attitudes, it is not surprising that 88% think nuclear power will be important in meeting our electricity needs in the years ahead. And most telling of all, we asked the scientists to rank their preferences for living within five miles of several major industrial facilities. More scientists said they would rather live near a nuclear electric-power plant than any of the other industrial facilities. Only 5% said they would prefer to live near an oil refinery; 8%, a chemical plant; 22%, a coal-fired power plant; 25%, an airport; and 34%, a nuclear power plant.    Significantly, after all we've learned about Chernobyl, the proportion of scientists rating plants as safe has risen slightly from surveys we conducted in 1980 and 1984, for a study directed by political scientist Stanley Rothman. Those surveys also established that pro-nuclear viewpoints are strongest among scientists trained in energy-related fields, but that they aren't based on economic self-interest.    Thus, the Chernobyl disaster failed to shake the scientific community's longstanding confidence in U.S. nuclear safety. By contrast, public support for the nuclear option has dropped substantially since the early 1970s, before leveling off in recent years. Why the discrepancy? One reason may be that scientists trust their own expertise, while the public depends on the mass media. The Rothman-Lichter study found that anti-nuclear stories outnumbered pro-nuclear stories 2 to 1 on network TV news from 1970 to 1983. Among the &quot;experts&quot; the public saw on television, critics outnumbered supporters of nuclear energy 5 to 1. Little has changed since then. A current CMPA study shows major media Chernobyl coverage drew mainly negative lessons for U.S. nuclear safety. By a 3-to-1 margin, news stories concluded that a Chernobyl-style disaster is likely to occur in the U.S.    Still, the news doesn't operate in a vacuum. Coverage partly reflects broader changes in American society. For example, an activist adversary culture within the scientific community seeks out the media contacts that more traditional pro-nuclear scientists disdain. Thus, the highly unrepresentative Union of Concerned Scientists has become the most widely quoted &quot;expert&quot; group in TV nuclear news stories. Even balanced stories often pit a UCS scientist against a utility spokesman.    More broadly, a loose network of environmentalist and other &quot;public-interest&quot; groups has succeeded in framing the nuclear-safety debate in terms of public good vs. private interest. Fifteen years of grassroots organizing, media cultivation and regulatory challenges have turned nuclear safety from a technical problem into a political issue. As nuclear attitudes became enmeshed in the political culture, populist suspicions of big business and big government took their toll.    Today the scientific community views the Chernobyl accident as a Soviet failure rather than a portent of domestic disaster. For the public, however, the lessons of Chernobyl may depend more on the politics than the science of nuclear power.    ---   Mr. Lichter is co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
