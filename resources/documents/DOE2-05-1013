Particular emphasis is placed on the identificationof such polymorphic sequences that associate with lipoprotein metabolismdisorders. The hyperlipidemias, with hypertension, diabetes mellitus,and cigarette smoking, are among the major risk factors for the developmentof atheroma. Familial studies have shown that there is a strong inheritedcomponent to hyperlipidemia, but only in the minority of patients isthe condition transmitted as a monogenic defect. Conventionally, hyperlipidemiahas been studied by looking for abnormalities in protein structure andfunction in the clearly defined disorders. In this manner, several geneticdefects in the cell surface receptor that normally controls the degradationof LDL have been identified. In addition, a mutant form of apolipoproteinA-I (apo-A-I/sub Milano//sup 3/) associated with hypertriglyceridemiaand a polymorphic form of apolipoprotein E associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemiahave been demonstrated to exist in the population through variationsin protein structure. More recently, in an attempt to identify biochemicaldefects underlying the less well-characterized forms of hyperlipidemia,large population samples of serum have been screened for variant formsof apoA-I, II, and IV. This approach has become possible by the developmentof methodology that allows the rapid isolation of these apolipoproteins,from serum samples, for two-dimensional gel analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
