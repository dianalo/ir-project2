Both leaders reported making little progress during an afternoonof talks Sunday on an issue that has split the alliance, describingtheir talks as frank and intensive.   Kohl assured Mrs. Thatcher of his country's firm allegiance toNATO, whose leaders meet in Brussels at the end of the month for asummit.   The West German leader's call last week for prompt superpowernegotiations on short-range nuclear weapons has placed him in abattle of wills with Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush.   ``We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' Kohl told reportersduring a joint news conference with Mrs. Thatcher after Sunday'stalks in this village west of the Rhine River city of Mannheim.   However, Kohl said he thought the issue could be worked outbefore the Brussels summit. Mrs. Thatcher also expressed optimism,but stressed that all North Atlantic Treaty Organization nationsneed to agree on a common position.   The British leader said any suggestion of eliminatingshort-range nuclear weapons in Europe is unacceptable anddangerous. At one point, she appeared to question Kohl's positionon the issue.   ``I'm sure Mr. Kohl will correct me if I have misunderstood himon this issue,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.   Kohl responded by having his interpreter read a line from hisspeech to Parliament last week in which he rejected the totalelimination of the tactical nuclear weapons under the presentbalance of military forces in Europe.   Washington and London say talks on reducing short-range nucleararsenals should not begin as long as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact hasa superiority in conventional forces. They also argue that it wouldbe hard to stop talks from ending in the total elimination ofshort-range forces that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevadvocates.   The West Germans say superpower arms talks should be attemptedon a broad scale in light of the current disarmament climate inMoscow. They remind their allies that most of NATO's short-rangenuclear weapons are based in West Germany and would be usedexclusively on German soil in the event of war.   Critics of the West German position say it divides and weakensthe alliance at a time NATO must show unity on defense.   Mrs. Thatcher said elimination of short-term weapons would meanthe ``Soviet Union will have achieved its objective of gettingland-based nuclear weapons out of Europe. This I believe would bedisastrous.''   Throughout the 40-minute news conference, Mrs. Thatcherrepeatedly returned to the topic of flexible response and thenecessity of upgrading NATO's aging tactical weapons arsenal.   ``Flexible response is not just something you mouth,'' Mrs.Thatcher said. ``Strength must continue not only in words; strengthhas to be translated into weaponry.''   She added that the missiles must be upgraded ``because obsoleteweapons do not deter.''   Under the flexible response policy, the allies could respond toa Soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons.   Kohl, faced with uncertain election prospects next year, wantsto delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization anddeployment of the Lance short-range nuclear rockets.   Recent polls show that the majority of West Germans no longerbelieve the Soviet Union to be a military threat.   Kohl, while reaffirming his commitment to NATO's flexibleresponse strategy, was also adamant that the West German positionon missile talks be acknowledged.   He said he hoped a ``joint document which takes our specialsituation into account'' could be prepared at the Brussels summit.   ``And that has nothing at all to do with the Germans havingbecome unreliable or anything like that,'' Kohl said, referring tosuggestions that West Germany is no longer following agreed uponNATO doctrine.</TEXT></DOC>
