Basicrelations are listed for the calculation of the correction factor forcontinuous, pulsed, and pulsed swept radiation, and the methods are presentedof solving the relations. The computer code, graphs and tables are listedfor determination of the saturation factor on the basis of measurements.The feasibility of the method for practical measurements is discussed.(author). 3 figs., 2 tabs., 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
