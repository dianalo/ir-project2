Justice authorities freed Honecker from prison on health groundsTuesday, and the 77-year-old former leader who faces a treasontrial in March was taken to the home of Lutheran pastor Uwe Holmerin Lobetal, near Bernau.   Some parishioners were angered by Holmer's action and threatenedto leave the congregation, church official Hans-Otto Furien toldADN.   Furien said the church decided to give Honecker and his wife,Margot, refuge because they were ``in effect, homeless.''   The church ministers to the weak and down-and-out, and``Honecker, who a short time ago appeared powerful, is now amongthem,'' ADN quoted Furien as saying.   Honecker is one of about two dozen senior officials of thedisgraced former leadership awaiting trial on charges of corruptionand misuse of office.   The man who ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ousterduring a pro-democracy uprising in October was jailed Monday,immediately after he left East Berlin's Charite hospital, where wasrecuperating from cancer surgery.   But an East Berlin court refused to issue a detention warrant,noting Honecker's ill health, and he was freed Tuesday night.   Christian Naecke, a church official in Dresden, said he hadreceived many insulting calls because Honecker had been givenrefuge by a fellow pastor.</TEXT></DOC>
