Apple decided ACE included too many partners and was too focused onhardware, he said.;    Apple initially approached IBM last summer, but IBMshowed no interest in a possible alliance at that time, Sculley said. Sixmonths later IBM called Apple and suggested further discussions.;    Duringthe spring, Sculley made the decision to show Apple's &quot;best stuff&quot; to IBMofficials. The potential alliance was less likely to move ahead if Apple beganby withholding its most significant work, he said. Before entering a jointventure with IBM, Apple officials had to convince themselves their companycould maintain competitive advantages for its products. Apple identified themost essential aspects of its Macintosh technology and the elements that couldbe shared. &quot;We didn't divide up the Mac core and license it out,&quot; Sculleysaid. &quot;We kept the crown jewels intact and proprietary to Apple.&quot;;    Appleofficials also had to convince themselves that IBM was serious aboutdeveloping new products through the venture and bringing them to market. IBMhas entered into many agreements with other companies in recent years, butonly a few seem to have resulted in significant products. Sculley said he hadto be certain that Apple wouldn't be &quot;just another agreement.&quot;;    &quot;We hadspent enough time with senior people at IBM to know this was really importantto them,&quot; Sculley said. During the next few years, &quot;you're going to see a verydifferent IBM,&quot; he predicted.;    Finally, Apple officials had to convincethemselves that employees of the two companies -- often viewed as culturalopposites -- could work well together.;    In May, Sculley talked to BillGates, chairman and chief executive of Microsoft Corp., about the frustrationsand pitfalls of working closely with IBM. Microsoft had developed its DOSsoftware for use on IBM computers and collaborated with the company on othersoftware projects, but their relationship has become increasingly strained.Gates sharply criticized IBM in a recent memo to his employees.;    &quot;Peoplewho said these two cultures couldn't work together will be very surprised,&quot;Sculley said. &quot;Put an Apple engineer and an IBM engineer side by side,&quot; hesaid. &quot;I defy you to tell the difference.&quot;;    The broad outlines of theventure were put together during 7 1/2 weeks of &quot;around-the-clock discussions&quot;involving about 150 people, Sculley said. The meetings were held in Austin,Texas, then in San Jose and then at IBM headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., hesaid.;    Many details of the deal still must be worked out and put into adefinitive agreement that Sculley expects the companies to complete &quot;sometimethis fall.&quot;;    In the meantime, &quot;things are really humming between Apple andIBM,&quot; he said. &quot;We like each other and we're getting an awful lot done.&quot;; AGLIMPSE OF WHAT'S AHEAD FOR APPLE;  Chairman and CEO John Sculley and JosephGraziano, Apple's chief financial officer, offered numerous glimpses into thecompany's operations in a wide-ranging meeting with reporters Thursday:;(box)Computers and printers introduced since last fall are likely to accountfor 80 percent of sales this year. Apple had been getting about 35 percent ofits sales from new products.; (box)Apple will introduce an unusually largenumber of products during the next three years. &quot;We've never had as muchproduct development going . . . as right now,&quot; Sculley said.; (box)Apple isworking on a successor to its Macintosh computers that Sculley described onlyas the &quot;new system.&quot; Apple will continue to offer the Macintosh line for therest of the decade, he said.; (box) Apple will shed 400,000 square feet ofoffice space in Cupertino over the next two years as it moves some operationsout of Silicon Valley and shifts research and engineering operations to acampus now under construction.; (box)The company intends to move its customersupport center, consisting of about 500 people, from Cupertino to a lower-costarea. Candidates: Austin, Tex., Phoenix and Colorado Springs.; (box)The firmwill continue to manufacture computers at its Fremont plant despite reportsthat some operations may move to Colorado, Sculley said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RON WOLF, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  987  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215169,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
