The centerpiece of the reform is a new 3 percent ``consumptiontax'' on everything from taxi rides to apartment rents. At the sametime, the reform cuts corporate, inheritance, higher-level incomeand residential taxes by $44.6 billion in fiscal 1989.   Part of those cuts will be offset by the sales tax, which theFinance Ministry has said will bring in $24.8 billion its firstyear.   It was Japan's first major tax overhaul since World War II, andshoppers found themselves confronting long lines as shopkeeperstried to adjust to the new system.   ``Customers must wait longer at the register since we're notused to calculating this tax yet,'' said Tokiko Sekitake, a clerkat a drugstore in downtown Tokyo. ``But they aren't complaining.Most blame the government and sympathize with us.''   Dozens of city councils across Japan criticized the tax, andsome have reportedly pledged not to implement it in certain sectors.   Because of adjustments in a variety of taxes, the reformaffected goods unevenly. Some prices rose, while others fell andothers remained unchanged.   It lowered taxes on expensive imported liquor but increased theprice of milk. Vending machine soft drink prices stayed the same.   Television sets were cheaper, but newspapers raised theirprices. The cost of a Big Mac hamburger at McDonalds went from$2.84 to $2.93 but because of altered service charges, meals atposh restaurants became more affordable.   Prices of foreign luxury cars and domestic autos dropped, whiletaxi and subway fares increased. Taxes on automobiles will be cutfrom the present 15 percent to just 3 percent in three years.   The government granted a special exemption to small businesses,meaning two-thirds of Japanese enterprises won't have to hand overthe tax to the federal government. Small business and theagricultural sector are the mainstay of support for the governingLiberal Democratic Party.   But many small enterprises, such as independent taxis anddiscount stores, raised their prices anyway to offset increasedoperating costs.   The government says the sales tax will fit the needs of Japan'scurrent economy better than an income tax. It claims the main goalof the reform plan is to distribute the tax burden more equitablyby lightening the burden on middle-income workers.   But several groups, including the 1 million-member JapanHousewives' Association, claim ambiguities in the reforms will leadto unfair price increases and even formation of price-fixingcartels.   Soon after taking office in October 1987, Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita made tax reform a major goal. Last December his party,which commands comfortable majorities in both houses of Parliament,voted the package into law despite the first no-confidence motionby opposition parties in five years.   But the tax reform and a stock-trading scandal involvingTakeshita and many of his party's elite have led to support ratingsas low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls.   Opposition party leaders repeated their calls for abolition ofthe tax and for Takeshita to resign.   ``Prime Minister Takeshita has said there will come a day when(people) will be glad the sales tax was implemented,'' SocialistParty Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi said in a speech today.``That is the lie of the century.''</TEXT></DOC>
