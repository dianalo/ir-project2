In the year-ago period, it posted net income of $1.8 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $30.4 million.    Environmental Treatment said it expects earnings to be hurt by a slowdown in industrial-remediation activity and by operational and production problems at its Environmental Testing andamp; Certification Corp. unit's Edison, N.J., laboratory.    Environmental Treatment develops mobile-treatment technologies to remedy and manage hazardous and toxic materials.    Separately, the company said it closed a $30 million revolving-credit facility with several banks led by Mellon Bank, a unit of Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, as agent.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Environmental Treatment closed at $16.50 a share, down $1. </TEXT></DOC>
