The method consists the steps of: calibrating the transmissionto provide acceptable shift quality at a less than optimum specifiedengine performance level; predefining engine acceleration levels thatwould occur during shifting of the transmission at an engine performancelevel corresponding to the less than optimum specified level; measuringan actual engine acceleration level in the course of transmission shifting;and during shifting of the transmission, retarding the engine spark timingfrom the value normally scheduled by the engine control so as to bringthe actual engine acceleration level into correspondence with the predefinedengine acceleration level, thereby bringing the actual engine performancelevel into correspondence with the less than optimum specified engineperformance level for which the transmission is calibrated.</TEXT></DOC>
