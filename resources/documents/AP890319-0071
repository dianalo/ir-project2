In an article about Lowe in the April issue of Cosmopolitanmagazine, Fonda said of the handsome star: ``He's a phenomenon, muchlike a young Frank Sinatra in the way he works the women in theaudience ... He'd make a good politician.''   Lowe, 25, rose to fame as part of the so-called brat pack ofyoung, new actors in films like ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``TheOutsiders,'' and ``About Last Night.''   He also made a name for himself with a string of romances withhigh-profile women like Princess Stephanie of Monaco and Fawn Hall,ex-secretary to Oliver North, on trial for his role in theIran-Contra affair.   Lowe himself had a few less-than-politic comments on Ms. Hall.   He told Cosmopolitan he was busy making a film during theIran-Contra hearings, ``so I wasn't aware of all the ins and outsthe way I would have been if I'd been reading the papers every day.I knew Fawn had something going, and I wasn't sure what, but I knewshe was real tall and blond and stuffed documents in her underwear.''   He added, ``Well, she swears to me she put them in her boots.''   Lowe said they dated several times and now are just friends.</TEXT></DOC>
