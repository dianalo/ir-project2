Setting up what was expected to be the first legislativeshowdown with the governing Liberal Democratic Party, leaders ofthe Socialists and three other main opposition parties agreed tosubmit a bill to abolish the 3 percent sales tax.   The tax, rammed through Parliament by the Liberal Democrats latelast year over an opposition boycott, took effect April 1 and wasseen as a key factor in the Socialists' major gains in Sunday'selection for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.   The Socialists' 67 seats leave them well short of a majority inthe 252-member house. But conservative Liberal Democratic Party,now with 109, lost their majority for the first time in its 34-yearhistory.   They still have a commanding majority in the more powerful lowerhouse, but a legislative wrangle over the tax could increasepressure for new elections for the lower house before they are duein July 1990.   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced Monday he will resign totake responsibility for the loss of 33 upper house seats.   Liberal Democratic leaders decided Tuesday to set up a committeeto discuss how their next party leader should be chosen, a partyofficial said.   The committee, headed by Seisuke Okuno, a nine-term member ofthe lower house, will hold its first meeting Thursday, said theofficial, who requested anonymity.   But with no clear successor in sight, the selection is expectedto take up to a month. Liberal Democratic leaders have said theyhope to fill the vacancy by mid-August in time for a new session ofParliament, which by law must convene within 30 days of an election.   The Liberal Democratic Party still has a majority in the lowerhouse, which elects the prime minister.   The party is considering three methods of choosing its nextpresident _ voting open to all party members, an election open onlyto Liberal Democratic members of members of Parliament, and closednegotiations among party leaders.   The party is expected to opt for a vote among its legislators.Voting by all 4 million party members would take time to organizeand closed negotiations likely would be criticized as undemocratic.   On Tuesday, party Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimotoacknowleged ``there was some dissatisfaction among party members''when party leaders selected Uno to replace Noboru Takeshita.   Takeshita, head of the party's largest faction, resigned toaccept responsibility for a bribery scandal that tainted much ofthe Liberal Democratic elite. In the scandal, the Recruit Co., apublishing conglomerate, was accused of doling out millions ofdollars of political donations and underpriced stocks to obtainfavors.   Before stepping down, however, Takeshita virtually hand-pickedUno, a colorless politician with no power base of his own, but withno links to Recruit.   Soon after Uno took office June 2, published reports alleged hehad kept several paid mistresses, including a geisha who later toldher story on TV.   The new scandal outraged women's groups across the country,after the Recruit affair already had contributed to erosion of theLiberal Democrats' popularity. Japanese farmers, traditionalsupporters of the party, were angered by moves to open Japan's farmproduct market wider to imports.   Trading on Japan's stock market Tuesday was bullish, even thoughthe election marked the first big defeat for the pro-businessLiberal Democrats since the nation emerged as a financialsuperpower.   The government on Tuesday sought to minimize the impact of itspolitical troubles on foreign relations with assurances thatplanned diplomatic contacts will go ahead, including the defensechief's visit to Washington.   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will travel to Paris thisweekend for international talks on the Cambodia issue, and DefenseAgency chief Taku Yamasaki will go ahead with a scheduled trip toWashington in August, said a ministry official who spoke oncondition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
