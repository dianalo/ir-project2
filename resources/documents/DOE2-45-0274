However, we have frequently encountered caseswith carcinoma of the colon which showed accumulation of /sup 67/Ga-citrate.We determined detectability of carcinoma of the colon by /sup 67/Ga scintigraphyand studied factors involving accumulation of /sup 67/Ga in terms ofclinical usefulness of this procedure. /sup 67/Ga scintigrams were reevaluatedin 21 patients who were proven to have carcinoma of the colon by surgeryor autopsy. Carcinomas of the colon were visualized by /sup 67/Ga-scintigraphyin 15 cases (71.4 %). Each patient was evaluated pathologically and correlationswere investigated by factors including macroscopic classification, maximumdiameter, depth of invasion, location, histological type and presence/absenceof accumulation of /sup 67/Ga-citrate. The degree of accumulation tendedto increase with increased maximum diameter and depth of invasion ofcarcinoma. All patients with increased accumulation showed infiltrationof a/sub 2/ (s) or ai (si). The results we obtained suggest that detectabilityof carcinoma of the colon by /sup 67/Ga scintigraphy in the present studywas better than previously believed. From the fact that all patientswith accumulation showed infiltration beyond the serosa, the procedurewas thought to be useful for evaluation of depth of invasion. In particular,it provided useful information in cases with severe stenosis or occlusion.</TEXT></DOC>
