Here, RF transmitters feed sound frequency impulsescompiled as telegrams into the network. RF receivers serve to detectand decode these telegrams and carry out the switching functions desired.Most of the RF receivers available on the market are now working on amicroprocessor basis; only the band-pass filter used for the selectionof the sound frequencies is still being made in analogue technique. Thefollowing article shows how this analogue band-pass filter can be replacedby a digital filter and which advantages are offered by this new method.</TEXT></DOC>
