The main target, according to the bill's sponsor, SalAlbanese, (D., Brooklyn), was to stop people age 18 oryounger from being tempted to smoke. Mr. Albanese saidcigarettes are distributed free on street corners and thatyoungsters can get them.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In ending this reprehensible practice,&quot; the Brooklynlegislator said, &quot;New York City will not only become thelargest jurisdiction in the nation to ban the freedistribution of tobacco products to the public, but as largeas the next six jurisdictions combined.&quot;   Mr. Albanese said at least 15 other cities, includingBoston, Atlanta, Cincinnati and Austin, Texas, also bar thefree distribution of cigarettes.   He said the legislation would bar individuals andbusinesses from distributing tobacco products in publicplaces or at public events for free or at any price less thanthe combined cost of the required taxes.   The bill still requires the approval of Mayor DavidDinkins.</TEXT></DOC>
