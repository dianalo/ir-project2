Rejecting attempts by news organizations to inspect thedocuments, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that thepublic has no right to such material, at least until a grand juryhas issued indictments.   The ruling upheld decisions by judges in Los Angeles and SanDiego.   Judge William Norris said the public's interest in observing thejudicial process is outweighed by the potential damage to aninvestigation, including the risk of evidence being destroyed andinnocent people being maligned.   More than a dozen people have been convicted or have pleadedguilty in the 2-year Operation Ill Wind probe, in which contractorsand consultants are accused of bribing Pentagon officials forinside information useful in winning contracts.   Federal prosecutors obtained 39 search warrants in 16 judicialdistricts around the country in June 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
