Strong adlayer-substrate bonding leadsto the formation of commensurate Pd or Pt overlayers at low coverage({theta} andless; 0.7 ML). Ni and Cu form incommensurate structures becausethe additional interfacial misfit cannot be overcome by substrate-overlayerbonding. Ag and Au form commensurate overlayers at coverages less than3 ML because the lattice misfit is small. The strong overlayer-substratebonding produces large changes in the chemical activity of near-noblemetal overlayers. Photoemission measurements on Pt monolayers show thatthe hybridized metal d-states are shifted further below the Fermi level&quot;E/sub F/&quot; and show a reduction in the surface density of states at E/subF/. This absence of bonding d-states near E/sub F/ effects CO chemisorption.However, as additional layers of Pd and Pt are deposited, the d-occupancy,at E/sub F/ grows, with &quot;constant&quot; atomic structure and the amount ofCO increases. Hence, in these systems chemisorption changes can be studiedas a function of changing electronic structure while holding the surfacestructure fixed.</TEXT></DOC>
