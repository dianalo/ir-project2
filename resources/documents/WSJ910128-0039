But total legal fees for the year may exceed $600 millionwhen the government tallies fees paid by thrifts inconservatorship as well as legal bills covered by agreementswith certain banks and thrifts, according to a senior FDICattorney who asked not to be identified.</LP><TEXT>   The attorney said that FDIC's preliminary estimates showthat legal fees for 1991 could reach $750 million as morebanks and thrifts succumb to recession and real estate loanwoes.   Last year's legal fees covered a wide range of matters forfailed banks and thrifts, ranging from high-profile suitsagainst former officers to mundane tasks, such as clearanceof titles to repossessed real estate.   The FDIC is also picking up the tab for certain legal workon behalf of such regional banking giants as NCNB Corp. andBanc One Corp., which entered into government-assistanceagreements when they acquired failed bank holding companies.   Some of the fees paid in 1990 were for law firms' work inprevious years. Fees also covered legal work that the FDICinherited from the defunct Federal Savings andamp; Loan InsuranceCorp. The FSLIC paid private lawyers more than $102 millionin 1989.   Still, the FDIC's legal bills are clearly growing. And theagency recently has formed task forces and a new section ofits in-house legal department to study ways to reduce fees.   The agency is also expected to start spreading its legalwork among more law firms. Under a draft of a policycurrently being considered, the FDIC would require approvalfrom its top management for any new legal assignments to alaw firm that had racked up $2 million in fees, according toFDIC assistant general counsel James Lantelme.   That policy would break up the current concentration ofwork among relatively few firms. Although the FDIC hasapproved 955 law firms to handle work, most receive little ornone. Last year, 21 law firms each received fees totalling $2million or more; of those, 10 firms each received $4 millionor more. The top 10 firms were paid a total of almost $90million, or about 30% of all fees paid for work atgovernment-controlled financial institutions.   The highest-paid law firm, Hopkins andamp; Sutter, receivedalmost $21.7 million last year. Robert Patterson, a seniortrial attorney at the Chicago-based firm, said the firm hasrepresented the government in thrift-related cases for 25years, concentrating on the liability of directors, officersand professional advisers.   Because of its long relationship with the government,Hopkins andamp; Sutter isn't expected to suffer under any new FDICpolicy for spreading the wealth. But many other law firms,such as 80-lawyer Jackson, Tufts, Cole andamp; Black in SanFrancisco, are at risk.   Jackson Tufts was paid $6.6 million last year forlitigating claims against former officers of the failedEureka Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of San Carlos,Calif. The law firm's managing partner, Kenneth Philpot, saidJackson Tufts won a settlement of $70 million for the FDIClast August.   &quot;The (FDIC) people we worked with in Washington said thatonce the case was over, we shouldn't expect more work becauseso much money had come our way,&quot; Mr. Philpot said. &quot;It lookslike (law firms are paid) a lot of taxpayer money, but in thecontext of big corporate litigation these days, it's notmuch.&quot;   ---         Most Highly Compensated Law Firms in 1990                                                                                                          In millions of dollars                                                                                                          Hopkins andamp; Sutter (Chicago)                   $21.7                                                                                                          Squire, Sanders andamp; Dempsey (Cleveland)        $12.5                                                                                                          Graham andamp; James (San Francisco)               $11.0                                                                                                          Arter andamp; Hadden (Cleveland, Dallas)           $10.5                                                                                                          Carlton, Fields, Ward, Emmanuel,   Smith andamp; Cutter (Tampa)                       $ 6.9                                                                                                          Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
