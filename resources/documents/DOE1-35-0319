High densities and confinement times should be reachedby the use of high magnetic fields (8T) and reduced size and a stronglower hybrid additional heating (8 MW at 8 GHz) will be applied to raiseplasma temperature. The main features of the machine are: liquid nitrogencooling, to reduce power and energy consumption, flexibility in plasmacurrent and position control, all stainless steel vacuum chamber, linerand limiter structures. The machine is presently in an advanced constructionstage and the first operation of the machine at room temperature shouldbe at the end of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
