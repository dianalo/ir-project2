KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> OXY LABORLABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department proposed a record $2.6 million fine against the IBP Inc. unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp. on charges of deliberately concealing worker injuries and illnesses at a Dakota City, Neb., beefpacking plant.    &quot;This case is the worst example of under-reporting injuries and illnesses to workers ever encountered by OSHA in its 16-year history,&quot; said John Pendergrass, a department assistant secretary.    The citation from the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged IBP, the nation's largest meatpacker, with willfully failing to record 1,038 job-related injuries and illnesses in 1985 and 1986, plus 181 other violations.    The company altered its injury and illness logs for those two years after denying federal inspectors access to the plant's records in December 1986, OSHA charged. In January 1987, a week before OSHA inspectors subpoenaed records, IBP assembled a 50-member task force to revise the logs, the agency charged.    Among the injuries cited by OSHA were knife cuts and wounds, concussions, burns, hernias and fractures.    In Dakota City, a spokesman for IBP said the company will contest the citation. &quot;We did not willfully violate OSHA's record-keeping requirements and we will not pay the proposed penalties,&quot; the company said in a prepared statement.    The company said the citation is only for alleged record-keeping violations and &quot;does not charge that IBP has disregarded the safety and health of its employees.&quot; IBP also said the charges are &quot;an indication of inconsistent enforcement by OSHA and the Labor Department of unclear legal requirements.&quot;    OSHA said it plans to conduct a full safety and health inspection of the Nebraska plant when production, now slowed by a labor-management dispute, returns to normal levels. OSHA had scheduled such an inspection earlier this year, because the plant's injury and illness rate was well above the national average for manufacturing, despite the alleged under-reporting. But the inspection was postponed because of a strike. More than 2,000 workers have since been locked out of the plant.    Recently, OSHA began a similar recordkeeping inspection at IBP's Emporia, Kan., plant.    The proposed fine is significantly higher than OSHA's previous record of $1.6 million, levied earlier this month against Chrysler Corp. for health and safety violations.    IBP has 15 working days to contest the OSHA citation and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. A willful violation is one in which an employer knew a violation occurred, or was aware an unsafe or unhealthy condition existed, and didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    OSHA has been looking into a complaint by the the United Food and Commercial Workers Union that IBP was violating federal record-keeping regulations on job injuries at the Dakota City plant. The union charges that IBP has gained industry dominance by cutting corners on working conditions.    After OSHA announced its proposal for the penalties against IBP, Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the House employment and housing subcommittee, said the company misled the House Government Operations Committee unit in hearings in May.    During those hearings, in the face of Rep. Lantos's allegations that IBP had an &quot;astronomical&quot; turnover rate, and suggestions of many &quot;injured or maimed&quot; workers, the company said that it was successfully campaigning to improve safety and that any record-keeping deficiencies stemmed from confusion as to what should be recorded. Officials testified that IBP had a good safety record and didn't intentionally under-report injuries or illnesses.    IBP said yesterday that it &quot;vigorously disputed any suggestion of knowingly giving false testimony.&quot;    A spokesman quoted IBP Chairman Robert L. Peterson as saying that &quot;when other IBP officials and I appeared before (the subcommittee) in May, we testified completely, openly and in good faith as to the facts as we understood them at the time.&quot; Later, when the executives learned some of that testimony wasn't correct, &quot;We moved immediately to provide this new information to the subcommittee,&quot; he said.    &quot;At all times,&quot; Mr. Peterson said, &quot;IBP and its senior management have acted in good faith.&quot; He said he was &quot;dismayed&quot; that Rep. Lantos issued a news release on the matter before the subcommittee &quot;had the opportunity to examine all the facts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
