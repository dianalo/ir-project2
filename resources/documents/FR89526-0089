The SP seeks a waiver of compliance with andSection; 232.12(b),which stipulates, ``Each carrier shall designate additional inspectionpoints not more than 1,000 miles apart where intermediate inspection willbe made to determine that_(1) Brake pipe leakage does not exceed five pounds per minute;(2) Brakes apply on each car in response to a 20-pound service brake pipepressure reduction; and(3) Brake rigging is properly secured and does not bind or foul.''The SP seeks to extend the intermediate air brake inspection by 250 milesfor trains operated between Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles or West Colton,California, on two routes, the San Joaquin Valley Route and the Coast Route.On the San Joaquin Route, where the distance varies from 1,077 miles to1,146 miles, the intermediate air brake inspection is performed at eitherEugene, Oregon or Roseville, California. On the Coast Route, where thedistance varies from 1,181 miles to 1,235 miles, the intermediate air brakeinspection is performed at Oakland, California.The railroad states the increased competition in the transportation industryrequires the railroad industry to take full advantage of every opportunitythat will improve service and reduce cost without affecting safety. Itgoes on to say that with the improved technology of air brakes and equipmentdesign, extending the intermediate air brake inspection 250 miles shouldnot be a safety issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Davenport, Rock Island and North Western Railway Company </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Waiver Petition Number LI-89-3]</ITAG>The Davenport, Rock Island and North Western Railway Company (DRIandamp;NW)requests a waiver of compliance with a provision of the railroad locomotivesafety standards (49 CFR 229.117) for its five locomotives. The DRIandamp;NWlocomotives are switcher type locomotives, Model SW-1200, built in 1950by the Electro Motive Division of the General Motors Corporation. Theyare numbered 107, 108, 109, 121 and 602. None of the locomotives is presentlyequipped, nor were they ever equipped, with speed indicators.The DRIandamp;NW requests a waiver of andSection; 229.117(a), which requiresin part that, ``After December 31, 1980, each locomotive used as a controllinglocomotive at speeds in excess of 20 miles per hour shall be equipped witha speed indicator  * * *.'' The DRIandamp;NW is a switching railroad thatoperates in the Quad Cities area (Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa and RockIsland, Moline, East Moline and Silvis, Illinois). The railroad normallyoperates three switching assignments per day. For seven months of the year,the DRIandamp;NW operates entirely within yard limits and the locomotivesdo not exceed a speed of 20 mph. For five months, the railroad will makefive trips per week to an industry located 19.5 miles outside yard limits.Those movements would be made at a speed not to exceed 40 mph, althoughthe timetable allows a maximum authorized speed of 49 mph. The authorityfor movement on the main track is by track warrant. The DRIandamp;NW maintrack is used by the Soo Line Railroad (Soo Line) as part of its Chicagoto Kansas City main line. All movements over the DRIandamp;NW main trackare under the control of the Soo Line train dispatcher.The railroad states that it would be an excessive financial burden to equipits locomotives with speed indicators for a movement that represents onlya small percentage of locomotive service hours for the year. Furthermore,the movement is being done for the Soo Line, which is a co-owner of theDRIandamp;NW. It is possible that at any time the Soo Line could resume theswitching of the industry, which would make the speed indicators superfluous.<ITAG tagnum="84">Long Island Rail Road </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Waiver Petition Docket Number LI-89-2]</ITAG>The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) requests a waiver of compliance with aprovision of the railroad locomotive safety standards regulation (49 CFR229.81(b)), which states that, ``Each locomotive equipped with third-railshoes shall have a device for insulating the current collecting apparatusfrom the third rail.'' The LIRR seeks this waiver for its fleet of 174M-3 ``Metropolitan'' self-propelled passenger transit cars. These carsare defined as MU locomotives in the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFRSection 229.5(j)).The LIRR's justification is that a current waiver, FRA Docket Number LI-80-15,covers its fleet of 764 M-1 MU locomotives. The railroad states that theoperation of the M-3 MU locomotives is identical to the M-1 MU locomotiveswith respect to isolation from third-rail power.As stated by the railroad in its petition, the procedure to isolate bothM-1 and M-3 MU locomotives from third-rail power is as follows: 1. One power control center controls all third-rail power. This enablesthe power director to shut off any section of third-rail power almost instantaneously,anywhere in the LIRR.2. The entire third-rail system is electrically protected by a ``faultsensing pilot wire.'' This pilot wire detects high resistance ground faultsand does not require high amperage overloads to trip the third-rail circuitbreakers.3. All M-1 and M-3 electric MU locomotives and all diesel locomotives haveradio communication with the train dispatchers, interlocking towers andother trains. This allows all trains on the LIRR to report any electricalpower problems direct to the train dispatcher and have the immediate removalof power from any section of the third rail.The procedure for having the third-rail power shut off is covered by theLIRR operating rules and does not require the train crews to go near theenergized third-rail to remove power from the MU locomotive.It is the opinion of the railroad that its present procedure for havingpower removed from the third-rail is a safer method for the train crewto use, than to try to isolate the third-rail shoe of the MU locomotivefrom the third-rail by using a third-rail shoe insulator.Therefore, the LIRR requests that it be granted a permanent waiver of compliancewith andSection; 229.81(b) allowing the railroad to operate the M-3 MU locomotivefleet without the required insulating apparatus on board each vehicle.Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submittingwritten views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling apublic hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts donot appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested parties desire an opportunityfor oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end ofthe comment period and specify the basis for their request.All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriatedocket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number PB-89-2) and must besubmitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FederalRailroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,DC 20590. Communications received before July 13, 1989 will be consideredby FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that datewill be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerningthese proceedings are available for examination during regular businesshours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in Room 8201 Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street,SW., Washington, DC 20590.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on May 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
