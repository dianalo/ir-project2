Three major energy sourcesof electric power are compared: nuclear, coal and oil. It also discussesthe requirement for replacing existing nuclear power plants in OECD countriesas a function of plant useful life. Although it is difficult to takeinto account specific conditions for each OECD country, generally speaking,plant life extension is a very important factor for the future developmentof nuclear power. If the plant useful life of existing nuclear powerplants is extended from 30 years to 40 years, the need of replacing existingnuclear power plants with new ones in the coming 25 years could be reducedsubstantially. Extension of plant life with neither incremental capitalnor O and M costs will reduce the generating cost of nuclear power plantsby several per cent and could be an important option for future electricitytariff reductions in countries where dependency on nuclear power is high.</TEXT></DOC>
