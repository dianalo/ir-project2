<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0177 </DOCNO><TEXT>The simplicity of the leading-order production processes for direct (single)gamma production in pp and {bar p}p collisions, i.e. the QCD-Comptonprocess qg {yields} {gamma}q and the annihilation process qq {gamma}g,is appealing, since the photon carries all the p{sub T} of the partoncollision, and there is no confusion from fragmentation. Furthermorethe ratio R = {sigma}({bar p}p {yields}{gamma}X)/{sigma}(pp {yields}{gamma}X) should be sensitive to the hardness of the gluon structure fucntionof the nucleon. Since qq annihilation is clearly more important in {barp}p than pp, due to the valence q quarks, R is expected to be largerthan one, and since the gluon structure function is known to be relativelysoft so that {bar q}q should become increasingly favoured over qg asp{sub T} of the emitted gamma ray. Experiment UA6 at CERN is a fixed-targetexperiment using a hydrogen gas jet target in the SPS Collider {bar p}(orp) beam to study high p {sub T} {pi} {degree}, {eta}, and {gamma} productionin {bar p}p and pp collisions at {radical} s = 24.3 GeV (when the Colliderbeam momenta are 315 GeV/c). Electron pairs, including J/{psi} {yields}e{sup +}e{sup {minus}}, can be studied. The collaborating institutesare CERN, the University of Lausanne, the University of Michigan, andThe Rockefeller University.</TEXT></DOC>
