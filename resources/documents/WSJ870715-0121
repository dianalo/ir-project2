Mr. Kalliel, a flamboyant Texan who whirled across the Farm Belt promoting a sweeping bailout plan for troubled farmers, was the subject of a page one story in The Wall Street Journal in August 1985.    Mr. Kalliel was convicted of 19 counts of wire fraud and one count of providing a false financial statement to a federally insured bank. His attorney, Milton Skeens, says Mr. Kalliel plans to appeal the verdict.    The charges -- and two separate suits filed against Mr. Kalliel by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- stem from Mr. Kalliel's dealings with the Rexford State Bank of Rexford, Kan. According to the FDIC suits, the bank allegedly failed because of loans made to financially troubled farmers -- guaranteed by one of Mr. Kalliel's companies -- and to Mr. Kalliel or his related businesses. Almost all of those loans eventually entered default.    Donald Foster, the Justice Department attorney who tried the criminal case, said Mr. Kalliel's financial statement put his net worth at $84 million when it was actually negative. Net worth is assets minus liabilities. Mr. Kalliel had given his financial statement to the bank when he convinced the bank to make the loans backed by his guarantees.    In 1986, the FDIC won a default judgment totaling nearly $9 million in actual and punitive damages in a collection and fraud case it brought against Mr. Kalliel, according to an FDIC attorney. Early this year in a related racketeering case, the second of its suits, the agency also won a default judgment against Mr. Kalliel; the amount of that judgment hasn't yet been set, the attorney said.    Mr. Kalliel and the attorney who represented him in the FDIC cases couldn't be located to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
