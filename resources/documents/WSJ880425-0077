But when his son, a college senior, recently told him he was considering government service, Mr. Puritano advised against it. He argued that too many high government posts have become jobs in which civil servants are demeaned and left with little or no authority.    The federal government is grappling with a growing problem of hiring and retaining top-quality managers and professionals. The problem, according to former civil servants and several commissions studying the issue, involves both morale and money. They say career managers are poorly paid, rarely appreciated and frequently passed over as the better government jobs go to political appointees.    &quot;No chief executive officer in the private sector would ever say what the last two presidents have said: in essence that they have a lousy bunch of jerks working for them,&quot; says Mr. Puritano. &quot;The low pay is only the straw that breaks the camel's back.&quot;    Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volker says many of the first-class people left in government are there by accident and there are too few managers of equal ability ready to take over when they leave. To emphasize the problem, he's serving as chairman of the National Commission on the Public Service, a private group organized to highlight the issue during the presidential campaign.    The ranks of career civil servants in the Senior Executive Service, an organization created to boost the salaries of the top-level federal managers, have declined steadily since it was created in 1979, dropping an average 9% annually. (Political appointees may join SES but can't exceed 10% of total membership.) In recent surveys, only about a third or less of SES executives questioned have said they would recommend a government service career to young people. While about 61% say they're dissatisfied with federal salary levels, 90% are disturbed by the public image of federal workers.    The nation's interests are harmed when the government can't attract the best people for its most critical functions, argues former Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. In 1986, he says, hundreds of candidates responded to his ads for experienced industrial managers to run the Navy's shipyards. He says he was unable to get any of them to accept a job. &quot;Once they saw the salary and the government's conflict-of-interest rules and other restrictions, I couldn't even hire one of them,&quot; says Mr. Lehman, now PaineWebber Inc.'s managing director for investment banking.    And Jack Townsend, director of the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center, believes management problems played a big role in the Challenger disaster. &quot;One of the tragedies is that the problems with the booster-rocket joints didn't get reported up high enough. If NASA had had the caliber of people it should have had then, the problem would have been focused on and the Challenger accident wouldn't have happened in the same way,&quot; he concludes.    While some argue that fattening the pay envelopes of the government's top staffers would quickly ease the situation, pay levels aren't the first complaint of those frustrated federal managers. Instead, they worry that years of service to the government might not be seen as challenging or useful work.    After four years as a civil servant, first at the Office of Management and Budget and now as the Treasury's legislative director, Scott Cleland has decided he'll seek work in the private sector within a year or two. &quot;I enjoy what I do, but I have to be pragmatic about my career. If I wait and have 10 to 15 years under my belt, private employers will view me as an entrenched bureaucrat who knows nothing else but the government,&quot; explains Mr. Cleland.    For managers and professionals who stay with the government, pay levels eventually gain in importance. Salaries for members of the Senior Executive Service range from $66,000 at level one to $77,500 at the top level, six. Comparable jobs in the private sector pay from 24% to 65% more, says the President's Commission on Compensation of Career Federal Executives. In recent years, most pay increases for these civil servants have tracked or fallen below inflation rates. Mr. Lehman calls the SES salary system &quot;the most socialist pay scale in the world.&quot;    Wendy Samuel, a lawyer who was a deputy division director with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, says money was the reason she left that job after 12 years as a civil servant. &quot;People just out of law school were making what I did at the time,&quot; she explained.    Mr. Volcker talks about another reason good people are leaving the government: A greater share of the policy-making jobs in the executive branch have gone to political appointees in recent years. &quot;Talented people are going to be attracted by a sense of responsibility and of solving real problems as well as by salary,&quot; he says.    Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), chairman of the House civil service subcommittee, has proposed legislation to limit the number of political appointees to top government posts and to create a scholarship program, similar to the military's Reserve Officer Training Corps, for college students who will commit themselves to a period of federal service.    &quot;There's no way the government can ever compete (with the private sector) on bonuses and stock options,&quot; says Mr. Puritano. &quot;But geez, there are such important jobs in government. If we keep neglecting the civil service, who's going to do them except those who can't go anywhere else?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
