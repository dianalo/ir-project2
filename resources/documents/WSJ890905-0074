But all the uproar over the dial-a-porn issues in Sable Communications of California v. FCC obscured one aspect of the ruling that could have far-reaching implications for the future of free expression. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his concurring opinion, &quot;while we hold the Constitution prevents Congress from banning indecent speech in this fashion, we do not hold that the Constitution requires public utilities to carry it.&quot; In other words, the telephone company may ban dial-a-porn message service even if the government may not.    This conclusion follows from the basic principle that the First Amendment prohibits only state action, not decisions made by private entities. But unlike other private businesses, telephone companies are given a monopoly franchise in their local exchange areas and guaranteed a profit. They also are required by law to provide service to all who reasonably request it, without discrimination among customers.    This obligation to serve all potential clients does not require phone companies to aid and abet violations of the law. Courts have long held, for example, that phone service can be denied to bookies or others engaged in illegal gambling. Justice Scalia is now saying that telephone companies are free to treat dial-a-porn providers as if they were law breakers.    The two federal appellate courts that have decided the issue so far have held that phone companies may deny service to certain customers in order to protect their corporate reputations. And last week, a federal district court in San Francisco upheld Pacific Bell's right to disconnect dial-a-porn services. As one of the appellate courts put it, &quot;a private business is free to choose the content of messages with which its name and reputation will be associated.&quot;    But the telephone company, after all, is the only game in town. And its decisions often appear to be motivated by more than just private business judgment. For example, Southern Bell dropped dial-a-porn service in 1986 after the Florida Public Service Commission hinted broadly that it would be more likely to approve a proposed tariff if adult-oriented services were excluded. And in Arizona, a single letter from a local prosecutor prompted Mountain States Telephone in 1985 to terminate service to one dial-a-porn provider and then to ban all &quot;adult&quot; services from its network.    Measures short of an outright prohibition are sometimes adopted. Some carriers, such as Bell Atlantic, have opted for pre-subscription blocking, which requires dial-a-porn aficionados to sign up in advance before access is provided. Others simply decline to provide billing services for disfavored operators.    Protecting the &quot;corporate reputation&quot; can mean more than just disassociating the carrier from heavy breathers. As if to test the limits of this justification, Michigan Bell refuses to provide billing services for customers whose messages are &quot;inflammatory and likely to offend ethnic, gender, racial or religious groups; lewd, lascivious, indecent, or obscene . . . or are likely to have a detrimental effect on Michigan Bell's image or reputation.&quot; Pacific Bell adopted similar guidelines that allow it to terminate billing for any &quot;harmful&quot; service.    It is difficult to imagine recorded messages that would not be offensive to some interest group or would not reflect in some way on the carrier's image. As a special FCC report published in November 1988 asked rhetorically, &quot;does this mean that Michigan Bell could refuse to bill for a 976 audiotex consumer hotline that consistently complained about the telephone company's rates and service?&quot;    This problem expands as telephone companies branch out into new information services. Carriers are beginning to develop videotex &quot;gateways&quot; through which information services are transmitted to personal computers. But they are also developing new ways to screen out &quot;offensive&quot; communications. Speaking at the July 1989 conference of the Videotex Industry Association, the director of gateway services for Southwestern Bell said his company was using on-line monitors to &quot;check for four-letter words&quot; during online conferences at its Houston test system. A representative of U.S. West similarly acknowledged that there will be &quot;some monitoring&quot; of videotex services on that carrier's Omaha system. Both carriers are prohibiting adult videotex as well.    The main challenge to freedom of expression will arise as telephone companies begin to provide cable television service. Right now, the terms of the ATandamp;T breakup bar the former Bell operating companies from doing so and most other telephone companies are prevented from offering such service by the 1984 Cable Act. But ATandamp;T consent decree restrictions are currently being challenged at the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. In addition, legislation is now pending in both houses of Congress to permit telephone companies to offer cable service. The FCC also has suggested that Congress should lift Cable Act restrictions, although it has not yet made a formal recommendation. But Alfred Sikes, the new chairman of the FCC, has said he plans to make telephone entry into cable a top priority.    When that happens, particularly as the telephone companies install fiber optic lines, alternative means of delivering video signals to the home may well atrophy. Economics could force existing cable operators to purchase excess transmission capacity from the telephone companies rather than maintain a separate coaxial cable system.    Even traditional broadcasters will be affected. Motorola Chairman Robert Galvin has argued that broadcasters should turn in their licenses and become program suppliers over fiber optic systems. Similarly, the FCC's Office of Plans and Policy has stated that as new broadband networks develop, broadcasters may be in trouble if &quot;they see their business as emitting nonionizing radiation from the tops of red and white towers.&quot; Rather, it suggests that broadcasters should concentrate on &quot;producing, selecting, and packaging television programming&quot; for fiber optic networks.    Telephone companies are likely to be just as squeamish about video programming as they have been about dial-a-porn and videotex. And as Justice Scalia reminded us in Sable Communications nothing requires the phone companies to carry programming they don't like. More than the Playboy Channel is at risk. Unless conditions for the entry of telephone companies into new markets are carefully crafted, the new information age could make the First Amendment obsolete.    ---   Mr. Corn-Revere is a lawyer in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
