Apparently not. The lack of attention to such activities suggeststo some critics that corporate insiders may have found the best dealfor themselves since at least the early 1930s and maybe since theturn of the century.   Executives are the ultimate insiders. Not only do they haveaccess to secrets _ sales expectations, new products, long-termprospects _ they have the power to do things with those secrets.   In contrast, most of those recently prosecuted as insiders havebeen relatively passive, making money by investing and then waitingfor others to put into motion the corporate changes that would makeprices rise.   Executive insiders have both the information and the means tomake things happen, and those two factors are involved in almostevery instance when they make a leveraged buyout offer to their ownshareholders.   The situation seems to be stirring more anger among bedazzledshareholders than among regulators, and that stirring _ in lettersto newspapers, among investment groups, in shareholder conversations_ may erupt in legal action.   Among questions commonly being discussed:   _Were corporate officers, managers paid by the shareholders,looking after their own or the shareholders' interests?   _Did they maneuver the company's activities for their own orshareholder interest?   _Were they direct in their communications with investors,employees and their own boards of directors _ who are committed bylaw to the shareholders' interests _ or did they purposely witholdinformation on their intentions?   At the extreme is the question of whether managements haveactively plotted to maintain corporate operations at a depressedlevel in order to obtain a low buyout price, knowing they couldimprove operations at a later date.   Individual shareholders have been weak in dealing with suchmatters over the years, but in the past decade or so they havebecome better organized into effective forces.   More significant, however, has been the growth of institutions,which now do most of the stock trading on organized exchanges andconstitute enormous concentrations of funds for credit markets.   Some of these institutions, such as pension funds and collegeendowments, have seen the value of their bond investments plummentafter the management of companies in which they invested announcedleveraged buyout plans.   The demoralizing impact on bond prices generally has not receivedthe same publicity afforded the run-up in stock prices. But the bondmarket impact has been severe; new debt needed to accomplish aleveraged buyout causes the value of existing bonds to decline,badly affecting the bond portfolios of investors.   One such bondholder, ITT Corp., filed suit this week against RJRNabisco Inc., claiming RJR management failed to disclose it wasconsidering a leveraged buyout when it sold RJR bonds to ITT lastApril. ITT lost heavily.   While some buyouts and unfriendly takeovers can have beneficialeffects for the company, its shareholders, employees and community,a large percentage of them lead to fractured feelings, portfoliosand even the companies themselves.   While it might seem that laws and regulations on insideractivities would apply, events suggest it is a no-man's land.   It might take a series of these events, such as ITT's suit, toclarify matters and provide rules and guidance where they seem notto exist.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday Nov 18</NOTE></DOC>
