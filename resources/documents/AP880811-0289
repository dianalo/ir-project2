The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly100 points over the five previous sessions, rose 5.16 to 2,039.30.   But declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 innationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with666 up, 828 down and 502 unchanged.   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173 million shares,against 200.95 million in the previous session. Nationwide,consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades inthose stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-countermarket, totaled 201.30 million shares.   Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushedprices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for``bargains.''   But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recentrise in interest rates.   Many large banks across the country raised their prime lendingrates Thursday from 9.5 percent to 10 percent, two days after theFederal Reserve increased the rate it charges on loans to privatefinancial institutions.   The timing of the Federal Reserve's increase in its discountrate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent suggested to many Wall Streetersthat the Fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becomingmore aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up.   For one thing, the rate increase came just as the Treasury wasbeginning a quarterly sale of debt securities.   Gainers among the blue chips that make up the Dow includedInternational Business Machines, up [ at 119; Eastman Kodak, up ~at 43]; General Motors, up [ at 75~, and American Express, up { at28.
