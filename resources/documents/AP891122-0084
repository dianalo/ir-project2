ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Some travelers beat the pre-Thanksgiving rush by getting onplanes, trains and automobiles early, while harsh weather _ alreadyblamed for 14 deaths in four states _ caused delays today.   Airports braced for the stampede of people heading home today,traditionally one of the heaviest travel days of the year.   Six people were killed in separate traffic accidents on snowyroads in Minnesota on Tuesday. The storm snarled evening rush-hourtraffic in the Twin Cities area and up to 6 inches of snow coatedparts of North Dakota today.   Eight deaths were blamed on high wind, slick roads or cold inPennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maryland.   And more than 200 Newark, N.J., residents were left homeless bytwo wind-blown fires that destroyed a row of houses and anapartment building.   Edith and George Webber of rural Black Earth, Wis., had noworries as they avoided the crunch and took a flight Monday toWashington National Airport. They were being met by their son wholives in Towson, Md.   ``We offered to bring the turkey and he said `never mind,' so webrought some Wisconsin cheese and some jams and stuff,'' said the73-year-old Webber.   Angela Ploof, 18, who works as a nanny in Bedford, N.Y., alsoavoided the rush by leaving earlier this week for home in Mosinee,Wis.   ``It's a surprise for my mom,'' she said. ``It'll be a totalshock.''   For today's travelers, the possibility of snow loomed overseveral key airports.   ``The weather reports for our four hubs _ Chicago, Denver,Washington, D.C., and San Francisco _ indicates the possibility forlight snow to fall in three of those areas, with fog in SanFrancisco,'' said Rob Doughty, spokesman for United Airlines, thelargest carrier at Chicago's O'Hare and the nation's second-largest.   ``There is the potential for some delays across the system,'' hesaid. ``When the weather affects the system, there's not a wholelot any of us can do about it.''   Light snow caused slight delays this morning at O'Hare, and theFederal Aviation Administration implemented a nationwide airtraffic quota system, which keeps airplanes on the ground untilweather improves near their destinations.   Dense fog had cut visibility to near zero Tuesday afternoon atSalt Lake City's airport. The only planes allowed to land werethose equipped with new radar, said airport operations managerFrank Ratliffe. The fog also contributed to commuter-hour accidentson freeways, but none involved serious injuries.   An estimated 210,000 people today were expected to pass throughO'Hare, the world's busiest airport. It usually handles about160,000 per day.   ``We advise that because of the volume of traffic, that peopleleave earlier than usual for the airport,'' said Lisa Howard,spokeswoman for the Chicago's Department of Aviation. ``And priorto leaving, check with the airlines.''   Los Angeles International Airport Manager Stephen Yee similarlyurged travelers to arrive at least two hours before domesticflights and three for international flights to allow for long linesat baggage check-in, ticket counters and passenger screening points.   He also warned that closures in long-term parking facilitieswere likely and urged travelers to use commuter shuttles.   Maynard Scarborough, spokesman for Boston's Logan airport, saida new program this year called ``Meet and Greet'' encourages peopleto leave their cars at lots in the suburbs.   ``People who park there are given a bus ticket which enablesthem to ride into Logan on the bus at half-price, meet a travelerwho pays full fare and ride back,'' he said.   The Baltimore-Washington Airport recruited Maryland AviationAdministration employees to volunteer as ``holiday helpers'' forthe third year.   The volunteers will be posted at busy locations to answerquestions and offer assistance to travelers.   Amtrak reservations on the Seattle-to-San Francisco andSeattle-to-Chicago runs today and Sunday have been sold out for twomonths, said spokesman Art Lloyd.   In New Jersey, one of the weather-related deaths occurred when atree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal as shewas getting out of her car at her elementary school. And aBaltimore woman died when a warehouse fell on her house.   An 83-year-old woman in East Providence, R.I., suffered brokenbones in a fall, possibly caused by high wind, and died afterseveral hours outside in cold and rain, officials said.   In Newark, Red Cross officials were attempting to find shelterfrom the blustery weather for the 200 people displaced by thefires. One of the fires apparently was started in abandonedbuildings by a homeless person trying to keep warm, authoritiessaid. The other blaze was arson, authorities said.   Diane Curry, a first-floor resident of a burnt-out building,fled safely through a window with her three children and pets.   ``Everything's gone,'' she said. ``I'll stay with my sisteruntil I can be relocated.''</TEXT></DOC>
