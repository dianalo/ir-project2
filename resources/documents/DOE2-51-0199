The resultsof the inverted impact arrangement are discussed with regard to attainableimprovements in comparison with the traditional impact arrangement. Theresults of the dynamic interaction of multiple cracks sometimes showedconsiderably changed stress conditions in comparison with the statics.Occurring shear stress (mode II shares) can be of essentially greaterimportance in the dynamic case. A simple test arrangement is suggested,which permits a determination of dynamic material indices with high modeII shares. (orig./HP) With 50 figs., 3 tabs., 44 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
