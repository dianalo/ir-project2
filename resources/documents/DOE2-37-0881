<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0881 </DOCNO><TEXT>The statistics of natural gas production is, different from that of theused amount, rather inaccurate because the large amount of the burnedgas can not be identified. The discovered quantity of 150 - 200 billioncf far exceeds the yearly production of 70 - 90 billion cf. The ultimateminable natural gas is estimated as approximately between 8,000 to 12,000billion cf, although the variance of the estimation may be larger thanthat of the crude oil. The ratios of the associated gas and unassociatedgas are approximately 15:85. The amount of gas expected to be developedin the future, together with the undiscovered gas, is enormous. Eventhe increase in the future demand is taken into consideration, the productionhas the capacity enough and to spare, and gas is expected to continueto be one of the important energy sources. Summarized explanation ismade on the situation of non-conventional type gases and the deep earthgas. (4 figs, 17 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
