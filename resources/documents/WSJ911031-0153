The Fed allowed a key short-term rate to drop, leadingmany market analysts to conclude that the central bank haseased credit. Although a formal decision wasn't made, thecentral bank is clearly in the process of lowering its targetfor the federal funds interest rate to 5% from 5 1/4%,officials said.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed's move may lead banks to reduce the prime lendingrate in coming days from 8%. &quot;Banks might lower the primenext week by a quarter of a percentage point to take a littlepolitical pressure off,&quot; predicts David Wyss, researchdirector of DRI Inc. The Bush administration has beencritical of banks for restraining credit.   However, if banks do cut rates, Mr. Wyss says, most aren'tlikely to do so before next week. That is because manyadjustable-rate loans are adjusted on the first day of themonth, and any reduction in the rate next week wouldn'taffect such loans until December. First Fidelity Bancorp ofNew Jersey jumped the gun Tuesday by announcing aquarter-point cut in its prime rate, to 7.75%.   Some analysts believe the Fed will give Chairman AlanGreenspan authority for further reductions at a meeting ofthe central bank's policy committee Tuesday. &quot;I wouldn't ruleout that at the meeting they will decide to do more,&quot; saysDarwin Beck, a Fed analyst at First Boston. Indeed, Mr. Becksays that if the economic news continues to be grim, theFed's easing moves may become more frequent.   Mr. Greenspan signaled his renewed concern about theeconomy in comments to Rhode Island business leaders Monday,when he said the economy was &quot;demonstrably sluggish&quot; and the&quot;spark&quot; it had exhibited in the spring was now gone.   &quot;The economy is evidently still rising, but at a pacesignificantly slower than after recovering from a recession,&quot;he said.   The Fed's action came just one day after the CommerceDepartment said the economy grew at a 2.4% pace in theJulySeptember quarter, following three quarters of decline.But that optimistic report appears to reflect a forgotten bitof history. Reports of more recent activity show, among otherthings, that orders for bigticket durable goods, which arewatched closely by Mr. Greenspan, dropped in September forthe second month in a row. And consumer confidence nose-divedin October.   The move to lower rates appears to mark a significantchange in Mr. Greenspan's attitude. At the Fed's policycommittee meeting Oct. 1, the Fed chairman was relativelysanguine about the course of the economic recovery, accordingto those who attended, while other Fed officials expressedgreater concern. Many of the district Federal Reserve Bankpresidents, who resisted moves to cut interest rates early inthe recession, are now concerned about the economy, in partbecause of the gloomy reports they are hearing from theirdirectors and from other regional businessmen. &quot;If there's arecovery out there, my directors don't see it,&quot; said onedistrict Fed official.   At the Oct. 1 meeting, the committee gave Mr. Greenspanauthority to cut short-term interest rates, at hisdiscretion. Until now, however, the Fed chairman chose not touse that discretionary authority.   Some Fed analysts expressed surprise that Mr. Greenspandidn't delay his move until Tuesday, when the Fed's policycommittee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, meetsto set policy for the coming weeks. But Tuesday also marksthe beginning of the Treasury's quarterly note and bond sale,and Fed officials said that the central bank likes to avoidchanging interest rates in the middle of a Treasury auction.</TEXT></DOC>
