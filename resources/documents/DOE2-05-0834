<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0834 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is presented to analyze the health risks associated with a combinationof insults, such as exposures to complex organic mixtures. The approachis phenomenological, has no built-in restrictions, and treats synergisticand antagonistic interactions between effects of various toxicants ina general manner. The only restrictions arise from the finite size ofthe set of functions used to describe the cause-effect relationshipswith low doses and minimal effects. Examples with two complex mixturesinvolve analyses of data on oral and esophageal cancer associated withchronic consumption of alcohol and tobacco. An example of combined exposureto a complex mixture and a specific toxicant involves analysis of lungcancer incidence in uranium miners who smoke. Finally, this formalismwill be used to plan cost-effective experiments involving two toxicantsor two mixtures of toxicants.</TEXT></DOC>
