Billy Hendon and three relatives of U.S. servicemen missing inaction left the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in mild weather on a65-foot boat that once carried Vietnamese refugees to asylum in thisBritish colony.   Hendon said late Thursday he plans to sail at least 200 milessouth of Hong Kong to encounter air currents that will send theballoons to Laos and Vietnam, where he believes hundreds of missingAmericans remain imprisoned 14 years after the war in Indochinaended.   The balloons will carry messages that say in local languages:``Bring an American prisoner to freedom and you will receive a hugeprize in return,'' Hendon said.   He said anyone who can free and bring to U.S. custody an Americanprisoner of war would get a $2.4 million reward, pledged by 21members of Congress and others.   ``This is no joke, we're spending a lot of time and a lot ofeffort here,'' said Hendon, who previously traveled to Thailand tofloat balloons with the reward offer down the Mekong River, whichforms the border with Laos.   ``We're not here to argue whether POWs are still there or not. Weare convinced they are,'' he said. ``Our job is to help solve thedilemma.''   The U.S. government says it has been unable to prove thatAmericans remain captive from the war in Indochina. But it says thepossibility cannot be discounted and investigations continue.   The United States has criticized the reward offer as a hindranceto official contacts with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to resolve thefates of 2,383 Americans listed as missing in action. The Communistnations have reacted angrily to the reward offer and have stronglydenied holding any Americans.   Hendon, 44, a two-term Republican congressman from North Carolinawho was defeated in 1986, is a member of a POW Publicity Fund formedby families of missing men and others to advertise the reward offer.   Accompanying Hendon are Elizabeth Stewart of Washington, BobbyBischoff of Wilson, N.C., and Jeffrey Donahue of Cocoa Beach, Fla.,whose fathers are among the U.S. servicemen reported missing inaction. The group expects to return to Hong Kong on Sunday.   Hendon said he visited Hong Kong's Royal Observatory twice beforeleaving to study weather data and acknowledged it will be tricky toland the messages in Indochina during the weekend trip.   ``It's sort of like shooting a basketball for a goal a mileaway,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
