Elsewhere, the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to policeand was ordered held on $1 million bond.   Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from PrinceWilliam Sound, but progress was slow and the oil had spread over anarea larger than Delaware. The animal death toll rose and salmonhatcheries remained endangered.   In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said he asked Coast GuardRear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr. to take over the much-maligned andslowly progressing cleanup effort from Exxon, and Nelson indicatedhe would, although he has not formally approved the request.   Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handlecoordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which hesaid was too bureaucratic.   ``Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a militarysystem to get things done,'' the governor said.   ``We appreciate the efforts of Exxon _ we think they were donein good faith. But we think there has to be a much more disciplinedmanagement structure,'' Cowper said at a Capitol news conference.   President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officialsto Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanupwasn't necessary. Cowper said Coast Guard management is differentfrom the plan Bush rejected.   Although Cowper said he didn't want to be ``extremely critical''of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmentalofficial said Exxon had been unresponsive.   ``Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary tomake sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oiland the protection of resources,'' wrote Lynn Kent, chief of thestate Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section.   Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed withcharges it wasn't handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxonwas the best organization to manage the effort.   ``We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. Wethink the most effective and efficient way to carry out thisproject is (for Exxon) to continue,'' Beathard said.   Fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to policeon New York's Long Island and a judge set bail at $1 million bondor $500,000 in cash, up from a prosecutor's recommendation of$25,000. He had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant onmisdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk.   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never beenequaled, at least in this country,'' Judge Kenneth Rohl said asHazelwood was arraigned. ``He's got to think about that. We have amanmade destruction that has not been equaled, probably, sinceHiroshima.''   Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million shipand floated it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez.From there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of sixtugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs,picking its way through scattered icebergs.   ``No pollution was immediately visible. There's a real goodpossibility (oil) sheen will show up, but they're ready for it,''Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt said.   The ship was refloated at 10:35 a.m., hours before the tidereached its peak Wednesday.   ``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company hastalked with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singapore aboutaccepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made.   First choice is a Portland, Ore., dry dock, Iarossi said, butOregon officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship.Iarossi said the ship won't trail any pollution while it is towed.   Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles ofbeach and killed thousands of animals, including at least 30 seaotters, officials said.   ``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.   Favorable weather, however, has kept it offshore from a nationalpark and additional coastline outside Prince William Sound.   Flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal dailyflow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline ServiceCo. said. Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percentbecause the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, buttraffic has increased.   In Washington, Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine accusedthe federal government of covering up the possibility of a majorspill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology. The CaliforniaDemocrats also asked President Bush to cancel oil leasing off theCalifornia coast pending a review of the program.   Hazelwood turned himself in with three attorneys in Hauppauge,N.Y., and was arraigned. His lawyer said he had not decided whetherto waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face thecharges.   Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under theinfluence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent dischargeof oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2\ years inprison and a $10,000 fine.   FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigatingwhether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of theClean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutantsinto navigable waters.   Hazelwood was fired by Exxon a week ago after the NationalTransportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours afterthe disaster showed he was drunk.   Hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and hadhis license suspended three times. His mother has told TheAssociated Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and thatExxon was aware of his drinking problem.   Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill andnow requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,four hours before sailing.   One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly fromfishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far. At least 14 lawsuitshave been filed.</TEXT></DOC>
