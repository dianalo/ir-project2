Named in the 49-count indictment were Jeffrey S. Worthy,33 years old, a former vice president and director offinancial planning at Columbia, who left the company in early1988, and Michael E. Parker, 43, who resigned late last yearas chairman of Parker Automotive Corp., based in Costa Mesa,Calif. The two were charged with racketeering, moneylaundering, payment and receipt of kickbacks, bank fraud andtax evasion.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Parker sold the lease packages as tax shelters toColumbia through a separate company called Parker NorthAmerican Corp., which is now in bankruptcy-law proceedings.The lease packages supposedly included equipment that ParkerNorth American had leased to banks and thrifts, includingautomated teller machines, but &quot;many of these lease packageswere either based on equipment and leases that did not existor on lease contracts in which PNA fraudulently increased thevalue of the equipment and the monthly lease payments,&quot; U.S.investigators said.   Mr. Worthy allegedly received about $1.5 million inkickbacks from Mr. Parker in exchange for his assistance inreviewing and recommending that Columbia buy the leasepackages, the indictment alleges. Columbia, which was seizedby federal regulators last month after failing to sell offits badly devalued junk-bond portfolio, paid $31 million incash and the balance in nonrecourse notes for the $166million of lease packages, investigators said. Mr. Parkerallegedly diverted more than $11 million of this money tohimself, certain associates and Mr. Worthy.   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it is seeking $25million in restitution from Messrs. Worthy and Parker, aswell as from Brian W. Fink, 42, a former Parker NorthAmerican vice president who was charged yesterday in aseparate federal indictment with tax evasion and conspiringin the scheme.   Lawyers for Messrs. Worthy and Fink couldn't be reachedfor comment. Mr. Parker's lawyer said only that &quot;we are verydisappointed that the government has brought these charges.&quot;   Parker Automotive, which makes a line of fuel-systemflushing products, earlier this month sold a controllinginterest in the company to closely held Remington Cos. ofDallas.   ---   HOUSING FOR HOMELESS is mandated in New York City.   A state court ruled that the city is required to providepermanent housing and support services for homeless peoplewho have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals.   The city was instructed by the court to devise a plan thatwould house the estimated 10,000 mentally ill people who liveon its streets. Providing such housing could cost hundreds ofmillions of dollars a year -- a tough burden for an alreadyfinancially strapped city.   City officials said they plan to appeal. But if the rulingstands, it would be the first time any municipality, orstate, has provided court-ordered housing and support-servicecare for the homeless, according to Robert M. Hayes, founderof the Coalition for the Homeless and currently of counsel toO'Melveny andamp; Myers. He said 15 states have statutoryprovisions requiring such care, but so far, none have beenimplemented.   As a result of an earlier lawsuit brought by theCoalition, all homeless people in New York City are alreadyentitled to shelter -- but not permanent housing -- providedby the city.   &quot;The city has always denied all responsibilty for thementally ill homeless,&quot; said Alisa D. Shudofsky, of Paul,Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrisson, who argued the case onbehalf of three homeless people. &quot;Judge {Edward H.} Lehner'sdecision means the city must finally live up to itsobligations.&quot;   City officials took issue with the judge's ruling, sayingthe obligation to house the homeless should be a stateobligation, since the state has broader taxing powers. &quot;Thecity is clearly unable to provide housing, given itsresources,&quot; said New York City Corporation counsel VictorKovner. &quot;By statute, it is a state obligation.&quot;   The roots of the issue go back to the 1970s when thousandsof mentally ill patients became homeless when they weredischarged from New York state hospitals. The state is nolonger releasing such patients, the judge said.   ---   CHILD-PORNOGRAPHY law won't be enforced yet, JusticeDepartment agrees.   The law -- which was scheduled to take effect yesterdayand was originally intended to discourage dissemination ofchild pornography -- requires videotape, record and printpublishers to maintain records of the names and ages ofmodels or actors used to depict sexually explicit conduct.   The law also requires distributors, sellers and librariesto place labels on the materials stating where such agerecords are kept. Those who fail to maintain the records orthe labels face fines and a maximum of two years in prison.   The law was challenged by a coalition of plaintiffs --including publishers, artists' groups, photographers and theAmerican Library Association -- as an unconstitutionalinfringement on free speech. On Monday, David Ogden, a lawyerfor the plaintiffs, argued in federal court in Washington,D.C., that it would be unconstitutional to begin enforcingthe law without first issuing regulations detailing howpeople should comply.   Late Tuesday, the Justice Department signed an agreementnot to enforce the law against the plaintiffs &quot;or anyone intheir chain of supply or distribution.&quot; The agreement did notstate when the department intends to submit the regulations.   ---   LAW-FIRM MARKETING is on the rise despite recession -- orbecause of it.   A survey of 121 law firms shows that 54% placedadvertisements in newspapers or other publications in 1990 --a 16 percentage-point increase over the year before. Thesenumbers do not include tombstone announcements, which manyfirms place in trade publications.   According to the survey, conducted by Of Counsel, a tradepublication, 84% of the respondents now have a budget formarketing, a 13 percentage-point increase over the previousyear's figure.   ---   AVOIDING LITIGATION: The American Arbitration Associationreported that it received 60,808 arbitration and mediationfilings in 1990, a 10% increase from the previous year. Thenonprofit organization said the value of the stated claimsand counterclaims was about $2.5 billion. Commercial, laborand no-fault insurance disputes showed the biggest increases,according to the AAA. In explaining the increase, AAAPresident Robert Coulson said, &quot;The business community issick and tired of the high cost of litigation and delays. . .. Lawyers are coming to realize that if they are going tokeep their clients, they are going to have to use more modernand efficient methods.&quot;   ---   LAWYERS FOR REFUGEES win $1.7 million in fees.   After a 10-year legal battle, lawyers who successfullychallenged the Immigration and Naturalization Service'shandling of Haitian refugees will get paid under the EqualAccess to Justice Act. Under that federal law, lawyers whohelp plaintiffs in cases in which the government has engagedin unjustified conduct are entitled to compensation from thegovernment.   The U.S. Department of Justice had challenged the paymentbut early this week agreed to it. The award was made toFried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, a New York-basedlaw firm; the Haitian Refugee Center of Miami; and Miamiattorneys Ira J. Kurzban, Irwin Stotsky, Bruce Winick andMichael Rosen.   ---   ARKANSAS LAWYER pleads innocent to thrift-fraud charges.E.
