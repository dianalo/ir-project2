Hackett Jr., a marketing manager for lightwave components at American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Solid State Technology Center in Breinigsville, Pa. &quot;This is a major step toward making (fiber-optic transceivers) a commodity,&quot; as opposed to low-volume, highly specialized gear, he said.    The three companies -- New York-based ATandamp;T, Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif. and Siemens AG of West Germany -- agreed on standard electrical and optical specifications for transceivers, as well as common package dimensions and plugs. The design covered in the agreement complies with the Fiber Distributed Data Interface standards under development by the American National Standards Institute. </TEXT></DOC>
