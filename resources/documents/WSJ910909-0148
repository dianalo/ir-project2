Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/09/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><MS>FINANCIAL (FIN)</MS><IN>ALL BANKS, BANKING NEWS AND ISSUES (BNK)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)TEXAS (TX)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- A House Banking Committee report blamed theComptroller of the Currency for &quot;supervisory failures&quot; thatcontributed to bank collapses and have led to adisproportionately large drain on the deposit insurance fund.   The panel compared the regulatory records -- as measuredby bank failures between Jan. 1, 1986, and June 30, 1991 --of three federal banking regulators and found that theperformance of the comptroller and the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. was significantly worse than that of theFederal Reserve Board.</LP><TEXT>   Banks regulated by the comptroller, which supervises aboutone-third of the nation's banks, accounted for 73% of the netlosses to the deposit insurance fund over the 5 1/2-yearperiod, the report concluded. Banks regulated by the FDICproduced the remaining losses, while by the committee'saccounting methods, the cost of failures of banks regulatedby the Fed was less than the deposit insurance premiums fromall Fed-regulated banks.   The report adds to the difficulties Comptroller RobertClarke faces in his effort to win confirmation to a secondfive-year term as the nation's chief supervisor of 3,900nationally chartered banks. President Bush nominated Mr.Clarke in December, but the Senate Banking Committee delayedhis confirmation hearings until Sept. 26 while it studied thecircumstances that led to the January failure of the Bank ofNew England, which will cost the Bank Insurance Fund about$2.3 billion.   Both the House and the Senate Banking Committees arepreparing reports on the Bank of New England that highlightregulatory lapses by the comptroller's office.   But the panel's comparison will help William Taylor, theFed's chief of bank supervision who has been nominated tobecome chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. whenWilliam Seidman leaves next month. While Congress has lookedmost recently at Mr. Taylor's role in efforts to supervisethe scandal-tinged Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International,the report refocuses attention on the Fed's comparativelysuperior record as a domestic bank regulator.   &quot;FDIC and OCC supervised banks are less effectivelysupervised than FRB supervised banks,&quot; the report concludes.   The report goes on to focus on the comptroller'sregulation of smaller banks-those with assets of less that $1billion. Since 1985, failures of smaller banks have accountedfor 75% of the $12.4 billion in net losses suffered by theFDIC's Bank Insurance Fund, and 53% of those losses came fromnationally chartered banks.   Officials at the FDIC and the comptroller's officewouldn't comment on the report, saying that they hadn't hadtime to study it.   To some degree, the comptroller's record reflects the waveof Texas bank failures following the oil price collapse inthe 1980s. More than half of the 1,009 banks that failedduring the 5 1/2 years covered by the study were in Texas,and many were nationally chartered.   But the panel also tied the high cost of small bankfailures to a 1986 policy approved by Mr. Clarke thatde-emphasized the importance of annual on-site examinationsfor small banks.   &quot;Comptroller Clarke's policy of emphasizing limitedexaminations targeted at specific problem areas, rather thanfull-scope examinations, is brought into serious question bythe findings of the report,&quot; House Banking Chairman HenryGonzalez (D., Texas) said. &quot;The other two bank regulatorstogether accounted for only slightly more than 25% of theinsurance losses, and it's significant that both agenciesrelied on full-scope examinations in a majority of cases.&quot;   According to the panel's figures, the Fed, which regulatesabout 1,000 state-chartered banks that are members of theFederal Reserve System, performed annual on-site exams at 97%of its banks over the period. The FDIC, which regulates about7,500 state-chartered banks that aren't in the Fed system,performed annual exams at 64% of its banks. By contrast, 36%of national banks received full on-site annual exams, withthe figure falling to 21% for banks with under $1 billion inassets. Banking bills approved by both the House and SenateBanking Committees would require annual on-site exams for allbanks.</TEXT></DOC>
