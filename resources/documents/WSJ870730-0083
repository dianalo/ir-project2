Vita Jr., senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Farm Fresh Inc., was named chief executive officer, effective immediately.    Mr. Vita, 54 years old, succeeds Eugene Walters, 64, who resigned last month before undergoing surgery. Mr. Walters remains president of Farm Fresh, a supermarket and convenience store chain.    The choice of Mr. Vita as the company's new chief executive is a result, in part, of &quot;his ability to bring people together. He's a good people person,&quot; said Larry W. Dobrinsky, vice president and treasurer of Farm Fresh. Although Farm Fresh acquired Open Air Markets Inc., another supermarket and convenience store chain a year ago, &quot;we're still not merged,&quot; said Mr. Dobrinsky. Mr. Vita was president and chief executive of Open Air markets before the merger, he said.    Separately, the company said it had hired Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. to advise it in the event of future takeover inquiries. As previously reported, Farm Fresh last week received an inquiry about its willingness to consider a leveraged buy-out proposal from a New York investment banking concern that wasn't identified. At the time, Farm Fresh said it wouldn't refuse to review a proposal but wasn't soliciting any.    Yesterday, Mr. Dobrinsky said that inquiry &quot;is dead,&quot; adding, &quot;as far as we're concerned the company is not for sale.&quot; Although the company hadn't received any other inquiries, it hired Kidder Peabody, he said, &quot;so that if something does happen, to be sure we handle it properly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
