Goldwin</HL><DATE>12/12/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15</SO><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Congress has been dismayingly inconsistent in its votingon gun-control legislation this year, first passing the BradyBill, then moving in the opposite direction by defeating aprovision to ban certain assault weapons and ammunition. Butin one respect members of Congress are consistent: theydemand respect for our &quot;constitutional right to own a gun.&quot;They cite the Constitution's Second Amendment and argue itprohibits effective national regulation of the privateownership of guns.   But there are strong grounds for arguing that the SecondAmendment is no barrier to gun-control legislation. In myopinion, it even provides a solid constitutional basis foreffective national legislation to regulate guns and gunowners.</LP><TEXT>   The best clues to the meaning of the key words and phrasesare in debates in the First Congress of the United States.The Members of that Congress were the authors of the SecondAmendment. A constitutional amendment calling for theprohibition of standing armies in time of peace was proposedby six state ratifying conventions. Virginia's version, latercopied by New York and North Carolina, brought together threeelements in one article -- affirmation of a right to beararms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standingarmy:   &quot;That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; thata well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the peopletrained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense ofa free state; that standing armies, in times of peace, aredangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided. . ..&quot;   The purpose was to limit the power of the new Congress toestablish a standing army, and instead to rely on statemilitias under command of governors. The Constitution wasratified without adopting any of the scores of proposedamendments. But in several states ratification came only withsolemn pledges that amendments would follow.   Soon after the First Congress met, James Madison, electedas a congressman from Virginia on the basis of such a pledge,proposed a number of amendments resembling yet different fromarticles proposed by states. These eventually became the Billof Rights. In the version of the arms amendment he presented,Madison dropped mention of a standing army and added aconscientious objector clause.   &quot;The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall notbe infringed, a well armed and well regulated militia beingthe best security of a free country, but no personreligiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled torender military service in person.&quot;   In this version, &quot;bearing arms&quot; must mean &quot;to rendermilitary service,&quot; or why else would there have to be anexemption for religious reasons? What right must not beinfringed? The right of the people to serve in the militia.   This militia amendment was referred to a congressionalcommittee, and came out of committee in this form:   &quot;A well regulated militia, composed of the body of thepeople, being the best security of a free state, the right ofthe people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; butno person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to beararms.&quot;   Two significant changes had been made: first, the phrase&quot;to render military service in person&quot; was replaced by thephrase &quot;to bear arms,&quot; again indicating that they are twoways to say the same thing; second, an explanation was added,that the &quot;militia&quot; is &quot;composed of the body of the people.&quot;   The House then debated this new version in committee ofthe whole and, surprisingly, considering the subsequenthistory of the provision, never once did any member mentionthe private uses of arms, for self-protection, or hunting, orany other personal purpose. The debate focused exclusively onthe conscientious objector provision. Eventually thecommittee's version was narrowly approved. The Senate in turngave it its final form, briefer, unfortunately moreelliptical, and with the exemption for conscientiousobjectors deleted:   &quot;A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the securityof a free state, the right of the people to keep and beararms, shall not be infringed.&quot;   Certain explanations were lost or buried in thislegislative process: that the right to bear arms meant theright to serve in the militia; that just about everybody wasincluded in the militia; and that the amendment as a wholesought to minimize if not eliminate reliance on a standingarmy by emphasizing the role of the state militia, whichwould require that everyone be ready to be called to serve.   But what about the private right &quot;to keep and bear arms,&quot;to own a gun for self-defense and hunting? Isn't that clearlyprotected by the amendment? Didn't just about everyone own agun in 1791? Wouldn't that right go without saying? Yes, ofcourse, it would go without saying, especially then whenthere were no organized police forces and when hunting wasessential to the food supply.   But such facts tell us almost nothing relevant to ourquestion. Almost everyone also owned a dog for the samepurposes. The Constitution nevertheless says nothing aboutthe undeniable right to own a dog. There are uncountablenumbers of rights not enumerated in the Constitution. Theserights are neither denied nor disparaged by not being raisedto the explicit constitutional level. All of them areconstitutionally subject to regulation.   The right to bear arms protected in the Second Amendmenthas to do directly with &quot;a well-regulated militia.&quot; Moreevidence of the connection can be found in the Militia Act of1792.   &quot;Every free able-bodied white male citizen&quot; (it was 1792,after all) was required by the act to &quot;enroll&quot; in the militiafor training and active service in case of need. Whenreporting for service, every militiaman was required toprovide a prescribed rifle or musket, and ammunition.   Here we see the link of the private and public aspects ofbearing arms. The expectation was that every man would havehis own firearms. But the aspect that was raised to the levelof constitutional concern was the public interest in thosearms.   What does this mean for the question of gun control today?Well, for example, it means that Congress has theconstitutional power to enact a Militia Act of 1992, torequire every person who owns a gun or aspires to own one to&quot;enroll&quot; in the militia. In plain 1990s English, if you wantto own a gun, sign up with the National Guard.   Requiring every gun owner to register with the NationalGuard (as we require 18-year-olds to register with theSelective Service) would provide the information about gunowners sought by the Brady and Staggers bills, and much more.Standards could be set for purchase or ownership of guns, andpenalties could be established.   Restoring a 200-year-old understanding of the Constitutionmay be difficult, but there isn't time to dawdle. Americansnow own more than 200 million guns, and opinion polls showAmericans want gun control. Why not avail ourselves of theSecond Amendment remedy? Call in the militia, which is, afterall, &quot;composed of the body of the people.&quot;   ---   Mr. Goldwin is a resident scholar in constitutionalstudies at the American Enterprise Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
