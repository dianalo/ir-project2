Pesch, a Chicago physician.    The latest proposal from Alpha Health Systems Corp., a unit of Pesch andamp; Co., totaled $22 a share. The bid for American Medical's 86.9 million shares outstanding consisted of $17 cash, preferred stock with an intended market value of $4, and common stock with an intended value of $1 a share.    Pesch, based in Lake Forest, Ill., is a closely held health care, information systems and real estate development concern.    The bid, which replaced a $20-a-share proposal rebuffed last month by American Medical, had been set to expire yesterday.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Medical closed at $19.125, down 37.5 cents.    In a letter to Dr. Pesch, American Medical directors said they had &quot;concluded unanimously&quot; that the proposal wasn't in the best interests of the company or its holders &quot;and, accordingly, shouldn't be pursued.&quot; The letter said the proposal &quot;appears, in substance, to be nothing more than a plan for the recapitalization&quot; of American Medical that the company &quot;could effect by itself if our board deemed it desirable for our shareholders.&quot;    American Medical, which has 159 health care facilities in the U.S. and abroad making it the nation's fourth-largest hospital operator, said its own business restructuring is expected to &quot;produce substantial earnings and cash flow gains, which should greatly benefit our shareholders.&quot;    The company, which wasn't more specific about its earnings outlook, posted a $97.3 million loss on $3.46 billion in revenue for the year ended last Aug. 31. It also embarked on a cost-cutting program and restructuring that involved plans to establish a real estate investment trust to own and lease back to the company seven acute-care hospitals.    A few weeks before the first bid from Dr. Pesch, American Medical reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $28.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $28.7 million in the 1985 quarter. Per-share earnings in the 1985 quarter were also 33 cents a share. Revenue in the latest period rose 16% to $931 million. American Health Properties Inc., the trust in which American Medical holds about a 9.8% stake, sold 10 million common shares at $20 each last month.    In a statement, Dr. Pesch said late yesterday that while he had received &quot;no direct communication from the (American Medical) board of directors, I am aware of the statement distributed to the media by (American Medical) indicating they have rejected my latest offer.&quot;    He added that he and associates &quot;are exploring all available options, and I will withhold further comment until we have chosen our course of action.&quot;    Dr. Pesch last year led a $406.2 million leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp., a Dallas health care concern, and had said he planned to pursue an expansion of his company's hospital system.    Analysts have questioned his ability to arrange financing for such a large-scale acquisition as American Medical. Dr. Pesch, who said several weeks ago that he owns about one million American Medical shares, claims to have contacted several major shareholders about his bid. Earlier this month, Wedge Group Inc., a Houston investment firm with a 5.5% stake in American Medical, disclosed that it was talking with Dr. Pesch about possibly selling its stock or joining with others to seek control of the company. But Wedge said at the time that it hadn't reached any agreements or understandings with Pesch. </TEXT></DOC>
