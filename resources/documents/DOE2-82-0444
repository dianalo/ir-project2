The Toplink system from Integrated PhotonicsInc., Carlsbad, Calif., is also compatible with emerging standards forhigh-speed links in development at Los Alamos National Laboratories.The Toplink system may be the first wave of fiber-optic alternativesfor supercomputer environments. Toplink consists of one to six two-fiberdata links, each of which runs at 405 Mbits/s. Six links working togetherhave already been tested at 2.43 Gbits/s. The links use standard opticalfiber, either single-fiber or multistrand cables.</TEXT></DOC>
