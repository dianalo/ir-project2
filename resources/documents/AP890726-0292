Gasoline prices began deteriorating last week after an AmericanPetroleum Institute report that showed inventories were building,reflecting a softening in demand, according to analysts.   Although this week's lower API statistics were perceived by manytraders as bullish for the market, selling of gasoline futuresremained strong.   ``The market didn't like gasoline even with with lower stocks,''said Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.``Even though they were down they were still well above a year ago,although last year they were at an all-time low. The perception inthe market is that they still might be too high.''   Gasoline supplies fell by 1.5 million barrels to 221.3 millionbarrels in the week ending July 21, according to the API report.Inventories remained 13.4 million barrels ahead of last year,however.   The API report also showed crude oil stocks fell 1.4 millionbarrels to 330.5 million in the week and were down by 19.2 millionbarrels over last year.   Heating oil inventories were down by 800,000 barrels to 109.4million for the week and by 7.8 million from last year.   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc., said falling gasoline prices continuedto put pressure on the crude market. The API report, he said, wasconsidered neutral for the market.   In addition, he said, reports that some members of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are still producingabove expectations, are keeping crude prices soft.</TEXT></DOC>
