Under a new policy revealed as Mrs. Bush arrived here for thefuneral of Emperor Hirohito, the first lady no longer will talkabout controversial issues such as gun control and abortion.   ``They are not the issues where she wishes to have a focus,''said Anna Perez, her press secretary.   ``It doesn't mean she doesn't have a right to an opinion. Itmeans she has a right to discuss them or not,'' Ms. Perez said.   Mrs. Bush and her husband appeared at odds after she said in arecent interview with The Associated Press that she ``absolutely''favors a ban on military-style assault weapons, such as the one usedin the recent schoolyard massacre in Stockton, Calif., where fivechildren were killed and more than two dozen were wounded.   Questioned separately, the president said he does not favor a banon semiautomatic weapons because they are used by sportsmen andhunters. It was a semiautomatic AK-47 that was used in the Stocktonincident.   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, thenation's largest gun lobby, said police should do more to enforcethe laws.   Ms. Perez quoted the first lady as saying ``there isn't that muchof a difference of opinion'' between Bush and his wife over theissue of assault-style weapons.   ``If there is, they will discuss it among themselves,'' Ms. Perezadded.   The press secretary said Mrs. Bush wants to highlight issues suchas the homeless, the deadly disease AIDS and illiteracy instead ofcontroversial matters.   Emphasizing that Mrs. Bush does not want to take the limelightfrom her husband on important subjects, Ms. Perez said, ``She's notthe one that makes policy. She doesn't lobby Congress. She's not thepresident.''   Ms. Perez added, ``The opinions that are important, that requirethe spotlight, are those of her husband.''   Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush had tea with Naoko Takeshita, wife ofJapanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and expressed sympathy overthe death of Hirohito, who died of cancer at the age of 87.   In turn, Mrs. Takeshita offered her congratulations on Bush'selection as president.   The two women met at the official residence of the Takeshitas,although the family actually lives in a private home in Tokyo. Theytalked in a small, green-carpeted room decorated with flowers and apastel painting of Mount Fuji.   For the occasion, Mrs. Bush wore an elegant black suit and hertrademark strand of imitation pearls. Mrs. Takeshita wore a navyblue suit.</TEXT></DOC>
