Nader said Congress ``should ban Alar by name, unilaterally andimmediately.''   He told the Senate subcommittee on toxic substances that thereis now ``a convergence'' of interest between consumers who don'twant Alar on apples and apple growers hurt by plummeting applesales.   Nader maintained the only opposition to an immediate ban comesfrom suppliers of Alar, or daminozide.   The chemical is used to regulate growth and extend shelf life ofapples.   Stopping just short of saying he will introduce such a measure,Sen. John Warner, R-Va., noted that Congress can act much morequickly on such matters than the Environmental Protection Agency,which announced over the weekend that it has started a procedurethat could lead to an Alar ban in about 18 months.   ``What Congress can do one day, it can undo the next,'' saidWarner. ``We could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banningAlar and put that behind us.''   Apples are a major agricultural product in Warner's state and henoted that sales have been hurt severely by consumer reaction to aseries of news reports focusing on assertions that Alar poses aserious cancer risk, particularly to children.   ``It would bring back a measure of confidence in the consumer,particularly the housewife struggling with children,'' Warner saidof legislation. ``I think we need some swift, decisive action torestore confidence in the marketplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
