Coal is the preferred fuel for power generation and suppliesare plentiful. However, environmental problems, in particular acid rainand the 'greenhouse effect', must be addressed. The 'regulated pollutants'SO{sub 2}, NO{sub 2} and particulates can be effectively controlled butthe unregulated pollutants N{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} need a technologicalbreakthrough if the 'greenhouse effect' is to be limited. Changes inatmospheric chemistry with increased energy demand and industrial activityare described. The contribution of fossil fuel burning to atmosphericconcentrations of CO{sub 2} and methane was debated, as was the natureof the threat from the 'greenhouse effect'. Papers were also presentedon more efficient use of energy and pollution counter measures. 1 ref.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
