ZweigStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CMBBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chase Manhattan Bank may close as many as 50 New York-area branches as part of a contemplated restructuring of its retail banking network, industry sources said.    Chase, which currently has more than 230 such offices, confirmed that it is considering closing some as part of a worldwide restructuring and cost-reduction effort it disclosed in releasing third-quarter earnings. But a spokesman said it was &quot;premature&quot; to predict how many.    A move to close the branches would be aimed at bolstering the sagging profitability of Chase's branch system, which has been hurt in recent years because revenue growth has failed to keep pace with increased operating expenses.    Industry sources indicated that a study, expected to be completed in about two months, probably would recommend that certain branches be consolidated or replaced by more cost-efficient limited-service offices or automated teller machines. The limited-service offices could specialize in serving small businesses or making large personal loans to affluent consumers.    A Chase spokesman added that the study, which he described as part of a reevaluation of Chase's &quot;brick and mortar presences&quot; throughout the world, also could lead to the opening of full-service branches in areas where they prove to be more cost-efficient.    &quot;The delivery systems that consumers prefer are different than what they used to be,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;The density of brick and mortar is no longer necessary. We've got too many branches that are too close together in some neighborhoods.&quot;    Chase said that as part of the global restructuring effort, the company expects to cut its total staff by 1,000 jobs, to 46,000, by the end of 1987. The cuts will be achieved through attrition, redeployments and layoffs, the spokesman said. About 3,000 jobs, some currently vacant, will be eliminated and 2,000 added, he said.    In the third quarter of 1986, Chase Manhattan Corp., the bank's parent, included in its operating expenses a $30 million one-time charge for cutbacks, including termination of leases, in its domestic and international network. </TEXT></DOC>
