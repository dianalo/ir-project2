The Waltham, Mass., maker of communications systems and computer equipment said it would cut the division's work force 20%, or about 100 employees, and concentrate its efforts on development and marketing of high performance superminicomputers. Development activities on its less profitable, lower performance 5/32 minicomputers will be reduced, but the division will continue to provide support to customers who have purchased the machines, the company said.    The division, which also makes office automation software, has annual sales of about $60 million, but is expected to post losses of $12 million to $13 million this year. Cost cutting from the restructuring should enable the division to &quot;approach&quot; break-even in 1988, the company said.    Computer Consoles said its earlier projection of 1987 pretax profit of about $8 million is &quot;no longer attainable,&quot; John F. Cunningham, chairman and chief executive officer, said. He said the company should earn about $500,000, or two cents to four cents a share, in the third quarter and slightly more in the fourth quarter.    For the 1986 third quarter, the company earned $1.6 million, or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $34 million. For all of 1986, the company had a loss of $3 million on revenue of $129.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
