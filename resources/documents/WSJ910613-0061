On Feb. 22, the VOA's Arabic Language Service, as part ofits coverage of the conflict, broadcast live the Iraqi HighCommand's communique No. 58. It falsely hailed the success ofIraqi forces, accused the U.S. of unwarranted aggression andblamed the Bush administration for undermining peace effortsto end the Gulf War. Within the hour, VOA carried anotherofficial Iraqi communique to the Arab world that erroneouslyclaimed that the U.S.-led coalition was suffering heavybattlefield losses.</LP><TEXT>   Throughout the Gulf War, which was widely supported in theU.S., the Arabic Language Service showed a surprisinganti-American tilt. During the week of Jan. 20, according toone sampling, 15 of 20 Americans and Arabs interviewed by VOAcorrespondents criticized either the Bush administration'spolicy or its coalition partners. And VOA Arab-languagebroadcasters read excerpts from 18 U.S. newspaper articlesthat week -- 10 of which presented negative views of the U.S.and its allies.   Last week, President Bush praised the VOA, saying it&quot;helped us get the word out, helped people in the Middle Eastand around the world separate fact from fiction about Iraq'saggression and the intentions of Saddam Hussein.&quot; But criticssay the VOA Arabic service often got the wrong word out.   &quot;They not only did a miserable job of accuratelyreflecting the U.S. public support for the war, but theyfocused on interviews and emphasized those few spokesmen whowere critical of the war,&quot; says Rep. Howard Berman, aCalifornia Democrat whose House Foreign Affairs subcommitteehas jurisdiction over VOA and its parent, the U.S.Information Agency.   &quot;The mission of VOA is to tell America's story toforeigners,&quot; adds Joseph Morris, who was general counsel andchief of staff of the USIA during the Reagan administration.&quot;They're supposed to do public diplomacy, not journalism.That means they're supposed to convey the viewpoint of theU.S. government and help the American diplomatic effort.&quot;   Senior VOA officials reject such criticism, asserting thatwhile broadcasters may have occasionally made bad editorialdecisions, the overall coverage was fair and balanced. &quot;Byand large, the 46 people in the Arabic branch did a sterlingjob under adverse conditions,&quot; says Robert Coonrod, VOA'sdeputy director.   As a result of the furor over its wartime performance, VOAhas commissioned two private studies of its Arabic LanguageService; its inspector general is conducting a probe; and Mr.Berman's panel plans to take a broad look next month atwhether VOA and other taxpayer-supported information servicesare fulfilling their missions.   Although many VOA broadcasters think of themselves asjournalists working for a kind of world-wide National PublicRadio, their charter makes clear that, unlike private-sectorreporters, they are an arm of U.S. diplomacy. In addition toproviding news, VOA must offer &quot;a balanced and comprehensiveprojection of significant American thought and institutions,&quot;and &quot;present the policies of the United States clearly andeffectively.&quot;   Mr. Coonrod argues it was necessary to carry the Iraqibroadcasts and information in order to not appear one-sidedin its coverage -- something that would have cost it bothcredibility and audience in the Arab world. &quot;We're trying toprovide the kind of perspective on world events that gainsthe respect of our audience,&quot; he says. &quot;You gain the respectof your listeners by being accurate and credible.&quot;   But Mr. Morris and other critics say some VOA reporters,in an effort to achieve journalistic independence, reach toofar to achieve &quot;balance&quot; in their broadcasts. Other critics,noting that VOA expanded its Arabic broadcasts to 15 1/2hours daily from seven hours after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,say the agency filled too much of the additional time withcritical views.   Mr. Coonrod says, &quot;I'm satisfied that the editorialcontrols we had in place were adequate and held up during aperiod when we doubled our broadcasting.&quot;   Many of America's Arab allies during the Gulf War weren'tsatisfied, however. In a classified cable to the StateDepartment, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt relayed protestsfrom President Hosni Mubarak about a VOA interview with anEgyptian archeology professor, whose critical views on theGulf War he said were &quot;irrelevant.&quot; Saudi officialscomplained to Washington that VOA had become &quot;the Voice ofBaghdad,&quot; according to a former U.S. official.   As a result of the complaints, the VOA in Februarycommissioned two private studies of its Arabic operations, bythe Center for Strategic and International Studies and theHudson Institute, at a total cost of $92,000. Initially,VOA's plan was to have the reviewers analyze the service'sbroadcasts on some specific day in the future. Undercongressional pressure, though, the studies were expanded toinclude past coverage of the war.   The studies essentially gave VOA passing grades. Indeed,most of VOA's regular news reports were straightforward. Buta careful reading of the 142-page appendix of the CSIS studytells a different story about selected VOA interviews andfeatures.   For instance, on Jan. 24, VOA broadcast a programhighlighting pro-Saddam sentiment in Algeria and what itcalled growing fragmentation in the Arab world. The reportersaid: &quot;A number of Arab capitals witnessed demonstrations insupport of the Iraqi president, especially when he aimed hismissile attacks at Israel.&quot; To the surprise of many U.S.experts, the demonstrations in Arab capitals weren'twidespread.   On Jan. 20, VOA reported growing anti-war sentiment inEurope. The CSIS analysis adds that &quot;the story, as reported,gives the impression that feelings all over Europe areagainst war.&quot; The analysis notes that the VOA Arabicbroadcast omitted a line from the English-language scriptstating that a new poll in Germany showed 81.4% support formilitary action.   During the week of Jan. 21, the VOA also broadcast atleast three reports from Mauritania, a rabidly anti-coalitionArab nation in Africa that had virtually no involvement inthe conflict. One report described &quot;angry citizens&quot; carryingpictures of Saddam Hussein; another featured Mauritania'sinformation minister accusing the coalition of exceeding itsdeclared goal of liberating Kuwait.   The Arabic broadcast neglected to translate a line fromthe English text describing Mauritania as &quot;Iraq's onlysupporter in West Africa.&quot;   Mistrust of VOA among America's Arab allies was so intensethat after the VOA installed a 50-kilowatt transmitter inBahrain capable of reaching Kuwait and southern Iraq, theBahraini government in January refused to allow VOA tobroadcast its Arabic service from the facility. In a letterto Bruce Gelb, who then was director of USIA, Bahrain'sminister of information complained that &quot;I think it is easyto send the wrong message when you communicate with othercultures through different languages.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
