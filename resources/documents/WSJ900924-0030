For instance, Scholastic Corp., the well-known publisherof children's books, is planning to go public this week atabout $19.50 a share, more than 14 times the originalinvestment of some selling shareholders.</LP><TEXT>   A few of the LBO investors in NRM Steelastic will makenearly 123 times their investment of about 11 cents a shareif the maker of equipment for tire manufacturers goes publicagain at $13.50 a share, as planned. Last week, CiticorpVenture Capital Ltd., a unit of Citicorp, cashed in its 1986investment in Pamida Holdings, at 25 times its originalinvestment of 20 cents a share.   Not that the selling shareholders are getting everythingthey want: The Citicorp group had envisioned getting 75 timesits original investment in Pamida, a Midwestern discountretail chain. The NRM Steelastic offering has been delayed;20% of the company's revenue is tied up in Iraq. The newissues market has been battered by weakness in the economyand the stock market, leaving similar deals -- such as one byMusicland -- stranded as they wait to go public.   &quot;In a bear market, there are limits to what you can askpeople to {pay} without offending their sensibilities,&quot; saysRoger McNamee, co-manager of T. Rowe Price Associates' NewHorizons Fund. For LBO investors cashing out, &quot;we're talkingabout the difference between spectacular and ridiculoussuccess.&quot;   Scholastic will offer a test of how high a price a companythat is favorably viewed can command from shell-shockedinvestors. Founded in 1920 by Maurice R. Robinson, this NewYork publisher of children's books and other educationalmaterials has a franchise and international distributionnetwork widely praised by analysts.   In 1987, after trading publicly for 18 years, Scholasticwas taken private in a leveraged buy-out by Richard Robinson,chairman, chief executive and a son of the founder, and otherRobinson family members and company executives.   The buy-out is generally considered a success. Revenue inthe 1990 fiscal year ended May 31 was $374.6 million, morethan double the $180.3 million in fiscal 1986. Scholasticturned an operating loss of $6.7 million in fiscal 1989 intooperating income of $24.2 million in fiscal 1990.   The company now plans to raise between $75.6 million and$88.2 million by offering 4.2 million common shares to thepublic at between $18 and $21 apiece; of that, 3.27 millionshares will be sold by the company and the rest byshareholders who originally paid about $1.35 a share.Proceeds will be used to help repay more than $46 million indebt. After the offering, current shareholders will control67.3% of the company, with 32.7% held by the public. Thestock will trade over the counter.   Scholastic &quot;has done an excellent job of increasingprofitability,&quot; says Robert Natale, new-issues analyst forStandard andamp; Poor's Corp. But when he compares the proposedstock price to those of comparable companies, he concludesthe offering is overpriced. &quot;Investors would do well to buyit at $14.50 a share or less,&quot; he advises.   Mr. Natale isn't alone in balking at the planned offering.Mr. McNamee of T. Rowe Price points out that Mr. Robinson andother executives were granted options in May to buy stock at$9.64 a share, about half the planned price of the initialpublic offering. While other publishing stocks have taken abeating this year, &quot;it hardly seems fair that they get a 100%mark-up,&quot; he says.   &quot;They'll all be spectacularly wealthy,&quot; Mr. McNamee adds.&quot;It's just a question of playing chicken with the market andseeing how much they can get.&quot; As does Mr. Natale, he likesthe company's prospects and hopes that it will strike acompromise with willing investors.   For venture capitalists eager to cash in on theirinvestments, last week's offering of Pamida Holdings showswhat it takes to lure skeptical investors in today's fragilemarket. Pamida, publicly owned from 1969 to 1981, was boughtby an employee stock ownership plan in 1981. In 1986, a groupled by Citicorp Venture Capital bought the company in aleveraged buy-out.   Originally, Pamida filed in June with the Securities andExchange Commission for an offering of 2.8 million shares at$14 to $17 each; of that, the company planned to sell twomillion shares to raise funds. Later, the price was loweredto $13 to $16 a share, but the offering was increased to fourmillion shares.   Last week, Pamida finally went public on the AmericanStock Exchange at $5 a share, with only 1.5 million sharesoffered -- Citicorp Venture Capital's entire stake. Atone-third the hoped-for price of $15 a share, the discountseemed steep enough to satisfy investors: Pamida closedFriday at $6.375. And Citicorp Venture Capital cashed out at25 times its original 20 cent-a-share investment.   On the other hand, some other &quot;reverse LBOs&quot; on the publicequity agenda are drawing cautious reviews from analysts andmoney managers. Reverse LBOs refer to companies taken privatein a leveraged buy-out that, theoretically, have matured andare now going public to seek debt relief or allow theirinvestors to cash profits.   Steelastic, an Ohio maker of tire-manufacturing equipment,was bought in a 1986 LBO by a group of investors led by JohnD. Vazzana. In 1987, Steelastic bought Goodyear'stire-retreading equipment business; this year it bought NRMCorp., a maker of tire building machines and other equipment.Pro forma net income jumped to $8.2 million on sales of$117.8 million in fiscal 1990 ended March 31, from income of$1.1 million in fiscal 1986 on sales of $8.3 million. Whilethe acquisition of NRM Corp. contributed to a big jump insales, it also added to the company's debt load.   To pare $48 million in long-term debt down to about $20million, or about 25% of total capitalization after theoffering, NRM Steelastic plans an initial offering of 3.35million shares at $12 to $15 each. The company plans to sell2.8 million of those shares. Certain shareholders whooriginally bought stock for 11 cents a share will sell therest.   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has put the offering on hold.Company officials were out of the country and not availableto comment on what the invasion has done to NRM Steelastic'soperations in Iraq, which accounted for 20% of pro-forma netsales in fiscal 1990.   Even without its problems in the Mideast, NRM Steelasticis vulnerable to a slowing economy. &quot;The tire business is notthe kind of company you want to own in a recession,&quot; saysSandamp;P's Mr. Natale.</TEXT></DOC>
