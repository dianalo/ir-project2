Anzer's stability criteriaare used for the vertical plane prominences. An example of stable equilibriummeeting these criteria is given. The stability of curved prominence sheetsis investigated, showing that the static models reported in the earlierwork of Wu and Low are all unstable. In spherical geometry, the sufficientstability criteria are derived for plane disk-shaped current sheets andapplied to a simple model of Low for a nonrotating equatorial accretiondisk. The importance of the magnetic tension force in stabilizing anequilibrium system is discussed. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
