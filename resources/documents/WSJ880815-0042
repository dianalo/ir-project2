Boesky's arbitrage firm beginning in 1984, and they tripled their money in two years from Mr. Boesky's speculation in takeover stocks.    The financial tie between Mr. Boesky and Mr. Milken -- Drexel's high-yield bond chief and top dealmaker -- raises questions of potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Milken and Drexel, lawyers and Wall Street executives said. From 1984 to 1986, when the Drexel employee group held a stake in Mr. Boesky's operation, Mr. Boesky was Wall Street's most powerful takeover speculator and traded in many stocks about which Drexel had valuable inside information.    The existence of the financial links also casts new light on the close ties between Mr. Milken and the now-imprisoned Mr. Boesky, a relationship being scrutinized by government investigators. As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved -- but has agreed not to file immediately -- civil charges of securities-law violations against Drexel, Mr. Milken and three other Drexel employees. The charges are based largely on allegations of illegal dealings between Mr. Boesky and Drexel, according to people familiar with the investigation.    The previously unknown ties among Mr. Milken, a group of 26 other Drexel employees and Mr. Boesky are disclosed in public documents filed in Washington, D.C., and California; in private offering documents; and by people familiar with the relationship. People close to Drexel say the Drexel employees invested $1 million in the Boesky firm -- Seemala Corp. -- in 1984 and received $3 million for their stake in 1986.    The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a 1%, nonvoting stake in Seemala in 1984. Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public SEC filing that year; Seemala didn't identify the investors in Camro. But a separate 1984 filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr. Milken and 26 other Drexel employees.    A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, said, &quot;The investment was made over four years ago with the full knowledge and consent of&quot; Drexel. &quot;It was fully disclosed and the amount involved was only 1% of the equity {of Seemala} based on book value.&quot; He said the transaction was proposed by Fried Frank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson, &quot;a highly regarded law firm working at the time for Seemala, and the investment, which was strictly passive, was entered into because it made economic sense. We believe the investment was appropriate.&quot;    Harvey Pitt, Mr. Boesky's lawyer, declined to comment.    At the time of Camro's investment, Mr. Boesky and his family controlled Seemala through another family-owned company, Ivan F. Boesky Corp. People close to Drexel say Mr. Boesky in 1984 proposed to liquidate Seemala to cut his tax bill on trading profits. But they said that under prevailing tax law, he needed another investor to qualify for the desired tax treatment. Mr. Boesky later abandoned the plan to liquidate Seemala after Seemala sustained losses that eroded the profits.    The people close to Drexel said Camro was simply helping a Drexel client -- Mr. Boesky. However, other people close to the situation say the Camro stake fits a familiar pattern in which Mr. Milken and Drexel have repeatedly demanded, and obtained, equity stakes in companies of investment banking clients.    Camro was made up largely of employees of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., high-yield, &quot;junk-bond&quot; operations, the Camro public filing shows. Camro partners included some of Mr. Milken's top aides: his brother Lowell J. Milken, Peter Ackerman, Bruce Newberg and James Dahl. As previously reported, Mr. Newberg, who left Drexel earlier this year, was indicted Aug. 4 on charges of racketeering and mail and wire fraud in an alleged tax-fraud scheme involving Princeton/Newport Partners. Lowell Milken is one of the Drexel employees facing the SEC civil charges, according to people familiar with the charges.    The $1 million investment by Mr. Milken and his group was highly profitable. When Mr. Boesky sold his firm to a group of investors in 1986 in a $1 billion sale and recapitalization, Camro received $3 million from the sale proceeds, according to the people close to Drexel. They said Camro wasn't treated differently from other investors in Seemala.    In March 1987, a civil lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York by 42 limited partners of Seemala against Mr. Boesky, Drexel and others. The suit alleges that Mr. Boesky misled the limited partners in the sale of interests in a new investment partnership in 1986. Although the lawsuit also alleges that Camro received $27 million for its Seemala stake, people close to Drexel said that figure is wrong. The partners are seeking to recover their $338 million investment plus interest. Mr. Boesky's former arbitrage operation is in liquidation.    Wall Street executives said any financial ties between employees of an investment bank and an outside arbitrage firm would raise the possibility of serious conflicts of interest. Investment-banking firms have confidential information about takeover deals they are working on for clients -- information that would be very valuable to anyone trading in takeover stocks.    David Hershberg, a vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said, &quot;We have a blanket policy prohibiting any investment-banking employee from investing in deal-related securities, whether it's a fund or an individual stock that could be in play.&quot;    Allowing investment bankers to invest in an outside arbitrage firm &quot;would be very imprudent,&quot; said Richard Jenrette, chairman of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and its Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. securities unit. &quot;Even if there's no wrongdoing, it could lead to an appearance of wrongdoing,&quot; he said.    Major Wall Street investment banks operate their own arbitrage units, but they are required to maintain a so-called Chinese Wall between investment bankers and arbitragers. The firms also must bar trading by their arbitrage units in any stock about which the firm possesses confidential, market-sensitive information.    After the Drexel employee group sold its stake in Mr. Boesky's arbitrage firm in 1986, Drexel immediately took its own stake in Mr. Boesky's successor firm. Drexel sold $660 million in notes as part of Mr. Boesky's effort to raise $1 billion in debt and equity for his new firm, received $24 million in investment banking fees, and invested $5 million in the new firm.    Drexel's interest in Mr. Boesky's new firm, Seemala Partners, was held by two partnerships linked to Drexel: Fillmore Financial and Anchor Capital Holdings. The Drexel units received 6% of Seemala Partners' gross profits, the lawsuit says. The suit charges that this was &quot;a disproportionate percentage&quot; in relation to the $5 million contributed to Seemala Partners' capital. </TEXT></DOC>
