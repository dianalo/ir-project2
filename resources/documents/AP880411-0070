The threat was accompanied by photographs of two hostages,journalists Terry A. Anderson, an American, and Jean-Paul Kauffmannof France.   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, is the longest held of the 22 foreigners missing after beingkidnapped in Lebanon. He was abducted March 16, 1985, in westBeirut.   Kauffmann, 43, was kidnapped May 22, 1985.   The typed, Arabic-language statement was delivered Sunday to theReuters news agency in west Beirut.   It declared full support for the hijackers' demand in Cyprus forthe release of 17 convicted pro-Iranian terrorists, all but one ofthem Shiites, imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and Frenchembassies in December 1983. Kuwait has refused to free them.   The statement said the 17 were jailed for ``confronting thecenters of international arrogance in our Islamic homeland alongwith regimes that sold themselves cheaply to the superpowers andtheir interests in the region.''   Islamic Jihad claims to hold three Frenchmen and anotherAmerican, Thomas Sutherland, 55, of Fort Collins, Colo. He waskidnapped June 9, 1985.   Sutherland was acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut.   Islamic Jihad has said the two other Frenchmen its men kidnappedare Marcel Fontaine, 47, vice consul at the French Embassy,abducted March 22, 1985, and Marcel Carton, 64, the embassy'sprotocol officer, who was kidnapped in a separate attack the sameday.   Today, a spokesman for Hezbollah, or Party of God, said hisgroup was ``not involved in any way'' in the hijacking. Chiefspokesman Sheik Ibrahim el-Amin, speaking to reporters in westBeirut, declined to say if his group supports the hijackers' demandfor release of prisoners in Kuwait.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization for theShiite extremist factions holding many of the foreign hostages inLebanon. Hezbollah has never claimed responsibility for kidnappinga foreigner.   El-Amin also said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was``not kidnapped but detained.''   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was serving with a U.N.peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was kidnapped near Tyreon Feb. 17.   El-Amin denied his group had been involved in Higgins' capture,which has been claimed by the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth.</TEXT></DOC>
