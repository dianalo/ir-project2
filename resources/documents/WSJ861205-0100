Morrison</HL><DD> 12/05/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   American families aren't what they used to be. They've changed drastically, and that has taken many people -- including lawmakers -- by surprise.    Legislators who used to draft laws that assumed the traditional family was the norm now confront a drastically altered situation: couples divorce, single women bear children, old people live alone, and &quot;blended&quot; families bring together children of two marriages. It's tough to enforce family responsibility through laws embodying a traditional view of what the family should be like, but no longer is.    Take Wisconsin's recent law on &quot;grandparents' liability.&quot; The law makes parents financially responsible for infants born to their unmarried children under age 18 (enacted partly to give parents a larger stake in their children's sex education).    This would seem to be a simple, common-sense approach to the problem of teen-age childbearing. But potential complications arose when the first Wisconsin grandparents to be held liable for their teen-age daughter's baby turned out to be divorced. Perhaps some modern Solomon could resolve the central question. If a divorced mother has remarried, and years later her unmarried daughter makes her a grandmother, should Wisconsin impose the duty of support on the natural grandfather or the adoptive grandfather -- or both?    Similarly, some states require the children of Medicaid recipients to help pay for their parents' nursing-home care. The federal government may soon deny Medicaid benefits for long-term care if the recipients' children or spouses are able, but refuse, to defray some of the cost -- even at the expense of some other disabled family member.    Again, difficult questions arise: Consider a widow with minor children. She marries a man who develops a chronic and costly health condition. If he adopts her children, are they legally obligated to pay some of his medical expenses when they become adults?    It's not that the underlying social concerns are misplaced. Unmarried women, many of them teen-agers, bore 770,000 babies in 1984 -- fully a fifth of all U.S. births that year. Once, many teen-age mothers would have married. But today many shun marriage as the risky proposition it is. The men who fathered their children may seem poor prospects as providers.    But two-thirds of today's single mothers aren't teen-agers. Increasingly, they are mature, white, in their late 20s and 30s. (Such women have been giving birth at rates nearly 60% higher than just six years earlier.) Explanations include delayed marriage, economic self-sufficiency and stronger desires for a child than for a husband.    Even the &quot;traditional&quot; married couple have loosened the ties that bind. One-quarter of the marriages of women who are now in their mid-50s had broken up, on average, by the time they had reached age 43. Children of these marriages were then likely to be grown.    But consider a woman now in her mid-30s. For her generation, a quarter of all marriages had already ended by age 29, when any children involved were young.    Changing family demography is reshaping children's lives. A majority will spend some part of their youth in single-parent families; thereafter, many will enter blended families, which include stepparents and stepbrothers and sisters.    Adults who were born between 1950 and 1954 provide dramatic evidence: 19% of the whites and 48% of the blacks spent some of their youth in single-parent families.    Consider what lies ahead if current trends continue. Among those who are six years old in 1986, two out of three white children and 95% of black children will spend part of their first 18 years in single-parent families.    Conceptions of family life must allow for a growing diversity. As blended families become the norm, the responsibilities of family members become complex, ambiguous, and more open to dispute.    Social legislation narrowly designed to reinforce traditional concepts of family obligations probably won't work. (Recall how &quot;man-in-the-house&quot; rules used to break up low-income families so that children could become eligible for certain welfare benefits?) And such laws can just as readily destroy family ties as make them stronger.    ---   Mr. Morrison directs Rand Corp.'s Population Research Center. </TEXT></DOC>
