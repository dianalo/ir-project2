The measure, approved by voice vote, would establish atolerance level under which pesticide residues would beallowed as long as they wouldn't expose a person to a greaterlifetime cancer risk than one in a million.</LP><TEXT>   This would eliminate the so-called Delaney paradox. Underthe Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, achemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, thatsame chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if itfell within the Environmental Protection Agency's tolerancelevel.   Although the bill was approved, lawmakers are continuingto discuss modifications with the Bush administration andhope to work out a compromise before the measure reaches thefloor. Among possible changes are whether to allow health oreconomic factors to be taken into account when decidingwhether to allow pesticide use and whether to let federalrules override state standards.   In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee hasn't yettaken up a similar bill.</TEXT></DOC>
