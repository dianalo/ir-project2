The apparent weakness stems from the sources of evidence,largely supplied by Boesky or a few accomplices who have negotiatedagreements for leniency in exchange for information about otheralleged lawbreakers.   That suggests investigators are facing acute problems gettingcorroboration from more credible witnesses and making sense out ofthe enormous amounts of material subpoenaed in the probe.   The biggest target, the investment firm Drexel Burnham LambertInc., has yet to be formally accused of anything, although it hasbeen the subject of numerous press leaks. The Securities andExchange Commission has recommended civil charges of securities-lawviolations against the firm and some key employees.   Drexel has taken an increasingly combative approach toward thecrackdown. Drexel sources, speaking privately, have acknowledgedthat the firm's senior management is preparing for a legal brawlwith the SEC and has briefed lower-level staff on what to possiblyexpect in the weeks and months ahead.   SEC officials have declined to comment on any aspect of theDrexel matter. But people familiar with its investigation, speakingon condition of anonymity, have suggested the agency is delayingcivil charges because of an incomplete criminal probe of Drexel bythe U.S. attorney's office.   If the SEC filed civil charges first, Drexel would gainwide-ranging access to the government's evidence and witnesses,under the federal rules of pretrial evidence gathering. But Drexelwould be denied that opportunity if indicted first, becausecriminal pretrial rules are much stricter.   Drexel is not the only bottleneck in the government'sinvestigation. Prosecutors also have failed to bring new chargesagainst three Wall Street professionals arrested with greatpublicity in February 1987 after they were implicated by aconfessed Boesky accomplice, merger specialist Martin A. Siegel.   The original charges were dropped in May 1987 because thegovernment said it needed more time to prepare the case againstRobert M. Freeman, Timothy L. Tabor and Richard B. Wigton, tradingprofessionals who were accused of profiting in the stock market oninside information supplied by Siegel.   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolf Giuliani's office promised at thetime to obtain broader indictments against the trio in``record-breaking time.''   Fourteen months later, officials in the U.S. attorney's officedecline to comment on why new charges have not been filed. But thedelay suggests that prosecutors, already embarassed once, arereluctant to pursue a case without evidence that is moresubstantial than Siegel's testimony.   Lawyers for the three men express resentment over thegovernment's handling of their clients, who remain under a cloud ofsuspicion without formal charges. The lawyers have indicated theywill immediately move to dismiss any new charges on grounds theyviolate the constitutional right to a speedy trial.   One indication that the government has progressed in itsBoesky-related investigation came earlier this month when a grandjury indicted GAF Corp. and a vice chairman for alleged stockmanipulation, based on evidence supplied by another Boeskyassociate and admitted felon, Boyd L. Jefferies.   But securities lawyers have said the prosecutors could face anembarassing defeat without evidence that corroborates Jefferies'testimony. They say manipulation is one of the most difficultcrimes to prove regardless of evidence.   Even if the government triumphs in the GAF case, the results ofthe Wall Street corruption crackdown have been much milder thanfirst predicted when Boesky, one of the biggest stock speculators,was arrested in November 1986.   He paid the SEC a record $100 million to settle insider-tradingcharges and was sentenced last December to three years imprisonmenton a single felony count of conspiring to lie to the SEC. ButBoesky has yet to testify in any proceeding against others he hasimplicated.   Boesky's lawyers contend his cooperation has exceeded originalestimates, resulting in a dozen criminal charges, four guilty pleasand nine SEC administrative actions.   In arguing for a reduced sentence a few months ago, the lawyersclaimed more indictments would emerge soon, showing ``theextraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky's cooperation.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Rick Gladstone reports on business ethics andpractices for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
