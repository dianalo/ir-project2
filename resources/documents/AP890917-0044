Dole said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that President Bush is ``onthe right course'' pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from thesale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The House Waysand Means Committee last week approved the reduction.   ``Let's create some jobs. Let's make the cost of capitalcheaper,'' which would make the country more competitive on theworld market, Dole said. He conceded, though, that ``I assume theIRA politically is more popular.''   The Kansas Republican said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's proposal torestore partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs is ``a greatidea,'' but he said the proposal would cost $12 billion or more overa five-year period and ``where do you find the money?''   Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,defended his proposal on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' saying both hisplan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five yearsbefore benefits would be seen.   But he said his plan would help ``average folks _ far more peoplewould be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gainscut.''   His proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent forall IRA accounts and would allow the withdrawal of IRA funds withoutpenalty _ even prior to retirement _ for a downpayment on thepurchase of a first home or to finance college costs.   ``What it really does is get those interest rates down in thiscountry so we can be competitive with foreign nations,'' Bentsensaid. ``And it'd let people pay for that college education for theirchildren and to buy that first home that's getting tougher andtougher to accomplish.''   Bentsen said his plan could be accomplished without raisingtaxes, but pressed on where the money would be found, he said,``there's no way I can accomplish that on a show of this duration.''   On another controversial topic, Dole and Bentsen found themselvesin basic agreement, both saying they will try to block efforts torepeal the Medicare catastrophic program but will work to scale backbenefits to reduce costs to senior citizens.   ``I'm going to move the bill back to what it was when it wasoriginally introduced,'' which would give Medicare beneficiaries theoption of taking the catastrophic insurance, Bentsen said.   Both senators said they want to reduce substantially or eliminatethe surtax on Medicare beneficiaries _ a maximum of $800, or $1,600for a couple, this year _ that has raised intense and vocalopposition among the elderly.   ``Let's don't throw out all the benefits, because even thoughsenior citizens are upset, they're going to need some of thosebenefits. We've got to provide the leadership, and we've got to takethe heat for it,'' Dole said.   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a prime mover behind the programdesigned to protect the elderly against catastrophic illness, saidhe wants to see the surtax eliminated and the program scaled back tocover only hospitalization costs associated with a catastrophicillness and provisions that prevent a spouse from having toimpoverish themselves to qualify for coverage.   Other provisions, including coverage of outpatient prescriptiondrugs, should be stripped from the program to lower costs, he said.   ``We've got to repeal the surtax, keep what we can, particularlycatastrophic illness insurance, which is what we promised theAmerican people, and then go back and address the real issue thatthe seniors want in this country, and that's long term care,''McCain said on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday.''   ``I think there's a basic recognition that something needs to bedone; the question is what,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
