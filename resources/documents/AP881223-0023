Reilly, who turns 49 on Jan. 26, is president of the ConservationFoundation and of the U.S. affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, twoorganizations whose merger he engineered in 1985.   The Wildlife Fund has concentrated on preservation of wildlifeand habitat in the tropics, urging reversal of worldwidedeforestation that is clearing total acreage the size of Missourieach year.   The Conservation Foundation, which Reilly took over in 1973, is aresearch group that has sponsored several convocations of industryand environmentalists to try to resolve particular local issues.   Unlike many Washington environmental groups, it does not lobby orfile lawsuits.   The fund has been the nation's fastest-growing environmentalorganization in recent years, tripling its membership to 500,000since 1985.   During Bush's announcement ceremony Thursday, Reilly said hebelieved he was the first head of such an organization chosen to runthe EPA, and he pledged a ``new and constructive course'' onenvironmental problems at home and around the world.   In a recent interview, Reilly attributed his organization'sgrowth to the response to active solicitation among a populationexposed to a steady diet of nature programs on television.   ``The public watches enormous amounts of nature films,'' Reillysaid. ``I worry about saturation, but people who know about thesethings tell me not to.''   And, he said, ``The people who elected George Bush are worriedabout the international environment.''   Reilly has paid particular attention to the ``greenhouse effect''_ the global warming predicted to result from the use of fossilfuels. Unlike many environmentalists, he has not ruled out nuclearpower as a benign energy source, and he was considering theformation of another all-viewpoints study group on nuclear power.   He serves on the board of several non-pofit organizations and ofNortheast Utilities Inc.   He said he believed environmentalists were coming to ``two newawarenessess,'' that ``the environment is much less under controlthan we believed'' and ``the degree to which we appear to be hostageto other countries for our health and well-being.''   Though no defender of controversial former Interior SecretaryJames Watt, he said Watt's $1 billion, four-year renovation ofnational park structures ``made a lot of sense'' but ``naturalsystems didn't get the same kind of attention.''   On the parks, the Bush administration ``has got to take theexternal threats issue seriously. That's a tough issue for aconservative administration.'' Park advocates have complained thatthreats of development up against park boundaries are spoiling manyparks.   Reilly has enjoyed the confidence of the outgoing administratorof EPA, Lee M. Thomas, and Thomas' predecessor, William D.Ruckelshaus, who turned to the foundation for several studies.   During the Reagan administration, the foundation has producedthree major ``state of the environment'' documents and, among otherthings, major studies of groundwater contamination and nationalparks. Before that, it was a pioneer in calling attention to thedangers of excessive use of pesticides.   In 1984, the foundation helped organize Clean Sites Inc., whichorganizes cleanup of toxic waste by polluting companies themselves.Clean Sites was begun with chemical industry money but now getstwo-thirds of its funds elsewhere.   EPA backed a major study of wetlands by the foundation and theNational Governors Association, which recommended last month a goalof creating enough new wetlands to more than offset the loss ofbogs, swamps, fens, marshes and estuaries to development. Bush hasendorsed the ``no net loss'' goal.   Thomas turned to Reilly this fall to organize a study of theSuperfund toxic waste cleanup program that would bring industry andenvironmentalists together. The environmentalists, however, objectedthat the study could be a cover for weakening the program anddeclined to participate.   Reilly is a protege of former EPA administrator Russell Train,for whom he worked on the staff of the White House Council onEnvironmental Quality in 1970-1972. Train is now chairman of theU.S. World Wildlife Fund affiliate and of the ConservationFoundation.   Train was an adviser to Bush on environmental issues andsolicited support for Bush among environmentalists.   Thomas hailed Reilly's selection as being ``truly outstanding.''Ruckelshaus said, ``The country, the Bush administration, the peopleof EPA and our environment will all be better off.''   ``This is a positive signal from the president-elect that heintends to carry out his campaign commitments to environmentalprotection,'' said John Adams, executive director of the NaturalResources Defense Council.   A graduate of Yale University who holds a law degree from Harvardand a master's degree in planning from Columbia, Reilly was born inDecatur, Ill., spent his childhood nearby and went to high school inFall River, Mass.   After college graduation in 1962, he served in the Army,practiced law in Chicago, attended graduate scool and served asassociate director of the Urban Policy Center before joining theCouncil on Environmental Quality.</TEXT></DOC>
