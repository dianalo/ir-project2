RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked Congress fora budget increase of $1.4 million to ease what one justice said issuch a severe money pinch the court is having trouble paying fortypewriter repairs.   ``We're hurting,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told a HouseAppropriations subcommittee. ``We have a real strain on our budget.We can't keep our typewriters operating.''   The court is asking for $17.3 million for the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1, an increase of a little more than $1.4 millionover the current budget.   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., gave a mixed reception to O'Connorand Justice Antonin Scalia, who also spoke in support of the budgetrequest.   ``I'm really not that sympathetic,'' he said. ``We can't be allthings to all people.''   But later Early expressed support and urged the justices to speakout more forcefully to attract attention to the court's plight.   ``It's ludicrous to treat you the same way as anyone else,'' hesaid. ``We've got to spend more money.''   ``I don't know waht you should be doing, all threatening toresign or something,'' Early said.   Adding that the entire federal court system needs more money, hesaid, ``There's not one federal judge who couldn't leave andincrease his salary by 20 to 25 percent.''   Underscoring the point, O'Connor said she knew of one formerclerk to a Supreme Court justice who recently left for private lawpractice and ``is earning more than the justices.''   The annual salary of a Supreme Court justice is $110,000.   Included in the court's budget request are $110,000 for libraryshelves and $160,000 to improve its computer system.   O'Connor said 18 staff positions at the court have not beenfilled because of a hiring freeze imposed to meet budget restraints.   ``Every (justice's) chambers and office of the court has beenaffected by the hiring freeze,'' she said. It ``is having a negativeimpact on the efficiency and morale of remaining employees who musttake on extra work when positions become vacant.''   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, the subcommittee chairman, said, ``Youshouldn't have to put up with it. We'll see what we can do.''</TEXT></DOC>
