Though the clear wish of the German peopleis to be a part of NATO, the Soviet Union seems ready to tryto thwart that goal. Instead, the Soviets want the equivalentof continued four-power occupation. When you look at thisweek's events in Red Square, with infuriated Soviet citizenstrying to break Moscow's grip, that sounds a bit disengagedfrom reality.   The three Western Allies, with some reservations, thinkthat the Germans are entitled to have their own country oncemore. West Germany has earned that right with 45 years ofresponsible democratic behavior. East Germans won it withtheir courageous break with Moscow and vote to join the West.</LP><TEXT>   But the Soviets seem prepared to cling to the past,treating Germany like a just-conquered vassal. After earlyhints of reasonableness, they now call the German desire toremain in NATO &quot;absurd.&quot; Last month in the German weekly DerSpiegel, Valenin Falin, Mr. Gorbachev's adviser on Germanaffairs, rumbled, &quot;Either the GDR . . . fulfills its mandateand the agreements and obligations that it entered into withthe Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union, or the latent rights of theSoviet Union will become an acute question.&quot;   That sort of old-fashioned Soviet bullying, familiar toLithuanians, suggests NATO is not obsolete. The Sovietposition rests on a denial of reality. As if the democraticrevolutions of the past year never happened, they insist thatthe military demarcation of Europe should continue to rundown the middle of Germany.   The Soviets say they might remove their troops from EastGermany if the Allies remove theirs from West Germany. Butthen Germany would be in limbo, unattached to the communitythat West Germany helped build. Can the Russians really thinkthat would be a stable situation?   Some Westerners seem bent on matching the Soviet mindgames. NATO Minister Gianni de Michelis of Italy has praisedCzech President Vaclav Havel's idea of a single Europeanarmy, with the British RAF and the KGB under a singlecommand. German Chancellor Kohl has suggested a singlesecurity structure that would stretch from Iceland toVladivostok. European diplomats talk about a NATO that wouldshake off its military aspect and become a politicalalliance, whatever that means. East German President Lotharde Maiziere talks about a NATO that would be disarmed andmilitarily eviscerated.   Before the 4+2 diplomats emerge and issue a communiquesaying that the law of gravity has been repealed, it may beworth returning to the fundamental realities.   Germany is a mature democratic nation, whose future shouldnot be determined by pie-in-the-sky diplomatic maneuverings.The 4+2 structure, by revivifying World War II, has donelittle more than add legitimacy to the presence of unwantedSoviet troops on German soil. It has complicated Germanunification and provided the Soviets with a forum in which toclaim sovereignty over Germany.   Negotioholics think that by reshaping negotiatingstructures they are reshaping the world. But when diplomacydoesn't reflect reality there is only trouble ahead.   The goal that NATO officials should set before them is tospeed Soviet withdrawal from Germany. And the voters ofGermany should tell their leaders that, with all therebuilding that has to be done in the East, they are notwilling to spend one billion Deutsche marks a year to supportan occupation army.</TEXT></DOC>
