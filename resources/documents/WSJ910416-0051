The message: the mark and Kohl. SinceChancellor Helmut Kohl put through the monetary union withthe former East Germany, &quot;the mark and Kohl&quot; doesn't have thesame meaning it had two years ago: The mark has weakenedsharply.   The Germans have seen their currency destroyed twice inless than a century, in the aftermaths of the two world wars.Until now the German public's memories of those disastershave been sharp enough to permit German central bankers topursue a cautious, low-inflation policy. Lately the inflationrate in Germany has pushed well above 3%, a level Americansmight welcome but that Germans consider horrendous.</LP><TEXT>   Karl-Otto Poehl, president of Germany's central bank,thinks a major cause of the nation's current problems is lastyear's rush into a currency union with the former EastGermany. A large portion of East Germany's worthless markswas exchanged for West German marks at a one-to-one ratio.The Bundesbank vigorously opposed the rapidity of the moveand the extreme overvaluation of the East German currency.The central bank feared that Easterners would go on aspending spree for Western goods, undermining localmanufacturers, and that essentially is what happened.   Mr. Poehl bluntly declared that the economic troubles showthat the monetary union was a disaster. In a real sense theepisode was also a disaster for the Bundesbank's prestige.The German bank has been viewed as not only undergirding theGerman economy but the economy of all Europe. Some of theeconomists and politicians planning for European economicunity in the 1990s have actually speculated that theBundesbank, at least for a time, might serve as the centralbank of Europe.   The discovery that the Bundesbank is less than omnipotent,even in Germany alone, could slow the rush to Europeanmonetary unity -- a result that Mr. Poehl desires. Theproblems associated with German currency union, he told ameeting of a European Parliament committee in Brussels latelast month, should serve as a &quot;drastic illustration&quot; of themistakes the European Community must avoid as it moves towarda single currency and a European central bank.   Actually, the Bundesbank has never been as independent assome of its admirers have seemed to believe. Mr. Poehl nowmay trumpet the bank's independence, but before he came tothe Bundesbank he was for several years an official of theGerman Finance Ministry. Even before that he was, for sixyears, an economic journalist, a job that presumably left himfree to criticize just about everybody. When Mr. Poehl waselevated to the Bundesbank presidency, he was viewed as aprotege of Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt, and his rise wasviewed as a victory for the politicians -- not a gain forcentral bank independence.   Physically, the Bundesbank looks rather independent. Itsmagnificent headquarters is situated on the outskirts ofFrankfurt, some 50 miles from the central government at Bonn.When the government moves to Berlin, the politicians will beeven farther away. Whether the Bundesbank follows thegovernment to Berlin depends on what the large commercialbanks do. If they all move to Berlin, as seems likely, therewould be little reason for the central bank to stay inFrankfurt.   The central bank is generous with employee perquisites.One-third of the bank employees live in bank-owned housing,where they pay low rents. When Karl Klasen, president of thebank from 1970 to 1977, refused to move to Frankfurt, thebank arranged daily private jet transport from his home inHamburg.   There's little disagreement that the Bundesbank is themost independent of the major central banks. It has a clearmandate of independence in its conduct of monetary policy andits intervention in exchange markets. However, the FinanceMinistry does determine policy with respect to theexchange-rate system. The currency union was brought about byan agreement between the governments of the East and West,ratified by their parliaments, and Mr. Poehl and his centralbank essentially were cut out of the action.   Even in more mundane matters, the Finance Ministrymaintains a consultative role with the central bank. Thefinance minister and the economics minister routinely sit inon meetings of the Central Bank Council, a key policy-makinggroup composed of the bank's directors and the presidents ofthe various state banks. The government officials participatein all discussions but have no votes. The dispute between thebank and the government over the currency union is not thefirst, nor is it the first the bank has lost. In nearly allcases, however, any conflict has been kept strictly private.   All things considered, the Bundesbank wouldn't be a badmodel for European central banks to follow as the movecontinues toward a European central bank. At the very least,the bank's recent troubles should push Europeans to considerwhat kind of central bank they want. The recent Germanepisode indicates that even the most independent central bankhas to find a way to live with the politicians.   ---   The typewriter-printer business recently sold byInternational Business Machines, mentioned in a recentcolumn, is now operated by a new company called LexmarkInternational, not Lexmart as the column said.
