Profit Fell 77% In Fourth Period </HL><AUTHOR> Steve Swartz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TIC </CO><IN> ERN INS FIN </IN><TEXT>   Travelers Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings plummeted, largely because of heavy losses in the company's group health insurance sector.    The Hartford, Conn.-based insurer's net income fell 77% to $42.5 million, or 37 cents a share, from $185.2 million, or $1.86 a share, a year earlier.    Many health insurers are struggling with rising medical expenses and competition from health maintenance organizations -- groups of doctors and hospitals that provide health care at a preset fee.    These factors have combined to cut insurers' profits on health plans they sell to employers. At Travelers, the employee benefits sector posted an operating loss for the quarter of $57 million, compared with an operating profit of $53 million a year earlier.    &quot;This isn't a Travelers problem, it's an industry problem,&quot; said Dennis Callaghan, an insurance industry analyst at PaineWebber Inc.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Travelers' shares fell $1 to close at $37.75, with 408,200 shares changing hands.    Edward H. Budd, Travelers chairman and chief executive officer, said health insurers face a &quot;serious national problem of unprecedented levels of intensity in the utilization of medical services.&quot; He said Travelers is implementing &quot;significant price increases&quot; and using various cost control techniques to improve its performance in this sector.    Travelers' commercial property casualty business had a strong fourth quarter with operating earnings of $119.3 million, close to double the $66.7 million a year earlier. &quot;Property-casualty is at its peak&quot; in the industry, said Mr. Callaghan.    Total operating profit in the quarter declined 38% to $98.4 million from $159.1 million. Travelers also had an after-tax loss on its investments of $55.9 million in the quarter, compared with a year-earlier after-tax gain of $5.5 million.    Net income in the year-earlier period was boosted by a $20.6 million tax credit obtained by offsetting current income with prior losses.    For the year, Travelers' net income fell 31% to $374.4 million from $545.8 million. The year-earlier figure included a $41.2 million tax credit from tax-loss carry-forwards. It also included an after-tax gain of $61 million on investments, while the 1987 figure included a $54.2 million loss on investments, most in the real estate sector. Operating profit in the year dropped only 3% to $428.6 million from $443.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
