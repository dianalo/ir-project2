There was no indication the government of Gen. Saw Maung, whoseized power Sept. 18, would become liberal politically.   ``Burma will practice a market-oriented trade policy in linewith the world economic trend, both in domestic and foreigntrade,'' Trade Minister Col. Abel told a news briefing.   Abel said laws that would provide a favorable investment climatewere being drafted and welcomed queries from both domestic andforeign investors on the new policies.   He said items such as teak, petroleum and gems would remainunder government monopoly but private enterprises could becomeinvolved in all other sectors of the economy.   He said foreign investment would be permitted either directly orthrough joint ventures with the government or local privateenterprises.   But Abel said there were no plans to change the current officialexchange rate of six kyats to one dollar. Under this rate, privateexporters often receive less from their transaction than the costof the export commodity. The black market rate has soared to morethan 40 kyats to the dollar recently.   Burma's economy spiraled downward last year and the country,according to experts, is virtually bankrupt following months ofpolitical unheaval and a freeze on aid by Japan, West Germany, theUnited States and other donors.   The international community has condemned the militarygovernment for suppression of popular dissent which began late Julyfollowing the retirement of Ne Win.   Ne Win, who seized power in a 1962 military coup, imposed acentrally directed economy and banned all private foreigninvestment. Under his authoritarian rule, one of Asia's potentiallyrichest nations became among the world's poorest with an annual percapita income currently estimated at below $150.   Reaction from foreign investors to the plans Abel spelled outwas expected to be cautious, given the potentially chaoticpolitical situation and Burma's earlier backtracking on promises ofeconomic reform.   Since late July thousands have been killed by an authoritarianregime trying to maintain its power in face of nationwide protest.Saw Maung has allowed the formation of political parties andpromised a general election but opposition leaders are skepticalthat a free and fair election can be held while the military wieldpower.   The minister said cross border trade was opened at two pointswith China recently and similar arrangements were expected tofollow along Burma's frontiers with Bangladesh, India and Thailand.   In the past, the government has lost vast revenues because itwas unable to control smuggling across the country's frontiers. Theborder with Thailand, across which most commodities enter Burma, islargely controlled by ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting thecentral government.</TEXT></DOC>
