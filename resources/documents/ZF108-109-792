(fiber optics)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Coursey, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Fiber optics has been touted as the solution to mostcommunications problems, but conductivity problems still persist.andO;The biggest drawback to using fiber is that the user must sendlight through it, rather than electricity.andP;  That means the usermust pay the cost of converting electrical signals to optics atboth ends.andP;  Since fiber has these drawbacks, some companies areskeptical about installing fiber optics systems.andP;  Most certainly,fiber optics will become abundant in long-distance communications,but other than long-distance, the future for fiber optics is stilluncertain.andP;  Companies such as AT and T are working to reduce thecost of fiber optics technology.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber OpticsOutlookConductorsBandwidthCostPlanning.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
