The 5-4 opinion, written by Justice William Brennan, iscertain to force many states to boost their payments tohospitals and nursing-home services under the jointstate-federal Medicaid program. The ruling, in a case broughtby the Virginia Hospital Association, comes at a time whenhospitals around the country are complaining that states,fighting to curb rising health costs, have set reimbursementrates so low that providers lose money on Medicaid patients.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The decision is certainly good news for hospitals,&quot; saidWalter Dellinger, the Duke Law School professor who arguedthe case for the hospital association. But he also assertedthat the decision &quot;should greatly benefit the poor,&quot; who have&quot;experienced increasing difficulty in obtaining access tomedical care&quot; in the face of Medicaid funding limits.   Laurens Sartoris, president of the Virginia HospitalAssociation, said that current reimbursement rates cover only71% of the cost of care his members provide under Medicaid.To cover the loss, he said many hospitals try to boost therates they charge private patients whose bills generally arepaid by corporate health plans. The decision will helpbusiness by reducing the need for such cost-shifting, hesaid.   But the decision will make it harder for government, bothfederal and state, to hold down Medicaid spending. Washingtoncurrently spends about $40 billion a year on Medicaid, whilestates, which share the costs, spend about $30 billion. Theprogram helps two groups -- women and children and elderlynursing-home patients.   In its brief to the court, the Bush administration warnedthat a ruling in favor of the Virginia hospitals &quot;wouldvastly increase the cost of the Medicaid program to thedetriment of both state and federal governments.&quot; The federalgovernment pays more than half of the cost of the 25-year-oldMedicaid program and sets broad coverage requirements, butthe states set their own reimbursement rates.   The legal question in the case focused on the meaning of a1980 federal law that requires states to certify that theirMedicaid reimbursement rates are &quot;reasonable and adequate&quot;for efficient medical care.   The 1980 law doesn't expressly say that it may be enforcedthrough private lawsuits by Medicaid providers. But the highcourt ruled that the 1980 law gives Medicaid health-careproviders a right to sue state officials under aReconstruction-era civil rights law to force them to adoptreasonable reimbursement plans.   The ruling affirmed the decision of a federal appealscourt in Richmond, Va. The court's decision will giveproviders the right to seek higher rates in the future, butit doesn't allow them to seek repayment for past losses. TheVirginia Hospital Association has won the right to sue, butit still must prove that the state's reimbursements are toolow. The trial on the merits of the association's case isscheduled to start Dec. 17.   Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented, joined byJustices Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.The dissenters said the majority disregarded the language ofthe 1980 amendment, as well as the intent of Congress to givestates more flexibility in setting up reimbursement plans.   The ability to sue &quot;isn't going to mean any automaticwindfall&quot; for hospitals, said John Goetz, vice president andsupervisor of health-care ratings at Moody's InvestorsService Inc., because litigation and rate adjustments couldtake a long time. Urban hospitals will benefit the most fromchanges. At a hospital with a top credit rating, Medicaidreimbursement accounts for about 8% of revenue. But someinner-city institutions serving particularly poor areas,depend on Medicaid for well over half their revenue, he said.   Hospitals in several states, including Michigan andPennsylvania, have already won federal district courtdecisions requiring new reimbursement rates.   Yesterday's high court decision &quot;should give pause to manystate agencies who are looking at ways of modifying theirpayment systems to underpay the hospitals,&quot; said Kenneth E.Raske, president of the Greater New York HospitalAssociation.   Mr. Raske suggested that instead of reducingreimbursement, Medicaid agencies develop cost-controlstrategies, such as incentives to encourage Medicaidbeneficiaries to use health maintenance organizations.(Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital Association)   ---   Stephen Wermiel in Washington and Ron Winslow in New Yorkcontributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
