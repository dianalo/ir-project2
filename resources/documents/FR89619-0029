In order to issue a General Permit, NOAAFisheries was required to determine that the population stock from whicha marine mammal was to be taken was within its optimum sustainable population(OSP) and that the marine mammal stock would not be disadvantaged by theincidental take. If these determinations could not be made, a permit couldnot be issued for that particular marine mammal stock. Early in 1988 itbecame apparent that the necessary determinations to renew certain GeneralPermits could not be made and many fishermen would be forced to forgo fishingaltogether or risk substantial penalties for violating the MMPA. To addressthis problem, the Congress amended the MMPA based on a proposal developedby representatives of the fishing industry and conservation community.Section 114, added by Pub. L. 100-711 on November 23, 1988, replaces certainprovisions of the MMPA for granting incidental take authorizations (includingsmall take exemptions) to most commercial fishermen with an interim exemptionsystem until October 1, 1993. Section 114 gives commercial fishermen a5-year exemption from the incidental taking prohibition of the MMPA, providedthat certain conditions are met. The primary objective of this interimsystem is to provide a means to obtain reliable information about interactionsbetween commercial fishing activities and marine mammals while allowingcommercial fishing operations to continue despite NOAA Fisheries' currentinability to issue General Permits for many fisheries. The informationcollected in conjunction with the exemption system and information on thestatus and trends of marine mammal populations would be used to developa long-term program to govern the taking of marine mammals associated withcommercial fisheries. The Secretary of Commerce is required to providethe Congress a proposed system of authorizing incidental takes by January1, 1992. On January 27, 1989, NOAA Fisheries published an advance notice of proposedrulemaking and proposed List of Fisheries associated with the exemptionsystem (54 FR 4154) and requested comments. A final List of Fisheries categorizingfisheries as either Category I (a frequent incidental taking of marinemammals), Category II (an occasional incidental taking of marine mammals),or Category III (a remote likelihood of, or no known incidental takingof, marine mammals) (54 FR 16072) and an interim rule governing the exemptionsystem (54 FR 21910) have also been published by NOAA Fisheries. The interimrule requires that vessel owners or their authorized agents engaged ina Category I or Category II fishery register with and obtain an ExemptionCertificate from NOAA Fisheries to engage lawfully in any Category I orII fishery. This initial Exemption Certificate will be valid from July21, 1989, to December 31, 1990, provided reporting requirements are met.Subsequent Exemption Certificates would be issued on a calendar year basis(i.e., January 1 to December 31) and be issued only if reporting requirementsand other conditions of the Exemption Certificate were met.The 1988 amendments require that vessel owners holding an exemption certificatebegin compiling information regarding incidental takings of marine mammalsas of July 21, 1989. This information shall be reported at the close ofeach fishing season or annually to the Secretary of Commerce. Such reportsshall include the following: (1) The type of fishery engaged in by the owner's vessel; (2) The date and approximate time of any incidental taking of a marinemammal; (3) The area in which the incidental taking occurred; (4) The fishing gear used at the time of the incidental taking; (5) The species of fish involved; and for each incidental taking (6) The number of marine mammals involved; (7) The species of marine mammals involved; and whether the marine mammalswere (8) Deterred from gear or catch; (9) Incidentally injured; (10) Incidentally killed; or (11) Lethally removed to protect gear, catch, or human life. In addition, the 1988 amendments require vessel owners in Category IIIfisheries to report all lethal takings of marine mammals. Based on Congressionalguidance, NOAA Fisheries' interpretation of the 1988 amendments, publiccomment and meetings and consultations with State and Federal agencies,Regional Fishery Management Councils, Indian treaty tribes, and other interestedparties, NOAA Fisheries issues this proposed rule that would govern thereporting of the take of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishingoperations under the authority of section 112 and section 114(k) of theMMPA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG>NOAA Fisheries received several comments concerning the reporting systemwhen it published its advance notice of proposed rulemaking and proposedList of Fisheries (54 FR 4154). These comments are summarized below alongwith NOAA Fisheries' responses. These comments were considered in developingthis proposed rule. 1. Commenters recommended that the reporting system be easy for the fishermento use, such as using existing logbooks or fish tickets, and should clearlyexplain how a fisherman who participates in both a Category I and CategoryII fishery should report. One commenter also suggested that NOAA stressthe need to report gear damage and fish losses as well as incidental taking.One commenter recommended that NOAA Fisheries develop a reporting form,in consultation with fishermen and fishing groups, to be used in CategoryI or II fisheries. NOAA Fisheries has developed a proposed report/log form to be used in CategoryI or Category II fisheries (see Appendix), and has been discussing theform with fishing groups and other interested parties. Reports would requireinformation on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type, and fish speciesinvolved; the marine mammal species (or description of the animal, if speciesis not known), number, date, and location of marine mammal incidental takes(including takes by harassment); type of interaction and any injury tothe marine mammal; a description of any intentional takes, i.e., effortsto deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal orlethal means; and any loss of fish or gear caused by marine mammals. Withprior approval by NOAA Fisheries, alternate report forms, issued by individualstates or Fishery Management Councils, which collect the information requiredby NOAA Fisheries, would be accepted. 2. One commenter recommended that fishermen should be required to maintainthe following detailed information: The types and quantities of fishinggear carried; where, when, and how fishing gear was deployed and retrieved;the species and quantities of fish, birds, and mammals caught in each set;any fish loss, fish damage, or gear damage caused by marine mammals; ancillaryinformation, such as weather conditions or currents, thought to have contributedto the interactions with marine mammals. Some of this information would be required; however, NOAA Fisheries doesnot believe that Section 114 of the MMPA requires all fishermen to maintainsuch detailed records. Collection of additional detailed information, however,may be incorporated in an alternate verification program. 3. One commenter recommended that fishermen be required to report all takings,not just entanglement, serious injury, or death, since they may not bequalified to judge what is ``serious'' and all information and data arenecessary to assess the magnitude of the incidental take problem. Anothercommenter believed that only entanglements, serious injuries, or deathsshould be considered to be incidental takes for reporting purposes.Section 114(c) requires fishermen to report ``whether the marine mammalswere deterred from gear or catch, incidentally killed, or lethally removedto protect gear, catch, or human life.'' Therefore, NOAA Fisheries proposesto require the reporting of all takings, including harassment, that occurincidental to a Category I or Category II fishery. 4. Commenters were fearful how the report data would be used, and thatisolated instances might subject a fishery to unnecessary restrictions.Another commenter was fearful that the lack of mortality reports in CategoryIII fisheries will be interpreted as a failure to report (rather than thelack of taking) which will prompt stricter requirements in the future.Report data would be evaluated in conjunction with data from observer andalternative verification programs and other available information. NOAAFisheries does not intend to restrict fisheries unless the best availableinformation indicates that marine mammal stocks are being adversely affected.Because Category III fisheries have a remote likelihood of taking a marinemammal, NOAA Fisheries expects few such reports. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting Requirements </ITAG>Exemption Certificate holders would be required to maintain accurate dailylogs of fishing effort, incidental takes of marine mammals, and other informationdetermined necessary by the Assistant Administrator in such form as prescribedby NOAA Fisheries. A current report/log form would have to be kept on boardcovering the current fishing trip and would have to be made available forinspection upon request by any state or federal enforcement agent authorizedto enforce the MMPA or designated agent of NOAA Fisheries. NOAA Fisherieswould provide report/log forms for recording the information required toall Exemption Certificate holders for use in maintaining records and filingreports. These reports, consisting of a copy of the required daily log, would berequired for each vessel engaged in a Category I and Category II fishery,whether or not marine mammals were taken. Reports would be submitted atthe end of each fishing season or an annual report would be submitted toNOAA Fisheries on or before December 31 of each year covering all CategoryI and II fisheries for which each Exemption Certificate holder is registered.The submission of reports on a regular basis throughout the year, however,would be encouraged. Exemption Certificate renewal requests would includethese reports, if not previously submitted, or a new Exemption Certificatewould not be issued. If a fishing vessel was not used in a Category I orCategory II fishery during a calendar year for which it was registered,a report to that effect would be required. With prior approval by NOAAFisheries, alternate report forms, issued by individual states or FisheryManagement Councils, which collect the information required by NOAA Fisheries,would be accepted. Marine mammal report/log forms would require information on: The fishery,fishing effort, gear type and fish species involved; the marine mammalspecies (or description of the animal, if species is not known), number,date, and location of marine mammal incidental takes (including takes byharassment); type of interaction and any injury to the marine mammal; adescription of any intentional takes, i.e., efforts to deter animals toprotect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal or lethal means; and anyloss of fish or gear caused by marine mammals. The proposed report/logform which would be used to collect this information is included as anAppendix. Vessel owners engaged in Category III fisheries would report all lethalincidental takings of marine mammals by contacting the nearest NOAA FisheriesOffice within 10 days of the return from the fishing trip during whichthe incidental take occurred. NOAA Fisheries would then incorporate thisinformation into its data management system. <ITAG tagnum="84">Information Management </ITAG>NOAA Fisheries is developing an information management system to compile,store, process, and analyze data received from fishermen's reports, observerand verification programs, and other sources. To protect the confidentialityof this data, information from the system will be made available to thepublic only in an aggregate form which does not directly or indirectlydisclose the identity or business of any person. Such information wouldbe available on a continuing basis, no later than six months after receipt.Depending on the nature of information requests, appropriate user feesmay be charged for the information. To maintain the confidentiality of individual vessel owner reports, onlytheir Exemption Certificate number, Coast Guard documentation number, stateregistration number, and the fisheries the vessel was engaged in wouldbe required on the individual report/log forms. Further, confidential orproprietary information would not be disclosed except: (1) To Federal employees requiring such information, including to Federalcontractors that are authorized to collect, process or analyze report orobserver data and that are bound by the restrictions on public releaseof such data; (2) To State employees under agreement with NOAA Fisheries that preventspublic disclosure of the identity or business of any person; (3) When required by court order; or(4) In the case of scientific information involving fisheries, to employeesof Regional Fishery Management Councils. Under exceptions (1) and (3) above, information from observers or fromfishermen reports indicating a violation of the MMPA, regulations, or termsand conditions of Exemption Certificates may be used in civil or criminalenforcement proceedings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator has determined that implementation of the regulationsof 50 CFR Part 229 will not have a significant impact on the human environment.NOAA Fisheries has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) on this action.The finding of that EA was that no significant impact on the human environmentwill occur as a result of this rule and that no environmental impact statementwas required. The EA is available upon request (see <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>). The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, Department of Commerce,has determined that this rule is not a major rule requiring a regulatoryimpact analysis under Executive Order 12291. This rule would not resultin (1) an annual major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, or government agencies; (2) an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; or (3) a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that the addition of 50 CFR 229.06(c) and229.07(b) to the regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. NOAA Fisheries has reviewedthe proposed rule and has initially determined that the economic impactof this rule is limited to the amount of time necessary for registeredfishermen to enter daily whether they had an interaction with any marinemammals. NOAA Fisheries estimates that on average this will require 2.5minutes per day fished for fishermen operating in Category I or II fisheries.NOAA Fisheries estimates that on average commercial fishermen operatingin Category III fisheries will spend 20 minutes per year to record andreport the incidental take of marine mammals. As a result, a regulatoryflexibility analysis was not prepared. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for approval. The collection which is subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct is found at 50 CFR 229.06(c) and 229.07(b). Public reporting burdenfor this collection of information is estimated to average 2.5 minutesper day fished for fishermen operating in Category I or II fisheries toreport the incidental take of marine mammals. These estimates include thetime for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. NOAA Fisheriesestimates that on average commercial fishermen operating in Category IIIfisheries will spend 20 minutes per year to record and report the incidentaltake of marine mammals. Send comments regarding these burden estimatesor any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden, to the National Marine Fisheries Service, MMPAExemption Task Force, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910,and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (Attn. NOAA Desk Officer). NOAA Fisheries has determined that this rule does not directly affect thecoastal zone of any State that has an approved coastal zone managementprogram under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). These actions arebeing taken under the MMPA which grants exclusive authority to the Federalgovernment to regulate the takings of marine mammals. This rule imposesadditional registration and reporting requirements on a small segment ofthe fishing industry but the nature of these requirements by themselvesdo not have a direct effect on the coastal zone of any state. This determinationhas been submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the CZMA. This rule has been determined not to contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O.12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 229 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing vessels, Marine mammals, Reporting and recordkeeping.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation Promulgation </ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR is proposed to be amendedas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 229_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
