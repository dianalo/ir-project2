The industry's oldest and largest trade grop _ the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions _ says Congress should preserve Sandamp;Ls as aseparate system because they're important to home lending.   On the other hand, Sandamp;Ls don't want to give up the new investmentpowers they acquired through the Reagan administration's program ofderegulation.   At the trade group's 96th annual convention in Honolulu lastweek, its leaders promised to push for tougher supervision.   But last month when banking regulators asked Congress for powerto levy daily fines against rule-breaking institutions, the industrydidn't support the request.   Sandamp;Ls say they don't want their regulator, the Federal Home LoanBank Board, merged with commercial bank agencies. But, neither dothey want the government to block healthy Sandamp;Ls from fleeing theproblems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. by joiningthe banks' deposit insurance fund.   ``They want to have their cake and eat it both,'' said H. JoeSelby, a Dallas consultant and former top regulator in the FederalHome Loan Bank of Dallas.   The FSLIC, which insures deposits in the nation's 3,048 savingsand loans is in deep trouble. Sixteen percent of its memberinstitutions are insolvent and another 13 percent are dangerouslyclose to it, with capital levels of less than 3 percent of theirloans and other assets.   Sandamp;L executives say they can't provide the estimated $45 billionto $50 billion to that will be needed to prop up the insurance fundwithout toppling the healthy institutions into insolvency too.   But, they also know that if taxpayers pay, Congress will attachconditions designed to prevent a repeat of the disaster.   Fearful that those conditions will spell the end of a savingsindustry separate from banking, the U.S. League is portraying Sandamp;Lsas partners in the American dream of home ownership.   ``They're trying to tug on the heart strings of Congress in orderto loosen up the purse strings,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, a privateanalyst who was formerly chief economist of the bank board.   But, Brumbaugh said, the Sandamp;L organization will be handicappednext year by the belief in Congress that it has been ``tacking backand forth somewhat erratically.''   In 1986 and 1987, when the administration pushed for a $15billion, industry-funded bond issue to provide cash to the insurancefund, the lobby group tried to hold it to $5 billion, eventuallycompromising on $10.8 billion.   ``The perception is that the U.S. League understood the problemwas greater but disengenously argued for less than was needed,''Brumbaugh said.   While Sandamp;L leaders at the convention called for a return to basicmortgage lending, few were willing to go back entirely to the olddays of tight restrictions on thrifts' investments.   ``Some of these areas need to be looked at, but we don't want tosee a wholesale rolling back of what an Sandamp;L can do,'' said RoyGreen, president of County Savings Bank, Santa Barbara, Calif., aformer U.S. League chairman.   Sandra K. Johnigan of Coast-to-Coast Financial Corp. of New Yorksays thrifts need power to invest in a variety of higher-earningventures in order to attract money from new private investors.   ``It's not possible to get thrifts out of trouble with justmortgage lending,'' she said.   U.S. League leaders say they would accept some new restrictions,including limits on commercial real estate lending and oninvestments in junk bonds, but the better answer is strongsupervision by federal examiners.   Theo H. Pitt Jr., a North Carolina Sandamp;L executive who justfinished his term as U.S. League chairman, said the Reaganadministration in the early 1980s ignored industry pleas for moreexaminers.   However, at the same time, U.S. League promotional material bragsabout newspaper stories calling it a ``formidably effective'' lobby.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, said Sandamp;L leaders areengaging in ``revisionist history'' if they claim they were strongproponents of more supervision.   ``If they are the lobbying power they would have people believe,they either opposed enforcement or they failed to be effective inassisting us,'' Wall said in an interview.   He said the league missed an important opportunity last month tohelp regulators get an enforcement tool somewhere in betweenshooting _ closing an Sandamp;L down _ and a slap on the wrist _ a warningletter.   A bill authorizing regulators to impose fines died beforeCongress adjourned.   Brumbaugh, who believes that Sandamp;Ls have closer ties with theirregulators than perhaps any other industry, said the U.S. League isstriving to maintain a separate thrift system because its leadersbelieve they will lose power if they don't.   However, the league also defends the right of better off Sandamp;Ls toleave the FSLIC, which charges insurance premiums 2{ times thepremium charged by the banks' fund.   Frederick L. Webber, a former Ford administration assistantTreasury secretary installed Thursday as the U.S. League's newpresident, acknowledged his group has a ``credibility problem'' withWashington.   ``Without passing judgment on what happened before I got here ...I'm going to do everything I can to restore our credibility. ... Ialong with my staff and my elected leaders are going to tell thetruth,'' he said in an interview.   Webber also acknowledged tension within the league betweeninstitutions that have stuck primarily with mortgage lending andthose who have ventured into new areas.   ``I'm not saying we don't have room for the other people (whohave diversified) but they have to understand that both forpolitical and business reasons, we have to stick to our knitting,''he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Dave Skidmore covers financial issues for TheAssociated Press in Washington.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Nov 7</NOTE><TEXT>      File Stored As: mf5 h10 0991 11:19 11-04 ----- aabx AM-Sandamp;LTroubles,ADV07</TEXT><HEAD>NY Genl _ pl</HEAD></DOC>
