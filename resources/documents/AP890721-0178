Critics complained that Bush wasnot living up his vow to be the environmental president.   Officially signing off on the bill in a Rose Garden ceremony,Bush said that, if approved, ``this piece of legislation will seeto it that every American in every city in America will breatheclean air.   ``It will stop the degredation that's been caused by acid rainby the end of this century and it will cut airborne toxic chemicalsfrom major sources by at least 75 percent.''   The bill, if approved by Congress, would:   _Require reductions in emissions that cause acid rain.   _Set deadlines for cities to comply with ozone-reductionstandards through such measures as the use of alternative fuels.   _Tighten tailpipe emission standards for cars.   _Create a regulatory system to crack down on industrial sourcesof airborne toxic chemicals.   But environmental activists, congressional critics and even asponsor of the president's own package said it was not enough.Critics contended that in some areas the proposal would actuallyweaken existing laws.   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the ranking Republican on theSenate Environment Committee and the legislator who will sponsorthe Senate version of Bush's bill, told reporters, ``We don't agreewith all of it.''   Chafee said he will push to tighten auto emission standards inthe bill and would be astounded if a clean air bill could pass byyear's end.   But, as environmental groups and members of Congress rushed tocriticize various sections of the package, Chafee also said suchcomments were unjustified.   ``Sure, it doesn't do everything they want, but who in this towngets everything they want?'' he asked.   For their part, the Big Three auto companies all said theythought it would be difficult to meet the requirements of the Bushproposal. A Ford Motor Co. statement, for example, said: ``Webelieve the president's bill takes the nation in the rightdirection and we support his vision. But meeting the specificprovisions will stretch our technical capabilities to the limits.''   William Fay, head of the Clean Air Working Group, a utilityorganization, said, ``Assertions by some that this is a weak billare simply ludicrous.''   Fay said the acid rain provisions would not only requireutilities to reduce emissions from their current generating output,but would force them into even costlier controls if they sought toincrease capacity, and the alternative auto fuel proposals amountedto ``a disincentive to make gasoline burn cleaner.''   In light of the attacks, Bush told the Rose Garden gatheringthat ``clean air is too important to be a partisan issue.''   He said he had worked to balance a range of concerns _``economic growth, job creation, environemntal protection,mobility, unfettered commerce.''   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief Senate sponsor of separateclean-air legislation, said the language of Bush's bill ``willsignificantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president.''   ``The president stepped up to the problem, blinked and steppedback,'' Baucus said, contending that the president's bill wouldactually increase motor vehicle emissions, allow cities too muchtime to clean their air and give too much weight to cost in toxicchemical cleanup.   Critics claimed Bush conceded too much to industry.   They complained that instead of setting rigid standards, thebill would give the EPA excessive discretion on emission standardsfor cars, trucks and buses, and create too much flexibility for theEPA administrator, local governments and industry in takingmeasures to reduce ozone pollution, acid rain and airborne toxicchemicals.   In addition, the legislation would allow the EPA to considerindustry's economic costs in making key decisions.   Chafee and others said they were concerned about a provision toallow automakers to meet the tailpipe emission standards forhydrocarbons by using a fleet average, rather than requiring eachmodel to meet the standard.   ``Quite frankly, we're hearing from local officials ... who saythey just won't be able to succeed in cleaning up their citiesunless some changes are made in the bill,'' to further tightenemission standards, said Joe Goffman, senior attorney for theEnvironmental Defense Fund.   Using the fleet-average method ``would allow half of the cars toexceed pollution limits, so long as the standards are met on theaverage'' for a manufacturer, predicted Rep. Henry A. Waxman,D-Calif. ``It's a shell game.''   The EPA denied the auto emission section would allow morepollution, but Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that part ofthe bill ``looks like a relief package for Detroit and Tokyo.''</TEXT></DOC>
