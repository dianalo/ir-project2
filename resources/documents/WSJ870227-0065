The Senate committee also took the first step toward compelling Richard Secord, a retired Air Force general who is a key figure in the scandal, to disclose his foreign bank records.    The two panels moved to grant so-called limited-use immunity to Fawn Hall, former secretary to Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was fired as an aide to the National Security Council for his role in the scandal; Edward de Garay, president of Corporate Air Services Inc., which may be linked to the effort to supply the U.S.-backed Contra rebels; and Robert Dutton, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel and associate of Mr. Secord.    Yesterday's actions came as, separately, a special commission appointed by President Reagan to investigate the affair also released a report that was highly critical of President Reagan and his senior advisers.    Ms. Hall worked closely with Col. North and is believed to have given details about his activities at the NSC. She has told investigators that she helped Col. North shred certain documents and remove or alter others when the Iran and Contra operations were beginning to unravel late last year. Ms. Hall already has received a written promise of immunity from Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel who was appointed to investigate the scandal.    A source on the House panel said that the committee wants Mr. de Garay to testify about certain activities involving the Contras, the U.S.-backed rebels who are battling Nicaragua's leftist government. Investigators are looking into the funneling of profits to the Contras from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran.    Eugene Hasenfus, an American who was on an aircraft shot down last autumn by the Nicaraguans while it was dropping supplies to the Contras, has said he was hired by Mr. de Garay's company. The incident provided one of the first indications of U.S. involvement in the supply operation during a time when such activities were prohibited by Congress.    Mr. Dutton is believed to have helped oversee the Contra supply operation. In addition, according to a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, he was in Tel Aviv, Israel, in the fall of 1985 supervising the loading of a plane carrying TOW antitank missiles to Iran.    Investigators say that Mr. Secord was one of the major figures in the private network used by Col. North in both the Iran and Contra operations. Along with Col. North, he is believed to have controlled secret Swiss bank accounts that held the funds involved in the affair.    To initiate civil proceedings to compel Mr. Secord to disclose his bank records, the Senate committee and the full Senate first must pass resolutions. After that, the Senate panel could go to a federal district court that would, in effect, give Mr. Secord the choice of either disclosing the records or facing imprisonment. The committee said this procedure has been sanctioned by several federal district courts.    The committee said that it has been informed by Mr. Secord's lawyer that he would oppose such an order, which the panel's counsel said he expected will be made within 30 days. Last year, Mr. Secord refused to testify before congressional committees, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.    A spokesman for the House committee said the panel will notify Mr. Walsh and Attorney General Edwin Meese of its decision to grant immunity to the three figures in the Iran-Contra affair. The panel then will take the matter to federal district court here.    The committee spokesman said that if neither Mr. Walsh nor Mr. Meese object to granting the immunity, the court would authorize the grants in 10 days. He said that if there is an objection, the court must wait 20 days, but then would have to grant the immunity.    Mr. Walsh's office already has agreed to the immunity grant, according to Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the panel. </TEXT></DOC>
