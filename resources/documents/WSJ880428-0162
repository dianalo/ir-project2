At our house, it always rings at dinnertime, and the caller is usually some huckster peddling junk bonds or aluminum siding. It rings in the middle of the night, and all kinds of images of a child or a parent in trouble pass through my mind before I hear some drunk asking for someone who doesn't live here. It rings early in the morning, and I scurry from the shower to hear a small voice asking for the small voice in my household to see what the spelling words are for the test today.    I'm not crazy about pornography, either.    At the newsstand, it sits there blaring all kinds of words and suggestions that I wish my children wouldn't see or hear. At the video shop, it entices teen-agers with a view of the world that is unreal and unappetizing. Across the land, it rakes in millions of dollars that could be spent on better things.    So it figures, then, that I'm also not crazy about dial-a-porn. Dial-a-porn lets you -- or your children or anyone else using your phone -- dial a special number and hear a seamy, steamy taped message from a professional panter. A few dollars are automatically added to your phone bill each time you dial up these obscenarios.    And lots of people dial. One estimate puts revenue at $54 million annually.    I'm not the only one upset by all this. Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Rep. William Dannemeyer of California got so incensed that they took a major education bill and craftily attached a rider that bans dial-a-porn for one and all, adult and child alike. Both houses have passed the bill, and President Reagan is expected to sign it shortly.    When he signs it, it will be a great day for the smut-battlers.    And a sorry day for freedom.    For banning dialed-up sex talk, noble as it sounds, is a terribly dangerous act. It silences our speech. It smothers our freedom. It tramples on our Constitution.    The House vote last week was a &quot;fundamentally flawed enactment which intrudes on the privacy and free speech rights of American adults,&quot; said Barry Lynn of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU, which seems to care far more about our rights than do the men and women we elect to preserve them, now will see the matter through the courts. That will take years, of course.    Mr. Lynn notes that when this bill is signed it will be the 32nd federal obscenity law, and that such laws &quot;are rarely enforced because of a growing sentiment among potential jurors that adults have a right to read, see and hear what they want in the privacy of their own homes.&quot;    So what Sen. Helms, Rep. Dannemeyer and President Reagan are about to hand us is an unworkable, unwise and, it is to be hoped, unconstitutional statute that ultimately will do nothing about the real problem, which is the use of the phone lines by youngsters.    The zeal of these zealots is puzzling. For there is a way to deal with the issue without burking freedom. The technology exists so that the dial-a-something services -- dial-a-porn, dial-a-preacher, dial-an-oddsmaker -- can be regulated by the phone company or by the phone owner. With some technology, a phone company could simply block a resident's line at his request so that no one could make those dial-it numbers from his house. With other technology, the home-owner could install relatively cheap equipment to make sure that his children couldn't make the calls. The industry stands ready to cooperate. (A company also can choose not to carry dial-a-porn, as is the case in Arizona.)    It's all so simple, but for one thing: There's no political gain for the Helmses in that kind of a lawful, logical solution.    &quot;Let the Supreme Court rule on constitutionality. Congress's role is to adopt public policy that measures the will of the people,&quot; Rep. Dannemeyer was quoted as saying in the New York Times.    That, of course, is a way to get votes -- especially in Orange County, Calif., whence Mr. Dannemeyer hails -- but that is not the role of Congress. The role of Congress is to do what's right and, especially, to protect our freedoms.    Almost all would agree that kids shouldn't be running up phone bills by dialing dirty talkers; it's bad for the parent's wallet and probably bad for the child's mind. But the argument can't be made that adults shouldn't be able to call these smut lines if they want to.    Thirty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that it was wrong to &quot;reduce the adult population . . . to reading only what is fit for children.&quot; Hollywood can make movies that cater to adults. Publishers can print books that are suitable mainly for adults. Editors can edit magazines with adult audiences in mind. It stands to reason that dial-it entrepreneurs should be able to offer services that cater to the man on the street or the weirdo in the park.    If Rep. Dannemeyer doesn't want people dialing pornography from his house, let him bar it with technology. If Sen. Helms doesn't like dial-a-porn, he needn't dial and listen. But if you or I want to -- and I don't, but it's all right with me if you do -- we should be able to.    But, soon, we won't be able to. Sometimes, consenting adults do obscene things -- especially the consenting adults of Congress.    ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune in Ames, Iowa. </TEXT></DOC>
