In nominating Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire,President Bush chose a strict constructionist who he hopeswill satisfy conservatives, but a man whose lack of anyarticulated stand on abortion may make him acceptable tomoderates in the party. And by moving within 72 hours ofgetting an opening, the president short-circuited efforts byactivists to campaign for a nominee that took their side onthe abortion issue.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Souter, who will turn 51 during his Senateconfirmation hearings this fall, is a former member of theNew Hampshire Supreme Court. State courts, however, rarelyhear abortion cases. In his current post on the federalbench, as a member of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appealsin Boston, he has spent exactly one day hearing cases. Duringhis confirmation proceedings for that job -- he waseventually approved unanimously -- he told the Senate he hadgiven no speeches worthy of reporting.   &quot;He doesn't talk much about abortion, even to his closestfriends,&quot; says Thomas Rath, a former New Hampshire attorneygeneral.   Mr. Souter doesn't have any reputation for the kind ofconservative judicial activism that aroused fierce oppositionto President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in 1987. &quot;Heisn't a politician or an ideologue, and he's not muchaffected by contemporary political winds at all,&quot; saysGregory Smith, another former New Hampshire attorney general.   Even Clesson Blaisdell, the dean of Democrats in the NewHampshire state senate, says, &quot;I can't say anything bad abouthim.&quot; Mr. Blaisdell's words may carry some extra weight inWashington: He co-chaired the 1988 New Hampshire presidentialcampaign of Delaware Democrat Joseph Biden, the chairman ofthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which will decide on JudgeSouter's nomination. Mr. Blaisdell is offering to speak toSen. Biden on the judge's behalf.   &quot;He'll interpret the law,&quot; Mr. Blaisdell says of JudgeSouter. &quot;He won't be there representing one side or theother.&quot;   In one of Judge Souter's few actions regarding abortion,he joined with a majority on the New Hampshire Supreme Courtin 1986 ruling that a woman who gave birth to a seriouslydeformed child could sue her doctors because she wasn'tadequately informed of abortion as an option in her case.That decision may give pause to anti-abortion activists, whogenerally see such &quot;wrongful birth&quot; decisions as promotingabortion. On the other hand, Judge Souter wrote a separateopinion expressing concern that the ruling would requiredoctors to engage in abortion counseling of their patients,even if they opposed abortion.   According to some of his friends, Mr. Souter's selectionfollows a behind-the-scenes campaign waged on his behalf by agroup of New Hampshire Republican politicians led by Sen.Warren Rudman and former Gov. John Sununu, now White Housechief of staff. They have been promoting Mr. Souter for theSupreme Court ever since the Bork nomination failed. &quot;It'slike having your younger brother put on the court,&quot; Mr.Rudman said last night. Mr. Sununu officially recused himselffrom the choice of a successor to the liberal and activistJustice William Brennan.   Paul McEachern, a Democrat who became an avowed Sununuadversary in losing two gubernatorial campaigns to him,yesterday termed the Souter nomination an eminent one. &quot;He'sperfect politically,&quot; he said. &quot;He defuses a huge problem forBush because he has found a man with views that aren't reallyon one side or the other. They're not going to pin him downon abortion.&quot;   &quot;If they wanted somebody who wasn't controversial, hewould be the ideal choice,&quot; added Rep. Chuck Douglas, a NewHampshire Republican.   By many accounts, Judge Souter is a solitary man who loveshis books. Never married, listed in Who's Who as anEpiscopalian, he lives in Weare, N.H. -- population,approximately 2,000 -- in an old farmhouse distinguished by aliving room &quot;so cluttered with books there's a path to whereyou can sit among the books,&quot; says Mr. Rath, the former stateofficial. He is a 1966 Harvard Law School graduate and RhodesScholar who drives a dilapidated car. He hikes in the WhiteMountains and has conquered all the 4,000-footers in thearea.   Though ambiguous on abortion, Mr. Souter's views on avariety of other issues are decidedly conservative. On theNew Hampshire Supreme Court he wrote numerous decisions incriminal cases, generally taking a tough stance andrecognizing society's interests in being protected.   In 1985, for instance, the New Hampshire court ruled thatthe state constitution barred police from setting uproadblocks to catch drunken drivers. Judge Souter was theonly dissenter, saying the technique provided substantialbenefits to society and minimal intrusion on individualrights. This year, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted his view ina 6-3 ruling in a Michigan case. Justice Brennan, whom Mr.Souter would replace, dissented.   Mr. Souter's record on civil rights cases is also brief --though, again, conspicuously conservative. He joined in a1987 ruling restricting the rights of homosexuals to adoptchildren. Sen. Rudman described a case in which the judgeruled that testimony about a rape victim's behavior towardsome men in a bar was admissible. Women's groups attackedthat decision.   When he was New Hampshire attorney general earlier in hiscareer, Mr. Souter made a special appearance in court toplead with a judge not to give suspended sentences to some1,400 protesters arrested at the Seabrook nuclear plant. As ajudge he generally joined in rulings in favor of PublicService Co. of New Hampshire in connection with Seabrook.   Conservative activists, though generally issuingremarkably dispassionate statements about the nomineeyesterday, were crossing their fingers that Mr. Souter'sadherence to strict constitutional interpretation would alsomake him an anti-abortion jurist. The National Right to LifeCommittee took comfort in Mr. Bush's assurances that he wasnominating a justice who would &quot;interpret the Constitutionaccording to its text.&quot; Robert Billings, legislative directorof the American Conservative Union, said that &quot;we don't havewritten cases yet or written opinions yet, but we feel theopinions he has written on various cases point to the factthat he's a strict constructionist.&quot;   If the Senate Judiciary Committee members &quot;want to getinto some heavy questioning on Roe vs. Wade {the caserecognizing a right to abortion}, it will be a little bit ofa battle,&quot; Mr. Billings said. &quot;If pushed to the wall, he'dhave to say Roe vs. Wade is bad jurisprudence&quot; because of hisjudicial philosophy, Mr. Billings maintained. Kate Michelman,executive director of the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague, raised questions about confirming &quot;a nominee withoutknowing&quot; his abortion views.   President Bush, for his part, expressed annoyance at theheavy focus on the abortion issue and tried to downplay itssignificance. &quot;You might just think the whole nomination hadsomething to do with abortion,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;And it's farbroader than that. I have too much respect for the SupremeCourt than to look at one specific issue and one alone.&quot;   Rather, Mr. Bush insisted that he chose Judge Souterbecause of his broader conservative judicial philosophy,without looking in detail into any issues or cases. He saidhe never asked Judge Souter his views on abortion.   &quot;What I'm certain of is that he will interpret theConstitution and not legislate from the federal bench,&quot; Mr.Bush said. &quot;We've got a nominee here who is extraordinarilyintelligent, has a record, has been confirmed by the Senate,and who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal levelas to his objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy. AndI am satisfied as to all those counts.&quot;   Mr. Bush made his selection so quickly because he wantedto &quot;let the debate focus on the nominee and his talents&quot;rather than &quot;get a lengthy debate started that would stirover a bunch of issues that wouldn't be relevant,&quot; saidpresidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Mr. Bush first metJudge Souter Sunday night in the presidential residence, thenheld a second meeting with him yesterday at the White Houseto officially offer him the nomination, Mr. Fitzwater said.   The White House's quick action has the effect ofshort-circuiting efforts by those Republicans who favorabortion rights: They were preparing to send out 10,000telegrams urging support of a nominee who takes such a stand.The speed also cut short deliberations among conservativeactivists over whether to endorse a particular person beforethe president chose.   Judge Souter's prior nomination slipped through byunanimous consent in a sparsely-attended, Friday-eveningSenate session on April 27. Several members of the JudiciaryCommittee admitted that they recalled nothing about thepanel's brief hearings when Judge Souter was nominated to theFirst Circuit.   &quot;If the president hadn't indicated that he was a member ofthe First Circuit Court of Appeals, I'm not sure I would haveknown,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, andone of eight Democrats on the committee. &quot;I stand in theposition of practically every other member of the SenateJudiciary Committee: Judge Souter is pretty much a blankslate.&quot;   But Mr. Metzenbaum added, &quot;So far, in the last couple ofhours, I haven't heard anything against him.&quot;   Mr. Souter has a powerful sponsor in Sen. Rudman, who saidhe urged Mr. Sununu, then governor, to appoint Judge Souterto the New Hampshire court. At the time, Mr. Sununu couldbarely contain his admiration for the judge. &quot;When I'm oldand gray,&quot; he said at Mr. Souter's swearing-in ceremony in1983, &quot;people will say, `This is one of the greatest thingsyou did as governor.'&quot;   ---   Gerald F.
