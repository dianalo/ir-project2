Lines formed outside some of the nation's 17 state liquor stores.Waiting patrons applauded when the Snorra Braut liquor store incentral Reykjavik opened for business at 9 a.m.   Icelanders voted for prohibition in a 1908 referendum. The lawdidn't take effect until 1915, when it was assumed the lastalcoholic beverage on the island had been drunk.   The ban was repealed in 1933, but through a legal quirk beer withalcoholic content above 2.25 percent remained under prohibition. Apowerful temperance lobby kept it that way until May when Parliamentvoted 13-8 to lift the ban effective March 1.   ``This is a truly historic moment in my life and the life of thisnation,'' said Pall Sverrisson, a cab driver. ``This is what we havebeen fighting for, and this is what we have been dreaming of for solong.''   Many restaurants and bars reported their tables had been bookedweeks in advance by customers planning to celebrate.   The luxury doesn't come cheap.   With the government levying a hefty tax, liquor stores arecharging up to $57.60 for a 24-can case of imported beer. A glass ofbeer in a bar costs $3.90 to $4.80.   Education Minister Svavar Gestsson, who campaigned againstlifting the ban, accused the media of hyping the occasion and saidefforts to educate people on the dangers of drink ``have proved invain against this terrible flood.''   Reykjavik Police Chief Boedvar Bragason said his force was onheightened alert for drunken drivers.</TEXT></DOC>
