Adding downward pressure on soybean futures prices were U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter's comments at a White House press briefing that the U.S. may have to reduce &quot;export-enhancement&quot; agricultural subsidies because of serious drought conditions in farming areas.    &quot;There is still nervousness out there about this rally, even though all the weather forecasts say hot and dry,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. on the Chicago Board of Trade. He said that some traders may have sold yesterday in anticipation of more profit-taking today ahead of the weekend when the markets are closed.    Richard Dennis, head of Candamp;D Commodities and one of the most active futures speculators in Chicago, said, &quot;we may be close to a short-term top in beans.&quot;    Low Mississippi River levels that are hampering barge traffic appeared to affect soybean futures prices as well, Mr. Lespinasse said. He noted that soybean futures for July delivery gained 21.5 cents, compared with a 14.5-cent advance for November soybean contracts, reflecting the possibility of reduced supplies of grain in Chicago and Toledo if beans for export have to be shipped via the Great Lakes, rather than down the Mississippi.    Corn futures prices closed up the permissible daily limit in the near-month contracts. The Board of Trade increased the daily limit to 15 cents for three days beginning yesterday, after the contract gained the previous daily limit of 10 cents for two consecutive days.    The nation's corn crop, more so than soybeans, &quot;is in imminent danger of not getting the moisture it needs,&quot; said Richard Loewy, a futures analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.    In other commodity markets yesterday: -   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended mixed as late selling trimmed early gains. August delivery gold ended $1.90 an ounce lower at $453.90, after trading as high as $459.00. July silver advanced to as much as $7.30 an ounce, before slipping to close at $7.14, down 1.5 cents from Wednesday. July platinum, after trading up to $595.00, settled at $579.80 an ounce, up $2.80. According to one analyst, prices initially rose in line with continued strength in grains and soybeans, but then began gradually eroding and were further hit by a late wave of selling. Another analyst observed that while inflationary sentiment was fanned by grain and soybean advances, softer petroleum prices counterbalanced this to some extent. A third analyst said gold appeared to be stuck in a trading range, with $450 representing a significant support point. &quot;That's the level at which demand for gold appears from both the Far East and Middle East,&quot; he said. That demand is giving the market support but prices aren't rising strongly because buyers refuse to chase advances, the analyst said.    COPPER: Futures prices ended lower after an early advance. July delivery copper settled at $1.0380, down 1.10 cents, after trading as high as $1.08. Analysts said traders decided to take profits after significant advances over the past three weeks. One analyst observed that demand for copper, while down a little from this time last year, is still near record levels and that futures markets both in New York and London continue to retain premiums for nearby contracts over more distant ones. Another analyst said traders on the whole are cautious as the industry enters its traditionally slower consuming summer season, &quot;but demand is holding up much better than had been expected.&quot;    COCOA: Futures prices plunged to new life-of-contract lows despite the absence of any new developments. September delivery cocoa ended $75 a metric ton lower at $1,521. At one point September traded at $1,510, a new low, dipping below $1,555 set on April 12. &quot;There doesn't seem to be any reason that I can find for such a severe drop, except for the fact that the selling didn't encounter the demand that ordinarily develops from the trade and chocolate manufacturers,&quot; one analyst said. She observed that while the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa grower, appeared to be pursuing a policy of cautious selling so as not to depress prices, traders questioned how long that country could remain out of the market. Fine growing weather prevails in Brazil and the Ivory Coast, which implies a further swelling of world stocks when this crop is harvested.    COTTON: Future prices declined on anticipation that rains next week will relieve the drought in the growing areas. July delivery cotton declined 0.99 cent a pound to 67.92 cents, and new-crop December dropped 1.62 cents to 64.95 cents. One analyst said that the National Weather Service in its five-day to l0-day forecast predicted showers over the Mississippi Delta region early next week. The rains aren't expected to be heavy, the analyst said, and rainfall would still be below normal, but the predicted moisture is expected to help relieve dry conditions. </TEXT></DOC>
