Hoover decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book ofretailing.   By 1982, armed with an economics degree and experience as a WallStreet analyst and department store executive, he was ready tostart writing.   Hoover, then 31, opened his first Bookstop store in the Texascapital, modeling it loosely on the successful Toys R Us design _big selection and discount prices. A book ``superstore,'' he calledit.   Six years later, the Bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores _with three more scheduled to open by year's end _ in Texas, Floridaand Louisiana. And the Bookstop founder and chairman saysconfidently that there will be more to the story.   ``I decided when I was, like 13 years old, that someday I wasgoing to start a chain of stores. Everything I've done since thenwas toward that goal,'' he said.   But if your idea of a bookstore is a small, musty, dark-paneledplace awash in pipe smoke, Bookstop stores might come as a shock.   The company says its average store covers 9,500 square feet andstocks 35,000 titles in 300 subject areas.   Hoover is an architecture buff, and the stores have moved intosome unusual sites, including Houston's art-deco Alabama movietheater. The store being opened in New Orleans will be located in a100-year-old cotton warehouse.   ``We've got the flexibility to do those things _ old cafeterias,old roller-skating rinks, old theaters,'' he said. ``I'd love to bein an old bank, too.''   Bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more, some closing only twodays a year. They offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles, 25percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers whoannually purchase ``Readers Choice'' cards. The company counts morethan 200,000 cardholders.   Bookstop has centralized distribution, so books arriving at theAustin headquarters from publishers can be inventoried, labeledwith the chain's own price tags and shipped to stores. The storestransmit their sales results nightly by computer, making themavailable the next morning so Bookstop's four buyers can see what'sselling.   ``With a superstore like ours, to break even, our annual salesvolume's got to be three, four times the sales of the averagebookstore. It's a much harder thing to do, to carry that big aselection. We need an advanced computer system, real sophisticatedinventory control systems, and yet we try to do it all at adiscount,'' Hoover said, adding that Bookstop moved 4.5 millionvolumes through its distribution center last year.   ``Retailing's always been an intensely competitive business. Butit's becoming a much more technological business. Our survivaldepends much more on research, on understanding the customer, oncomputerized controls,'' he said.   The privately held company doesn't make public sales figures,although Hoover has said in the past that 1986 sales were $26million. In 1985, the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days.   The company's founder got his start with an economics degreefrom the University of Chicago. He was a retailing analyst withCitibank in New York and worked for department store companies inDallas and St. Louis. He says he spent seven years working on hisBookstop business plan before raising the money to open the firststore.   Hoover readily credits the Toys R Us stores with the concept. Hevoices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be amongretailing's big winners between now and the end of the century. Hecites such companies as Drug Emporium Inc., Sound Warehouse, andnew superstores in office supplies and sporting goods.   ``Books is one of the fastest-growing categories of retailing... That demand ties to the baby boom, because baby boomers aregetting richer every day, their incomes are rising as a group, andthey're really oriented toward buying books, continuingself-education, and now buying their children books,'' Hoover said.   Although other bookstore chains already were major nationalforces, Hoover said he didn't encounter too much skepticism when heapproached investors with his idea of another.   ``Books have survived the introduction of radio, theintroduction of television, the introduction of phonograph recordsand movies. Books are a way of transmitting information, andcompared with other ways of transmitting information, they arestill cheap, portable, compact and readily available. We're tryingto do our part to make them more readily available,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Sept. 5</NOTE></DOC>
