LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students hurling firebombs and rocksattacked a U.S. diplomatic office Monday as thousands ofdemonstrators battled riot police for a sixth consecutive day inthe southern city of Kwangju.   The attack did not damage the single-story U.S. InformationService building.   Police said they fired tear gas to thwart the attack by bands ofstudents shouting anti-U.S. slogans and hurling firebombs at thebuilding in the provincial city 165 miles south of Seoul.   At least four policemen were reported injured.   The Korean news agency Yonhap said police arrested twoprotesters who scaled the roof of an annex to the USIS building andtossed five firebombs that smashed several rooftiles, but caused nofire.   A student was seen unfolding an anti-U.S. placard at the top ofa nearby building, while another 100 students surged out ofsidestreets to hurl rocks and about 30 firebombs that explodedaround the gate and walls of the USIS office.   Also on Monday, groups of students attacked four police stationsin Kwangju, smashing windows and doors before being driven off.Clashes between police and some 1,000 protesters also broke out indowntown Kwangju after dark, the agency said.   The firebomb attack followed demonstrations Monday at Kwangju'sChonnam University, where police fired barrages of tear gas to stopabout 3,000 students and dissidents trying to march off campus.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Drive out theYankees!'' the demonstrators shouted as they called for a fullinvestigation into the South Korean army's bloody suppression of a1980 uprising in Kwangju in which about 200 people were killed.   Thousands of demonstrators have clashed with police in Kwangjusince rallies began Wednesday marking the eighth anniversary of theuprising.   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been running high in the recent wave ofprotests, with students demanding the removal of all U.S. influence.   The U.S. government has denied any involvement in the Kwangjuincident, but dissidents contend the United States condoned themovement of South Korean soldiers to suppress the protests. Under amutual defense pact, the United States controls both Korean troopsand 42,000 U.S. soldiers stationed here.   Last week, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at theUSIS building in Seoul and hurled home made bombs at the U.S.Embassy. A policeman and two students were hurt in the incident.   But other parts of South Korea were reported quiet Monday afterfive days of anti-government demonstrations that often turned intoviolent clashes with riot police in the streets and on campuses.</TEXT></DOC>
