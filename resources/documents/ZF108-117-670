said Denis Vohs,chairman and chief executive officer of Ross Systems, a $30 million financialand accounting software company based in Palo Alto, Calif.andP;  &quot;Companies thatbuild portable software use the lowest common denominator and don't take fulladvantage of DEC systems.&quot;andM;Regardless of performance, a more fundamental problem for traditional VMSsoftware vendors is that many are too small to be viewed by the typicalFortune 500 customer as viable software suppliers.andM;DEC officials apparently recognize that many of DEC's software partners arenot perceived as large enough to support the needs of a Fortune 500 company,and that this could be the Achilles' heel of its mainframe program.andP;  Inresponse, DEC has focused on attracting suppliers of IBM mainframe softwareto the VAX platform.andM;DEC officials maintained that while the company is supporting its softwarepartners adequately, it also must follow market realities.andM;Michael Carabetta, DEC's group marketing manager of finance andadministtrative business systems, said DEC provides sales leads to itsvendors and has them participate in corporate leader forums.andP;  However, hesaid, the success of many of these companies in the Fortune 500 market willbe based on simple economics.andM;Carabetta also said DEC's decision to encourage porting of IBM products toDEC platforms has been fueled by customers who have mainframes and who wantsoftware that doesn't require their staffs to undergo a great deal ofretraining.andM;&quot;Although we have a tremendous allegiance to our partners, we also have atremendous allegiance to our customers,&quot; he said.andM;Brian Owen, senior director of the DEC products division at $500 millionBelmont, Calif.-based Oracle, said, &quot;Would you bet your job and yourcompany's future that a smaller company will meet your needs today and in thefuture?andP;  It's difficult for a $10 million, $20 million or $30 million companyto make the investment needed to supply products today and guarantee them inthe future.andM;OWen added, &quot;It used to be hardware [that] you bet your future on.andP;  Todayit's software.andP;  The solutions you want are [determining] the hardware youbuy.&quot;andM;But traditional VMS software developers argue that DEC could do a lot more topush VMS-only applications in Fortune 500 accounts.andP;  Many executives at largecorporations will not consider small suppliers, suspecting they lack thefinancing to provide long-term customer support and research and development.andM;To combat this perception, some independent software vendors suggest that DECtake its cue from IBM and invest directly in ISVs that develop software forDEC-only platforms.andP;  The vendors contend that such action on DEC's part wouldallay the fears of Fortune 500 executives while promoting the development ofsoftware optimized for VMS environments.andM;DEC's investment would give the companies DEC's &quot;stamp of approval,&quot; RossSystems' Vohs said.andM;Besides direct investment, ISVs say, DEC can help cultivate software vendorsby giving ISVs a commission if the sale of their product results in the saleof DEC hardware.andP;  Hewlett-Packard has such a program, and DEC already pays 5percent to 6 percent commissions for such transactions in Europe.andM;DEC broadens ISV baseandM;DEC has, as a matter of fact, begun a campaign of expand its marketingrelationships with ISVs.andM;Last month the company signed a pact with Cognos, an Ottawa-based 4GLdeveloper, under which DEC's sales force will market the Cognos PowerHouse4GL directly.andP;  It is expected that DEC will sign a number of similar pactsover the coming months.andP;  By doing so, DEC may quiet criticism that it has notdone as much as it could to support its software partners.andM;John Logan, executive vice president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston-basedmarket research and consulting company, said although DEC's ISV programexcels in technical assistance, DEC does not adequately follow through once aproduct is developed.andM;&quot;IBM helps its vendors very well with marketing their products.andP;  It sets upvideo presentations, it helps them with their marketing literature,&quot; Logansaid.andP;  &quot;It's just a shame that a company as technically sound as DEC does notstand behind products in a marketing and business sense.&quot;andM;Last fall in a report to Aberdeen clients, Logan wrote, &quot;While Digital's ISVprogram can accommodate [an independent software manufacturer's] technicalneeds, ISVs must fend for themselves in gaining customer attention.&quot;andM;Although DEC has not granted every wish on Ross Systems' list, Vohs creditedhis company's close relationship with DEC as being largely responsible forRoss' growth from a $17 million company in June 1988 to its present size.andP;  Inaddition, he said DEC sales leads could help make Ross a $100 million companyby 1993.andM;But Vohs said his is one of the luckier companies--and he's not sure the luckwill hold in the Fortune 500 market.andP;  &quot;One of the problems ...andP;  is that some[software] companies are so small, nobody knows of them,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
