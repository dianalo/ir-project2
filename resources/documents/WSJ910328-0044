About C$300 million of the planned spending is earmarkedfor Shell's natural gas plant in Caroline, Alberta, thecompany said, with another C$100 million being used toacquire Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s 8% stake in the project.</LP><TEXT>   Shell has already begun construction of a C$950 millionplant to process production from the massive Caroline &quot;sour&quot;gas field, about 60 miles north of Calgary. That project,which would be financed over three years, would develop thefield, which is estimated to have reserves of about twotrillion cubic feet of sour gas, so called because of itshigh hydrogen-sulphide content.   &quot;A lot of this capital spending is going on projects thatwill start to generate significant earnings in a few years,&quot;said Wilfred Gobert, an analyst at Calgary-based Peters andamp; Co.   Shell said it has allocated C$200 million to other naturalgas development projects, C$20 million to frontierexploration programs and C$50 million to enhanced oilrecovery projects in 1991.   In 1990, Shell spent C$555 million on capital projects.   A Shell spokesman said the company will finance thisyear's spending from its cash flow, usually about C$700million a year, and the proceeds of a $300 million debtoffering in the U.S., completed early in the first quarter.The spokesman said that the company also expects additionalcash to become available as its working capital requirementsdrop along with the price of oil. The company buyssignificantly more oil than it produces in order to fill itseastern Canadian refineries.   Shell Canada said it allocated C$270 million of the 1991capital spending budgets to improvements to its refining andmarketing operations, a level of spending that surprised someanalysts.   Jim Doak, an analyst with Toronto-based First Marathon,said that while the company's earnings could increase by asmuch as C$1 a share when the Caroline plant comes on streamin 1993, its downstream operations have been much lessprofitable and returns on investment in that sector arelikely to be smaller and slower in coming.   Shell Canada said it expects its capital spending over thenext four years to total about C$3.6 billion, with C$1.9billion going to natural gas exploration and development andC$1.2 to its downstream oil refining and marketing division.The company's spokesman said Shell expects to be able tofinance that spending from cash flow without having to raiseadditional funds through debt or equity issues. He said thebond issue earlier this year raised Shell Canada's long-termdebt to about C$1.3 billion, from C$1.04 billion at year end.   In 1990, Shell reported net income of C$312 million, orC$2.78 a share, up from C$212 million, or C$1.89 million ashare, in 1989. The company said it expects to report netincome for 1991 that is closer to the 1989 level, assuming aneconomic recovery in the second half of 1991 and oil pricesof $20 to $25 a barrel.   Shell Canada is 78%-controlled by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,an Anglo-Dutch concern. In trading on the Toronto StockExchange yesterday, Shell Canada shares closed at C$40.75, up75 Canadian cents.</TEXT></DOC>
