The assessment provides a basis for the conclusionthat the field testing of these genetically engineered tomato plants doesnot present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and alsowill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at the Biotechnologyand Environmental Coordination Staff, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 406, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. James L.

The rule regulatesthe introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into theenvironment) of genetically engineered organisms and products which areplant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulatedarticles). The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for therelease into the environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limitedpermits for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can be introducedin the United States.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Monsanto Agricultural Company of St. Louis, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tomato plants that are designed to be tolerant to the herbicideglyphosate. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tomato plants under theconditions described in the Monsanto application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by the Monsanto Agricultural Company, as wellas a review of other relevant literature, provides the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene for herbicide tolerance has been inserted into a tomato chromosome.In nature, chromosomal genetic material can only be transferred to othersexually compatible plants by cross-pollination. In this field test, theintroduced genes cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollination becausethe field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexuallycompatible plants with which the engineered plants might cross-pollinate.2. Neither the herbicide tolerance gene itself, nor its gene product conferson tomato any plant pest characteristics.3. The plant from which the herbicide tolerance gene was isolated is nota plant pest.4. The herbicide tolerance gene does not provide the transformed tomatoplants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomatoin the ability to be disseminated or to become established in the environment.5. The vector used to transfer the herbicide tolerance gene to tomato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease has beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto susceptible plants.6. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and the herbicide tolerance gene into the plant cells, has been shownto be eliminated and no longer associated with the transformed tomato plants.7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering and inserting the gene into the plant genome (i.e.,chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survive in the transformed plants.No horizontal movement mechanism is known to exist in nature to move aninserted gene from a chromosome of a transformed plant to any other organism.8. Glyphosate is one of the new herbicides that is rapidly degraded inthe environment. It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than manyherbicides commonly used.9. The size of the field test plot is very small (70 feet wide by 320 feetlong) and is physically isolated from many species of wild plants and animalsby a surrounding area of cultivated land. The environmental assessmentand finding of no significant impact has been prepared in accordance with(1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321<T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 31st day of May, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
