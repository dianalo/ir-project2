The ruling, handed down by Judge Stephen Reasoner,contradicts a ruling last month by a federal judge in SantaFe, N.M., and is sure to be appealed by the RTC.</LP><TEXT>   The RTC claims that it has the right, under a regulationthat became effective June 1, to ignore certain state laws,including those restricting banks' abilities to operatebranches. Arkansas, New Mexico and 10 other states imposevarying branch restrictions.   But Judge Reasoner decided that the RTC overstepped itsauthority in adopting the override regulation and declared it&quot;unlawful, null and void.&quot;   &quot;There is no doubt that the RTC can more effectively carryout its mandate (to sell thrifts) if it is allowed tooverride state law and receive better bids from purchasers,&quot;Judge Reasoner wrote. &quot;Congress, had it so intended, couldhave given such authority to the RTC.&quot;   Because the judge declared the RTC override regulationnull, the ruling may apply to thrift sales in states otherthan Arkansas, said Leonard Rosen, an attorney for theArkansas State Bank Department and the Arkansas IndependentBankers Association. &quot;The judge did not say just Arkansas,&quot;said Mr. Rosen, who is with the law firm of Bracewell andamp;Patterson in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Rosen had filed suit on behalf of the Arkansas StateBank Department to block the sale of an insolvent Arkansasthrift and its 20 branches to a unit of Worthen Banking Corp.   Some of the thrift's branches are outside Worthen's homecounty, and operating those branches would have put Worthenin violation of Arkansas state law. Worthen Chairman CurtBradbury said the bank holding company will now reconsiderthe acquisition of the thrift, Independence Federal Bank,which has $172 million in assets.   RTC spokesmen didn't respond to the Arkansas ruling, butan appeal is expected in light of the contrary ruling issuedlast month by federal Judge Santiago Campos of Santa Fe.   Judge Campos ruled in favor of the RTC and permitted thesale of a New Mexico thrift and its out-of-county branches toa New Mexico bank. An appeal of that ruling is pending inDenver.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          LEONARD RUBIN of the law firm of Bracewell andamp; Patterson inWashington, D.C., represented the Arkansas IndependentBankers Association in a suit against the Resolution TrustCorp.
