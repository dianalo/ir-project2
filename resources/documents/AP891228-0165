(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons arebeing absorbed by the soil and oceans, according to scientists whosay they still don't know where exactly the chemicals are going orwhat the process means.   Researchers Aslam Khalil and Reinhold Rasmussen were studyingAustralian termite mounds to see how they dumped the gas methaneinto the atmosphere when their measurements indicated that the soilwas absorbing CFCs.   ``And it's not confined to Australian termite mounds. We lookedat areas of Brazil and found it. We also found it in Chinese ricefields,'' said Khalil, a physicist at the Oregon Graduate Instituteof Science and Technology.   The process may have only a minor effect on the atmosphere, butto Khalil it suggests that CFCs' interaction with the environmentis more complex than has been thought. ``I don't think, on a globalscale, this will be significant, but compare the greenhouse gases.They have only a minute effect by themselves. What's important istheir additive effect.''   Two other atmospheric scientists, F. Sherwood Roland of theUniversity of California, Irvine, and Mario Molina of MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, agree the mechanism of chlorofluorocarbonabsorption by the soil may be worth studying, but that the effecton the atmosphere is minimal.   ``It's not a process that's materially shortening thechlorofluorocarbon lifetime in the atmosphere,'' Roland said.``It's not a major sink.''   The ocean appears to be merely storing the CFCs, the scientistssaid. ``CFCs are permanently lost in atmospheric processes but inthe ocean that's not so, it's just dissolving,'' said Khalil.   The oceans' capacity is huge, so it's possible ``they will buildup over a very long time scale, on the order of thousands ofyears,'' Roland said. ``But only about 1 percent of all CFCs are inthe ocean now, which again doesn't change the overall calculationvery much.''   A much more serious concern is the amount of chlorofluorocarbonsstored in polyurethane insulation, vehicle air conditioning unitsand home refrigerators, the scientists say.   ``The ban on CFCs in aerosol sprays merely put them intopolyurethane insulating foam, just being stored for futurerelease,'' Khalil said. ``That's more alarming than soil uptake,which at best is good, at worst is nothing.''   Chlorofluorocarbons were widely used in aerosol propellantsuntil evidence mounted they were contributing to the depletion ofthe Earth's protective ozone layer, which shields the planet fromharmful ultraviolet radiation.   In May, representatives of 81 nations met in Helsinki and calledfor the elimination of CFC use by the year 2000. Their declarationseeks to toughen the provisions of a 1987 ozone-protection treatycalled the Montreal Protocol.   ``About 85 percent of the CFCs manufactured already have beenreleased into the atmosphere,'' Roland said. ``For aerosolpropellants it's about a six-month lag time. For automobile airconditioners, it's about two to three years. For home refrigeratorsit may be 20 years.   ``What that means is that we'll reach the maximum concentrationof CFCs in the atmosphere about five to 10 years aftermanufacturing stops.''   Khalil said, ``In a way, it's not bad that CFCs are tied upsomewhere, so their release is slow and won't bother anybody. It'sbetter than going into the air in large quantities.''   Greenhouse gases that could contribute to global warming, suchas methane, are a far more serious threat, he, Roland and Molinasaid.   ``You can ban CFC production in the narrow, highlyindustrialized band of cities in the Northern Hemisphere,'' Khalilsaid, ``but you can't ban methane or carbon dioxide. You can't tellbacteria to stop making it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 1</NOTE></DOC>
