<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0941 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dongpu depression is an area with very rich natural gas resources. Sofar, three different originated gases have been found, i.e. coal gas,oil associated gas and mixture of both. High deposition rate of LowerTertiary caused the secondary gas generation process of the underlaincoal bed systems within the Carboniferous-Permian sequences and alsocaused overmaturity of many oil source beds in Lower Tertiary and becamegas prone, therefore abundant gas sources are available in the depression.Intense faulting and subsiding activities have caused the regional tectonicpattern with deep sags parallel with high lifted uplifts and also variousstructures and structure trends. The frequency changing of the lithologiccharacteristics may form various stratigraphic traps. In Dongpu depressionarea, there are numerous gas reservoir horizons vertically existed onstratigraphic section but they are relative concentrated within a particularstratigraphic interval. The main gas bearing zones are mainly those deeperformations underlain beneath the formation of Sha{sup 2}{sub 3}. Thegas rich accumulations are laterally formed in those structures situatedat the sagging and periphery part of the depression. This was interpretedby the fact that gas generation is strongly intensified at the centralpart of the depression and the gas trapping mechanisms are provided bylithologic lateral changing and faulting seals.</TEXT></DOC>
