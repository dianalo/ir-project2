Carlucci today beganhis first trip to China, a five-day visit expected to includediscussions on U.S. concerns about Chinese arms sales in the MiddleEast   Carlucci is to hold talks on global, regional and bilateralissues with his host, National Defense Minister Qin Qiwei. He isalso scheduled to meet China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping, andCommunist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.   He spent two days in Guam before flying to Beijing, where he wasmet at the airport by Gen. Sung Wenzhong, head of the bureau offoreign affairs in the People's Liberation Army.   Carlucci is expected to restate U.S. concerns about China's armssales to the Middle East, which Washington says could destabilizemilitary balances in that volatile region.   China has reportedly sold Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iranand recently agreed to supply Saudi Arabia with medium-rangesurface-to-surface missiles. U.S. officials say China is alsotrying to sell to Syria a shorter-range missile now underdevelopment.   China, which denies selling Silkworms to Iran, is building upits arms industry to help finance the modernization of its ownarmed forces.   When Secretary of State George P. Shultz brought up the issue ofMiddle East sales during a visit in July, the Chinese said theweapons were of a defensive nature and the sales carried out in aresponsible manner.   Chinese officials are, in turn, likely to urge Washington toease restrictions on sales of high technology items to China.   The Chinese say U.S. businessmen are losing business to Japaneseand European competitors because the Pentagon is reluctant to allowtransfer of some types of technology.   In particular, China is expected to urge the Reaganadministration to give the go-ahead for U.S. companies to useChinese Long March rockets to launch satellites.   Reagan is to make a decision on the Chinese launches later thismonth. The State Department has recommended that Reagan grantexport licenses for the satellites, but the Commerce Department hasobjected, saying that would undercut U.S. companies trying todevelop satellite launching services.   Carlucci's visit is the third by a Pentagon chief during theReagan administration, following visits by former Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger in 1983 and 1986.   Visits and personnel exchanges between the militaries of the twocountries have become common, and U.S. military sales to China havegrown at a steady if modest pace.   The United States has supplied China with transport helicoptersand avionics equipment for Chinese fighter planes, and Boeing isnow holding negotiations on possible sales of about a dozen CH-47helicopters for use in a Chinese rapid deployment force.   Carlucci is also to travel to the ancient capital of Xian andstop in Shanghai, where he will tour a Chinese naval facility.</TEXT></DOC>
