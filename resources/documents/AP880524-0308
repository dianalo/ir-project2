Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent ofTexaco's stock, has threatened a shareholder fight to elect hisassociates to the board at the company's annual meeting next month.   Icahn has stated previously that Texaco, the nation's No. 3 oilcompany is worth more to shareholders broken up and sold. Themanagement has pledged to sell at least $5 billion worth of assetsas part of a profound restructuring plan. The two sides have beenintensely negotiating for the past few weeks.   Texaco said late Tuesday that to help further discussions, itand Icahn had agreed to a mechanism under which the annual meetingcould be postponed from June 7 to June 17. Both sides hadpreviously agreed to postpone the meeting to June 14 if necessaryso the new arrangement gave them three additional days.   A receptionist at Icahn's New York office said he was out of theoffice and unreachable for comment.   Sources familiar with the Texaco-Icahn negotiations, who spokeon the condition they not be identified, said the option to furtherdelay the annual meeting did not necessarily mean there was anysignificant movement in the position of either side. There had beenspeculation an agreement was near.   ``It signifies that each side would like to stop the clock fromticking and have three free days without the encumbrance of time,''said one source.   Texaco shares, which have been falling since the truce talksbegan, declined $1.50 Tuesday to $46.12{ in heavy volume in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   The Icahn negotiations are the latest chapter in Texaco's effortto function normally following a protracted legal battle withPennzoil Co., which left Texaco mired in bankruptcy court fornearly a year.</TEXT></DOC>
