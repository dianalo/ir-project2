The findings could have a significant impact on treatmentof strokes, which kill about 150,000 people in the U.S. eachyear, and on use of the controversial procedure in whichsurgeons ream out the carotid artery to improve blood flow.</LP><TEXT>   The carotid artery is one of two major arteries thatsupply blood to the brain, and a blockage resulting from abuildup of plaque along the vessel's walls is a common causeof strokes. Nearly 100,000 reaming procedures, called carotidendarterectomies, are done each year in the U.S. They areusually performed after a mild stroke, called a transientischemic attack, reveals the presence of blockage.   But the surgery carries a high risk. Some studies havefound that one patient in 10 either dies or suffers a strokeas a result of the operation, and others have questioned itseffectiveness in any event in reducing stroke. Indeed,researchers at Rand Corp., the Santa Monica, Calif., thinktank, concluded a few years ago that about one-third of suchprocedures in the U.S. are unnecessary and another third arequestionable.   The current study, published in this week's Lancet, theU.K. medical journal, found that the operation has a sixfoldreduction in the rate of stroke for patients whose carotidarteries were at least 70% obstructed. Strokes that causedsevere disability or death were reduced eightfold. But forpeople with blockage under 30%, the risks of the surgeryoutweigh any benefits.   Results for the 50% of patients whose arteries weremoderately blocked aren't conclusive, the report says.   The study, known as the European Carotid Surgery Trial andconducted at medical centers in 12 countries, is an unusualexperiment in that patients were randomly assigned to eithersurgery or nonsurgical treatment after an initial examinationindicated a blockage. The findings are based on comparison ofoutcomes of the surgical and nonsurgical groups. A similarstudy of the operation is under way in the U.S. and Canada.In February, researchers said initial findings indicated theprocedure is effective in patients with severe blockages.   Patients were entered into the study only if they werewilling to consider surgery, and only if their doctors were&quot;substantially uncertain&quot; whether surgery was the propercourse of treatment. The findings are based on about 2,200patients among 2,518 who have been involved in the studysince 1981. The average patient was about 60 years old; about70% were men.   The researchers found that 7.5% of the 778 patients withsevere blockage died or suffered a serious stroke within 30days of surgery. Over the next three years, another 2.8% ofthose patients died or had serious strokes. Of those whodidn't have surgery, nearly 17% died or had severe strokes.Among patients with mild blockages, 16% of patients suffereda serious or fatal stroke within three years after surgery,compared with 7% who didn't have surgery.   For patients with mild blockages, an editorialaccompanying the study said that &quot;any benefits of surgery areoutweighed by the risks,&quot; and that &quot;endarterectomy istherefore not recommended as first-line treatment in thesepatients, who should be treated with aspirin.&quot;   Such random trials are commonly used to compare drugsagainst dummy placebo pills or other treatments, but are rarefor surgery, in part because of ethical questions raised byasking patients to risk surgery they may not need or to riskmissing surgery that may save their lives.   Medical researchers nevertheless are stepping up effortsto compare the effectiveness of surgery against otherpossible treatments in efforts to eliminate unnecessaryprocedures that both put patients at risk and waste money.Surgery for prostate disease, cataracts, back pain and hipreplacement are among procedures currently under intensivestudy in the U.S. -- though with methods other than randomsurgery trials.</TEXT></DOC>
