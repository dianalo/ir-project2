The recommendation will go to the secretary of the state Department of Business Regulation, who will make a final ruling.    As reported, the state had asked Southland, owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, to prove before an administrative hearing officer that none of its current officers were involved in matters leading to the conviction.    Florida law prohibits convicted felons from holding beer and wine licenses, but makes exceptions if the offenders aren't with the company any longer.    John H. Rodgers, Southland's general counsel, said the hearing officer agreed with Southland that none of its executives were involved in an alleged bribery scheme that led to the conviction. But the hearing officer recommended that the company pay a $500-a-store fine because of the conviction. The company sells about $90 million in beer and wine annually in Florida.    Last week, members of the Thompson family, the company's founding family, offered to take the Southland private in a leveraged buyout valued at about $4 billion, or about $77 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
