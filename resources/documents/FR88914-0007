Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAR), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as withother Department of Commerce rules, comments from the public are alwayswelcome. Written comments (six copies) should be submitted to: Joan Maguire,Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule mentions collections of information that are subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0625-0001.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 399</ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Part 399 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFRParts 368-399) is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 399_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
