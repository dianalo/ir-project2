Broadbandelectrostatic noise and low-frequency electromagnetic bursts are detectedin the plasma sheet boundary layer, especially in the presence of strongion flows, currents, and steep spacial gradients in the fluxes of few-keVelectrons and ions. Particle simulations have been performed to investigateelectrostatic turbulence driven by a cold electron beam and/or ion beamswith a bean-shaped velocity distribution. The simulation results showthat the counterstreaming ion beams as well as the counterstreaming ofthe cold electron beam and the ion beam excite ion acoustic waves withthe Doppler-shifted real frequency {omega}{approx_equal} +- k/sub parallel/(c/subs/-V/sub i//sub //sub parallel/). However, the effect of the bean-shapedion velocity distributions reduces the growth rates of ion acoustic instability.The simulation results also show that the slowing down of the ion beamis larger at the larger perpendicular velocity. The wave spectra of theelectric fields at some points for simulations show turbulence generatedby growing waves. The frequency of these spectra ranges from {Omega}/subi/ to {omega}/sub p//sub e/, which is in qualitative agreement with thesatellite data. copyright American Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
