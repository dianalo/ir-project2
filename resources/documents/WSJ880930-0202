Feet swell. Derrieres turn numb. Skin itches and eyes sting in the dry cabin air. Boredom grows thick and patience wears thin. Overeating and too many cocktails add to the discomfort.    Even worse: Flying isn't likely to get better. Design innovations that could relieve passenger distress often are used instead to squeeze a few extra passengers into planes. In a competitive industry, airlines worry more about their bottom lines than about their customers' bottoms.    &quot;From the passenger point of view, not a lot can change,&quot; says Don Bennett, Boeing Co.'s director of marketing management and production development for the 747 and 767. &quot;Ultimately, we and the airlines are constrained by the economics. Any feature we or an airline add must earn its way onto the airplane.&quot;    Nowadays, many flights last 10, 12 or even 14 hours. Airplane builders and airlines know this is a lot to bear, especially in economy class. It can even be unhealthy: A recent article in the British medical journal Lancet warned that cramped seating and dehydration caused by alcoholic drinks increase travelers' risk of developing potentially dangerous blood clots in their legs. It called the problem Economy Class Syndrome.    &quot;Where does the poor Joe fit in?&quot; asks Stuart Iddles, a senior vice president for Airbus Industrie. &quot;Will he feel comfortable for 14 hours?&quot; In improving passenger comfort, &quot;we're not doing enough, any of us,&quot; he acknowledges. (Planes are usually purchased with interior paneling, overhead bins, ventilation and lighting already in place. But it is the airlines that choose seats, galleys and toilets.)    There have been some technological advances in cabin furnishings and design, of course. Seats are lighter. Cabin materials are flame-retardant. Galleys can dispense decent hot meals. Audio headsets are being designed for better comfort and sound.    But airlines themselves have been the bigger beneficiaries. Take seats. Through sculpting, engineering and new materials, seat manufacturers have managed to make chairs that give more leg-room because seatbacks are molded away from the knees. But airlines have used the design improvements to stuff more seats on board and thus make more money, says Mr. Bennett of Boeing.    Efforts to improve on-board bedding are aimed not at passengers but at pilots and cabin staff, who are supposed to get a chance to rest after working a certain number of hours. Thus, Airbus's proposed cargo sleepers -- ordinary metal freight containers outfitted with beds that would ride in the belly of the plane -- are being studied by carriers such as Lufthansa German Airlines, but only for its crew. Likewise, McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s experiments with beds in overhead luggage bins are for crews' benefit.    Toilets and galleys that can be moved within the plane to change cabin layout also are being sold as an advantage -- to the carriers. They allow airlines to shift quickly from an all-economy layout for a tourist route to a three-class configuration when a plane is put on the New York run. What does this have to do with the traveler who's wedged into a middle seat in economy next to a screaming baby halfway over the Pacific? Not much.    To be fair, most airlines want to design comfortable cabins, if only to win business.    Swissair recently let its fliers evaluate 46 makes of seats under consideration for 12 new MD-11 jetliners it has ordered. Some carriers make the middle seat in a row slightly wider to reduce elbow-to-elbow claustrophobia.    Aircraft interior designers are always trying out ideas. Most aren't feasible. One &quot;neat idea&quot; that didn't make it, according to Mr. Bennett of Boeing, was luggage bins set into the floor. They were judged too hard to clean, he says.    Jerry W. Newkirk, manager of interior design for McDonnell Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, says his &quot;pet idea&quot; is to create self-contained cabins that would slide into the airplane through its hinged nose. Passengers could board their cabin, get their drink and be whisked onto the plane. Reinder van Duinen, a board member of Dutch aircraft maker NV Fokker, imagines a hypersonic capsule whisking half a dozen people from London to Australia in 30 minutes -- and dropping them off at their homes or offices.    Most thinking about cabin design and airline amenities tends to be much more mundane than Mr. van Duinen's futuristic fantasizing. For example, folks in the business-class and first-class seats someday may enjoy private business centers with facsimile machines, personal computers and copiers. One day, they may even get individual video screens or laptop computers. But plane builders caution that this technology is a long way off.    The new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 probably will be available with a passenger cabin in the cargo hold for business-class travelers. Called the Panorama Deck for its downward slanting windows, the compartment would have separate emergency doors, toilets and a galley for 44 to 65 passengers. It could even store some first-class sleeping berths, says Mr. Newkirk. But that would require two spaces for the passenger, a seat and a berth, and that's expensive, he says.    Airbus, which came up with the notion of beds in cargo containers on its new A-340 jetliner, suggests that these special sleepers could find a market with rich people who would take them along on all their flights. But that idea seems far-fetched. Competitors point out that the containers would take up revenue-producing cargo space and that building a door to the cargo hold could pose decompression problems for the main cabin.    Until supersonic transport is a reality, there are &quot;no breakthroughs&quot; in sight for cabin design, says Mr. Bennett of Boeing. Economy Class Syndrome would seem to be here to stay. </TEXT></DOC>
