Licensed by Computer Giant </HL><SO> </SO><CO> IBM ADBE </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp., as expected, said it has licensed some of the software inside the computer Steven Jobs's new company Next Inc. unveiled yesterday.    IBM hopes the Next software will make it easier to program and use IBM technical workstations. That is a market in which the Armonk, N.Y. computer giant has lagged, but is planning a big push to gain new ground.    Like Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer, the Next software lets a user execute complex commands by pointing to visual symbols on a screen. IBM said it also licensed software by two other companies whose programs are used in the Next system: Adobe Systems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., and closely held Stepstone Corp. of Sandy Hook, Conn. </TEXT></DOC>
