In a study of 1,109 major and minor league baseballplayers, health researchers found that nearly half offrequent users of smokeless tobacco developed white,callus-type sores on their gums. Such players were also morelikely than those who didn't use the smokeless tobacco tohave other gum problems that could ultimately lead to loss ofteeth later in life.</LP><TEXT>   The study, published in today's Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, adds to growing concern about the healtheffects of smokeless tobacco -- including chewing tobacco andsnuff -- and increasing use of the products by children.   &quot;The players know in general that it has bad healtheffects,&quot; says Deborah G. Grady, assistant professor ofepidemiology and medicine at the University of California atSan Francisco, and a co-author of the study. &quot;A lot of youngboys emulate them and they're concerned about that.&quot;   About 75% of the players in the study used snuff; otherplayers used a coarser wad of chewing tobacco.   The researchers didn't uncover any evidence of canceramong the players, most of whom were between 20 and 29 yearsold. But other studies have linked long-term use of snuff inparticular with oral cancer, Dr. Grady says.</TEXT></DOC>
