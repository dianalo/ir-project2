The service is limited tointrastate highspeed, digital private-line service and otherservices dedicated to a particular customer. It doesn'tencompass interstate or switched service.   Teleport, a unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., had petitionedIllinois regulators in December to require Illinois Bell toprovide connections to its network. The companies then begannegotiating to resolve the matter.
