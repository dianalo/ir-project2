Armed with a psychology degree fromNew York's City College, he began as a full-time counselor ina home for boys, switched into the flower business (&quot;to feedthe family&quot;) and now has taken on the additional job ofraising funds for a home for retarded adults.   A native of New York's Queens County, Mr. McCann's publicservice started at St. John's Home for Boys in RockawayBeach. In 1976, with a new family to support (he now hasthree children), he looked for a business he could handle. &quot;Icome from an entrepreneurial family,&quot; he says. He hit uponflowers because he could start out part time and with aminimum of capital. &quot;There were no majors in the flowerbusiness,&quot; he says, &quot;like McDonald's in hamburgers.&quot;   Starting with one shop in Manhattan, he built what is nowthe 12-store Flora Plenty chain, with annual volume of $10million. In 1986, he bought control of a then-money-losingflowers-by-phone company whose major asset was an 800telephone number that spelled f-l-o-w-e-r-s. Grafting thatonto his Northeastern retail chain, he added $20 million ayear in volume.   Mr. McCann, however, had never lost his interest in socialservice. He still sits on the board of two homes forchildren, his original St. John's, and St. Joseph's, a homefor girls run by the Josephite Sisters, as well as on theboard of the Brooklyn Catholic Child Care Society. In 1987,he took on still another pro bono chore, helping the New HopeCommunity, a center for retarded adults located in theCatskills. Here he had a personal motive; his retardedbrother was in New Hope.   This nonprofit, nonsectarian Catskill community for theretarded sits in the heart of the borsch circuit. When Mr.McCann became interested in it, he brought not only hisentrepreneurial and fund-raising skills but ideas he hadacquired while working with the Marianist Brothers inRockaway. Like most such institutions, St. John's at firsthad housed its boys in dormitories. Most of its residents,however, had grown up in apartments; the communal dorm lifebecame an extra psychological problem. To overcome that, theMarianists decided to create a campus atmosphere, with adozen apartments, with each bedroom housing two boys. Thatway, nursing, schooling and other services could be providedin separate quarters. New Hope is organized along similarlines, with 10 group homes.   The campus milieu, Mr. McCann says, works as well for theadults in New Hope as it did for the boys in Rockaway. Allthe guests are mentally retarded, but Mr. McCann notes thatthis is not their only handicap. Some are blind, some inwheelchairs. The separate homes can offer facilities and aidtailored to the needs of each group.   Since he joined the New Hope operation, which takes a dayor more out of each working week, Mr. McCann's fund-raisingcommittee has raised $400,000 toward its $750,000 goal. Histarget for 1990 is $100,000, and he has about $40,000 of thatin hand. Additional funds to complete the Catskill &quot;campus&quot;will come from bonds issued by New York state's Office ofMental Retardation, money that Mr. McCann says willeventually be repaid out of New Hope's operating income.   Mr. McCann sees nothing remarkable in all this. &quot;I thinkthat your life, like diet or exercise, should be kept inbalance. My balance is my family, my business, and thiswork.&quot; His interest in New Hope, understandably, was sparkedby his brother, who he says was the catalyst for his originalchoice of social service as a career. &quot;It's simple,&quot; he says,&quot;I want to be involved.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
