In recent weeks, other administration officials have also backed away from President Reagan's call for a nonnuclear world, but Mr. Perle's is the strongest such statement to date.    Mr. Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, attributed the plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, not President Reagan. However, Mr. Reagan discussed the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals with Mr. Gorbachev at the Iceland summit last October. And afterward, President Reagan said that proposals discussed there could lead to a &quot;safer world without nuclear weapons,&quot; which the White House has characterized as an &quot;ultimate goal.&quot;    In taking a different stance, Mr. Perle will likely soothe the European allies, who were alarmed by the far-reaching proposals debated in Iceland. As many Europeans see it, the elimination of nuclear weapons would leave Western Europe vulnerable to attack by the Warsaw Pact's larger conventional forces.    Mr. Perle argued that the risk of Soviet cheating is too great for the U.S. ever to sign an agreement eliminating nuclear weapons. &quot;What western leader would turn in his country's last remaining nuclear weapons on the strength of assurances -- mere words -- that the Soviets had done the same?&quot; he asked.    Verifying Soviet compliance with such an agreement, he added, would be &quot;impossible.&quot;    Mr. Perle also voiced little confidence that the U.S. and its allies would be willing to pay to beef up their conventional forces sufficiently to reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons. &quot;To talk, in these circumstances, of the abandonment of nuclear weapons and the substitution of a conventional deterrent is absurd,&quot; he said.    Mr. Perle did argue for President Reagan's proposal to eliminate all intercontinental ballistic missiles. But rather than resulting in a nuclear-free world, that would lead to a &quot;reconfigured&quot; array of nuclear forces, Mr. Perle said. The resulting U.S. arsenal would consist of aircraft to deliver nuclear bombs, as well as low-flying cruise missiles launched from closer ranges than ballistic missiles. </TEXT></DOC>
