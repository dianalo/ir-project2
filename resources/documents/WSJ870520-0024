The suits, filed in county court, seek unspecified damages stemming from the crash of a Boeing 747 in which 520 passengers died and four survived.    Boeing and Japan Air Lines have admitted liability in the crash and have agreed to share the cost of claims arising from the incident, a lawyer for Boeing said. He said that Boeing isn't opposing the removal of Japan Air Lines as a defendant.    However, the Seattle-based aircraft maker and the Japanese carrier maintain that claims should be considered in Japanese courts rather than in the U.S.    Boeing's lawyer said the court hasn't ruled on the families' motion to dismiss the airline from the U.S. case, but added that he assumed the motion would be accepted, since it is unopposed. </TEXT></DOC>
