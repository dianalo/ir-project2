A unilateral Soviet withdrawal of that scale would have ``littleimpact strategically'' said a U.S official. But the politicalpayoff could be immense in Western Europe, where polls show greatenthusiasm for Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies.   U.S. officials trying to anticipate Gorbachev's summit strategyhave also detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summitmeeting before Reagan leaves office in eight months. The projectedsites are Vienna or Budapest.   Another summit would give the two sides more time to work on atreaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 to 50percent.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz acknowledged after makingfinal summit preparations last week in Geneva with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that ``it is now clear there is noway these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for thesummit'' in Moscow May 29-June 2.   The two sides, however, may use the Moscow summit to sign one``protocol'' of the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, aprovision under which each side would notify the other of the time,place and intended target of any planned missile tests, includingthose from submarines, said one U.S. official.   Because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit, U.S.officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said theyforesee it as an event to consolidate improvements in U.S.-Sovietrelations since Gorbachev took office in 1985 and began the summitmeetings.   At the same time, U.S. officials were preparing for possiblesurprises.   At Reykjavik in 1986, Gorbachev seized the initiative withsweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons.   This time, some U.S. officials said, Gorbachev may propose a 25percent reduction in ground forces in Europe and openingnegotiations in Vienna in late fall.   Pentagon and other estimates of NATO and Warsaw Pact troopstrengths vary widely _ from a 900,000-man edge for the East to a200,000 Western edge.   The Warsaw Pact has a decided lead in tanks and artillery. ThePentagon estimates the Soviet-led alliance has 52,000 tankscompared to 20,000 in NATO, and 43,000 artillery pieces compared toNATO's 18,000.   The Soviets keep 380,000 of their armored and motorized groundtroops at a high state of readiness in East Germany, 80,000 inCzechoslovakia, and 40,000 in Poland, acording to the London-basedInstitute for International Strategic Studies.   Other U.S. officials said Gorbachev might postpone anyinitiatives until after the Moscow summit, and afterwards cut trooplevels unilaterally.   One U.S. official predicted 50,000 to 70,000 Soviet troops mightbe withdrawn. Another U.S. official said as many as 100,000 RedArmy troops could be pulled back. Both officials spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Another veteran observer, former Defense Secretary Harold Brown,forecast that Gorbachev might try to throw Reagan off balance atthe Moscow summit by announcing a unilateral withdrawal.   Brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the Soviets``move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front.''   Gorbachev and his Warsaw Pact allies have been urging, for twoyears, that the United States and the 15 other nations in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization began a new round of talks onconventional arms.   The earlier Mutual Balanced Force Reduction talks, which beganin 1973, failed to produce agreement even on the number of troopsin the opposing forces.   Reagan administration officials believe a breakthrough may bepossible because Gorbachev seems to have accepted the Westernargument that the Warsaw Pact must make larger cuts than NATO toredress its geographic and numerical advantages.   ``The Soviets can afford to take significant cuts withouthurting their military capability,'' one U.S. official said. ``Thefirst U.S. objective is to get the Soviets down to NATO levels.''   The Kremlin has also showed signs of addressing Western concernsthat the Soviet Union did not meet the human rights pledges it madein the 1975 Helsinki accord.   Senior U.S. officials said Shevardnadze told Shultz in Genevathat his government would soon change its policies on religiouspractices and religious education. Although he did not offer anydetails, his statement was taken seriously by the U.S. side.</TEXT></DOC>
