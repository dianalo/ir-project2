In a surprising turn, Venezuela backed off from earlierindications to Vice President Dan Quayle that it wouldincrease exports by several hundred thousand barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia, also expected to help offset the loss ofIraqi and Kuwaiti crude caused by the Mideast crisis, stillhasn't increased output by any substantial amount. Thekingdom remains committed to such a step and is studying it,Saudi officials said yesterday.   The reluctance of the two countries to export more oilright now reflects their fear that doing so might permanentlyundermine the integrity of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, already weakened by the hostilitiesbetween Iraq and Kuwait. These four countries, plus Iran, areOPEC's founders. In fact, yesterday Iran sharply criticizedthe notion of any unilateral production increases.   In Caracas, Venezuelan government officials said outputwould be kept within Venezuela's OPEC quota of 1.9 millionbarrels a day unless the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries agreed to a new &quot;concerted and coordinated effort&quot;to increase oil supplies.   President Bush indicated at a news conference lateyesterday that he still expects an increase after talking byphone with Venezuela's president. &quot;I called him to thank himfor what I understood was a Venezuelan willingness to step upand increase production -- they can still do it at areasonably efficient rate, I'm told -- and to thank him forhis approach on this,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;He told me that he'dsent his foreign minister to various capitals to coordinateall of this.&quot;   The Venezuelan retrenchment shocked U.S. oil industryofficials -- as well as officials of Venezuela's national oilcompany. Officials of Petroleos de Venezuela confirmed thatthey had already increased oil production by between 100,000and 200,000 barrels a day in the last few days on theunderstanding they could sell more than the OPEC quota. Theoil, however, was stored and not shipped.   &quot;Venezuela has gone back on its commitment to increaseproduction,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vicepresident of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. &quot;Andthis pushes up the time frame when the U.S. has to come to adecision on its {strategic} petroleum reserve.&quot;   His comments echo those of oil industry officials,including the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,who are pushing the U.S. government to begin drawing suppliesquickly from the strategic reserve. They insist that this isnecessary to help offset the recent disappearance from themarket of some four million barrels a day of Iraqi andKuwaiti crude.   The oil companies are concerned about the supplysituation, the price runups that can occur on hints ofshortages and the possible blame that falls on them as pricesrise.   The reserve currently holds just under 600 millionbarrels, but the Bush administration has indicated it doesn'tthink releasing its oil into the marketplace is warrantedyet.   Many oil companies expected substantial additionalsupplies of oil from both Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to be onthe way by now. The companies had requested extra barrelsfrom those producers just in recent days after President Bushhad said both promised increases in output.   Yesterday, the oil companies still were waiting for wordthey would get the oil. &quot;Communications have taken place withSaudi Arabia and with Petroleos de Venezuela relative toincreased supplies, but there has been no confirmation,&quot; saidan official of a major oil company that previously had beenbuying oil from Iraq.   It is understood that Saudi officials this week areconsidering the &quot;nominations&quot; for more petroleum -- as suchpurchaser requests are known -- including one from KuwaitPetroleum Co., the Kuwaiti national oil company that iscontinuing to operate in exile from Britain. It previouslysupplied its European refining and marketing network from itsown nation's oil output.   Saudi Arabia is moving cautiously, oil experts say,because it must consider the politics of its region as wellas pure petroleum economics. The Saudis want a stable oilmarket, however, and once they take action, it is assumedthey could replace as much as half -- or two million barrelsa day -- of the lost Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.   Although Venezuela doesn't have as much spare capacity,extra output by it could make an especially big difference toU.S. oil supplies. For the U.S., Venezuelan oil is known as a&quot;short-haul&quot; crude, only six days away by tanker from itsmain customers, American oil companies. Transport time for atanker from the Mideast is about 30 days.   Complicating the picture in Venezuela apparently is anoil-policy disagreement within the government. On one side isthe national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, which iswilling, even eager, to produce as much as it can sell andhas even suggested Venezuela pull out of OPEC. On the otheris the government oil ministry, which wants Venezuela tomaintain good relations with others in the organization ithelped found.   So far OPEC politics is the overriding factor. &quot;We arewilling to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, ifit's a concerted effort in OPEC, but we would like to have aconsensus first,&quot; a petroleum ministry official said inCaracas.   Another government official said that the president ofVenezuela had been willing to increase production in theimmediate aftermath of the Iraqi invasion but that &quot;thereaction was so strong from the other ministers {in OPEC}that the order was rescinded.&quot;   This official said Venezuela's oil minister now isrequesting an emergency session of OPEC to consider acoordinated effort. &quot;Venezuela, which does not wish to raiseproduction unilaterally, has joined Saudi Arabia in askingfor a meeting as soon as possible,&quot; he said.   The Saudis and the Venezuelans haven't gotten much supportyet in their call for a meeting. Few OPEC oil ministers wantto renew the kind of wrenching debate they had in late Julywhen President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was threatening Kuwaitwhile demanding a $7-a-barrel increase in OPEC's &quot;reference,&quot;or target, price.   This time, many ministers worry, OPEC would be even moreseriously split between those backing Iraq, which stronglyobjects to any changes in the July agreement, and thosesupporting Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The debate over whowould represent Kuwait would also be bitter.   Iraq renewed its warnings yesterday against any OPECnations planning to increase output to replace its blockedsupplies. At a Caracas news conference, the Iraqi ambassadorto Venezuela said &quot;those who take action against us willsuffer damage.&quot; He did not say what sort of retaliation Iraqhad in mind.   Some people within OPEC expressed hope that any meetingmight be unnecessary within a few days. They weren'tspecific, but yesterday it was announced that Jordan's KingHussein, who has been trying to act as an intermediary in thecrisis, will meet with President Bush carrying a message fromIraqi President Saddam Hussein.   Many OPEC ministers also endorse the view of SadekBoussena, OPEC president and Algeria's oil minister, thatworld oil supplies remain ample. The oil glut so widelypublicized until the Aug. 2 invasion hasn't gone away, theynoted.   &quot;Big oil companies in the world intend to harm OPEC bytaking advantage of the current situation,&quot; Iran's PresidentAli Akbar Rafsanjani said, according to the official Iraniannews agency. &quot;OPEC members equally have no right to committreachery against their people in favor of the global oildevourers,&quot; Mr. Rafsanjani added. He was speaking afterreceiving Venezuela's foreign minister, who delivered amessage from the Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez.   Still, several OPEC countries capable of increasingproduction are doing so. These are Nigeria, Indonesia andLibya -- and Iran.   Monitors of OPEC production, including Cristina Haus ofEnergy Security Analysis Inc. and the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation's Mr. Goldstein, place Iran's output ataround 3.2 million barrels a day, slightly above its OPECquota of 3.1 million. In addition, Iran has been speedilyunloading unsold oil it had sitting in Europe before theIraq-Kuwait crisis broke out.   According to London-based traders, Iran had eight verylarge crude carriers parked offshore Northwest Europe -- eachholding about 1.6 million barrels of crude -- and anequivalent amount stored onshore until the crisis. All thathas been sold within the past few days, at the sharply higherprices in effect this month.   Nonetheless, said Mr. Goldstein, world oil supplies aretaking a fresh jolt from the latest developments. &quot;We havenow lost the equivalent of 90 million barrels in the matterof August oil supplies that we thought would be available,&quot;he said.</TEXT></DOC>
