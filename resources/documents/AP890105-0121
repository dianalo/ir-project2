(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six men accused of funnelingmercenaries and supplies to the Contra rebels argued before a judgeThursday they are innocent of Neutrality Act charges because theUnited States was waging war with Nicaragua.   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger, who also heard testimony onthe so-called ``at peace'' issue Dec. 2 as part of a defense motionto dismiss the indictment, said he expected decide the matter withindays.   In the first half of the continuing pretrial hearing last month,the defendants argued that the Neutrality Act applies only tonations with which the United States is at peace. They contend theReagan administration was running a de facto war against Nicaragua'sSandinista government at the time of their activities.   Thursday's first defense witness was former top CIA analyst DavidMacMichael, who testified that during his 1981-83 tenure the agencyorganized and directed the Contras against Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government.   ``I would say they (the CIA) had a military mission,'' MacMichaelsaid. ``Not only combat, but support, supplies, transportation.''   MacMichael testified over prosecution objections. They said theyfeared he would disclose CIA secrets. The judge ruled he could speakon matters already in the public record.   Outside court, defendant Mario Calero, brother of Contra leaderAdolfo Calero, angrily accused the govenrment of harassing theindicted men while they await trial. He ridiculed the government'scontention that the United States was at peace with the Sandinistas.   ``When you mine harbors and run the show ... you are really notjust de facto at war _ you're at war,'' Calero told reporters.``Perhaps the United States has not been honest enough with itselfto up and admit it.''   MacMichaels' testimony Thursday sought to back up Adolfo Calero'stestimony last month that former national security adviser OliverNorth was providing the rebels with $32 million at the same time thedefendants were training anti-Sandinista mercenaries.   The defendants also have submitted volumes of the Tower Report onthe Iran-Contra affair.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Dubelier argued that no declared warexisted and that North and others are facing indictment for theirallegedly illegal activities.   In Washington, Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, citing``difficult classified information problems,'' moved Thursday todismiss the two central charges against North. Walsh said the movewas prompted because the Reagan administration was refusing to allowthe release of numerous classified documents North wants tointroduce in his defense.   The Miami group was indicted in June after charges of Reaganadministration foot-dragging during the highly publicizedinvestigation, which at one point became the focal point ofcongressional hearings.   Opponents of aid to the Contras accused then-Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III of stalling the case because it threatened touncover illegal activities by North.   The Miami indictment accuses the group of violating theNeutrality Act by launching operations against the Sandinistagovernment from U.S. soil from October 1984 to March 1985.   The indictment accuses them of recruiting and trainingmercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying the rebels withequipment, leading them on expeditions, including one aimed atblowing up a Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws.   The seven original defentants were Thomas Posey, head of theAlabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance group; Mario Calero, aformer supply manager for the rebels; Joe Adams, Adolfo Calero'sformer bodyguard; Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who turnedagainst the effort and went to authorities; Maco Stewart, a wealthyformer Texas businessman and state official who now lives in France;Jose Coutin, a Miami Cuban and former CMA liaison in Florida, andAlex Martinez, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker.   Adams pleaded guilty, and Roettger fined him $50 and sentencedhim to a day of probation. The other six defendants continue tofight the charges, which could result in federal prison sentences ofup to eight years on the Neutrality Act violations.</TEXT></DOC>
