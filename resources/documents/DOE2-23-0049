Magnetic intensity changes within the limits from +37to -37 Oe. In transverse fields measurements are carried out for threeangle values (0, 45 and 90 deg) between the transverse magnetic fielddirection and the photomultiplier plane. The investigation results obtainedshow that longitudinal magnetic fields affect less the photomultiplieramplitude than transverse ones. Hysteresis effects involving the magnetichardness of photomultiplier electrode material are characteristic formost home photomultipliers. Change in photomultiplier orientation relativeto the transverse magnetic field changes the photomultiplier characteristicsnot more than by 25%. Effect of orientation on the photomultiplier amplitudein the longitudinal field is absent.</TEXT></DOC>
