Soon to be added are Norton LambertCorp's Closeup-LAN; R2LAN from Digital Communications Associatesand Carbon Copy from Microcom.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksCommunications SoftwareRemote ControlAccess MethodsMarket ShareProduct Development.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   More products on the LANscape: (LAN versions of remote software.)andO;(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Tara SextonandM;and Bob EnyartandM;Cashing in on the growing success of local area networks, more and moredevelopers are unleashing LAN versions of their remote-control software.andM;Standard PC remote software enables a user to operate programs and accessperipherals such as printers and modems on a remote PC via a modem.andP;  RemoteLAN packages offer these features while adding the flexibility ofnode-to-node communications that let users share networked applications.andM;In addition, remote LAN packages can be used for technical support,work-group conferencing and training, developers said.andP;  Networked users at''viewer'' personal computers can read the host PC's screen as it accesses anapplication.andM;Of the seven communications vendors recently polled by PC Week, six haveannounced or are shipping remote LAN software.andP;  Packages now availableinclude LANassist by Fresh Technology Group, of Mesa, Ariz.; NETremote fromBrightwork Development Inc., of Red Bank, N.J.; and The Network Eye byArtisoft Inc., of Tucson, Ariz.andM;Norton-Lambert Corp.'s Close-Up/LAN and Digital Communications AssociatesInc.'s R2LAN are both scheduled for release next month, and the LAN versionof Microcom Inc.'s Carbon Copy is due by summer, according to sources closeto the companies.andP;  Triton Technologies licenses its Co-Session remotesoftware to Brightwork Development and does not plan to release a commercialversion, company officials said.andM;The new packages, which support either IBM's NetBIOS, Novell Inc.'s SPX orboth network protocols, each offer different RAM requirements and featuressuch as chat-box windows, remote printing, multiple windows, graphics supportand conference  sessions.andM;Norton-Lambert's Close-Up/ LAN supports all of those features, both SPX andNetBIOS and, depending on how the software is configured, requires between65K and 75K bytes of memory for the viewer PC and 25K to 50K bytes of memoryfor the host.andM;''It works as a team with our original Close-Up,'' said Richard de Mornay,vice president of marketing for the Santa Barbara, Calif., company.andP;  ''Itexpands our proven PC-to-PC technology to include the LAN environment.''andM;Digital Communications' R2LAN, the firm's network version of its Remote2asynchronous communications software, is a two-part package that requires 90Kbytes of memory for the viewer PC and 60K bytes for the host.andM;R2LAN supports NetBIOS-compatible networks and offers such features asgraphics support and a chat box, with which users can send prompts to remoteusers that automatically pop up on-screen.andP;  The software is also compatiblewith Remote2-equipped systems.andM;''This allows async users to call into the network using Remote2 andcommunicate with any PC on the LAN,'' said Stan Hayes, a spokesman for theAlpharetta, Ga., company.andM;Other remote LAN packages, which trade features for low memory requirements,include The Network Eye, LANassist and NETremote.andM;''The most important thing to users we found was low memory -- the smallerthe better,'' said Brightwork Development Vice President Greg Gianforte,adding that NETremote requires 70K bytes of memory on the viewer PC and 8K to13K bytes on the host.andP;  Supporting both IPX and NetBIOS, NETremote does notinclude a chat box, Gianforte said.andM;Another product easy on RAM is NetBIOS-compatible The Network Eye, which,depending on the video adapter, takes just 1K byte to 6K bytes on the host PCand 30K bytes on the viewer.andM;Finally, LANassist, which has configurable chat boxes, is IPX-compatible andrequires 100K bytes on the viewer PC and 3K to 6K bytes of memory on thehost.andP;  The software can be used for several different tasks, according toBill Kroll, the product's worldwide-distribution manager.andM;For example, Charles Banks, information systems director for CPU Corp. inHouston, uses LANassist mainly for electronic mail.andP;  Users at CPU's fivewarehouses across the country can communicate instantaneously usingLANassist's chat box, he said.andP;  ''It's cheaper than long-distance and fasterthan electronic mail,'' Banks said.andM;Stuart Crane, a systems-development manager for Impact Resources in Columbus,Ohio, and an R2LAN beta user, has discovered that remote LAN software is aninvaluable teaching aid.andM;Crane pointed out that if someone doesn't know how to work an application, aco-worker who does can hook up and walk the novice through the programwithout having to leave his or her desk.andM;''It's a lot easier than thumbing through pages of documentation,'' Cranesaid.andP;  ''In fact, it makes a lot of things easier.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
