Shanor said the EEOC has more than 30 cases pending in courtsaround the country in which it alleges that employers discriminatedagainst older workers by limiting their fringe benefits.   ``We estimate that over half of these cases would requiredismissal ... absent remedial legislation,'' Shanor told a jointhearing of the House Select Committee on Aging and two Education andLabor subcommittees.</TEXT></DOC>
