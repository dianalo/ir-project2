The Dayton, Ohio-based paper, pulp and electronic publishing concern said it must receive a favorable Internal Revenue Service ruling on the previously announced split-up of Georgia Kraft Co. before the project can begin. Mead also said that members of the United Papermakers International Union local must approve a tentative contract agreement reached last week.    The new mill, which is expected to employ an estimated 200 workers when completed in 1991, would be located between Phenix City and Eufaula, adjacent to a mill Mead will acquire as part of dividing the assets of Georgia Kraft, which has been jointly owned by Mead and Temple-Inland Inc. The new facility will have an initial capacity of 350,000 tons a year. Coated natural kraft is widely used in beverage, food and general consumer packaging. </TEXT></DOC>
