That's the philosophy of aroma researchers at a NewJersey company whose customers range from soap manufacturers to themakers of fine perfumes. They even formulated a ``dinosaurvegetation'' fragrance for the Philadelphia Zoo.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>HAZLET, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A honey bee would likely have a nervousbreakdown if trapped inside a New Jersey fragrance factory wherescientists are constantly in search of new scents to sell.   An overwhelming odor fills the plant of International Flavorsand Fragrances. It is the mingled essence of hundreds ofconcentrated odors released into the air when workers opencanisters filled with rare ingredients that are blended to create adesired smell.   Sweet orange and rare rose oils compete with spicy vanilla andcinnamon. A lovely lavender scent tangles in the air with thewoodsy odor of moss.   IFF scientists have devised scents for detergent companies thatask for something ``fresh'' or ``clean.'' They put the smell inproducts that range from household air fresheners to expensiveperfumes.   IFF researchers also have faced some unusual challenges, sayscompanmy spokesman William G. Dalton. When the Philadelphia Zoowanted to let children experience all their senses in its new``Treehouse'' exhibit, IFF devised a ``dinosaur vegetation''fragrance.   When the owner of a shopping mall bakery was overwhelmed by theomnipresent odor of a pizza shop next door, ``he needed sensorycompetition,'' Dalton says. ``We developed a smell for fresh-bakedgoods, and it worked.''   In 1988, IFF, which employs 4,800 people in 36 countries,reported net sales of $839.5 million and a net income of $128.7million. The company touts itself as the ``ghostwriter'' to itsclients, refusing to identify any of the famous brands offragrances the company has developed.   Not everyone is impressed with the smells, though.Environmentalists and local residents have complained about noxiousodors and discharges into the Raritan Bay, prompting stateenvironmental officials to impose fines.   At times, those fines have been stiff, including a $1.25 millionpenalty in October 1986 for groundwater pollution. In view of theproblems, the company is modifying its monitoring equipment as thefacility continues to grow.   The business of fragrance boomed when federal health officialsbanned the use of an anti-bacterial ingredient in soaps that killedodor-causing bacteria, Dalton says.   ``Fragrance was the natural substitute,'' Dalton says.   But the fascination with fragrance is hardly a new phenomenon.In February, archaeologists dug up a 2,000-year-old flask of oilthat might have been used to anoint ancient Israelite kings.   Today, scents are found in advertising strips between the pagesof magazines, in most every brand of shampoo and even in plastictoys.   ``We have not seen any indication that there is too muchfragrance on the market,'' Dalton says. ``People get excited by newfragrances. As long as it's pleasing, it's acceptable.''   To get public reaction to a newly developed scent, IFF hireslocal residents ``to smell a variety of different things in avariety of ways, whether on skin or cloth or whatever,'' says IraKatz, director of research and development. ``We're not necessarilyinterested in whether they personally like it, but whether itcovers a malodor, such as body odor or kitchen odor.''   Testers in cubicles _ mostly women _ take quick sniffs fromsmall jars, then record the overall intensity of each. In someinstances, the testers have sniffed forearms, smelled dank laundryor even hovered over a row of smelly garbage cans.   In IFF's compounding facility next door, employees look likechefs as they mix oils, crystals and other liquids instainless-steel buckets and tanks to produce concentrates ofvarious fragrances. The ``recipes'' are top-secret and divided upamong several employees to protect the secrecy of a customer'sformula, says Ted Trembley, general manager of the IFF compoundingfacility.   The fragrance compounds are then shipped to a customer's ownplant, where they are mixed with other ingredients to create thecompleted product.   The raw ingredients used to produce an individual fragrance varyin their rarity. Bulgarian ``rose otto,'' for instance, is perhapsthe most expensive _ it takes one ton of rose petals to make abouttwo pounds of the intensely strong-smelling oil worth more than$5,000, Trembley says.   The high cost of natural ingredients such as sandalwood andexotic flowers has led IFF researchers to devise methods ofartificially reproducing scents.   The scientists also have devised a method to capture a scent inits natural state _ the most desirable intensity, Trembley says.   ``A fresh flower does not have the same molecular structureafter it is cut,'' he says.   To duplicate those exact scents, scientists use a portablemechanism that can be taken anywhere, from the tiny greenhouse onthe roof of IFF headquarters to a large field of flowers in Europe.   The method involves placing a small glass globe over a flowerand using a simple pump to draw the air around the blossom into asmall tube, says Robert Trenkle, a senior project chemist.   An absorbent material in the tube captures the ``aromamolecules,'' and the material is then analyzed with a spectrometerto determine its primary components.   ``The trickiest part is putting all the components back togetherand coming up with the same scent,'' Trenkle says.   A flower's scent, he says, is an ``elaborate mixture ofchemicals being emitted...usually to attract an insect. A flower'sodor is not for us to enjoy. It's for a much more importantreason.''   In the past decade, IFF has concentrated on capturing thousandsof fragrance ``notes'' and reproducing them for the benefit of thehuman nose, Dalton says. Some fine perfumes, he says, may becombined from 1,500 ingredients.   ``Our perfumers are very creative people,'' he says. ``They areactually artists starting with a blank canvas, developing afragrance from zero.''   Despite the technological advances made in creating new scentsand synthetically reproducing scents, Dalton acknowledges that onepart of IFF's scientific and creative process will probably neverbe duplicated.   ``We can test our products only with the human nose,'' he says.``And even then, it's still very subjective.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
