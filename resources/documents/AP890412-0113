Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who made the proposal, said thecommittee hasn't used its subpoena power in at least 15 years, buthe felt it was important to ``send a strong message to theinterested parties that we expect all parties to cooperate.''   Miller heads the Subcommitee on Water, Power and Offshore EnergyResources which will be handling the spill investigation for theHouse.   Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz., said greatdiscretion would be used.   ``We haven't been exactly fast and loose with subpoena power,''Udall said.   The committee vote was unanimous, though Republicans said itseemed premature since no one had refused to cooperate yet.   The Exxon Valdez, a tanker owned by Exxon Corp., dumped 10million gallons of oil into the Prince William Sound on March 24when it ran aground. The spill into one of the nation's mostpristine areas continues to threaten environmentally sensitiveareas of the Alaskan shore.   Miller has not yet scheduled hearings.</TEXT></DOC>
