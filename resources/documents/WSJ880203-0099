Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR NDX </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New York Stock Exchange board is expected to vote tomorrow on a proposed two-tier limit on program trading, industry sources said.    The plan would reinforce the Big Board's existing restrictions on a major form of program trading known as index arbitrage. These curbs, scheduled to expire Friday, were introduced Jan. 14 in an attempt to limit stock-price volatility. Program trading involves rapid buying or selling of big baskets of stocks; in index arbitrage, such transactions are offset by trades in the stock-index futures market.    The NYSE proposal would place tighter controls on the exchange's automated order-execution computer system, called SuperDot, which is central to most program trading. A second proposal said to be before the board would eliminate all program trading using the SuperDot system. But that proposal is given a smaller chance of passing the board, the sources said.    Details of the two-tier proposal are still sketchy. But sources said that under the new plan Wall Street firms would be banned from using SuperDot for program trading in their own accounts after the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves more than 50 or 75 points from its opening level. Moreover, the firms wouldn't be able to use the system even for customers' program trading if the industrials index made a wider move -- perhaps 75 or 100 points.    Currently, the Big Board is asking firms to refrain from using SuperDot for program trades if the Dow industrials move more than 75 points.    &quot;The current political climate is such that something will happen,&quot; said an executive of a big Wall Street firm about the expected proposal vote. Another securities industry source called the proposals &quot;in the public interest.&quot;    A Big Board spokeswoman declined to comment on the proposal.    Index arbitrage has been blamed for increasing stock price volatility and, in turn, driving small investors from the market. Defenders of index arbitrage, including many brokerages and corporate users, counter that it benefits the markets because it helps to keep stock and stock index futures prices closer in line.    Equity traders applauded the NYSE proposal. &quot;I think that it's constructive,&quot; said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. &quot;It will show investors, both institutional and retail, that the marketplace is attempting to stabilize itself.&quot;    Shearson recently stopped index arbitrage for its own account after customer complaints about market volatility gathered speed.    Another trader, Jerry Hinkle at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., said that the proposal &quot;certainly would be a psychological aid.&quot; He added, &quot;If they can limit volatility in the marketplace, you're apt to get more players.&quot;    But trader Dudley Eppel at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said he didn't think the proposal goes far enough. &quot;A limit of 75 points is way too high,&quot; he contended, adding that he favors banning program trading through the SuperDot system. &quot;I'd like to see the 75-point limit reduced substantially.&quot;    John L. Keller, president of Corinthian Capital Co., a Denver-based money management firm, called the 75-point limit &quot;totally inadequate. That daily volatility is too much.&quot;    At tomorrow's meeting the Big Board also is expected to discuss for the first time the possibility of price limits on individual stocks. That proposal is considered unlikely to be approved by the board if it comes to a vote. </TEXT></DOC>
