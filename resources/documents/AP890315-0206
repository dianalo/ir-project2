The service, in a brief statement, said the Lockheed Missiles andSpace Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif., would receive a``cost-plus-incentive-fee contract'' valued at $921.6 million toproduce 64 of the new long-range, submarine-launched missiles.   ``The work will be performed in Sunnyvale and is expected to becompleted in September 1991,'' the Navy added.   The award comes at a time when the Navy is preparing its firsttest shot of the Trident II from a Trident submarine, the USSTennessee, off the coast of Florida. That first submerged test isexpected within the next week or so. Previous tests have beenconducted from launch pads on land at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
