Components analyzed include solar radiation, atmospheric radiation,water surface radiation, and evaporative and conduction heat flux. Thenormal range of values of each component are tabulated, and worked examplesare provided to illustrate the use of the expressions for a water surfacein the field, and to gain some idea of the environmental effect of waste-heatdisposal.</TEXT></DOC>
