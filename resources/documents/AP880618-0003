U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson on Friday granted apreliminary injunction sought by the World Wildlife Fund and theAmerican Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The groupswanted the pandas returned to China and their import permitinvalidated because they say the exhibit exploits an endangeredspecies.   The pandas _ named Le Le and Nan Nan _ have been on exhibit atthe zoo since May 24 after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceissued the import permit.   The wildlife fund contends the permit should not have beenissued because the zoo's plans did not meet federal requirementsthat endangered animals be imported only if the importation is for``purposes which are not detrimental to the survival of thespecies'' and the animals are ``not to be used for primarilycommercial purposes.''   Johnson said the Fish and Wildlife Service had not been awarethe zoo was charging a special fee to view the pandas so there wasno evidence the agency had even considered the commercial nature ofthe exhibition.   The wildlife fund had however ``demonstrated a likelihood ofsuccess on the merits on this issue,'' Johnson said. But the judgeadded that a full hearing on whether the exhibit should be closedwould be scheduled later.   Ellen Efros, an attorney for the zoo, had argued before JohnsonMonday that the zoo had established the separate fee for the pandaexhibit for financial accounting purposes only.   Ms. Efros said closing the exhibit would rob the public of achance to view an endangered species and learn something aboutChina. In addition, she said it could have a potentially harmfuleffect on U.S.-Chinese relations.</TEXT></DOC>
