The plan is part of a $2.8 billion fiscal 1987 supplemental budget request that the Defense Department will present to Congress next week alongside a $312 billion funding request for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1.    Although the Pentagon didn't spell out what the new space vehicle would be used for, some analysts viewed the plan as a signal that the Reagan administration is pushing early testing and deployment of kinetic energy weapons.    The request is partly a response to the grounding of the space shuttle, which already has delayed some strategic defense tests. The new launch vehicle, however, would be capable of lifting into orbit a payload of as much as 150,000 pounds, three times the 50,000-pound limit for the shuttle, a Pentagon official said.    &quot;It's important to lift heavy loads and put them on platforms in space,&quot; said Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. He added that the new vehicle would help the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization to &quot;work along lines that seem a little more promising now than they did several months ago.&quot;    A military consultant specializing in strategic defense said that &quot;in the last six months, there's been more emphasis at the Pentagon toward getting a heavy lift that can do some things in the near term.&quot;    According to U.S. intelligence reports, the Soviet Union is designing a launch vehicle capable of lifting about 200,000 pounds into orbit.    Meanwhile, many conservative supporters of the Star Wars program, as the president's Strategic Defense Initiative is called, have been pushing the Pentagon to concentrate more on current antimissile technologies and less on more exotic laser systems. Among the near-term technologies being discussed are weapons stations to be lifted into space to fire guided projectiles at intercontinental missiles launched by the Soviet Union.    Although the heavy-lift vehicle is getting its initial push from the Defense Department, it also has supporters at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A NASA official said the agency's planned space station could be carried more cheaply by a heavy-lift vehicle than by the shuttle.    Certain scientific experiments, such as the lifting of giant telescopes into space, also could be accomplished more cheaply by a new heavy-lift vehicle, the official said.    At this stage, it isn't known whether the new vehicle would be manned or unmanned, Secretary Weinberger said. One possibility being discussed is a reusable, unmanned rocket.    Altogether, the Pentagon is seeking an additional $500 million for this year's strategic defense program. Of that, $250 million would be committed to researching the new launch vehicle; $70 million to space surveillance; $60 million to space guns; $70 million to laser weapons; $40 million to the overall architecture of the Star Wars system; and $10 million to a handful of other SDI projects. The budget for fiscal 1987 already provides $3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative.    The remainder of the Pentagon's supplemental budget request would be committed to a mix of military programs. The Defense Department is seeking $443 million to fund a 3% military pay increase, as well as certain improvements in benefits.    The request also includes $300 million for aircraft specially configured to transport special warfare groups, such as the Army Green Berets. In recent months, the Pentagon has been criticized for failing to provide adequate military transport for these groups.    The Pentagon also is seeking an additional $60 million to fund cooperative research projects within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman designate of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is a staunch advocate of the cooperative programs, which he contends would reduce duplication of systems within the alliance. </TEXT></DOC>
