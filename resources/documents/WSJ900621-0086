The House voted 327-93 to override the veto, which was Mr.Bush's 12th since taking office. The Senate, which voted67-30 for the bill last month, is scheduled to vote today onoverriding the veto, and Democratic proponents of the measureand Republican opponents both say the outcome will be veryclose. As in the House, a veto override requires at least atwo-thirds vote.</LP><TEXT>   The Senate vote would have been 68-32 with all senatorsvoting, based on later statements by the three senators whodidn't vote. Those favoring the legislation included all 55Democrats and 13 Republicans, while 32 Republicans opposedit. So two of the 13 Republicans will have to join their GOPcolleagues in a vote to sustain the veto, assuming no otherswitches occur.   The bill vetoed by Mr. Bush was the more-modest Senateversion, accepted by the House last week. It would letfederal employees engage in more off-the-job politicalactivity, including holding positions in political parties,attending party conventions as delegates and raising moneyfrom fellow union members. But running for elective officewould still generally be banned. And on-the-job politicalactivity, such as wearing a campaign button at work, wouldn'tbe permitted anymore.</TEXT></DOC>
