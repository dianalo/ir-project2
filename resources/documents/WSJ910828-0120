Klein</HL><DATE>08/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><LP>   When I visited the training camp of the National FootballLeague Indianapolis Colts two weeks ago, I was given a rosterlisting the players by height, weight and position. Thenumbers in the weight column seemed extraordinarily large,even for pro footballers. A tally revealed that of the 89 menlisted, 21 weighed 280 pounds or more and 11 of those were ator over 300 pounds.   Curious, I later dug up the roster I'd received when I wasat the Colts' camp in 1984. It listed 100 players, of whomonly one had weighed in at more than 280 pounds. Thatgentleman -- an offensive lineman listed at 289 -- still iswith the team. His weight today is 308 pounds.</LP><TEXT>   Assuming that the Colts are an average NFL team -- andtheir record of 24 wins and 24 losses over the past threeseasons indicates just that -- something is up in the leaguebesides the numbers on the scales. The NFL's powers-that-be,as well as those of the football colleges that feed it, sayit's weight training, large meals and a form of naturalselection that's funneling more very big men into theirsport. Others believe that anabolic steroids also areinvolved, despite recent (and, many say, belated) efforts toban them. The evidence of the senses favors the latterstance.   In case you're coming in late, a few words of explanationare in order. Steroids are substances that, combined withexercise, promote gains in stamina, muscle and weight. That'shelpful for football linemen and linebackers, the sport'sheavy-duty positions. Their use also has been linked to suchless-happy affects as mood swings, sterility and ailments ofthe heart, liver and kidneys. It's particularly an issue insports because steroids give users an artificial -- and thusunfair -- advantage.   The debate over the extent of steroid use in football hasbeen going on for some time, but with the advent ofyear-around drug testing in the NFL and NCAA in 1990, it hasboiled down lately to three things: What the tests show, whatthe athletes say, and the true state of affairs. It helps tothink of these as steps, although goodness knows where theylead.   The bottom step is what the tests show, which is minisculesteroid use in big-time football. The NFL began drug testingin earnest (i.e., with penalties) in the training campsbefore the 1989 season. Of some 2,000 players tested, 13, or0.6%, were suspended for coming up positive. Last year, theleague instituted random testing in-season and out, andconducted some 6,000 tests. The number of positives dipped tothree.   The story is much the same at the collegiate level. Lastyear, for the first time, the NCAA began a program of randomsteroid testing in Division I football; of the 4,383 playersinvolved, 17 tested positive, one tested positive for adiuretic that can be used as a steroid mask, and there weresix no-shows. Even adding them all as positives yields afraction of 1%.   Officials of both organizations admit that their testsaren't sensitive to all steroid or steroid-like products.Still, they believe they have the situation well in hand.&quot;Even if our tests aren't perfect they function as adeterrent, and we think actual use is very low,&quot; declaresFrank Uryasz, the NCAA's director of sports sciences. &quot;Ithink of drug use as a room full of windows,&quot; offers JohnLombardo, professor of family medicine at Ohio StateUniversity and an NFL adviser on steroids. &quot;I believe we'veclosed almost all of them.&quot;   Self-reported drug use by players in surveys thatguarantee anonymity tell a somewhat different story. In one,reported in the Physician and Sportsmedicine in February, 10%of a sample of 895 NCAA varsity football players said in 1989that they'd used steroids within the previous 12 months.   The NFL Players Association and Bruce Courson, a formerPittsburgh Steeler and Tampa Bay Buccaneer lineman, last fallmailed a similar questionaire to 1,600 active or recent NFLplayers. The response was too small to generalize from; only120 players answered. But that's still a sizable number, and28% -- and 67% of the responding offensive linemen -- saidthey'd used steroids sometime in their careers. Three percentsaid they used them during the previous season.   The poor response to the survey underlines the veil ofsecrecy that surrounds the subject of steroid use in sports.&quot;It's against the rules, and against the way athletes want tobe perceived,&quot; asserts Courson, who admits using the drugsduring his playing days and says they caused irreparabledamage to his heart. &quot;It isn't attractive to be regarded as apumped-up freak who cheated to win. That's why so few playersspeak out about steroids even after their careers are done.&quot;   To get around that barrier, one group of researcherstackled the subject indirectly, asking college footballersabout their opponents' use of the drugs. The idea was to getthem to project their feelings, and, perhaps, practices. Thefindings, published last year in the journal Clinical SportsMedicine, reported that more than 97% of 351 playersquestioned said they thought at least some of their foes haveused steroids, with the mean response at 29%. More than 80%said they thought steroid use was &quot;a problem&quot; for theirsport.   Charles Yesalis, professor of health and human developmentat Pennsylvania State University, was the principal author ofthe projection study. He's a longtime student of steroids andathletics. &quot;I think that in college football, actual usefalls somewhere between the 10% self-reporting figure and the29% the players projected,&quot; he says. &quot;It's nowhere near thatless-than-1% figure the NCAA puts out.&quot;   Prof. Yesalis says he doesn't know for sure whatproportion of NFL players use the drugs, but says he's takenclose note of the testimony of admitted users, the latest ofwhom was Lyle Alzado, the former Oakland Raider: &quot;You keephearing that 50% to 75% of the linemen use them, and lesserproportions of other positions. You have to be impressed bythe unanimity.   &quot;The fact is there are steroid-type drugs that aren't onthe NFL's controlled list, and others that the tests can'tdetect. Testing may have been reduced usage some, but onlywhile players find new ways to beat it. The size of theathletes certainly isn't going down. The only reasonableconclusion is that just the dumb ones are getting caught.&quot;   Courson says the NFL Players Association study indicatedthat a large majority of steroid users would stop if theywere convinced their competitors would, but they felt thatsuch assurances weren't forthcoming. Sixty percent of all whoanswered, and 76% of the users, said their coaches eitherapproved of or didn't care about the practice. And 78% saidthey believed the league instituted steroid testing becauseof concern about its image rather than issues involvinghealth or fair play.   &quot;I know older guys in the league who still use steroids,&quot;says Courson, whose book on his struggles with the drugs,&quot;False Glory,&quot; is due out this fall. &quot;They tell me that theplayers coming out of college are much more sophisticatedabout it than they were. I suspect that, overall, not muchhas changed.&quot;   He adds: &quot;I think you'll see real change only when theincentives to cheat disappear. And the way the money in theleague is climbing, things are headed in the exact oppositedirection.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
