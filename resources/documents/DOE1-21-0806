The term &quot;full-cycle&quot;denotes that the production cycle covers various interconnected agriculturalsectors, the technical and economic development of which is based principallyon a rational use of energy resources obtained chiefly from the transformationof organic residues produced by poultry breeding activity and, to a lesserextent, by exploitation of wind energy. The restricted size of the farmallows comprehensive testing of the project's efficiency with regardto both intensive produce farming based on employment of organic fertilisersof the farm's own production and energy saving achieved. The projecthas been developed following the steps described below:- Stage A - 1979- Restructure, modernisation and automation of a poultry breeding plantwith a capacity of 100,000 laying hens. Stage B - 1980 - Land preparationand setting up of an orchard on an area of 2.5 ha. Stage C - 1984 - Anaerobicdigestion plant for treatment of poultry farm wastes. The environmentpollution problem caused by poultry farm effluents has been resolved,without increase in running costs and as a matter of fact with a notnegligible profit, by construction of an anaerobic treatment plant. Theplant has been conceived applying, to a classical anaerobic double stagecontact process, completely new technology which proved to be necessaryto treat the high load of organic matter contained in the effluents.The primary digester has a capacity of 900 cu. m whilst the secondaryone, on which a 140 cu. m gas tank is mounted, has a 200 cu. m capacity.The biogas produced at an average of 1500 cu.
