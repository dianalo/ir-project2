With the recession and increased immigration in recentyears, thousands of people have taken to the streets to makea living as vendors. They sell everything from food tofurniture to fashion, often in direct competition with nearbystores.   The legal tide appears to be clearly running against thevendors. Cities ranging from New York to Santa Ana, Calif.,have recently enacted more restrictive vendor rules. The NewYork state Legislature passed a law restricting vending onManhattan's Fifth Avenue, where dozens of vendors had set upoperation. In return, Fifth Avenue merchants agreed to offeremployment and job-training funds for some of the displacedvendors, says a spokesman for state Sen. Roy Goodman, whosponsored the legislation.   Elizabeth, N.J., in December adopted an ordinance that,among other things, requires a vendor to be at least 1,500feet from a store selling the same type of merchandise.Merchants &quot;who have to pay rent&quot; were complaining theycouldn't compete with a &quot;guy who was just opening thetailgate of his car,&quot; says city council president AngeloPaternoster.   In Santa Ana, a &quot;proliferation of pushcarts&quot; drove thecity last summer to start licensing vendors and limitingtheir numbers, says city attorney Edward Cooper.   One exception to this trend is Los Angeles, which lastmonth finally legalized sidewalk vending after a longlobbying campaign by vendors and immigrant-rights groups. Butthe vending is limited to certain districts, and some vendoradvocates worry that the measure doesn't offer &quot;enoughopportunities for illegal vendors to go straight,&quot; says aspokeswoman for councilman Michael Woo, a prime mover in thelegalization effort.                                                                                                          Russians Aim to Import   Business Education                                                                                                          AT Manhattanville College, the 10-week course on startinga business attracts all kinds of people. But never before wasone of the students the wife of a high-ranking Russiandiplomat.   Natasha Lozinskiy, whose husband, Valentin, is Russia'sfirst deputy permanent representative to the United Nations,started taking classes Jan. 13 at the school'sEntrepreneurial Center in Purchase, N.Y. Among the thingsMrs. Lozinskiy has studied so far are how to raise financing,price products and promote sales.   After boning up on entrepreneurship, Mrs. Lozinskiy saysshe plans to travel this summer to Russia with Marge Lovero,the center's director, and a group of U.S. entrepreneurs torelate what she has learned to other Russians. Organized bythe Volunteer Development Council for U.N. Delegations, theparticipants plan to visit Moscow and three other citieswhere they hope to create Russian-staffed entrepreneurialcenters.   &quot;The transformation from a centrally planned economy to afree economy has never been done before, so we are in need ofhelp,&quot; Mrs. Lozinskiy says.   As to whether she will assist the transformation bystarting a business of her own, Mrs. Lozinskiy says that forthe first time, &quot;I can imagine doing it.&quot;                                                                                                          Singin' in the Rain   To Get the Message Out                                                                                                          TO WEATHER the economic slump, some small businesses arestopping at nothing to increase sales.   Mal Silverman's six-month-old Dial-A-Mattress franchise inChicago will ship anywhere in the metropolitan area withintwo hours. To publicize that policy, he delivered a mattressto a field where a local public-television program'son-the-air paint-gun battle was wrapping up -- just in timefor the exhausted host to collapse onto the bedding.   The day after the show was broadcast &quot;was the biggestselling day we've ever had,&quot; Mr. Silverman says. Barq's RootBeer, a soft-drink maker in New Orleans, sent marketing headRick Hill to Moscow last month to prepare for the company's&quot;Soviet Union Going Out of Business Sale,&quot; planned for thissummer.   &quot;We'll have Gorbachev saying, `We lost our lease andeverything must go,'&quot; says Mr. Hill, who bought stamps, pens,medals, key chains and other memorabilia that Barq's willgive away to buyers of its root beer.   &quot;It's too difficult to compete on price in a recession,&quot;Mr. Hill says. &quot;It's more important to find ways to increasethe value of your brand.&quot; With the Soviet promotion, he says,&quot;if you buy Barq's, you're buying a piece of history.&quot;   To reach customers in Europe, Laser Plot, an Auburn,Mass., maker of electronic navigation equipment, hitched aride to the Mediterranean aboard a ship used to trainmerchant seamen. In exchange for a $500 donation and the useof Laser Plot equipment, the Massachusetts Maritime Academyagreed to let the company install one of its systems on theT/S Patriot State. In conjunction with a training cruise foracademy cadets, the 547-foot vessel sailed to ports in Italyand Spain where Laser Plot had arranged to demonstrate itsequipment for potential customers.   Says Bob McKillop, a Laser Plot technician: &quot;It was agreat opportunity for our products to get some exposureoverseas.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SMALL businesses plan virtually no increase in capitalspending this year, according to a December survey of 406companies by Cicco andamp; Associates, a Murrysville, Pa., researchfirm. . . . Nearly half of 127 franchisers contacted lastmonth by Francorp, a consulting firm in Olympia Fields, Ill.,say former corporate executives account for 25% of newfranchise applications.</TEXT></DOC>
