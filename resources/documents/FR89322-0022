Chapter 35). It isrequested that OMB approve this submission within 7 days.In December 1987, Congress passed the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987. This bill became law on January 27, 1988. The authorizationfor a demonstration program for guaranteed rural housing loans was amendedby the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-628), which was enacted on November 7, 1988. These bills providefor a demonstration program for guaranteed rural housing loans.The reason for the emergency clearance request is because of a legislativerequirement contained in the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance AmendmentsAct that the Secretary of Agriculture issue regulations that take effectnot later than 120 days of the bill becoming law.This submission consists of the regulation and associated forms to implementthe guaranteed demonstration program.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3507.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Supporting Statement</ITAG>7 CFR Part 1980 Subpart D, Rural Housing Loans<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Justification</ITAG>1. The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) is the credit agency for agricultureand rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. FmHA offerssupervised credit programs to finance family farms, modest housing, sanitarywater and sewer systems, essential community facilities and businessesand industries in rural areas. This regulation prescribes the policiesand responsibilities, including the collection and use of information,necessary to process guaranteed Rural Housing loans to moderate applicants.Section 501 of Title V of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, authorizesthe Secretary of Agriculture to extend financial assistance to construct,improve, alter, repair, replace, or rehabilitate dwellings, farm buildings,and/or related facilities to provide decent, safe, and sanitary livingconditions and other structures in rural areas.Section 517(d) of Title V of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, providesthe authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to issue loan guaranteesfor the purposes described above.Section 304 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-242) provided for the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a guaranteedhousing demonstration program.Section 1041 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance AmendmentsAct (Pub. L. 100-628) amends the above mentioned provision for the guaranteeddemonstration program and calls for the Secretary to issue regulationsthat take effect within 120 days of the bill becoming law.7 CFR Part 1980 Subpart D is currently being revised in accordance withthe requirement of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance AmendmentsAct of 1988. Currently, there is no approved paperwork burden for thisregulation.This regulation authorizes loan guarantees for single family housing loansmade by approved lenders in order to make credit available to householdsunable to get credit without the loan guarantee to assist rural familiesin obtaining decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings.Loans may be made to buy, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate a dwellingand provide related facilities for use by the applicant as a primary residenceand for various other uses to assist applicants in obtaining decent, safe,and sanitary dwellings. Loans are made by lenders and guaranteed by FmHA. The loan guarantee providesthe lender additional security in the event of a loss. Under the guaranteedrural housing program, FmHA can guarantee up to 90 percent of the loss.Guarantees may be issued only to lenders submitting necessary informationto become Approved Lenders as defined in the regulation. Approved Lendersare those lenders who have submitted information to FmHA regarding theirlending experience and financial condition. FmHA uses this informationto determine that the lender can carry out the objectives of the program.In return for submission to and approval in the Approved Lender process,FmHA permits the lender to process loans without obtaining prior approvalor input from FmHA. Once a lender is prepared to approve the loan, theyneed only notify FmHA and provide information for FmHA to identify theguarantee. FmHA issues a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee uponreceipt of a package from the lender. The commitment process is providedto provide a control mechanism to assure that a guarantee is not approvedwhen no funds are available and to list any requirements that must be metbefore the guarantee can be issued.Once a loan has been guaranteed, the lender is responsible for servicingthe loan. This consists of assuring that payments are made on a timelybasis and protecting the security property. The lender is required to memorializeits servicing efforts in the form of a memorandum. When all servicing efforts fail and a decision to liquidate is made, thelender is required to carry out the necessary actions for liquidation.Once a loan is liquidated, the lender reports any losses suffered for paymentunder the guarantee.One other aspect of the guarantee not considered above is the lender'sability to sell the guaranteed portion of the loan on the secondary market.Sale of loan notes is a common practice in mortgage lending. The regulationsprovides for a mechanism to assign the guarantee to the new holder whenthe loan is closed. Basically, the lender must identify the new holderto FmHA and authorize the transfer of the guarantee.Information collection in this regulation consists of two basic types,that is, information required of lenders and information required of applicants.2. The lender must provide FmHA with information regarding its experienceand qualifications in mortgage lending. This information is used by FmHAto determine the lender's ability to carry out the objectives of the programwithout the need for FmHA assistance and input.Information pertaining to individual loan applications is collected andassembled by the applicant and provided directly to the Lender who thenpasses it on to the FmHA loan approval official. This process is necessarybecause of the nature of the program. The applicant must provide the lenderwith information necessary to make an informed credit decision. The lenderthen provides information to FmHA so that FmHA can identify the loan, issuethe guarantee, and account for the agency's liability created by the guarantee.When the loan is made, the lender is requested to advise FmHA on any plansit has to sell the loan on the secondary market. This information is necessaryso that FmHA will know who owns the guarantee as this party is a beneficiaryof the guarantee.After the loan is made, the lender is responsible for servicing. The lenderneed not submit reports to FmHA regarding the loan unless the borrowerdefaults. The lender submits a report to FmHA regarding the default statusof the loan. This information is necessary so that FmHA can properly evaluateits position in the guarantee and provide any necessary consultation withthe lender to protect the government's interest in the loan.When all efforts to cure the default fail and the decision is made to liquidate,the lender is responsible for carrying out the liquidation and reportingthe results to FmHA. The lender must make its records available to FmHAfor audit when FmHA is requested to pay on a loss.The specific information collection to be cleared with this regulationis described below:<ITAG tagnum="84">No Forms</ITAG>Uniform Residential Appraisal ReportFmHA requires that the Lender obtain an appraisal on the collateral propertyusing the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report form. This form is not anFmHA form, although FmHA uses this form for its residential appraisals.The Uniform Residential Appraisal form is a widely accepted appraisal reportingformat and is considered standard in the appraisal industry. The burdenfor which clearance is requested is that of providing FmHA with a copyof said appraisal.The annual number of responses is estimated to be equal to the number ofloans expected under the program, 2,234 (more fully discussed below).The average time required to obtain a copy of the appraisal and submitit to FmHA is 10 minutes.Inspections of ConstructionThe Lender is responsible for carrying out and documenting 3 constructioninspections. These inspections are carried out at three definite stagesof construction so the inspector can observe the necessary items. Thisis the reason for the requirement of more than one inspection. The burdenfor Lenders consists of the time required to carry out and document theinspection. The burden on the applicant is the time to read and comprehendthe inspection report.The annual number of responses from lenders is estimated to be 1,005. Thisfigure is based on the maximum expected number of loans (2,234) multipliedtimes the expected percentage of loans that involve new construction (45%).The percentage of new construction loans was derived from FmHA's loan activityin Single Family Housing loans. The average number of inspections per loanis 3.The average public time required to carry out and document each inspectionis 30 minutes for lenders and 5 minutes for applicants.Lender CertificationAfter the lender reviews the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee (discussedbelow), the lender is required to certify that all conditions have beenmet. This would consist of signing the ``Acceptance or Rejection of Conditions''section on the conditional commitment form and returning a copy to FmHA.The annual number of respondents is estimated to be 2,234, the same asthe number of possible loans since this would need to be done one timefor each loan.The average public time required to prepare and complete the informationrequired is estimated to be 1 hour.Lender Report of Marketing PlanThis information is necessary to FmHA in order for the agency to know whetherto prepare the necessary materials for assignment of the guarantee agreement.FmHA believes the lender's marketing plans for a loan would be based onthe lender's normal business practices. This report is necessary when thelender plans to market the loan in the secondary market.FmHA expects a high percentage of the loans guaranteed under this regulationwill be sold in the secondary market. The annual number of respondentsis estimated to be 1,787 or 80 percent of the number of possible loans.The average public time required to prepare and complete the informationrequired is estimated to be 15 minutes.Loan ServicingThe lender is responsible for providing the necessary servicing for theguaranteed loan. The burden imposed by this regulation consists of a requirementthat the lender document its servicing actions. This would typically bedone through a memorandum.The annual number of respondents is estimated to be 90 per year for eachyear of loanmaking. For the three year period for which clearance is requestedfor this burden, the average number of loans requiring servicing wouldbe 312. This estimate was arrived at by considering the total number ofloans and assuming a 7 percent delinquency rate. This rate is somewhathigher than the typical mortgage lender's delinquency rate, however thehigher figure represents the additional risk to the lender causing theneed for the guarantee.The average time required for the lender to prepare and complete the informationrequired is estimated to be 15 minutes to complete the documentation ofservicing actions for FmHA purposes.Eligible Loan TransfersAn eligible loan transfer occurs when an eligible loan applicant makesapplication to assume the loan of an existing guaranteed loan borrower.A loan transfer is very similar to an application for a new loan. The paperworkneeded to complete a transfer is considered the same as for a loan application.There are no figures available to estimate how often this would occur soan estimate of ten percent of the loans made was used to determine theburden or 234 transfers per year.The average time for applicants to assemble, prepare, and submit the necessaryinformation for a loan application is 1 hour. The average time for thelender to evaluate the application and assemble it for submission to FmHAis estimated to be \1/2\ hour.Ineligible Loan TransfersAn ineligible loan transfer occurs when an ineligible loan applicant makesapplication to assume the loan of an existing guaranteed loan borrower.A loan transfer is very similar to an application for a new loan. The paperworkneeded to complete a transfer is considered the same as for a loan application.There are no figures available to estimate how often this would occur soan estimate of five percent of the loans made was used to determine theburden or 117 transfers per year.The average time for applicants to assemble, prepare, and submit the necessaryinformation for a loan application is 30 minutes. The average time forthe lender to evaluate the application and assemble it for submisstionto FmHA is estimated to be 1 hour.<ITAG tagnum="84">Forms</ITAG>Form FmHA 1980-16All guarantees issued under this regulation will be on loans made by FmHAApproved Lenders. FmHA believes that use of approved lenders will providethe most expedient means of loan processing. Eligible lenders may applyfor approved lender status. The information to be collected provides thebasis for FmHA to determine that the lender has the capacity and experiencenecessay to assure that a minimal amount of FmHA supervision and oversightis necessary. This is necessary because the Approved Lender Status willpermit the lender to take a high degree of responsibility in assuring loansare made to eligible applicants for eligible loan purposes.Respondents in this information collection activity consist of lendersinterested in Approved Lender Status. The annual number of respondentsis estimated to be 68 based on FmHA's estimate of available loan funds.Specifically, FmHA estimated that lender interest in application for approvedlender status would be limited based on the amount of funding expectedfor the program. FmHA assumed that there would be an average of 2 lendersper state interested in making application for approved lender status ineach state with the potential to fund not less than 10 loans.The average time required for a lender to assemble, prepare, and submitthe information necessary to obtain Approved Lender status is estimatedto be 4 hours.Form FmHA 1980-18Upon receipt of the application package from the Lender, FmHA will issuea Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. This form is used by FmHA to conveythe results of any loan review done by FmHA to the lender and any loanclosing requirements imposed by FmHA. This form will assure the lenderthat the loan can be guaranteed by FmHA subject to any conditions above.The estimated number of respondents for this form is directly related tothe number of loans that can be made under the program, 2,234.The average time required for the lender to review the requirements ofthe Conditional Commitment and assemble and submit the necessary informationfor response is estimated to be 1 hour.Form FmHA 1980-21In order to be considered for a loan, each applicant must submit to thelender all information necessary for the lender and FmHA to make a determinationof credit worthiness. Information will be collected by the lender and passedon to FmHA. This collection of information is considered to impact on thelender and the applicant. The applicant will submit to the lender informationon who the applicant is, such as, name, address, telephone number, statementof current annual income, net worth, age, number of persons in the household,and citizenship status. Most of this information may be found in any typicallender's application form with the possible exception of household sizeand citizenship. The lender will also need to submit information on theamount of the loan request, the name, address, contact person, and telephonenumber of the proposed lender, a brief description of the dwelling beingfinanced, the proposed loan rates and terms, a certification statementthat the loan could not be made without the guarantee, a statement of theapplicant's present housing circumstances, and evidence of legal admittancewhen the applicant is not a U.S. citizen. The lender will also submit certaininformation on the applicant's sex, race, and veteran status.Since FmHA has presently has no program authorized for applicants in themoderate income range, there are no actual records on which to make thisestimate. Based on the average size loan made in each state in the lastfiscal year and the estimated amount of loan funds, the agency estimatesa maximum of 2,234 loans per year could made under the program.The average time for applicants to assemble, prepare, and submit the necessaryinformation for a loan application is 1 hour. The average time for thelender to evaluate the application and assemble it for submission to FmHAis estimated to be \1/2\ hour.1980-17The Loan Note Guarantee and Assignment Guarantee Agreement form consistsis an agreement form involving lenders and holders reading, comprehending,and signing the form. This form is considered of a routine nature in thatit is more than likely that a number of guarantees will be issued to thesame lender. After the initial exposure to the form, the lender will befamiliar enough with the form that reading the form will not be necessaryeach time it is issued. The same form may also be used to assign the guaranteeto a holder when the lender sells the loan. Assignment forms are consideredroutine in the secondary market and FmHA believes that the holders arelikely to purchase multiple loans with guarantees that may be assigned.The number of lender responses involved is equal to the number of loanguarantees issued under the program, 2,234. The number of holders responsesis estimated to be 1,787.Since the Guarantee and the Assignment are considered to be a routine partof business, the average public time required by this form is 5 minutesfor lenders and 5 minutes for holders.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recordkeeping</ITAG>Lender File The lender is required to set up and maintain a borrower file for eachloan made under the guarantee program. This file is used to maintain documentsrelating to the loan and the guarantee.The number of lenders impacted is estimated to be 250. This figure includesthose 68 lenders estimated to apply for loan guarantees and those lenderswho presently enjoy guarantees of existing loans under the previous guaranteedloan program.The average public time required to maintain the required records is 1hour.3. The information collected is of such type and nature that the use ofimproved technology would not significantly reduce the public burden.Information from lenders applying for Approved Lender status is requiredonly once and is valid for two years. This information is not of a naturethat lends itself to improved technology. Information for each loan applicationis unique and cannot take significant advantage of improved technology.Once a loan is made, FmHA requires no reports from the lender unless theborrower defaults. Instead, FmHA simulates the repayment of the accounton its own systems thus relieving the public from the need to report thenormal status of the account.Improved technology is not possible for reporting loan servicing effortsand liquidation of loan accounts because each case is unique.4. Event effort has been made to identify and avoid unnecessary duplicationof information collection. A lender need only submit one application tobecome an approved lender. Loan applicants need submit only one applicationfor loan assistance that serves both the lender and FmHA. Loan servicingreports and liquidation reports are prepared and submitted only based onactual need and not required when there are no unusual occurrences. Duplicationof reporting is minimized by the one time collection of information andthe one time submission to FmHA to the maximum extent possible. The onlyburden identified that requires more than one annual report is that ofthe construction inspections for new construction dwellings. Inspectionsare required at three different stages of construction. This is necessaryto monitor the progress of construction and because certain items cannotbe observed at a single inspection, such as footings or unenclosed wallsfor electrical, plumbing, etc.5. The conditions involved with every loan/grant request are unique. Thisinformation is not available through other sources because of its nature.The information collected under this regulation would be very similar innature to that collected under Subpart A of Part 1944, 7 CFR.6. The information collected in this regulation places no burden on smallbusinesses or other small entities beyond that which is performed in normalbusiness practice. FmHA has minimized the burden of collecting this informationby allowing the submission of as much information as possible without aprescribed reporting format. There are four prescribed forms with thisregulation.7. Lenders apply for consideration for Approved Lender status one timeand that once approved, the lender's status is valid for two years. Ifthe lender wishes to continue its Approved Lender status, it is requestedto update the information near the end of the two year period. ApprovedLender status must be based on reasonably current information because FmHArelies on the Approved Lender's ability to make and service loans withminimal supervision.Information is collected one time only per applicant for loan making purposes.An effective lending program would be impossible to run if informationwere collected less frequently.Collection of servicing information is made only as needed and not on anyperiodic basis.8. There are no circumstances requiring collection to be inconsistent withthe guidelines of 5 CFR 1320.6. FmHA does not anticipate that it will benecessary to use methods inconsistent with 5 CFR 1320.6.9. Consultations were made with persons outside the agency to obtain theirviews on the reporting burdens contained in this regulation. Due to theemergency nature of the implementation of this regulation responses havenot been received from all sources contracted at this time. This regulationand burden assessment is also published for public comment.a. Responses were received from the following persons on the informationburden.<ITAG tagnum="15">Brian J. Chappelle, Mortgage Bankers Association of America, Tele:(202) 861-8194</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dave Crum, Georgia Residential Finance Authority, Tele: (404) 320-4840</ITAG>b. There were no major problems that could not be resolved during theseconsultations.c. Opportunity will be provided for public comment by publication in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>.10. No assurance of confidentiality will be offered. This information isconsidered public information.11. The information being collected that may be considered of a sensitivenature consists of the applicant's financial condition, credit worthiness,and income. These things are commonly considered to be private in naturebut necessary to make a determination of whether to grant credit.12. The annualized cost to the Government to develop and administer thisregulation is $151,000 based on multiplying the number of employees directlyinvolved on the preparation and administration of this regulation (102),times an annualized cost factor ($29,500), times a national average oftime the employees are involved (5%). The cost factor includes salaries,equipment, and overhead.Annual cost to respondents is estimated to be $418,368 based on multiplyingthe estimated burden times a specified wage class for two types of respondents.One class of respondent was the lender. Estimates used for the cost tothe lender was based on a cost factor of $35,000 per year. This cost factorconsiders that the lender's time will consist of both professional andclerical employees and operational expenses and other expenses of the lenderin carrying out the required responses. The other wage class was that ofthe applicant. The applicants wage used was $17,610. This figure was obtainedusing the average income of FmHA borrowers for loans made in the last fiscalyear and adding a factor of 20 percent since this program is directed tomoderate income applicants.13. Attached is a chart indicating an estimate of the annual public burden.This burden was not included in the agency's information budget becausethe program has been inactive since the late 1970's. The program is nowproposed as a demonstration program under the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, as amended.
