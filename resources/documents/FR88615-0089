The purpose of the complianceindicators is to implement the program evaluation standards by establishingminimum performance levels in essential program areas to measure the effectivenessof individual projects. If a grantee does not meet the established performancelevels, it will not be in compliance with the standards and, thus, cannotreceive continuation funding.RSA has analyzed the standards and identified performance areas that arecritical for project success and that must be measured. At this time, however,RSA is unable to establish performance levels in these areas because itlacks sufficient statistical data from currently funded projects. RSA hasdeveloped a data collection form that will enable it to obtain from existinggrantees the necessary information to establish minimum compliance indicators.The areas in which RSA plans to develop indicators are provided for informationalpurposes only in an appendix to this notice, as are the evaluation standards.RSA intends to publish proposed compliance indicators in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for public comment before establishing the indicatorsin final form.When OMB has approved the data collection form, a notice will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notifying all grantees that they will be requiredto submit to RSA, within 60 days, the required project information forfiscal year 1987 and, separately, for the first six months of fiscal year1988. This information must be sent to the Commissioner, RehabilitationServices Administration, 330 C Street SW., Room 3024, Mary E. Switzer Building,Washington, DC 20202.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
