Richard R. Pilarczyk, president and chief executive officer, and Charles E. Hallberg, executive vice president, said in an interview that the company had revenue for the quarter ended May 31 of about $4.5 million.    General Computer was spun off from Revco D.S. Inc. in March 1986. On a pro forma basis, General Computer had 1986 fourth-quarter profit of $500,000, or 34 cents a share, also on revenue of about $4.5 million.    For all of fiscal 1987, General Computer, a supplier of specialized computers and software for pharmacies, expects to report profit of &quot;a little under $600,000,&quot; or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $15.2 million to $15.4 million, the officials said.    Pro forma net for fiscal 1986 was $1.1 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of $14.5 million.    &quot;We put extreme pressure on (1987) earnings by doubling our advertising,&quot; Mr. Pilarczyk said. &quot;We used this as a positioning year.&quot;    Currently more than 80% of General Computer's revenue is generated from the sale of computers and related products. Mr. Pilarczyk predicted revenue from services will eclipse computer-system sales within two to three years.    Closely held Revco, one of the country's largest drugstore chains, retains a 22% stake in General Computer. General Computer has installed 800 computer systems in Revco's stores, and is expected to supply the rest of Revco's approximately 2,000 stores over the next few years, Mr. Pilarczyk said.    General Computer has just introduced two products that resemble telephones with built-in computers; they are aimed at pharmacies that want to increase their prescription business paid through insurers.    General Computer expects by the fall to introduce a device that calls patients at home to remind them when presciptions are due for refill.    And sometime around the first of the year, General Computer expects to begin making a machine that looks like a video game and will monitor customers' blood pressure, heartbeat and weight. Mr. Pilarczyk said the machine also may provide nutritional and other types of medical information. </TEXT></DOC>
