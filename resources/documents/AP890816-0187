MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's a tradeoff that helps to smooth theprocess of governing: while the big money goes to the cities, smalltown America gets a piece of the federal budget for its cherishedprograms, even when they flunk efficiency formulas.   That doesn't cost a lot and it can oil the machinery of Congress,where some of the power brokers of the appropriations process areveterans who come from rural districts.   But the traditional bargain is running head-on into the federalbudget crunch these days, with spending caught between anadministration that vows no new taxes and a law that enforcesdecreasing ceilings on the federal budget deficit.   That strain was showing as the House dealt with transportationappropriations just before its summer recess. The program at handwas a rural favorite called Essential Air Service, under whichairlines get subsidies for maintaining flights in and out of smallcities.   It was vital to the 1978 compromise in which Congress voted toderegulate the airlines, giving them broad leeway to set their ownroutes and fares. The program has been extended at least through1998, but not the money to fund it. Appropriations are handled yearby year, and they have been shrinking.   Congress voted $25 million in subsidies for the current fiscalyear; the bill approved by the House cuts that by more than half forthe next year.   The administration wanted to do away with Essential Air Servicesubsidies entirely; its budget says that subsidies were costing upto $500 a passenger on flights in and out of some small airports,most of them serving only a handful of passengers each day.   The House bill appropriates $12.4 million for the program in abill that was designed to cut the number of communities getting airpassenger subsidies from 110 to 48.   That was going to be done by setting new rules to limit thesubsidy to no more than $25 per passenger _ matching the estimatedcost of Amtrak rail subsidies _ and by denying air passengerpayments to any community within 100 miles of an airport that doeshave service. That covered continental U.S. airports; Alaska wouldnot be affected.   ``These criteria are reasonable and fair to rural America,''argued Rep. William Lehman, D-Fla., chairman of the appropriationssubcommittee that shaped the bill. The new formula made it throughthe appropriations committee by only one vote. On the House floor itwas erased by a point of order, because appropriations bills aresupposed to deal only in dollars, not in legislating rules for theprograms involved.   Lehman said that without the restrictions, the program includesabuses that make it indefensible. So the debate is sure to comearound again, in the Senate and in final House action.   ``Over 45 percent, or 50 of the 110 communities in thecontinental United States currently receiving subsidies emplane lessthan 5 passengers a day under this program,'' said Lehman. ``. ..Can anyone explain why the taxpayers should be paying $245,000 ayear to fly planes into Parsons, Kan., to haul an average of 0.6passengers a day. ... Or can anyone justify paying $270,000 per yearto fly planes into Lewiston, Maine, to haul 0.9 passengers a day,especially when another airport is 35 miles away?''   But Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., said the appropriation cut isdevastating to a program that already has been reformed. She saidearlier legislation ``eliminated the worse abuses'' by instituting asubsidy limit of $300 a passenger.   Then she offered some numbers that may be even more telling: 39states have communities getting Essential Air Service subsidies, andthere are 68 congressional districts involved.   Eleven cities and towns in Nebraska are among them, and Mrs.Smith said she wants her constituents ``and all rural taxpayers'' toknow she isn't surrendering but will work to get the money restored.   She said it would take another $19 million or $20 million, whichamounts to .02 percent of the total transportation appropriation, tofinance the rural air service subsidies.   ``... Rural America, home to more than one-fourth of thecountry's population, receives only $1 in federal masstransportation funds for every $28 in mass transportation fundsspent in urban America,'' she added.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
