The two railroads estimated the decision could save them 73 million Canadian dollars ($55.9 million) a year in operating costs. The companies don't expect to be operating trains without the rear rail cars before mid-1988.    On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, shares of CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd., closed at 21.50 Canadian dollars, up 1.13 dollars. CN, also based in Montreal, is owned by the federal government.    The United Transportation Union, which represents 14,000 Canadian railroad and bus workers, said it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the ruling of the Canadian Transport Commission's Railway Transport Committee. Ronald Bennett, the union's Canadian legislative director, said the union was deciding whether it could file an appeal to the courts, or to the cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.    In the U.S., more than a quarter of rail freight traffic moves on trains without cabooses. A 1982 agreement between U.S. railroads and the United Transportation Union allows for cabooses to be eliminated from all types of trains if there is mutual consent.    The Canadian commission said it believed CP and CN could operate their trains safely without cabooses provided &quot;certain conditions involving the use of modern technology and changes in operating practices are met.&quot; The ruling requires the installation of advanced automatic equipment to take over monitoring tasks now done from the caboose.    Spokesmen for CN and CP said they intend to proceed as quickly as possible with the elimination of cabooses. The two railroads own about 1,640 of the rear rail cars.    CN and CP testified at public hearings that trains without cabooses would help the companies cut costs, making them more competitive with U.S. carriers and the trucking industry. </TEXT></DOC>
