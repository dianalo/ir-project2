<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0114 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effectiveness of ceramic porous traps for removing particulate hydrocarbonsfrom diesel emissions was examined, and the effect this has on the mutagenicactivity associated with these emissions was determined. A 10.4-literdisplacement medium-duty engine (Caterpillar 3208) was run under definedconditions. The levels of total particulate matter, soluble organic fraction,and volatile organic fraction were measured in the emissions both withand without a ceramic trap and at different engine speeds. The resultsshowed an increase in the proportion of nonparticulate hydrocarbons,but the total hydrocarbon levels remained constant. The nonparticulatematerial had reduced direct-acting mutagenicity, whereas the particulate-associatedhydrocarbons (while reduced in proportion) showed increased mutagenicity.Possible explanations for the effect are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
