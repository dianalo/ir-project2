It is conceivablethat avian species consuming such insects could concentrate cadmium intheir tissues. In the work reported here, domesticated honey bees werefound to contain appreciable levels of cadmium. The bees were collectedin quantity and fed to Coturnix quail to study the extent to which anavian species may accumulate cadmium in liver and kidney as well as intheir eggs.</TEXT></DOC>
