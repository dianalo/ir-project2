The 64-31 rollcall represents a personal triumph for the48-year-old national security aide, who saw the same jobelude him in 1987 in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair.A protege of the late CIA Director William Casey, Mr. Gateshas been haunted by the abuses of that period. His challengenow will be to show he has learned from the past and can leadthe agency in the post-Cold War world.</LP><TEXT>   Continued doubts about his credibility could make DefenseSecretary Richard Cheney and National Security Adviser BrentScowcroft more powerful in overseeing U.S. intelligence. Butfriends contend Mr. Gates will move quickly to assert hisindependence and be a voice for the CIA.   &quot;I don't think Cheney will run over him, I don't thinkScowcroft will either,&quot; said Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine).&quot;His challenge will be to reshape that agency, and he willgrow faster than people think.&quot;   A former Soviet analyst and masterful bureaucrat, Mr.Gates is the first career CIA officer to be director innearly two decades. His climb owes much to the loyalties ofSenate Intelligence Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) andPresident Bush, a former CIA director who has been criticizedhimself regarding his performance as vice president duringthe Casey years.   The confirmation process, stretching over four months,became at times a proxy war that touched on Mr. Bush's ownknowledge of the secret war with Nicaragua and U.S. armssales to Iran in the mid-1980s. Loyal Republicans sought tosuppress questions regarding that affair. Mr. Gates also wasquestioned about the CIA's tilt during the same period towardIraqi President Saddam Hussein, in which Mr. Bush also playeda part as a member of the National Security Council.   Sen. Boren's support for Mr. Gates was crucial. Working intandem with Mr. Gates, the Oklahoma conservative privatelycourted senior members in recent weeks. Senate ForeignRelations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), forexample, met separately with Mr. Gates and Sen. Boren, andArmed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) said hisvote to confirm rested largely on Mr. Boren's commitment tothe nominee.   Mr. Nunn's decision doomed any chance that opponents, ledby Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), would succeed. Yet theGeorgia lawmaker voiced discomfort with the choice he hadmade. &quot;I'm not going to pretend I have no doubts,&quot; he said.   Central to these doubts is testimony from Mr. Gates'sformer colleagues that he suppressed dissent within the CIAand tailored intelligence reports to suit Mr. Casey'sconservative agenda. The confirmation hearings offered a rareglimpse of bitter infighting at the CIA.   In his own Senate testimony, Mr. Gates appeared to be aman torn between his background as an intellectual and hispolitical ambitions to rise in the bureaucracy. For example,he told senators with pride of an October 1986 memo in whichhe argued for more sensitivity to changes in Soviet society,yet days later he delivered a controversial speech to advancethe Strategic Defense Initiative.   &quot;Pleasing the boss is this brilliant man Gates'sweakness,&quot; said Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.).</TEXT></DOC>
