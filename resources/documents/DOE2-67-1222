<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-1222 </DOCNO><TEXT>3-D Seismic Gridding is a geophysical technique that converts arbitrarilyoriented 2-D seismic data in an area into a dense, evenly spaced 3-Ddata volume. This technique makes use of apparent dips measured on the2-D lines and reconstructs the three-dimensional structure so that traceinterpolation performed along the structure thereby avoids aliasing.Amplitude of the interpolated trace is obtained from the input data butis weighted by the distance from the input data as well as the semblanceof dip measurements. Unmigrated 2-D data sets are the input, so the regriddeddata can be 3-D migrated. Several examples of 3-D regridded data in theoffshore Gulf of Mexico will be shown and their merits and limitationsare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
