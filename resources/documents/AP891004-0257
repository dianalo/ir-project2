Machinist union members in Seattle, Portland, Ore., Wichita,Kan., and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time,union officials said.   In Seattle on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected whatBoeing said would be its final contract offer.   Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, whojoined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing toconsider resuming negotiations.   But Tom Baker, president of the Machinists' District Lodge 751,said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnightstrike deadline.   Boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote,expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations withsupervisors and non-striking workers.   ``Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and ourintention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,''Boeing said. ``It is impossible to make a general statement on alldefense and space programs since they are at various stages ofdevelopment and production.''   Union leaders said the members were unified and determined toget a better share of Boeing's recent success.   ``I'm pleased that the rank and file are as solid as they areand as united as they are on the issues,'' said Baker, adding theunion would take a dim view of extending the strike deadline.   Baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feelingthat Boeing workers deserved a greater share of the company'srecord prosperity.   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company. We justwant to go through the good times with them as well as the hardtimes,'' Baker said.   Baker left a brief news conference with reporters to go to unionheadquarters where he said he would attend a briefing for picketcaptains.   The rejected offer for the machinists promised an immediateraise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991.   The proposed three-year contract also contained annual bonusesof 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percentthe next, insurance improvements and reduced compulsory overtimerequirements.   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdomejeered the proposed contract and folded summaries of it into paperairplanes which filled the air of the indoor stadium throughout aloud meeting.</TEXT><TEXT>   ``We would certainly have to have more,'' Baker told reportersearlier as the machinists filed toward the podium to vote. ``Wehave told the Boeing Co. what it would take to settle thecontract.''   Boeing's stock rose $3.12{ to $59.75 a share in New York StockExchange trading Tuesday, apparently on expectations that thecontract would be ratified.   Boeing machinists voting in Seattle, Wichita, Kan., Portland,Ore., and elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept thecontract, which required a simple majority, and whether to strike,which required approval by two-thirds of those voting.   The union previously authorized a strike at midnight Tuesday,the same time its three-year contract with Boeing expires.   Baker said he expected the eventual settlement to set a patternfor labor talks throughout the aerospace industry.   Judith Comeau, an aerospace industry analyst for Goldman, Sachsandamp; Co. in New York, said a strike would not be ``a big issue,provided it doesn't go much longer than two weeks.   ``Financially the company is very strong with $3.2 billion incash, $5 billion in equity and $200 million in debts. The impact ofa strike probably won't even be measurable,'' Comeau said.   ``It won't make customers happy because there's already beensome delays in deliveries, especially 747s. Quite simply, they'rejust going to have to wait,'' she said.   Union leaders told the machinists, who last struck Boeing in1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more.   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract thistime you'll never get one,'' said Justin Ostro, general union vicepresident and bargaining coordinator.   ``If you turn tail and run, don't come back in three years''expecting great change, he added. ``There is no good time tostrike. There is only the right time.''   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, isenjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, withcarriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5billion so far this year.   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, BoeingCommercial Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about$70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s.   For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.   Baker said a strike could last ``a week. It could be months.''   He said there was some division among Boeing workers about thebonuses, with veteran employees content to see all compensation intheir paychecks and newer workers preferring the extra check at theend of the year.   The proposed contract also includes a cost-of-living adjustmentthat is 99 percent of actual inflation, which is 17 cents per hourbetter than the present formula.   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 inwestern Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
