CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans are turning against marijuana andgreater sexual freedom. Large majorities of them also favor strongerfamily ties, more emphasis on hard work and less on money.   They especially trust organized religion, and two-thirds aremembers of a church or synagogue. But half think religion is losinginfluence on American life, while a third think it's increasing.   Most think a person can be a good Christian or Jew withoutattending religious services, but 42 percent do so each week. Athird say they have experienced a powerful religious insight orawakening.   And most teen-agers affirm belief in angels.   These are among the varied facets of faith turned up in recentGallup organization polls, and summarized by its Princeton ReligiousResearch Center in its monthly Emerging Trends.   Most of the surveys were among a representative 1,200 or more,with a margin for error of less than 4 percent either way.   One of the most unusual and consistent findings in this age oftechnocracy is that one of every three Americans say they have had a``mystical experience, that is a momemt of sudden religious insightor awakening.''   The center says this ``is one of the least explored, yet one ofthe most fascinating aspects of the spiritual life of Americans,sometimes described as an other-worldy feeling or union with God ora universal spirit.''   The Gallup poll first began exploring the topic in 1962, findingthat 20 percent then reported such experiences. By 1976, theproportion had risen to 31 percent, and has ranged above that since,33 percent in 1988.   ``Such an experience often appears to have a profound effect onthe outlook and direction of a person's life,'' the report says,adding that the experiences are ``more often gradual than sudden.   ``One of the most interesting aspects of these phenomena is thatthey happen to the non-churched and the non-religious as well as topersons ... who say religion plays an important role in theirlives.''   On the drugs and sex issues, the trend is definitely down. Duringthe past 10 years, public acceptance of marijuana has plunged _ from20 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1981 to only 8 percent today.   In the same period, overall public demand for greater sexualfreedom fell from 29 percent in 1978 to 25 percent in 1981 to 22percent today, with the sharpest downturn among young adults,although they still are more likely to espouse it.   Support for stronger family ties, now 94 percent, has remainedclose to that throughout the decade. So has the support for lessemphasis on money, now 67 percent, and for working hard, now 70percent.   Organized religion has for years been rated the most trustedinstitution, although the military momentarily surpassed it in 1986,and still ranks close to it.   The Supreme Court is close behind, with television, organizedlabor and big business at the bottom of the list.   The 65 percent reporting church or synagogue membership is thelowest ever recorded, down from 69 percent the year before. Therecord high was 76 percent in 1947. Attendance, now 42 percent, hitits high in 1955 at 49 percent.   Seventy-six percent of Americans say one can be a good Christianor Jew and not attend religious services, a proportion that haschanged little for the last three decades.   Among U.S. college students, about half of those who have heardof the ``New Age movement'' have an unfavorable view of it, and only14 percent favorable. It is a modern, optimistic mix of Eastern andWestern spiritual ideas.   More teens than ever believe in angels, 74 percent of them, upfrom 64 percent in 1978. At the same time, 29 percent of them saythey believe in witchcraft, up slightly from 25 percent in 1978.   While a majority of teen-agers, more than 70 percent, approve ofinterfaith marriages, the proportion has dropped slightly since1977. But approval of interracial marragies has jumped from 52percent in 1977 to 65 percent now.   Concerning church switchers, the biggest mobility seems to beamong Methodists. Only a third raised as Methodists still identifywith that church. A tenth raised as Roman Catholic no longer claimit.   The findings indicated more stability among other denominations,with Baptists losing some and Presbyterians gaining some, and mostother mainline denominations mostly holding their own.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs June 23</NOTE></DOC>
