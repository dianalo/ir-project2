Implantation energy, dose, and recess depth influence aretheoretically analyzed with the help of a specially developed devicesimulator. The performance of MMIC amplifiers processed with variousenergies, doses, recess depths, and bias conditions is discussed andcompared to experimental characteristics. Some criteria are finally proposedfor the choice of implantation conditions and process in order to optimizethe characteristics of ion-implanted FET's and to realize process-tolerantMMIC amplifiers.</TEXT></DOC>
