The guerrillas admitted that bombing by communist troops hamperedtheir advance on Jalalabad, but they claimed to have shot down fiveairplanes and killed more than 100 government soldiers in the lasttwo days. They reported heavy civilian casualties from the bombing.   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, saidgovernment air and ground forces repulsed the guerrillas after theyfired 5,000 rockets and shells in an attempt to take the city ineastern Afghanistan.   It said that over the previous 24 hours, 560 guerrillas andsupporters were killed and 252 were wounded. It said the deadincluded four Americans, a Saudi national, and some Pakistanis.   Pakistan, the United States and Saudi Arabia back the Moslemguerrillas in their war with the communist government but denyhaving any nationals fighting in Afghanistan.   The battle for Jalalabad, 42 miles from the Pakistan border, isthe first test of strength of Kabul's communist rulers and theiropponents since the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan on Feb. 15.   Its fall would be a blow to the morale of the mainly conscriptedarmy and a big boost to the guerrillas, who have been fighting 10years to establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.   Observers believe a guerrilla victory could have a domino effecton the country's other communist-held cities, including Kabul, thecapital.   The guerrillas began their offensive March 6 and by last weekendhad captured the communist garrison at Samarkhel, six miles east ofJalababad.   The communists retaliated with heavy, high-altitude aerialbombing.   ``The (air) forces are taking a direct part in defending thecountry and demolishing the gathering place of the invaders. ...This success worried the enemy, and they are thinking: `These arenot Afghan pilots,''' Radio Kabul said Wednesday night.   Guerrillas have claimed the fighter-bombers are piloted bySoviets in violation of the U.N.-mediated accord that provided forthe Soviet withdrawal.   Despite communist claims, guerrilla sources say they have lostonly about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700government troops.   Government and guerrilla versions of the fighting usuallycontradict and tend to be exaggerated.   However, journalists and witnesses have reported the battle forJalalabad has sent hundreds of wounded guerrillas and thousands ofcivilians over the border into Pakistan.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents also wereattacking communist posts around the northern city of Baghlan andthe southeastern city of Kandahar, the country's second-largest.   It said attacks near Baghlan on Monday killed 70 communisttroops, wounded 50 and destroyed five tanks.</TEXT></DOC>
