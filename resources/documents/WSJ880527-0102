Toshiba's unconsolidated, or parent-company, pretax profit surged 58%, to 65.06 billion yen ($523.3 million) from 41.20 billion yen a year earlier. Net income rose 56%, to 37.04 billion yen from 23.70 billion yen. Sales rose 7.2%, to a record 2.683 trillion yen ($21.58 billion) from 2.503 trillion yen.    A Toshiba official said the results reflected substantial cost reductions and surging domestic demand for consumer products. He added that profit rose despite an estimated 16% drop in export sales to North America, to 210 billion yen from 250 billion yen, because of fallout from a Toshiba affiliate's sales of militarily sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union and U.S. semiconductor tariffs imposed on Japanese chip exporters for alleged violations of a bilateral accord.    World-wide exports of consumer products fell 20% because of stiff competition from newly industrialized countries and the yen's strength, officials said. But overall export sales rose 7%, to 775.84 billion yen from 726.84 billion yen, accounting for 29% of all sales.    At Hitachi, unconsolidated pretax profit rose 56%, to 138.74 billion yen from 89.11 billion yen a year earlier, with the help of extensive cost reductions. Net income grew 22%, to 65.14 billion yen from 53.31 billion yen, while sales slipped to 2.920 trillion yen from 2.925 trillion yen.    Export sales slumped 9%, to 772.17 billion yen from 845.38 billion yen, because of adverse currency factors and competition from newly industrialized countries. Strong domestic demand countered this decline. </TEXT></DOC>
