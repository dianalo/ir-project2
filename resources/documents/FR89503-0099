Based on our July 13, 1988 decision that the subject merchandise constitutesfive separate classes or kinds of merchandise, the exports of the respondentcompanies fall under only one class or kind of merchandise subject to theseinvestigations. However, since import statistics collected by the Departmentindicated that Thailand had exported products under basket <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) categoriesthat might include bearings in the four class  or kind categories otherthan ball bearings and parts thereof, our preliminary determinations appliedto all classes or kinds of merchandise listed in Appendix A attached to<T3>AFBs from the FRG. </T3>During verification we found that the onlyclass or kind of merchandise exported from Thailand was ball bearings andparts thereof.

We conducted verificationin Thailand from December 6-16, 1988, of the questionnaire responses ofthe Government of Thailand (GOT), NMB Thai Limited (NMB) and Pelmec ThaiLimited (Pelmec). Respondents submitted amended responses clarifying informationand correcting certain minor errors found at verification on February 14,17, and 27, 1989.On August 31, 1988, the petitioner filed a request pursuant to section705(a)(1) of the Act to postpone the final determinations to coincide withthe final determinations in the concurrent antidumping investigations.The postponement notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 29, 1988 (53 FR 38049). We subsequentlyreceived requests from the petitioner and all respondents in the antidumpinginvestigations pursuant to sections 735(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Act topostpone the final determinations in the antidumping investigations untilMarch 24, 1989. The postponement notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 8, 1988 (53 FR 49581). Accordingly,the final determinations in these investigations were also postponed untilMarch 24, 1989. Pursuant to section 705(a)(1) of the Act and in keeping with Article 5,Paragraph 3 of the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of ArticlesVI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the SubsidiesCode), we terminated suspension of liquidation on all five classes or kindsof merchandise as of January 4, 1989, 120 days after the date of publicationof the <T3>Preliminary Determinations. </T3>Both petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in these investigations.Petitioner and respondents filed pre-hearing briefs on January 27 and February9, 1989. A public hearing was held on February 10, 1989. Petitioner fileda post-hearing brief on February 21, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate TSUSA item number(s) and theappropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions for convenienceand Customs purposes. The Department's written description of the productsunder investigation remains dispositive as to the scope of the productscovered by these investigations. The products covered by these investigations constitute five separate ``classesor kinds'' of bearings, as outlined in Appendix A attached to <T3>AFBs from the FRG. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Injury Determination </ITAG>Since Thailand is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaningof section 701(b) of the Act, section 303 of the Act applies to these investigations.However, Thailand is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, and certain products included in the scope of the ball bearingsinvestigation may enter under non-dutiable TSUSA categories (<T3>i.e., </T3>those classified under TSUSA items 681.1010, 681.1030, 681.3900,and 692.3295). Therefore, in accordance with section 303(a)(2), the ITCis required to determine whether imports of these nondutiable productsfrom Thailand materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S.industry. If the ITC determines that imports of ball bearings classifiedunder these four TSUSA items materially injure, or threaten material injuryto, a U.S. industry, we will amend our countervailing duty order to includeball bearings classified under these TSUSA categories and will direct theU.S. Customs Service to resume suspension of liquidation on all entriesof ball bearings from Thailand under these categories that are enteredor withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after the date of publicationof our amended countervailing duty order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>For purposes of these final determinations, the period for which we aremeasuring bounties or grants (``the review period'') October 1, 1986 toSeptember 30, 1987, which corresponds to the fiscal year of the respondentcompanies. Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires,verification, and written comments filed by petitioner and respondents,we determine the following: I. Programs Determined to Confer Bounties or Grants We determine that bounties or grants are being provided to manufacturers,producers, or exporters in Thailand of ball bearings under the followingprograms: <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Short-Term Loans Provided Under the Export Packing Credits Program</ITAG>Export packing credits (EPCs) are short-term loans used for either pre-shipmentor post-shipment financing. Exporters apply to commercial banks for EPCs.The commercial banks, in turn, must submit an application for approvalto the Bank of Thailand (BOT). Under the ``Regulations Governing the Purchaseof Promissory Notes Arising from Exports'' (B. E. 2528), effective January2, 1986, the BOT repurchases promissory notes issued by creditworthy exportersthrough commercial banks. To qualify for the repurchase arrangement, promissorynotes must be supported by a letter of credit, sales contract, purchaseorder, usance bill or warehouse receipt. The notes are available for upto 180 days, and interest is paid on the due date of the loan rather thanthe date of receipt. The BOT charges an interest rate of five percent per annum to commercialbanks on repurchased packing credits issued in connection with exportsof goods specified in categories one and two of the ``Notification of theBoard of Investment No. 40/2521.'' The commercial banks are permitted tocharge exporters no more than seven percent per annum for the purchaseof such notes. For goods other than those listed in categories one andtwo, such as bearings, the repurchase and purchase rates are four percentand seven percent, respectively. At verification we found that, on the due date of the loan, the BOT debitsthe commercial bank's account for the principal amount and the four percentinterest charged the commercial bank. If the terms of the loan are notmet, the BOT charges the commercial bank a penalty, retroactive to thefirst day of the loan, at an eight percent interest rate.Similarly, on the due date of the loan, the commercial bank debits theexporter's account for the principal amount and the maximum of seven percentinterest charged the exporter. If the exporter has not met the terms ofthe loan, the commercial bank passes on the additional eight percent penaltycharge over the term of the loan. The penalty is refunded to the commercial bank by the BOT and by the commercialbank to the exporter if the company can prove shipment of the goods tookplace within 60 days after the due date (in the case of pre-shipment loans),or the foreign currency was received within 60 days after the due date(in the case of post-shipment loans). Otherwise, the penalty is not refunded.The purpose of the penalty charge is to ensure that companies take outEPC loans only to finance actual export sales. On October 1, 1988, the GOT issued new regulations that coexisted withthe prior regulations until December 31, 1988. On January 1, 1989, thenew regulations completely replaced the former ones. Until January l, 1989,exporters could still receive EPC loans under the terms of the programdescribed above. Under the new regulations, the maximum rate commercialbanks can charge exporters was raised from seven to 10 percent. In addition,the BOT now rediscounts only up to 50 percent of the loan amount, whereasunder the previous program the BOT could rediscount the full value of theloan. We verified that both NMB and Pelmec received and paid interest on EPCloans for exports of ball bearings during the review period and that allpenalty payments charged were subsequently refunded. Because only exportersare eligible for these loans, we determine that they are countervailableto the extent that they are provided at preferential rates. As the benchmark for short-term loans, it is our practice to use the nationalaverage commercial interest rate or the most comparable, predominant formof short-term financing. For purposes of these determinations, we are usingthe weighted-average interest rate charged by commercial banks on domesticloans, bills and overdrafts during 1987, and, where loans were issued in1986, the weighted-average interest rate of the same composition for 1986.This is the benchmark that we have applied in all previous Thai cases,most recently in <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Malleable Iron Pipe Fittings from Thailand, </T3>54 FR 6439,February 10, 1989 (<T3>Pipe Fittings</T3>). The data used to calculate these weighted-average interest rates was verifiedat the BOT. Comparing the weighted-average interest rates for 1986 and1987 to the rate charged on EPCs, we find that the rate on EPCs is preferentialand, therefore, confers bounties or grants on exports of ball bearings.To calculate the benefit from the EPC loans on which interest was paidduring the review period, we followed the short-term loan methodology whichhas been applied consistently in our past determinations and which is describedin more detail in the <T3>Subsidies Appendix </T3>attached to the notice of <T3>Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order</T3>(49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984); <T3>see also, Alhambra Foundry v. United States, </T3>626 F. Supp. 402(CIT, 1985). We compared the amount of interest actually paid during the review periodto the amount that would have been paid at the benchmark rate. Becausewe verified that the EPC loans received by NMB and Pelmec covered shipmentsto more than one destination, we included all EPC loans on which interestwas paid during the review period. We calculated the amount of interestthat would have been paid at the benchmark rate and subtracted the amountof interest that was actually paid. We then divided the result by the respondents'total export sales during the review period. The estimated net bounty orgrant is 1.42 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Tax Certificates for Exports </ITAG>Under the ``Tax and Duty Compensation of Exported Goods Produced in theKingdom Act'' (Tax and Duty Act), the GOT issues tax certificates to exportersof record to rebate indirect taxes and import duties levied on inputs intoexported products. The rebate rates under the Tax and Duty Act are computedon the basis of an input/output (I/O) study initially published in 1980,based on 1975 data, and updated in 1985 using 1980 data. Using the I/Ostudy's input structure table, the Thai Ministry of Finance (MOF) computesthe value of total inputs (both imports and local purchases) at ex-factoryprices. The MOF then calculates two rebate rates: the ``A'' rate and the``B'' rate. The ``A'' rate rebates import duties and business and municipal taxes onboth imported and domestically purchased inputs. The ``B'' rate rebatesonly the business and municipal taxes passed through on domestically purchasedinputs, and is used by exporters that receive import duty exemptions ordrawbacks under other programs. The ``A'' or ``B'' rate, as appropriate,is then applied to the total FOB value of exports in the I/O sector todetermine the amount of the rebate. Under the Tax and Duty Act, the rebates are paid to companies through taxcertificates which can be used to pay other tax liabilities. These taxcertificates can also be transferred to other companies which can use themto pay their tax liabilities. The rebate rates in effect during the review period were announced on February5, 1986, in the Notification of the Committee on Tax Rebates, No. Or. 1/2529.The calculation of these rates was based on an updated study completedin 1982. For exports of ball bearings under Customs Cooperative CouncilNomenclature (CCCN) category 84.62, the ``A'' rate is 7.19 percent andthe ``B'' rate is 0.59 percent. We verified that both NMB and Pelmec received tax certificates at the ``B''rate. To determine whether an indirect tax rebate system confers a bounty orgrant, we must apply the following analysis. First, we examine whetherthe system is intended to operate as a rebate of both indirect taxes andimport duties. Second, we analyze whether the GOT properly ascertainedthe level of the rebate. This includes a review of the sample used in thestudy, including the documentation and the accuracy of the informationgathered from the sample on input coefficients, import prices and ratesof duty on imported inputs, the ratio of imported inputs to domesticallyproduced inputs (when, for a given imported input, there is also domesticproduction of the input), and the exchange rates used to convert importprices denominated in a foreign currency to the local currency. Third,we review whether the rebate schedules are revised periodically. When the I/O study upon which the indirect tax and import duty rebate systemis based meets these three conditions, the Department will consider thatthe system does not confer a bounty or grant if the amount rebated forduties and indirect taxes on physically incorporated inputs does not exceedthe fixed amount set forth in the rebate schedule for the exported product.When the system rebates duties and indirect taxes on both physically incorporatedand non-physically incorporated inputs, we find that a bounty or grantexists to the extent that the fixed rebate exceeds the allowable rebateon physically incorporated inputs. Applying our three-part analysis to the facts of this investigation, wefound that the taxes and duties eligible for rebate under the Tax and DutyAct include those on materials, equipment, spare parts and machinery usedin the production of exports. Direct taxes such as income tax and taxeswhich are otherwise refundable or exempt are excluded from the rebate.Thus, the program operates to rebate indirect taxes and import duties.The information obtained during verification on the methodology and samplingused in calculating the rebate rates based on the revised I/O study leadsus to conclude that the GOT employed a reasonable methodology for establishingthe rebate levels. Furthermore, after a thorough examination of the methodologiesemployed in revising the 1975 I/O study and in calculating new rebate ratesbased on the revised study, we find that the GOT has a system in placeto periodically update the rebate schedules. Although the rebate under the Tax and Duty Act meets the three conditionsrequired for indirect tax rebate systems not to be considered a bountyor grant, the inputs itemized in the GOT's calculations include both physicallyincorporated items as well as non-physically incorporated items. Sincethe indirect tax on non-physically incorporated items is also includedin the GOT's rebate rate calculation, we must determine the extent to whichthe rebate rates confer an excessive remission of indirect taxes. We havereviewed the documentation and printouts submitted by the GOT in its responseand at verification showing a detailed calculation of the rebate rates.Under the Tax and Duty Act, these calculations itemize the inputs and listex-factory prices, import values, import duties and taxes, and domesticindirect taxes. Based on verified information, we calculated the indirect tax incidenceon physically incorporated inputs at FOB prices according to the most recentGOT rebate rate calculation. We then subtracted the percentage of indirecttax incidence attributable to physically incorporated inputs from the authorizedrebate rate. Using this methodology, the overrebate on the ``B'' rate applicableto NMB and Pelmec is 0.49 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Electricity Discounts for Exporters </ITAG>The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the MetropolitanElectricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)administer discounts on electricity rates charged producers of export products.These discounts represent approximately 20 percent of total electricitycosts and are available to any company eligible for and receiving tax certificates.Once the export transactions have been completed, the exporter may applyfor the discount by presenting to the electricity authority from whichit receives its electricity bill the appropriate documents to verify thatexport shipments have been made. The discount is calculated based on therebate rate in effect during that year for that company and appears asa credit on a subsequent electricity bill. We verified that NMB received electricity discounts during the review periodbased on its export shipments. Because these discounts are available onlyto exporters, we determine that they are countervailable.We allocated the discounts received over the total value of respondents'export sales during the review period to obtain an estimated net bountyor grant of 0.25 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">D. Tax and Duty Exemptions Under the Investment Promotion Act (IPA):Sections 28, 36(1) and 31</ITAG>The IPA of 1977 provides incentives for investment to promote developmentof the Thai economy. The IPA is administered by the Board of Investment(BOI) through promotion certificates. These certificates list the varioussections of the IPA under which a company is eligible to receive benefits.We verified that the certificates are applied for and granted on a case-by-casebasis.Section 28 of the IPA provides an exemption from payment of import dutiesand business and municipal taxes on machinery and equipment. Section 36(1)provides an exemption from payment of duties and taxes on raw and ``essential''materials used in the production of exports. At verification we found thatrespondents did not use the exemptions available under section 36(1) withrespect to raw materials physically incorporated in exports because theseraw materials enter duty free through their bonded warehouses. Section31 provides a three- to eight-year exemption from payment of corporateincome taxes on profits derived from promoted activities, as well as deductionsfrom net profits for losses incurred during the tax exemption period. Weverified that NMB and Pelmec received exemptions under these three sectionsof the IPA during the review period.At verification we found that the certificates granted NMB and Pelmec arelabeled ``export'' certificates, meaning that benefits under the IPA sectionslisted in them are predicated on export performance. The BOI examines anumber of criteria and conditions including the supply and demand conditionsin the Thai and overseas markets. For companies in ``Production or Assemblyof Electronics'' (the industrial category under which bearing producersqualify for IPA benefits), the BOI has found that new projects will notbe viable unless the companies are able to sell overseas. Accordingly,the BOI places a requirement on such companies that their products be ``largelyor fully exported.'' We therefore determine that, for purposes of theseinvestigations, the benefits received by NMB and Pelmec under IPA sections28, 36(1) and 31 are countervailable.Under our tax methodology, we calculated the difference between the amounteach company paid in income taxes with the section 31 exemption duringthe review period (<T3>i.e., </T3>zero) and the amount each would have paid during the reviewperiod absent the exemption. We then added these tax savings to the totalduty and tax exemptions for machinery and ``essential'' materials receivedby each company under IPA sections 28 and 36(1) during the review period,and divided the result by the respondents' total export sales during thereview period. On this basis, we calculated an estimated net bounty orgrant of 19.38 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>II. Program Determined Not To Confer Bounties or GrantsWe determine that bounties or grants are not being provided to manufacturers,producers or exporters in Thailand of ball bearings under the followingprogram:<ITAG tagnum="81">IPA Section 34</ITAG>Section 34 of the IPA states that dividends derived from a promoted activityshall be granted an exemption from computation of taxable income. Thisexemption is applicable throughout the period in which the company issuingthe dividends receives an exemption from corporate income tax under section31. According to Thai tax law, dividends are distributed from after-taxincome; the distributor withholds an additional dividend tax. Section 34exempts NMB and Pelmec from withholding this tax on dividends when theyissue dividends to their foreign parent company. Because the section 34exemption applies to withholding taxes on dividends, and the dividendsare paid by respondents to their foreign parent, the taxes are on the parent'sdividend income, and the exemption bestows no benefit on respondents. TheDepartment has consistently found that dividend tax exemptions for non-residentshareholders do not confer a countervailable benefit. See <T3>Final Results of Administrative Review: Bicycle Tires and Tubes fromKorea </T3>(48 FR 32205, July 14, 1983) and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and Orders: CertainTextile Mill Products and Apparel from Sri Lanka </T3>(50 FR 9826, March12, 1985).III. Programs Determined Not To Be UsedWe determine, based on verified information, that manufacturers, producersor exporters in Thailand of ball bearings did not apply for, claim or receivebenefits during the review period for exports of ball bearings to the UnitedStates under the following programs, which were listed in the Notice ofInitiation (53 FR 15086, April 27, 1988):<ITAG tagnum="15">A. </ITAG><T3>Rediscount of Industrial Bills</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">B. </ITAG><T3>International Trade Promotion Fund</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">C. </ITAG><T3>Export Processing Zones</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">D. </ITAG><T3>Reduced Business Taxes for Producers of Intermediate Goods for ExportIndustries</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">E. </ITAG><T3>Tax Exemptions for Goodwill and Royalty Payments under Section 33 ofthe IPA</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">F. </ITAG><T3>Double Deduction of Foreign Marketing Expenses under Section 36(4)of the IPA</T3>For a complete description of these programs, see the <T3>Preliminary Determinations.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>Petitioner's allegation that ``critical circumstances'' exist in theseinvestigations is based on aggregated TSUSA categories. However, all merchandiseimported under the categories specified by petitioner in its allegation,with the exception of TSUSA items 681.1010 and 681.1030, is dutiable, andunder section 303 of the Act, dutiable merchandise cannot be subject toa critical circumstances determination. <T3>See </T3>19 U.S.C. 1303(b)(3). For the non-dutiable TSUSA categories 681.1010 and 681.1030, U.S. importstatistics show that there have been no imports from Thailand in 1987 or1988. However, there were imports from Thailand under two other non-dutiablebasket TSUSA categories, which were not included in petitioner's criticalcircumstances allegation but which are included in the product scope ofball bearings and parts thereof (see Appendix A attached to <T3>Bearings from the FRG</T3>). Therefore, we examined whether criticalcircumstances exist with respect to entries under these two categories.In determining whether critical circumstances exist within the meaningof section 703(e)(1) of the Act, we must examine whether there is a reasonablebasis to believe or suspect that: (1) the alleged subsidy is inconsistentwith the Agreement, and (2) there have been massive imports of the subjectmerchandise over a relatively short period. In determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time, we consider the following factors: (1) the volume and valueof the imports; (2) seasonal trends; and (3) the share of domestic consumptionaccounted for by the imports. In making this determination our preferenceis to examine company-specific shipment data on exports to the United Statesof the subject merchandise. However, respondents cannot segregate theirdata to show which merchandise, if any, entered under the non-dutiableTSUSA categories. Moreover, it is not feasible within the statutory deadlinefor the Department to determine with certainty the TSUSA categories underwhich shipments of ball bearings from Thailand are classified. Therefore,for purposes of this investigation, we examined import statistics for thetwo basket TSUSA categories under which there were entries from Thailandto determine whether there have been massive imports over a relativelyshort period. Imports from Thailand under category 681.3900 in 1988 weresix percent of what they were in 1987, and imports from Thailand undercategory 692.3295 were lower in the three months following the filing ofthe petition than in the three months preceding its filing. Since we have not found massive imports over a relatively short periodof time, we do not need to consider whether the alleged subsidies are inconsistentwith the Agreement. Therefore, we determine that critical circumstancesdo not exist. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner argues that there should be only one classor kind of merchandise, rather than five classes or kinds of merchandise,because respondents could circumvent a countervailing duty order coveringonly one class or kind of bearings by exporting one or more of the otherfour classes or kinds to the United States. Respondents argue that, sincethey export only ball bearings to the United States, the Department shouldissue negative final determinations with respect to the other four classesor kinds of bearings. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Petitioner has not presented us with informationthat would cause us to reconsider our June 5, 1988 decision in which wedivided the bearings under investigation into five classes or kinds. (Fora more complete discussion of our class or kind determination, see AppendixB attached to <T3>AFBs from the FRG.</T3>) At verification we found that the only typeof bearings produced by respondents are ball bearings and parts thereof,and that there are no exports from Thailand of any of the other four classesor kinds of merchandise. Because we verified that there are no exportsof the other four classes or kinds of merchandise, we are limiting ouraffirmative countervailing duty determination to ball bearings, and issuingnegative determinations with respect to the other four classes or kinds.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Respondents argue that we should treat certain salesmade to a third country that are subsequently reimported into Thailandas export sales for purposes of the countervailing duty investigations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We are treating these sales as export sales forpurposes of the countervailing duty investigations because they benefitfrom export subsidies and are included in the export statistics of Thailand.Furthermore, these sales are treated as export sales by respondents. <T3>Comment 3: </T3>Respondents note that the value of the subject merchandiseentering the United States is greater than the sales revenue received bythe companies in Thailand due to a net mark-up imposed by the parent company,located in a third country, through which the merchandise is invoiced.Respondents argue that if the net mark-up is not added to the denominator,a distortion in the bounty or grant rate will result, since the rate isimposed as a percentage of the value of the merchandise entering the UnitedStates. Petitioner states that the mark-up should not be included in thedenominator. <T3>DOC Position: </T3> We do not consider it appropriate to incorporatemark-ups or mark-downs levied in a third country in calculating our netbounty or grant rates because the bounties or grants were received basedon the value of respondents' sales as exported from Thailand. We are thereforeusing this value as our denominator. <T3>Comment 4: </T3>Respondents argue that their bonded warehouse-to-bondedwarehouse sales should be added to the denominator for purposes of calculatingbenefits under the IPA, since these sales are considered export sales forpurposes of receiving benefits under the IPA. Petitioner argues that thesesales should not be added to the denominator because (1) they were originallyreported in the questionnaire response as domestic sales, and (2) thereis no proof that they were eventually exported out of the country. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We are not treating these sales as export salesfor purposes of any of the programs under investigation, including benefitsreceived under the IPA. We have made this decision in order to avoid possibledouble counting of sales. Respondents raised this issue at verificationand have provided us with no information to demonstrate that these salesdo not include sales between the two respondents' bonded warehouses. Sincethese sales may include sales between the two respondents which were subsequentlyexported by one of them, such sales could be double counted against respondents'export sales. Furthermore, the fact that merchandise is placed in a bonded warehousedoes not automatically mean that the merchandise will be subsequently exported.Merchandise can be subsequently removed from the bonded warehouse for domesticconsumption, provided that appropriate duties are paid. <T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner argues that we should use for our benchmark,as best information available, rates published by <T3>Financing Foreign Operations </T3>(FFO) and the International MonetaryFund (IMF), which ranged ``between 12_15 percent,'' because BOT officialswere not able to answer certain questions at verification. Petitioner statesthat these rates ``averaged approximately 15 percent'' and that we shoulduse 15 percent as our benchmark. Respondents argue that we should use a company-specific benchmark because``the companies have demonstrated access to short-term commercial loansat interest rates equal to, or lower than, the allegedly, ``preferential''interest rates offered by the EPC program.'' They state that the assumptionswhich ``underlie Commerce's use of a nationwide benchmark in determiningwhether to countervail short-term loans...are not supported by the factsverified in this investigation.'' <T3>DOC Position: </T3>As stated in section I.A., it is our practice touse as our benchmark for short-term loans the national average commercialinterest rate or the most comparable, predominant form of short-term financing.Petitioner has not provided any information showing that the rates it citesrepresent the most comparable, predominant form of short-term financingin Thailand. Moreover, these rates, as the FFO publication provided bypetitioner shows, are rates that were in effect as of the end of August1986, and are thus irrelevant with respect to respondents' EPC loans onwhich interest was paid during the review period, since the vast majorityof these loans were taken out after August 1986. With respect to the IMFdata, petitioner did not specify which rates it considered appropriate;based on our review of the IMF rates, there is nothing that indicates thatthese rates are more reflective of short-term commercial rates than thenational average rate provided by respondents. Although BOT officials werenot able to answer all of our questions at verification, we were able toverify the information used to construct the national average benchmarkrate provided in the response. As for respondents' argument, the facts verified in this investigationindicate that the commercial loans received by respondents are not comparableto their EPC loans because the EPC loans are for significantly longer timeperiods than the commercial loans. Assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>that we should consider a company-specific benchmark,it would therefore be inappropriate to base such a benchmark on these commercialloans. <T3>Comment 6: </T3>Respondents make two arguments concerning the subsequentlyrefunded penalty payments assessed on the companies' EPC loans. The firstargument is that, since the penalty charge tips the interest on the loanover the benchmark rate, the borrower does not know whether he has receivedthe preferential EPC rate net of penalties until the penalty is refunded.Respondents therefore argue that all loans for which penalties were refundedafter the review period should not be counted. The second argument is thatinterest lost due to the penalty charges should be subtracted from thebenefit calculated for the program. Petitioner argues that penalty payments should not be taken into accountbecause they are not a permissable offset under section 771(6) of the Act.Petitioner adds that respondents' first argument should not be acceptedbecause respondents failed to incorporate the other side of the coin byproviding information on loans with interest paid prior to the review periodfor which penalty refunds were made during the review period. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner concerning respondents'first argument. Because respondents did not provide any information onthose loans with interest paid before the review period for which penaltieswere refunded during the review period, we have not excluded loans withpenalties refunded after the review period from our calculation of thebenefit for this program. With regard to respondents' second argument,they raised this issue at verification and have provided no informationto demonstrate that the companies actually lost interest on the penaltypayments from the time these payments were debited from their accountsuntil the time the payments were refunded. Claims of lost interest aretherefore speculative and have not been taken into account.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Respondents argue that if they did not receive an exemptionfrom corporate income tax under section 31 of the IPA or an exemption fromindirect taxes and duties on machinery, machine parts and ``consummables''(lubricants and other items used with the machines) under sections 28 and36(1) of the IPA, they would be allowed to deduct the indirect taxes andduties paid on consummables on their corporate income tax returns. Theytherefore suggest that we should perform the following calculation to avoiddouble counting: (1) obtain the difference  between the income tax theywould have paid with the deduction and the tax they would have paid withoutthe deduction; and (2) subtract this difference from the total indirecttax and duty exemptions received under sections 28 and 36(1). Petitioner argues that benefits received under sections 28 and 36(1) shouldbe calculated separately from benefits received under section 31. Petitionermakes two arguments: (1) section 776(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671(6))makes no mention of double counting in allowing the Department to offseta gross subsidy, and (2) benefits the respondents would have received underone of these IPA sections absent the others are ``speculative.'' <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner. It is not our policy toconsider the tax consequences of a subsidy when calculating the benefitof that subsidy. Such tax consequences are a secondary effect that cannotbe considered a valid offset under section 771(6) of the Act. (<T3>See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: OilCountry Tubular Goods from Canada, </T3>51 FR 15037, April 22, 1986.) Furthermore,such tax consequences would be speculative (<T3>see id</T3>). <T3>Comment 8: </T3>Respondents argue that the Department should accountfor a program-wide change regarding benefits received under IPA section31 due to a drop in the corporate income tax rate from 40 to 35 percent.They state that we should calculate the benefit for duty deposit purposesby taking 35 percent of their taxable income from their tax returns filedduring the review period and allocate the result over their review periodsales. Petitioner argues that there should not be a program-wide change becausethe amount of the benefit based on the change is ``unclear.'' <T3>DOC Position: </T3>At verification we found that the corporate taxrate applicable to respondents was reduced from 40 to 35 percent, effectiveJanuary 1, 1986. We confirmed that the new rate was first applied to respondents'tax returns filed after the review period (which were based on their fiscalyear beginning in 1986) by examining their returns filed during and afterthe review period. The actual effect of this program-wide change can onlybe measured by taking 35 percent of respondents' taxable income from theirtax returns filed after the review period and allocating the result overtheir sales from the same period. However, we are unable to measure theeffect of the change because respondents did not provide us with informationregarding their post-review period sales. We therefore based our estimatednet duty deposit rate for this program on the estimated net bounty or grantrate calculated for the review period. <T3>Comment 9: </T3>Respondents argue that benefits received under IPAsection 34 do not bestow a bounty or grant because it is the non-residentshareholders and not the respondent companies that are ultimately liablefor the dividend tax. Petitioner argues that benefits received under section34 do bestow a bounty or grant because ``the amount of the dividends paidis exempt from the * * * corporate tax rate.'' <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents. See section II, above.We note that petitioner's understanding of section 34 is incorrect. Thesection 34 exemption is applicable throughout the period in which the companyissuing the dividends receives an exemption from corporate income tax undersection 3l. It would therefore not make sense to exempt the amount of dividendspaid from the corporate tax rate. <T3>Comment 10: </T3>Petitioner argues that the GOT's I/O study on whichour analysis of the Tax Certificates for Exports program is based is outof date. Petitioner states that we should countervail the entire rebaterate of 0.59 percent received by respondents as ``best information available.''Respondents argue that the I/O study, which covers a broad spectrum ofindustries, is updated periodically, and that we should continue to baseour analysis on it, as we have done in all previous Thai cases. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents. The I/O study is a macroeconomicstudy and has, as respondents indicate, been accepted in all previous Thaiinvestigations, most recently in <T3>Pipe Fittings. </T3>Moreover, as stated in section I.B., we verifiedthe validity of the I/O study during the current investigations. The GOTupdated the I/O study in 1985, using 1980 data, for all the output sectors,including the one under which bearings are classified. We have thereforeused this study to assess the extent to which overrebates were given underthe Tax Certificates for Exports program.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Petitioner argues that the tax incidence on sector087 (paints and varnishes) should not be considered because paints andvarnishes are not physically incorporated in bearings. Respondents arguethat, in calculating the tax rebate on physically incorporated items, boththe numerator and denominator must have the same product coverage. Sincethe denominator covers the total output of the sector into which bearingsfall (sector 111), the numerator should therefore encompass the tax incidenceon all inputs which are physically incorporated in any of the finishedproducts included in this sector, as opposed to just the tax incidenceon all inputs physically incorporated in bearings. Thus, for example, althoughpaints and varnishes may not be physically incorporated in bearings, theyare physically incorporated in other sector 111 products. Petitioner rebutsrespondents by stating that the Department would have to ``conduct a physicalincorporation verification for each of the products in the sector,'' atask which it is not mandated to perform. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner. Section 776(b) of theAct requires that the Department shall verify all information relied uponin making a final determination. Respondents provided no information atverification to demonstrate what the physically incorporated inputs arein relation to the entire output of sector 111. We have therefore basedour determination of the overrebate received by respondents on verifiedinformation by comparing the rebate rate received to the average incidenceof indirect taxes on inputs physically incorporated in bearings only. <T3>Comment 12: </T3>A number of interested parties have questioned petitioner'sstanding in all the countervailing duty and antidumping duty investigationspertaining to antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings).We have determined that petitioner had standing to bring the investigationwith regard to ball bearings. For a description of their arguments andthe Department's position, see Appendix B attached to <T3>AFBs from the FRG. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determinations.
