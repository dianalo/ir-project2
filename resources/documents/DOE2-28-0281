The focus of the study was on smalland medium-sized systems which link up to 20 to 30 sites to a centralheating plant rather than of large municipal district heating systems.Several hundred group central heating systems are currently in placeat hospitals, universities etc. These systems are almost all steam-basedand facing increasing scrutiny as to their cost effectiveness. The recentdecline of heavy oil prices has been particularly large and gas pricesfor very large volume users have dropped to remain competitive. Woodwaste is available at very low cost at many sites and wood chip supplysystems are starting to emerge. A growing base of experience with biomassfuelled units in 200 kW to 5 MW range provides the evidence that appropriatelysized units can serve as base load boilers at many potential sites. Interestin the incineration of municipal waste is growing rapidly. The Swedishemission standards are being recognized. Experience with small and medium-sized(200 kWe to 20 MWe) cogeneration systems is limited. Applications forheat pump technologies are seen to be more selective. In Canada steamhas been the predominant medium for the distribution of thermal loadsand there is little awareness in the engineering community of the costeffectiveness of hot water systems. Overall the market potential forgroup heating systems in Canada is quite large. Of particular note areopportunities to retrofit central plants in the 5 MW to 20 MW range,improve efficiency in existing steam distribution systems and developlarger base loads for systems supplied by either biomass or conventionalfuels.</TEXT></DOC>
