L. 99-514; 100 Stat. 2085). <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>Section 6050M requires the head of every Federal executive agency to filean information return with the Internal Revenue Service setting forth thename, address and TIN of each person with which that agency enters intoa contract, as well as any other information prescribed under Treasuryregulations. The information returns filed under section 6050M will beused as a source of information to collect delinquent Federal tax liabilitiesof persons who enter into contracts with Federal executive agencies. In addition to the information specifically required by section 6050M,the proposed rules require other information that will facilitate the collectionof delinquent Federal tax liabilities to be reported to the Internal RevenueService. Included in the category of additional items are the expecteddate of completion of the contract as determined under any reasonable method(such as the expected contract delivery date under the contract schedule)and the total amount obligated under the contract action. The proposed rules define the term ``contract'' to mean an obligation ofa Federal executive agency to make payment of money (or other property)to a person in return for the sale of property, the rendering of services,or other consideration. The term ``contract'', however, does not includea license granted by a Federal executive agency, an obligation of a contractor(other than a Federal executive agency) to subcontractor, a debt instrumentof the United States Government or of a Federal agency, or an obligationof a Federal executive agency to lend money, lease propoerty to a lessee,or sell property. Pursuant to the authority of section 6050M (d), it is proposed that contractsor contract actions for which the amount obligated is $25,000 or less donot have to be reported. Because the propose of section 6050M is to providethe Internal Revenue Service with a source of information for collection,certain categories of contracts that will be of minimal use for this purposeare proposed to be excluded from the reporting requirements. Contractswith another Federal governmental unit or with a foreign, state, or localgovernment (or an agency or instrumentality thereof) would not have tobe reported. Additionally, no reporting would be required for any contractthe terms of which provide that all amounts payable under the contractby any Federal executive agency will be paid within the 120 days followingthe date of the contract action, and for which it is reasonable to expectthat all amounts will be so paid. For contracts entered into on or after October 1, 1988, (or with respectto which there are contract actions required to be reported on or afterthat date) it is proposed that the information required to be reportedto the Internal Revenue Service under section 6050M must be reported ona quarterly basis (calendar quarters). Generally, it is proposed that theinformation with respect to contracts entered into during a calendar quartermust be submitted on magnetic media to the Service on or before the lastday of the calendar month following the quarter. A special reporting rulepermitting the use of paper reporting on Form 8596 is provided for thoseFederal executive agencies that reasonably expect to enter into fewer than250 contracts to be reported for a calendar year. To the extent permittedin future guidance relating to section 6050M, those Federal executive agenciesthat would be required to use magnetic media would be permitted to submitmore than one return per quarter where each separate submission coversall of the contracts and contract actions required to be reported for thequarter for one or more readily identifiable operating functions of theFederal executive agency.If a Federal executive agency reports all the information that the InternalRevenue Service requires with respect to one or more contracts to the FederalProcurement Data System, it is proposed that the agency may elect to havethe Director of the Federal Procurement Data Center make, on its behalf,the return required with respect to all such contracts.These rules are proposed to apply to Federal executive agencies with respectto their contracts (and their contract actions treated as contracts underparagraph (e) of the regulations) entered into on or after October 1, 1988.The Internal Revenue Service proposes to reserve on the issue of reportingby Federal executive agencies regarding their contracts (and their contractactions treated as contracts under paragraph (e) of the regulations) enteredinto before October 1, 1988.The reporting requirements proposed in this document are slightly differentfrom those set forth in Notice 87-1, which was published in Internal RevenueBulletin 1987-1, dated January 5, 1987. To the extent there is a difference,the rules proposed in this document, which are less burdensome than thosein Notice 87-1, would be controlling, if adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>Although this document is a notice of proposed rulemaking that solicitspublic comment, the Internal Revenue Service has concluded that the noticeand public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply becausethe rules provided herein are interpretative. Accordingly, these proposedregulations do not constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determinedthat these proposed rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order12291 and that a Regulatory Impact Analysis therefore is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests For a Public Hearing</ITAG>Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) tothe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available forpublic inspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon writtenrequest to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted written comments.If a public hearing is held, notice of time and place will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is Thomas J. Kane ofthe Legislation and Regulations Division of the Office of Chief Counsel,Internal Revenue Service.
