(contracts).andO;Product:   Topic (Data base management system) (usage).andO;Topic:     Data Base Management SystemsSoftware packagesMarketing Strategy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Kathleen DolerandM;Software maker Verity Inc. is walking a thin line as it courts, competes andworks with nearly all of the relational-database companies.andM;Verity sells Topic, a free-form text-retrieval system that enables users tomanage and retrieve unstructured data, such as documentation, news-wire copyand personnel records.andP;  But unlike many other retrieval programs, Topic mapsto existing data, including relational databases, using its SQL-Bridgeoption.andM;So, although Topic competes with such products as Oracle Corp.'s SQL*Text, itmust also interface with Oracle's relational database, as well as with thoseof other companies.andM;In addition, selling Topic often requires input from these same databasemakers.andP;  The retrieval system is typically sold to departmental computerusers, said Robert Williams, vice president of marketing at Verity, inMountain View, Calif.andP;  But because of its hooks to relational databases, itoften requires &quot;the blessing&quot; of the information-systems department, whichpurchases and manages the database, he said.andM;So far, Verity has maintained its independence, but a large databasemanufacturer could be an attractive suitor.andP;  &quot;From the end-user standpoint,it would make sense for corporate buyers to go to one place for both products-- they want tight integration between the two products,&quot; Williams said.andM;For now, Verity has ample funding with the $9.4 million it raised in venturefinancing.andP;  Investors include U.S.andP;  Venture Partners and Asset Management,both of Palo Alto, Calif.; Olympic Venture Partners in Seattle; GrotechManagement in Washington; Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco; and ChancellorCapital Management Inc. in New York.andM;In just two years, Verity has built three commercial versions of Topic -- forDOS, Unix and Digital Equipment Corp.'s VMS platforms.andP;  By mid-1990, Topicwill also be available on the Macintosh and on OS/2, promises Clifford Reid,Verity's vice president of product development.andM;The company has also attracted some of Silicon Valley's best talent, oftenwooing them away from database vendors.andP;  Company President, Chairman and CEOMichael Pliner was founder of Sytek Inc. Williams came from database makerRelational Technology Inc.andP;  And the company also includes former Oracle andInformix Software Inc. executives.andM;One emerging market for Verity is the management of real-time data from newsfeeds such as the Dow Jones News Retrieval and PR Newswire.andP;  Through itsReal-time System (RTS) option, Topic can act as a data lens for Wall Streetanalysts and other users who sift through vast quantities of new information.andO;With the profiling capability, users can describe what they're interested in;if a document comes through on the feed that fits the profile, the systemnotifies the user.andM;Analysts agree that real-time capability spurs market demand for textretrieval.andP;  &quot;It becomes a very powerful tool when it can be combined withother kinds of on-line real-time information,&quot; said Ken McPherson, directorof software research for International Data Corp., a market-research firm inFramingham, Mass.andM;According to McPherson, the market for text-retrieval and -management toolsis extremely broad.andP;  &quot;There are many corporations that have amassed hugeamounts of machine-readable documents that they simply can't track or accessanymore.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
