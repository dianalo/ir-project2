Denison, a Toronto-based resources concern, said it alsoomitted paying dividends on its preferred shares. The companysaid it made the move because of declining profit fromoperations brought on by lower oil and gas production andprices as well as weak potash prices. The company hasn't paidcash dividends on its common shares since 1986.</LP><TEXT>   The latest quarterly loss compared with net profit in theyear-earlier period of C$8 million, or one Canadian cent ashare. Revenue fell to C$84.2 million from C$98.5 million.   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Denison's Class A sharesplunged 35 Canadian cents, or 18%, to close yesterday atC$1.65. The Class B shares fell 22 Canadian cents to C$1.35.   Denison's preferred stock also plummetted. The Series Apreferred shares closed at C$7.50, down C$4.75. The Series Bshares halved in value, losing C$7.88 to close at C$7.88.   Denison spokesman Ed Shiller said the company wrote downC$80 million on its Italian oil interests because of lowercrude prices and a reduction in proven reserves. He said thewrite-down doesn't reflect the economic value of theproperty, however, because of rising oil prices since the endof the second quarter.   Mr. Shiller said the write-down shouldn't affect thecompany's ability to sell its overseas oil and gas interests,which have been up for sale for more than a year. Disposingof these interests, which are located in Italy, Greece, Spainand Egypt, is critical to Denison's ability to reduce itsburdensome debt load, analysts say. The company had debt ofC$316 million as of Dec. 31, 1989.   Denison also has been hurt by costly uranium operationsand market prices that are at record lows. The companypreviously announced plans to reduce the work force at itsElliot Lake, Ontario, uranium mine by about 30% as of Aug. 1.Denison said it took a provision of C$4.2 million in thesecond quarter to cover costs of scaling back operations atthe mine.</TEXT></DOC>
