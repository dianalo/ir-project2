The facility started partial operationin 1950 with a large pilot facility operating until 1956 and a smallerpilot facility operating until 1963. A black substance which fluorescedunder ultraviolet light contaminated the entire area devoted to coal-hydrogenation.The total number of workers in the facility from 1950 to 1964 was 445.Inspection of worker's skin between 1955 and 1964 revealed skin canceroccurring at 16 to 30 times the expected rate. While the cohort of 445men could be identified there were some problems. First, the exposuresto the coal hydrogenation process were brief. Secondly, all the employeeshad other exposures, the effects of some of which may be additive, synergistic,or antagonistic, which would obscure the findings of the study. The authorconcludes that, primarily due to the diversity of exposures, this facilityshould not be included in the overall epidemiological survey.</TEXT></DOC>
