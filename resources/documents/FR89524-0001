These charges are increased to reflect higher costs associatedwith these programs due to the 4.1-percent increase in salaries of Federalemployees allocated by Congress under the Federal Pay Comparability Actof 1970, salary increases of State employees cooperatively utilized inadministering the programs, and other increased Agency costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Janice L. Lockard, 202-447-3506.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule has been reviewed under USDAprocedures established in Departmental Regulation 1512-1 implementing ExecutiveOrder 12291. It has been classified ``non-major'' as it does not meet thecriteria contained therein for major regulatory actions.The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has determinedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), because (i) the fees and charges merely reflect, ona cost-per-unit-graded/inspected basis, a minimal increase in the costscurrently borne by those entities utilizing the services; and (ii) competitiveeffects are offset under the major voluntary programs (resident shell eggand poultry grading) through administrative charges based on the volumeof product handled; i.e., the cost to users increases in proportion toincreased volume.Each fiscal year, the fees for services rendered to operators of officialpoultry, rabbit, shell egg, and egg products plants by the AMS are reviewed.A cost analysis is performed to determine if such fees are adequate torecover the cost of providing the services. The fees are determined bythe employee's salary and fringe benefits, cost of supervision, travel,and other overhead and administrative costs.The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended, provides for the collectionof fees approximately equal to the cost of providing voluntary egg productsinspection; voluntary egg, poultry, and rabbit grading; and laboratoryservices.The last fee increase was effective on May 1, 1987. Since then, Federalemployees' salaries have increased by about 6 percent, including a 4.1-percentincrease in salaries beginning in January 1989. Also, health benefits areup 28 percent, and salaries of federally licensed State employees haveincreased by about 9 percent. Additionally, the costs for workers' compensationincreased 15 percent.With the exception of salary increases for federally licensed State graders,costs of supervision and other overhead and administrative costs have alsoincreased for the reasons described above. These costs are covered by anadministrative service charge assessed on each case of shell eggs and eachpound of poultry handled in plants using resident grading service. In 1987,these rates were established at $.026 per case of shell eggs and $.00026per pound of poultry. These rates are changed to $.027 and $.00027, respectively.Also, these charges were set at a minimum of $130 and maximum of $1,300per billing period for each official plant. These amounts are changed to$135 and $1,350, respectively.Overall, resident fees and charges will be increased about 10 percent.Due to the situations described above, the hourly rate for nonresidentvoluntary grading and inspection service is increased from $23.20 to $24.12.Likewise, the rate for such services performed on Saturdays, Sundays, orholidays is increased from $24.92 each to $25.92. The hourly rate for laboratoryanalyses for other than individual tests is increased from $29.32 to $30.52,and the fees for individual tests are increased approximately 4 percent.Administrative charges for the resident voluntary rabbit grading and eggproducts inspection programs and nonresident voluntary continuous poultryand egg grading programs continue to be based on 25 percent of the grader'sor inspector's total salary costs. The minimum charge per billing periodfor these programs is increased from $130 to $135 per official plant.Based on an analysis of costs to provide these services, a proposed ruleto increase the fees for certain grading and inspection services for eggs,poultry, and rabbits was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 11541) on March 21, 1989. Comments onthe proposed rule were solicited from interested parties until April 20,1989. No comments were received. Therefore, the amendments are promulgatedas proposed.Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions containedin 7 CFR Parts 55, 56, and 70 have been previously approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter35, and 7 CFR Part 55 has been assigned OMB No. 0581-0146; and 7 CFR Part56 has been assigned OMB No. 0581-0128; and 7 CFR Part 70 has been assignedOMB No. 0581-0127.Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, good cause is found for makingthis rule effective less than 30 days after publication, because currentrevenue does not cover the costs of providing these services and the newfees should be made effective as soon as possible in order to conform withnormal monthly billing cycles. A 30-day comment period was provided forin the proposed rule and no comments were received. Accordingly, this ruleis made effective June 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 55Egg products, Voluntary inspection service.7 CFR Part 56  Shell eggs, Voluntary grading service.7 CFR Part 70Poultry, Poultry products, Rabbit products, Voluntary grading service.For reasons set out in the preamble and under authority contained in theAgricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 <T3>et seq.</T3>), Title 7, Parts 55, 56, and 70 of the Code of FederalRegulations, is amended as follows.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 55_VOLUNTARY INSPECTION OF EGG PRODUCTS AND GRADING</ITAG>1.
