The Soviet debt problem is expected to be at the top ofthe agenda when finance ministers and central bankers of theseven nations meet with Soviet economic officials in Bangkok,Thailand, late next week. While Western officials believe theSoviet Union has enough foreign exchange earnings to serviceits debt, they're worried that some newly assertive Sovietrepublics have stopped forwarding foreign exchange earningsto the central government.</LP><TEXT>   Officials say they are willing to contemplate some sort ofloan to the Soviet Union to help meet debt payments while itsorts out economic relations between the republics and thecentral government. The seven industrial nations are theU.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.   Earlier this year, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachevsuggested to Western leaders that the Soviet Union wanted torenegotiate its bank debt. The U.S. and its allies stronglyopposed such a step, and Soviet leaders apparently backeddown.   &quot;Debt relief is not under discussion,&quot; TreasuryUndersecretary David Mulford said at a news conferenceyesterday.   Mr. Mulford wouldn't comment, however, on whether the U.S.was considering a bridge loan. He said the Soviet Union &quot;mayhave a payments problem -- it could be characterized as apossible liquidity problem. We are ready to discuss this withthem to find some solutions.&quot;   Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Institute ofInternational Finance, said at a separate news conferencethat the Soviet Union's Foreign Economic Bank was current onall its debt obligations as of Wednesday. Moreover, analysisby his group, which represents 135 major international banks,suggests &quot;the Soviet Union has the economic wherewithal toservice its debt&quot; for the rest of this year.   Nevertheless, Mr. Schulmann acknowledged there may bepolitical problems that keep foreign exchange from flowing tothe Soviet Foreign Economic Bank. He said his informationsuggests the bank &quot;continues to receive foreign exchange fromthe republics -- although perhaps not as much as usual.&quot;   Mr. Schulmann indicated that banks would welcome agovernment bridge loan, if only as a back-up. &quot;It's alwaysgood to have friends who can help you out if the liquidityproblem turns out to be more serious than it looks,&quot; he said.&quot;Such a backup facility would be a good idea.&quot;   Mr. Schulmann's institute estimates Soviet debt totals $60billion. Of that amount, roughly $40 billion is owed tocommercial banks, while most of the rest is owed togovernments. But Mr. Schulmann noted that half thecommercial-bank debt is either guaranteed or insured byWestern governments.   The U.S. has little at stake; its share of the debt isless than $1 billion. Germany, on the other hand, holds morethan a third of the total debt.   A bridge loan, by definition, assumes the borrower has aspecific, temporary need for credit. The problem in theSoviet situation is that it isn't clear whether the republicsare committed ever to servicing the debts contracted in thepast by the Union's government. The industrial nations willseek assurances from Soviet officials in Bangkok that alldebt will be serviced.   Mr. Schulmann said international law requires therepublics to continue servicing the Union's debt. He citedthe 1983 Vienna Convention, which states that the &quot;debt ofthe predecessor state shall pass to the successor state in anequitable proportion.&quot;   Moreover, he said payment of debt is in the republics'interest, as failure to pay would damage theircreditworthiness.</TEXT></DOC>
