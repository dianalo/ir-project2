First and foremost, while the documented procedure forinstalling the Pathworks client kit will work under System 7, do not use it!andO;The documented installation procedure will replace newer versions of networkservice software with their obsolete predecessors and will corrupt your Macsystem software.andP;  The Pathworks client software must be installed manually.andO;Here's a step-by-step description of the procedure.andM;Step 1 - Verify the System 7 release level.andP;  Numerous beta test releases ofSystem 7 preceded the so-call Master&quot; release issued by Apple Computer inMay. Each of the beta releases exhibited compatibility problems, and noneshould be used.andP;  Use the &quot;About This Macintosh&quot; option under the Finder'sApple menu to make sure you are using the official System 7 release.andP;  Step 2- Obtain and install the latest Ethernet driver software.andP;  This step does notapply to you if your Mac is connected to Apple's LocalTalk LAN cabling.andM;If your Mac is on LocalTalk, proceed to Step 3.andP;  If your Mac is connected toan Ethernet cable, then obtain and install the System 7-compatible version ofthe Ethernet driver from the vendor of the Ethernet interface hardware.andP;  Thestandard Apple System 7 kit includes a driver for Apple's EtherTalk card.andP;  Ifyou are using a third-party Ethernet card, you will need to contact thevendor for the proper System 7 drivers.andM;Step 3 - Install Pathworks V1.0 under System 7.andP;  Because System 7 comesequipped with Macintosh Communications Toolbox system resources, you can copythe necessary Pathworks support software simply by dragging its icons fromthe Pathworks file server volume into your Mac's System Folder.andM;Use AppleShare in the Mac's Chooser to connect to the Pathworks clientdistribution kit (see Figure).andP;  Open the Installation Folder, and you willfind another folder titled &quot;Throw away after Installing.&quot; Pathworks liveshere.andP;  Open this folder and look inside.andM;A folder within this folder, titled &quot;For Communications folder,&quot; contains thevarious Pathworks communications toolbox components.andP;  Select all theCommunications Toolbox icons in this folder and drag them into your Mac'sSystem Folder.andP;  After alerting you with a dialog box, System 7 willautomatically move the Communications Tools into your System Folder'sExtensions Folder, which is where they belong.andM;Next, open the folder titled &quot;For System folder.&quot; Select all file icons inthis folder except MacTCP, Hosts and ADSP.andP;  Drag the selected files into yourMac's System Folder.andM;Note that the Pathworks version of MacTCP, version 1.0.1, does not work underSystem 7.andP;  If you need TCP/IP, obtain version 1.0.2 from Apple.andP;  In addition,the file titled &quot;CommToolBox.andP;  rsrc&quot; is an obsolete system resource that isnow built into System 7.andP;  The icon can be ignored.andP;  Likewise, the foldertitled &quot;Data Access Language&quot; contains an old version of DAL resources nowincorporated into System 7.andP;  Make sure you do not drag this folder or any ofits contents into your System Folder.andM;Step 4 - Move the Apple-Digital icon.andP;  The Apple-Digital chooser tool thatcomes with Pathworks V1.0 works only if it is kept at the top level of theMac's System Folder.andP;  If the Apple-Digital Chooser document is in your Mac'sExtensions Folder (System 7 puts it there by default when you drag it fromthe network server volume), drag it out and place it at the top level of theSystem Folder.andM;You can now copy the various Pathworks applications to your Mac's hard diskand start using Pathworks under System 7.andM;What Next?andM;A few additional considerations pertain to specific Pathworks components.andM;The software setup for Apple's LaserWriter printer has been changed underSystem 7 and is not upward-compatible with the previous release.andP;  To usePathworks' VAXshare printer services in System 7 networks, you will need toupgrade VAXshare with a Digital-supplied Engineering Change Order (ECO).andP;  Atthe time of this writing, Digital planned to include this ECO on thedistribution diskette with Mail for Macintosh.andP;  The ECO can also be obtainedthrough Digital customer support in Atlanta.andM;A few extra installation chores remain for DAL users.andP;  Under System 7, thelist of DAL hosts available in the network is kept in a file called DALPreferences, found in the System Folder's Preferences subfolder.andP;  UnderSystem 6, this list was kept as a file called hosts.c11, stored at the toplevel of the System Folder.andP;  If you are using a hosts.cil file, you willprobably want to preserve it for use under System 7.andP;  Delete the DALPreferences file provided with System 7.andP;  Drag your hosts.c11 file into thePreferences subfolder in your System 7 System Folder, and then rename it &quot;DALPreferences.&quot; The new DAL system software will then use your existing hostdefinitions.andM;Some older DAL applications, such as the DAL demo software provided withPathworks, will fail under System 7, as they mistakenly look for DAL hosts inthe old System 6 location.andP;  This problem can be corrected with a file alias.andO;First select the DAL Preferences file icon, and then use the Make Aliasoption under the Finder's File menu.andP;  A file alias called RDAL PreferencesAlias will be created.andP;  Move this file alias to the top level of the SystemFolder and rename it &quot;hosts.c11.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
