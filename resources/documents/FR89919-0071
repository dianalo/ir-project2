No. 11-00589), its MineNo. 25 (I.D. No. 11-02392), and its Mine No. 26 (I.D. No. 11-00590), alllocated in Franklin County, Illinois. The petition is filed under section101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that entries used as intake andreturn aircourses be separated from belt haulage entries, and that belthaulage entries not be used to ventilate active working places.2. The belt haulage entries are ventilated by coursing intake air throughthe belt entry to the loading point where it is coursed directly into anadjacent return. Tubing is provided to course the belt air across the adjacentintakes to a return in the vicinity.3. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use the air in the beltentry to supplement the ventilation of active working places.4. In support of this request, petitioner states that a low-level carbonmonoxide detection system would be installed in all belt entries utilizedas intake aircourses. The low-level CO system would be capable of givingwarning of a fire for four hours should the power fail; a visual alertsignal would be activated when the CO level is 10 ppm above the ambientlevel and an audible signal would sound at 15 ppm above the establishedambient level. All persons would be withdrawn to a safe area at 10 ppmand evacuated at 15 ppm. The CO monitoring system would initiate the firealarm signals at an attended surface location where there is two-way communication.This responsible person would notify the working sections and other personnelwho may be endangered, when the established alert and alarm levels arereached. The CO system would be capable of identifying any activated sensorand for monitoring electrical continuity and deleting electrical malfunctions.5. The CO monitoring system would be visually examined at least once eachcoal producing shift and tested for functional operation weekly to ensurethe monitoring system is functioning properly. The monitoring system wouldbe calibrated with known concentrations of CO and air mixtures at leastmonthly.6. If at any time the CO monitoring system or any portion of the systemhas been deenergized for reasons such as routine maintenance or failureof a sensor unit, the belt conveyor may continue to operate provided theaffected portion of the belt conveyor entry would be continuously patrolledand monitored for CO by a qualified person using hand-held CO detectingdevices.7. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
