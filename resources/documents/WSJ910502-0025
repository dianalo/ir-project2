New Zealanders move more than anyone else, according to ananalysis of mobility data from 16 countries in the early1980s by Larry Long of the U.S. Census Bureau. Nineteenpercent of New Zealanders moved annually. Canada and the U.S.followed, with annual mobility rates of 18%, and thenAustralia, with 17%.   Hong Kong, Switzerland, Israel and Puerto Rico had annualmobility rates of 11% to 15%. The other countries studied,including Britain and France, had rates below 10%. Irelandwas lowest, with annual mobility of just 6%.   Though mobility rates vary, life patterns of moving aresimilar in most places. In the six countries for whichdetailed age information was studied, moving rates were highfor preschool children and for their parents, many of whomare in their late 20s and early 30s. This is especially truein the U.S., perhaps because of high divorce rates amongparents of young children.   Moving rates fall for older children and teens, but climbagain in young adulthood. People in their early 20s were morelikely than anyone else to move in all six countries. Movingrates then taper off through middle age and into old age. Mr.Long says the &quot;similarity is somewhat surprising in view ofconsiderable differences among the countries in housingprograms, labor mobility, and customs and traditions thataffect choice of residence.&quot;                                                                                                          Living in Houses Appears   Linked to Ownership                                                                                                          HOME OWNERSHIP in Europe ranges from a low of 29% ofhouseholds in Switzerland to a high of 82% in Ireland,according to a new study.   The average level of home ownership for 17 Europeancountries was 58%, according to a survey of 22,500 people in17 countries commissioned by Reader's Digest Association andconducted by Gallup International. In the U.S., homeownership stands at 64%, the Census Bureau says.   Ownership appears related to living in a house rather thanan apartment. The Irish, with high levels of home ownership,are much more likely to live in houses -- fully 92% -- thanin apartments. Only 30% of the Swiss, with low ownership,live in houses. This may also explain why just 51% of Swisshomes have three or more bedrooms, compared with 87% of Irishhomes. Overall, 55% of European households live in houses,and 49% have three or more bedrooms.   Apartment living, though, appears linked to some modernconveniences. In Switzerland, 96% of households havetelephones, and 90% have central heating. Only 52% of Irishhouseholds have phones, and only 61% have central heating.For all 17 countries, 84% of homes have phones, and 68% havecentral heating.   Some amenities are universal. The Irish and Swiss areequally likely to have color televisions and videocassetterecorders. In fact, television ownership varies only slightlyamong the 17 countries studied, from 92% in Portugal to 98%in Italy, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Irelandand Luxembourg.                                                                                                          Ah, to Be in Athens   When Budgets Are Tight                                                                                                          THE united Europe of 1992 is almost here, but EuropeanCommunity nations show wide disunity on living costs.   Paris is the most expensive of 12 EC cities, with livingcosts 55% above the U.S. average, according to a study byRunzheimer International, consultants in Rochester, Wis. It'sfollowed by Madrid, London, Copenhagen, and Milan, Italy; inall of these, it costs more than $100,000 a year to achievethe same living standard that $75,000 would attain in ahypothetical average U.S. city. Athens is the cheapest of the12 EC cities studied, with living costs 5% below the U.S.average.   Paris ranks second in housing expense, with a rental unitof six to nine rooms costing an average of $4,292 a month.Only Madrid is more expensive ($4,339) for housing, withLondon close behind. Athens is the cheapest ($1,530).   Copenhagen has the highest food costs. Both eating at homeand eating out cost twice as much there as the average forthe U.S. Eating out in London and Milan also costs twice theU.S. average, though eating in costs less than in Copenhagen.Even in the least expensive cities, Athens and Lisbon, foodcosts are at least 10% higher than in the U.S.   Gasoline is nearly twice as expensive in Milan ($4.73) asin Luxembourg ($2.51). Fuel also costs more than $4 a gallonin Paris and Dublin, and less than $3 in Frankfurt, Germany.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SWEDES often act as a bellwether for trends in the rest ofthe Western world, says Nathan Keyfitz of the InternationalInstitute for Applied Systems Analysis, a nonprofit thinktank in Austria. He notes that Sweden's total fertility ratehas risen to two children per woman and suggests that higherbirth rates are in store for other developed countries. . . .Levels of disability range from 0.2% of the population inPeru to 20.9% of Austrians, according to an analysis of 30countries by Yeun-chung Yu of the United Nations Demographicand Social Statistics Branch. But much of this variation is amatter of definition. Austria uses a broad definition ofdisability that includes people with minor visual and hearingimpairments.</TEXT></DOC>
