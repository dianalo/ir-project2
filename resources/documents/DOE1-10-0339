<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0339 </DOCNO><TEXT>Short information of investigations of Soviet and Czechoslovakian specialistsinto fast reactor thermal physics is given, actuality of investigationinto fuel assembly (FA) abnormal operating modes is pointed out. Factorsdetermining shaping of rate and temperature fields in FA during the reactoroperating cycle under normal and abnormal operation conditions are classified.Specific features of fast reactor FA geometry are described. Resultsof investigations into local (rate distributions, tangential stress,turbulent microstructure) and averaged (hydraulic resistance coefficient,expenditures) hydrodynamic characteristics in fast reactor FA obtainedowing to aerodynamical and electromagnetic measurements on models arestated. Generalizing formulae for calculating the hydraulic resistancecoefficients in smooth rod clusters and wire wrapped fuel rods have beenderived as a result of analysis and generalization of data obtained indifferent investigations. 68 refs.; 46 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
