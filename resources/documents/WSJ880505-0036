Blue-chip issues, which paced the market's advance Tuesday, led its retreat yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.05 to 2036.31, more than offsetting its 15.09-point gain Tuesday.    Among broader market averages, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.68 to 260.32, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.27 to 147.30. Declining Big Board issues led advancers 923 to 561.    Big Board volume, which rose Tuesday to 176.9 million shares as the result of dividend-related trading by institutions, slipped to 141.3 million -- back around the low levels that have prevailed over the past week.    Stock prices dropped shortly after the opening and spent most of the day drifting at lower levels. Late in the session, the market's downturn was exacerbated by a round of sell programs related to stock-index arbitrage, which took effect as index futures dropped to sharp discounts to the cash indices.    Philip Puccio, head of institutional trading at Dillon, Read andamp; Co., said the market remains &quot;dull and in the doldrums.&quot; Investors are reluctant to step off the sidelines at the moment &quot;unless something is really depressed or really spikes,&quot; he said.    Analysts attribute that reluctance partly to concerns that the April employment report will show another larger-than-expected increase in job creation. That could set the stage for wage increases that would boost the inflation rate and for a resulting tightening of credit by the Federal Reserve.    The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is that non-farm payrolls expanded by 264,000 last month, compared with 262,000 in March. The March figure was larger than analysts' estimates. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to show a decline to 5.5% for April from 5.6% the previous month.    Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus, said some estimates of the April payroll gain put the figure at 300,000 or higher. If they prove correct, he said, &quot;the market would be fairly well convinced&quot; that the Fed would push interest rates higher to prevent inflation from accelerating.    &quot;People had expected and even accepted the premise that the economy has been operating at a reasonably good rate of growth, and yet there's been some easing of some fears on inflation,&quot; Mr. Gordon said. &quot;Apparently, they're coming back in again.&quot;    The concern about the employment report follows Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's statement to Congress Tuesday that inflation is likely to worsen this year as the trade deficit narrows, unless domestic spending is restrained. Mr. Greenspan appeared to suggest that the Fed would boost rates eventually to slow growth in spending.    Allen Sinai, an economist at Boston Co. Economic Advisers, said a half-point boost in the Fed's discount rate, or the fee charged on loans to depository instutitions, &quot;is a 60-40 shot before midyear.&quot; The rate currently stands at 6%.    With those uncertainties hanging over the market, Mr. Gordon said, the ranks of market players on the sidelines are continuing to grow. &quot;You still have an unwillingness of people to make commitments,&quot; he said.    F.W. Woolworth, which jumped 3 1/8 Tuesday amid rumors that Dart Group was boosting its stake in the company, dropped 1 3/8 to 59 1/8. Several other blue-chip issues declined, including International Business Machines, which lost 1 3/8 to 113 1/4; General Electric, off 1 to 39 7/8; Procter andamp; Gamble, down 1 3/4 to 76; and Philip Morris, off 1 3/4 to 86 1/2.    Allegis soared 5 1/4 to 90. The pilots union at its United Airlines unit said it plans to pursue a takeover offer of $110 a share if its effort to invalidate parts of the labor agreement between the company and its machinists union is successful. The union has filed suit to overturn portions of the agreement that block it from making a bid.    USG advanced 1 5/8 to 46 1/4 as Desert Partners, its hostile suitor, offered a pair of alternatives to the company's recapitalization plan. Under one option, USG holders would be paid $48 a share in cash and debentures and would receive 15% of the surviving company's equity. Alternatively, the partnership would pay $50 in cash for 37.1 million shares and would swap the debentures and common for the rest. Neither option would take effect unless USG agrees to be acquired, Desert Partners said.    Zayre, an often-rumored takeover target, gained 1 1/2 to 25. Drexel Burnham Lambert added the stock to its restricted list, which signifies that the firm is providing the company with advisory or investment banking services, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. There also was speculation that the Bass family of Texas was buying Zayre stock; spokesmen for family members declined to comment.    Mohasco, which set a Friday deadline for receiving acquisition proposals, added 3/4 to 33. Nortek has been considering a takeover bid for the company for several months and has said it is preparing an offer that it plans to submit by the deadline.    Federal National Mortgage Association rose 1 1/4 to 37 1/4. Paine Webber added the stock to a list of issues recommended for retail clients, and Shearson Lehman Hutton reiterated its buy recommendation.    Conseco climbed 2 1/8 to 13 3/4, above the $13.50 a share that a management group is offering in a leveraged buy-out. Separately, the company said its first-quarter net income rose to 94 cents a share from 58 cents a year earlier.    The American Stock Exchange index dropped 0.68 to 302.54. Amdahl added 1 7/8 to 42 1/4. The company introduced a line of mainframe computers that it said are faster than any other mainframes on the market. One analyst said the new computers give the company a competitive edge over IBM. </TEXT></DOC>
