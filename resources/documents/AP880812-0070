But high unemployment ismaking the project hard to turn down.   About 44 percent of the 10.7 million tons of coal shippedthrough Rotterdam, the world's biggest port, come from SouthAfrica, according to city government statistics.   The Frans Swarttouw company, which claims to handle a third ofRotterdam's coal import business, wants to build a $46.7 millioncoal terminal. Rotterdam city officials are debating whether toinvest $57 million in new roads, docks and other construction worksthat would go up around the terminal.   The projects could help curb the city's 25 percent unemployment.   The Kairos anti-apartheid group wants approval of the $57million investment contingent on a Swarttouw promise not to handleany South African coal.   ``The handling of South African coal is a serious stain on theport of Rotterdam,'' Kairos wrote in a recent letter to City Hall.``Transshipment here helps shippers to conceal the coal's SouthAfrican origin.''   According to Kairos, large amounts of South African coal arebeing shipped from Rotterdam to nations that have embargoed SouthAfrican coal.   The left-wing Labor Party, which holds a 24-seat majority in the45-seat city council, said in its 1986 election platform that ``Theport of Rotterdam may not be abused for ... the import of productsfrom South Africa, particularly coal.''   Swarttouw's general director, Hans Sjouke, conceded Thursdaythat about a third of the coal handled by Swarttouw is of SouthAfrican origin, but said ``If you want to impose a boycott (ofSouth African coal) I think you want to talk to the consumers atthe end of the line.''   Most of the coal imported via Rotterdam is used by electricpower stations in the Netherlands and other European nations.   The new terminal, scheduled for completion in 1998, has beendesigned to handle coal carriers of up to 250,000 tons, in linewith a current trend toward the use of larger vessels, Sjouke saidin a telephone interview.   There is strong public and official disapproval in theNetherlands of apartheid, South Africa's system of racialsegregation. The Dutch government supports tougher sanctionsagainst South Africa by the 12 member nations of the EuropeanEconomic Community but refuses to impose a South African coalimport ban until all 12 EEC members agree to do the same.   France and Denmark are the only two EEC member nations that haveimposed such an embargo, along with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
