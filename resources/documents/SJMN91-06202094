Tojo was convictedby the Allies of war crimes and hanged in 1948.;    The excerpts show a manangered at the charge that Japan had started the war in violation ofinternational law.;    &quot;The economic pressure imposed by the United States,the British government and others was an inhuman act,&quot; he wrote from SugamoPrison. &quot;For Japan, doing nothing would have meant the destruction of thenation. We had to stand up and defend ourselves.&quot;;    The United States andits allies imposed economic sanctions against Japan after the outbreak of theChinese-Japanese war in 1937 in an effort to block Tokyo's expansion.;   According to the official U.S. account, Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor onDec. 7, 1941, before Japan formally served the U.S. government with adeclaration of war.;    In his prison writings, Tojo said a note handed toSecretary of State Cordell Hull in Washington on the day of the attack wasmeant as a declaration of war.;    U.S. historians have said the note inquestion was considered by Washington to be more of an ultimatum than a formaldeclaration of war.;    In any case, U.S. historians say Japanese diplomatshad been instructed to deliver the note to Hull only a half-hour before thestart of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In fact, the Japanese were delayed anddid not deliver the note until about an hour after the bombs started falling.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910720  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  337  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 20, 199100202094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
