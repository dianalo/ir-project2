Several Japanese manufacturers and exporters had petitioned the ITC to exclude the small-screen TV sets from inclusion under a U.S. anti-dumping order issued 16 years ago. They argued that the sets should be exempt because they have been on the market for only a few years and aren't being manufactured by U.S. companies.    But as a result of the ruling, all types of TV receivers from Japan, including conventional sets with cathode-ray picture tubes and the newer type of sets with liquid-crystal displays, will continue to be subject to the penalty duties. The ITC didn't explain the rationale for its ruling.    Japan's exports of small-screen liquid-crystal display TV sets to the U.S. were valued at about $52 million in 1986 and totaled about 770,000 units. Such imports currently are subject to U.S. anti-dumping duties ranging up to 21.9%, according to ITC officials.    Dumping occurs when a product is sold in the U.S. at prices below the cost of production or the &quot;home-market&quot; price. </TEXT></DOC>
