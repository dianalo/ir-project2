In a state where savings and loan failures have become regularevents, Bush prodded Congress to move quickly on his three-week-oldplan to save the beleagured industry. ``There's no excuse forfurther delay,'' he said.   ``The essential question today is, `What are we doing to preparefor the new world that begins 11 short years from now?'' he said.``That's what my agenda is all about.''   In his first trip West since his inauguration Jan. 20, thepresident flew to Texas and Colorado for a pair of speeches.   His first stop was in Houston for a luncheon appearance beforethe Forum Club, which bills itself as a nonpartisan educationalinstitution. Next, he was flying to Colorado Springs, Colo., toaddress the Junior Achievement National Business LeadershipConference.   In the Houston appearance, Bush ticked off a series ofinitiatives from his new administration: a spending anddeficit-reduction plan, a program to relieve Third World debt, aproposal to rescue the savings and loan industry and an increase inthe minimum wage.   On the savings and loan crisis, Bush again assured depositorsthat their savings are safe. ``They are fully protected and willcontinue to be fully protected,'' he said. In recent months, Sandamp;Lcustomers have been withdrawing deposits at a record rate.   Bush said the Sandamp;L industry must be cleaned up ``so that thequestionable ractices and outright illegalities that caused thecurrent crisis won't happen again.''   Moreover, he said, ``We must see to it that those Sandamp;L officialsguilty of criminal actions are pursued and punished for the lossesthey have caused.''   ``These are serious challenges _ ticking time bombs that we needto defuse without delay,'' he said. ``And we're doing just that.   ``But these are by no means the only issues that demandleadership and prompt action. We're entering the 1990s _ a horizondecade, threshold to a new century.''   He said that ``building a better America means laying thefoundations today for the kind of future we want.''   Along those lines, Bush said, the United States needs to takesteps to safeguard the environment against short-sighted actionsthat do long-term damage.   ``It means finding ways to preserve and strengthen indispensableinstitutions like the family in the midst of social change,'' hesaid. ``It means taking a long-range look at the internationallandscape to determine what policies and approaches will keep usfree, prosperous and at peace in the 21st century, as we are today.   ``And speaking of freedom, it means formulating a multi-sourceenergy policy that, in the long run, will make us less dependent onforeign oil,'' the president, a former Texas oilman, said in thispetroleum-oriented city.   Bush said the nation must invest in its own economy with newincentives for business, including catalysts for research anddevelopment. He called anew for a reduction in the capital gains tax.   In addition, Bush said the nation must encourage and improveeducation.   ``We aren't going to clean up the environment, turn our educationsystem around or create a more responsive business climate in asingle day,'' he said. ``But if we begin today and make steadyprogress, we will succeed.   ``In this kind of work,'' he said, ``more is going on than meetsthe eye, or makes the headlines. The proof will come when we lookback from the year 2000.''   In his speech, Bush was warmly applauded by the audience of morethan 1,000 people when he raised the controversial subject ofrestrictions on military-style assault weapons.   ``I do want to find the solution to the so-called AK-47 assaultweapon problem, one that protects the rights of the legitimatesportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers, whoare laying their lives on the line,'' he said.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thatBush applauded the decision of Colt Industries to suspend sales ofits popular AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Asked if other industriesshould follow suit, Fitzwater said the administration would standpat for now.   In recent speeches, the president has been emphasizing hisactions thus far, including proposals for rescuing the savings andloan industry, relieving Third World debt, cutting the deficit andcombating the problems of drugs, the environment and child care.   ``Let us recognize that we stand at a special moment in ourhistory,'' Bush said in a speech Wednesday night before theElectronic Industries Association, an industry trade group.   ``It is a moment not for complacency, not to sit back and reflectupon what has been but to reflect upon what might be.''   Bush said he has established four objectives: to reduce thedeficit, invest in the nation's future, confront problems thatcannot wait and avoid imposing new taxes.   ``These four objectives will build on the progress of the lasteight years. They will build a better America,'' Bush said. ``Theywill reaffirm our strengths, defuse ticking time bombs and reorientus as a nation.''   Today's speech came amid skepticism from Democrats that Congressand the administration can reach a quick agreement on a new spendingplan. Neither side has been willing to propose either new taxes ornew spending cuts to reduce the deficit.   Bush said a recent poll of corporate leaders found they believeAmericans are too short-term oriented.   ``My plan speaks to the long term, and to a stable businessclimate,'' Bush said. ``It says that to remain competitive, we mustlook beyond the next quarterly statement.''   Bush used the occasion to underscore his request for a cut in thecapital gains tax to 15 percent, saying that ``nothing could makeAmerica more competitive.''   A congressional study released this week said that 80 percent ofthe benefits from Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut would go toAmericans making more than $100,000 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
