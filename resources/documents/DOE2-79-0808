Haldor Topsoe A/S and its associatedcompany, Snamprogetti S.p.A., Milan (part of INE, the Italian NationalEnergy Company) have recently joined with Combustion Engineering, Inc.for the purpose of introducing to the U.S. electric utility market anew technology, the WSA-SNOX process. The WSA-SNOX technology is a fluegas clean-up technology which catalytically removes both SO/sub x/ andNO/sub x/ from flue gases of industrial on electric power plant boilers.In this paper, the authors provide an overview of the WSA-SNOX technology,(combination of SO/sub x/ and NO/sub x/ removal steps, designated asWSA-SNOX), a summary of its distinguishing characteristics, and the attractiveeconomics associated with SO/sub x/ and NO/sub x/ removal. The basictechnology for the USA-SNOX approach was developed in Europe by HaldorTopsoe A/S/ The first plant using the principles of the WSA process,without selective catalyst reduction (&quot;SCR&quot;), was started-up in 1983in Lacq, France. This plant, which utilized an absorption tower (USA-1process), treated a dust-free offgas containing 1% SO/sub 2/. In 1980,two WSA-1 plants which treated offgas with 10 - 15% H/sub 2/S were commissionedin Sweden. The SCR catalyst for DeNO/sub x/ of flue/exhaust gases wasdeveloped by Haldor Topsoe A/S in 1983 - 1985. Since May, 1986, testingin a process demonstration unit (6300 SCFM) under high and low dust conditionshas been carried out on the flue gas from a coal fired power plant.</TEXT></DOC>
