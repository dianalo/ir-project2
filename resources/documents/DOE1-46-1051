Pd(II), Co(II),and VO(II) salicylaldiminates based on 2-amino-4,6-di-tert-butylphenolare capable of one-electron oxidation with the formation of metal-containingphenoxyl radicals. Analysis of the ESR spectra showed that the appearanceof the metallocycle leads to a sharp increase in the stability of theradical system.</TEXT></DOC>
