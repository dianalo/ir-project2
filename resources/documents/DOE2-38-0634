Stability limit to radiation doseof chemical bonds between silica matrix and grafted organic layer isdetermined. Gas-chromatographic analysis of grafted layer hydrolysisproducts after irradiation is carried out. It is shown that scissionof chemisorption bonds is the main butoxyaerosil radiolysis mechanismat low radiation doses. With further increase of radiation dose radiolysisof n-butanol takes place.</TEXT></DOC>
