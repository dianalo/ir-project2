The dollar ended the week at 142.45 yen, up 1.40 yen fromThursday's close of 141.05 yen. It opened at 141.95 yen, and tradedbetween 141.80 yen and 142.75 yen.   Volume totaled $9.483 billion, down from Thursday's $10.358billion.   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 140.19-pointgainer Thursday, shed 313.64 points, or 0.88 percent, closing theweek at 35,209.35.   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 700 millionshares, compared to Thursday's 900 million.   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's strength to an upswingin overseas markets Thursday despite interest rate hikes by WestEuropean central banks. Higher interest rates are supposed tosupport a currency against other currencies.   Earlier Thursday, the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank,raised its key lending rates by 1 percentage point, including theofficial discount rate, to 6 percent annually. The measure wasaimed at curbing the dollar's strength in order to help steminflationary pressures in West Germany.   Central banks in Britain, France and other European nationsfollowed with similar measures Thursday.   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said Japan'scentral bank intervened selling many millions of dollars, but said``the intervention helped little'' to stop the dollar's upwardpressure.   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary activities.   Tanahashi said the market is awaiting U.S. umemployment figuresfor September, due out later today in Washington, as a factor infinding the dollar's direction.   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto meanwhile told a newsconference today Japan will watch carefully for any impact from theraise in West European interest rates. He added, however, ``We arenot considering any change in our monetary policy'' for now.   On the stock market, the market's main barometer fell followingthree bullish sessions this week apparently due to the higher WestEuropean interest rates.   They said concern over the upcoming jobless rate was anotherfactor that sent many investors to the sidelines.</TEXT></DOC>
