Shrinking NATO defense budgets and a recessionary dipin airline revenues cast a pall.   McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and some other aerospacegiants even chose to forgo &quot;chalets&quot; along the flight line atLe Bourget field. They preferred to save the cost of theseexpensive suites, where customers sip drinks, munch Frenchdelicacies and gaze skyward to see pilots demonstrating, atsome risk, the high-G twists and turns of Mirages andMiG-31s.</LP><TEXT>   The combination of a tighter market and reduced Cold Wartensions, however, has brought a new twist in the corporatealliances that have globalized aerospace. Would you believe aGulfstream -- today's Cadillac of U.S. corporate jets --capable of supersonic speeds and bearing the legend,&quot;Designed in the U.S.S.R.?&quot; Or a McDonnell Douglas smallpassenger jet entering world markets with a &quot;Made in thePeople's Republic of China&quot; label? Or the U.S., Europe, Japanand the Soviet Union all working together to produce the nextgeneration of supersonic airliners? Potentialcommunist-capitalist alliances were the talk of this show.   Only the McDonnell Douglas-China linkup is reality.McDonnell Douglas already has a plant in China to co-produceits MD-80 airliner. At the air show it signed a memorandum ofunderstanding with the Chinese, engine maker Pratt andamp; Whitneyand Northwest Airlines to assemble a new 105-passengertwin-jet, the MD-95, in China. The hope is to export someplanes, particularly in Asia. Northwest will evaluate them.   The goal of these alliances is to tap big markets whilesharply cutting development and production costs. AllenPaulson, chief executive officer and godfather of GulfstreamAerospace, no doubt had that in mind when he and MikhailSimonov of the Soviet Union's Sukhoi Design Bureau announcedfurther joint study of a supersonic business jet. Airframemanufacture and much of the design work would be done in theU.S.S.R. There are no firm commitments but the two talkedabout a plane that would carry eight to 12 passengers and acrew of two at twice the speed of sound, with a minimum rangeof 4,000 nautical miles.   Even more visionary is the global consortium to build anew SST. Here again, the idea is to spread development costs.The Soviets want to join, and have received encouragementfrom the French.   In short, Western aircraft manufacturers are trying tocash in on production and design capabilities in countrieswhere there is little serious concern for, or evenunderstanding of, balance-sheet constraints. This is perhapsa natural extension of attempts to spread development costsand lower final price tags.   But in the capitalist nations themselves some tensions aredeveloping over alliances, and they have to do with the samething that McDonnell Douglas and Gulfstream are trying tocapitalize on in the Communist countries: state subsidies.There is not too much difference, after all, in the Sovietgovernment subsidizing Sukhoi at some unknown cost, and theFrench government subsidizing its aerospace industry at someknown but secret cost. The French are harder for private U.S.aerospace companies to cope with, however.   A potentially serious trade dispute is developing betweenthe U.S. and Europe over what the U.S. sees as unfair statesubsidies to the companies that constitute Airbus Industrie,a French-German-British-Spanish consortium that producesAirbus airliners. Airbus has become increasingly aggressivein the world market and now is believed to hold about 30% ofthe world's airliner orders. The company has become theworld's second-ranking producer, behind Boeing. It was aspecial blow to the U.S. here when Airbus landed an orderfrom Kuwait, a country that the U.S. had just saved from theclutches of Saddam Hussein.   The U.S. claims that Airbus represents unfair competitionbecause it is heavily subsidized by the governments that backthe consortium. Although Airbus is not required to makepublic disclosure of its finances, the U.S. claims that 75%of the development costs of new Airbuses are paid for bytaxpayers. Airbus retorts that Boeing itself is subsidizedthrough U.S. military contracts, to which Boeing respondsthat, if anything, its commercial business subsidizes itsmilitary business, which recently has lost money.   But U.S. firms won't be pushovers. If anything was evidenthere, it was U.S. technological dominance. The star of theshow was the Lockheed F-117A stealth strike plane, which wonits spurs in the Gulf War by sneaking into Iraqi airspace toknock out high-value targets. Lockheed's CEO, Dan Tellep,told me that he thinks that because of Boeing's skills andtechnology, it will stave off the Airbus challenge.   Airbus projects a 600-passenger, four-engine airliner, butBoeing is betting its future on a large two-engine plane, the777. Both General Electric and Pratt andamp; Whitney are developinghuge power plants for such an airplane. As one industryspecialist here comments, any plane that flies on two goodengines will almost certainly be more economical than a planeof similar size that needs three or four -- and also easierto fly. Moreover, some European parliaments, and the ECcommission, are beginning to carp about Airbus subsidies.   Will alliances with Communist countries add a newdimension to aerospace competition? It doesn't seem likelysoon. The Soviets have an enormous design capacity, but theyhave never been able to match the technological advances ofprivate U.S. companies. Airliners are bought on the basis oftheir economy and performance over the life of the plane, sotechnology has importance in that field just as it has inmilitary aircraft.   There is also, as always, the question of exactly what thecurrent generation of Soviet aerospace leaders have in theback of their minds. Are they merely trying to earn some hardcurrency, or is the whole effort directed by the powerfulSoviet military-industrial complex for the purpose of tryingto narrow the gap between Soviet and Westernmilitary-aircraft technology?   However, the real military-aviation frontier is incomputers and electronics. Grumman Corp. at the Paris showdemonstrated its Joint STARS air-to-ground surveillancesystem, also just back from a Gulf Storm debut. Computerscreens in an E-8 four-engine jet enabled Gulf Stormcommanders to actually see the movements of Iraqi tanks,represented by small white dots, and call in F-15Es todestroy them. It is breathtaking to see the white dotsdisappear from the screen as the tanks are knocked out.   Alliances or not, and government subsidies or not, don'tdiscount private American aerospace companies. They're stillthe best in the business.</TEXT></DOC>
