Nurses at San Francisco General Hospital, Laguna Honda Hospital,and several city health clinics set a Monday strike deadline, butextended it on a day-to-day basis.   ``We reached this settlement on time because none of the partieswanted to add to the health care fears that have permeated thiscity'' since the labor disputes began, said Mayor Art Agnos at aCity Hall news conference.   Details of the pact were not released. Local 790 of the UnitedPublic Employees sought to reduce nurse-patient ratios and improvemeasures to retain and recruit nurses. Pay was not an issue.   Talks were held around-the-clock, and the settlement was reachedabout 4:30 a.m. Sunday, said Eileen Mahoney, a spokeswoman for themayor's office.   San Francisco General Hospital cares for the city's poorest andsickest patients and Laguna Honda has about 1,000 elderly patients.   Union members will vote on the proposal Tuesday.   Agnos also called for an immediate resumption of bargaining inthe strikes, adding he planned to ``very actively, veryaggressively'' involve himself and other city officials in thedisputes.   No new talks have been scheduled in the strikes.   Seven hospitals were struck July 26 by 1,700 licensed vocationalnurses and hospital workers represented by Local 250 of theHospital and Health Care Workers Union. On Aug. 2, more than 2,000registered nurses represented by the California Nurses Associationstruck at six of those facilities.   On Saturday, 130 nurses represented by the California NursesAssociation and an undetermined number of service workersrepresented by Local 250 also went on strike at French Hospital.   The struck hospitals have remained open.   The strike by Local 250 is mainly over health benefits and sickleave. Increased pay is the issue with the California NursesAssociation, which wants an 11 percent raise for the first year anda 10 percent raise the second year of a two-year contract.   The hospitals are negotiating as a group called AffiliatedHospitals, and have offered 18 percent raises over 31 months, whichwould cost the affected six hospitals $40 million.   Talks with French Hospital employees are separate from the othernegotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
