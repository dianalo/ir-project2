Billboard defenders say it's important formotorists to know how many miles before the next budget motelor Big Mac, which no doubt only further outrages theaesthetic environmentalists.   Before anyone on either side of the billboard debate getstoo excited, however, the law must intrude. As thecivil-liberties groups often note, our Constitution defendseven the most unloved. This means billboards have rights,too, including the right under the Fifth Amendment not to beexpropriated. More precisely, their owners have the samerights as other property owners to be left in peace orotherwise get full compensation if the government decidestheir property must go.</LP><TEXT>   The latest version of anti-billboard legislation comesfrom Rhode Island Republican Sen. John Chafee, who calls hisbill the Visual Pollution Control Act. It threatens the400,000 billboards along federal roads, which are about 80%of all billboards. His bill would amend the 1965 HighwayBeautification Act, which acknowledged the constitutionalrequirement to pay full compensation for seized billboards.The proposed change would instead let states and localitiesclose down the signs and only pretend to pay compensation.   This fiscal sleight of hand is based on a rationale calledamortization theory, which would let the government closedown billboards on a take-away, layaway plan. The bill wouldlet local governments expropriate billboards, then &quot;pay&quot;compensation to the owners simply by giving them a few yearsbefore the signs must come down. In other words, for theprivilege of getting to use their property for a few moreyears, owners would then simply hand over the property to thegovernment without getting a dime in actual compensation.   &quot;The argument that the permission to operate one'sproperty is a benefit,&quot; Theodore Olson, a lawyer forbillboard companies, says, &quot;is no different than the argumentthat the thief's demand `Your money or your life' benefitsthe victim by granting him his life.&quot;   As an economic matter, the amortization theory is far fromfull compensation. How can an owner be compensated simply bygetting a few years' notice that he is going to lose all thevalue in his property? Under this reasoning, a city couldannounce that there can be no buildings taller than 10stories, then announce that owners will be &quot;compensated&quot; byallowing them to occupy the buildings for five years beforeleveling them. Or a local government could claim eminentdomain over your house to build a highway, then claim the&quot;compensation&quot; is a delay in the highway construction for afew years.   The Fifth Amendment refers to &quot;just compensation,&quot; notapproximate compensation, token compensation or compensationby delayed taking. Instead, full compensation must meanpayment now for the permanent loss of property based on itsfuture expected value under its current use. The SupremeCourt has said that just compensation &quot;means the fullmonetary equivalent of the property taken. The owner is to beout in the same position monetarily as he would have occupiedif his property had not been taken.&quot;   This seems as airtight as a constitutional protection canbe, but for the past half-century judges have often givenunequal protection to certain rights. Many cases havesacrificed what judges call &quot;mere economic rights&quot; (asopposed to what are called higher rights, such as burningflags or displaying obscenities). Courts also distinguishbetween commercial speech, such as advertising, and otherforms of speech that judges defend to the full extent of theFirst Amendment.   As a result of this double standard, the amortizationtheory of compensation to billboard owners has been upheld byseveral courts over the years. Many other courts haverejected it. But even the Bush administration, in the form ofa letter last month from the Department of Transportation toSen. Chafee, says the amortization approach &quot;is notconstitutionally vulnerable.&quot;   This nonchalance ignores the Supreme Court's recentrediscovery of property rights. In a series of opinion in thelate 1980s, the justices began again to protect citizens fromunreasonable takings and inadequate compensation. In the 1987case of Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, the courtsaid California must pay compensation and not merely grant abuilding permit in exchange for a public right of way overbeachfront property. In one of the most recent billboardcases, the Georgia Supreme Court last year cited new U.S.Supreme Court jurisprudence to invalidate amortizationinstead of real compensation for seized billboards.   If the Chafee bill or any other similar scheme becomeslaw, states and localities might be wise not to risk theamortization approach. This is because of a 1987 SupremeCourt opinion that said even a temporary taking of privateproperty by a local government must be compensated. Thismeans that if the courts continue to find the amortizationapproach unconstitutional, local governments will be heldliable for all the lost advertising revenue from expropriatedbillboards. In these tight fiscal times, will localgovernments take the risk?   It's also worth noting who would lose under anyamortization scheme. Some two thirds of the billboardindustry is made up of some 600 small operations with typicalannual revenues of less than $1 million. They would be wipedout. The owners of land along highways who now earn a modestincome from leasing space for billboards would also lose.   It's an irony that the anti-billboard lobby defends theamortization approach because taxpayers can't possibly affordto pay full compensation for the hundreds of thousands ofbillboards the lobbyists want removed. Far from an excuse forundercompensation, this is precisely why the Foundersinsisted on the Takings Clause.   The constitutional requirement that the government mustfully compensate citizens for any seized property is perhapsthe most important limit on the size of government. EastEuropeans, who look forward to a capitalism vibrant enough tosupport billboards, learned this lesson so well that they arewriting similar protections into their new constitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
