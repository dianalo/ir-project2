At 7 a.m. MST, Phoenix was chillier than Anchorage, Alaska, as arelatively warm high pressure mass over Alaska squeezed the coldair southward.   Snow, sleet and freezing rain also pelted the mid-Atlanticstates, closing schools in much of Maryland and Washington, D.C.   Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was 28 degreesbelow zero at International Falls, Minn., and 13 cities in thecentral part of the nation hit record lows.   Morning lows fell below zero from the Dakotas to Michigan. Onthe southwestern tip of Lake Superior, Superior, Wis., hit minus21. Across the harbor from Superior, the low at Duluth, Minn., wasa record 22 below zero. Yankton, S.D., also fell to 22 below, arecord.   Such severe cold doesn't even slow down shoppers in Duluth, saidSusan Latto, director of marketing for the Greater Downtown Council.   ``It actually heightens it,'' she said Tuesday. She said thecold reminds people that winter really is coming and they start``getting serious'' about buying winter clothing.   On the northern Plains, wind combined with the cold to producewind chill effects of 24 below zero at Jamestown, N.D., and 32below at Fargo, N.D., at 6 a.m., the weather service said.   Meteorologist Paul Heidt in Dickinson, N.D., took some of thesting out of that, saying, ``Normally we'll get a cold spell likethis in November. We're overdue.''   Even farther south, at Kansas City, Mo., Tuesday's low was arecord 5 degrees below zero. By late morning, the temperature hadclimed to 14 above zero, the weather service said.   Record low temperatures also were posted in Texas, including 12degrees in Abilene, 8 in El Paso and 10 in Midland.   In the mid-Atlantic states, all public schools and some collegesclosed in Washington, where snow started falling before dawn. Butthe snow stopped at midafternoon in the District of Columbia withonly 1 to 2 inches on the ground.   Most schools in Maryland were closed as a winter storm brushedparts of the state and Delaware with up to 4 inches of snow. Atotal of 8 inches was possible in some areas.   Non-essential Maryland state employees were permitted to takeadvantage of the state's liberal leave policy and Laurel RaceCourse canceled its card because of the snow.   Elsewhere, the cold pushed as far as the normally mild desertSouthwest, where the low in Phoenix was 36 degrees. Even Yuma,Ariz., in the desert near the border with Mexico, chilled to 37degrees.   ``From Canada we have a flow of air straight out of the northfrom southwest Canada. It's coming almost from the Arctic Circle,''said Craig Ellis, head forecaster for the National Weather Serviceoffice in Phoenix.   ``It's because of a very high strong pressure area in the upperatomosphere off the west coast of Alaska,'' he said. ``The warmerair is pushing into Alaska and Canada and forcing the airsouthward.''   Ellis noted that at 7 a.m., when Phoenix hit 37, the temperatureat Anchorage, Alaska, was 45. The temperature climbed to 46degrees, a record high for the date in Anchorage and as warm as anyplace in the continental United States outside Florida or Georgia.   The leading edge of the cold air also pressed into the South,and schools in parts of northern Alabama closed Tuesday inanticipation of sleet and snow that would make travel treacherous.   Rain preceded the snowy cold front, with more than one inchrecorded in the Centreville area of west-central Alabama during a12-hour period beginning at 6 p.m. Monday.   A snow advisory was posted for northern Mississippi. At 7 a.m.,freezing temperatures covered northwestern Mississippi and theweather service said there were patches of snow in northernLouisiana.   Texas citrus and vegetable growers in the Lower Rio GrandeValley braced for the arrival of freezing temperatures. The valueof this year's Texas citrus crop has been estimated at about $89million.   ``We get paranoid this time of year,'' said Bill Weeks,executive vice president of the Texas Citrus and VegetableAssociation in Harlingen.</TEXT></DOC>
