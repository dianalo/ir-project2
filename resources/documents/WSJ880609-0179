I know this because I flew to Washington this week, went to the Voice headquarters and read the editorials that the Voice boomed out in 44 languages to its 130 million listeners. I'd tell you precisely what the editorial said, but I can't: The people at the Voice, who are awfully nice, wouldn't give me a transcript and wouldn't let me make a copy. And even if I had a copy, I couldn't share it with you. It's against the law for me to tell you.    I am not kidding.    It is against the law for anyone to print or broadcast or otherwise &quot;disseminate&quot; in the U.S. anything the Voice of America says. In other words, the 1,204 hours of programing the Voice beamed out last week -- including 15 editorials -- is just a little secret between this government and those 130 million foreigners tuned in to shortwave frequencies fed by the Voice's 113 transmitters.    As I said, I am not kidding.    This has been the law since at least 1972, maybe since 1967 and perhaps since 1948, depending on who is interpreting the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and its subsequent alterations. It's the view of the United States Information Agency, the parent of the Voice, that the prohibition on the American press has existed since 1948.    The law exists, say Voice officials, because Congress didn't want a government-run information agency that could, at least in theory, propagandize the American people. That sounds lofty, but it is absurd. The government -- through its Pentagon public-affairs department, through the Surgeon General's office, through State Department briefings, through countless other devices -- propagandizes the American people every day.    Propaganda, after all, is merely a viewpoint. It becomes corrosive only when it is the lone viewpoint available. The wonderful thing about a democracy is that you are free to hear all viewpoints and then make up your mind.    But in this democracy you can't hear the viewpoint that is financed by $181 million of your taxes each year.    &quot;Every day we shall bring you the truth,&quot; the Voice of America promised in its very first broadcast on Feb. 24, 1942. Well, &quot;if it is truth,&quot; Frank Stanton told the Congress in 1967, &quot;what does it matter who hears it?&quot; Mr. Stanton at the time was president of the Columbia Broadcasting System and chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information. He was trying to get Congress to repeal the prohibition on domestic dissemination of Voice of America information. He failed.    Actually, some Americans can at least look at the transcripts. If you're a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress, you can -- as I did on Monday -- go to Voice headquarters in Washington and read the dispatches sent out by VOA and its sibling, Radio Marti, directed toward Cuba.    &quot;You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying,&quot; a Voice official replied some years ago when I wanted to find out what the VOA was saying. What if I tune in the Voice on my shortwave Sony, transcribe an editorial and print it in my paper? &quot;Nor are you free to reprint such material,&quot; I was advised. That remains the case.    It's unlikely, of course, that the government would seek an injunction should I somehow get a copy of VOA material and print it in the Daily Tribune in Ames, Iowa. &quot;No one would be prosecuted for publishing that information,&quot; a Voice aide predicted to a Minnesota editor.    But that is not the point. The point is that because the information isn't readily available, most newspapers just ignore it. What newspaper can assign someone to keep his ear to a shortwave radio 24 hours a day and quickly tape pertinent broadcasts? As a result, Americans are left ignorant of what their government is saying abroad.    And some care. &quot;I'd like to know what we're telling people in Eastern Europe,&quot; Ralph Rosenberg, an Iowa legislator, says.    It could be of more than passing interest. &quot;VOA editorials deserve close scrutiny. Under the Reagan administration, editorials have become a tool, in many cases the direct mouthpiece of Ronald Reagan, the {National Security Council} and often other people or organizations associated with Reagan policies,&quot; an employee of the Voice of America says in an anonymous letter to the editor in this month's Washington Journalism Review.    &quot;. . . VOA's policy office is the right hand of the NSC, State, and, possibly, friends of {USIA Director Charles} Wick,&quot; the letter writer says. &quot;Sometimes the zealots in VOA's policy department go out of control. Recently, the State Department sent to all overseas points a disclaimer of one VOA editorial, in effect rinsing State's hands of any responsibility of what the VOA had written.&quot;    Shouldn't we know about things like that? Mr. Wick himself professes to think we should. &quot;I agree . . . that it would be useful if your readers could read VOA editorials and decide for themselves about the quality of our message and its delivery,&quot; he wrote me last year. &quot;Unfortunately, that is not possible.&quot;    He went on: &quot;You have, however, raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions.?&quot;    He offered no solutions.    So last week, the Daily Tribune and Mr. Rosenberg, who is a subscriber, and I sued the United States Information Agency in federal court in Des Moines. The Daily Tribune and I asked for the right under the First Amendment to receive and disseminate Voice information. Mr. Rosenberg seeks the right to read it.    It's the first time a news organization has challenged the Voice law, the only American statute that legislates a prior restraint on the press. Except in the most grave circumstances, prior restraints are unconstitutional.    The law has gone unchallenged because historically the Voice sent out non-controversial fare -- straight news and music and current affairs. But the Reagan administration added editorials in 1982, giving Americans a reason to monitor the broadcasts.    The lawsuit is one of 1,652 civil cases pending in Iowa's southern district. If everyone agrees to keep the trial short, it will be held within a year. If the trial is likely to last more than three days, though, it will be two years or more before it comes up.    So until then, the only way you can find out what your government is saying is to ask your Uncle Boris in Minsk or your Aunt Maria in Havana or your cousins who speak Albanian or Amharic or Estonian or Latvian or Urdu or Uzbek. Or, if you have two or three hundred dollars, you could buy a shortwave radio, quit your job and monitor Mr. Wick's operation -- 5995 is the best frequency -- all day and all night.    In any case, if you're interested, stay tuned.    ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune in Ames, Iowa. </TEXT></DOC>
