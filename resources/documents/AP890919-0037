(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A heavily armed teen-ager apparently acting outauthor Stephen King's thriller ``Rage'' took 11 classmates hostageduring a daylong standoff that ended with his surrender after ninehours, authorities said.   No injuries were reported.   Dustin Pierce, a 17-year-old, straight-A student, was detained bypolice Monday evening after he released his last two hostages, laiddown three guns and surrendered.   Charges were not immediately filed.   A copy of ``Rage'' and some personal writings found in Pierce'sroom at his grandparent's house were helpful in giving negotiatorsclues to what he planned, said state police Detective Bob Stephens,who negotiated with Pierce.   Stephens said he had been worried by parts of Pierce's writingthat indicated ``suicide was what we'd have to deal with at theend.''   In King's novel, a teen-ager enraged at his father takes hostagesat a school, is shot and wounded by police and ends up in aninstitution.   Like the character in the book, Pierce was upset with his father,whom he had not seen for 13 years, and asked to see him, authoritiessaid.   Police arranged to have the father, whose name was not released,brought from Delray Beach, Fla., but Pierce surrendered before hisarrival.   The trouble appears to have begun Sunday evening when Pierce'sfriend Brian Bond picked him up at his grandparents' house so thetwo could study together, said Paul Bond, Brian's uncle.   When it became late and they had not returned, authorities werecalled and began searching for Bond's red pickup truck.   The standoff began around 9:30 a.m. Monday, when Pierce and Bondroared into the high school parking lot aboard the truck.   Authorities said that at some point during the disappearancePierce pointed a gun at Bond, in effect abducting him.   Bond, the son of high school principal Betty Bond, was the firsthostage released.   Craig Eversole, a 16-year-old junior, was in the classroom whenPierce entered.   ``He shot the ceiling and told the teacher to leave and let tworows of students leave,'' Eversole said. Later, Pierce fired hisonly other shot, blowing out a classroom window.   Throughout the day, Stephens traded food, cigarettes and softdrinks for hostages.   Stephens said Pierce was solicitous of his hostages, asking forcigarettes on their behalf and even releasing one who needed to goto the bathroom.   ``He said he wasn't going to hurt nobody,'' Eversole said. ``Hesaid he wasn't going to shoot nobody.''   After Pierce's arrival, the students he first released warnedothers and the classrooms were cleared.   Eversole said Pierce was armed with a .357-caliber Magnumrevolver, a .44-caliber revolver and a .12 gauge shotgun that hadbeen altered. ``It looked like one you'd see in a movie,'' Eversolesaid.   More than a dozen state police officers went to the school justsouth of McKee, a town of about 1,000 people some 65 miles southeastof Lexington.   Police were concerned about references in Pierce's writing todying at 9 o'clock. ``He said it'll all end at 9,'' Stephens said.``We didn't want that 9 o'clock hour.''   Pierce surrendered at 6:30 p.m.   Sharon Judd, who had gone to school with Pierce since fourthgrade, called him a quiet, straight-A student who liked guns.   ``Many of the school reports Pierce did dealt with war,'' shesaid.   After taking over the classroom, Pierce's only persistent demandwas to talk to his father, Stephens said.   ``He hasn't seen his father, my understanding, since he's 4 yearsold,'' Stephens said. Pierce had lived with his grandparents forseveral years.   Near the end of the standoff, police called on a cousin and closefriend of Pierce's to convince him no harm would come to him.   Chad Madden, an 18-year-old freshman at nearby Eastern KentuckyUniversity, said he and his cousin talked about hunting.   ``I just talked like I always do,'' Madden said. ``He was calm,pretty smooth. He started to cry a little bit when I was talking.''   At that point, tired and tense, Pierce was looking for a way toend the standoff, Stephens said.   ``He wanted to know how many crimes he committed,'' Stephens said.</TEXT></DOC>
