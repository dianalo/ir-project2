Stiffer Soviet stances threaten to delay armsagreements.   Soviet concessions on long-range missiles have stopped,U.S. officials say. Meanwhile, Soviet negotiators at talks inVienna on conventional forces appear to have gone withoutinstructions from Moscow for weeks. The result may be to slowgoals of wrapping up a strategic-arms treaty by theBush-Gorbachev summit in late May and a conventional-weaponsaccord by November.</LP><TEXT>   Baker and other Bush advisers remain upbeat. They dismissas bargaining tactics recent Soviet efforts to backtrack ontough issues such as sea-launched U.S. cruise missiles. U.S.officials predict easier going when Baker goes to Moscow fora last round of strategic-arms negotiations in May.   Still, the White House begins sending out signals that afull strategic-arms treaty wasn't expected by the summit.                                                                                                          DEFENSE CUTS are put on hold in the Senate until Nunntakes the lead.   The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman carefullyavoids tipping his hand about which weapons he wants cut,angering contractors and other lawmakers. Budget Committeeleaders wait for clear signals from him before voting toshrink Bush defense proposals. Friends say the Georgiasenator is analyzing Pentagon data and taking politicalsoundings before acting.   Nunn's support for two mobile nuclear missiles may beeroding. He urges the White House to trade away therail-based MX missile for Soviet concessions to stopdeploying their own versions. He is likely to seek cuts inBush's $3 billion request for the MX and Midgetman missiles.He hints about trimming requests for Air Force F-16 jets andArmy anti-tank missiles.                                                                                                          NEW DOUBTS about the economy add to worries about thedeficit and Sandamp;Ls.   Recent signs of weakness mean the White House may have torevise its economic forecast downward in July. If so, theresulting budget cuts needed to fit the deficit target couldbe so large that Congress will try to get around theGramm-Rudman law. A new survey of business economists findsonly 20% expect next year's deficit to actually end up belowthe target.   A weaker economy also worsens the thrifts problem. Realestate seized by the feds proves hard to sell. Sandamp;L depositsgrow slowly. And the government pays higher interest ratesthan expected to borrow the billions needed for the bailout.Heavy short-term borrowing for working capital will swell themidsummer deficit forecast under Gramm-Rudman rules.   One possible deficit quick fix: The administration soonmay back a bill to exclude working capital from Gramm-Rudmancalculations.                                                                                                          IRAN-CONTRA PROSECUTOR Walsh plans a report to Congressthat could provide new insights about former PresidentReagan's role in the scandal. Walsh is considering a broaderreport than is required by law in an effort to shed light onsecret White House actions that remain murky despite sevenconvictions.                                                                                                          ODD COMRADES: As conservative North Carolina Sen. Helmsseeks to suspend duties on an ingredient of the anti-ulcerdrug Zantac made in his state, Zantac's British-basedproducer dickers to make the drug also in a Soviet factory inpartnership with state-owned Karl Marx Kombinate. The Helmsbill, an aide notes, affects only the U.S. unit that makesthe drug here.                                                                                                          CLASHES LOOM on the House Commerce Committee betweenchairman Dingell and Rep. Waxman on responding to thegeneric-drugs scandal. Waxman aides seek uniform penaltiesfor misdeeds by makers of generic and of brand-name drugs.Dingell's staff, hoping to avert a fight with thepharmaceutical industry, would limit rules to generic drugs.                                                                                                          CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUPS press Bush not to oppose a bill tosupersede five Supreme Court rulings making job bias harderto prove because he objects to parts of the measure. ActivistRalph Neas warns that Bush would join &quot;Andrew Johnson andRonald Reagan as the only presidents in American history toveto a civil-rights bill.&quot;                                                                                                          PENSION TENSIONS spur bills to head off a potentialSandamp;L-like crisis.   Lawmakers, spooked by the Sandamp;L scandal, move to protect thenation's $2.7 trillion in pension funds. A leading bipartisanproposal by Sens. Kassebaum and Metzenbaum would restrictemployers' ability to terminate pension plans and to tapexcess funds for corporate use. Rep. Lantos considers a billto prevent companies from underfunding pension plans.   Chances are good for a planned enforcement bill based onLabor Department proposals. It would increase pension-fundaudits and the fines for law violations. Currently, pensionfunds are &quot;highly vulnerable to fraud and abuse,&quot; warnsRaymond Maria, the department's acting inspector general.   But a bill by Sens. Kassebaum and Dole aimed at curbingshort-term stock trading by pension funds faces strongopposition.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Texas pundits call Ann Richards's decisivewin in the state's nasty Democratic gubernatorial primary &quot;amudslide.&quot; . . . Priorities: The same day the GAO raised theSandamp;L bailout's estimated cost to $243 billion, regulators atthe Federal Home Loan Bank of New York issued a news releasewelcoming the baseball season. . . . Nyet to Maine? Bushwants to take Gorbachev to his Kennebunkport vacation home,but Soviet planners seem cool to the idea.</TEXT></DOC>
