<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1088 </DOCNO><TEXT>The radiative neutron capture cross sections of Tb and Hf are measuredrelative to that of Au in the energy range from 0.8 to 1.6 MeV usinga large liquid scintillator detector and the time-of-flight method. Thereaction T(p, n){sup 3}He is used to produce neutrons at a pulsed 2.5MeV Van de Graaff. The correction in the scattering process is calculatedby the Monte Carlo method. The present data are compared with other'sand the agreement within the error range is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
