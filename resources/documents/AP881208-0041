Gorbachev will cut short hisvisit to the United States to return to Moscow because of adevastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in threesouthern Soviet republics, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadzesaid Wednesday.   Shevardnadze called a surprise news conference late Wednesdaynight and announced that Gorbachev was to depart prematurelysometime early Thursday.   ``Despite the fact that all emergency measures are being taken... Mr. Gorbachev believes when the people are suffering he has tobe there, he has to lead the efforts,'' Shevardnadze said through anofficial interpreter.   The Soviet foreign minister said the earthquake Wednesday hitArmenia, Azerbaijan and his native Georgia in the Caucasus regionsouth of Moscow. Shevardnadze said the epicenter was near theArmenian town of Leninakan, and the quake registered 8.0, althoughit was not clear whether he was referring to the Richter scale ofground motion or a different Soviet system of calibration.   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quakeregistered 6.9 on the Richter scale.   A 7 reading on the Richter scale is a ``major'' earthquake,capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capableof tremendous damage.   ``I understand that Turkey, too, has been affected, but I don'thave any information,'' Shevardnadze said.   Shevardnadze said Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had flown to theArmenian capital of Yerevan to take charge of emergency reliefoperations.   Gorbachev had been scheduled to travel to Cuba on Friday and onto London Monday before returning to Moscow.   The Soviet foreign minister said Gorbachev would depart earlyThursday. As for the visit to Britain and Cuba, they will take placelater, but at an appropriate time, Shevardnadze said.   ``It's a terrible tragedy not only for the Armenian people butfor all the Soviet people,'' Shevardnadze said. He said the quakehad killed thousands of people, but more accurate figures were notyet available.   Initial word of the sudden change in plans from an official inthe president's entourage who refused to be quoted by name came onlyhours after the top Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I.Gerasimov, told reporters Gorbachev would not abbreviate his visitdue to the earthquake.   Ambassador Yuri Dubinin called White House national securityadviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell at about 11:30 p.m. to tell him thatGorbachev was going home early because of the quake, saidpresidential spokesman B.J. Cooper.   Shevardnadze said that President Reagan and President-electGeorge Bush had expressed their condolences during the lunch meetingwith Gorbachev at Governors Island in New York Harbor, before theextent of the catastrophe became clear to the Soviet delegation.   Reports from the Soviet Union indicated the earthquake causedsevere damage and loss of life in the Caucasus, although itreportedly did not do major damage in Yerevan.   Armenia and the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan also have beentroubled recently by racial strife, leading to the virtualdeclaration of martial law in that region.</TEXT></DOC>
