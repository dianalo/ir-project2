Nowthere is an economy in exile.   Welcome to the new Kuwait. You can find it at the localKuwaiti bank branch here that is suddenly headquarters for amultinational financial giant. And at the London Bridge Cityproperty development along the River Thames. And at the localoffice of the Kuwait state oil company, one of Europe'slargest gasoline retailers. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwaittwo weeks ago, London has become the refuge and headquartersof most of Kuwait's exiled business leaders.</LP><TEXT>   They are keeping their country's vast internationalfinancial and business empire going -- and even thriving --despite the occupation of their home by a foreign power andworld-wide restrictions on asset transfers that hamper normaloperations. &quot;Kuwait's assets can, to a great extent, functionin exile -- however unjust the exile is,&quot; says a spokesmanfor United Bank of Kuwait PLC, a big London-based bank ownedby Kuwaitis.   With $100 billion in overseas investments, Kuwait's wealthlong has given it international economic clout beyond itstiny size. Its economy is three times the size of Greece's.It pumps gasoline from Stockholm to Rome. It commands one ofthe world's largest tanker fleets. It owns U.S. real estate,Malaysian plantations and such blue-chip investments asroughly 14% of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, just under 20% ofchemical giant Hoechst AG and 10% of Britain's Midland BankPLC. In the U.S., it owns Santa Fe International Corp., a SanFrancisco-based oil and gas concern. That global scope hasmade the events since the Iraqi invasion more than justanother scramble by some rich Arabs to get themselves andtheir money out.   Kuwait's senior businessmen, financiers and money managersare gearing up to make their economy-in-exile a force to bereckoned with. If they succeed, they may be able to bringenormous financial influence to bear on the debate over thefuture of their country.   &quot;We may not have been able to defend ourselvesmilitarily,&quot; says a former Kuwaiti cabinet minister now inLondon. &quot;But we have resources.&quot;   And though Kuwaiti politicians haven't made any officialpromises, the average exile-on-the-street in London is allfor using the wealth to bankroll the Western militarycampaign. &quot;If you ask any Kuwaiti, they are ready to pay,&quot;says Abdulla Alsaleh, a Kuwaiti real-estate developer now inexile here. &quot;What Mr. Bush has done is excellent. It's fair.We should pay our part of the cost.&quot;   In a coffee shop in a Kuwaiti neighborhood behindSelfridge's, the posh London department store, the52-year-old Mr. Alsaleh laments that his Kuwaiti credit cardsare now worthless. The local National Bank of Kuwait branch,where he has an account, is limiting withdrawals to #1,000($1,900) a week. And the British private school where heplans to enroll two children this autumn charges #6,000 ayear. &quot;They say they will take it in installments,&quot; he says.&quot;We have to control costs.&quot;   His friend, a Kuwaiti broker at Shearson Lehman Inc.'sLondon office, enters the coffee shop. The broker says hespent the first few days after the invasion calming his manyKuwaiti clients-in-exile, fearful for their investments;they're all safe, though global asset restrictions preventthem from transferring funds out of Britain. Even customersstill trapped in Kuwait aren't entirely cut off. One tradingorder was smuggled out over the desert.   &quot;It's `Desert DHL,'&quot; Mr. Alsaleh chortles.   Mr. Alsaleh, whom the invasion trapped in London while hewas vacationing with his family, affects a jovial mien -- buthe's clearly worried. &quot;I'm trying to organize my life,&quot; hesays. Though he professes confidence that he will one dayreturn to his Kuwaiti business and properties, &quot;it may takesome time.&quot;   While waiting, the Kuwaitis have formed theirfinancial-establishment-in-exile around the nucleus of theKuwait Investment Office, which controls much of Kuwait'sglobal portfolio. Key people include Khaled al-Sabah, deputygeneral manager and chief day-to-day controller of theoffice, who has been in London most of the week. Also inLondon is the governor of the Kuwaiti central bank, andnumerous private bankers. Other officials, from the oilminister to the managing director of the Kuwait InvestmentAuthority -- who escaped overland in a 48-hour dash acrossIraqi lines several days ago -- also are in frequent contactwith London from the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.   In a stuffy conference room across London, the managementboard of National Bank of Kuwait meets in exile, manydirectors having escaped days earlier in furtive trips acrossthe desert.   &quot;We are establishing a sort of informal cabinet,&quot; says asenior Kuwaiti monetary official involved in the group. &quot;Asubstantial portion of the human infrastructure has gottenout of Kuwait. With the assets and people out of the hands ofthe invading powers, Kuwait is able to pull its act togetherand reorganize to be more effective -- no matter how long ittakes for the situation to go back to normal.&quot;   For the moment, the situation is anything but normal. Theasset freeze imposed by most Western governments meansKuwaiti holdings overseas generally can't be moved acrossborders or disbursed. But U.S. and U.K. authorities, inparticular, have been flexible with the exiled Kuwaitibusinessmen; Kuwait Petroleum, for instance, can now transferfunds around its European operations. And most privateWestern bankers, on the advice of their countries' centralbanks, have resumed many dealings with the Kuwaitis. Acrucial factor in gaining this status, bankers say, was thatso many of their countries' exiled financial leaders weredirectly on hand in London to prove to authorities that they-- and not Iraq -- were in control of the Kuwaiti assets.   Thus, in the New Bond Street offices of Kuwait Petroleum,an unusual drama is unfolding of an oil giant making dowithout a home country or its own oil. The company, operatingin Europe under the apt &quot;Q8&quot; brand name, owns a vast networkof 6,533 gasoline stations and three refineries, also inEurope, to retail Kuwaiti petroleum products. Now, under itsexiled directors, it's scrambling to keep the business goingby buying oil from others. Competitors confirm it issucceeding.   &quot;We're optimistic&quot; about securing Saudi crude, says DavidRobson, marketing director of Kuwait Petroleum InternationalLtd., the company's European marketing arm. &quot;We will continuelike any other oil company,&quot; buying oil from producers andrefining and marketing it.   At the investment office, officials also have succeeded --with the aid of the Bank of England -- in ensuring the officecan continue to invest with some semblance of normalcy. Buttraders and bankers familiar with the investment officesuggest that the upheaval caused by the asset freeze may leadthe agency -- which had become a more-aggressive investor inrecent years -- to lower its profile. The office may raisecash and reduce its long-term block holdings, they say.   The logic behind such a move, traders say, is that itwould keep the fund more liquid to provide capital to theKuwaiti government in exile and avoid possible investmentrestrictions by governments concerned about the strategicramifications of a large Kuwaiti holding.   Officials of the Kuwait Investment Office declined tocomment for this article.   As news of Iraq's invasion rocked the world financialmarkets nearly two weeks ago, fund managers at the Kuwaitioffice and other Arab funds in London quickly decided toreduce their exposure to the markets.   Kuwaiti financial executives &quot;wanted to be liquid&quot;immediately following the invasion, says Robert L. Thomas,director at Midland Bank PLC's Midland Montagu internationalfinancial unit, a London institution that trades with theKuwaiti office.   Over the longer term, the asset freeze raises legalquestions that could lead to years of litigation amongKuwaitis with claims to the assets and banks withcounterclaims. &quot;There is too much money just to sit there forfive or six years,&quot; says Prof. Harold Koh, an internationallaw expert at Yale Law School.   The biggest question is who owns the assets. In the longterm, the assets belong to the Kuwaiti people, most of whomare still in the country. Indeed, the investment office'sreason for existence is to invest the proceeds of oil revenueto benefit future generations when the wells run dry.However, the entity that has always controlled the assets isthe internationally recognized Kuwaiti government -- now inexile -- which would seem to have strongest legal claim tomanaging the holdings.   Kuwait continues to have expenses for its embassies andfor its ruling family -- and these claims are likely to bethe first to cross central bankers' desks.
