Herald on oil spill prevention andlegislation:   The Exxon Valdez is safely berthed in San Diego for the nextnine months, but the oil issue itself will be with us for muchlonger than that.   The Senate, for example, is nearing approval of a bill togreatly increase the oil industry's liability for spills and toestablish a $1 billion cleanup fund and disaster response teamsalong the nation's coast. More legislation, more studies and moreattention can be expected.   An internal Coast Guard study, recently released by the Housesubcommittee on water, power and offshore energy, once again raisesthe issue of double hulling for tankers.   The study criticizes the single-bottom structure of the ExxonValdez. Double bottoms, the study maintains, ``are effective inreducing the potential oil outflow from grounding.''   Tanker transportation may indeed require different safetyprecautions depending on the nature of the cargo and the sea to besailed. Not debatable is the need for enforceable precautions. Theyshould be a matter of law.   The oil industry, the Coast Guard and Congress must work toagree on safety measures to protect the nation's waterways. Delaymerely courts disaster.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 3   The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on protecting the ozonelayer:   In the 1987 Montreal Protocol, 38 countries meeting in Canadaagreed to tackle the problem of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Thoseare gases blamed for destroying the planet's protective ozonelayer. Some positive responses are coming in.   Nissan Motor Co. is the first of Japan's major automakers tobegin cutting back on CFCs. Nissan announced ... that it willtotally ban CFC use by 1993.   In the United States, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. says itintends to eliminate all CFC emissions from its factories by 1994.ATandamp;T becomes the first American electronics manufacturer to setsuch a goal. Part of that effort is to cut emissions in half by1991. The company already has a policy of not accepting anyCFC-made packaging from suppliers.   While these two instances may not seem sufficient _ given themassive use of CFCs worldwide in manufacturing _ they aresignificant in that they come from firms regarded as worldwideheavyweights. ATandamp;T and Nissan set admirable standards in theirapproach to cutting emissions.   Here's hoping the rest of the world follows their lead.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 7   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on capital gains taxes:   They laughed when George Bush campaigned last year in favor oflowering capital gains taxes. Democrats claimed it was just a wayto feather the nests of the wealthy, and since they control bothhouses of Congress, that was supposedly it.   But lo and behold, a majority of the key House Ways and MeansCommittee lined up the other day in favor of a bill to reduce thetax people owe on the gains they make on the sale of stocks andother assets. Such capital gains are now taxed the same as ordinaryincome, at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, dependingon total income.   President Bush has proposed a top capital gains rate of 15percent. He may not get that. Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., hasintroduced a bill that would have a maximum 20 percent rate for twoyears, and then a 28 percent rate.   A bare majority of the committee, 13 Republicans and sixDemocrats, support the Jenkins measure. Both proposals would lowertaxes for about 7.9 million couples or individuals.   Democratic leaders are accusing President Bush of trying todismantle the 1986 Tax Reform Law. This measure changed thefavorable treatment of capital gains to make them conform withordinary income.   But the administration offers compelling arguments that givingtaxpayers a break on such gains will boost the economy. It wouldencourage savings and reduce costs of investment for U.S business.It also would afford a hefty boost in revenues next year asinvestors moved to realize capital gains on assets that otherwisewould remain untaxed. This would help ease the still-troublingdeficit problems. ...   Such factors, plus the definite boost to the economy, offerpersuasive evidence on the need for more favorable treatment ofcapital gains.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 6   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on savings by Americans:   Americans don't save enough, and that poses a serious andlong-range problem. This fall the Bush administration plans tobegin a campaign to urge all of us to salt away more of ourearnings.   In 1987 the personal savings rate sank to a 40-year low of 3.2percent. Last year saw only slight improvement.   We predict an upturn in the savings rate regardless of thedegree of success of the administration's urging. The Baby Boomgeneration is now moving into middle age. Middle age is the peakperiod for saving. Earnings are at a peak at the same time the needfor saving grows increasingly apparent.   Taking the long view, savings must be encouraged. If they arenot, America will almost surely see its standing among the leadingindustrial nations further eroded. Savings means investment,investment means new businesses, and new businesses mean new jobs.   But it's going to take some doing. It won't be easy to changeAmericans from big spenders to frugal penny-pinchers who haverelearned the adage: ``A penny saved is a penny earned.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
