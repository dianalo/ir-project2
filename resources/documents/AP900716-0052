The army waited until late Saturday night to publicize theincident. The missing West German-made aircraft is of a type oftenused for reconnaissance. The military would not say whether it wasequipped with weapons.

Newspapers identified the pilot by the name Captain H. and saidhe was studying for a doctorate in physics at Technion, aprestigious scientific institute in Haifa. They said he had beenhaving maritial problems and was not living with his wife.   ``H. was a strange guy who wasn't accepted by society,'' afriend of the pilot told the Al Hamishmar newspaper.
