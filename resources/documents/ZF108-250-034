Ellison, Carol.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Tips and guidelines for building effective graphical businesspresentations using microcomputer software are presented.andP;  Themost important rule in developing a presentation is to understandthe subject matter and audience.andP;  A presentation has three basicparts: the introduction, which encompasses the topic, theme, andgoals; the body, which lays out information and emphasizespersuasive points; and the conclusion, which demonstrates how thefacts or arguments presented lead to the goal.andP;  Organizing thepresentation is an important step and should begin with thedevelopment of a storyboard.andP;  Words should remain at the core ofevery image, with graphics providing a background designed toreinforce the text.andP;  Words should be strong and typefaces keptsimple.andP;  Consistency and simplicity are vital to the design ofgood presentation images.andP;  Bar charts are useful for comparisons,while line charts show trends and pie charts indicate percentages.andO;Combining chart types may be effective but should be donesparingly.andP;  Graphic elements enhance text and give presentations adistinguishing look but should be well placed.andP;  Today'spresentation software and hardware allows elaborate specialeffects, but users should carefully review how much real-worldbenefit will result from their use.andP;  The presenter should practiceboth reviewing images and rehearsing the spoken part of thepresentation.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     PresentationsTutorialGuidelines.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Image PowerandM;1 Understand your subjectandM;and your audienceandM;GREAT GRAPHICS ALONE won't guarantee a successful presentation.andP;  Consider thewaste of connecting superb stereo speakers to an ailing amplifier.andP;  All theycan do is faithfully reproduce distorted sound.andP;  In a similar way, greatgraphics can't rescue a poorly conceptualized, badly organized presentation.andO;In fact, like those speakers, great graphics can brilliantly exhibit theflaws and do more harm than good.andM;Therefore, the first step in producing effective graphics presentations musttake place in your mind, not in your computer.andM;As David Gould, assistant vice president of marketing development forinternational cruise firm Cunard Line, advises, &quot;Before any of us give apresentation, we have to give a lot of consideration to how we're going topresent our thoughts.andP;  This way, the presentation is much more efficient,much more organized, and more likely to get action.&quot;andM;What's the purpose of your presentation?andP;  To inform?andP;  To persuade?andP;  Toexcite?andP;  To put good spin on bad news?andM;What is its goal?andP;  To win a contract?andP;  To sell a product or service?andP;  Todefend a position?andP;  To introduce an idea?andM;Don't take another step in your presentation until you have satisfactoryanswers to those questions.andP;  They color every decision you will make aboutthe form and content of your graphics.andM;One effective technique for focusing your thoughts on a topic is to develop adetailed working title.andP;  The title should reflect not only your subject butyour goal as well.andP;  For example:andM;&quot;PC Presentations: Eight Rules You Can Use to Make Money.&quot;andP;  The titleindicates an informative presentation with the goal of getting the audienceto act on the information, with money as the motivating factor.andM;&quot;The Time Has Come to Try PC Presentations.&quot;andP;  This title suits a persuasivepresentation on the same subject; the goal here is convincing the audiencethat this statement is true.andM;&quot;Eight Real-World Experiences with PC Graphics, and What They Mean for you.&quot;andO;Here we have an anecdotal approach to this topic, a well-illustrated,informational sampler that lets the audience members choose the informationthey want from your report.andM;And just what will you audience want?andP;  More than any other factor, the peopleyou're trying to reach determine the form and style your presentation shouldtake.andP;  A great presentation is tuned to the audience.andP;  Who will beexperiencing this presentation?andP;  What are their hot buttons?andP;  Are theyconservative, radical, happy-go-lucky, fixated on the bottom line?andP;  What istheir income, education, social, and professional level?andP;  How muchinformation and interest do they bring to the topic of your presentations?andM;Keep in mind, during these deliberations, the role you see for each of yourpresentation's three basic parts.andP;  The introduction, which usually takesabout 10 percent of your presentation time, encompasses the topic, theme, and goals of the talk.andP;  It lets the audience know what the experience of thepresentation will be.andP;  The body of the talk, up to 70 percent of thematerial, presents your information or lays out your persuasive points.andP;  Theconclusion, 20 percent or so of the presentation, reviews the facts or thearguments presented and demonstrates how they lead to the goal you announcedin the introduction.andM;It's the classic model: Tell 'em what you're going to tell 'em.andP;  Tell 'em.andO;Then tell 'em what you told 'em.andM;Only when you intimately understand your subject, your audience, and thebasic form of your presentation will you be able to use graphics techniqueseffectively.andP;  You must, as the Me Generation aphorism attests, know whereyou're going if you ever want to get there.andM;2 Organize your presentationandM;ONCE YOU'VE GOT a handle on your subject and audience, start sketching aspecific organization of points that will get you to your goal.andM;A few simple rules can help you shuffle your ideas into presentation form:andM;Develop a consistent organizational theme suited to your subject and goal.andO;Informational presentations, for instance, can be organized by topic: income,expenses, acquisitions, problems, plans.andP;  Or they can be set up to tracecauses and effects:andM;Products Are Late Market Share Is Down Expenses Are Up Profits HaveNose-dived.andM;They can move around geographically or organizationally, like a map:andM;East Coast Sales West Coast Sales European Sales Our Sales ManagementOrganization Chart.andM;They can move through time:andM;1981--We Are Founded 1983--We Deliver Our First Product 1985--We Break $1Million in Sales 1988--We Merge with Acme.andM;Some organizational setups work best when your talk aims to persuade as wellas inform.andP;  Try the problem-solution approach.andP;  For example, Our Prices HaveBeen Too High: How We Can Cut Costs and Prices.andM;The opposing-points-of-view approach: We Should Buy Acme, Five Reasons Why.andO;We Shouldn't Buy Acme, Five Reasons Why.andM;The step-by-step approach, in which you move from the area of greatestagreement toward a more controversial position: We have money.andP;  We lackmarket share.andP;  Acme has market share.andP;  It needs money.andP;  We should buy Acme.andM;Remember that the role of individual graphics in a presentation is like thatof spice in a stew, bringing flavor, texture, and color.andP;  You and your ideas,not the slides, are the meat.andP;  So, in an opposing-points-of-viewpresentation, your job is to present both sides and then argue in favor ofone.andP;  In an effective presentation, the focus remains on the presenter, noton the graphics.andM;The best way to begin developing your presentation structure is with astoryboard.andP;  A presenter's storyboard is the equivalent of the designer'sdrawing board or the writer's outline.andP;  It's a blueprint that helps you matchvisual images with your verbal message.andM;A storyboard should start as an outline of the main facts or points that youwant to present.andP;  Use your word processor or outlining program for thesefirst stages, because they are more flexible with words than are graphicspackages, and they have spell-checking and thesaurus capabilities thatpresentation programs lack.andM;Type in lists of key points and insert page breaks after each naturalbreaking point.andP;  Move these &quot;pages&quot; around, trying different organizationalconfigurations until you hit on one that works for you.andP;  Then note on each&quot;page&quot; the background information critical to supporting that point, alongwith any ideas about numbers or graphics elements that could bolster thatsegment of the presentation.andP;  Let the storyboard become as sloppy andcluttered as your ideas demand.andP;  For now, keep your thinking free.andP;  You cantidy it all up later.andM;When you're satisfied with the flow of the storyboard, work on yourintroductory and concluding points and images.andP;  Make sure the body worksbefore you tackle the ends.andM;After you've done this, print the &quot;pages.&quot;andP;  Read and revise.andP;  Repeat theprocess until you can't think of any way to improve the structure or thepoints you are making on each page.andM;Only at this point will you be ready to create actual images.andM;3 Build images with wordsandM;at the coreandM;WORDS SHOULD BE the heart of the visuals you create.andP;  Visuals represent thecredibility of your presentation, reinforcing your spoken words.andP;  During thepresentation, words onscreen can double as cue cards, keeping you relaxed,focused, and comfortable.andP;  They may also free you from relying on a script ornotes, thereby allowing you to walk around the room, projecting greaterconfidence than you would if you remained riveted, eyes-to-paper, behind apodium.andM;Start by importing into your graphics software the storyboard text &quot;pages&quot;you have developed.andP;  Virtually all graphics packages accept standard ASCIItext files created on word processors.andM;Next, decide how your words should be organized when each &quot;page&quot; becomes adisplayable image.andP;  Options include:andM;Bullet Charts.andP;  Here, each idea stands on its own line and is set off with asmall symbol--a dot, an arrow, a star.andP;  With bullet charts, which are easy tocreate and an asset in focusing your thoughts, spectators can closely followyou point by point as you speak.andP;  If the notes you've made in your outlinedon't fall neatly into a bullet chart, something is wrong with the structureof your information or argument.andP;  Rethink.andM;Build Series.andP;  This variation of the bullet chart is especially handy foremphasizing brief points or building elements in a logical argument.andP;  Buildsretain information from the previous slide onscreen and then &quot;build&quot; newitems around it.andP;  This avoids the flash-card effect of passing too quicklythrough completely independent images.andP;  Also, it impresses early points morefirmly in viewers' minds.andP;  The Florida Power andamp; Light presentation, on theopposite page, won an international management award with a presentation thatused a build series.andM;Title Charts.andP;  The opening image of your presentation may serve as a kind oftitle page for the talk.andP;  Similarly, you can create title images for majorsections of your presentation.andM;Column Charts.andP;  Imagine that you're evaluating two acquisition proposals.andO;With a column chart, you can list the salient points of comparison side byside.andM;Text.andP;  Simply displaying text is another option.andP;  Quotations, for instance.andO;Mission statements.andP;  Watchwords from the founder.andP;  While a graphicspresentation should never display text just as it would be seen on paper,occasional text displays can garner resoundingly good results.andM;Whichever form of text display you use, follow these guidelines:andM;* Never use more than six to eight words per line.andM;* Never use more than six to eight lines per chart.andM;* Never use more than 50 words per chart.andM;* Use consistent language.andM;* Stick to a single idea per line.andM;* Be brief.andP;  The slide shouldn't contain everything you intend to say.andO;That's why you're there.andM;* Keep language concrete and specific.andP;  Use expressive verbs and nouns.andM;* Read slowly to yourself all the items proposed for a single image.andP;  If youcan't read the slide comfortably in 30 seconds or less, simplify the image.andM;Once you've chosen your words, select suitable typefaces for their display.andO;Here again, simplicity should reign.andP;  Choose one or two attractive fonts andstick with them.andP;  Serif fonts (traditional type with thick and thin lines andanchoring feet) and script fonts are fine for large items, such as titles,because they can look bold and distinctive.andP;  However, sans serif type(simple, uniform-width lines with no feet) is best for text because it'seasier to read.andP;  Strive for similarity in the overall appearance of textslides.andP;  If you start with full sentences, introduced by stars, do sothroughout.andP;  If you're designing a bullet chart, keep the same style andcolor of bullets throughout the presentation.andM;A final pointer on type: Line up type evenly on the left with the rightmargin ragged.andP;  Justified margins may create unsightly gaps between words.andM;4 Create consistent imagesandM;NOW YOU CAN use the software's features to transform the raw words intopowerful images.andP;  The problem you'll face at this stage isn't finding niftythings to do with your text.andP;  On the contrary, you'll suffer from an overabundance of riches.andP;  PC graphics packages today can do anything this side ofpainting the Sistine Chapel.andP;  The options are so many and so mouth-watering,you'll have to steel yourself to use as few of them as possible.andM;Imagine your graphics software as a gorgeous brunch buffet.andP;  Just because allthose luscious dishes are heaped on the groaning board doesn't mean it'shealthy to try them all.andM;When it comes to presentations, consistency and simplicity must prevail.andO;Your purpose is not to overwhelm your audience with graphics but to achieveyour real-world goal.andM;Keep these points in mind:andM;Medium.andP;  Decide which presentation medium to use.andP;  Slides, overheadtransparencies, PC screenshows, and hardcopy all have their benefits.andP;  (See&quot;Which Medium Is Right for Your Message?&quot; on page 78.)andP;  Also, know how to usethe medium you choose to its best advantage.andP;  For instance, with slides youshould favor solid backgrounds and shading.andP;  With overheads, cross-hatchingstands out better.andP;  Remember, too, that media are not exclusive.andP;  ContinentalGrain used highly conceptual slides to convey the core of a tough idea to anequally tough crowd: top management.andP;  Then the presenters ensured that theaudience would get the complete message by distributing printed handouts withthe full text of the presentation alongside copies of the visuals.andM;Color.andP;  Use color combinations as visual cues, but use them uniformly.andP;  Don'tdistract your audience by jumping from blue to black to green backgrounds.andO;Blue works best as a background for slides because it is soft on the eye andemotionally neutral.andP;  Other colors have very strong associations, such as redand green for Christmas.andP;  Keep in mind that color must be chosen to serve thereport, not to satisfy a personal preference.andM;Contrast.andP;  Use light type against a consistent background color for bestvisibility.andP;  Most of the images illustrating this story have light letters ona blue background, a combination that ensures easy readability.andP;  Both theCoors (page 70) and the Florida Power andamp; Light (page 74) images prove thispoint convincingly.andP;  When colors used on a slide are too similar, they muddythe view.andP;  When type sizes and styles aren't clearly differentiated, theimage loses definition.andM;Consistency.andP;  Whatever decisions you make about the look of your images,apply them throughout the presentation.andP;  Consider your entire set ofimages--whether 10 or 10,000--as a single design, not as a mass of individualdesigns.andP;  While consistency is always a virtue in a presentation, particularvalue comes when you adhere to well-established principles for layout:andM;* Elements in an image should be centered in relation to the edges.andP;  Thisbalances the image and keeps the viewer's eye on the center.andM;* A small object displayed against a large field commands more attention thandoes a large object in a large field.andP;  A balance of filled and empty spaceactually makes the image stronger.andM;* Rules (horizontal or vertical lines) can create zones.andP;  Titles might beabove the line, information below.andP;  Consistency in titles and rules can trainthe audience to know where to look on each image.andM;If you're on a short deadline and feel you can get by with text-based images,you can get a professional service bureau to create 35mm slides directly fromASCII files.andP;  Brilliant Image, in New York City, for instance, will createslides within 24 hours for as little as $8 a slide.andP;  Simply send the file ofimages by modem, with instructions on fonts and background color.andP;  (See&quot;Where Can You Go When You Need Help?&quot; on page 80.)andM;5 Graph the essential dataandM;THE OTHER MAJOR graphics element to consider for your images is thedata-driven chart, the visual expression of information essential to yourpresentation.andP;  At the most basic level, this could be a table of raw numbersimported as ASCII characters.andP;  That's simple, of course, and is howspreadsheets are set up, but it won't work in a presentation.andP;  Numbers areboring and hard to see onscreen.andP;  Instead, select a chart appropriate to yourinformation.andP;  All graphics packages can create charts; each has its benefitsand drawbacks:andM;Bar Charts.andP;  These charts are best for comparing totals.andP;  Coors used barcharts effectively to juxtapose profits in the beverage industry and mediaspending among beer producers (see page 70).andM;Line or Area Charts.andP;  Directional trends are best illustrated this way.andO;Coors's line chart shows shifting age-group patterns, and Continental Grain'sarea chart displays variations in shrimp production (see page 82).andM;Whether you're charting bars, lines, or areas, it's important always toidentify the x and y axes--either in the chart title (as Coors did) or inaxis labels--so the audience can grasp the graphic's point at a glance.andM;Pie Charts.andP;  Though perfect for showing relative proportions--fractions andpercentages--pie charts are inadequate for just about everything else.andP;  Theyhave no axes, so they are not effective in showing numbers, trends, orvolumes.andP;  A good pie chart, for that matter, need not even include numbers;it's the size of the slice that counts.andP;  You'd get the point of the CoorsMarket Segment slide even if it had no specific values on it.andM;Although most PC graphics programs let you put more than one pie onscreen ata time, doing so is a bad idea.andP;  With more than one pie, the viewers' eyestravel from one pie to another, struggling to decipher correlations andcontrasts.andM;You should scratch the idea of using pie charts if a single pie doesn't tellyour story.andP;  Instead, tell it with a clustered or stacked bar chart.andP;  Coorsused a clustered bar chart to compare several industry packaging trends over12 years; Continental Grain used stacked bars to show the growth ofaquaculture in worldwide fishery production.andM;Even with bar charts, be careful to limit the number of items you represent.andO;In a clustered bar chart, three items are optimum and five or more aredangerous.andP;  In a stack, any more than two bars can confuse comparisons.andM;You can also combine chart types.andP;  Lines fit neatly over bars to show howvolumes compare with trends (for instance, how company profits over fiveyears relate to total sales of a product).andM;Make sure your data charts share all the graphics attributes of your wordcharts.andP;  Use the same text, background colors, and fonts, and maintain aconsistent color scheme for similar data across all charts.andP;  Color coding isa wonderful visual trick that helps make quick sense of a chart; Coors usedits company color (&quot;Coors red&quot;) to represent company data in all its bar andpie charts.andM;As with word charts, changing colors for variety's sake can confuse themessage.andP;  And be particularly careful of potential subliminal impact: red,for instance, shouldn't show up in a financial chart unless you use it tocall attention to a deficit.andM;When you've figured out what kind of graphics to display and which data topresent visually, go back to your hard disk to root out the goods.andP;  The primedirective here: Be selective.andP;  Import into your graphics software preciselywhat you'll need for your charts, and nothing else.andM;Several programs (including Freelance Plus, Graphwriter, Harvard Graphics,and Graph Plus) let you hotlink your chart to a spreadsheet.andP;  Hotlinksautomatically update the chart whenever the data changes.andP;  This is a greattime-saver for people who regularly make presentations from the same data(quarterly sales figures, for example).andM;6 Add the graphics elementsandM;ENHANCE TEXT, AN image, or a chart by simply adding the company logo or a fewbasic graphics elements.andP;  Florida Power andamp; Light's logo appears in the lowerright corner of each slide and is anchored with a bold white line.andP;  Theimages also use a recurring illustration of Florida's outline to connect abuild series reviewing operating sectors.andP;  Such elements can establishconsistency among charts and remind viewers who the sponsor is.andM;Coors took this concept even further.andP;  All slides for its presentation toPizza Hut feature a blue background, white text, a mountain range along thebottom, and the logos of Coors and Pizza Hut.andP;  This brings an entertainingand energetic, but still uniform, look to the entire presentation andemphasizes Coors's Rocky Mountain heritage.andM;Most graphics programs allow you to create or select graphics elements andapply them consistently to many images, establishing visual templates foryour presentation.andP;  Templates not only bring a smooth, professional look tothe design, they also save you precious time by freeing you from having tobuild each part of each image.andP;  Most graphics programs offer precomposedtemplates that make many design choices for you.andP;  If your software doesn'tprovide templates, create your own.andP;  Determine standard features for thepresentation: background and foreground colors, fonts, shape and size ofbullets in text charts, drop shadows (which make text appear to stand outfrom the page), and motifs repeated across images.andP;  Then pull those imagesfrom memory to complete each image.andM;Once you've chosen a location for a logo, keep it there.andP;  Logos that bouncearound distract an audience as readily as quick-change colors.andM;More complex graphics elements, such as illustrations, can be blessing orbane to a presentation.andP;  The problem is that if they're fantastic, they candraw attention away from you and your message.andP;  If they aren't so great, theycan diminish the aura of professionalism and success surrounding yourpresentation.andP;  Cunard Line's presentation (page 88) effectively usesillustration.andM;Its audience influenced Cunard's decision not to use word-oriented charts tolist new cruise destinations and ship features in its World Clubpresentation.andP;  The presentation was meant to explain a key marketinginitiative, the company's frequent-passenger program, to international staff.andO;The importance of the presentation, and the fact that English was a secondlanguage to many in the audience, justified the time spent creatingillustrations that would get the point across a linguistic gap.andP;  It worked.andO;&quot;We got a lot of people leaning forward in their seats.andP;  Not only were wetrying to hold the attention of the audience through a very longpresentation, we were trying to hold the attention of people whose firstlanguage isn't English,&quot; says David Gould, Cunard's assistant vice presidentof marketing development and the creator of the presentation.andM;Coors built illustrations neatly into its template by using a beer mug thatframes lists, as seen in the depiction of top beer brands (page 70).andP;  Thistechnique worked for Coors because the illustration is so clearly associatedwith the company.andM;Both Coors and Cunard used clip art--graphics images that are either soldwith or added to PC graphics programs.andP;  Clip art is fast and cheap, and itallows the ham-handed to create images without drawing them.andP;  Thedisadvantage to clip art images is a certain generic quality.andP;  Since they aredesigned for all seasons, they aren't perfect for one.andM;The artistry in Continental Grain's presentation (page 82) shows what'spossible, though not commonplace, if the full range of capabilities in PCgraphics is brought to bear on a presentation.andP;  These customized images comefrom the professional artists at Brilliant Image--beautiful, but far moreexpensive than presentations done in-house with standard business graphicssoftware.andM;8 surefire rules and 4 real-world examples you can follow to producepresentations that pay off.andP;  By Mike Edelhart and Carol EllisonandM;SOME PICTURES can be worth far more than a thousand words, especially ifPC-based presentations are involved.andM;PC-generated graphics have made a world of difference to the Coors BrewingCompany.andP;  Armed with a PC-produced set of slides for its presentations, theGolden, Colorado, company managed to brew lucrative contracts with Pizza Hut,Circle K, 7-Eleven, and Safeway.andM;At a tiny division of New York's mammoth Continental Grain, aPC-graphics-laced fish story on the profits of aquaculture hooked thecorporate brass, netting the go-ahead for a new venture.andM;And a PC presentation by the Florida Power andamp; Light Company proved theutility's extraordinary efficiency, helping Miami-based FPandamp;L win theprestigious Deming Prize last year for industrial quality control--and baskin the public spotlight.andM;Although these presentations reflect divergent goals and the differentgraphics software used to attain them, they share a common feature: Theytransform PC graphics into persuasive presentations that pay off in power andprofits.andM;How can you put yourself and your company into such profitable andprestigious pictures--pictures that help you make your point, deliver yourpitch, and sell your product?andP;  The key doesn't lie in merely selecting one ofthe many presentation graphics packages--they all offer broad potentialbenefits.andP;  The key is making that potential actual, squeezing the real-worldbenefit from the power that's packed into such programs.andP;  The companies whosepresentations are displayed on the following pages have done just that.andP;  Andtheir successes, for all the originality and variety they reflect, follow asimple, central set of principles.andP;  These eight guiding rules of thumb pointthe way to exemplary PC presentations.andM;7 Use special effectsandM;at your own riskandM;WELL-BLENDED TEXT, charts, and consistent support graphics should satisfyalmost any presentation need.andP;  But if you hunger for more, you can turn toany number of specialized PC graphics programs.andP;  Or load your PC with acollection of boards to create a true multimedia extravaganza.andP;  Specialsoftware (and combinations of software and hardware) now lets you animateyour productions, synchronize them to music, apply sound effects, bring videosignals to your PC, and send PC signals out to video.andM;Before you cast yourself as Steven Spielberg in pinstripes, though, askyourself whether you really need or want all this sound and action.andP;  Specialeffects are excellent attention-getters for public presentations andpoint-of-sale displays, but they can seem frivolous in the conservativebusiness world.andM;Avoid the allure of using these bells and whistles for their own sake.andP;  Thelatest and greatest may not always be the best.andP;  How will adding motion orsound or pyrotechnics bring you and your audience closer?andP;  How can increasedcomplexity in your graphics lead to greater clarity in your presentation?andO;Where is the payoff--in real-world benefit, not just in personalsatisfaction--to offset the effort these extra elements require?andM;Animation and other effects have their place, to be sure.andP;  You can drive homea message about change, for instance, by using animation to enlarge bars in asales chart or to present a new product design that includes moving parts.andO;Animation is also helpful in conditional or branching situations: We couldfollow course A (movement) or course B (return to start and show newmovement).andP;  Sound can create an immediate sense of place or person--thechirping of birds, the throb of engines, the bang of success.andP;  It can alsostimulate an audience's attention during a long or complex presentation.andM;Traditionally, getting hold of these high-end capabilities with a PC has beenmore than a little bother.andP;  Animation requires VGA graphics and tons of RAM.andO;Video takes specialized hardware, such as a Targa board.andP;  Even sound demandsspecial boards.andP;  These goodies can produce dramatic effects, but can vastlyraise your presentation's ante.andP;  They demand time, both to learn and to use.andO;And they soak up money, which can push a presentation beyond budgetaryjustification.andM;However, it's not absolutely necessary to spend a fortune and become agraphics pro in order to gussy up your presentation.andP;  You may find all theanimation your business environment needs in the screenshow feature of yourgraphics software: it lets you display the images created by PC software on aPC screen.andP;  Because the image remains under the computer's control, you canstill use the software to manipulate overheads or printed handouts, whichisn't possible with slides.andM;You can use screenshows to segue between images with fades (an old imagefades out as the new one fades in), scrolls (an image splits at its centerand scrolls off the sides of the screen), and dissolves (an old imagescatters off the screen).andP;  But use these, too, with caution.andP;  Some of themore interesting effects--such as &quot;rain,&quot; which streaks images onto thescreen--often call so much attention to themselves that they distract theaudience.andM;The other drawback of screenshows is that they can be effective only withgroups that are small enough to crowd around a PC's screen--unless you'rewilling to get involved with special projection devices, which makepresentation preparation all the more complex.andM;Happily, a new class of software designed to tie high-end effects intomainstream presentations is emerging.andP;  IBM's Storyboard Plus, for instance,brings new ease to special effects.andP;  Autodesk's Animator allows mere mortalsto produce stunning moving images.andP;  This may be the year when PC specialeffects become practical.andM;8 Review and practiceandM;BEFORE YOU ASSEMBLE your images into a show, make sure you're satisfied withthe flow of your spoken message and the visuals you've created.andP;  Many PCgraphics products can help you edit your images.andM;The Portfolio feature in Freelance Plus is one of the finest tools availablefor this task.andP;  In it, you link the filename of each graphic with a shortdescriptive phrase.andP;  When you're finished, the phrases serve as a finaloutline that you can review to ensure that you've aligned the images to makethe proper points in the proper order.andP;  With this tool, you can edit theorder of the images and delete redundant or extraneous charts.andM;Computer Associates' Cricket Presents for Microsoft Windows (formerly XeroxPresents) offers similar functions in a more graphic, interactive style.andP;  ItsSort by Image and Sort by Title capabilities let you call miniature images ofyour charts onto the screen.andP;  Then, with the mouse, you can drag them intothe order you want.andM;Editing images on a PC screen is not the end of the presentation process,however.andP;  Unless you're creating a standalone point-of-sale display, PCgraphics won't--and shouldn't--carry your message by themselves.andP;  Much of thechallenge of a successful presentation is yours.andP;  So, as the process ofbuilding a presentation began with you, it also ends with you.andP;  You must tunethe human instrument to make a winning presentation.andM;To a large extent this means getting up and walking away from the PC.andP;  Havingbeen through the process of building images to support your presentation, youmust take some time to review your goals for the presentation and how youbelieve each PC image fits into that plan.andP;  If you have a written script,this is the time to refine it, subject it to one more critical pass.andM;Once your mind is set, you'll find that the screenshow feature of yourgraphics software is a great rehearsal medium, even if you plan to useslides, overheads, or handouts in the actual presentation.andP;  Compile yourimages into a PC screenshow and run through the presentation at your desk.andO;Better yet, record your voice as you practice.andP;  Are you talking too quickly?andO;Too slowly?andP;  Try again.andP;
