(computer companies unwilling to take a stand onbuses, platforms, local area networks) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Machrone, Bill.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Vendors in the computer industry are attempting to keep theiroptions open by not committing to any standard offered in theindustry, whether the standard applies to platforms, buses, localarea networks or software.andP;  Such a philosophy is beneficial forthe vendors, because it enables them to change direction quicklyand resist locking into a standard that may begin to decline.andP;  Butthe non-committal stance is just as disruptive to the industry asa whole as it is beneficial to individual vendors.andP;  Lack ofcommitment results in a society where no vendor is willing to takethe lead.andP;  If a company makes a stand, it is inundated withdisagreements from the same people who are unwilling to make theirown commitments.andP;  When PC Magazine chose to support the80386SX-based machines over 80286-based microcomputers because oftheir value, it was wrongfully accused of turning its back on thesmall user.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer industryStandardizationManagementDecision MakingVendor Relations.andO;Feature:   illustrationcartoon.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Bill Machrone Nobody believes in anything anymore.andP;  Agnosticism is runningwild among the hardware and software vendors.andM;Microsoft says, &quot;We're not favoring EISA or Micro Channel.andP;  We're busagnostics.&quot;andP;  Lotus says, &quot;We'll run 1-2-3 wherever it makes sense.andP;  We'replatform agnostics.&quot;andP;  Various hardware vendors say, &quot;LAN Manager or Novell?andO;It doesn't matter to us.andP;  We're LAN agnostics.&quot;andM;Maybe the turn of phrase is unfortunate, but I call it hedging.andP;  Atheists atleast have the courage of their convictions.andP;  Agnostics hang back, waitingfor some blinding proof.andP;  This dispassionate intellectualism can be carriedto a fault--our industry was founded on advocacy and commitment.andM;Some of the industry agnostics are merely keeping their options open.andP;  Theydon't want to limit their companies' growth by overcommitting to a platformthat may turn out to be in decline.andP;  And they certainly want to catch thewave if a hot new platform explodes onto the market.andM;But the upshot of such agnosticism is user confusion.andP;  It's tough enoughmaking decisions about how to spend the company's money without watching thevendors you're counting on for leadership being wishy-washy.andP;  It's a loteasier to respect the ones who have an opinion and stand by it.andM;Whenever you take a strong stance, people invariably come out of the woodworkto disagree with you.andP;  Which is OK.andP;  You get to test the strength of yourconvictions.andP;  There are, however, those who intentionally misunderstand yourpoint of view, or who take it out of context in order to disagree with it forthe sake of disagreeing.andM;A case in point is PC Magazine's position on 286-based computers.andP;  We saythey're fine, functional machines that will do a lot of useful,cost-effective computing before their time is through.andP;  However, you can buya 386SX for the same money.andP;  We also see a wave of 386-aware software comingdown the pike.andP;  We see economical 486 computers, especially price-effectivefor those who require a math coprocessor.andP;  So while we'll continue to testand review 286 machines, we won't be making Editor's Choices in thatcategory.andP;  In other words, they aren't the kind of machines we'd buy with ourown money.andM;Some of the more passionate voices in the user group community decided tointerpret this as a decision to abandon the little people who got us where weare today.andP;  Maybe we're not talking to the same little people, but the ones Isee are buying 386 machines like hotcakes.andP;  They're upgrading their existingmachines, and generally doing everything they can to avail themselves of thisnew technology and to extend their computing power per dollar as far aspossible.andM;WILLFUL IGNORANCEandM;Some have even chosen to misinterpret massie undertakings like our review of109 386 machines earlier this year.andP;  Syndicated computer columnist and WhiteHouse correspondent Brit Hume claims that PC Magazine has turned its back onthe 13 million XT and AT users out there.andP;  He sez that we sez that everybodyshould have a 386 system.andP;  He also claims that our enthusiasm for OS/2 isjust another contribution to the hype surrounding the product.andP;  Hume wants toknow why PC Magazine is such a willing partner in beating the drum forhardware and software that nobody ostensibly needs or wants.andM;I'll tell you why.andP;  When the guys from ALR come by to show us a 486 systemfor $4,500, I get excited.andP;  When Zeos, Northgate, CompuAdd, and others ship80386SX machines for the same price as 286 machines, I sit up and takenotice.andP;  And when Northgate ships a full 32-bit 386 for the same price, I'mfloored.andM;Similarly, PageMaker for Presentation Manager crystallizes everything we'vebeen saying about multitasking for the last two years.andP;  It's at least twiceas fast on equivalent hardware.andP;  That's real productivity for the desktoppublisher.andM;Manufacturers tell me that they keep 286 machines in their lines only becauseof managers who can't reconcile themselves to buying 386 boxes for theirsecretaries, no matter how inexpensive the machines are.andP;  I want to go outand discuss their purchases with each and every one of these people.andP;  I wantthem to get the most computer for their money.andP;  I dont't want them to besorry a year from now.andP;  But I can't do that.andP;  So I do the next best thing--Iedit this magazine.andM;Hume dismisses my observations about hyperchange as hyperhype.andP;  Perhaps hehasn't talked to the boggled, beleaguered micro managers who ask me if wecouldn't hold off the next round of technological advances until they've hada chance to absorb the last one.andP;  As if PC Magazine had the power to holdback the tide.andP;  As if not reporting about change can prevent it fromhappening.andM;WE NEED COMMITMENTandM;Micro managers would be considerably relieved if some of the major playerswould drop their agnostic postures and make some clearer statemetns aboutdirection, performance, and integration.andP;  It's no accident that IBM decidedyears ago that it needed a heftier operating system than DOS to meet itssystem integration goals.andP;  It's no accident that Compaq has committed tofully supporting LAN Manager.andP;  Its customer know that system integration bythe manufacturer is a cure for the pains of trial and error and may be theonly way to guarantee system-level performance.andP;  This won't stop thousands ofVARs and system integrators from using NetWare, nor should it.andP;  They'rebelievers, and belief generates commitment.andM;There's no agnosticism here at PC Magazine.andP;  Believe it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
