In recent years, hundreds of thousands of closely heldcorporations have converted to S status for the benefits ofbeing taxed at the owners' level, much as partnerships are.Conversion isn't taxable. But a staffer of Congress's jointtax committee on Friday disclosed an unexpected proposal tochange that. The plan would create a &quot;toll charge&quot; that&quot;would practically eliminate conversions,&quot; says Richard Shawof Shenas, Shaw andamp; Spievak, a San Diego law firm.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal is in recent joint-committee-staffrecommendations to the House Ways and Means panel forsimplifying taxes; it came out at a meeting of American BarAssociation tax lawyers in Washington. It would treat aconversion as a liquidation of the corporation and adistribution of assets. Thus, corporate tax would be imposedon the concern's accumulated gain in value; then the ownerswould owe personal tax on the remaining balance. Theeffective total tax rate could be 52.5%.   This treatment, rejected by legislators in 1982 and 1986,eliminates many other S-corporation tax complexities, Shawsays, &quot;but at too high a cost.&quot;                                                                                                          PEACE AND COMFORT may return to the IRS's private-rulingpolicy.   The IRS provoked protests a year ago by saying it wouldstop issuing requested &quot;comfort&quot; rulings to confirm obviouseffects of proposed transactions; it saw no need to rule onissues &quot;clearly and adequately addressed by publishedauthority&quot; and hoped to ease strains on its resources. Butresponding to the outcries, it sought comments and delayedthe sweeping policy change to this week. Now Announcement90-65 says the IRS has dropped the plan and will adopt somesuggested alternatives.   The measures will include providing a list of specificno-ruling topics, model language for certain documents,checklists of &quot;safe-harbor&quot; tests for some transactions, andprocedures for automatic rulings on certain issues. The IRSsays it will discuss each measure with tax-professionalgroups before issuing specific guidelines.                                                                                                          BANKRUPTCIES are demanding 23% of Justice Department taxlawyers' time.   Uncle Sam is a major creditor in many cases. The job ofprotecting IRS tax claims is surging along withbankruptcy-court filings, Assistant Attorney General Petersonsays. Justice's tax division got almost 12,000 new cases infiscal 1989 and expects almost 16,000 in 1990-up from 5,000in 1986. The worst may be yet to come, she says, perhapsarising from leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s. &quot;LBO has insome minds come to stand for `large bankruptcy opportunity,'&quot;she told the ABA tax lawyers last week.   Peterson says the government intends to play &quot;anaggressive role&quot; in bankruptcy cases and in large cases willseek a place on committees that speak for creditors. So far,that has happened only in the cases of Texans William HerbertHunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt, where it was very productive.The government expects to receive about $170 million in thosecases and could get an additional $165 million, depending onthe Hunts' future income.   Bankruptcy-court statisticians expect 735,000 filings infiscal 1990, up from 658,000 in 1989, and are projectingroughly 10% rises in 1991 and 1992.                                                                                                          SOCIAL SECURITY numbers for dependents as young as twomust be listed on 1989 returns so that the IRS can checkdependency claims. It is sending notices to filers who didn'tsupply the numbers or insert the words &quot;applied for&quot; onreturns. Filers who omitted a number for the second year willget a stronger notice and may be assessed a new $50 penalty.                                                                                                          A $25,000 PENALTY, the new maximum, has been levied onCharles W. Singer Jr. of Philadelphia for persisting infrivolous and delaying tactics in Tax Court. Judge Cohen alsoupheld civil fraud penalties. Singer previously pleadedguilty in a district court of criminal tax evasion.                                                                                                          ALLEGED IRS MISCONDUCT and the agency's plans to deal withit are to be discussed today at a hearing before a HouseGovernment Operations panel headed by Rep. Barnard (D., Ga.).IRS Commissioner Goldberg and Treasury Inspector GeneralKirkendall are scheduled to testify.                                                                                                          MINIMUM-TAX RULES affect June payments of corporateestimated taxes.   Starting this year, corporations must calculate an amountcalled adjusted current earnings in determining whether theyowe the 20% alternative minimum tax instead of regular tax ata lower effective rate. Last week, the IRS proposed rules forcomputing the amount. Calendar-year corporations should usethe rules in calculating estimated taxes due June 15, SamuelStarr of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, CPAs, recommends. On the whole,the rules seem reasonable, he says.   Banks, life-insurance concerns, and corporations that arepartners in partnerships in particular are affected byseveral provisions. And a section related to employeestock-ownership plans will hit many companies, Starr says: Ineffect, it denies for minimum-tax purposes a full deductionfor dividends paid to an ESOP. Such deductions are allowed incalculating regular taxes, on certain conditions.   The IRS has scheduled a hearing on the proposed rules onOct. 16 and 17.
