A connector is fixed to the end of theflight bar; the inner part of the link is received within a recess inthe bottom edge of the connector whilst the outer part of the link restson a tongue forming the outer end of the connector. The tongue is longenough to ensure that it lies in contact with the bottom of the outerpart throughout the maximum possible lateral movement of the connectorrelative to the link. To limit that movement the inner part of the linkmay be a close fit in the recess and the connector itself may be a closefit between the two parts. In a modification, the tongue may be one prongof a fork in which the outer part fits closely.</TEXT></DOC>
