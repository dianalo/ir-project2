<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0698 </DOCNO><TEXT>Indian Space Research Organization has planned a series of satellitesof the 150 Kg class during eighties for various scientific missions.The mission demands are such that both spinning, as well as 3-axis establishedsatellites are required. A single bus satellite design scattering toboth the type of mission requirements has been evolved. This particularrequirement has imposed severe constraints on the solar array design.The various options considered and the final choice made is presented.The first of the series, namely SROSS-1 is ready for launch. The fabricationmethodology followed for the SROSS-1 solar array is also discussed. Theindigenously developed solar cells from Bharat Electronics Ltd., Indiahave been used for SROSS-1. The qualification plan followed and the CICtechnology developed for these cells are also briefly presented.</TEXT></DOC>
