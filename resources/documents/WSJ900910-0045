Some collection agencies are using personal computers tosearch huge national databases of names and addresses such asone owned by Metromail, a Lombard, Ill., unit of R.R.Donnelley andamp; Sons. Others buy compact disks containing monthlyupdates of phone directories from regional phone companies.   One of the newest systems is SearchLink from DigitalSystems International, a Redmond, Wash., maker of automateddialing equipment for collection agencies. If a billcollector can't find the debtor at a phone number, or if thephone is disconnected, SearchLink forwards the record toAcolaid, a 104 million-name database owned by ComputerGraphics, Phoenix, Ariz.   The Acolaid database, which includes information fromtelephone directories, driver's license records and thePostal Service's change-of-address files, first crosschecksnames and addresses to see if the information was wrong. Itautomatically fixes phone numbers or ZIP codes that wererecorded incorrectly.   If the information was right, the database can deliver thename and phone number of as many as eight neighbors -- knownin the trade as nearbys. It can also list people with thesame surname in nearby ZIP code areas. They might berelatives who would know where a debtor had skipped to.   Neil Hanley, vice president of operations for JDRRecovery, a Ramsey, N.J., collection agency, says he's usingthe system to determine &quot;how many nearbys it's necessary tocall -- is the guy across the street better to call than theguy next door?&quot;                                                                                                          Wireless PC Networks   Get a Jolt From NCR                                                                                                          THE HIGH-TECH goal of tying computers together in networksoften founders on the low-tech problem of putting in wires,which can cost $500 to $1,000 a PC in older buildings.   A few firms have introduced wireless radio and infrarednetworks to solve the problem, but they've been slow andexpensive.   Today, NCR will unveil a wireless local area network, orLAN, using radio waves that send data at two million bits asecond, one-fifth the rate of wire networks, but nine timesas fast as previous wireless LANs. NCR's product, WaveLAN,costs $1,390, more than twice as much as network cards thatlet computers connect to wires, but users avoid cabling.   Cees Links, WaveLAN product manager at NCR, Dayton, Ohio,says the system will be marketed initially to companies thatfrequently move PCs around. He says retailers who addpoint-of-sale terminals for holiday sales are interested inbuying systems.   Bankers also are showing interest in WaveLAN for oldbranches, in part because a bank's own computer experts caninstall a wireless LAN, while cabling requires outsidecontractors. &quot;Banks don't want anyone but their own people toinstall networks, because they're so security-conscious,&quot;says Mr. Links.                                                                                                          Hard Disks at the Office   Aren't Private Anymore                                                                                                          PCS on networks are likely to become less personal.   XTree, a San Luis Obispo, Calif., software company,recently introduced a software program that lets networkadministrators read files stored on hard disks in users'computers.   Michael Chuises, XTree's product manager, says the mainpurpose of the feature is to make it easy for a networkmanager to make sure that hundreds of PC users are all usingthe same version of WordPerfect or to check whether users aremaking regular backups of their disks.   Nevertheless, Mr. Chuises concedes, &quot;it's controversial.&quot;A manager can search files on the hard disk even while theuser is working, he says. &quot;It's as if someone was rummagingthrough your desk drawers while you were working on the desktop.&quot;   Many PC users treat their hard disks as private storageareas. But with managers capable of snooping around, usersmay think twice about storing resumes or Internal RevenueService correspondence on company PCs.   Mary Modahl, who studies networks for Forrester Research,a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, says that with the XTreeproduct, &quot;Basically, privacy goes out the window. But ifyou're a large company and you're paying for the computers,how much privacy do you want them to have?&quot;                                                                                                          Translating 1,000 Words   Into a Simple Diagram                                                                                                          ALLCLEAR, a new program from Clear Software Inc.,Brookline, Mass., can turn 1,000 words into a picture.   The $300 program, billed as an &quot;automatic ideaillustrator,&quot; has excited industry gurus. Its creator,Russian emigre Vadim Yasinovsky, &quot;has both a hot product anda metaphor that will become an important contribution tosoftware design,&quot; says Jeff Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter,a Watertown, Mass., newsletter.   Using AllClear, a person can type a list of instructionsor a description of an organization, and AllClear willautomatically turn it into a chart with boxes and arrowsshowing connections and relationships. Among 100 examplesdiagrammed in AllClear's manual are procedures forprogramming a videocassette recorder, diagnosing a car anddetermining insurance coverage for a patient.   There are already a variety of software programs that helpdraw charts. But AllClear does it automatically with a simpleeightword language that shows how one item is related to thenext. For instance, a statement followed by a question markcreates a diagram with two branches, one for &quot;yes,&quot; one for&quot;no.&quot; A statement followed by a colon allows a number ofdifferent paths.</TEXT></DOC>
