With regard to otherdisease types either the contribution of soil-induced stress is unclearor the 'new type' character of the disease is in question. Several fieldinventories and some experiments give evidence that a high input of protons,sulfate and nitrate may decrease the pH value of certain soil types incertain landscapes, enhance the leaching of Ca, Mg and K from the soilsand may also release Al and heavy metals into the soil solution. Thesynchronization of different disease types during the period 1980-1985on the contrary is caused by large-scale weather stress events like dryperiods or frost phenomena or combinations of such events. Infertilesoils, inadequate nutrition, pollution and atmospheric deposition orpathogens are not general, but regional or disease-type specific stressfactors, whereever they act with large intensity.</TEXT></DOC>
