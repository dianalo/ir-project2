That, indeed, is how the Soviets read the treaty for years, until they saw that emerging technologies might allow the U.S. to build an effective defense.&quot;    A &quot;broad interpretation&quot; of the ABM Treaty was issued by Judge Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser. In your editorial, such a view of the treaty's meaning is ascribed to the Soviets &quot;for years,&quot; up until recently.    I served for four of those years (1976-1981) as U.S. Commissioner on the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Standing Consultative Commission. In dealing with many items of practical application of ABM Treaty provisions and the negotiating record, I never heard anything from the Soviet side, formally or informally, directly or indirectly, that resembled or might be attributed to the sort of views that Judge Sofaer brings into his &quot;broad interpretation&quot; as a departure from the &quot;narrow interpretation&quot; accepted by all interested parties &quot;for years.&quot;    Ambassador Robert W. Buchheim   Phoenix, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
