EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, in remarks to reportersThursday, named only four major regulations he would try tocomplete before leaving office in January.   Thomas said he also would try to nail down arrangements for aninternational conference in the next administration to strengthen atreaty limiting chlorofluorocarbon emissions.   ``I'm trying to make decisions that are logical and natural, notspeeding it up or slowing it down,'' Thomas said.   The four major regulations he said he would press for are:   _New controls on gasoline volatility.   _Requiring larger gasoline vapor recovery systems on cars.   _Eventually banning the manufacture or import of asbestos andasbestos products.   _Revising the major regulation governing the ``Superfund'' toxicwaste cleanup program.   Thomas said he was hoping to see the approval of several piecesof legislation, including a revision of the Clean Air Act settingnew deadlines for cities to comply with federal clean air standards.   He also held out hope for these other legislative actions:   _A revision of federal pesticide laws setting deadlines for theagency to review old chemicals and abolishing the requirement thatthe agency pay for inventories of banned products   _A bill providing $10 million to aid state programs dealing withradon pollution in the home.   _A bill clarifying the agency's authority over medical waste.   ``These are the natural kinds of things for me to complete,''Thomas said.   In 1981, the incoming Reagan administration accused DouglasCostle, EPA administrator for President Carter, as well as heads ofother agencies of hastily putting out regulations and making otherdecisions to pre-empt what the new administration could do.Reagan's appointees revoked several of those actions.   ``We're not going to wield the signature machine all night longon Jan. 19,'' Thomas said.</TEXT></DOC>
