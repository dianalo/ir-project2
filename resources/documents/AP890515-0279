By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a 1953 high courtdecision that permitted lawsuits under an anti-fraud provision ofthe Securities Act of 1933. The reversal was one of under 200 inthe court's history.   The case stemmed from a challenge by 17 first-time investors tostandard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle alldisputes. The ruling affirmed a decision by the 5th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals, which reversed a ruling by a lower federal courtin Bronwsville, Texas.   The investors, some of whom could not understand English,included minors, widows and people dying of cancer.   The case was widely watched by the securities industry, whichhistorically has supported arbitration in client-broker disputes,arguing that this process saves brokerage firms enormous legalcosts.   William Fitzpatrick, general counsel for the SIA: ``We are verypleased with the ruling,'' said William Fitzpatrick general counselfor the Securities Industry Association, an organization ofbrokerages. ``This should go a long way toward avoiding confusionby making all arbitration contracts enforcable as written, and itshould reduce a tremendous amount of expensive unnecessary andtime-consuming litigation.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said the 1953Supreme Court decision ``has fallen far out of step with ourcurrent strong endorsement'' of federal laws that favor arbitration.   ``Our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort tothe arbitration process does not inherently undermine any of thesubstantive rights afforded (investors) under the Securities Act,''he said.   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, accused thecourt of unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will ofCongress.   ``Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashionpublic policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of usewho are inclined to give wide latitutde to the views of the voters'representatives on non-constitutional matters,'' he said.   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.Dissenting with Stevens were Justices William J. Brennan, ThurgoodMarshall and Harry A. Blackmun.   The investors opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 withthe predecessor of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Brownsville,doing business with account manager Jon Grady Deaton.   The investors claimed Deaton mismanaged separate accountstotaling some $190,000, and conducted unauthorized transactions togenerate commissions and profits.   Shearson, now owned by American Express, went to federal courtto enforce the arbitration agreements in the contracts. But thelower court cited the Supreme Court's 1953 decision againstarbitration that permitted a court suit.   The company then appealed, citing a 1987 high court ruling thatsaid claims against brokers made under the federal SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 should be arbitrated.   In other business-related action, the court Monday:   _Ruled that civil fines on top of criminal penalties may be aform of unconstitutional double jeopardy. The ruling came in thecase of a New York City medical laboratory manager hit with$131,170 in civil fines for defrauding the federal government of$585 on Medicare bills.   _Agreed to resolve a dispute stemming from the federalgovernment's efforts to protect American workers from hazardouschemicals. The court said it will hear the Bush administration'sargument that a federal appeals court wrongly required thatadditional information be supplied to employees.   _Rejected a Bush administration appeal aimed at giving thegovernment more power to control rents for federally subsidizedhousing. Without comment, the court refused to review a decisionfavoring landlords in Washington state.   _Let stand a ruling that New York hotel owner Leona Helmsleycannot appeal a trial judge's denial of a special hearing in herprosecution on charges of federal income tax evasion.</TEXT></DOC>
