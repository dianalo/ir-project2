Michaels told a House Energyand Commerce subcommittee studying the global warming problem.   Dr. Stephen Schneider, a scientist for the National Center forAtmospheric Research, agreed that better information is needed, buthe said action was needed now as ``insurance against catastrophicchange.''   The greenhouse effect ``gives you an additional reason'' to redceburning of fossil fuels and take other action to benefit theenvironment, the Boulder, Colo., climate specialist said.   The subcommittee was told that it may take two decades to learnwhether the greenhouse effect is responsible for temperature changeslike the searing heat waves of last summer.   Schneider and Michaels agreed that scientists are unable toattribute last summer's heat to the buildup of greenhouses gases,and Schneider showed the committee slides of news articles that hesaid prematurely blamed last summer's temperatures on the buildingup greenhouse gases.   Schneider said ``another decade, or possibly two, will berequired to be sure that the warming of the 1980s (the warmestdecade recorded on a global basis) will ... continue into the 1990sand beyond.''   ``I expect it will, but I can't prove it, of course,'' he said.   Michaels, a professor of environmental sciences, said climateexperts have a ``clouded vision'' of future global warming, and toldlawmakers that ``basing sweeping environmental policy'' on suchuncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy is otherwiserational.''   Michaels has warned in past statements against ``publichysteria'' and ``the politics of fear'' toward global warming.   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's atmospheretrap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, themore heat.   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than theyare to outgoing infrared energy. Mars, a planet with a thin,predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a mean temperature thatis below that of deep freezers. Venus, with a thick, largely carbondioxide atmosphere, is hotter than an oven.   The earth's atmosphere, on the other hand, has been just right tosupport life. It has not become an iceball because of heat trappedby greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, fluorocarbons, nitrousoxide.   In addition to natural buildup, the greenhouse gases haveincreased dramatically because of human activities, includingburning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas; and destruction oftropical rain forests.   The problem comes in trying to predict the future.   Michaels denied that he's trying to ``throw roadblocks in the wayof sensible environmental policy,'' and agreed global climaticchange is ``potentially the most serious environmental disturbanceever created by technological man.''   But he added, ``My purpose is rather to underscore that policyshould be commensurate with the state of scientific knowledge.''   Although there's no single set of figures to show how much theerth has warmed, Michaels said the planet ``at best, appears to havewarmed up only half as much as our average forecasts indicate itshould have.''   He added that the greenhouse effect may be causing a rise innighttime temperatures only, a potentially beneficial effect thatcould lengthen growing seasons. And it is ``well known,'' he added,``that long-term climate records sometimes warm because theirsurroundings become more urbanized.''   Schneider, in proposing action now, suggested stepped-upinvestments in efficient energy production; accelerated testing ofnon-fossil fuel alternatives; development of climate-adapted cropstrains; coastal planning to deal with rising sea levels and stormsurges.   ``Delaying rapid change can buy us time to adapt more easily andprovide insurance against the not remote possibility of catastrophicrates of change,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
