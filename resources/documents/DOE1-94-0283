The companies are: Southern California Edison Company(Edison), an electric utility; Kinetics Technology International Corporation(KTI), a worldwide engineering contractor; and International Fuel CellsCorporation (IFC), a leading fuel cell manufacturer. The FCPP was installedat the Industry Hills Exhibit-Conference Center and operated on a landfillgas feedstock which was upgraded to natural gas specifications. The gaswas upgraded by using activated carbon for trace contaminates removaland a membrane system for CO{sub 2} removal. The Industry Hills FCPPoperated over 5500 hours proving the technical viability of using processedlandfill gas. Although the technical feasibility of FCPP operation onupgraded landfill gas was confirmed, internal studies indicated thatthe economic viability of fuel cells could be enhanced by using landfillgas without the costly equipment necessary to upgrade the fuel to naturalgas specifications. In order to explore the feasibility of direct biogasutilization in FCPP's, KTI was contracted by Edison to analyze the performanceand identify any potential problems of operating the 40 kW PC18 FCPPon untreated landfill gas, i.e., without CO{sub 2} removal. KTI developedfor Edison an analytical model which considered both process and instrumentrelated capacity limitations. KTI concluded in that assessment that withappropriate control modifications, the PC18 was capable of achieving50-75% of the rated capacity. In the following subsections, each of theprogram participants present their own unique perspective on the subjectof biogas utilization in FCPP.</TEXT></DOC>
