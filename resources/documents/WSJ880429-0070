As previously reported, Central Capital earlier this month increased its stake in U.S. Trust, a New York City bank, to 9.8% from 7.8%. Central Capital is a financial-services concern based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.    &quot;We have no particular target in terms of a percentage but we want the flexibility to add to the investment if we choose,&quot; Thomas Hodgson, Central Capital's senior executive vice president, said after the annual meeting. Mr. Hodgson said he anticipates no problems in getting clearance, which he expects will take a few weeks.    Mr. Hodgson repeated Central Capital's earlier assertions that the investment in U.S. Trust is &quot;only an investment&quot; and &quot;totally passive.&quot;    Officials at U.S. Trust couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Peter Cole, Central Capital's president and chief executive officer, said he expects 1988 profit to be &quot;at or near&quot; 1987's net income of 90.3 million Canadian dollars ($73.5 million), or 1.40 dollars a share, on revenue of 1.04 billion dollars.
