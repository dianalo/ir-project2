The carrier's stock price has subsided, and so has a recent flurry of takeover speculation after which American Airlines' parent AMR declared itself uninterested in buying Pan Am.    With only an estimated $150 million of cash left in the till, Pan Am appears to have just one more summer tourist season to prove it can be profitable.    &quot;If they don't have a good summer, they're in trouble,&quot; Betsy Snyder, airline analyst at Merrill Lynch, says. &quot;It's kind of sad when you think about the Pan Am name and what's happened to it.&quot;    Few analysts recommend the stock. In fact, short sellers led by the Feshbach brothers in Menlo Park, Calif., are betting it will decline further. Pan Am has $830 million in debt, a $440 million pension liability and a dwindling cash position. It also has had problems raising money, as several proposed debt offerings haven't yet come through.    The company had a 1986 loss of a whopping $462.8 million, as a terrorist hijacking, the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the Soviet Union and the falling dollar all discouraged overseas travel by Americans. Pan Am spent $95 million last year on a loss-making Boston-New York-Washington shuttle. And its biggest transatlantic competitor, TWA, has won a lower cost structure under Carl Icahn.    In an interview in his office yesterday, Pan Am's chairman, Edward Acker, said he isn't considering liquidation. He stuck to his projection that the company will have a profit for the year.    To do that, Mr. Acker says Pan Am expects a 20% increase in tourist-season transatlantic traffic, a bigger gain than the 15% predicted for that market by analysts such as Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers. Mr. Acker thinks Pan Am's gain will be bigger because it was hit harder than non-U.S. carriers by last year's scares.    The company had to scrap about $225 million of high-yield bond issues at year's end after a few unfavorable analysts' reports. Although Pan Am has arranged a $150 million credit facility with Citicorp, it hasn't actually obtained the funds. Mr. Acker said it was &quot;a coincidence&quot; that Pan Am turned to Citicorp, whose former chairman, Walter Wriston, is on Pan Am's board.    Pan Am's own bonds have recently traded at yields of 17.5%, according to one brokerage report, indicating that investors consider them highly risky. Other bonds of the same maturity and credit rating have been yielding about 13%.    One wild card is the prospective change of control at Resorts International, which owns 9.2% of Pan Am's stock, a stake currently valued at about $57 million. Donald Trump has agreed to buy all Resorts Class B shares for $101 million but apparently hasn't decided what he would do with the Pan Am stake.    Richard Bilotti, a bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, says Pan Am's asset values total about $2 billion -- including a $1 billion fleet and gates and routes valued at a total of $800 million. He puts total liabilities at $1.5 billion, giving the stock an indicated value in a liquidation of just $3.75 a share.    Mr. Maldutis of Salomon Brothers cautions that a liquidation analysis may be misleading because asset prices fluctuate greatly. In addition, few airlines have been liquidated in the past decade, with one obstacle being high severance costs.    Although Pan Am sold its Pacific routes for $750 million, analysts value its Atlantic routes at less, and their value is eroding steadily as new departure rights are awarded to other carriers. Mr. Acker, however, said the growth of the overall market offsets that.    Despite Pan Am's losses, Mr. Acker hadn't taken a cut in his $500,000 annual pay until this year, when he volunteered for a 20% cut, along with one other top executive, as part of a plan to save $280 million in annual costs. Nearly two-thirds of the cut must be won by negotiation from union workers, as Mr. Acker pointed out: &quot;You can't just wave a magic wand and cut labor costs. You have to do it on a negotiated basis. You have to do it as a confrontation.&quot;    Mr. Acker said he finds that distasteful and doesn't aspire to union-bashing. &quot;I don't like to go bashing people's brains out,&quot; he said.    He noted that Pan Am's circumstances differ from those at Texas Air's Continental Airlines and at TWA, where Frank Lorenzo and Mr. Icahn won big cost savings from unions.    &quot;Look, it would be wonderful if we had some of those negotiating opportunities,&quot; he said, &quot;but we don't have them, and we can't manufacture them ourselves.&quot;    ---   Pan AM   (NYSE: Symbol: PN)   Business: Airline   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Loss: $197.5 vs. net income:   $241.4 million, or $1.79 a share*    Average daily trading volume:   591,389 shares (February)   Common shares outstanding: 136.4 million    *1985 profit includes gain of $341 million on sale of a division </TEXT></DOC>
