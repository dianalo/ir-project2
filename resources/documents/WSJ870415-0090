The three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel here, in a case involving General Dynamics Corp., said that &quot;in the circumstances of this case, an employer's compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards will not discharge his statutory obligation to provide employees with safeguards against recognized hazards.&quot;    The decision seems to suggest that employees &quot;will fall under a larger canopy of protection simply because the court has ordered that employers must respond effectively to a well-known hazard in their industry,&quot; an OSHA spokesman said.    The case concerned OSHA citations in 1983 against General Dynamics's Land Systems division for the alleged overexposure of a worker to toxic chemicals at a Michigan plant.    The company appealed, and the job-safety agency's review commission subsequently ruled that since the company complied with specific safety standards, it didn't violate the general statutory duty to assure workplace safety. But the United Auto Workers union and the Labor Department asked the court to throw out the board's order, arguing that a specific standard doesn't preempt enforcement of the statute.    The decision, written by Judge James Buckley, concluded that OSHA isn't empowered &quot;to absolve employers who observe specific standards from duties otherwise imposed on them by a general duty clause.&quot; The court vacated the review commission's order and sent the case back to the commission.    The UAW called it &quot;a very important decision.&quot;    &quot;There aren't specific standards for everything, and many OSHA standards are outmoded in any case, so the general duty clause as Congress recognized is very important for filling in protection,&quot; said Franklin Mirer, the union's health and safety director.    A spokesman for General Dynamics said the company hadn't seen the ruling and didn't have any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
