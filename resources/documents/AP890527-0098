The monthlong strike at Tavern on the Green may not rival theEastern Airlines strike in size or impact on the public, but thetwo sides in the restaurant battle yield to no one in rhetoric orpassion.   Each side accuses the other of lying. In the advertisement,manager Warner LeRoy calls the restaurant's workers ``among thehighest paid in the restaurant world.''   ``They are not even the highest-paid in a square mile of hisrestaurant,'' snaps back John Turchiano, a spokesman for Local 6 ofthe Hotel-Motel Trades Council.   But while business is down _ and LeRoy admits losing millions ofdollars _ business lunchers and out-of-towners continue to come forthe clubby atmosphere, creme brulee, red snapper and Sunday brunch.   ``Best reception I ever got,'' joked one business-suited manFriday after passing through the ``shame on you'' chants.   ``It's very annoying, them yelling at you,'' said Mary Wielandof Lancaster, Pa., who was lunching with friends. But, she added,``I wanted to eat at Tavern on the Green.''   Management claims Tavern on the Green's workers are among thebest-paid in the business, with a base pay of $18,830 fordishwashers, the lowest-paid workers at the restaurant. Waitersmake $2.60 an hour plus tips, bringing their total wages to $39,000to $45,000 a year, management says.   Turchiano disputes those figures, saying dishwashers who workfive-day, 40-hour weeks make $8,320 a year and that while somewaiters make $40,000 annually, most earn between $17,000 and$19,000 a year.   The union has rejected a 21.4 percent increase, saying workersneed 40 percent _ more for dishwashers _ to rise to the level ofworkers at comparable restaurants.   The two sides also disagree about heath care benefits and workconditions.   The union has been trying to negotiate a contract with LeRoysince January and mounted an informational picket line on April 23.   The strike began April 30, when LeRoy fired workers en masse forholding a meeting on restaurant premises.   Details of the incident are murky. Management says there was apartial walkout by 11 employees; the union says 200 workers calledan impromptu meeting.   In any event, some workers walked out and were barred fromreturning. Most of the rest refused to work and were fired.   The restaurant management has since hired replacement workers,and claims to have a full complement of 430 workers. The union says275 of its members are on strike and 10 have remained on the job.   Turchiano accused LeRoy of ``spending a fortune to keep theworkers from getting a decent contract.''   LeRoy said he plans to fight even more fiercely. He said he willfile a lawsuit Wednesday alleging libel, slander and interferencewith business.   ``This is a very rough union playing dirty and telling lies,''LeRoy said. ``I'm a good employer and I have good employees. Thisis a crazy situation.''   ``He knows how to entertain,'' shot back Steve Palozzi, astriking waiter, ``but he doesn't know how to take care of hisworkers.''</TEXT></DOC>
