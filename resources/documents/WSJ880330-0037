Birnbaum and David Rogers (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis won a big and desperately needed victory in the Democratic primary in Connecticut.    With nearly all of the vote in, Mr. Dukakis had 58% and the Rev. Jesse Jackson 28%. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore was a distant third with 8% of the vote. Mr. Dukakis won 36 of Connecticut's Democratic delegates, while Mr. Jackson won the remaining 16.    Although the Rev. Jackson didn't realize his hopes of surprising the Massachusetts governor in a close contest, there was some encouraging news for the civil rights activist. According to NBC News exit polls, he got nearly one-fifth of the total white vote in the state, including about one-quarter of the votes cast by white bluecollar workers. He also garnered his usual 90% of the black vote; only about one-tenth of Connecticut's electorate is black.    The results were predictable on the Republican side, as Vice President George Bush clobbered Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, who had dropped out of the race yesterday afternoon. The vice president beat Mr. Dole 70% to 20%, while Pat Robertson finished with about 3%.    Mr. Dukakis's victory in his own New England territory wasn't unexpected, but was a very important win nevertheless. Even a close race with Mr. Jackson would have represented another in a string of setbacks for Mr. Dukakis, including Mr. Jackson's win on Saturday in Michigan. Moreover, the decisive Connecticut victory restores some momentum to his lately lackluster campaign.    What's more, the victory narrowly restores Mr. Dukakis's lead in the neck-and-neck race for delegates. Dukakis aides believe it is psychologically important to remain ahead of Mr. Jackson in delegates throughout the marathon of state contests remaining before the Democratic convention in July.    Mr. Dukakis's success yesterday comes as the candidate faces some very tough races. Polls show him in an almost dead-even race in Wisconsin with Mr. Jackson, and politicians there say Mr. Jackson has the momentum for the April 5 primary.    Two weeks later, 255 delegates will be at stake in the New York primary. Mr. Jackson has a strong base of support in New York as well, and Sen. Gore is challenging Mr. Dukakis there for white support, especially the big bloc of Jewish voters.    Courting those voters, Mr. Gore yesterday attacked Gov. Dukakis for endorsing a letter signed by senators criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's resistance to Secretary of State George Shultz's Mideast peace initiative.    Also with an eye to appealing to Jewish voters, Sen. Gore mounted a rare attack on Mr. Jackson yesterday. &quot;I categorically reject his notion that there's a moral equivalence between Israel and the PLO,&quot; Mr. Gore said. &quot;We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president.&quot;    Referring to the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization and of Cuba, Mr. Gore added, &quot;I am dismayed by his embrace of (Yasir) Arafat and (Fidel) Castro.&quot;    Mr. Jackson has long called for an independent Palestinian state, but lately hasn't talked directly about the PLO. He is also careful to add the demand that the U.S. continue to guarantee the security of Israel. Mr. Gore's remark about Mr. Castro and Mr. Arafat refers to Mr. Jackson's celebrated meetings with the two men.    Mr. Gore's showing in Connecticut was another in a line of dismal performances since his impressive showing in the South three weeks ago. Unless he begins to do considerably better soon, he runs the risk of losing federal matching funds.    Mr. Dukakis came to Connecticut with many advantages. He was supported by the state's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Christopher Dodd. He also is governor of a neighboring state whose citizenry is similar in many respects.    Despite Mr. Dukakis's victory, the exit polls indicated that his support in Connecticut wasn't very enthusiastic. According to the poll, 46% of Dukakis voters wish someone else were in the race, while only 41% of his voters were pleased with the choice of candidates in the field. Still, Mr. Dukakis did better than expected with white blue-collar voters, attracting two-thirds of their votes.    By contrast, a strong majority of Mr. Jackson's supporters were pleased with the field. His white support was coming especially from very liberal, highly educated, 35-year-olds to 49-year-olds. Two-thirds of Mr. Jackson's white supporters called themselves liberal, and 40% of his white voters have a post-graduate education.    Nearly half of all Connecticut Democrats polled said they wished that someone else was running; only 38% of the whites who voted yesterday were pleased with the selection.    ---   Rich Jaroslovsky contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
