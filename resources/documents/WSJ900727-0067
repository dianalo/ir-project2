The criminal fine is the second-largest ever against adefense contractor and the largest against a company accusedof fraudulent pricing. Earlier this year, Los Angeles-basedNorthrop Corp. was fined $17 million after pleading guilty to34 counts of making false statements to the governmentinvolving the company's testing of weapons parts.</LP><TEXT>   The penalty against GE was announced yesterday in afederal district court in Philadelphia, where the company andtwo suspended employees were convicted of fraud and relatedcharges last February following a 14-week trial. The twosuspended employees were fined and both received prisonsentences yesterday.   The trial concerned a 1983 GE contract with the U.S. Armyand GE's aerospace unit, Management andamp; Technical Services Co.,or MATSCO, to produce a mobile battlefield computer system.   Prosecutors alleged that the Fairfield, Conn., concern,the nation's third-largest defense contractor, misrepresentedsubcontracting costs and concealed millions of dollars incost reductions from government auditors between 1983 and1985.   GE was convicted of four counts of mail fraud and 282counts of filing false claims. Gerald A. Leo, a formerpurchasing manager, was convicted of four counts of mailfraud and one count of submitting false documents to agovernment auditor. James Badolato, a former subcontractsmanager, was convicted of one count of obstruction of justicefor trying to cover up the fraud.   Mr. Leo was sentenced yesterday to 10 months in prison andwas fined $15,000. Mr. Badolato received five months inprison and was fined $10,000. Both remain free pending theirappeals.   In addition to paying the $10 million criminal fine, GEagreed to settle several pending federal civil suits relatedto the case for $8.3 million and to pay an additional $11.7million in connection with several unrelated defensecontracting matters pending in eastern Pennsylvania.Prosecutors said the latter also involved improper billings,some of which GE voluntarily disclosed.   Prosecutors and the company said in a joint sentencingrecommendation to federal Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr., whopresided over the trial, that GE &quot;has taken substantialmeasures&quot; since 1985 to ensure ethical conduct in all defensecontracting.   Nevertheless, prosecutors said that the trial of Messrs.Leo and Badolato produced evidence of complicity by others atthe company, though not enough to bring additional criminalcharges. &quot;Individuals above Leo and Badolato turned a blindeye and adopted a look-the-other-way mentality,&quot; saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas C. Harbist, who helpedprosecute the case.   In handing down his sentence against GE, Judge Reed calledthe company's behavior &quot;reprehensible&quot; and said the fine wasa sad commentary on GE's &quot;corporate character.&quot; GE's MATSCOunit, in King of Prussia, Pa., was suspended from defensecontracting for two months in 1989.   As part of GE's settlement of the cases, the companyagreed to forgo all appeals.   ---   REINSURERS win important victory in federal appeals court.   In a typical reinsurance arrangement, insurers give up aportion of the premiums they collect on a policy to areinsurance company, which promises to take a portion of anylosses.   The issue in this case, in the Seventh U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in Chicago, involved what actions the reinsurercan take if an insurance company with which it is workingbecomes insolvent.   State statutes governing the liquidation of insolventinsurers generally allow the reinsurer to withhold its losspayments to the insurance company to offset debts theinsolvent company owes it. This leaves the insolvent insurerwith less money for its liquidation.   But insurance company liquidators have long argued thatmoney owed to an insolvent insurer by reinsurance firms can'tbe offset by obligations or debts the insolvent firm mighthave with its reinsurers.   In the decision earlier this week, the federal appealscourt sided with the reinsurer and allowed the offset.   A small amount of money is involved in the Illinois case,which stemmed from the liquidation of Reserve Insurance Co.,declared insolvent in 1979. But there are millions of dollarsat stake in court battles over the same issue involving someof the largest insolvencies in insurance industry history,most notably the liquidation of Mission Insurance Co. inCalifornia. Regulators are trying to recover $300 millionfrom Mission's reinsurers.   If courts generally side with the reinsurers as did theSeventh Circuit, the amount of funds available to liquidatorsto settle the claims of insolvent insurers could be reduced.   &quot;Anything that allows more offsets will reduce the amountof money&quot; eventually going to policyholders, said DeborahAnderson, general counsel for Illinois department thathandles the liquidation of insolvent insurers.   The issue of reinsurance offsets with insolvent companiesis a hotly contested one in the insurance industry thesedays. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners atits annual meeting last month adopted a model law that wouldseverely restrict offsets. It's now up to the individualstate legislatures to decide if they want to make theassociation's guidelines part of their state statutes.   The Seventh Circuit is the highest court so far to wrestlewith the thorny issue. The California Supreme Court hasagreed to hear the case stemming from the Mission insolvencythat involves this same offset issue. Reinsurance executivessay the California statutes regarding reinsurance offsets aresimilar to the Illinois regulations.   Ronald A. Jacks, a Chicago attorney who represented thereinsurers in the Illinois case, believes California'shighest court &quot;will have to take into account the decision ofa highly respected court of appeals.&quot;   ---   KENYAN UNREST has forced a change of venue for September'sInternational Bar Association meeting. Instead of meeting inNairobi, the 12,000-member London-based organization willassemble in New York City Sept. 19-23. William Reece SmithJr. of Tampa, Fla., president of the IBA, cited safetyconcerns and the association's disapproval of the recentimprisonment of several Kenyan lawyers as reasons for theswitch. Three of those lawyers were released yesterday.   ---   Michael Siconolfi contributed to this column.</TEXT></DOC>
