In a move aimed at tempering the labor hostility that helped lead to this week's decision by the Allegis board to dismantle the company, Frank A. Olson, the new chairman and chief executive officer, met with officials of the union that represents United's machinists.    The issue of employee ownership looms as a major hurdle in resolving the disarray at the company. Although some United labor groups appear willing to settle for only a small interest in the company, the union that represents United pilots is still seeking control of the carrier.    The pilots union, in fact, over the weekend rejected a last-minute attempt by former Chairman Richard Ferris to head off events that led to the directors' decision and Mr. Ferris's subsequent resignation. Sources close to the company said Mr. Ferris offered the pilots an ownership interest in United, but that the union rejected his proposal as inadequate.    At the meeting between Mr. Olson and representatives of the International Association of Machinists, officials said Mr. Olson held out the possibility of some form of employee ownership of the airline, but left details of such a plan for future discussions. James Hartigan, United's president, also attended the meeting, sources said.    An Allegis spokesman said Mr. Olson plans to hold a similar meeting in the next few days with the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. The chapter's leaders have said they will continue their efforts to purchase the airline and would oppose any management proposal that offers employees less than majority control.    The machinists told the new Allegis chairman that they continue to oppose the pilots' proposal for an employee-controlled company, sources said. The machinists also said they would oppose any plan that caused excessive debt for the airline. The machinists previously proposed a restructuring plan that called for selling the company's non-airline assets and granting employees a 20% to 30% ownership stake.    As reported earlier, Allegis directors on Tuesday decided to yield to outside pressures to dismantle the company and sell its non-airline units, which consist primarily of Hertz Corp. and its Westin and Hilton International hotel chains.    Meanwhile yesterday, another group of United employees, calling itself the Coalition Acting for the Rights of Employees, or CARE, announced it would try to derail any efforts by the pilots union to take over the airline. It was unclear how many employees CARE represents, although a spokesman said the group is attempting to enlist the aid of some 3,500 mostly nonunion employees.    A spokesman for the pilots union said the CARE group poses &quot;a minor threat.&quot;    In another development, ITT Corp. emerged as a possible buyer of some of the Allegis-owned hotels. Sources said New York-based ITT, which owns Sheraton Corp., is interested in acquisitions as large as $500 million. They added, however, that the company may be interested only in hotels in choice locations, such as New York. Allegis's new management announced Tuesday that it is seeking buyers for its Westin and Hilton International hotel chains.    An Allegis spokesman said its management is &quot;assessing different inquiries&quot; it has received from potential buyers of its hotels. The Westin hotels are valued at $1.2 billion and the Hiltons $1 billion, according to an analysis by Wertheim andamp; Co. released Wednesday.    Allegis shares closed yesterday at $92.25, off 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
