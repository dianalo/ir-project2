 We consume too muchand save and invest too little.andP;  We are too generous with our defense dollarsand waste billions of dollars on poorly thought-out entitlement programs.andO;This has left us with intractable budget and trade deficits, which keeps ourinterest rates high.andM;On all these significant economic parameters the Japanese do better, althoughthey too run a substantial budget deficit.andP;  They can afford to, given theirhuge trade surplus.andM;But according to all these speakers the real culprit is the sad state of ourpublic education system, from kindergarten through high school.andP;  Withrelatively few exceptions, most of our public schools graduate youngsters wholack the essential skills to obtain and hold meaningful jobs.andP;  This impairsour chances of catching up with the Japanese.andM;Problems of EducationandM;I take issue with the speakers' dire predictions regarding the economicconsequences stemming from our admittedly substandard education system.andO;Thurow, for example, said in his speech to the Strategic Planning Forum inWashington, D.C., that the 25 percent of our high school graduates who go onto college are as good as Japanese university graduates.andM;Although it may be unforgivable that only one-fourth of our high schoolgraduates qualify for college enrollment, i argue that at that rate weproduce enough university graduates -- about 1 million each year -- to meetthe economy's basic professional personnel needs.andM;Let's face it, overeducating or overtraining young people for careers forwhich there are not enough jobs -- partly because of the benefit ofinformation technology -- in fact may be counterproductive.andP;  No, as I see it,our disadvantaged position vis-a-vis the Japanese is not solely attributableto the shortcomings of our stuttering public education system.andM;The fault lies with our generally disngaged, self-indulgent seniormanagements, who spend as much time planning t he next leveraged buyout orworrying about their pension increases as they do running their worldwidebusinesses.andM;As to microeconomic issues, Akers, Kearns and Thurow use informationtechnology as another example of how the Japanese first target and thenconquer a strategic industry.andP;  It happened with consumer electronics,semiconductors and motorcycles too.andM;MIT has fostered the notion that the U.S.andP;  computer systems vendors, exceptIBM, are doomed.andP;  The theory is founded on the premise of the &quot;value chain.&quot;andO;By controlling the supply and pricing of semi-conductor at the start of thevalue chain, the theory goes, the vertically integrated Japanesecomputer-communications semi-conductor companies soon will have the power todominate hardware manufacturing.andP;  The companies in question include Fujitsu,hitachi, Matsushita.andP;  Nippon Electric and Toshiba.andM;Once they in fact are dominant, who would doubt that they will use their newpower to  extract economic tribute as well as encroach seriously on the U.S.andO;companies' worldwide market share?andP;  Again, I think this pessimistic scenariothat views as almost inevitable a Japanese takeover of the Hardware side ofthe computer business is an overstatement.andM;The Japanese PresenceandM;To be sure, as original equipment manufacturer suppliers of computerperipherals, IBM-compatible low end PCs and RAM chips to name a fewoutstanding examples, the Japanese have made their presence felt in NorthAmerica and Europe.andP;  And prospects are that they soon will be major playersin supercomputers, optical storage, imaging, speech recognition and Unixworkstations.andM;And we cannot overlook the fact that through its 47 percent ownership ofAmdahl Corp., Fujitsu has a major role in the IBM-compatible mainframe niche,as does Hitachi via its newly established Hitachi Data System subsidiary.andO;Via these two channels, by 1991 the Japanese may control 24 percent of thehigh-end IBM-compatible mainframe market, about double the share they hadjust three or four years ago.andM;These admittedly impressive achievements, compared with where the Japanesewere in the late 1970s, however, don't signal the beginning of the end forour computer systems vendors.andP;  Remember, these are mostly large, mutinationalcompanies with worldwide cutomer bases valued in the tens of billions ofdollars.andM;Some systems vendors may not make it or may hang in as competitive pressuresmount and minicomputer and mainframe markets mature.andM;Such a regretable outcome world reflect the consequences of poor managementin the late 1980s and early 1990s rather than the impact of the Japaneseonslaught.andP;  It is heartening that these companies' management are matureenough not to blame the Japanese for their troubles as do the U.S.andO;semiconductor companies.andM;On the software and services side, the Japanese are hardly seen or heardoutside their home market.andP;  Voices are being heard warning that a Japaneseinvasion of the software and services industries is just around the corner.andO;In the absence of even marginally credible and convincing evidence, I amdisinclined to view this prospect with alarm.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington comsulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
