The translator is Adin Steinsaltz, an Orthodox rabbi and notedTalmud scholar. The project will be published in stages, with thefirst three volumes expected by 1990.   Steinsaltz, of the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications inJerusalem, said the effort may entail as many as 15 volumes andtake 10 years to complete.   Peter Osnos, the Random House associate publisher who will editthe project, said the volumes will probably cost $30 to $40 each.   ``We have now possibly a major part of the Jewish people whosenative tongue is English,'' Steinsaltz said, ``and who really arenot comfortable in any other language.''   The translation will be of the Babylonian Talmud, compiled inthe sixth century after Christ and considered more authoritativethan the shorter Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud.   The University of Chicago Press has published 22 of a projected36 volumes of the Jerusalem Talmud in English.</TEXT></DOC>
