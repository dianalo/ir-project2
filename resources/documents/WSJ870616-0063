It's what the Pentagon calls humanitarian civic assistance.    But this shipment wasn't destined for typical civilian victims of such natural disasters as droughts or floods. It was one of 25 plane-loads donated by the Pentagon to the Afghan rebels who are battling the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.    For the first time since the Vietnam War era, the Defense Department is moving back into the humanitarian-aid business. This year's defense authorization bill added humanitarian activities to the military's official mission. And under recently inaugurated programs, the Pentagon donated a surplus ambulance to the Knights of Malta for use in Lebanon, gave tractors to refugees in Somalia, and transported without charge 1.6 million pounds of merchandise donated by private-aid groups.    But critics charge that often the Pentagon is using such assistance as a weapon against communism rather than as a humanitarian tool for needy civilians. They fear this distorts the purpose of humanitarian assistance and can lead to abuses. The biggest user of the program to provide free transportation for private donors, for instance, has been Friends of the Americas, a Louisiana-based group whose co-director was closely linked to a fund-raising effort for the Nicaraguan Contras.    &quot;Is humanitarian aid -- disinterested aid to people in need -- consistent with the Defense Department's overall mission?&quot; asks John Swenson, deputy director of external affairs for Catholic Relief Services. &quot;We think it's not. The military has a military mission.&quot;    In El Salvador, a group of congressional aides learned during a February visit that some U.S. food aid was used to prod local peasants into siding with the government. In some villages, the food, which is distributed by the Salvadoran military under the sponsorship of the U.S. military, was being given only to those peasants who agreed to serve in the rural civil defense.    It is the guerrilla conflicts in Central America that have spurred the U.S. military to find ways to compete for the hearts and minds of local populations. &quot;It's all part of the low-intensity conflict arena,&quot; says Robert Wolthuis, director of the Pentagon's humanitarian assistance office. &quot;It's a tool in helping people feel better about the U.S. military presence and local military forces.&quot;    The U.S. military always has engaged in so-called civic action projects, which include government-to-government activities such as building roads or bridges. But humanitarian assistance, traditionally the domain of civilians, is geared more toward providing food, clothing or medical services to individuals. In Vietnam, the lines between the military and civilian agencies became blurred, with intelligence operators, for example, often using positions in the Agency for International Development, or AID, as &quot;cover.&quot; So after the war, the two functions were separated.    Some legislators want to make sure that the old problems from Vietnam don't crop up again. &quot;I wouldn't prohibit military involvement in distributing supplies,&quot; says Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D., Pa.). &quot;But it's appropriate for Congress to begin thinking about developing with the Defense Department some kind of mechanism to make sure it doesn't become a problem and that the military doesn't use humanitarian assistance to fulfill its own agenda.&quot;    Some State Department and AID officials are wary of the Pentagon's incursion onto their turf. One AID official worries that in conflict zones, such as El Salvador, the military's top priority will be to end leftist insurgencies, rather than to attain AID's long-term economic goals. But the Pentagon showed how it could stretch AID's reach providing drought relief in sub-Saharan Africa in late 1984. It airlifted a Chinook helicopter on a C-5 transport from Portland, Ore., to Khartoum, Sudan, and put a pontoon ferry on the Niger River, near Gao, Mali, that became a key link in moving grain inland from Africa's west coast.    As a result, AID reluctantly welcomed the Pentagon. &quot;I might feel differently if budgets are growing again in a couple of years,&quot; says Richard Bissell, an AID assistant administrator.    Meanwhile, the Defense Department was getting some help from Congress. A 1985 bill authored by Sen. Jeremiah Denton (R., Ala.) authorized the Pentagon to transport for free, when space was available on military aircraft, humanitarian aid provided by private groups. The Defense Department has shipped the dismantled office of a retired dentist to Honduras under this program.    But some critics suspect that the prime user of this service, Friends of the Americas, may be aiding Contra family members from its distribution center in Rus Rus, Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border. The group's co-director, Woody Jenkins, was a co-chairman of a $250-a-person, major fund-raising dinner for the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund held in Washington in 1985 honoring President Reagan. Mr. Jenkins, a well-known conservative political activist, said through a spokeswoman that the group is &quot;out to help the poorest of the poor in Latin America . . . and that includes victims of wars and revolutions.&quot;    The Pentagon worked with Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.) in 1986 on a measure that authorized the military to give away surplus property. As of May 31, the Defense Department had shipped 595 tons of excess nonlethal military goods under this program, including material for the Afghan guerrillas.    The Pentagon got its biggest boost last year when Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) sponsored the legislative change that added humanitarian assistance to the military's mission. Previously the Pentagon performed such activities only at the request of the State Department or AID, and billed these agencies for its services.    Initially, the Pentagon is authorized to spend $3 million annually for its own projects. Not much by Pentagon standards, but Mr. Wolthuis views this as only a start and says the military can stretch the money by absorbing salary and transportation expenses. Host countries sometimes donate the supplies, he notes.    ---                 Humanitarian Aid   Eight largest recipients of clothing, hand tools and othersuch items, donated by private groups and transported by theDefense Department from October 1984 to May 1987: Country                          Pounds Honduras                         896,512 Philippines                      358,337 El Salvador                       84,755 Guatemala                         71,845 Peru                              71,519 Panama                            48,498 Costa Rica                        34,388 Colombia                          33,750   (Revised WSJ June 18, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
