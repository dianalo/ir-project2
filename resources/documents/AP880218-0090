He said the Soviet Union hopes that the visit of Secretary ofState George Shultz to Moscow next week ``will provide thenecessary clarity as to the further intentions'' of the U.S. sideregarding the arms talks in Geneva.   The two sides have said they are trying to conclude a treaty onreducing their intercontinental, or strategic, nuclear forces by 50percent in time for an expected U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Mayor June. But both sides have said a summit could be held even if atreaty were not ready for signing.   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union is ``convinced'' that a treatycould still be prepared in time for signing at a summit in thefirst half of this year. But he said, ``A whole set of ratherdifficult issues remains to be solved.''   He reiterated the Soviet position that the main issue still tobe resolved is the question of compliance with the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Senior U.S. arms control adviser Edward Rowny said Monday inBoston that the Soviets were using delaying tactics at the Genevatalks. He said the Soviets could speed up progress on strategicarms reductions by abandoning their efforts to link such reductionsto U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative research.   Petrovsky said the U.S. position at the talks ``impedes reachingagreement on the reductions in strategic offensive arms.'' Forexample, he said, the United States was refusing to include limitson sea-launched cruise missiles because they say such limits wouldbe difficult to verify.   ``This being so, the situation at the space and nuclear talkshas now noticeably deteriorated,'' said Petrovsky.   Petrovsky also suggested that the Conference on Disarmament, theworld's only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, startnegotiating on eliminating nuclear weapons in all countries whichpossess them.   At a press conference, he said ``the time has come'' to takeinto account the nuclear arsenals of China, Britain and France, aswell as of the United States and Soviet Union, which are alreadynegotiating reductions in their forces.   ``The Soviet Union suggests to start immediately identifying inpractice the substance of possible multilateral measures in thisfield,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
