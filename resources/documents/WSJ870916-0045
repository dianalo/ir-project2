Trading was quiet, largely because of yesterday's national holiday in Japan.    The U.S. currency took its biggest fall against the Japanese yen, slipping to 143.63 yen in late New York trading from 144.58 late Monday. After the dollar failed to rise above 145 yen Monday, traders said, many investors decided the currency had reached its peak.    &quot;After the quick run-up we saw on Friday, we're just consolidating,&quot; Marcia Lalla, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York, said. &quot;We haven't come off very far from the tops we saw (Monday). It's not a market that has collapsed.&quot;    William Samela, first vice president at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York, said that after the gains of the past few days, traders thought they were turning too bullish.    &quot;They got themselves long in the last couple of days and couldn't hold those levels,&quot; he said.    Yesterday's report of a 1.3% increase in U.S. retail sales for August disappointed some traders who had been expecting a 2% rise. But most said the number wasn't a major factor in their market strategies.    That left the market to focus on the U.S. July trade deficit of $16.47 billion. The dollar posted gains Friday and Monday despite Friday's trade-deficit report, then began giving back those gains yesterday.    Yani M.A. Budiman, a vice president at Chemical Bank, New York, said: &quot;It all depends on your interpretation of the trade number. The sentiment is fairly mixed in the market between people who believe the dollar should trade higher and people who think the dollar should trade lower.&quot;    Mr. Budiman said he believes that fund managers and Japanese companies have been supporting the dollar.    Although many traders continued to express bearish views on the U.S. currency, some forecast that Japanese investors will keep buying dollars until Japan's fiscal first half ends Sept. 30.    John Lynam, a vice president in New York for Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles, said Japanese buying will create demand for dollars. But, he said, this short-term buying will turn to longer-term selling. He said he expects the dollar to drop within the next month or so and to test its nearly 40-year low of 137 yen reached April 27.    The dollar was quoted at 143.57 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Mr. Samela said he expects more dollar-selling, led by Japanese institutions. He said he heard speculation yesterday that those institutions were leaving the U.S. bond market.    &quot;The Japanese are leading the way (by selling the dollar), and I think the rest of the market will follow,&quot; he said. &quot;If the Japanese institutions are bailing out of the market, then we'll definitely see lower levels.&quot;    Shigeru Tokunaga, a vice president in New York for Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd., said Japanese participants &quot;now have a wait-and-see attitude toward where the bond market will go.&quot;    Wayne Angell, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said in a speech in Toronto yesterday that the Fed's recent increase in its discount rate to 6% from 5 1/2% should be sufficient to combat the threat of inflation.    Security Pacific's Mr. Lynam, who contends that the Fed raised the discount rate to support the dollar, said Mr. Angell's comments were expected.    &quot;I think that if push comes to shove and they really need to support the dollar, they will,&quot; he said.    Mr. Angell declined to forecast the direction of the U.S. dollar or of other currencies. But he said that as long as the U.S. keeps its money supply growth &quot;in the 3% to 4% range&quot; while West German and Japanese money supply growth stays around 10% to 12% a year, &quot;then the long-term outlook for the U.S. dollar remains positive.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose to $458.60 an ounce in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $458.55 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                    Tuesday, Sept. 15, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
