The results clearly show peaklikeanomalies which allow us to obtain the critical temperature for the phasetransition. We have also measured the magnetization parallel and perpendicularto the applied magnetic field on magnetically aligned powder samplesin order to determine the thermal evolution of the orientation of theeasy magnetization direction. The compounds with intermediate concentrations(0.2{le}x{le}0.8) present two peaklike anomalies in the range of temperaturemeasured (3.5--350 K), which have been associated with critical phenomenarelated to the SRT (axial{yields}cone 1 and cone 1{yields}cone 2). Theremaining concentrations display SRT axial{yields}planar in the caseof Er-rich compounds and axial{yields}cone in the Nd-rich ones.</TEXT></DOC>
