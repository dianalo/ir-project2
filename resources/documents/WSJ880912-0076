White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><DATELINE> BANGKOK, Thailand  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Burmese government's pledge to end 26 years of one-party rule and hold multiparty elections later this year was a stunning victory for people's power in yet another Asian dictatorship.    But the leadership's concessions, sweeping though they are, don't appear to be enough to end the nationwide protests calling for the government's ouster, and diplomats warned the threat of new violence can't be ruled out.    An emergency session of the People's Assembly, or parliament, voted yesterday to hold a general multiparty election in about three months. The assembly endorsed a decision made Saturday by the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party to forego a proposed national referendum on single-party political rule and move directly to multiparty elections.    But a Western diplomat said &quot;there's been no detectable softening of the public mood, and events may well move faster,&quot; given the government's refusal to step aside in favor of a neutral interim government.    &quot;The opposition's made it clear that any election held under {ruling party} sponsorship isn't acceptable, and the government's move is seen as still keeping power in the hands of the {ruling party},&quot; he said.    In a speech to the parliament yesterday, President Maung Maung indicated the government would adopt a tougher stance towards anti-government activists &quot;to restore law and order all over the country.&quot;    Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched peacefully yesterday through the streets of Rangoon, the capital, and Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city. The demonstrations, reminiscent of the popular protests that have ousted dictatorships in the Philippines and South Korea in recent years, called for an immediate dissolution of the ruling party, resignation of the current government and the establishment of an interim government to oversee multiparty general elections.    For the first time since nationwide antigovernment demonstrations began in July, small contingents of army, navy and air force personnel and large groups of police joined in protests over the weekend. But diplomats said there were no firm indications that military leaders' support for the embattled regime of Mr. Maung Maung is weakening.    Meanwhile, widespread strikes have brought the country to a virtual standstill, and shortages of food in Rangoon have become acute because of the breakdown in the country's transport system. &quot;I'm afraid that will make the unrest worse&quot; in coming days, an Asian diplomat said.    At the ruling party's meeting Saturday, Mr. Maung Maung, its chairman, strongly criticized the party, which was set up by Ne Win to consolidate power following his 1962 coup. Mr. Ne Win ruled for more than a quarter century before resigning July 23.    &quot;The weakness of the party was it was born as a ruling party and grew up as one,&quot; without &quot;making sacrifices, taking risks and working hard to overcome difficulties,&quot; Mr. Maung Maung said. &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; The president told party delegates that &quot;elections will be held as quickly as possible and in the fairest and most free manner.&quot;    Meanwhile, an attempt at the formation of an alternative government, launched Friday, has floundered. U Nu, whose government was overthrown by Ne Win, set up a 26-member cabinet with himself as prime minister, and called for general elections Oct. 9. But no foreign government has recognized Mr. U Nu's government, and on Saturday three of the ministers named to his cabinet resigned. Diplomats said the three resigned because they viewed Mr. U Nu's attempt as premature, and as a bid to exploit the chaotic situation for personal political gain.    The Bar Council of Burma said that students, who have been the driving force behind anti-government protests, and other opposition groups hadn't been consulted before Mr. U Nu's announcement. </TEXT></DOC>
