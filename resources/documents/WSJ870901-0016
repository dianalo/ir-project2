CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UISCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. will unveil three midsized computers tomorrow in an attempt to compete more aggressively with Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., a source at the company said.    The source at Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys said the machines will employ the same architecture used in the company's &quot;A series&quot; mainframes, thus extending that family's range of compatibility to the new Unisys machines. Digital has successfully exploited that strategy of enhancing connectivity between its computers and IBM has begun to use it as well.    Increasing the breadth of machines with compatible architectures has become a crucial competitive factor because it allows users to link machines easily and to run nearly identical software on a wide range of computers.    IBM and Digital dominate the market for midrange computers, while Unisys usually does well in selling to certain industries and existing customers. But the source said the computer maker will try to overcome those limitations by pricing the new machines aggressively and including more software and support in the purchase price than the industry leading competitors currently offer.    &quot;This is probably the single most important announcement of a new product&quot; in the year since Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp. merged to form Unisys, Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal said in an interview. He declined to elaborate or confirm any details about the announcement.    Ulric Weil, an analyst affiliated with Gartner Securities, said, &quot;This will open some doors. Will it cause radical change? No. But it'll let them establish beachheads in some DEC and IBM accounts.&quot;    The Unisys source said the machines, to be called the A1, the A4 and the A6, will be marketed against the Models 20, 40 and 60 respectively of IBM's new 9370 line, joining the competition for small-business accounts and for sales to departments in large companies.    While conceding that price and performance comparisons are notoriously difficult in the computer industry, the source said the A1 will have about the same power as the Model 20 but will cost 20% less. The A4 will cost about the same as the Model 40 but will have 60% more performance and the A6 will cost about 10% more than the Model 60 with about 33% more power, the source said.    Unisys will include with the hardware the operating system -- the basic layer of software that runs the machine -- plus application software and training. The packages will be aimed at the industrial and commercial, financial and public sector markets, areas where Unisys does well.    Competitors typically offer packages that include only the operating system, so this marks another step in the industry trend toward selling turnkey systems -- the industry vernacular for selling solutions, not boxes.    &quot;Surely if this succeeds, if they finally succeed in getting into IBM accounts, then I'm sure they'll expand this concept&quot; to cover other product lines, Mr. Weil said. </TEXT></DOC>
