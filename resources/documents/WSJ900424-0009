Your arguments, whether ornot one agrees with them, are generally cogent, and at timeselegantly expressed. Always, in my memory, they have beenmodels of diction.   Yet on March 20 you told us that Congress continues to&quot;flaunt&quot; (a word meaning &quot;to display ostentatiously&quot;) therevised minimum-wage law. You meant &quot;flout&quot; (&quot;to mock orinsult; to treat with contempt&quot;). No Caesar I, but you haveplunged a dagger deep into the heart of this old lover of theEnglish language.</LP><TEXT>   Willard R. Espy   New York   ---   Your message is well worth an editorial, if not afront-page article, but the first sentence probably confusedmany readers. &quot;Flaunt&quot; generally means to show offostentatiously, as in &quot;flaunting his superiority.&quot; Instead,Congress is flouting the minimum-wage law, treating it withscornful disregard. While &quot;flaunt&quot; does carry this as asecondary meaning, its use in this context was confusing,since Congress often trumpets its newest legislation.   Jonathan V. Snyder   Philadelphia   ---   Tsk. To flout flout you flaunt flaunt.   Instead, you should flaunt flout and so flout flaunt.   William W. Hall   Richland Center, Wis.   ---   You say Congress is going to &quot;flaunt a major piece ofrecently enacted federal legislation.&quot; No doubt this is theresult of a misquotation on congressional defiance ofminimum-wage legislation. No member of Congress said, &quot;Iflaunt to be alone.&quot; There was, however a clear chorus of&quot;Flout, flout, damned spot]&quot;   This modest adjustment to reality is offered in a spiritof constructive good will and is not intended to flouterudition or flaunt convention.
