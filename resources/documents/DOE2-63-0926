The prototype system is capable of providing a visual recordof combustor flame images, recording flame spectral data, analyzing imageand spectral data, and diagnosing certain engine malfunctions. The systemshould provide useful diagnostic information to utility plant operators,and reduce maintenance costs. The field tests demonstrated the abilityof the CVP to monitor combustor flame condition and to relate changesin the engine operation with variations in the flame signature. Enginelight off, run up to full speed, the addition of load, and the effectof water injection for NO{sub x} control could easily be identified onthe video monitor. The viewing probe was also valuable in identifyinghard startups and shutdowns, as well as transient effects that can seriouslyharm the engine. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
