HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of adoptees, birth mothers andadoptive parents wound up a 250-mile march from New York to thenation's capital Friday pressing for the unsealing of confidentialbirth records.   But the president of another adoption group disagreed with theirpoint, saying, ``People have a right to privacy.''   Forty members of the American Adoption Congress ended the2{-week trek by rallying in front of the District of Columbia'sOffice of Vital Records while five members went inside to requestoriginal birth certificates.   The three birth mothers and two adoptees were turned down _ asother members of the group had been in New York, Philadelphia andBaltimore _ after they spoke to D.C. Registrar Jack Crandall.   Crandall, an adoptive father himself, explained, ``I have theold nothing answer, I guess, because it's the law. The law saysthat when a person is adopted ... we create a new birth certificateand the old certificate is under seal and can only be opened byorder of the court.''   Birth mothers told of the pain of giving up their infants andthen struggling to find them years later.   ``It's understood that you're giving him up to people who are somuch better, and you don't have any rights at all,'' said LauraLewis, 39, of suburban Maryland.   Adopted children spoke of their frustrations in trying to tracetheir blood roots while being denied access to original birthrecords, including medical histories.   ``I've just been diagnosed as hypoglycemic,'' said JannineSutherland, 42, of Gaithersburg, Md., ``and I want to know, doesdiabetes run in my family?''   But William Pierce, president of the National Committee forAdoption, which represents 141 adoption agencies and 2,000individuals, said in a telephone interview, ``The courts have saidrather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater thanthe right to the information.''   Adoption Congress president Kate Burke said, ``If a birth motherdoesn't want to be found, all she has to say is, `I don't want arelationship''' when her child contacts her.   Pierce said he favored a ``middle-of-the-road compromise.''   ``There should be a sensitive legal way for adults to be able toget together if they both want to,'' he said, describing a mutualconsent arrangement in 22 states that allows birth mothers andtheir adult children to meet if both register to express such adesire.   Ten states have a system that allows adult adoptees to request asearch for their mothers, said Pierce. If she is located, the womancan decide whether she wants to meet the child.   Three states _ Alaska, Alabama and Kansas _ open records once anadoptee reaches age 18, and the remainder of the states have sealedrecords, Pierce said.</TEXT></DOC>
