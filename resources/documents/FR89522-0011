Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityUnder 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained at 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. Petitionersmust provide sufficient information to EPA to allow the Agency to determinethat: (1) The waste to be excluded is not hazardous based upon the criteriafor which it was listed, and (2) that no other hazardous constituents arepresent in the waste at levels of regulatory concern.B. History of this RulemakingBethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem), located in Steelton, Pennsylvania,and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, petitioned the Agency to exclude from hazardouswaste control a specific waste it intends to generate. After evaluatingthe two petitions, on June 23, 1988, EPA proposed to exclude Bethlehem'swastes from the lists of hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,conditional upon Bethlehem meeting certain sampling, analysis, and reportingrequirements. See 53 FR 23661.Bethlehem petitioned the Agency for an ``upfront'' exclusion. A petitionerrequests an upfront exclusion for wastes that have not yet been generatedor that will be subject to further treatment. When treatment is plannedan upfront delising petition requests that an exclusion be granted basedon untreated waste characteristics, pilot-scale treatment data if available,and process descriptions. As a condition of an upfront exclusion, the Agencymay impose batch testing requirements, which often include analytical testingof representative samples obtained from the full-scale system. These datacan be used to verify that the treatment system, once on-line, is operatingas described in the petition. The Agency may also specify verificationtesting limitations (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the maximum allowable levels of hazardous constituents ofconcern in the waste) in the conditions of the granted exclusion. Whenthe actual levels of the constitutents of concern are below these levels,the waste will not be considered hazardous. If the actual levels of theconstituents are above these levels, the waste is still considered to behazardous and must be retreated or disposed in accordance with RCRA SubtitleC requirements.This rulemaking addresses public comments received on the proposal andfinalizes the proposed exclusions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petitions</ITAG>Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Steelton, Pennsylvania, and Bethlehem SteelCorporation, Johnstown, Pennsylvania1. Proposed ExclusionsBethlehem petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion of its chemicallystabilized electric arc furnace dust (CSEAFD), presently listed as EPAHazardous Waste No. K061. Bethlehem's petitions were based on the claimthat the constituents of concern, although present in the waste, were inan essentially immobile form (<T3>i.e., </T3>cement-like). Furthermore, to support its claim that boththe non-listed and listed constituents of concern would not be presentin the CSEAFD above health-based levels of concern, Bethlehem submittedresults from total constituent, EP toxicity, and multiple extraction procedure(MEP) analyses (used to assess stabilized wastes) for all the EP toxicmetals, nickel and cyanide. These analyses were performed on representativesamples of both the uncured (<T3>i.e., </T3>paste) CSEAFD, and the fully-cured (<T3>i.e., </T3>hardened) CSEAFD generated using a laboratory-scale treatmentsystem.The Agency evaluated the information and analytical data provided by Bethlehemfor its untreated electric arc furnace dust and uncured CSEAFD and fully-curedCSEAFD generated from a laboratory-scale waste treatment process and determinedthat the hazardous constituents found in the waste would not pose a threatto human health and the environment. Specifically, the Agency used itsvertical and horizontal spread (VHS) model to predict the potential mobilityof the hazardous constituents in the petitioned waste. Based on this evaluation,the Agency determined that the constituents in Bethlehem's waste wouldnot leach and migrate at concentrations above the health-based levels usedin delisting decision-making. Since Bethlehem's petitions were based onlaboratory-scale waste treatment systems, the Agency further used the VHSmodel to establish concentration levels (<T3>i.e., </T3>delisting levels) for the hazardous constituents in thewaste to be generated from the full-scale waste treatment process. Theproposed exclusions set maximum constituent concentration levels permissiblein the CSEAFD generated from the full-scale waste treatment process andestablished testing conditions to verify that the levels of hazardous constituentsin the petitioned waste do not exceed permissible levels. The verificationtesting conditions attached to the exclusions are designed to ensure thatthese constituents will not be present in both the uncured and fully-curedCSEAFD at concentrations above the health-based levels used in delistingdecision-making. See 53 FR 23661, June 23, 1988, for a detailed explanationof EPA's proposal to grant Bethlehem's petitions.2. Agency Response to Public CommentsThe Agency received public comments on the proposed rule from five commenters.Two of the five commenters supported the Agency's proposed decision toexclude both the uncured CSEAFD and the fully-cured CSEAFD, while the otherthree commenters opposed the Agency's decision. The technical correctionsand suggested modifications to the proposed rule made by one of the twosupporting commenters and the objections raised by the three opposing commentersare discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">Corrections and Clarifications to the Rulemaking Record</ITAG>One commenter wished to clarify the rulemaking record. The commenter notedthat the Agency, using information contained in Bethlehem's petitions,stated in the preamble for the proposed rule that Bethlehem's Steeltonfacility produces reinforcing bars, billets, and associated rail products,and that Bethlehem's Johnstown facility produces reinforcing bars, rodsand wire (see 53 FR 23663, June 23, 1988 and 53 FR 23666, June 23, 1988,respectively). The commenter stated that the principal products producedat the Steelton facility actually are: (1) Rails and associated rail products,(2) blooms for rolling into structural shapes at the facility, and (3)other semi-finished blooms and billets. Additionally, the commenter statedthat the Steelton facility has not manufactured reinforcing bars sinceFebruary 1986, and the facility has not produced steel for such bars, whichhave relatively low grade metallurgical specifications, since late 1985.The commenter also stated that the Johnstown facility has never producedreinforcing bars and that the principal products produced at the facilityactually are carbon and alloy bars, rods, wire, and semi-finished billets.The commenter also wished to correct several typographical errors madein Table 1, Table 3, and Table 4 of the June 23, 1988 proposal (see 53FR 23664-23665). The commenter correctly pointed out that the maximum totalconstituent concentrations for selenium and nickel were transposed in Table1. Data contained in Bethlehem's petition indicated maximum total constituentconcentrations for selenium and nickel as non-detectable when using a detectionlimit of 10 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Data presented for seleniumand nickel in Table 3 also were inadvertently transposed. Data containedin Bethlehem's petition indicated maximum multiple extraction procedure(MEP) concentrations for selenium and nickel as non-detectable when usinga detection limit of 0.01  mg/l and 0.02 mg/l, respectively. As the commenterpointed out, the transposition of the selenium data resulted in the Agency'sincorrect evaluation of selenium using the VHS model (see Table 4, 53 FR23665). Because the maximum MPE concentration for selenium was mistakenlypresented as 0.02 mg/1, the Agency evaluated this value using the VHS model.However, as stated in the preamble, the Agency believes that it is inappropriateto evaluate non-detectable concentrations of constituents of concern (<T3>i.e., </T3>selenium) in its modeling efforts if the non-detectablevalue was obtained using the appropriate analytical method (see 53 FR 23665).Therefore, the Agency should not have included selenium on Table 4, 53FR 23665.The commenter also stated that the Agency significantly understated thenumber of uncured and fully-cured CSEAFD samples that were tested for theEP toxicity leachate concentrations of cadmium, chromium, and lead. Thecommenter correctly pointed out that the Steelton petition contained datafrom the EP toxicity leachate test on cadmium, chromium, and lead from37 samples of the uncured CSEAFD and 27 samples of the fully-cured CSEAFD.The commenter also correctly pointed out that the Johnstown petition containeddata from the EP toxicity leachate test on cadmium, chromium, and leadfrom 21 samples of the uncured CSEAFD and 38 samples of the fully-curedCSEAFD. The Agency did evaluate these data; however, the Agency inaccuratelysummarized all the data contained in the petitions and the numerous additionalanalytical reports submitted by Bethlehem.<ITAG tagnum="81">Petition-Specific Comments</ITAG>Two commenters opposed the Agency's handling of information on Bethlehem'sstabilization process as proprietary. Both commenters believed that withoutspecific details concerning Bethlehem's stabilization process and the physical/chemicalcomposition of the stabilized waste, their ability to provide ``meaningful''public comment was seriously restricted.The Agency disagrees with the commenters. As specified in 40 CFR 260.2(b),Bethlehem is entitled to assert a claim of business confidentiality coveringpart or all of the information submitted to EPA in fulfillment of the informationrequirements of andSection;andSection; 260.20 and 260.22. Furthermore, Bethlehemfollowed the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 2.203(b) pertaining to confidentialbusiness information. Bethlehem provided the Agency with confidential informationdetailing the stabilization process. Substantial resources have been investedto develop the stabilization process, and Bethlehem is entitled to protectthis information in order to license its process and to maintain commercialviability. Furthermore, Bethlehem did not seek to protect as confidentialany waste-specific information. Data characterizing the physical and chemicalcomposition of the untreated waste, the uncured CSEAFD, and the fully-curedCSEAFD were provided in the exclusion petitions. The Agency evaluated allinformation submitted. Information that was not claimed to be confidentialis available in the RCRA public docket for public inspection.One of the two commenters also believed that Bethlehem, by asserting aclaim of business confidentiality, would be able to secretly amend itstreatment process through a simple series of correspondence with the Agency.The commenter claimed that Bethlehem could alter its treatment processwithout the public's knowledge, since the public would not know the specificsof Bethlehem's treatment process. The commenter further believed that allowingBethlehem to alter its treatment process would be inconsistent with pastdelistings that have been granted, which have tied the decision to delistthe waste to use of the precise treatment process outlined in the petition.The Agency strongly disagrees with the commenter's claim that Bethlehemwould be able to ``secretly'' amend its treatment process through a simpleseries of correspondence. The Agency explicitly stated in the proposedrulemaking (53 FR 23666 and 23670), that if made final, the proposed exclusionswill only apply to the processes and volumes covered by the original demonstration;therefore, if Bethlehem significantly alters either its manufacturing ortreatment processes, a new exclusion will be required. In this event, theAgency would require Bethlehem to handle its waste as hazardous until anew exclusion were granted. The Agency, regardless of whether a petitioner'sprocess is covered by a claim of business confidentiality, prohibits anypetitioner from altering either its manufacturing or treatment processesbecause waste generated from an altered process (or processes) potentiallywould no longer exhibit the same characteristics as the waste upon whichthe petitioner's original demonstration was based. One commenter stated that it strongly opposed the Agency's proposal togrant Bethlehem an exclusion for six reasons, each of which is discussedbelow. A seventh concern, regarding the initial and subsequent testingrequirements is addressed in a later section_<T3>Conditional Testing and Reporting Requirements.</T3>The commenter stated that the CSEAFD (both uncured and fully-cured) stillexhibits one of the criteria for which it was listed_the presence of significantconcentrations of the inorganic constituents of concern (<T3>i.e.,</T3> cadmium, chromium, and lead). The commenter also statedthat the waste contains significant concentrations of nickel. The Agency agrees that the presence in K061 wastes of significant totalconcentrations of the inorganic constituents of concern was one of thecriteria for listing K061 wastes as ``T'' (toxic) wastes. See 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(ii)and ``Background Document, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, SubtitleC, Hazardous Waste Management, section 3001, Identification and Listingof Hazardous Waste, '' 1980. The Agency, however, believes that data presentedin the Background Document characterize the physical/chemical nature ofuntreated electric arc furnace dusts and that these data are not representativeof the physical/chemical nature of stabilized electric arc furnace dusthaving a cement-like waste matrix. Specifically, EPA believes it is reasonable to expect that, as the totalconstituent concentration of an unbound or loosely bound metal presentin a waste increases, the potential for the metal to leach from the wastealso increases (generally, the higher the total constituent concentrationof an unbound or loosely bound metal, the higher the potential EP leachateconcentration). Thus, wastes having significant total constituent concentrationof unbound or loosely bound metals are more likely to impact the underlyingground water than wastes having lower total constituent concentrationsof unbound or loosely bound metals. In this case, however, the metals inBethlehem's waste are tightly bound within the waste's cement-like matrix.Thus, the Agency believes that the elevated levels of the metals presentin Bethlehem's waste should not pose a threat to either human health orthe environment. The Agency's conclusion that the inorganic constituentsof concern (including nickel) are bound in the waste matrix and thus arenot available for leaching is supported by the results of the EP and MEPleachate analyses. EPA evaluated the potential mobility of Bethlehem's stabilized waste usingthe maximum EP or MEP leachate concentrations and the vertical and horizontalspread (VHS) model. For the average annual volume of waste estimated tobe generated by Bethlehem, the VHS model predicted a dilution factor ofapproximately 6.3. The Agency believes that the VHS model analysis providesa conservative and reasonable worst-case evaluation of the waste's effecton the underlying aquifer. The predicted compliance-point concentrationsresulting from this conservative analysis were below the levels of concernused for delisting purposes. See 53 FR 23664 and 23668, June 23, 1988,for descriptions of the modeling analysis of Bethlehem's wastes. Furthermore, in delisting evaluations, EPA considers all the factors forwhich the waste was listed, as well as factors other than those for whichthe waste was originally listed that could cause the waste to be hazardous.See 42 U.S.C. andSection; 6921(f). For this specific wastestream, based onthe above discussion, EPA does not believe that any other factors, includingelevated total concentrations of the inorganic constituents of concernand nickel, could cause this wastestream to present a hazard to human healthand the environment. The commenter also asserted that the Agency only considered the leachablelevels of hazardous constituents and did not consider airborne and waterbornedispersal of the waste. With regard to possible airborne dispersal, the Agency believes that thecommenter's concern was based primarily on the characterization of K061wastes in the listing background document as being fine particles of dust.The Agency believes that airborne exposure to hazardous contaminants fromBethlehem's EAF dust (fine particles) is not probable because Bethlehem'suntreated EAF dust will be regulated as a hazardous waste, thus releasesof the EAF dust to the atmosphere should be controlled. Additionally, dueto the physical and chemical nature of Bethlehem's stabilized waste (<T3>i.e.,</T3> monolithic and nonfriable), the Agency believes that directcontact from airborne exposure to hazardous contaminants from the CSEAFDis unlikely. With regard to waterborne dispersal of the waste, it is important to notethat Bethlehem's waste will be stabilized to produce a cement-like wastematrix and handled as hazardous until it is stabilized. The VHS model analysisdescribed in the proposal shows that leachate from the waste that travelsthrough ground water will not exceed health based levels.  The Agency acknowledges that it may also be possible for surface waterrunoff to transport contaminants from the waste to a nearby surface waterbody. However, the Agency does not believe that analysis of such overlandtransport of contaminants as a reasonable exposure route for the petitionedwaste would compel a different result for this petition. First, as describedin the proposed rule, the Agency believes that landfill disposal is a reasonableworst-case management scenario for Bethlehem's solidified waste. Contaminationof surface water might occur, therefore, through runoff from the petitionedwaste. However, EPA believes that the concentrations of my hazardous constituentsin that runoff will tend to be lower than the levels in the EP leachateanalyses reported in the proposal due to the acidic medium of the EP test.Furthermore, any transported constituents would be further diluted in thesurface water body.  Secondly, the Agency believes that, in general, the leachate derived fromthis waste will not directly enter a surface water body without first travellingthrough the saturated (subsurface) zone where dilution and attenuationof hazardous constituents may occur. The VHS model takes this saturatedzone into account as it predicts the ultimate fate and transport of hazardousconstituents. Lastly, if the wastes were exposed to any long-term weathering,the Agency believes that any significant overland transport of hazardousconstituents through erosion and runoff is highly unlikely for solidified(cement-like) wastes such as Bethlehem's.  The commenter further asserted that the at-the-well contribution of cadmium,chromium, and lead from Bethlehem's waste alone would be anywhere fromjust under a third to over a half of the amount allowed in drinking waterunder the current standards for these contaminants (<T3>i.e., </T3>the predicted compliance-point concentrations (CPCs) forcadmium, chromium, and lead are very close to their respective regulatorystandards). The commenter, therefore, stated that disposing of this wastewith any other contaminant source within the same landfill would readilycause exceedences of the standards.  As the Agency discussed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 26, 1985 and November 13, 1986 (50FR 7900 and 51 FR 41085), the VHS model analysis assumes that there areno other potential contaminant sources at the disposal site (<T3>i.e., </T3>leachate from the waste mixes with non-contaminated groundwater). Additionally, without specifying management conditions or consideringsite-specific characteristics, the Agency cannot modify the VHS model toassess the effects of additional contaminant sources on the underlyingaquifer within the same disposal site. The commenter is inferring thatwastes should not be delisted unless the predicted at-the-well concentrationsof the contaminants are significantly less than their respective health-basedlevels. The Agency does not have any technical basis to support a determinationof an appropriate percentage reduction and believes that any resultingpercentage reduction would be arbitrary. Furthermore, the commenter didnot suggest any technical basis for such a reduction. However, in lightof the conservative nature of the VHS model, EPA believes that the currentapproach is sufficiently protective of human health and the environment.EPA will continue to delist wastes that exhibit VHS-calculated CPC's upto 100 percent of the health-based standard.  The commenter was further troubled by the CPC for lead since EPA is consideringlowering the drinking water standard for lead to a maximum of 0.02 mg/land more likely to 0.01 mg/l or 0.005 mg/l. The commenter believes thatthe waste should be considered hazardous since, if the 0.01 mg/l standardis adopted, the calculated CPC would significantly exceed the standard. In making delisting decisions, the Agency uses the existing health-basedlevels cited in ``Docket Report on Health-Based Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988 (locatedin the RCRA public docket). EPA has no way of predicting the final drinkingwater standard until it is actually promulgated (the standard could beless than or greater than the proposed level or the 0.01 mg/l level citedby the commenter). Neither can the Agency be certain exactly when the newstandard might be promulgated. Without a new final drinking water standard,the Agency does not believe it is fair to the petitioner to postpone afinal delisting decision until a new drinking water standard for lead ispromulgated.  Lastly, the commenter believed that the Agency did not consider the possibilityof dioxin contamination. The commenter based its concern on data obtainedthrough the Agency's National Dioxin Study, Tier 4 Combustion Report. See``National Dioxin Study Tier 4 Combustion Sources: Engineering AnalysisReport,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planningand Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, EPA-450/4-84-014h,September, 1987.  The Agency disagrees with the commenter. EPA evaluated Bethlehem's petitionand did not believe that any other hazardous constituents, including dioxins,were present in Bethlehem's waste. In response to the commenter's specificconcern regarding the possibility of dioxin contamination, EPA reviewedthe Tier 4 report cited by the commenter. Although data presented in theTier 4 report indicated that dioxins were present in wastes generated bysecondary copper smelters and wire reclamation incinerators, the Agencydoes not consider it likely for dioxins to be present in Bethlehem's waste.As discussed in the Tier 4 report, the principal reasons for the possiblepresence of dioxins in wastes generated by secondary copper smelters andwire reclamation incinerators are the presence of dioxin-forming precursorsin raw materials and low combustion temperatures.  Specifically, the report noted that secondary copper smelters' raw materialscan contain quantities of polyvinyl chloride wire insulation (<T3>e.g., </T3>telephone wire), electrical parts, and other sources ofcopper (including circuit boards and electrical switches). Wire reclamationincinerators can process polyvinyl chloride wire insulation and polychlorinatedbiphenyl (PCB)_containing transformer cores and parts. These types of rawmaterials contain dioxin-forming precursors.  The report also found that combustion temperatures maintained by both secondarycopper smelters and wire reclamation incinerators are low enough to promotethe formation of dioxins. Surveyed secondary copper smelting furnaces operatedat approximately 1,500 anddegrees;F, and wire reclamation incinerators operatedat approximately 1,000 anddegrees;F (some had afterburners operating at 1,900anddegrees;F).  The Agency reviewed the list of scrap materials Bethlehem reported it usesto charge its furnaces, and the Agency does not believe that Bethlehemuses wire or electronic scrap. The Tier 4 report states that secondarycopper smelters and wire reclamation incinerators are less likely to generatedioxin-containing wastes if they do not use polyvinyl chloride coated wireand low combustion temperatures. Additionally, the Tier 4 report statedthat dioxins generally are destroyed at temperatures above 800 anddegrees;C(1472anddegrees; F), especially in incincerators with residence times of1.5_2.0 seconds or more. Bethlehem's furnaces heat the molten steel to3,000 anddegrees;F. Therefore, Bethlehem's furnaces run at more than twotimes the temperature required to destroy polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins(PCDDs), PCBs, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). EPA, based onthe above discussion, does not believe that it is reasonable to expectdioxins to be present in Bethlehem's waste.  The other two commenters opposed the Agency's proposal to grant Bethleheman exclusion because they believed that Bethlehem's process cannot work,that the process incorporates unnecessary dilution, and that the Agencyhas allowed Bethlehem to use unnecessary dilution.  The Agency disagrees with the commenters for the following reasons. TheAgency evaluated Bethlehem's treatment process and results from total constituentand EP leachate analyses, and believes that Bethlehem's stabilization processeffectively immobilizes all of the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanideas described earlier. Furthermore, the Agency believes that Bethlehem'sprocess does not employ unnecessary dilution in order to meet the delistinglevels. Table 1 presents a comparision of both the total constituent concentrationsof lead, cadmium, and chromium and the EP leachate concentrations of lead,cadmium, and chromium in the untreated and treated electric arc furnacedust, respectively. As evidenced by Table 1, the pilot-scale stabilizationprocess is reducing the mobility of these metals by significantly morethan the two to three times reduction attributable to dilution throughthe addition of reagents.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2(4,4,0),i1,s50,20,20,20</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Comparison of the Total and EP Leachate Concentrations of Lead, Cadmium,and Chromium in the Untreated EAF Dust With the Treated EAF Dust</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Steelton</H1><H2>Untreated EAFD (total concentration (mg/kg))</H2><H2>Treated EAFD (total concentration (mg/kg))</H2><H2>Ratio (untreated: treated)</H2>Constituents:<ITAG tagnum="3">Lead</ITAG><D>38,000</D><D>12,000</D><D>3.16:1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cadmium</ITAG><D>591</D><D>265</D><D>3.00:1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>1,100</D><D>900</D><D>1.22:1</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>EP concentration<D/>EP concentration<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>(mg/1)<D/>(mg/1)<R/><ITAG tagnum="3">Lead</ITAG><D>139</D><D>0.1</D><D>1,390:1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cadmium</ITAG><D>1.7</D><D>0.03</D><D>57:1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>0.93</D><D>0.16</D><D>6:1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s50,20,20,20</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Johnstown</H1><H2>Untreated EAFD (total concentration (mg/kg))</H2><H2>Treated EAFD (total concentration (mg/kg))</H2><H2>Ration (untreated: treated)</H2>Constituents:<ITAG tagnum="3">Lead</ITAG><D>20,000</D><D>7,000</D><D>2.85:1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cadmium</ITAG><D>300</D><D>200</D><D>1.50:1andCx.3;</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>2,400</D><D>1,200</D><D>2.00:1</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>EP concentration <D/>EP concentration<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>(mg/1)<D/>(mg/1)<R/><ITAG tagnum="3">Lead</ITAG><D>110</D><D>0.15</D><D>733:1.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cadmium</ITAG><D>3.6</D><D>0.04</D><D>90:1.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>0.05</D><D>0.18</D><D>1:3.6</D></ITAG>EPA notes that, as one of the commenters pointed out, for the Johnstownfacility, the EP leachate concentration of chromium in the CSEAFD appearsto be higher than the EP leachate concentration of chromium in the untreatedEAF dust. The Agency, when tabulating the data contained in Bethlehem'spetition, took the maximum values detected in all samples. As a result,the sample of untreated EAF dust, which yielded the highest EP leachateconcentration (<T3>e.g., </T3>chromium), was not the same sample that was treated andthen analyzed for EP leachate concentrations. Therefore, direct comparisonof the EP leachate concentrations of chromium in the untreated EAF dustand treated EAF dust results in the misleading appearance that Bethlehem'streatment process caused the EP leachate concentration of chromium to increase.The Agency reviewed the reagents used in Bethlehem's CSEAFD process anddoes not believe that the reagents supply additional chromiumThe commenter believed that Bethlehem's stabilization process utilizeda greater quantity of reagent than needed and that other stabilizationprocesses were capable of reducing leachable levels of the metals of concernwithout large volume increases as incurred by Bethlehem's process. Thecommenter stated that the Agency should adjust the leachate concentrationsfrom the treated wastes to account for the ``unnecessary'' dilution itbelieves that Bethlehem's process uses. The commenter further suggestedthat the leachate concentrations from the treated wastes should be adjustedby multiplying the leachate concentrations by the increase in volume fromthe untreated waste to the treated waste.The commenter is correct in stating that other available stabilizationprocesses may utilize a smaller volume of regents than does Bethlehem'sstabilization process. However, based on the Agency's analyses of Bethlehem'sstabilization process, the data in Table 1, and the above discussion, EPAdoes not believe that Bethlehem's process incorporates ``unnecessary''dilution since there does not appear to be a disproportionate relationshipbetween the increase in waste volume of the treated waste and the resultingdecrease in the constituent concentrations. Therefore, the Agency doesnot believe it is necessary to adjust the leachate concentrations as specifiedby the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="81">Data Collection and Analysis</ITAG>One commenter questioned five aspects of the data submitted by Bethlehemin support of these petitions. EPA's response to each of these issues follows.First, the commenter questioned how the Agency determined from merely fourlaboratory samples whether Bethlehem's waste was well mixed and uniformlyproduced. In response, the Agency notes that Bethlehem submitted significantlymore than four samples of the CSEAFD, as described in the proposal. Asnoted in the earlier section on corrections to the rulemaking, the petitionersubmitted data for 64 samples for the Steelton facility and 59 samplesfor the Johnstown facility. Furthermore, the Agency reviewed Bethlehem'smanufacturing process, list of products, and types of scrap used to chargethe steel making furnaces, and determined both that the raw waste samples(<T3>i.e., </T3>samples of the unstabilized waste) were representative ofthe types of steel currently being manufactured by Bethlehem, and thatBethlehem is not a multiple waste generator and/or operator of a multiplewaste treatment facility. Lastly, although the CSEAFD was produced in thelaboratory, the manufacturing process that generated the waste is fullyoperational. Therefore, the Agency believes that Bethlehem's waste waswell mixed and uniformly produced.Second, the commenter questioned how the limited laboratory-scale datasubmitted reflects day-to-day variations in the full-scale manufacturingand treatment processes, performance of equipment, reliability or qualityof reagent batches, or other factors, and how the laboratory data supportthe Agency's conclusion that the full-scale process will consistently generatenon-hazardous waste. The Agency, as stated above, believes that the sampleswere representative of the waste generated by production of the particulargrades of steel being produced by Bethlehem at that time. The Agency realizesthat data derived from a laboratory-scale treatment process demonstrateonly how well the laboratory-scale process works and only provide a generalindication of how well the full-scale process will perform. However, asthe Agency stated in the preamble, the purpose of the proposed verificationtesting requirements are to ensure that the full-scale treatment systemis capable of rendering the waste non-hazardous. See 53 FR 23662.Third, the commenter questioned Bethlehem's use of grab samples and statedthat grab samples are inconsistent with the recommended practice foundin both SW-846 and the ``Delisting Guidance Document.'' The Agency agreeswith the commenter that both SW-846 and the ``Delisting Guidance Document''recommend, depending on the nature and location of the wastestream, thatcomposite samples, consisting of either full-depth core samples or grabsamples collected over time, be collected and analyzed. However, in Bethlehem'scase and for the purposes of upfront delistings (where the petitioner istrying to demonstrate that a pilot- or laboratory-scale technology willbe successful in treating hazardous wastes), the Agency believes that grabsamples are adequate for providing samples of waste for laboratory-scaletesting. When the composition of a large volume wastestream remains relativelyconsistent on a daily basis, the Agency believes that grab samples of thiswaste, collected at a predetermined frequency, will yield results similarto those obtained from full-depth core samples. While grab samples maynot be as ``statistically'' representative as composite samples, grab sampleswill be more indicative of possible variations in waste composition fora given period of time.Fourth, the commenter questioned Bethlehem's selection of samples for analysisand noted that Bethlehem may have been picking the samples that yieldedthe best results. As stated above, the Agency inadvertently understatedthe number of samples Bethlehem collected, treated, and analyzed. Bethlehemconducted EP toxicity tests on a total of 123 uncured and fully-cured samplesof CSEAFD collected from both the Steelton and Johnstown facilities overnearly a two-year time period. The Agency notes that this number far exceedsthe minimum of four representative samples that petitioners are requiredto submit.The Agency has no way to confirm whether a petitioner is providing allthe results obtained from every analysis ever performed. However, the petitioneris legally bound by a certification statement to present accurate and representativeinformation/data. The Agency also notes that the petitioner's analyticaldata are subject to verification by an Agency spot-check sampling and verificationvisit. In addition, data obtained through laboratory- or pilot-scale operationswill be verified using data obtained through the initial verification testingperiod and subsequent verification testing. The Agency has no reason tobelieve that Bethlehem selected only its best data for submission.Fifth and finally, the commenter questioned how the Agency knows that Bethlehem'streatment equipment was properly operated and that the reagent was properlystored to ensure the stated results. The Agency believes that it was inBethlehem's best interest to ensure that its treatment process was properlyoperated and that its reagents were properly stored/handled. Had Bethlehemnot properly operated its treatment system or properly stored its reagents,the EAF dust may have exhibited higher EP and MEP leachate levels (sufficientlyhigh to fail the VHS model analysis). Thus, the Agency believes that theanalytical data characterizing the CSEAFD obtained from Bethlehem's laboratory-scaleprocess are a direct indication that Bethlehem properly operated its treatmentsystem and properly handled its reagents. The Agency has limited the proposedexclusion to cover the specific processes Bethlehem stated it intends touse. As discussed above, if Bethlehem significantly alters its treatmentprocess or operates it in a manner inconsistent with the treatment systemand manner of operation reported in the petition, the exclusion will notcover any wastes generated by the altered system.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conditional Testing and Reporting Requirements</ITAG>One commenter stated that if the Agency granted Bethlehem an exclusion,the conditional requirements of the exclusion should include analyses fortotal concentrations and MEP constituent concentrations of the hazardousconstituents.The Agency disagrees with the commenter. The Agency expects that this wastewill be disposed of in a municipal landfill, where soil conditions arelikely to be mildly acidic. EPA believes that the EP extraction procedureis the most appropriate analytical tool to evaluate the potential leachabilityof this waste in an acidic environment. For this waste, EPA believes thatcontinued evaluation of the EP leachable concentrations as required bythe conditions of this exclusion will be adequate to protect human healthand the environment. Furthermore, the Agency has not developed health-basedstandards regulating the total constituent concentrations of any of theEP toxic metals or nickel. To require Bethlehem to monitor continuallyfor the total constituent concentrations of all the EP toxic metals andnickel will not ensure further protection of human health or the environment.The Agency also does not believe it is necessary to require Bethlehem toperform continuous MEP analyses. First, the Agency's belief that the stabilizaitonprocess is effective is substantiated by the analytical data obtained fromthe previous MEP leachate tests. Additionally, if the stabilization processis ineffective and an increase in the leachability of the hazardous constituentsfrom the waste were to occur, the Agency believes that the EP leachateanalyses would measure such an increase.One commenter questioned why the Agency is proposing to allow Bethlehemto avoid all process control after merely four consecutive days of operation.The Agency believes that the commenter may have misinterpreted the preamblediscussion concerning the termination of the subsequent testing requriements.See 53 FR 23666 and 23669. First, Bethlehem will be required to collectrepresentative samples of every batch of CSEAFD generated during the initialfour weeks of full-scale operation. As the Agency discussed in the preamble,four weeks of initial verification testing will be sufficient to determinewhether the full-scale treatment system is capable of operating as reportedin the petition. Second, the proposed rule stipulated that, after the completionof the initial verification testing period, Bethlehem will continuallytest the CSEAFD until four consecutive batches meet the delisting levels.The Agency notes that, as a result of other comments received on the proposals,the subsequent testing conditions have been modified and the terminationof testing clauses have been removed. See below for a complete discussionof the other comments and modifications made to the testing and reportingrequirements. Furthermore, as in all delistings, the petitioner will berequired to operate the treatment process as demonstrated in the petitionand determine whether its waste exhibits the characteristics of a hazardouswaste (see 40 CFR 262.11).The commenter also questioned why the Agency was allowing the petitioner90 days to report the results of the initial daily testing required priorto disposal of the CSEAFD. The commenter believed that the data shouldbe reported immediately. The Agency disagrees with the commenter and believesthat it would be an unnecerssary burden to require the petitioner to providethe results of the daily analyses on a daily basis. The Agency believesthat reporting the data on a 90-day basis is reasonable and does not jeopardizehuman health and the environment.The commenter also questioned whether: (1) Bethlehem will report data fromtests of batches of CSEAFD that fail the conditional delisting levels;(2) Bethlehem will hold batches of CSEAFD that exceed the delisting levelsbeyond the 90-day storage limit allowed by RCRA for a hazardous waste;and (3) Bethlehem's treatment process will allow Bethlehem to remove materialfrom the landfill and reprocess CSEAFD that fails to meet conditional delistinglevels.Bethlehem will be required to report all data obtained from the initialtesting activities. Additionally, prior to Bethlehem's receipt of the initialverification testing results, Bethlehem must handle the CSEAFD as a hazardouswaste. Therefore, prior to analytical confirmation of the waste's meetingthe delisting levels, it will be subject to all of the applicable requirementsof Subtitle C and thus, Bethlehem will be subject to all applicable RCRAgenerator and storage requirements. Lastly, due to the nature of the CSEAFD(cement-like), the waste is in a form that facilitates subsequent movement;therefore, Bethlehem would be able to retrieve and/or reprocess the CSEAFDif necessary.The petitioner, Bethlehem Steel, objected to the Agency's verificationtesting conditions requiring the company, as part of both the initial testingand subsequent testing requirements, to analyze for the total constituentconcentrations of reactive sulfide and reactive cyanide and the EP leachateconcentration of cyanide. Bethlehem believed that the company had submittedsufficient data, which indicated non-detectable levels of reactive cyanide,reactive sulfide, and EP leachable cyanide, to support Bethlehem's contentionthat these three constituents were not present in either the raw dust orCSEAFD produced at both the Steelton and Johnstown facilities. Bethlehemrecommended that the proposed initial testing and subsequent testing requirementsto analyze for the total constituent concentrations of reactive sulfideand reactive cyanide and the EP leachate concentration of cyanide be deletedfrom the final verification testing conditions.Bethlehem also objected to the Agency's verification testing conditionsrequiring the company, as part of both the initial testing and subsequenttesting requirements, to analyze for the EP leachate concentrations ofarsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, and nickel. Bethlehem believed thatthe company had submitted sufficient data, which indicated non-detectablelevels of EP leachate arsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, and nickel, tosupport Bethlehem's contention that these five constituents are not presentat concentrations of concern in the CSEAFD produced at both the Steeltonand Johnstown facilities. Bethlehem asserted that the Agency was placingan undue analytical burden on the company by requiring analyses for constituentsthat the commenter believes are not present at concentrations of concernin the CSEAFD. Bethlehem recommended that the proposed initial testingand subsequent testing requirements to analyze for the EP leachate concentrationsof arsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, and nickel be modified. Bethlehemsuggested that for the initial testing condition, the frequency of analysesfor EP leachate concentrations of arsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, andnickel be reduced from daily to weekly, (<T3>i.e.,</T3> Bethlehem would still collect daily composite samples; however,the daily composite samples would be further mixed to produce one weeklycomposite sample). Bethlehem also suggested that the subsequent testingcondition, with respect to arsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, and nickelbe modified to require only four consecutive daily composite samples (<T3>i.e.,</T3> instead of testing every daily composite sample for theEP leachate concentrations of these five metals, Bethlehem would wait untilits process is operating correctly and then provide the results of fourconsecutive daily composites, thus reducing its total analytical burden).The Agency does not agree with the petitioner's claim that the verificationtesting conditions requiring analyses for total constituent concentrationsof reactive sulfide and reactive cyanide and EP leachate concentrationsof cyanide, arsenic, mercury, selenium, silver, and nickel are unduly burdensome.The Agency, when writing the verification conditions, attempted to limitthe analytical burden it was proposing to place on the petitioner whileensuring that only non-hazardous wastes were removed from Subtitle C control.The petitioner submitted data obtained from a laboratory-scale process.The Agency believes it prudent to verify that the treatment residue (inthis case, the CSEAFD) generated from the fully operational process actuallyis non-hazardous with respect to all potential constituents of concernwhich may reasonably expected to be found in the CSEAFD. Thus, the Agencybelieves that the proposed verification testing requirements for the totalconstituent concentrations of reactive sulfide and reactive cyanide andthe EP leachate concentrations of cyanide, arsenic, mercury, selenium,silver, and nickel are necessary and do not place a significant economicor analytical burden on the petitioner. Furthermore, only the initial verificationtesting (condition (1)(A)) requires analyses for total concentrations ofreactive cyanide and reactive sulfide.Bethlehem submitted information on the percentage of each type of scrapused to charge Bethlehem's furnaces on a month-by-month basis from January1986 through August 1988. Bethlehem stated that the percentage of eachtype of scrap charged in any given month varied due to a number of factors,including lack of availability of certain scrap types, changing scrap costs,and changing product metallurgical specifications. As Bethlehem correctlyconcluded, if the percentage of each different type of scrap metal usedby Bethlehem to charge the furnace falls outside of the percent range ofeach type of scrap metal historically used, Bethlehem would require a newexclusion and would have to handle their waste as hazardous until a newexclusion was granted. Bethlehem believed that it would be overly burdensometo require the company to submit a new petition each time the percentageof each type of scrap used to charge the furnace fell outside the historicalrange. Bethlehem, therefore, proposed that the company implement a ``feed-forward''system to monitor the effect of any significant change to the scrap chargeson the total constituent concentration of lead in the untreated EAF dustand/or EP leachate concentrations of cadmium, chromium, and lead in theCSEAFD.Specifically, Bethlehem suggested that prior to each month, Bethlehem wouldreview the percentage of high residuals-bearing scrap (<T3>i.e.,</T3> No. 2 heavy melting_regular auto scrap and No. 2 bundles_heavymelting scrap and light melting fragmentized auto scrap) that Bethlehemplans to consume in the forthcoming month to determine if the percentagewould be significantly greater than historical levels. (Bethlehem claimedthat the high residuals-bearing scrap is generally responsible for elevatedlevels of total lead in the EAF dust.) Bethlehem believed, based on a reviewof the percentages of each type of scrap used to charge the furnaces, thata planned monthly scrap charge containing more than 27.5 percent high residuals-bearingscrap would be significantly greater than historical levels. Bethlehemfurther stated, if the 27.5 percent threshold was to be exceeded, Bethlehemthen would institute a sampling and testing program that would providefor the collection of representative weekly composite samples of the unstabilizedEAF dust (prepared from daily grab samples of the dust) and daily compositesamples of the CSEAFD (prepared from grab samples of each batch of CSEAFDproduced) during the month in question. Each weekly composite sample ofEAF dust would be analyzed for lead. If such dust analyses show that thetotal constituent concentration of lead had significantly exceeded typicalmaximum levels (<T3>i.e.,</T3> greater than three percent) during any week, then four ofthe daily composite CSEAFD samples corresponding to that week (or weeks)would be tested for the EP toxicity concentrations of cadmium, chromium,and lead. Thus, if the EP levels were less than or equal to the delistinglevels, the CSEAFD process would be operating correctly and the waste couldbe considered non-hazardous. If, however, the EP levels exceeded the delistinglevels, then Bethlehem would be required either to retreat or to handlethe waste according to Subtitle C of RCRA. Following a successful verification(<T3>i.e.,</T3> four consecutive samples meeting the delisting levels),the threshold levels for triggering subsequent verification testing wouldbe raised by 1.0 percent for the high residuals-bearing scrap charge and0.1 percent for the lead in the unstabilized EAF dust above those levelsmeasured during the previous verification testing month.The Agency reviewed the information on the percentage of each type of scrapused to charge Bethlehem's furnaces on a month-by-month basis from January1986 through August 1988. The total monthly percentage of high residuals-bearingscrap consumed at the Steelton and Johnstown facilities varied from 2.2percent to 25.2 percent and 1.9 percent to 18 percent, respectively. TheAgency also reviewed the information previously submitted by Bethlehemon the percentage of each type of scrap used to charge its furnaces. However,the Agency was unable to directly compare the two sets of data since Bethlehem'sprevious data were not broken out according to the subcategories of lowresiduals-bearing and high residuals-bearing. Rather, the data were groupedby the larger categories of heavy melting and light melting scrap. Nevertheless,the Agency believes that the percentage composition of scrap has variedsince the submittal of Bethlehem's initial information on the percentagecomposition of scrap used to charge its furnaces. Additionally, the Agencyagrees with the petitioner and believes that the percentage of each typeof scrap charged in any given month will continue to vary depending ona number of factors, including lack of availability of certain scrap types,changing scrap costs, and changing product metallurgical specifications.The Agency also believes that requiring Bethlehem to submit a new petitionevery time the percentage of each type of scrap used to charge the furnacefell outside the historical range would be an unnecessary use of both theAgency's and Bethlehem's resources. Therefore, the Agency agrees with Bethlehemthat the proposed exclusion should be modified in order to accommodatethe variation in scrap used to charge the furnaces. However, the Agencydoes not believe that the Bethlehem's proposed ``feed-forward'' systemis feasible. The specifications of the Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel(ISIS) for grading scrap metal are voluntary guidelines. Therefore, potentiallysignificant variation in the specific type of scrap within a particularcategory (<T3>e.g., </T3>heavy melting, andplusmin;1 bundles, andplusmin;2 bundles) couldoccur. As a result, potentially significant variation in constituent concentrationscould occur without triggering verification testing (<T3>i.e., </T3>the concentrations of constituents could increase withoutinitiating the verification testing since the percentage of high residuals-bearingscrap did not change). Therefore, tracking the percentage of each typeof steel scrap, as classified using the ISIS grading system, would notprevent Bethlehem's waste from exhibiting variations in constituent concentrationsoutside of the range addressed by Bethlehem's petitions.Therefore, the Agency, in promulgating these final rules, has modifiedcondition (1)(B) to require Bethlehem to collect and analyze weekly compositesamples of the treated CSEAFD indefinitely:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1)(B) Subsequent Testing: Bethlehem must collect representative grabsamples from every treated batch of CSEAFD generated daily and compositeall of the grab samples to produce a weekly composite sample. Bethlehemthen must analyze each weekly composite sample for the EP leachate concentrationsof all the EP toxic metals and nickel. Analyses must be performed accordingto SW-846 methodologies. The analytical data, including all quality controldata, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of three years.These data must be furnished upon request and made available for inspectionby an employee or representative of EPA or the State of Pennsylvania.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Agency believes that it is necessary to require the petitionerto analyze weekly composites of the CSEAFD in order to ensure that thestabilization process effectively handles any potential variation in constituentconcentrations. As stated above, the potential variation in constituentconcentrations is a result of the potentially changing composition of thescrap charges. The Agency, however, believes that the composition of thescrap charges will not vary abruptly, i.e., from day-to-day. Rather, theAgency expects that the composition of the scrap charges will change graduallysince scrap generally, is not purchased every day. Therefore, the Agencybelieves that collecting composite samples on a weekly basis will be sufficientto ensure that the stabilization process is able to accommodate the potentialchanges in constituent concentrations and generate non-hazardous CSEAFD.The commercial availability of different types of scrap metal are subjectto change with time. Therefore, as described above, the Agency believesit is possible that the composition of the untreated EAF dust will varyover time. The Agency stated in the proposed rule, that future upfrontdelisting proposals and decisions may include different testing requirementsbased on an evaluation of the uniformity of the waste and that wastes withvariable constituent concentrations, including those discussed in previousdelisting decisions (<T3>e.g., </T3>51 FR 41323, November 14, 1986), would require continuousbatch testing. See 53 FR 23666 and 23669-23670, June 23, 1988. In thiscase, the Agency believes that the potential variations in waste composition(<T3>i.e., </T3>constituent concentrations) resulting from changing scrap,warrant the requirement for continual testing of weekly composite samplesof CSEAFD. As a result, the Agency removed condition (3) <T3>Termination of Testing </T3>in order to reflect the requirement forcontinual testing of weekly composite samples of the CSEAFD.The Agency is requiring the petitioner to compile and store on site, allanalytical data obtained through the subsequent testing condition (1)(B).The Agency realized that requiring the petitioner to submit these analyticaldata every six months would place an undue burden on both the petitionerand EPA. In addition, the Agency may at any time, either visit the facilityfor inspection purposes or request the petitioner to report these data.Therefore, the Agency is maintaining the same level of protection withoutrequiring the petitioner to report these analytical data every six months.Condition (4) <T3>Data submittals </T3>has been renumbered and now reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Data submittals: Within one week of system start-up, Bethlehemmust notify the Section Chief, Variances Section (see address below) whentheir full-scale stabilization system is on-line and waste treatment hasbegun.

At the Section Chief's request, Bethlehemmust submit analytical data obtained through condition (1)(B) to the aboveaddress, within the time period specified by the Section Chief. Failureto submit the required data obtained from either condition (1)(A) or (1)(B)within the specified time periods will be considered by the Agency sufficientbasis to revoke Bethlehem's exclusion to the extent directed by EPA. Alldata must be accompanied by the following certification statement:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Under civil and criminal penalty of law for the making or submissionof false or fraudulent statements or representations (pursuant to the applicableprovisions of the Federal Code which include, but may not be limited to,18 U.S.C. andSection; 6928), I certify that the information contained inor accompanying this document is true, accurate and complete.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As to the (those) identified section(s) of this document for whichI cannot personally verify its (their) truth and accuracy, I certify asthe company official having supervisory responsibility for the personswho, acting under my direct instructions, made the verification that thisinformation is true, accurate and complete.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA inits sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete, and upon conveyanceof this fact to the company, I recognize and agree that this exclusionof wastes will be void as if it never had effect or to the extent directedby EPA and that the company will be liable for any actions taken in contraventionof the company's RCRA and CERCLA obligations premised upon the company'sreliance on the void exclusion.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Name of Certifying Person)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">   Date</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Title of Certifying Person)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Certification Statement </ITAG>The petitioner, Bethlehem Steel, commented that the certification statementproposed for use in the data submittals for both the Steelton and Johnstownconditional exclusions is unnecessarily onerous and one-sided. Bethlehemalso believed that the provision by which signatories would ``recognizeand agree that this exclusion of wastes will be void as if it never hadeffect'' if any of the submitted ``information is determined by EPA inits sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete'' is tantamountto violating Bethlehem's right to due process. Bethlehem further assertedthat the proposed certification statement is inconsistent with that agreedto by EPA in its settlement agreement with industry petitioners in theconsolidated permit regulations litigation (<T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3> 673 F.2d 392 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 879(1982)). Bethlehem suggested, at a minimum, the proposed certificationlanguage be modified to include the following sentence:<ITAG tagnum="21">In making the above certification, Bethlehem Steel Corporation doesnot waive its right to seek judicial review of any action taken by EPApursuant to 42 USC 6976 or any other applicable provision of law.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Bethlehem recommended, however, that EPA use the previously agreedto and codified certification language (found at 40 CFR 122.22 and 270.11).The Agency disagrees with Bethlehem's assertion that the proposed certificationwould effectively violate Bethlehem's right of due process. Although thethrust of Bethlehem's concern is not entirely clear from the comments,apparently Bethlehem believed that EPA's ``determination'' that a certificationhad been false, inaccurate or incomplete would be judicially unreviewable.EPA intends no such result. In an appropriate enforcement or other administrative/judicialaction under RCRA or CERCLA with respect to wastes disposed of upon relianceon the allegedly void delisting, Bethlehem would not be precluded fromraising as a defense that the certification was, in fact, accurate, (andthus that no improper disposal had occurred). EPA will comport with dueprocess requirements in any administrative determination regarding thestatus of Bethlehem's delisting. For the same reasons, EPA does not believeit necessary or appropriate to include the sentence suggested by Bethlehem.EPA also does not agree that it must use the certification language usedfor NPDES and RCRA permit submissions adopted in settlement of the consolidatedpermits litigation. First of all, that language was agreed to in settlementof those consolidated cases only. EPA is not bound to follow that agreementwith respect to certification language found in any other rulemaking proceeding(including the present delisting). Furthermore, EPA does not believe thereis a material difference between the language found at 40 CFR 122.22 and270.11 and that in the proposed delisting (53 FR 23671). EPA notes thatthe issue in the consolidated permits litigation was over the previousrequirements that the certifying official personally examine and be familiarwith all information contained in the permit application being certified.The certification was changed to require only that the official have supervisedor directed the preparation of the permit application. See 48 FR 39613,April 1, 1983 for details. The proposed delisting certification also doesnot require personal examination of the conditional data prepared. Theproposed certification instead adds language relevant to the effect onthe status of the excluded waste if the information is, in fact, false.Thus, EPA believes that the certification proposed for this delisting andthe one found at andSection;122.22 are substantially the same and is todayfinalizing the certification as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">EPA's Modeling Approach </ITAG>Three commenters supported the Agency's use of the VHS model to evaluateBethlehem's waste; however, one commenter believed that the Agency shouldnot use a ``worst-case'' scenario when evaluating delisting petitions.The commenter believed that the worst-case scenario should only be usedas a first-stage screening tool and that failure resulting from a worst-case``screening'' scenario should not be used as a basis for denial, but, rather,the trigger for further evaluation. The commenter also believed that EPAshould have the flexibility to investigate the specific waste and site-specifichydrogeological conditions and to issue a conditional exclusion for disposalof the specific waste at a specific site. The Agency notes that it proposed to grant (and today finalizes) Bethlehem'spetitions utilizing the VHS model and incorporating a worst-case disposalscenario. As explained in the proposed rule, EPA believes that such anapproach is appropriate. See 53 FR 23662. Since the commenter's concernsregarding the use of ``worst-case'' scenarios do not affect the outcomeof these petitions, EPA does not address them in detail here. The use ofsite-specific factors in delisting evaluations is discussed in furtherdetail below. The same commenter stated that the vertical and horizontal spread (VHS)model is biased against large volume wastes (<T3>i.e.,</T3> 10,000-30,000 tons/year). The commenter believes that largevolume wastes are not likely to be disposed of in municipal landfills andthat the EP toxicity test, which is based on a municipal landfill scenario,yields concentrations of metals significantly higher than would actuallybe generated at a disposal facility. The commenter further believes that,because the VHS model does not recognize any attenuation or precipitationof metals and assumes that large volumes of wastes always result in greaterconcentrations of a constituent in an aquifer, large volume wastes arevirtually precluded from delisting. As the Agency previously stated, it was not the Agency's intention to createa bias against large volumes of hazardous waste. See 50 FR 48907, November27, 1986. The Agency recognizes, however, that large sources of waste whichleach a contaminant at a particular level will have a greater impact onan underlying aquifer than a small amount of waste leaching at the same(or even higher) level. The Agency contends that, as waste volume increases,hazard potential also increase. Thus, the approach is justly weighted againstlarge-volume wastes. The Agency also disagrees with the commenter's claim that large volumesof waste are virtually precluded from delisting. Specifically, the Agencyhas recently granted an exclusion for a petitioner generating nearly 16,000tons/year. See 54 FR 11706, March 22, 1989. Additionally, Bethlehem's Steeltonand Johnstown facilities will be producing 57,000 tons/year and 87,900tons/year, respectively of wastes which are delisted today. Lastly, the same commenter believed that EPA, due to the large number ofanalytical data points characterizing the EP and MEP leachate levels forthe EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide, should have evaluated the 95percent upper confidence levels (UCLs) instead of the maximum EP or MEPleachate levels in the VHS model. The commenter further stated that theuse of 95 percent UCLs to conservatively evaluate large data bases is consistentwith standard statistical practice, as well as EPA policy, found in SW-846,for evaluating wastes/delisting petitions. The Agency agrees with the commenter that it may be appropriate to useUCLs when statistically evaluating large populations of analytical data.However, in this case, the Agency chose to use maximum EP and MEP leachatelevels when evaluating Bethlehem's petitions because the Agency does notbelieve that a sufficient number of analyses were available for all ofthe metals in the uncured and cured state. For example, only five samplesof uncured wastes were analyzed for EP leachate levels of barium. In anycase, EPA notes that the petitioned wastes passed the VHS modeling analysiswhen the maximum EP/MEP leachate levels were used. The Agency may electto consider the use of either the average constituent level or UCL whenthe maximum constituent level is of concern and the sample population issufficiently large. A second commenter also supported EPA's proposed use of the VHS model asapplied to Bethlehem's petitioned waste, and strongly supported EPA's assertionthat ``it is inappropriate for the Delisting Program to consider extensivesite-specific factors in its evaluation of delisting petitions.'' See 53FR 23662. The commenter believed that it is unlawful and inappropriatefor EPA to consider any site-specific factors in its evaluation of delistingpetitions. This comment does not pertain to this petition nor does it affectthe proposed decision since the Agency did not consider any site-specificfactors in its evaluation of the petitioned waste. The Agency, therefore,will independently respond to this comment in the context of a separaterulemaking petition raising this issue with the agency (filed by the HazardousWaste Treatment Council).<ITAG tagnum="81">Inconsistencies Between the Delisting Program and the Land DisposalRestrictions Program</ITAG>One commenter believed that there are inconsistencies between delistinglevels proposed for Bethlehem and the Land Disposal Restrictions Program'sproposed best demonstrated available technology (BDAT) treatment levelsfor K061 wastes. See 53 FR 23665 and 23669, June 23, 1988 and 53 FR 11742,April 8, 1988, respectively. (On August 17, 1988, the Agency promulgatedBDAT treatment levels for K061 non-wastewater wastes. See 53 FR 31138).Specifically, the commenter believed that for cadmium, chromium, lead,and mercury, either the total constituent concentration or the leachableconstituent levels of Bethlehem's CSEAFD substantially exceed the BDATtreatment standards that EPA had proposed for K061 waste.The Agency agrees with the commenters that there are differences in approachbetween some of the decision criteria used in individual delisting decisionsand those used in the Land Disposal Restrictions Program (LDRP). However,these differences are appropriate given the separate functions of the twoprograms and their different statutory bases. The Delisting Program andthe LDRP are fundamentally different in that the Delisting Program's standardsare health-based and the LDRP's treatment standards are technology-based.See RCRA Section 3001 (42 U.S.C. 6921) and RCRA Section 3004 (42 U.S.C.6924(m)), respectively. The Agency, however, believes that both the health-basedand technology-based approaches of the Delisting Program and the LDRP,respectively, are protective of human health and the environment.3. Final Agency DecisionFor the reasons stated in the proposal, the Agency believes that Bethlehem'sCSEAFD, when subject to the verification testing requirements specifiedin the exclusion, should be excluded from hazardous waste control. TheAgency, therefore, is granting a final conditional exclusion to BethlehemSteel Company, for its facilities located in Steelton, Pennsylvania, andJohnstown, Pennsylvania, for both its uncured and fully-cured chemicallystabilized electric arc furnace dust treatment residue, described in thepetitions as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061. The exclusion applies only tothe processes covered by the original demonstration. The facilities wouldrequire a new exclusion if either the manufacturing or treatment processesare significantly altered such that an adverse change in waste compositionoccurred. Accordingly, the facilities would need to file new petitionsfor the altered wastes. The facilities must treat wastes generated fromchanged processes as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.Although management of the waste covered by this petition is relieved fromSubtitle C jurisdiction, the generator of a delisted waste must eithertreat, store, or dispose of the waste in an on-site facility, or ensurethat the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposalfacility, either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a Stateto manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively, the delistedwaste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or reuses,or legitimately recycles or reclaims the waste, or treats the waste priorto such beneficial use, reuse, recycling, or reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Limited Effect of Federal Exclusion</ITAG>The final exclusion being granted today is being issued under the Federal(RCRA) delisting program. States, however, are allowed to impose theirown, non-RCRA regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA's,pursuant to andSection; 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements mayinclude a provision which prohibits a Federally-issued exclusion from takingeffect in the State. Since a petitioner's waste may be regulated undera dual system (<T3>i.e., </T3>both Federal (RCRA) and State (non-RCRA) programs), petitionersare urged to contact their State regulatory authority to determine thecurrent status of their wastes under State law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended Section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here becausethis rule reduces, rather than increases, the existing requirements forpersons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardshipand expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective datesix months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadline isnot necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis rule should be effective immediately upon promulgation. These reasonsalso provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation,under the Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This rule to grant exclusions is not major since its effect is to reducethe overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste managmentregulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding wastes generated attwo facilities from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling thefacilities to treat their wastes as non-hazardous. There is no additionaleconomic impact, therefore, due to today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and smallgovernmental jurisdictions). The Administrator or delegated representativemay certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.This amendment will not have an adverse economic impact on small entitiessince its effect will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardouswaste regulations and is limited to two facilities. Accordingly, I herebycertify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisfinal rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
