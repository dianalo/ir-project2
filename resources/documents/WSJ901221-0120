The embattled utility's plan was unanimously approved bythe Securities and Exchange Commission, which has partialcontrol over the accord because Northeast is a holdingcompany for utilities and must register with the agency.</LP><TEXT>   The transaction, which required nine federal and stateregulatory clearances, also received the conditional blessingyesterday of an administrative law judge at the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission. The acquisition now requiresthe energy commission's approval.   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., hasapproved the accord, but that decision is being appealed. TheNuclear Regulatory Commission also needs to allow thetransfer of the license for the Seabrook Nuclear PowerProject to Northeast, Hartford, Conn. Still standing in theway of the deal is the final permission of several states,including New Hampshire, a state in which a rate increaserecently was approved and is being appealed.   Despite those remaining hurdles, yesterday's actions are aboost for PS New Hampshire, which filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection in January 1988 after drowning in debt related toits 35.6% holding in the controversial Seabrook plant.Northeast then proposed to buy the Manchester utility for$2.3 billion, setting the regulatory steps in motion.   In examining the proposed acquisition, the SEC stafflooked at the financing of the accord, the schedule of rateincreases, the proposed savings to the utilities of combiningtheir overhead, and how the move would change theconcentration of electric-power generation in New England.The commission followed the staff recommendation to approvethe deal.   In doing so, the agency rejected a proposal by severalintervenors to hold a hearing on the plan at the SEC, saidWilliam Weeden, the SEC official most closely involved in theproposal. He said their objections centered on whether theacquisition by Northeast would create a near monopoly forelectric power in the region.   Separately, the SEC voted to put out for public comment aproposal designed to help overseas underwriters makeofferings in the U.S. The plan, already in place for U.S.underwriters, would allow the overseas underwriting firmmaking an offering in the U.S. to support the stock price.   &quot;The commission has always recognized that as a form ofmanipulation, but a form of manipulation that is needed,&quot;said Larry Bergmann, the agency's associate director formarket regulation. He said that the SEC has been givingexemptions for these &quot;stabilizations&quot; to foreign underwritersbut that the agency is looking to &quot;codify&quot; those exemptions.</TEXT></DOC>
