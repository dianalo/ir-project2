 Coming to the rescue are imaging software packages that can scan inall these documents and store them electronically.andP;  Arco Oil and Gas has twoViewStar image servers.andP;  Built around Gupta Technologies' SQLLBase engine,ViewStar Stores a database of document images.andM;Despite the fact that LANs are taking over the business world there are veryfew LAN-specific applications to take advantage of distributed processing.andO;There are plenty of LAN-compatible applications but these are no more thansuccessful standalone packages which were modified to run on a LAN.andO;Primarily, these apPlications let people share files and printers.andP;  TheseLAN-compatible applications do not accommodate several users working on thesame thing.andM;On the other hand, a LAN-intrinsic application is architected according tothe structure of a LAN.andP;  It takes advantage of the distributed resources of anetwork in such a way that there can be no standalone counterpart.andM;There are some LAN-based software packages, of course.andP;  Group editingsoftware, like docuForum from Marae GroupWare  Ann Arbor, MI) or ForCommentfrom Broderbund Software (San Rafael, CA), allows several users to write andrewrite the, same document.andP;  Remote control software like R2LAN fromCrosstalk Communications (Roswell, GA) will let a use remote PC even if theconnection is over a LAN cable, not a phone line.andP;  It's not really aLAN-specific application.andP;  it's really just creative use of an ordinary,standalone application.andM;One of the few true LAN applications out there is ViewStar from the eponymousEmeryville, CA-based company Without a network, ViewStar could not exist.andO;More specifically, without the client-server architecture inherentlyavailable in a network, ViewStar could not exist.andP;  Imaging software designedto automate any paper-based process in an office, ViewStar scans documentsand stores them in SOLBase, a Structured Query Language  SQL) database enginefrom Gupta Technologies (Menlo Park, CA).andP;  Once in the ViewStar system, usersanywhere can retrieve and modify these documents.andM;The idea behind ViewStar is that anything that can be done with a physicalpiece of paper can be done electronically.andP;  For example, when a bank receivesa loan application, it is put in a file folder and then routed to a number ofpeople to be processed.andP;  With ViewStar, the bank would simply scan theapplication.andP;  Then, based on rules set up by the system administrator, anynumber of people could view the application and make notes on the applicationitself.andP;  The same could happen with a CAD drawing that a design group wouldforward to the purchasing department where the purchasing agents could makechanges and return the drawing.andM;ViewStar is not just another standalone product modified to run over network.andO;it's based on a distributed vices architecture, running a piece on the users'workstations and back-end on a database server.andP;  ViewStar is just one of thethird-party front ends available for SOLBase.andM;Most LAN software is based on the file server model.andP;  The applicationprogram, say a database, sits on the file server.andP;  When a user wants to loadthe database, the file server sends the entire program to the workstation.andO;When the user makes a query, the file server sends chunks of the databasedata to the workstation.andP;  The workstation must search through the data torecords which fulfill the query.andM;ViewStar and SQLBase follow the client-server model.andP;  The guts of thedatabase sit on the database server, which in most cases is distinct from thefile server.andP;  Each workstation has a different piece of software which is thefront end.andP;  The front end is primarily responsible for requesting andpresenting data.andP;  When the user queries the database, the database serverprocesses the request and sends only the appropriate data to the user.andO;Traffic on the LAN is significantly reduced.andP;  Additionally, only the serverneeds to be a very powerful machine; the users may have ATs without a largeRAM cache.andM;ViewStar uses standard platforms and runs on a 286, 386 or PS/2 and on anyNetBIOS-compatible network.andP;  Since it is purely software, the users may runany other software, such as Lotus 1-2-3, without conflicts.andP;  ViewStarrequires a database server separate from the file server, but otherapplication servers can be integrated into the file server.andP;  AlthoughViewStar can use any method of storage, the company recommends an opticaldisk jukebox because of the large storage requirements that characterizeimage storage.andP;  An optical disk jukebox is modelled after the old-fashionedjukebox.andP;  The optical disks are stacked up inside a large cabinet, and can beflipped around until the appropriate one can be accessed.andM;ViewStar documents are all &quot;intelligent,&quot; with embedded information abouttheir creation, interrelationships to other documents and rules about who canview them.andP;  Like paper documents, several ViewStar documents can be placed inan electronic folder.andP;  Unlike paper, ViewStar documents can be put in thisfolder regardless of their location in the database.andP;  They can also beelectronically linked or &quot;paper-clipped&quot; together and sent collectively toother users.andM;Modular DesignandM;The VS*Star is the system software module for ViewStar.andP;  it sits between theuser's front end and the SQLBase back end, allowing users to access documentstransparently, so that they don't have to learn a whole new set of commands.andO;VS*Star is an expert systems shell that controls document storage andretrieval.andP;  The product also comes with an application developer's toolkit,VS * Developer that allows programmers to customize the databases to a user'sspecific needs.andM;The system administrator toolkit, called VS*Admin allows the network managerto set up databases, monitor the system and to control the messaging system.andO;There are four modules in the toolkit.andP;  With the Model module, theadministrator can set up the database, define its relationship to otherdatabases and data in the system.andP;  Database models can be hierarchical,network or hybrid.andP;  Users must directly define the relationships betweenrecords for both network and the hybrid model databases.andP;  A hierarchicaldatabase is structured as a tree.andP;  And while a network model database may usea tree format, the relationships among records more often are a nexus ofconnections.andP;  The databases can be used for basic storage of scanneddocuments, or can be set up to perform more complex transaction-orientedprocessing.andM;With the Security module, the manager can define which user or group of userscan view a document, which application individual users can access, and howthey can manipulate various documents.andP;  For example, the original designer ofa CAD drawing may be the only one in an engineering group to be able tomodify a document, with the other engineers assigned read-only privileges.andM;Basic system administration like configuration and monitoring can beaccomplished with the Admin module.andP;  Administrators can assign and managesystem devices, like an optical disk jukebox.andP;  They can also collectstatistics on system usage, and backup the databases.andM;ViewStar also provides an E-mail system, controlled by the Express module.andO;Users can send messages, documents, markups (modifications to documents),comments,  linked documents and even operating procedures to other users.andO;Those other users can be located on the local ViewStar system or on a remoteLAN connected through a wide area network.andP;  All the security controls remainconsistent no matter where the document is sent.andM;Application DevelopmentandM;ViewStar comes with an application developers' toolkit, VS*Developer.andO;VS*Developer's main component is VS * Script, a fourth-generationobject-oriented programming language.andP;  It gives developers program-levelaccess to every menu, dialog, icon, command and function within ViewStar.andO;Scripts can be developed to either run at the user's invocation or to runautomatically when a user logs in.andM;ViewStar is using VS * Developer to build a set of applications to automatecommonly needed functions for users.andP;  its first application is DataScan, asystem for the most basic function in the ViewStar process, scanning indocuments.andP;  Aside from the obvious scan, re-scan and quality controlfunctions, DataScan includes a Quick Build installation function that makesinitially configuring the system easier.andP;  Workstation SoftwareandM;There is a whole other series of modules for use at the workstation level.andO;The great majority of users are not concerned with setting up a database ordeveloping applications.andP;  They're mainly concerned with viewing and modifyingdocuments and need everything to be as transparent as possible.andP;  With VS *Workbench installed on a workstation, users can manipulate the document totheir heart's content.andP;  Two additional modules, VS*Import and VS*Markup,further extend the capabilities of VS*Workbench.andM;Users can view any number of documents concurrently.andP;  ViewStar requires ahigh-end workstation, complete with a mouse.andP;  There is a MicrosoftWindows-basedandM;version  called VS * Retrieve that runs on a bare-bones PC.andP;  It allows usersto find, view or print documents.andP;  The windows can be any size the user needsand can be overlapped as well.andP;  When a document is called up, any documentthat has been linked to it is also displayed automatically.andP;  Using either amouse or a keyboard, the user can pan or zoom a document.andP;  VS*Import allowsdocuments which were scanned to become part of the database.andM;Users who need to modify documents can extend their capabilities with VS *Markup and VS * MarkupPlus.andP;  Direct modifications, such as scribbles orgraphic changes and text can be made directly to the document, or commentscan be inserted.andP;  These markups and comments can be organized into differentlayers.andP;  For example, all the changes made by the Purchasing group could beclassified separately from those made by Accounting.andM;ViewStar At ArcoandM;Arco Oil and Gas uses ViewStar to store and manage its mass of geologicaldata and land contracts, not just over a local area network, but over a widearea network.andP;  The Texas-based oil and gas exploration company isheadquartered in Dallas and has district offices in Midland, Lafayette,Houston, Plano and Bakerfield.andP;  Arco acquired its first network about fiveyears ago.andP;  Since then, Arco has been installing departmental LANs, accordingto Greg Zwick, senior consultant in information Services at Arco.andP;  Arco hasnow started to integrate the departmental networks into a company-widenetwork.andM;Since the LANs were first installed with only workgroups in mind, Arco haswide variety of networking equipment.andP;  There are 32 Novell NetWare fileservers on both Ethernet and Token Ring networks, with about 15 users perserver.andM;They also have about 500 Macintosh users on an AppleTalk network.andP;  TheAppleTalk network is bridged to the PC LAN using NetWare 2.15, plus NetWarefor Macintosh.andM;Actually, Arco has two separate ViewStar systems, one for its LandOrganization and the other for its Exploration Data Processing Group.andP;  TheLand Organization is in the process of scanning all its documents into theViewStar database, storing them on optical disk.andP;  The workstation with theattached scanner and the ViewStar database server are on a Token Ring networkin Dallas.andP;  However, the optical disk server sits on an Ethernet network.andO;The Token Ring and Ethernet LANs are joined via a Novell operating-systemlevel gateway.andM;To connect the district off ices back to Dallas, Arco uses TransLANs, remoteMAC-layer bridges from Vitalink Communications (Fremont, CA) and56K-bitsper-second leased lines.andP;  While the majority of WANs installed use56K-bits-per-second or slower leased lines, when transmitting images, leasedlines provide meagre bandwidth.andP;  According to Zwick, Arco is planning toupgrade to a 1.544M-bits-per-second T-1 line.andP;  He estimates that with the T-1line, it will take between 25 and 30 seconds from the time the user requeststhe document to the time he or she can view the first page.andP;  Land contractsaverage about 60 pages, which makes the average file size about 62K bytes.andM;When users at any of the district offices request a document, they access theSQLBase database server which actually resides in Dallas.andP;  The connection istransparent, except for the slower response time.andP;  The document is thenretrieved off the optical disk and moved over the LAN to the TransLAN bridge.andO;From there is sent over the leased line to the file server in the local office.andP;  The user can then view the land contract which resides in the fileserver's cache.andM;The Exploration Data Processing Group, located in Plano, uses a separateViewStar system for scanning in seismic documentation.andP;  The data is will thenbe used to evaluate drilling sites.andP;  The Exploration Data Processing Grouphas an estimated four to five million pages of data that they need tocapture.andP;  The system is run primarily over Ethernet, with some users able toaccess it from Token Ring networks, using a Novell gateway.andP;  However, for nowthey're primarily involved in scanning the masses of documentation into thesystem.andM;The two ViewStar systems are tied together on the same network so physicallyand logically the users of the two groups could access each other'sinformation.andP;  In reality, the Land Organization and the Exploration DataProcessing Group have no reason to exchange information.andP;  However, Arco plansto acquire an optical disk jukebox sometime in the fourth quarter of 1989 forboth systems to share.andP;  For now, each system has separate optical diskservers.andM;Although the database of images is stored on optical disk, an index of thedocuments that have been scanned is kept on an IBM mainframe.andP;  The host canbe accessed from a 3270 gateway in Plano, or from one of several LANsattached directly to IBM cluster controllers, which in turn are connected tothe mainframe.andM;ViewStar is the only imaging system that Arco uses, but, of course they haveplenty of other applications running over their network.andP;  For example, theyuse NetRemote from Brightwork Development (Red Bank, NJ) for dial-in.andO;NetRemote allows remote users to dial into a LAN and act as if they wereusing their PCs locally.andP;  Although many of their users do take advantage ofdial-in capabilities for other applications, ViewStar is generally not runover NetRemote because of the sheer volume of data that needs to be shipped.andM;NetWare is used for regular file security, but ViewStar has its own security.andO;All the users security profiles are maintained on SOLBase.andP;  Users log in withtheir name and password.andP;  When the system administrator sets up each documenthe or she can specify up to 10 levels of security that users have tocircumvent before they can view the document.andP;  In addition, the administratorcreates user profiles that specify what security level any given person canclear for different functions.andM;Most of the user training is done by Zwick and he confesses that he hopes toget other people involved in training.andP;  Each departmental network has a localperson to take care of training.andP;  They're trying to centralize server supportand expand services to their user base.andP;  ViewStar conducted a class to getusers started when they set up the system, but Zwick has noticed a realdemand for information on imaging.andP;  They're considering expanding training onthe system.andM;ViewStar's extensive capability doesn't come cheaply.andP;  Arco's initialconfiguration cost  80,000 at each of the two sites.andP;  Future plannedexpansions include the optical disk jukebox, 10 more workstations and fivemore scanners.andP;  Budgeting also includes 18,000 more documents that thecontractors plan to scan.andP;  All of this will cost about  500,000.andP;  Don't bedeceived, though: Arco was spending six million to manage its paper-baseddocuments.andM;Arco is also looking into acquiring ViewStar systems for other groups withinthe corporation.andP;  Future possible candidates include groups in Purchasing,Materials, Revenue and Accounting, Natural Gas and Marketing.andP;  LAandM;CORRECTIONandM;In the integrated Software article in our August issue we incorrectly saidthat Enable Software (Ballston, NY) had integrated the products of ConeticSystems (San Leandro, CA) into their line of integrated software.andP;  ConeticSystems' Higgins remains a standalone product, although Enable has boughtConetic.andP;  in addition to its electronic mail features, Higgins includes agroup scheduler.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
