MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Proceeding with caution despite Chineserepression, President Bush is determined not to tear down bridges toBeijing, believing that ties with the United States, though shaken,may yet be the path to greater economic and political freedom.   He's been facing political pressure for a more forceful U.S.policy since the days before the crackdown and massacre in TiananmenSquare, but he has resisted demands for tougher sanctions.   That's based on practical judgment as well as philosophy. There'slittle chance that the Chinese government would change itsrepressive course because of them.   Bush's China course fits his broader view of the way the UnitedStates should deal with economic and political change in theCommunist world. He is doing so with care, wary of over-reactionthat could court trouble.   Bush is applying that guideline as he journeys to Poland andHungary beginning on Sunday.   ``It is important the United States show its interest in thesecountries that are undergoing change,'' Bush said last week. ``Youdon't want to overexhort. You don't want to overpromise. You don'twant to rally people to levels of political activity that mightcause repression.''   In an interview with three Polish journalists, Bush repeatedlystressed that concern. He said he would not seek to inflame, wouldnot do anything that could provoke crisis.   When students seeking democratic reforms in China first occupiedTiananmen Square, Bush resisted demands that he speak out forcefullyin behalf of their demonstrations as well as their goals. But hesaid on May 22 that beyond urging the students to peacefully standup for their beliefs, he was not going to try to tell them what todo. Bush also urged the Chinese government to seek a peacefulresolution that would further democracy.   The president said he did not want to exhort the students ``in away that is going to stir up a military confrontation.''   When confrontation came, in the bloody crackdown of June 3, Bushcondemned it, cut off sales of military equipment, barred privatearms sales, barred military and other high-level visits, suspendedU.S. support of international bank loans to China, and left open thepossibility of further steps.   He stopped short of trade sanctions or a break in diplomaticrelations.   The Chinese government protested those measures as interferencein domestic affairs, but apparently continues to cooperate in U.S.intelligence-gathering from missile and nuclear monitoring sitesnear the Soviet border.   While the administration has not been explicit about that, Bushhas said that any president must be concerned about the strategicimportance of U.S. relations with China.   Bush said he will continue to express outrage about the attackthat ended the demonstrations, and the executions that havefollowed. ``But I reiterate also my desire not to do damage to thepeople themselves, because I believe that it was contact with theUnited States and others in the West that moved the process ofeconomic reform forward and hopefully, some day will move theprocess of political reform forward,'' he said.   That has not satisfied Congress. Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, said the president should speak more forcefullyabout Chinese executions, ``which can only be described as organizedmurder _ terror by a government against its own people, seeking tointimidate them.''   The House voted unanimously on June 29 to toughen U.S. sanctionsagainst China. An amendment to a foreign aid bill would put into lawthe steps Bush took, and add suspension of trade and developmentprograms, a ban on sale of police equipment, and a bar againsttransfer of nuclear aterials that might have military application.   The vote was 418-0, but it probably doesn't mean much. The billwas sent to the Senate, which hasn't started work on the subject. Soit is far from enactment, although it did send a message.   ``I think someone in this government ... has to speak clearly onbehalf of the American people and take more forceful action than thepresident and the secretary of state have been to date willing totake,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Rep.William Broomfield, R-Mich., said ``the Chinese should be aware thatthere is a deep-seated revulsion in Congress to what they havedone.''   But Bush, who spent 16 months as U.S. representative to China in1974 and 1975, noted after the crackdown that the Chinesehistorically have been ``less than totally interested in what othercountries think of their performance.''   Richard M. Nixon, who as president opened U.S. relations withChina, said a policy of reprisal would only isolate the Chineseregime.   ``Lashing back with punitive policies would be politicallypopular and emotionally satisfying for the great majority of theAmerican people,'' he said. ``Such policies would make us feelbetter.''   But he said they wouldn't have any impact on the hard-liners whohold power in China.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
