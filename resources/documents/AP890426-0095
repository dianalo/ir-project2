Post on the USS Iowa explosion:   In all, 47 sailors died in the horrible explosion aboard the USSIowa. Families, friends and all of us who relied on those men toguard our seas want to know why they died.   Was it because the Navy insists on maintaining a needlesslydangerous and outdated weapons system? It is a question thatdeserves careful study.   The Navy already has jumped to the defense of its battleshipsand its enormous 16-inch guns. ... This is not the time for thattype of defensive thinking.   Instead, the Navy should thoroughly examine the reasons for theexplosion inside the World War II-vintage gun turret.   Then, the Navy must realistically determine whether this is thebest and safest technology available to its fighting men.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 21   The Daily World, Aberdeen, Wash., on the USS Iowa explosion:   The explosion that killed 47 men aboard the battleship Iowa wasa tragic reminder of the risk that goes with military service, arisk often not fully appreciated by the American public. ...   The accident has revived some of the criticism expressed severalyears ago when the government reactivated four old World War II``battlewagons.'' ...   After the Iowa explosion (April 19), one critic was prominentlydisplayed on television complaining about the ship's``old-fashioned ammunition, old-fashioned technology andold-fashioned wiring.''   Despite the criticism, the recommissioned battleships serve manymilitary purposes. They have been outfitted with the latestcommunications and electronic warfare equipment and each has beenequipped with deadly Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles. ...   To suggest, as some have, that the battleships should now bere-mothballed is like saying that the frigate fleet should bescrapped because the USS Stark, while on patrol in the Persian Gulfin 1987, suffered many casualties when it was hit and nearly sunkby a missile fired by an Iraqi warplane.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 22   San Gabriel Valley (Calif.) Tribune on foreign oil reliance:   The spring surge in gasoline cost has boosted pump prices inCalifornia by up to 30 cents a gallon. ...   Not surprisingly, the Alaskan oil spill coupled with theunvarnished greed of major American oil companies were all it tookto send gas prices soaring.   Yet even before the disaster in Prince William Sound, crude oilprices had been rising steadily for several months as theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and otherforeign producers gained greater control over the world market.   Today, in fact, the United States is potentially far morevulnerable to price manipulation by the OPEC cartel than in 1973,when the first oil shock dealt a body blow to the economies of theindustrialized democracies.   During the 1970s, this country relied on imported oil for aboutone-third of its total consumption. After seven years of decliningdomestic production amid sharply rising fuel use, the United Statesnow depends on foreign sources for half of its petroleum needs.   During 1988, exploration and drilling by the U.S. oil industrydeclined to their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1940....   If fuel costs continue to mount, higher inflation willinevitably hasten a recession in this country and probably on aglobal scale as well.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 23   Huron (S.D.) Daily Plainsman on House Speaker James Wright:   It would appear that House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas is in aheap of trouble. ...   In light of the recent charges, we do not believe that Wrightcan function effectively in his role as Speaker of the House. Itwould be best if he would step down from that position. ...   Wright represents Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. Itwill be up to those voters as to whether or not he remains in theHouse. ...   The president already has been told by the U.S. Senate that hisfirst nominee for secretary of defense, John Tower, also of Texas,was ethically unsuited for the job.   Unfortunately, Bush and Tower didn't withdraw voluntarily. Itwas put to a vote and the president lost.   It would appear to us that until the investigation is completed,Wright should step down as Speaker of the House.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 24   San Antonio Express-News on welfare reform:   While some in Congress might think the welfare reforms theyenacted last year were sufficient, the Congressional Budget Office,or CBO, has produced a detailed study of that complcated packagethat makes it clear that it was reform in name only.   The lawmakers who pushed through the Family Support Act of 1988boasted that it would pay for itself by moving low-income familiesoff the welfare rolls and into productive employment.   But the CBO now calculates that the measure will actually end upincreasing the number of families on welfare. The total packagewill cost billions above current welfare costs.   That would be OK if the result were to rescue poor people fromthe welfare trap. Instead, Washington's continued resistance togenuine reform will cause even more dependency.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
