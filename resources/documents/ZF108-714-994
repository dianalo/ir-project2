(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WHY CASE SHOULD EXTEND INTO SOFTWARE PERFORMANCEandM;As the leader of one of your organization's systems development groups, youhave just been given an especially difficult assignment.andP;  It seems that allprojects have tight deadlines, but this one has some special problems.andP;  Theapplication is unusually large and response time is critical.andP;  If the systemcannot meet its performance goals, it will have to be scrapped.andM;The members of your group begin by browsing through the library of domainmodels that have been accumulated since your reuse program began in earnestseveral years ago.andP;  The hypertext browsing system locates several modelfragments that may help to construct a specification of the new product.andM;An online conference determines what problems will arise in integrating thesemodels and identifies parts of the application for which no models exist.andO;Integrated conferencing software displays the graphical models to each teammember on a high-resolution workstation.andP;  The team identifies and resolvesissues, and the contents of the conference are captured for latter use in thedocumenting system.andM;You assign tasks to members of the group.andP;  The process management systemcaptures this information for latter use in tracking the project.andM;Once the new model fragments are constructed and all the parts areintegrated, the specification is ready for review.andP;  You schedule a reviewwith the end users.andP;  Since the models are captured in a formal graphicallanguage, they are &quot;executable.&quot;andP;  A similation of the product's behavior ispresented using an analysis/design toolkit that provides graphical animation.andO;The users identify some minor changes in requirements based on the simulationand you make a note to incorporate them into the specification.andM;Before beginning design, members of your team do a rough analysis of theperformance of the proposed system.andP;  A performance engineering tool parsesthe specification model and constructs a performance model.andP;  There are stillmany details to be resolved in design and implementation, but this high-levelanalysis identifies some areas of risk.andP;  You assign one developer toinvestigate these areas more closely, possibly via a prototype.andM;The target environment is a distributed system, and several ways to partitionthe design appear to be possible.andP;  Analysts construct design modelsrepresenting the alternatives using the analysis/design toolkit and pass theresults to the performance engineering tool.andP;  With more information available(including task structure and processor allocations), the results of theperformance analysis are more detailed.andP;  As a result, additional areas ofrisk are identified.andM;Ultimately, developers select a design capable of producing the requiredperformance using a significant number of components from your reuse library.andO;Code for some of the new components can be automatically generated from thedesign models.andP;  Other components must be hand coded to meet performancerequirements.andP;  As the code is produced, its performance is measured andnecessary changes are made.andM;After testing (also supported by automated tools), the application isdelivered to the end users.andP;  They are delighted with both its functionalityand its performance.andP;  Was it delivered on time?andP;  Well, since this is clearlya fictional scenario, why not?andM;The scenario described here, and the development environment that supports,it, are obviously fictional, but all of the required capabilities exist.andO;Some are research prototypes, many years from production quality; others arecommercial products available in today's computer-aided software engineering(Case) market.andM;The major barrier to more effective software engineering today is not a lackof automated (Case) tools to support development tasks.andP;  While toolcapabilities will continue to expand and new tools will appear, the principalproblem to be solved is integration of methods and tools across the softwaredevelopment cycle.andM;In the scenario, software analysis and design techniques were fullyintegrated with performance engineering techniques.andP;  The specification anddesign models, produced with Case analysis and design tools, provide inputfor performance engineering tools.andP;  The results of the performance studiesprovided feedback that was used to modify the design and identify possibleareas of risk.andP;  The result was a product that met both its functional andperformance requirements while preserving a coherent, well-documented design.andM;To realize the benefits suggested by this scenario, automated support foranalysis/design (i.e., Case) must be tightly integrated with automatedsupport for performance engineering.andP;  Yet, current analysis/design tools arepoorly integrated with software performance engineering (SPE) tools, if atall.andM;Computer-aided software (or systems) engineering (Case) is a family oftechnologies based on the construction of models, at various levels ofdetail, of the system under development.andP;  Traditionally, Case products havefocused on the analysis and design phase of the development process(so-called upper-Case capabilities).andP;  For the remainder of this article, theterm &quot;Case&quot; will refer to these analysis/design toolkits.andM;Case methods provide rules and suggest strategies for constructing modelsthat are typically expressed using graphical notations.andP;  Analysis and designmethods used with Case include functional decomposition and object-orienteddevelopment.andP;  Graphical notations supporting Case methods includeentity-relationship diagrams, Youdon/DeMarco or Gane/Sarson-style dataflowdiagrams, and, for realtime or reactive systems, the Ward/Mellor and Hatleynotations.andM;Case products typically support the use of one or more of these notations toconstruct and analyze models of the proposed system.andP;  Model analysis caninclude: syntax checking, completeness and consistency checking, and datamodel normalization.andP;  The graphical notations used for modeling realtimesystems are sufficiently formal that dynamic model analysis can include:reachability, deadlock and non-termination.andP;  Newer-generation Case products,such as Statemate from iLogix, Burlington, Mass., and foresight from AthenaSystems, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., provide early versions of thesecapabilities.andM;These models also contain enough information to construct performance models.andO;Current Case tools have not, however, exploited this fact.andM;Some Case tools, such as CardTools from Ready Systems, Sunnyvale, Calif.,andO;provide performance analysis capabilities.andP;  Here, however, analysis islimited to a particular language (Ada) and target environment (VRTX/ARTX).andO;Performance estimations also require information that is not available untilthe latter stages of design or implementation.andP;  Thus, early assessments ofperformance are not possible.andP;  While these capabilities are a step in theright direction, there is much more to be done.andM;MEETING PERFORMANCE GOALSandM;Software performance engineering is a method for constructing softwaresystems that meet performance goals.andP;  [C.U.andP;  Smith, &quot;Software PerformanceEngineering,&quot; Proceedings of Computer Measurement Group Conference XII, NewOrleans, La., Dec. 1981, pp.andP;  5-14.]  It provides a framework for modelingsoftware requirements and designs to predict performance.andP;  The predictperformance is then evaluated to determine whether the goals can be met.andP;  Ifnot, alternatives are developed and assessed, and corrective action is takenbefore proceeding.andM;This process continues from the requirements analysis phase through detaileddesign, with the development of increasingly more precise models of thesoftware and analysis of its predicted performance.andP;  As code is produced andtesting begins, SPE continues with performance measurement and management ofthe evolving software.andM;SPE includes techniques for gathering data, compensating for uncertainty,constructing and evaluating performance models, evaluating alternatives andverifying and validating results.andP;  It also includes strategies for theeffective use of these techniques.andP;  With SPE, the metrics obtained fromperformance models can be related to the software architecture, thecharacteristics of the workload and the characteristics of the target(hardware and software) environment.andP;  This allows the construction andevaluation of alternative models.andM;SPE methods and the tools that support them emerged from the technical areasof performance evaluation and capacity planning [C.U.andP;  Smith, &quot;Evolution ofSoftware Performance Engineering: A Survey,&quot; Proceedings of the Fall JointComputer Conference,, Dallas, Tex., Nov. 1986, pp.andP;  778-783.]  For example,capacity planners create models of their current configuration, usemeasurement data to characterize workloads and calibrate the model to matchexisting performance metrics.andP;  They examine future needs by using forecastsof future workload volumes and resource requirements, and study hardwareconfigurations that will satisfy those needs.andM;Initial applications of SPE supplemented capacity planners' measurements ofexisting workloads with models of new software in early development stages.andO;This was done to forecast the new software's transaction volumes and resourcerequirements.andP;  The models then predicted hardware requirements of systemsearly enough to enable timely procurement.andM;There are many performance modeling tools available that provide capacityplanning decision support, such as Best/1 from BGS Systems Inc., Waltham,Mass., Map from Amdahl Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif., and SES/Workbench fromScientific and Engineering Software, Austin, Tex.andM;Mature SPE efforts use model predictions to evaluate trade-off in softwarefunctions versus hardware cost.andP;  Model predictions are also used to controlresource requirements by selecting requirements and designs with acceptableperformance characteristics.andP;  They track and manage performance throughoutdevelopment to prevent problems that can threaten successful and timelyproject completion from surfacing late in the development process; forexample, integration testing.andM;Case and SPE methods, notations and tools evolved independently.andP;  As aresult, there are several barriers to integration.andP;  The notations used forconstructing analysis/design models and SPE models are very different.andP;  Inaddition, the information maintained in the upper-Case tool repositoriescontain some, but not all, of the data needed by SPE tools.andM;There is, however, no reason why Case and SPE cannot be more closelyintegrated.andP;  As the fictional scenario suggested, the methods arecomplementary.andP;  The results of SPE analysis can provide valuable feedback inthe analysis and design stages.andP;  Despite notational differences, the modelsthe two approaches use are very similar.andP;  Integration of Case and SPE toolswould eliminate the need to construct and maintain consistency betweenredundant sets of models and make it possible to receive this feedback in amore timely fashion.andM;Several organizations are already combining Case and SPE on and ad hoc basis.andO;MCI Telecommunications Corporation, Arlington, Va., regularly uses SPEtechniques.andP;  Alfonso Rodriguez, a senior software performance analyst,described recent efforts on a new Network Provisioning System.andM;&quot;The system maintains a very large database of circuit activity, networkconnections and circuits available, and processes orders for new analog anddigital services generated by other remote, automated systems,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The database consists of approximately 150 DB2 tables with sizes rangingfrom one million to 95 million rows.andP;  The software consists of 983 programs.andO;An average program makes 100 database accesses.&quot;andM;According to Rodriguez, developers implemented the system within 10 monthsusing the Method/1 and Design/1 Case tools from Chicago-based ArthurAndersen.andM;&quot;Our SPE team involvement began in the project initiation phase,&quot; Rodriguezsaid.andP;  &quot;In the early stages we created and evaluated Crystal [from BGSSystems Inc.] and Paws [from Scientific andamp; Engineering Software] models toidentify and alleviate potential bottlenecks, and to determine the bestmechanisms for transmission of data between remote systems.andM;&quot;Subsequent efforts concentrated on the critical components.andP;  During detaileddesign and coding we used performance reviews to monitor the DB2 databasestructure and the SQL within programs.andP;  We found that some inexperiencedprogrammers created 'fancy' queries that would have excessive run times.andO;With strong management backing, we instituted early corrective action,&quot;Rodriguez said.andM;During integration testing, MCI used IBM's TeleProcessing Network Simulator(TPNS) with a suite of performance measurement tools for functional, stressand volume tests.andP;  They tuned DB2, CICS, and Vsam to reduce system overhead,and conducted studies that identified programs causing the highest DB2activity.andP;  They then bactracked to the queries tables and indices causinginefficient performance, and analyzed and implemented alternatives to reducethe total access path, I/O and sort costs.andM;The combined efforts of the software developers and performance engineersresulted in a system which was deployed on time, functioned correctly and hadexceptional performance.andP;  &quot;On the first day of operation, we were able toprocess a peak load of 50 online transactions per second, with an averageend-to-end response time of 0.33 seconds,&quot; Rodriguez said.andP;  &quot;The system alsoran a concurrent batch workload of 1,500 jobs.andP;  Everyone was both amazed anddelighted with the system's initial performance.&quot;andM;Developers at Baltimore Gas and Electric have also experimented with Case andSPE integration.andP;  Marc Cherbonnier, systems project leader for the CustomerInformation System (CIS) project, said, &quot;We began with performance benchmarksto study the feasibility of using DB2 for our new CIS.andP;  Then, developers usedArthur Andersen's Method/1 and Design/1 to document their design, andInstall/1 to assist in implementation.andP;  Our performance engineering team usedthe Design/1 reports in performance walk-through to identify potentialproblems.andM;&quot;We combined the performance data to predict the computer capacity that thenew system will require.andP;  We used spreadsheet models to analyze logical andphysical I/Os for key processes in the system.andP;  Early efforts focused ontransaction response times.andP;  Later, we also found a key batch process thatrequires 1.8 million physical data table I/Os and approximately the samenumber of index I/Os.andM;&quot;Obviously, this process cannot complete within our batch window.andP;  We knowthat if we can structure our tables and break the processing into subsetsthat can run concurrently, we can prevent a serious performance problem&quot;Cherbonnier said.andM;&quot;Now we are using TPNS to conduct performance and stress tests to ensure thatwe will meet performance goals upon delivery.andP;  Although we have not deployedthe system, we are confident that our early studies led to a system correctlysized to handle the load.andP;  We can now process 22 user transactions per second(56 CICS transactions) with 90% of the end-to-end response time under twoseconds.candM;Success was not always easy.andP;  &quot;While Case tools helped in our early SPEstudies, as we got closer to the project deadline, the performance testershave found inconsistencies between design documentation, theperformance-tested version of code and the latest version.andP;  After we prepareperformance recommendations we have to double check to make sure that theystill apply,&quot; Cherbonnier said.andP;  &quot;We also found that the early designspecifications were overly optimistic.&quot;andM;An ideal unified Case product would alleviate many of their manual SPE tasks,provide early warning of changes that cause new performance problems andminimize design and code inconsistencies.andP;  Cherbonnier added, &quot;An idealproduct should incorporate measurement data as the software evolves foreasier performance validation.andP;  It should also provide performance feedbackto users so they can distinguish between a new system that is a 'greyhound'versus one that is a 'hog.'andP;  Then they can apply pressure to get the systemthey want.andP;  The measurement problem will challenge product developers,though.andP;  With DB2, a small test database causes transactions to behave verydifferently than they will in a production environment.&quot;andM;SPE HOT OFF THE PRESSandM;Ralph Terkowitz, vice president of data processing at the Washington Post,described that organization's approach to software development.andP;  &quot;We rigidlyadhere to SPE methods.andP;  Designers understand performance-design principlesand apply them from the outset to create a workable system plan.andP;  Then we uselower-Case tools such as Cullinet's ADS/Online fourth-generation language[now owned by Computer Associates, Garden City, N.Y.] to produce software.andM;&quot;With this combined approach, all our new systems meet their performanceobjectives.&quot;andP;  For SPE modeling, &quot;we use simple, pencil and paper models tomake design decisions for individual systems,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We use Best/1 toevaluate the overall effect of all new systems to make sure that we do not'run out of gas.'&quot;andM;Dean Berry, consulting engineer at Covia, Rosemont, Ill., the United Airlinesreservation system provider, described an early success with applying SPE totheir North American Fare Quote System.andM;&quot;The system finds the lowest available airfares between two cities, takinginto account seat availability, alternative routing and so forth,&quot; Berrysaid.andP;  &quot;Software developers collaborated with performance engineersthroughout the system reengineering life cycle.andP;  Developers had been 'burned'in the past by performance and wanted to prevent problems.andM;&quot;Together, we not only improved the quality of the fare quotes -- to 100%accuracy -- we also reduced DASD I/O by approximately 60% and CPU utilizationby approximately 38%, while increasing the functionality to include everyapplicable fare.&quot;andM;According to Berry, Covia had no Case tools for the first project, but plansto use Atlanta-based Knowledge Ware's IEW Workbench with the established SPEtechniques for its new international fare quote system.andM;In all these cases, the practitioners &quot;manually&quot; combined the twotechnologies.andP;  As a result, they encountered communication problems, such as:gathering data from diverse groups, matching performance results to currentsoftware status, justifying changes and so forth.andP;  Many of these problemswould not occur if the support tools were better integrated.andM;TOWARDS INTEGRATIONandM;Bill Inmon, senior principal with American Management Systems, Denver, said,&quot;Case has been focused on the business function to the exclusion ofeverything else.andP;  As Case matures, and its focus broadens, it is inevitablethat the focus will turn to SPE.&quot;andM;Kenneth Kolence of Kolence Associates, Palo Alto, Calif., was the 1974recipient of the Computer Measurement Group's (CMG) AA Michelson award forhis pioneering work in performance measurement.andP;  He is a strong advocate ofCase and SPE integration.andP;  &quot;The motivation for my early measurement work wasto provide the theoretical and practical foundation for the design plusperformance combination,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Most current SPE tools, though, are usedafter the design is complete; they use detailed design data, and report itsperformance characteristics.andP;  Not only does this require duplication ofeffort (because the tools are not integrated), it also addresses the wrongproblem.andM;&quot;Tools need to support the earlier design synthesis process to enabledesigners to explore alternatives to the fundamental function and form of thesystem,&quot; Kolence explained.andP;  &quot;My research focuses on higher-level methodsthat will enable this exploration.&quot;andM;Alan Howard, vice president of operations for Applied Computer Research inPhoenix, said, &quot;Those who endeavor into the Case world should alreadyunderstand that a basic premise behind Case is quality.andP;  SPE should be highon their list of quality concerns.andP;  In the SPE area there is no shortage of'reactive' tools, but that is not where the economics are.andP;  The economics ofSPE are early in the life cycle where tools are very sparse.&quot;andM;Robert Gray, manager of SPE at MCI, pointed out another serious problemcaused by the lack of tool integration.andP;  &quot;In our environment, we have verytight development schedules,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Performance engineers must gatherdesign data and construct independent performance models.andP;  If they finddesign problems, developers may not have time to rebuild the designdescription.andM;Even though the design is suboptimal, they must live with their first designpass.andP;  This often results in excessive hardware capacity costs, large ongoingoperational costs, crisis tuning efforts and resulting deterioration of codequality.andP;  After delivery, performance becomes a tangible problem, and thesecond release of the software imposes a performance requirement.andM;&quot;If the tools were integrated, designers could explore alternatives beforecommitting to designs,&quot; Gray said.andP;  &quot;Exploring performance alternatives wouldbe equivalent to exploring design alternatives, thus the design revisionswould be a byproduct of the exploration.&quot;andM;According to Gray, there is also an economic barrier.andP;  &quot;Who pays fordevelopment costs versus operational costs?andP;  If the developer is notaccountable for ongoing operational costs, their priority will be on reduceddevelopment costs even though the net cost is much higher.&quot;andM;BGE's Cherbonnier added that &quot;even though my own 'homegrown' spreadsheetmodels indicated performance problems, developers were skeptical of theresults.andP;  A performance tool integrated with the Case tool would have hadmore credibility.&quot;andP;  This observation was seconded by most of thepractitioners cited in this article.andM;Furthermore, models and tools alone are insufficient.andP;  Both Case and SPE needto be integrated into a formal software development process and formalanalysis and design methods.andP;  Then developers will better understand the roleof Case and SPE, what steps are needed and when they should be conducted.andO;Thus, both technologies will be used more effectively.andM;To promote the method and process integration, some members of the CMG areforming a task force to build the SPE and capacity planning steps into IBM'sproposed AD/Cycle and SAA process models.andP;  (Contact CMG Chicago headquartersat 312-938-1228 to participate.)andM;Computer-aided engineering and computer-integrated manufacturing (CAE-CIM)have inspired both Case and SPE evolution.andP;  Are engineering tools betterintegrated than software engineering tools?andP;  Dr. David Loendorf, staffscientist responsible for CAE-CIM tools at Los Alamos National Laboratory inCalifornia, said.andP;  &quot;Most current CAE-CIM tools integrate analysis and design.andO;They evolved together because the same engineer was interested in both designand analysis [models], and created computer tools to provide an integratedsystem.&quot;andM;With so many problems to be solved by Case tools, will vendors have time toaddress SPE integration?andP;  There are already some good signs.andM;Cadre Technologies, Providence, R.I., offers Teamwork as its comprehensiveCase tool.andP;  Joe SiSanto, simulation product manager, said, &quot;We believe thatdynamic modeling of both behavior and performance is critical to goodsoftware design.andP;  Accordingly, we provide worldwide marketing and support forthe ADAS performance evaluation project, developed by the Research TriangleInstitute, Research Triangle Park, N.C.andP;  ADAS provides graphical performanceevaluation capabilities, including animated simulation and color feedback, toaid in interpreting its results.andM;&quot;The ADAS developers provide us with continuing support and enhancements,&quot;DiSanto said.andP;  &quot;We plan to smooth the transition between design andperformance models.andP;  Our first step is to provide a bidirectional graphicaltranslator between Teamwork and ADAS.andP;  A designer can create either aperformance or design model and automatically translate it to the other.andP;  Wealso plan to enhance the simulation capabilities, and to fully integrate thetwo models.andM;&quot;Teamwork is widely used for real-time embedded systems; it is also usefulfor MIS systems,&quot; DiSanto continued.andP;  &quot;Some of our MIS users have found itvaluable for configuring distributed processing systems with a mix ofhardware systems and network interconnections.andP;  The models enabled them toevaluate capacity, fault tolerance, throughput and response time.&quot;andM;A REFRESHING APPROACHandM;A product with a refreshing approach to integration--even though it appliesin a specialized environment seldom found in MIS applications--is CardToolsfrom Ready Systems.andM;Likewise, the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) inAustin, Tex., a joint research consortium of U.S.andP;  computer manufacturers,has incorporated performance modeling capabilities into Verdi, their visualtool for designing distributed systems.andP;  Among other functions, it depicts acolor animation of system behavior and reports times (mean, variance,distribution) between start and end markets.andP;  Verdi is currently onlyavailable to MCC's member companies.andM;Some vendors of SPE tools are not waiting for Case vendors.andP;  The firstgeneration of performance modeling tools were oriented to capacity plannerswho were familiar with performance models and used them to study hardwaretrade-offs.andP;  However, the new generation of SPE tools is built for developerswith some performance modeling skills who wish to use tools for softwaretrade-off studies as well as hardware sizing.andM;PerSpective from Advanced System Technology in Denver combines elements ofboth Case and performance modeling tools.andP;  Traditional data and control-flowdescriptions of software are integrated into stimulus-control-flows that aremore amenable to performance evaluation.andP;  Specification of hardwarearchitecture completes the information required to produce standard measuresof performance using both analytic and discrete event simulation models.andM;Robert Goettge, president, said, &quot;A prototype version of PerSpective was usedto model the U.S.andP;  En-route Air Traffic Control software.andP;  The softwarespecification consisted of more than 50 stimulus-control flows containingover 2000 modes.andP;  Performance predictions were sufficiently accurate thatinconsistencies in physical data placement among centers were detected.&quot;andM;Apriori Systems, Inc., Chicago, has announced a tool that will allow softwaredevelopers to model software performance.andP;  The analyst will describe businessfactors, database and process design and evaluate resulting performancemetrics.andP;  Apriori plans to offer the product later this year.andM;Metron, based in the U.K., offers a performance engineering system consistingof an interactive, expert system, Perseus, combined with the firm's Athenesystems modeling tool.andM;Meanwhile, the original vendors of software performance modeling tools, BGSSystems, Inc. (Crystal) and Performance Systems, Inc., Rockville, Md.andP;  (ScertII), offer enhancements to their products as users identify desirable newfunctions.andP;  Crystal, for example, provides a flat-file interface that,together with a user-defined translation utility, allows information fromCase tools to be imported.andM;Another new tool bridges the gap between Case and SPE.andP;  Design Enhancer,marketed by Applied Computer Research, Phoenix, addresses the logicaldatabase design phase.andP;  It asks designers questions about the application,the execution environment and the database.andP;  It then produces reportssuggesting additional data need, critical areas to watch and so forth.andM;Richard E. Fiori, a senior analyst in data services at Arizona PublicService, has used Applied Computer Research's Design Enhancer to evaluate newsubsystems for the Customer Information System.andP;  He said, &quot;It asks questionsabout our logical data model [and other system characteristics], and suggestsalternatives when it detects problems.andP;  Once it suggested that I shouldseparate operational data from decision support data.andP;  It was right.andP;  I was'pounding' on one set.andP;  Now I keep that principle in mind.andP;  It serves as agood communication and documentation aid.andP;  It does not require you to makechanges, but you have a checklist ad can document your actions and reasons.&quot;andM;SPE provides a means for developing software that meets its performancerequirements without sacrificing other desirable qualities.andP;  While there aretools that support software analysis and design and tools that support SPE,they are currently poorly integrated, if at all.andM;Despite the difficulties involved in manually combining Case and SPE tools,several users have been successful in making SPE an integral part of theirdevelopment process.andP;  More effective use of these techniques will requirebetter automated support in the form of tightly integrated Case and SPEtools.andP;  Recent trends in tool development are encouraging, but there is stillroom for improvement.andM;Smith, Ph.D., a consultant based in Santa Fe, N.M., specializes in SPEseminars and consulting services.andP;  She received CMG's AA michelson award forher work in SPE.andP;  She is author of Performance Engineering of SoftwareSystems, recently published by Addison-Wesley.andM;Williams, Ph.D., is a Boulder, Colo.-based consultant who specializes inpre-implementation support for software systems development.andP;  His workemphasizes methods, tools and support environments for the description andanlysis of software designs.andP;  He is the author of over 50 technical articles.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
