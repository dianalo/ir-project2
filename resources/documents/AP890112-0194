Traders said there was concerted dollar-selling by the FederalReserve and the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, Britain,Belgium, Austria, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and perhaps others.   ``It was very hectic. The market just sort of twisted andturned,'' said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and manager offoreign-exchange trading at Continental Bank in Chicago.   High U.S. interest rates have made the dollar attractive toglobal investors, while the West German mark has been under heavyselling pressure because of low German interest rates.   Central banks have been fighting the trend because of fears thatcurrencies are becoming misaligned and could cause economic damage.Among other things, a strong dollar would hurt progress in reducingthe huge U.S. trade deficit.   The dollar reached a three-month high of 1.84 marks in Europeantrading before succumbing to central-bank intervention and finishedthe day in New York between 1.82 marks and 1.83 marks.
