(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The DBMS DesignandM;The biggest development in the LAN database arena is the PC database server.andO;Suddenly, every major databse vendor has announced a PC database server orsupport for a PC database server.andP;  The first PC database server came formGupta Technologies (Menlo Park, CAlif.) more than two years ago.andO;Minicomputer databases implemented the client-server architecture long beforethat.andP;  Only recently, however, has the architecture caught anyone's attentionnow that large software companies with even larger marketing budgets haveentered the fray.andM;Gupta has been joined in shipping a PC database server by such companies asOracle (Belmont, Calif.), Ashton-Tate (Torrance, Calif.), VIA InformationSystems (Princeton, N.J.), XDB (College Park,  Md.), and Novell DevelopmentProducts Division (Austin, Texas).andP;  IBM includes a PC database server as partof the Database Manager of OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2 (which, at this writing,is about to ship).andP;  Lotus (Cambridge, Mass.) announced Lotus/DBMS but a shipdate has not been set.andM;In addition, Ashton-Tate, Borland (Scotts Valley, Calif.), Microrim (Redmond,Wash.), DataAccess (Miami, Fla.), DataEase International (Trumbull, Conn.),andO;Information Builders (New York, N.Y.), Unify (Sacramento, Calif.), RevelationTechnologies (Believue, Wash.), and several other companies announced thattheir database products will act as front ends for at least one of thedatabase servers.andP;  However, only one of these vendors is shipping anything ofthe kind at the moment; Information Builders is shipping a version of Focusfor SQL Server.andM;Despite this death of front-end products, the excitement over databaseservers is justified.andP;  For the first time, the pieces to create a LAN-based,distributed platform for running mission-critical database applications arefalling into place.andP;  The hardware is in place in the form of powerful 386 PCsconnected with Ethernet and Token Ring.andP;  The communications software isready, including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, Named Pipes, AP PC, SPX/PX, and DECnet.andO;The database server software includes SQL Server, SQLBase, Oracle Server,NetWare SQL, and OS/2 Database Manager.andP;  Structured Query Language (SQL) isthe chosen query language.andP;  All that is needed are front-end products anddevelopment tools, which should arrive soon.andM;More exciting than database servers are distributed databases.andP;  Databaseservers form the basis for distributed databases, but they are not the same.andO;DAtabase servers have one server and many users.andP;  Distributed databases havemany servers and many users.andP;  The differences are profound.andP;  For now, it isenough to say that one company, VIA Information Systems, is shipping a true.andO;LAN-Based distributed database system and several other companies will shipsimilar products soon.andP;  The adoption of NetWise's Remote Procedure Call Toolby several LAN database vendors should speed the development of distributeddatabases.andM;The LAN database market is at a turning point, stuck in the middle of atransition from file-server-based database management systems (DBMSs) todatabase servers and distributed databases.andM;The advantages of a database server over a file-server-based DBMS arewell-known.andP;  Database servers perform better, use less network band-width,save on workstation resources, and are more reliable and secure inmission-critical applications.andP;  They allow for the use of databaseinformation by programs other than database management applications, forexample, Excel, Lotus, and PageMaker.andM;Choosing a database sever is not easy.andP;  Although a number of companies offerDOS-based database servers (XDB systems, Gupta Techonologies, and ViaInformation Systems), most of the hoopla surrounds the OS/2-based databaseservers.andP;  In general, OS/2's multitasking architecture is better prepared tohandle the multiple, simultaneous requests a database server inevitablyreceives and it is able to address 16MB of memory speeds processing throughcaching and stored procedures.andP;  This does not mean DOS-based servers areuseless; DOS-based servers are used best in applications with fewer users andsmaller databases.andM;UNIX-based databse servers are an option, especially now that 3+Open,NetWare, and other network operating systems support TCP/IP.andP;  3+Open's DemandProtocol Architecture allows DOS-based clients to run applicationsefficiently over a TCP/IP link, which is perfect for communicating with AUNIX-based databased server like those from Oracle, Informix, ProgressSoftware, Information Builders, Unity, and Relational Techonology.andM;Database servers differ in their architecture.andP;  The Ashton-Tate/Micro-soft/Sybase SQL Server uses one process to handle the entire database.andP;  OracleServer for OS/2 uses four cooperating processes.andP;  VIA DRE from VIAInformationSystems stores all transactions in a single-file stack, thereby preservingthe entire database in each succeeding version.andP;  Gupta Technologies' SQLBasehas a three-part structure.andM;Just two aspects of the advantages and disadvantages of these architecturesshould be explored here: performance and functionality.andP;  No formal,independent performance test results have been published for the shippingdatabase servers, making comparison impossible.andP;  Nevertheless, performancefor each database server is contingent on the application.andP;  Some databaseserver might handle decision-support applications more efficiently thantransaction-processing applications, while others might not.andM;The same is true for functionality.andP;  Database servers are extremely complexprograms whose features vary widely.andP;  Which features are necessary depends onthe type of application users' wish to build.andP;  For example, the concurrencycould in a browsing application is different from that required in anapplication updating one record at a time.andP;  some database servers handle thefirst situation more efficiently than the second, while others might have theopposite results.andM;Protocols and ConnectionsandM;Database servers differ in the protocols they support, and the connectionsthey can make.andP;  Only Oracle and Gupta Technologies support connectionsbetween their database servers and IBM's DB2.andP;  The only database servervendor to support relational joins between two serves transparently is VIA Information Systems (the test of a true distributed database).andM;More important than the connections support is the programmatic interfacesupport for such connections.andP;  For example, the Ashton-Tate-/Microsoft/SybaseSQL Server has a programmatic interface called DB Library.andP;  That is, userswishing to write application programs that use SQL Server must write the DBLibrary interface.andP;  Users wishing to use Oracle database servers must writeto Oracle's programmatic interface or use Oracle's applications developmenttools.andP;  The same is true for all othe database server vendors.andM;Two issues crop up here.andP;  First, is this so bad? Isn't it true that when youpick a DBMS, you are picking a programmatic interface and a set ofdevelopment tools, such as dBASE or Paradox? Yes.andP;  However, when you pick adatabase server and a programmatic interface, you also pick the set ofconnections that programmatic interface supports.andP;  Using Oracle'sprogrammatic interface, an application may run on all of Oracle's platforms,which are too many to list, and make connections to othe supported databasesystems, including DB2 and SQL/DS.andP;  Applications written to DB Library canonly use SQL Server data.andM;The second issue is SQL.andP;  Doesn't SQL allow users and applications to talk toany server?andP;  No.andP;  For example, if an order entry application is written in Cusing SQL Server's DB Library interface, it cannot be transferred to anotherdatabase server.andP;  This can be seen in the current front-end products fordatabase servers.andP;  The first application was SQLFile from Vinzant (Portage,Ind.), which is an easy-to-use program for viewing and editing data stored inSQL Server.andP;  Although future versions will support other database servers,the current version does not.andM;Many people think the incompatibility is due to dialect differences in SQLimplementations.andP;  Not so.andP;  Such differences are a minor problem.andP;  The realcause for incompatibility is the lack of standardization.andP;  No standard existsfor how SQL should &quot;talk&quot; to the transport layer providing the link betweenclient and server.andP;  As Gene Shklar, director of marketing for the NetworkProducts Division of Oracle points out, &quot;[Standardization] involvesspecifying how to break down the SQL statement and encapsulate it.andP;  How manycolumns will be sent between server and client at a time?andP;  What are the datatypes of the columns so the application can allocate storage?andP;  How many rowswill be sent at a time?andP;  How are errors communicated?andP;  And there are manyothers issues that every vendor handles differently.&quot;andM;Oracle's SQL*Net provides the interface between its front-end applicationtools and network protocols.andP;  This product allows applications to move fromnetwork to network without modification.andP;  All that's needed is a differentversion of SQL*Net.andP;  Other vendors have similar products, though nonesupports as many network environments as Oracle.andM;While efforts are being made to standardize the interface between SQL and thetransport layer, a workable standard will not be produced soon.andP;  Meanwhile,users should pick the data-base server that supports the environments theyneed.andP;  Most vendors have promised to add support for more protocols as soonas they can.andP;  This will not make applications portable from database serverto database server but will allow them to take advantage of data on differentnetworks and hosts.andM;The standardization problem can be viewed from another angle.andP;  SQL Serverrequires Named Pipes.andP;  Thus, the network used must support Named Pipes.andP;  Atthis time, the only networks supporting Named Pipes are based on theMicrosoft OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  Novell announced support for Named Pipes andwill soon ship.andP;  Oracle database servers support many protocols and run onmany networks and hosts.andP;  Gupta Technologies supports NetBIOS and APPC and isworking on Named Pipes.andP;  Other database servers, such as NetWare SQL, are orhave versions for specific networks, such as NetWare SQL.andM;Application DevelopmentandM;In the PC world, database applications usually are developed with fourthgeneration languages, including dBASE, Paradox, FoxBase, DataFlex, Oracle,Revelation, and R:Base.andP;  These languages include the functions for buildingsophisticated, multitable, single-user applications.andP;  In many cases, thedatabase engines they use have the capacity to perform file and recordlocking, allowing the products to work on network file server.andM;This environment is good for building decision support applications.andO;Paradox, dBASE, and the like are perfect for massaging data and producingreports.andP;  Generating a sales report on data imported from a mainframedatabase is the perfect application for such DBMSs.andM;However, the PC database application development environment is lacking inseveral areas.andP;  First, the performance of most database engines is not enoughto support multiple simultaneous requests from multiple users over a LAN,which is the application discussed here.andP;  Second, the concurrency control tokeep the requests from bumping into each other is not adequate.andP;  Althoughprograms such as Paradox support nonexclusive locking and screen refresh,this is not enough in large browse applications or in transaction processingenvironments when several records are updated at a time.andP;  Finally, thereliability and security needed for such mission-critical applications doesnot exist in the current crop of DBMSs.andM;Database servers, often adapted from minicomputer database architectures, arebetter suited to support mission-critical, transaction processingapplications.andP;  They have the necessary horsepower, architecture, concurrencycontrol, reliability, and security.andP;  However, database servers vary in thefeatures they provide to develop these applications.andM;Virtually all database servers allow the user to define rules.andP;  Rules helpadd and store database management intelligence in the database server.andO;Suppose we always want numbers to be displayed with commas.andP;  We can set arule (that is, write a short program) at the database server to make surethat numbers are displayed with commas.andP;  Then, any application made for usingthe database server displays numbers this way automatically.andP;  If we want todisplay numbers differently, we can change every application by making onechange at the database server.andP;  This is very convenient.andM;Another application development feature of database servers is storedprocedures, which are little programs executed over and over again.andP;  They are&quot;stored&quot; in that they are written once and kept at the database server, notin the application.andP;  Applications can call them to do their task, such as adda record to a table.andP;  Stored procedures speed application development andexecution by eliminating the need to include them in the application and byperforming the task in the database server instead of in the clientworkstation.andM;Stored procedures have a problem.andP;  They are different on every databaseserver, again making it difficult to move applications from database serverto database server.andP;  Stored procedures are supposed to be collections of SQLstatements performing management tasks on data stored at the database server.andO;However, a number of vendors, including Oracle andAshton-Tate/Microsoft/Sybase, have &quot;enhanced&quot; their SQL implementation tosupport procedural operation.andP;  For example, SQL Server uses Transact SQL,allowing IF-THEN-ELSE statements.andP;  Pure SQL does not support such statements.andM;In addition to eliminating portability, &quot;enhanced&quot; SQL assures thatapplications cannot access data in other environments supporting SQL.andP;  Forexample, if you write an application to Transact SQL, it will never be ableto talk to DB2, even if a connection between SQL Server and DB2 is developed.andM;Stored procedures are important, but you must decide on the stored procedureswhen picking your database.andP;  Your choice of stored procedures may have makean impact what you can do, including the connections you make.andM;The same holds true for the rules supported by the database server andtriggers.andP;  A trigger is a cross between a rule and a stored procedure.andP;  Itcontains SQL language but it is executed automatically, without being calledby an application.andM;Finally, stored procedures, triggers, and rules can be a problem if theyshould guarantee data integrity.andP;  Suppose one database server has a storedprocedure and another does not.andP;  An application may assume the presence of astored procedure when executing against the two servers.andP;  The server withoutthe stored procedure may corrupt data because it does not contain the storedprocedure to protect the data.andP;  As Umang Gupta, president of GuptaTechnologies and developer of SQLBase, points out, &quot;We make no extensions toSQL.andP;  We use stored procedures only for performance purposes, not for dataintegrity.andP;  Our engine handles the integrity.&quot;andM;The Front EndandM;So how will we use the application development features to developmission-critical, transaction processing applications.andP;  The real tools fordeveloping such database server applications will come from a slew offront-end products.andP;  The four types of products are DBMSs based on fourthgeneration languages, spreadsheets, high-level languages, and a category wewill loosely call tools.andM;Most database vendors have announced a DBMS supporting one or more SQLdatabase servers.andP;  These vendors promise that their languages, formsgenerators, report writers, and application generators allow the uninitiateduser to develop sophisticated network applications.andP;  Differentiating theseproducts is not easy, but the features differentiating them before SQLdatabase servers will still be the features to look at.andP;  Information Buildersis the first company to ship a version of its DBMS, called Foruc, that willwork with SQL Server.andM;In the spreadsheet arena, only Microsoft's Excel and Lotus's 1-2-3 are poisedto work with database servers.andP;  Gupta Technologies is at work on a programallowing Excel users to create macros for entering, retrieving, andmanipulating data stored on its SQLBase database server.andP;  Microsoft planssimilar features for Excel and SQL Server.andP;  The new release of 1-2-3 hasdatabase extensions that will work with several database servers.andM;The most popular language for developing database server applications is C.andO;SQL Server users have no other choice at the moment; they must use C.andO;SQLBase users can use C or COBOL.andP;  Oracle users have more options.andP;  DaveVinzant, president of Vinzant, found that most users he spoke to use C todevelop for SQL Server rather than wait for fourth generation languages toappear.andP;  &quot;The cost-savings potential is huge.andP;  These companies are large.andO;They can migrate processing time from the mainframe to the LAN, saving onmainframe CPU costs and monthly service charges.andP;  It helps that they have theskill to do C and Presentation Manager work,&quot; says Vinzant.andM;Umang Gupta found that some 40 percent of his companies customers use COBOL.andO;&quot;The popularity is in this area because the people writing these applicationsar MIS people and they still have the largest expertise in COBOL.&quot;andM;A couple of products make databases more accessible to the inexperienced.andO;SQLFile from Vinzant allows users to manipulate data stored in an SQL Serverwithout knowing SQL or programming applications.andP;  It is not a developmenttool, but it can help developers manipulate SQL Server while working withother development tools.andM;A true database-server development tool is SQL Windows from GuptaTechnologies.andP;  It helps programmers generate Windows-based applications thatcan access SQLBase of DB2 (and soon Oracle and others).andP;  Knowledge of C orprogramming in Microsoft Windown environments is not necessary but it helpsto take advantage of the program.andP;  The program is a Windows program.andP;  Asusers draw windows and boxes, SQLWindows creates the C code and SQLstatements to build an application.andP;  In a short time, extremely sophisticatedand good-looking programs that use database servers can be created.andP;  (See&quot;Test Drive&quot; in the October 1989 LAN Magazine.)andM;Other tools due to arrive include libraries of stored procedures, triggers,and procedures for use with SQL database servers.andP;  Vertical marketapplication developers will be their prime suppliers.andP;  Imagine a set ofstored procedures for SQL Server that set up accounting rules or implementthe basics of an inventory tracking system.andP;  They'll arrive in a year or so.andM;Blue in the WingsandM;Throughout this article, we barely mentioned what IBM is doing for databaseservers and network database application development.andP;  To put it simply, IBMis out to conquer the network database world and is about to take a hugestep.andP;  In November, it will ship an enhanced Database Manager as part of OS/2Extended Edition 1.2.andP;  The new database manager includes a database server,using APPC and NetBIOS as the communications protocols, that will supportboth OS/2 and DOS clients.andM;The workings of the IBM database server is not particularly unique (althoughit has some unique features including support for more languages than otherdatabase servers).andP;  Users buying OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2 will receive LANsupport, communications support, a DBMS, and a database server for one (low)price.andP;  With links to OfficeVision and this low price, the IBM databaseserver will be an attractive alternative.andM;Distributed DatabasesandM;As mentioned, database servers and distributed databases are not the same.andO;Distributed databases require the ability to work transparently with data,regardless of where the data resides.andP;  Only one distributed database systemis shipping, VIA DRE from VIA Information Systems.andM;VIA DRE uses a dual data dictionary.andP;  Each database server operatesindependently (there is no &quot;master&quot;) and includes a dictionary describing thedata it holds.andP;  Each user has a dictionary handling application requests byconnecting the user to the appropriate database server.andP;  The user dictionaryknows where the data is so the application and the user need not.andP;  Data canbe moved to the most convenient location without rewriting applications.andM;A distributed database has two key features.andP;  The first is the ability to doa relational join with two tables from two database servers.andP;  The second isthe ability to write updates to two or more sites as part of one transaction.andO;VIA DRE takes care of the first through the data dictionaries.andP;  It takes careof the second using a two-phase commit routine.andM;Oracle supports multilocation joins for reading but not a two-phase commitroutine, which would allow it to do multilocation updates.andP;  Thus, it is not atrue distributed database.andP;  The company has already announced plans to addthis feature.andM;Meanwhile, VIA allows users to develop distributed database applications.andO;VIA C Object-Oriented Language (VIACOOL) is a fourth generation languagebased on C.andP;  It incorporates macros for building windowed, distributedapplications.andP;  Data transparency extends to programming in this language orwhen using SQL because the data dictionaries contain the data locationinformation.andP;  We saw a demonstration of an application in which a multitablejoin, involving a few hundred records, was done in about 30 seconds.andP;  Thatseems slow until you realize that one table was in Finland and the other inPrinceton, N.J.andM;Another front end for VIA DRE includes NPLR, a development and end-userreporting facility from DataBase Applications in Princeton, N.J.andP;  VIA isworking on an Excel interface and is close to an agreement for a Clipperinterface and an interface for Randamp;R, a report writing program from ConcentricSystems in Westboro, Mass.andM;Tricky StuffandM;Lan database servers are here.andP;  Distributed databases are here.andP;  Applicationsmay be built, though programming expertise is required.andP;  Front-end programswill reduce the knowledge barrier.andP;  However, even with such programs asParadox, dBASE, Advanced Revelation, and Focus, programming will still be anecessity.andP;  Large, sophisticated, mission-critical, transaction processingapplications will always require programming.andM;As Vinzant says, &quot;There is a fundamental flaw in the whole concept.andP;  userswant complicated, tricky stuff.andP;  But they want it to be done easily.andO;Application generators, form generators, and report writers make simplethings simple.andP;  Users have to add the tricky stuff.&quot;andM;Luckily, the pieces needed to conquer the tricky stuff, in the form ofdatabase server programmatic interfaces, high-level languages, libraries, anddevelopment tools, are available or will be soon.andP;  Better learn to program.andO;It will make life much easier.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
