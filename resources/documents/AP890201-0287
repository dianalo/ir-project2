Meanwhile, there were signs that some air travelers wererethinking their flight plans with a potential strike looming.   Eastern Airlines formally rejected binding arbitration Wednesdayto resolve the 16-month impasse, but the union was willing tosubmit, board Chairman Walter Wallace announced in a news releasefrom Washington.   ``There can be no change in rates of pay, rules or workingconditions or established practices in effect prior to the time thedispute arose, nor does the union have the right to strike duringthis 30-day period,'' said Wallace.   The 30-day cooling-off period begins Thursday and expires atmidnight March 3.   Both sides say salaries are the major remaining issue. Eastern isasking the 8,500-member Machinists union to take $150 million in paycuts, but the union wants $50 million in raises.   Federal mediator Robert Cerjan said every effort would be made toresolve the dispute during round-the-clock sessions.   Meanwhile, some travelers were showing signs they are concernedabout a possible disruption in air service by the Miami-basedcarrier. Eastern was taken over three years ago by Texas Air Corp.,which also owns non-union Continental Airlines.   Flying through Miami on his way home to Burlington, Vt., fromvacation in Paraguay, Eli Harvey said a strike ``would be a majorproblem. We're already having problems in Boston with them wantingto raise the tariffs and slow down the smaller traffic to Bostonfrom Burlington, so if Eastern goes on strike that could be a realproblem for us.''   Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst with Provident NationalBank in Philadelphia, said Eastern's latest moves could havenegative repercussions for the airline.   ``People that have scheduled flights for 30 days from now will atleast to some degree change their flight plans,'' he said. ``Thetraveling public goes, `Why take the chance?' ''   Eastern President Phil Bakes said in a statement Tuesday that heis ``guardedly optimistic'' a settlement can be reached underdeadline pressure.   The National Mediation Board claims a 98 percent success rate atavoiding strikes once negotiations reach this stage, but talk of anEastern strike already has raised discussion of sympathy strikes byother carriers.   Eastern Machinists chief Charles Bryan, who has long chargedTexas Air is trying to bust Eastern's unions and break up thecarrier, believes Eastern workers can gain strike support from otherairline workers.   ``We have international strengths throughout the world, anywhereContinental or Eastern airlines expects to get any help or anyinvolvement, including transferring of luggage or servicing theiraircraft by any unionized air carrier throughout the world, they'regoing to be stopped,'' he said.   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first threequarters of 1988 and has lost more than $1 billion in the pastdecade.   Eastern is awaiting completion of a $365 million sale of itsNortheast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump and hassaid it must sell other assets to stay afloat unless it can reducelabor costs.</TEXT></DOC>
