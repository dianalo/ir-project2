The group planned to issue $475 million in high-yield, or junk,bonds as the final financing of the leveraged buyout to take thecompany private. But in a two-week trip to nearly two dozen cities,officials of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., theunderwriters of the bond offering, discovered buyer resistance.   The buyout group consists of DLJ, railroad company Union PacificCorp., CNW and Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. of New York.   Chicago-based CNW is the parent of Chicago and North WesternTransportation Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees thatoperates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest.   Garrett Moran, head of DLJ's high-yield securities operations,said Friday that potential buyers of the railroad company'ssecurities indicated they wanted equity as well as better terms forthe junk bonds.   ``It's a skittish market,'' Moran said.   The result is that CNW's buyers will make a public equityoffering amounting to 10 percent of the ownership.   Blackstone, which holds 72 percent of the stock, and DLJ, whichtook 22 percent, each will give up a portion of their holdings on apro-rata basis for the initial public offering. The remaining 6percent is held by management, led by Chairman Robert Schmiege.   In five years, Union Pacific is expected to convert $100 millionin preferred shares into 25 percent ownership.   The buyers also agreed to raise the yield on the junk bonds byone quarter of 1 percent to 14.75 percent. CNW spokesman JamesFoote said DLJ estimates the added interest will amount to $2million a year.   In addition, the buyers have agreed to reset the interest rate12 months from now to a level that will allow the bonds to trade at101 percent of face value. That lowers the risk for buyers who areleery of the value of junk bonds in the current market.   Trouble in the junk bond market erupted last month when Canadianretail company Campeau Corp. said it would have trouble makingpayments on its high-yield debt. Since then, other junk bond issueshave plunged in price.</TEXT></DOC>
