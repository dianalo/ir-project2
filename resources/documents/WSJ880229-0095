The collapse of the sale agreement -- the largest and most complex in cable industry history -- leaves the would-be purchasing group without Storer's 1.5 million cable subscribers. And there is no buyer on the horizon that could swallow such a big and complicated purchase, which would require, among other things, the assumption of about $2.4 billion in debt in return for a billion in cash now in SCI's coffers.    As reported, the agreement had hit a number of snags in recent weeks as the group of cable operators, led by Time Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc., haggled with Kohlberg Kravis over the price and terms of the complex transaction. While industry executives believe the transaction could still be revived, both sides on Friday indicated that it was unlikely because of bad faith engendered by the failed negotiations.    &quot;The cable operators were not prepared to live up to the letter of intent and they wanted a price reduction,&quot; said Ted Ammon, an associate at Kohlberg Kravis. But John Malone, president of Denver-based Tele-Communications, said &quot;the reality of it is we tried to live up to the terms, but some of the representations they made to us were inaccurate and that was disclosed when we did due diligence on the deal.&quot;    Mr. Malone and other cable operators said that after examining the proposed transaction, they discovered that they would be saddled with certain tax and copyright fee liabilities. Some changes in copyright law that will require cable operators to increase the fees they pay program suppliers &quot;changed the financial impact of the deal,&quot; Mr. Malone said.    &quot;We wanted them to indemnify us against the (liabilities) but they weren't in a position to do so,&quot; Mr. Malone said. &quot;I think we conducted ourselves in an extremely flexible manner and reached further than we would have ever reached to do a deal, but there were very substantial concerns.&quot;    Mr. Ammon of Kohlberg Kravis countered that the cable group &quot;wanted a price reduction based on nothing substantial,&quot; and said &quot;there were no problems with taxes.&quot;    But he added that &quot;we like the cable business and we're prepared to stay in it&quot; until a viable buyer can be found. He said the company won't attempt to sell Storer's assets piecemeal. The investment concern &quot;is prepared to talk and will be talking to people&quot; interested in buying Storer Cable in its entirety, but there are no talks underway with anyone at present, he said.    The collapse of the Storer deal comes as cable systems are selling at record prices. John Waller, a cable systems broker who runs Waller Capital Inc. said the death of the transaction wouldn't have any impact on other sales.    &quot;It was a unique deal with all its various tax implications,&quot; Mr. Waller said. &quot;The tax structure makes it necessary to sell it off all at once and that limits the number of buyers. There aren't many people who could buy it in the cable business -- and we haven't seen a new entrant into the cable business in years.&quot;    Kohlberg bought Miami-based Storer Communications Inc. in a leveraged buy-out three years ago and has since been selling its assets, including seven television stations; Storer Cable is all that remains of the company. </TEXT></DOC>
