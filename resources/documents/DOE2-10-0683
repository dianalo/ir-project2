Thus the assignment ofthis band to the ammonium radical was confirmed. The lifetime of theupper state (3p/sup 2/F/sub 2/) was determined to be 4.2 ns, which ismuch shorter than ab initio values of the radiative lifetime, showingthat this state decays predominantly by predissociation. The Schusterband was not observed, neither after neutralization of ND/sub 4//sup+/, nor of ND/sub 3//sup +/.</TEXT></DOC>
