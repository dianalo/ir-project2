The April 8 vote also will prepare a new generation of leadersto take over after the aging Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini dies.   Hardliners, such as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, whohas close links to pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants holdingforeign hostages in Lebanon, are expected to make some gains.   Extremists have ``been coming out of the shadows in the lasteight months or so,'' said Gary Sick, a former U.S. NationalSecurity adviser who specializes in Iranian affairs.   ``They're certainly being heard and are more prominent now,'' hesaid in a telephone interview from his New York home. ``It's notclear how dominant a position they now have in the decision-makingprocess, but they have a tremendous impact and that could have aneffect on the elections.''   The candidates who will run for the 270-seat single-chamberMajlis, or Parliament, will not be campaigning on party tickets inthe Western style because there are no formal political parties inIran.   But they represent factions that reflect various shadings ofIslamic radicalism in a contest for control of Parliament, whichwill play an important role in the post-Khomeini era.   ``Any election in Iran is important,'' Sick said. ``The mostimportant thing is that the Iranians do have reasonably openelections.''   He added: ``There's always a certain amount of fixing, butconsidering they're in the middle of a war and all the in-fightingamong the hierarchy, it's interesting that they're having anelection at all.''   Membership of the Majlis, elected on a one-man, one-vote system,has become increasingly controlled by the regime and only approvedcandidates can run. About 20 million to 25 million people vote inIran.   The elections, the third since Khomeini's 1979 Islamicrevolution toppled the monarchy, will be held against a backdrop ofthe 7{-year-old war with Iraq, the growing international isolationof Khomeini's fundamentalist regime and worsening economic woes.   But the main issues, in public at least, will be land andindustrial reform, nationalization and social change.   Among the candidates announced so far are Parliament SpeakerHashemi Rafsanjani, hardline anti-American radical Hadi Ghafari,Mohammed Yazdi, a former central committee member of the nowdisbanded Islamic Republic Party.   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that the candidatesalso included, for the first time, 34 women, mainly from Tehran andthe northeastern city of Mashhad, one of the hotbeds ofrevolutionary Islam.   Rafsanjani, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, President AliKhamenei, and Chief Justice Ayatollah Mussavi Ardebeli, as heads ofidentifiable factions have been maneuvering for months to shape anddominate the next Majlis.   Khamenei, 48, is serving his second four-year term as presidentand is constitutionally barred from running again in the nextpresidential election in 1989.   His political base was seriously weakened last June whenKhomeini disbanded the Islamic Republic Party, which the presidentheaded.   Khomeini, 87 and reported in poor health, said he disbanded theparty, the vehicle used by Iran's clerics to seize political powerin the early days of the revolution, because it was riven byfactionalism.   Rafansjani, who also has strong support in the Majlis, islooking ahead to the presidential election and wants to replaceKhamenei with one of his allies.   With the non-Islamic elements who helped put Khomeini in powersytematically eliminated in bloody purges, the only oppositionparty permitted is the Freedom Movement, a tiny anti-war factionled by Mehdi Bazargan.   The veteran liberal politician was Iran's first post-revolutionprime minister. But he quit in protest against the storming of theU.S. embassy in November 1979 by Khomeini's loyalists.   Despite constant harrassment, he and his followers remain afaint voice of dissent.   The Majlis has wide constitutional powers, unlike therubber-stamp body it became under the late Shah Mohammed RezaPahlavi. But it has little decision-making power regarding theconduct of the war.   The Council of Guardians, a 13-member body dominated byconservative clerics, has blocked parliamentary efforts to pushthrough sweeping economic reforms, underlining the conflict betweenthe radicals, led by Musavi and others, and the more traditionalistfactions.   The traditionalist factions are linked to the ``Bazaaris,'' thewealthy merchant class who have survived under the revolution andwho retain considerable economic and political influence.   But Khomeini recently gave the Majlis, and the radicals, a majorboost with a series of edicts that widened state powers and controlof the war-battered economy.   Legislation on land reform and nationalization blocked by theCouncil will now be resubmitted to the Majlis and is likely to bebecome law.   ``This was a victory for the Majlis and the radicals over themore conservative forces,'' Sick commented. ``Without saying so,Khomeini's edicts changed the constitution. It wasn't coincidentalthat Khomeini issued these edicts before the elections.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed Blanche is The Associated Press' Middle Eastnews editor based in Nicosia and has covered Iranian affairs fortwo years.</TEXT></DOC>
