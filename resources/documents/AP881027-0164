(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Politicians have come to understand thatyou have to be pretty quick to a punch line to hold a crowd, and onThursday Dan Quayle fell victim _ for just a moment _ to anoverenthusiastic supporter.   In his stump speech, the Republican vice presidential candidateusually mentions that Michael Dukakis has linked himself to formerPresident Harry Truman. This gives Quayle a chance to parody LloydBentsen and poke some fun at himself by delivering the remark, ``Buthe's no Harry Truman.''   The reference is to Bentsen's debate putdown when Quayle comparedhis experience to that of President Kennedy _ Bentsen said he hadknown Kennedy and told Quayle, ``You're no Jack Kennedy.''   At a fund-raising breakfast, Quayle said Dukakis had beenreferring again to Truman, but before he could deliver the punchline, a man in the audience shouted out, ``He's no Harry Truman.''   That provoked laughter and left Quayle momentarily stymied. Buthe barely missed a beat before pointing to the man and said, ``Thatman, he doesn't know Michael Dukakis. He has never even served withMichael Dukakis, but he's right. Michael Dukakis is no HarryTruman.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Quayle shrugs off lingering questions about his National Guardservice as ``side events,'' but has not entirely escaped theVietnam-era issue.   Along with admirers as Quayle stumped through the South thisweek, there were naysayers. Signs reading ``Chickenhawk'' or ``WhyDid Quayle Cross The Road: To Get to the National Guard'' havegreeted him at rallies throughout the fall, and the resentment evenspilled over to a self-described Republican who served among hislocal police contingent in Miami on Wednesday.   The policeman told a reporter he'd intended to vote for GeorgeBush until Bush tapped Quayle as his running mate. Now, the officersaid, he will simply not vote on Nov. 8. He said he ``couldn'tbelieve'' he had to protect Quayle, whom he called ``a draftdodger.''   Quayle enlisted in the Indiana National Guard during the VietnamWar when many of his peers were being drafted. Quayle has said hewas not trying to avoid the draft, but simply chose a course thatwould allow him to attend law school while fulfilling his militaryobligation.</TEXT><TEXT>   At an earlier stop in Florida, Quayle let reporters know he hadnot forgotten the drubbing they gave him over his military service,his record as a mediocre student and other aspects of his background.   He was given a blue ``static jacket'' to wear during a tour of aTampa, Fla., Honeywell plant where highly sensitive components forthe Space Shuttle and Trident missile are made.   Outside, the Indiana senator still had the jacket on when headdressed a rally.   ``I was given this static jacket and I'm going to use it when Ihold my next news conference,'' joked the senator, who currentlyenjoys mostly friendly relations with the press and often comes backon the plane to chat with them.   Later, as he climbed the steps of his campaign plane, Quaylelaughed down at the reporters watching him from the tarmac and wavedthe jacket, pointing to them.   By the time most of the reporters came aboard from the back ofthe plane, the jacket was hanging from above the first row of pressseating.</TEXT><TEXT>   When Quayle arrived in Fort Lauderdale for a fund-raiser at theMarriott Hotel, many beachwear-clad people seemed startled at themotorcade whizzing through the sunny streets.   Two young men spun around as the motorcade pulled past them, andthey burst out laughing when they saw the open-backed stationwagonwith a TV news camera crew shooting the senator's car up ahead.   ``It's Elvis,'' one of the young men said to the other.</TEXT></DOC>
