The refugees were taken in two double-decker buses to the WestGerman border accompanied by West Germany's ambassador, HermanHuber. An additional 38 East Germans remained in the embassy andwere expected to leave for the West soon, embassy officials said.   On Thursday, the East German Embassy issued papers to therefugees allowing them to travel to a third country and formallyrevoked their East German citizenship, the East German state newsagency ADN reported. They were given 24 hours to leave the countryand the exodus began at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday.   Stripping them of their citizenship in Prague allowed therefugees to travel straight to West Germany, without having to passthrough their communist homeland.   On two previous occasions, several thousand East Germans in WestGermany's Prague embassy were allowed to leave but were taken bytrain through East German territory so that they could be formallyexpelled. However, this led to near riots by East Germans at homewanting to join the exodus.   About 15,000 East Germans have been allowed to leave afterseeking asylum in the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw,Poland.   West German government sources said about 1,800 East Germansremained in Warsaw and were awaiting similar arrangements to leavefor West Germany.   An estimated 60,000 East Germans fleeing political repression intheir homeland have arrived in West Germany in the past six weeksvia Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, which opened its borders toEast Germans on Sept. 10.</TEXT></DOC>
