RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a victory for the Reaganadministration and free-trade advocates, ruled today the governmentdoes not have to place restrictions on imported uranium to helpprotect domestic producers of the nuclear fuel.   The unanimous ruling overturned a decision barring federalofficials from enriching foreign uranium, particularly from Canadaand Australia, for import into the United States.   Administration officials had argued that the ban seriouslyjeopardized U.S. trade, nuclear cooperation and non-proliferationpolicies and could limit the supply of fuel used to run electricutility company nuclear reactors.   Today's decision reversed a ruling by the 10th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals based in Denver, which said last year that theDepartment of Energy must restrict enrichment of foreign uranim tosafeguard the deteriorating domestic industry.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the high court,said federal law does not require the department to restrictenrichment unless it is assured such action would maintain ``aviable domestic uranium industry.''   Federal officials have determined that the industry has not beenviable since 1983.   The industry has suffered in recent years with the decline ofnuclear power due to its high cost and concern over safetytriggered by the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor inPennsylvania.   The number of operating uranium mines in the United States hasdropped from 362 in 1979 to just three in 1986. The industry hasoperated at a loss over the last several years and imports haveaccounted for an increasing share of domestic requirements.   Federal energy officials say the U.S. uranium industry hascollapsed and the government is not required by law to prop it upby limiting imports.   In 1983, federal law was amended to require the secretary ofenergy to annually determine if the industry was viable. Thesecretary then determined the industry was not viable and the U.S.Trade Representative recommended no action be taken to restrictimport of uraniium.   Uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in itsnatural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionablematerial known as isotope U-235.   The enrichment process increases uranium's U-235 content fromless than 1 percent to 3 percent.   The government has a U.S. monopoly in providing enrichmentservices.   Federal officials said at least $300 million a year in fees forenrichment services was at stake in today's case.   Also, the Justice Department said restricting enriched uraniumfrom other countries could force up prices of electricity toconsumers here as supplies of the nuclear fuel dwindle.   The department said also at stake were U.S. trade relations withCanada and Australia, the major suppliers of uranium to his country.   Finally, U.S. officials said barring uranium imports could harmnuclear non-proliferation efforts because foreign supliers ofuranium likely would turn for enrichment services to other nationsthat do not have as strict a non-proliferation polcy as the UnitedStates.   Underscoring today's ruling are conflicts in Congress over therecently signed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. Theadministration recently has begun negotiating an alternative planin which the government would buy guaranteed amounts of domesticuranium.   But that plan, estimated to cost $750 million from 1989 to 1994,also faces stiff resistance from House leaders who say it would betoo costly to the taxpayers.   Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bill in March designed torevitalize the domestic uranium industry by imposing a schedule ofescalating fees on nuclear utilities that load their reactors withmore than 37.5 percent of foreign uranium.   That bill has run into stiff opposition in the House.   In today's case, the government was opposed by three U.S.uranium producers, Western Nuclear Inc., Energy Fuels Inc. andUranium Resources Inc.   The producers were supported by officials from Wyoming, NewMexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. They said their stateeconomies would be hurt by the collapse of the uranium industry.   The case is Huffman vs. Western Nuclear, 87-645.</TEXT></DOC>
