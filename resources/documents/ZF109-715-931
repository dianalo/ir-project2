 (See Release 1.0, 89-7, 90-2,90-3.)andP;  Or do you prefer to build your queries/search routines yourself, anddeal with the different flavor of each service?andP;  Wijit tries to make them alllook the same, but some are feeds -- where you get and pay for all the newsat a bulk rate in real-time and select some -- while others are databases,where you get responses to specific queries, and pay more per use but maybeless overall.andM;More questions: Do you want to integrate the information with otherelectronic data?andP;  First! offers convenient fax delivery and bulk rates forshared profiles (filters), but many of its large customers switch to e-mail;Desktop Data's NewsEDGE customers have asked for and gotten betterintegration of news feeds with their application environments.andP;  Finally,American Information Exchange (Release 1.0, 90-7), is targeted more to adhoc, one-time use, where you're looking for a specific piece of informationor even a custom piece of work.andP;  You tend to pay more, for information youwant more intensely, whereas the others are a continuing service.andP;  It's thedifference among a commuter ticket (First! or NewsEDGE), a car (Wijit orBeyond Mail; you still have to pay for gas...), and a one-time airplanecharter (AMIX).andP;  The Knowledge Network, below, assiduously avoids thetransportation analogies in favor of broadcasting, but suggests the analogyof an Official Airline Guide for frequent flyers -- choose what you want towatch.andM;C andamp; L'S Knowledge NetworkandM;How do you organize large bases of shared information?andP;  The natural responseis to try to stick it into a database, keep it orderly, and build carefulgroup-centered hierarchies and viewing forms, as with Lotus Notes.andP;  Butespecially when the information is changing rapidly, it may just be too muchfor a single administrative group, or a single orderly database, to manage.andO;And users may not have the skill or inclination to build Notes views andforms.andP;  Better to build a less-automated, self-organizing system that will doit by itself (even if there's a database underneath) -- in short, aninformation market.andM;But instead of taking the market notion to its full (cf.andP;  AmericanInformation Exchange; Release 1.0, 90-7), Coopers andamp; Lybrand and its partnerReach Networks have chosen the quasi-market model of television and media --where success is measured in ratings -- rather than the more common metaphorsof information highways, libraries or utilities or information refineries.andO;(Those ratings translate into dollars of resources and funding eventually,but the individual users don't pay from their own pockets.andP;  When the systemis eventually rolled out to Candamp;L customers, or implemented by other Reachclient firms, that may change.andP;  Then the model might be pay-per-view...)andM;Designed and implemented by Reach Networks, a 10-person firm in New YorkCity, the system is called the Knowledge Network and currently has 1700users, or about 40 percent of Candamp;L's 4000-odd partners and managers.andP;  Thatamounts to 90 percent of those who have computers in their offices, and about600 different users log on each day.andP;  has everything in B and more; both arethe same.andP;  The initial goal is to get from the first state to one of theintermediate ones.andP;  (The system still can't recognize the same appointment atdifferent times -- e.g.andP;  lunch with Juan andamp; Alice -- as being the same event;and of course maybe it isn't.andP;  Nor does it, as HandyWidget would, realizethat Juan and JT may be the same person.andP;  Either way, these are conflictsthat have to be reconciled.)andM;This can be done by day, by week, or by month.andP;  The system has simple,appropriate menu picks: add the item from A to B; delete the item; move it;and so forth.andP;  You can also add all the A-only items from A to B, and soforth.andP;  It's all very simple, easy to understand, and not too automatic.andP;  Theuser is still in control.andP;  Longer term, you may want to automatically add allitems from A to B, and flag only if there are time conflicts.andP;  You can sothis, and still flag all the new appointments.andP;  All this can be tailored toreflect the way you work with your secretary, or with a travel and astationary calendar.andM;Obviously, this is an approach that can be scaled up, gently, to manage thereconciliation of a group schedule on a server with the calendars of groupmembers.andP;  This capability is available now; long run, the same functionality,based on manipulation of Paradox files, could easily be moved across to otherareas, such as intelligent reconciliation of address books.andP;  How often haveyou changed an address in one place, only to have the old one turn up yearslater in some other place?andP;  (For example, we still get mail for ComputerIndustry Daily, which died in 1985.andP;  It's from people who know better, buttheir personal calendars never talked to their corporate databases.)andM;Managing agendas, not actionsandM;In the context of groupware overall, Sidekick is an information managerrather than a workflow tool: The meetings are shared information rather thanobligations the system knows about.andP;  Meetings are scheduled by posting themtentatively to someone else's (public) schedule, and then confirmed by thesecond person; then the meeting is listed as confirmed in the proposer'sschedule.andP;  All this is through the medium of Paradox applications and filesrather than the e-mail messages that could achieve the same results in Wijitor Beyond Mail.andP;  Of course, you can build your own Paradox applications orcall the Paradox engine through DDE to generate custom reports or queries orapplications on the data in the schedules or the phone books.andP;  However, thereis no easy way to extend the tools as you can do with semi-structuredmessages in Beyond Mail or Wijit.andP;  (Sidekick does not have e-mail or an APIthat would make it easy to manipulate through Beyond Mail or Wijit.)andM;Sidekick starts in a small, easily understandable domain, but it is theprecursor to more.andP;  These are the kinds of things you have to resolve firstin dealing with group interactions.andP;  As we progress, we will find thatsoftware consists more and more of agglomerations of special-purpose tasks.andO;The trick will be to add them in an integrated fashion.andP;  For now, forexample, you can paste someone's name into the calendar, but if you point atthe name in a calendar entry, it has to do a full-text search to find it inthe address book; it is not linked.andP;  This means that you need to do afull-text search the other way to find all your appointments with Fred, orall your meetings in Tucson.andP;  That is, you can create objects on the fly, butthey don't yet really exist within the system.andM;The assumption was that people in the same practice would have similarinterests, and would want to &quot;read&quot; a &quot;channel&quot; devoted to that practice.andO;People within a practice take on the responsibility of producing weekly&quot;shows&quot; (news reports), with financial support from headquarters for outsidewriters.andP;  They promise the firm guaranteed subscriber levels in return forthe sponsorship (just as the networks do to their sponsors).andP;  Shows with poorratings ultimately get canceled, as has happened a couple of times at Candamp;L, tosuch shows as a weekly report on government economic releases.andM;The initial pilot went quite well, to an audience of 100information/communications partners, using a UNIX box as a server and pcs asclients.andP;  The system now runs on Sun servers, and still uses pc clients.andP;  Infact, the clients aren't even Windows-based; they use character graphics,with menus and dialogue boxes that make the system friendly andunintimidating rather than glitzy and high-tech.andP;  The technology is quitesimple and practical: Like a mail system, it hides the complexities ofcommunications, data transfer and remote procedure calls from users,requiring them only to select items and commands from the screen, and to postdata simply by selecting it or by naming a DOS file.andP;  Those who use it pickedit up with no training.andM;The media moguls behind it all....andP;  Project instigator Andy Zimmerman mayhave been especially receptive to the television/media model because he spenttwo years at RCA/Columbia before being wooed back to Candamp;L by Bob Kavnershortly before Kavner decamped for ATandamp;T.andP;  Zimmerman had started in thetelecommunications consulting practice at Candamp;L, and worked on electronicinformation services when he returned.andP;  He met Reach's Doug Kester in 1985when Kester was at Yankelovich, Skelly andamp; White and the two men workedtogether on a marketing study of electronic information services.andP;  WhenKester went out on his to build such a service and create Reach Networks,Zimmerman and Candamp;L became his first, and still most important, client.andO;Co-founder Christian Stumm, the technical visionary, was an economist andfinancial consultant turned software developer.andP;  They took television/mediaas their user model, and the Internet, the nationwide government-fundednetwork, as their technical model.andP;  Kester and Stumm each own 50 percent ofthe firm.andM;Good demographics!andM;But to make the easy-to-use point with ratings rather than words, Zimmermancites some figures: The audience is partners and managers, not computerfolks, he notes, and 25 percent of them are over 50 years old.andP;  For the firmas a whole, the average age of a partners is 44, and so is the average age ofthe Knowledge Network users.andP;  A third of the partners in tax and computerauditing say it has played an important role in generating revenues (inresponse to an electronic survey administered through the Network, ofcourse).andP;  Forty percent of viewers of a series intended to encouragecross-selling of services from consulting to auditing and tax, said that theseries had been effective.andP;  Roughly half of the viewers of an outside taxnews service said they had used it to solve a client problem or keep a clientinformed.andM;As noted, Zimmerman has all the interest of an obsessive tv executive in theratings -- which amount to that elusive goal of technology executives,measurement of the benefits.andP;  How many people watched?andP;  How many peoplepressed F2 (to get further information)?andP;  Users can vote after they'vefinished reading a show.andP;  Topics range from the relevant (&quot;Tax issues arisingfrom the budget compromise&quot;) to the riveting (&quot;Considerations when preparinga partnership tax return&quot;).andP;  But we prefer anecdotes: The deputy chairman whofirst backed the project retired this year, says Zimmerman.andP;  He is now 62,and he still uses the system from his home.andM;Media, not multi-mediaandM;Although the structure is media and the approach is show-biz, the KnowledgeNetwork is focused on content rather than multi-media.andP;  The system comprisesa large text base, but users generate the text and decide what they want tosee.andP;  In other words, the company left most of the structure and selection ofinformation up to the users, rather than trying to automate the constructionof a possibly too-rigid information model.andP;  Users simply choose what theywant to see from a menu, just as television viewers do.andM;Users are encouraged to produce shows -- which are up-to-the-week orup-to-the-day reports classified by practice area, written by outside writersfor &quot;clarity, wit and bubbliness.&quot;andP;  Rather than the user doing a text search,the producers of each channel set the agenda, determining what it's importantfor subscribers to know -- much as a newspaper shapes its coverage andhighlights stories on the front page, or a network leads its nightly news(usually with a story with good visuals); see Release 1.0, 90-2.andM;The information is presented as an electronic slide show of text (10 slideswould be typical), which is easier to read than scrolling.andP;  There are fourmajor services: Focus, customized shows for various practice areas; Trades,reprints (with royalties) and abstracts from outside publishers such as theBureau of National Affairs and the Harvard Business Review; news feeds fromUPI, PR News, DowVision and Reuters; Discuss, issue-oriented bulletin boards;and Mail, for direct, private communication with other users or outside thesystem to customers (via e-mail, fax, or printer).andP;  You can't annotate itemsin Focus or Trades directly, but you can copy them and send them out throughDiscuss or Mail with your comments.andP;  The REACH technology also provideselectronic forms within shows for such tasks as ordering a full-text printoutor responding to surveys.andM;Viewers are profiled demographically -- in Candamp;L's case by region, practice,job title, task-force assignments, etc.andP;  REACH maintains a matrix of whoshould see what, and then manages notification whenever a new show is aired,so that each user can see what is available that he hasn't yet read.andP;  It'shis option to read it, delete it, or store it for later (re)viewing.andP;  Thisallows the system to compile ratings -- although just as with tv ratings, youcan't determine the degree of someone's interest or attention.andM;Behind the scenesandM;REACH uses two databases.andP;  The regular system information -- user profiles,usage reports, and pointers to and information about the text base itself --is kept in Informix, with the documents pointed to by Informix.andP;  The systemalso holds a large, in-memory &quot;database&quot; on the server (using vectors andsuch) so that it knows in real-time each user's filters and what he has andhasn't seen (just as phone companies keep forwarding numbers and other suchdata in memory; cf.andP;  Nucleus, 88-1).andP;  As a user pages through his system, hismenu immediately displays the appropriate selection of shows, properly taggedfor whether or not he has seen them.andP;  The extra dot next to &quot;Solutions...&quot;andO;(across) indicates that the user hasn't yet seen this show.andM;Reach's technology includes a News Engine, which classifies news storiesalong the lines of NewsEDGE, First! or Third Eye (see Release 1.0, 88-1).andO;Reach chose to build its own indexing and comparison engine, although it usesthe same similarity-ranking approach based on the classic work of Cornell'sGerard Salton as the others (except Verity, which is based on topichierarchies, and Reuters' classification scheme, which uses rules).andP;  However,says Stumm, &quot;We don't see the value of going the last mile; we do just enoughwork to get useful classifications, not perfect ones [if there could be sucha thing].andP;  At Cornell they had one graduate student too many.&quot;andM;Notes on market positioningandM;In terms of what it can accomplish, REACH's closest competitor is certainlyLotus Notes (although technically it may be closer to CompuServe).andP;  From amarket/economic perspective, both make sense only for large groups, unlikethe mail tools assessed above.andP;  But the flavor of Notes is quite differentfrom that of Knowledge Network.andP;  &quot;Groupware is introverted; we'reextroverted,&quot; says Candamp;L's Zimmerman.andP;  &quot;We're trying to reach out acrosspractice barriers within the firm, and to clients outside the firm.&quot;andM;Although there is ample peer-to-peer information-sharing, REACH has the feelof television, with shows professionally produced, whereas Notes is closer toa bulletin board, with facilities for annotation throughout, and with a moregranular structure to its information, with tables and outlines.andP;  Notes ismore of an information management tool, with facilities for applicationdevelopment, while the Knowledge Network is really a publishing medium, withthe information management mostly left to broadcasters (and the financialcontrols to their sponsors).andP;  Notes probably works best with tight groupsfocused on specific tasks, even though the most visible placement hascertainly been the approaching-10,000 installation at Candamp;L competitor PriceWaterhouse.andP;  (Pricing is more like a service, $50 to $200 per person per yearfor large groups, rather than a software package such as Notes, which costsabout $300 per person, starting at $62,500 for 200 units.)andM;In the long run, Reach's aim is to let its customers broadcast to theirclients as well.andP;  While that's the aim of Notes too, we see REACH as amarketing tool, whereas Notes would be a collaboration tool, where companieswork together on a project.andP;  In the end, as with Wijit vs.andP;  Beyond Mail, youcould more or less create either system with the other (although Notes iscertainly more programmable), but each has its own flavor.andM;Over all, the REACH system isn't technically grandiose (although there's beena lot of attention to plumbing, as with Notes).andP;  It doesn't organize theinformation in any grand scheme (hierarchical or object-oriented); it doesn'tuse natural language or message parsing or fancy tree structures.andP;  But itworks.andP;  Ad hoc or no, it gets information out to people who can use it; it'smore important that the information be seen than that it be perfectlyorganized.andP;  Users find out more than they might otherwise, and theycommunicate it to clients and colleagues.andM;&quot;Imagine what the television industry would have been like had home videodeveloped before network television.andP;  The family TV set would have VCR andcamera attachments but no link to the outside world.andP;  It would remain for afuture generation of Sarnoffs, Paleys and Turners to come up with the idea ofa network that turns these free-standing boxes into a vital communicationsmedium....andP;  There are now over 40 million desktop computers in the US alone,and most of them are not connected to anything beyond the office down thehall.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
