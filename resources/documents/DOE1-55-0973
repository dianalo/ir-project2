The stimulus consistedof 12 sectors of a hemicircle, 6 foveal and 6 peripheral out to about17 degrees visual field angle. The sectors flashed individually for 63milliseconds with an inter-stimulus-interval between .8 and 1.8 seconds.The recording computer was synchronized to the stimulus and recordedfor .5 seconds after onset of stimulus. Thirty averages were taken foreach stimulus section, for each of about 45 grid points on the scalp.The sectors were localized to distinct points in the primary visual cortex(area 17). The results did not verify the cruciform model of retinotopicmapping nor the theory that more visually eccentric stimuli produce deeperresponses. The data seem to suggest and different type of mapping forfoveal stimuli than peripheral, but this could also be due to the foldstructure of the primary visual cortex.</TEXT></DOC>
