McMullen andamp; John F. McMullen, 12/1/89andM;REVIEWandM;With a good deal of fanfare and a massive marketing effort, the Prodigyon-line service has recently been made available to Macintosh users.andM;Unlike Compuserve, GENIE, MCI and the other online services, Prodigy, as agraphics-based system, requires special customized software to be utilizedand for a while, it was even doubtful as to whether a Macintosh interfacewould be provided (Prodigy is a joint venture of Sears and IBM and it did notseem likely to some that IBM would be happy about proving Macintoshsoftware).andM;The announcement of Prodigy availability for the Macintosh was accompanied byan all-out assault on Macintosh User Groups by Prodigy personnel to announcethe software and solicit membership.andP;  In New York, for instance, Prodigysalespersons spoke to both the Big Apple User Group and the New YorkMacintosh User Group within a 2 week period.andP;  In both cases, they weresuccessful in enlisting members.andM;The membership drive included an introductory offer under which the userreceives the Macintosh software free along with two months free service.andP;  Theon-going cost of the service is $9.95 per month for unlimited usage (purchaseof items through the shopping services, of course, add cost as does the useof the Manufacturers Hanover online banking service; all other charges arecovered in the $9.95.andM;When one initially signs on to Prodigy from a Macintosh, instant admirationfor both the content of the system and its presentation is inevitable.andP;  Thesystem uses graphics extensively both in its informational displays (eforexample, the weather map is beautiful) and in the advertisements thatconstantly move across the screen (the ads are tasteful and well done and didnot, in our case, cause annoyance -- it is, after all, their presence thatkeeps the rates low).andM;In just a short time of use, it becomes apparent that the service contains agreat deal of useful information and opinion.andP;  Computer gurus Stewart Alsopand Larry Magid are featured on the service as are political columnistsRobert Novak and Jack Germond, sports columnist Dick Schaap, movie criticsGene Siskert and Marilyn Beck and financial writers Sylvia Porter and JulianBlock, to name but a few.andM;Dow Jones market information (with the 15 minute delay mandated by the NewYork Stock Exchange) is contained on Prodigy as is up to the minute sportsresults by team.andM;In short, the Prodigy system is impressive and well worth the price.andP;  Thenegatives? The system, due to graphics processing, is much slower than usersof other services would expect.andP;  If it were not for the fact that there is noadditional costs beyond the $9.95 monthly charge, it would be easy to suspectinefficiency with a profit motive.andM;Additionally, the software, while providing for printing of material receivedfrom the system, does not support capturing of information to disk forreading and/or analyzing at a later time.andP;  As longtime on- line serviceusers, we feel the absence of these features to be very annoying.andP;  Even withthese objections, however, we feel Prodigy has quite a bit to offer and werecommend its trial.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE: 2.5.andP;  The software itself is very well done.andP;  The limitation isthe speed.andM;USEFULNESS: 3.5.andP;  The only problem is the inability to capture to disk orsend things from disk in the electronic mail section.andM;MANUAL: 3.andP;  Not much supplied, but not much required.andM;AVAILABILITY: 4.andP;  Very high grades.andP;  The customer service department iscurrently providing adequate support.andP;  Availability of the front- endsoftware package is everywhere.andM;(Barbara E.
