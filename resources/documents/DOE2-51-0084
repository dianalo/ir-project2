Efforts to purify this acid-stable cytochromec have been hampered by two factors: (1) the protein behaves like a typicalmembrane-associated protein in that it appears to aggregate quite stronglywith other membrane proteins in the preparation; and (2) the concentrationof this cytochrome is never that great in crude extracts of {ital T.ferrooxidans}. The former property makes it difficult to disaggregateand purify the individual proteins while retaining the desired biologicalactivity. The latter property dictates that the majority of the purificationeffort be directed toward actually growing a sufficient mass of the chemolithotrophicbacterium to supply ample quantities of crude extract. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
