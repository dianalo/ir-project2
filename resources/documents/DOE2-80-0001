Thermal energy with compression produces fusionof separated arterial wall layers, and heat appears to alter the elasticrecoil of the vessel wall. Radiofrequency (RF) thermal energy has beenused to perform vascular anastomoses and thermal angioplasty. A simplein vivo experiment was designed to describe and quantitate vascular tissueweld strength produced by a range of RF thermal energy levels. Caninecarotid arteries were compressed between a pair of modified bipolar forcepsthat applied RF energy, causing occlusive tissue welds between the apposedintimal surfaces. The strength of the welds was evaluated by measuringthe perfusion pressure required to reopen the vessel lumen. A dosimetryrange of 0 to 205 joules showed a typical dose-response curve for therelationship between energy applied and bond strength, plateauing atapproximately 300 mm Hg. Light microscopy showed fusion of the innersurfaces of the vessel with preservation of vessel wall architecture.Additionally inflation of a bipolar RF balloon catheter in the normalcanine carotid lumen produced an alteration of vessel profile angiographicallyand histologically. Results of these preliminary experiments suggestthat balloon angioplasty with adjunctive RF thermal energy may have benefitsin reducing the factors causing acute failure of conventional percutaneoustransluminal balloon angioplasty.</TEXT></DOC>
