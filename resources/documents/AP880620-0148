Honecker called for ``mechanisms for the peaceful discussion ofcrises and for the prevention of military incidents.''   ``For example, perhaps there could be a hotline between Prague,Berlin and Bonn,'' Honecker said.   Delegates from 110 countries are attending the three-dayconference in East Berlin that began Monday.   Among the delegates are U.S. peace activists, West Germanpoliticians, officials from the Warsaw Pact, Palestine LiberationOrganization leader Yassir Arafat, and Chedli Klibi,general-secretary of the Arab League.   Honecker has been a strong proponent of a European nuclearweapons-free zone, and arranged the conference. He said in hisopening address that such a zone would ``lessen the militaryconfrontation in Europe.''   But many NATO leaders including West German Chancellor HelmutKohl reject the idea, saying Western Europe would still beendangered by Warsaw Pact troops outside such a corridor and bySoviet nuclear forces.   West Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union andChristian Social Union parties, coalition partners in the federalgovernment, turned down invitations to the conference.   But invitations were accepted by the Free Democrats, juniorpartners in the coalition, and by West Germany's opposition SocialDemocrats and Greens parties.   Piotr Demichev, Soviet Communist Party Politburo candidate andthe Kremlin's representative at the East Berlin meeting, read aletter from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev addressed to theconference.   Quoting Gorbachev, Demichev said the Soviet Union fully supportssetting up a nuclear-free zone in central Europe.   ``The Soviet Union is ready ... to give up its status as anuclear power as soon as possible,'' Demichev said.   ``But as long as we have this status, we are ready for radicalreductions and its practical forms. This includes support forestablishing nuclear-free zones,'' Demichev said, reading fromGorbachev's letter.</TEXT></DOC>
