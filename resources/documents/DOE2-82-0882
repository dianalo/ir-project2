Heat transferand pressure drop were measured in a 150 mm (ID) column with a 610-mmbed of metal Pall rings. Molten nitrate salt and preheated air were theworking fluids with a salt inlet temperature of approximately 440{degree}Cand air inlet temperatures of approximately 230{degree}C. A comparisonbetween the experimental data and the heat transfer model is made onthe basis of heat transfer from the salt. For the range of air and saltflow rates tested, 0.3 to 1.2 kg/m{sup 2} s air flow and 6 to 18 kg/m{sup2} s salt flow, the data agree with the model within 22% standard deviation.In addition, a model for the column pressure drop was validated, agreeingwith the experimental data within 18% standard deviation over the rangeof column pressure drop from 40 to 1250 Pa/m. 25 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
