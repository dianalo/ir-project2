Under the plan, Alaska Air said it will pay commissions to brokerages that will buy the shares and resell them in lots of 100 shares or more on the open market. The plan is designed to reduce the number of odd-lot holders, thereby reducing the airline concern's administrative and mailing costs. </TEXT></DOC>
