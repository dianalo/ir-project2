(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The utility that operates the RanchoSeco nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the powerstation that voters decided to close.   The 3-2 decision Tuesday by the Sacramento Municipal UtilityDistrict to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of theactivists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, whichhas a history of operating problems.   The board majority argued that the June 6 ballot measure in whichthe electorate decided to close the plant doesn't forbid someoneelse from runnning it.   The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the $200 millionto $300 million cost of shutting it down, said Joseph Buonaiuto,board president.   Voters earlier this month decided in a non-binding referendum toclose the plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it isunsafe and uneconomical, and a majority of the utility board agreedto abide by the outcome.   The plant was taken out of service June 7, and so far about 400contract workers have lost their jobs.   Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has saidit will sue to stop the transfer of Rancho Seco to businesses thatmight continue to operate it.   ``We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period,'' saidMichael Remy, an lawyer with the group. ``Our position still is thatenough is enough.''   The plant, 25 miles southeast of Sacramento, has operated at 39percent of capacity over its 15-year life.   Quadrex, a nuclear power consulting company in Campbell, Calif.,has said it is interested in taking over the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
