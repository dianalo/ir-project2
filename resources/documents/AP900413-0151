Horticulturist Mark S. Roh of the department's AgriculturalResearch Service said a special treatment has been developed which``brings a lily from a very small bulb to bloom in about 280 daysinstead of two to three years. And in living colors, not justtraditional white.''   He said the hybrid lily colors include red, creamy yellow andbright lavender flowers on 12- to 25-inch stems.   The new procedure bypasses the field production of liliesaltogether, allowing them to undergo forced controlled growth ingreenhouses to reduce major viruses and soil-borne fungal diseasesthat plague field-grown lilies.   Roh said in a report by the agency that he plans to formallyrelease the hybrid lilies to nurseries this year.   ``When the method is commercialized, a company would probablyoffer the treated bulbils, or small bulbs, to nurseries that wouldin turn produce potted plants or cut flowers for consumers,'' thereport said.   U.S. growers sold more than 9 million potted lilies in 1988 at awholesale value of more than $34 million, according to the mostrecent USDA figures.</TEXT></DOC>
