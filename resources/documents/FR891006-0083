Box 2327, Elkins, West Virginia 26241has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1105 (housingof underground transformer stations, battery-charging stations, substations,compressor stations, shops, and permanent pumps) to its Mine No. 1A (I.D.No. 46-06715) located in Randolph County, West Virginia. The petition isfiled under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that underground permanent pumpsbe housed in fireproof structures or areas, and air currents used to ventilatestructures or areas enclosing electrical installations be coursed directlyinto the return.2. The pump is located in a sump area and contains a walkway used for pumpinspection, a permanent overhead monorail used for pump installation, andlimited space between the sump and the trolley wire.3. These conditions would make permanent housing difficult and reduce theeffectiveness of housing if installed.4. Due to adverse water conditions, which have been a major problem, thepump is highly utilized and an important part of dewatering. An attemptto relocate the pump or alterations to the present area could alter thewater flow.5. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to place a dry chemicalfire extinguisher within the area. This would provide immediate firefightingequipment should a fire occur. The location of the pump is frequently passedby incoming and putgoing personnel, supply shipments, and routine man tripsand any fire would be readily detected.6. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforeded by thestandard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
