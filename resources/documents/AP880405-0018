Letters signed by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, LaborSecretary Ann McLaughlin and Secret Service Director John R.Simpson are among 62 attached to a defense brief that urges a shortterm of unsupervised probation for Nofziger.   In a three-page letter, Herrington urged U.S. District JudgeThomas Flannery to show ``compassion and understanding'' forNofziger.   ``Society has been paid by what he has gone through in thistrial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual,''Herrington said.   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., one of four members of Congress who sentletters, urged Flannery to consider ``balancing the requirements ofjustice with the quality of mercy.''   Simpson wrote about Nofziger's role as White House spokesman onMarch 30, 1981, after President Reagan had been shot and taken toGeorge Washington University Hospital.   ``Once Mr. Nofziger took the podium,'' Simpson recalled, hequickly became aware ``of the rapport and the trust the press hadfor any statements he made.''   Nofziger, 63, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday on threecounts of illegally lobbying former White House colleagues onbehalf of Wedtech Corp., the manufacturer of the A-10 anti-tankplane, and a maritime engineers union.   He could receive a two-year prison term and a $10,000 fine foreach of the three felony violations of the Ethics in Government Act.   Last week, independent counsel James C. McKay urged a prisonterm of unspecified length and a fine, arguing that Nofzigerflouted the law and was unrepentant following his conviction Feb.11.   Nofziger had likened his crime to ``running a stop sign.''   The defense brief that was filed Monday said imprisonment``would unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation Mr.Nofziger has already suffered as a result of his indictment andtrial.''   Accusing McKay of making a ``vindictive'' and ``mean-spirited''sentencing request, defense lawyers Robert Plotkin and E. LawrenceBarcella said ``it is inconceivable that a sentence other thanprobation is appropriate under these circumstances.''   Former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., said Nofziger ``has been deeplywounded and punished _ physically, emotionally and financially.''   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., called Nofziger ``a man ofimpeccable character and integrity'' who would ``never do anythingwhich he understood to be morally wrong.''   Others who signed letters were Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., Rep.Mervyn W. Dymally, D-Calif., and former Health and Human ServicesSecretary Margaret Heckler, now U.S. ambassador to Ireland;   Former U.S. Treasurer Angela Buchanan; Joe Rodgers, U.S.ambassador to France; and Carol Boyce Hallett, the ambassador tothe Bahamas.   The defense brief repeated a longstanding contention thatNofziger didn't intend to violate the post-employment lobbyingrestrictions, a point hotly disputed by McKay's sentencing memo.   Nofziger ``does not dispute the need for fair, clear andbalanced post-employment restriction'' but, his lawyers contended,if the statute were clearer he ``likely would not be before thecourt for sentencing.''</TEXT></DOC>
