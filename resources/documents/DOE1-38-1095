Theenergy section of the Agreement is one of its most important. Energytrade between the US and Canada amounts to over $10 billion per year,the largest such bilateral trade in the world. Canada is our largestoil supplier and provides virtually all of our natural gas and electricityimports. While these volumes are a small fraction of US needs, they providean important margin of energy security. Canada also is an important marketfor US energy exports, buying 16 million tons or $700 million worth ofcoal in 1987, 20% of US coal exports. The Free Trade Agreement ensuresthat the US and Canada can continued to enjoy unrestricted trade in energy,provides benefits to US consumers and producers, and enhances our energysecurity. The Agreement: prohibits future restrictions on energy trade,such as quantitative restriction, import or export taxes, and minimumprices; ensures that US consumers will be treated equitably with Canadianconsumers; provides added assurance of supply in the event of disruptions;will lower costs to consumers, including our energy intensive industries,and help make US industry more competitive in world markets; will providemore certainty to producers and consumers, which should expand energytrade and be more conducive to energy investment; and will, over time,reduce US oil imports by encouraging continued market penetration ofCanadian and US natural gas, and greater use of Canadian hydroelectricpower.</TEXT></DOC>
