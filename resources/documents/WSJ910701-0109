All this coincideswith a growing realization that South Africa is a much morecomplex country than most Americans previously thought, andthat future U.S. policy should reflect that fact.   Evidence of a new political sophistication in Americanthinking about South Africa became clear when MangosuthuButhelezi, chief of the Zulu nation, visited the U.S.recently. Mr. Buthelezi heads the pro-Western Inkhata FreedomParty, whose 1.9 million members make it the largestpolitical group in South Africa -- nearly four times as largeas the African National Congress, which has some 500,000members.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Buthelezi had lunch with President Bush and wasreceived respectfully by Members of Congress. His message wasthat South Africa must develop a politics of pluralism andnot merely replace the entrenched rule of one group with thatof another. Lifting economic sanctions, he believes, willhelp South Africa spur its stagnant economy and buymuch-needed time for the country's many ethnic groups tonegotiate a new constitution.   Meanwhile, the ANC's most avid supporters in the U.S.again dismissed Mr. Buthelezi as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; and a tool ofthe white regime, ignoring the fact that he was a valued allyof the ANC until 1976, when he refused to countenance itscampaign of violence. Media commentary about Mr. Buthelezi,however, has become more varied. The Atlanta Constitutionchided that city's black leaders for snubbing him. CourtlandMilloy, a columnist for the Washington Post, noted that SouthAfrica will only prosper if both Nelson Mandela and Mr.Buthelezi play a role in its future. &quot;In Buthelezi's view,blacks should ease their way into the South African economicmainstream and try to assuage the fears of whites as much aspossible,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In that regard, Buthelezi is to Mandelawhat Booker T. Washington was to W.E.B. DuBois. BlackAmericans should realize that both men have somethingimportant to offer their diverse followings.&quot;   Indeed, the only way South Africa will become amulti-racial democracy is if negotiations include allelements of its population. Instead, a campaign of violenceand intimidation threatens to remove legitimate players fromthe negotiating table, leaving only the ANC and thediscredited white regime. Any deal they may strike bythemselves will be unstable and likely result in disaster.   A new study by South Africa's respected Institute of RaceRelations reports that more than one million blacks were&quot;intimidated or coerced&quot; into taking part in consumer or rentboycotts in the past year against their will. Much of thecountry is becoming ungovernable. The white regime hasresponded by quietly working with the ANC to set upalternative power structures that freeze out non-ANC blacks.The first &quot;community dispute resolution centers&quot; opened inblack townships last month. The organizers are almostentirely members of ANC-front groups. Many blacks fear thatsuch centers may herald the return of the infamous ANC&quot;people's courts&quot; that intimidated opponents in much the waythe Nicaraguan Sandinistas did when they took power. HernusKriel, the white minister for provincial affairs, justifieshis working solely with ANC supporters on the grounds that&quot;it is easier to go to one meeting&quot; than to work with avariety of groups.   The ANC itself is still a mixture of black nationalistsand fanatical Marxists for whom communism's collapse hasdictated a change in tactics but not ideology. This week theANC will hold its first internal congress in 30 years inDurban. Among the honored guests will be PLO leader YassirArafat, Cuba's foreign minister and senior Libyan diplomats.   Concern over the ANC's anti-democratic tendencies isgrowing. Last month, the U.S. House voted 279 to 134 to denyU.S. aid to &quot;the Communist Party of South Africa or anyaffiliated or associated organization.&quot; That would includethe ANC; it is in a formal alliance with the SACP and atleast half of its executive committee members are Communists.   If President Bush does end most sanctions he will signalthat the U.S. wants to encourage the democratic process andnot merely follow the ANC's agenda. The interests of SouthAfrica's diverse peoples will be served only if all of themare free to participate without fear in the discussions overtheir country's future.</TEXT></DOC>
