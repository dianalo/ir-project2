Having told the world for 2{ years the Soviets would let theirEast bloc partners set their own political courses, PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev is now demonstrating he meant what he said.   Gorbachev's 1987 pledge was met with skepticism fromCzechoslovakia to Washington, but he has reiterated andstrengthened his position as he developed his ``new thinking'' inforeign policy and promoted his concept of a ``common Europeanhome'' for all nations on the continent.   Western analysts first saw the proposal as a tactic to isolatethe United States from NATO allies in Western Europe, but it now isapparent Gorbachev wants to draw back the Iron Curtain to give theEast access to more prosperous Western markets and a security builton common interests rather than military deterrence.   The Soviet Union crushed reform movements in Hungary in 1956 andin Czechoslovakia in 1968 and backed the Polish government'scrackdown on Solidarity in 1981.   But Gorbachev discarded the so-called ``Brezhnev Doctrine,''which justified intervention in restive Communist satellites toprevent any retreat from socialism.   The Kremlin once would have seen reforms like those in Hungary,which is moving toward a multi-party democracy, or in East Germany,which threw open its borders to the West, as impermissible threatsto its ideological grip on its Warsaw Pact allies.   But Gorbachev has espoused variety in socialism. Since he cameto power in March 1985, he has been taking ideology out ofrelations with both East and West.   ``Each country has its own specifics, and foreign partiesdetermine their political course with due regard for nationalconditions,'' he said during an April 1987 visit to Prague,Czechoslovakia.   He expanded on the theme seven months later.   ``Unity does not mean being identical or uniform,'' he said inMoscow. ``We have also become convinced that socialism does not,and cannot, have a model with which all (socialist systems) arecompared.''   ``New thinking,'' as Gorbachev has defined it, means Sovietforeign policy is based on mutual respect among nations, and he hasabandoned the traditional Communist line that it is the duty ofCommunist countries to sponsor and support like-minded revolutionselsewhere.   He told the United Nations in December there can be ``unity indiversity.''   ``If we assert this politically, if we reaffirm our adherence tofreedom of choice, then there is no room for the view that somelive on Earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quiteby chance,'' he said.   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the glib Soviet Foreign Ministryspokesman, has dubbed the new approach to relations with EasternEurope the ``Sinatra Doctrine,'' named for singer Frank Sinatra,whose signature song boasts, ``I did it my way.''   There are risks in unleashing the allies who since World War IIhave formed a buffer between the Soviet Union and Western Europe,but the Kremlin cannot afford to continue propping up its partnersmilitarily and economically with its own economy in shambles.   Gorbachev has pursued disarmament and cut military expenditures,unilaterally withdrawing troops from Eastern Europe and Asia. Hehas focused on putting the Soviet Union's political and economichouses in order and has encouraged his allies to do the same.   The risk of Gorbachev's hands-off policy is that the SovietUnion will lose its front-line defenses in East Germany andelsewhere, exposing itself to another devastating land war like thetwo suffered so far this century. The Kremlin has made it clear,therefore, that its tolerance for reform does not extend to theredrawing of national boundaries and, particularly, thereunification of Germany.   The East bloc countries face a deadline of sorts for joining theworld economic community. The scheduled integration of WesternEurope's economies in 1992 threatens to widen the already obviousgap between the standards of living in Eastern and Western Europe.   As ideological barriers fall, help could come from Westerncountries that have been reluctant to lend a hand to the repressiveregimes they considered a threat to their own security and progress.   The role of the West in helping encourage development in thehard-pressed East bloc countries is expected to be discussed nextmonth when President Bush meets Gorbachev. Bush said thefast-moving developments in East Germany give the meeting ``evenmore importance.'' Bush has said he wants to learn from Gorbachevabout the ``dynamic change'' in Eastern Europe.   Gerasimov said the meeting ``can just be the end of the ColdWar.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Andrew Katell has been a Moscow correspondent ofThe Associated Press since February 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
