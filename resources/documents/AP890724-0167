The old currency must be traded for the new by Aug. 3. It willbe without value after that deadline.   Monday was the first day of business since the governmentannounced Saturday the currency would be replaced in a move to curbforgery, smuggling and black marketeering.   The oficials reported ``scenes of panic'' at banks and businesscenters in Lusaka and elsewhere in the country, but there were noreports of violence.   A police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said moneytraders from neighboring Zaire attempted to pass through at leastthree border posts in northwestern Zambia early Monday. He saidthey were repelled by armed frontier guards but gave no furtherdetails.   In Lusaka about 75 percent of the capital's shops and exchangecenters remained closed despite government appeals that they acceptthe old bank notes until the Aug. 3 deadline.   It is believed that Zaireans possess millions of kwacha, theZambian currency, with much of the money gained from illicittrading along the border.   In the northwestern town of Solwezi, provincial officialAlexander Kamalondo urged Zambians not to help Zaireans cross theborder to change currency.   Zambia, in the announcement Saturday on the currency change,also ordered the closing of all land-border crossings until Aug. 3.   The Finance Ministry announcement said the government wasreplacing the 1.6 billion Kwacha ($100 million) in circulation.   The currency change is one of the economic reforms ordered byPresident Kenneth Kaunda.   Under the measure Zambians will be able to exchange up to 2,000Kwacha ($125) without providing proof of the source of the money.Amounts over 10,000 Kwacha ($625) will be subject to a 50 percenttax.   The government has said it believes millions of the old currencybills have been accumulated by individuals through tax evasion,illegal money deals and smuggling, especially between Zambia andZaire.</TEXT></DOC>
