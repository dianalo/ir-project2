But whether their bite will turn out to be worse than their barkremains to be seen.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's3,200 federally insured Sandamp;Ls, has failed to prevent the problemsthat have sent the industry into the financial dog house.   Right now, about a quarter of all Sandamp;Ls are considered at or nearinsolvency, and analysts estimate it could cost as much as $100billion to liquidate them.   Still, it hasn't been all the bank board's fault. Budgetaryrestraints forced the government to cut back on the number of thriftexaminers needed to comb through financial books and detectpotential problems. The remaining examiners _ there were only 700 asrecently as two years ago _ found themselves underpaid, overworkedand with little guidance.   The bank board hopes to start changing things around byoverhauling the examination process through a new guidebook _ a sortof bible for evaluating savings and loans _ now being issued to its1,500 examiners in 12 districts nationwide.   The handbook represents the first major revision of evaluationmethods in seven years and draws upon examination procedures alreadybeing used by the Federal Reserve Board, comptroller of the currencyand Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Its goal is to detect problems earlier than in the past, thusreducing the number of future thrift failures and the drain on thealready burdened Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   Bank board spokesman Paul Lockwood explained some of therevisions:   _Changing Priorities. The new book takes a ``top-down'' approachto examinations, focusing on overall policies and procedures of aninstitution, rather than its individual loans. The old book used a``bottom-up'' approach, beginning with individual loans.   _Safety First. Examiners are encouraged to begin enforcementactions against institutions acting imprudently even if its actionsare permissible. The old book focuses on whether an institutioncomplied with specific regulations.   ``The whole idea is to make management more accountable for whatgoes on,'' Lockwood said.   _Speaking English. While the old book permitted examiners towrite their reports in technical language, the new one urges theybecome more understandable to their audience: a company's board ofdirectors.   ``The regulators have been so darn busy over the last three orfour years that they really didn't have the resources to keep the(old) book up to date,'' said Lockwood. ``As a result ... each ofthe 12 regions of the country headed by a home loan bank was left todevise their own procedures and standards.   ``Obviously some did a better job than others.''   In addition to the new handbook, the bank board has beefed up itsexaminers' staff, raised salaries and provided retraining courses.   A few critics will argue that an overhaul of the examinationprocess now is a bit like locking the barn door after the horseshave fled.   ``There's a real fundamental problem with the whole evaluationprocess,'' said Bert Ely, a Alexandria, Va., consultant. ``I'm notsure it needs more manpower. The trick is to use the numbers to letyou know when to go in and take a closer look.   ``They need to be relying on their computers to monitor andevaluate frequently reported data, like a financial EKG monitoringups and downs.''   Still, others praise the bank board's effort as a step in theright direction.   ``I think the critics are missing the point,'' said R. DanBrumbaugh Jr., a San Francisco consultant and former deputy chiefeconomist for the bank board. ``It's clear that no examiner handbookor any changing strategy will resurrect the insolvent institutions,but we still have approximately 2,100 that are solvent.   ``We've got to learn from the problems of the past and I'mcertain the bank board has ample examples from which to draw upon.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday Nov. 14</NOTE></DOC>
