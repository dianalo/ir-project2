 In fact, computer networkingis becoming common in business, academia and even households.andP;  Amongacademics, the popularity of BITNET, ARPANET, and NSFnet is well known.andP;  [1] The corporate use of electronic mail systems such as MCI Mail[TM] andCompuServe[TM] is also increasing.andP;  The rapidly decreasing cost ofcommunications technology, along with the increasing accessibility ofcomputer hardware and software, has been an important factor in thepopularity of this medium.andP;  As the cost of computing has declined, the stockof computing capital has increased correspondingly [3].andP;  This growth in thenumber of computers increases the population of potential users of computercommunication networks.andM;In this article the growth in computer network use over time is analyzed.andP;  Inparticular, we focus on the pattern and rate of adoption of a communicationsnetwork by the members of a given population.andP;  Historically, saturationmodels have been used to depict the growth of such systems.andP;  Two behavioraltheories have been used as the basis for the use of saturation models.andP;  Thefirst is the diffusion of innovation theory which provides an explanation ofhow innovations diffuse through a social system [12].andP;  The second is based onthe economic concept of network consumption externalities, wherein the valueof the network to a subscriber increases with the number of adopters of thecommunications system [14].andP;  Thus, as the network grows in size, it becomesmore attractive to nonsubscribers, inducing some of them to join the system.andO;Both thories suggest that the rate at which nonusers subscribe to the serviceis positively influenced by both the number of existing subscribers and thenumber of potential future subscribers.andP;  When the population of potentialsubscribers is finite, the resulting pattern of growth is S-shaped.andP;  Thisarticle examines this issue by analyzing the growth of BITNET,[2] a popularand successful network of university computers.andM;An understanding of the factors that underly the diffusion process isnecessary for its effective management.andP;  While this article focuses on theadoption of one computer network by organization, the results also haveimplications for the management of other related innovations such as localarea networking and facsimile machines.andP;  Moreover, the nature of diffusion incomputing networks has important implications for capacity planning, pricingand implementation strategies for network operators, as well as for theproduction strategies of the suppliers of networking hardware and software.andO;As the communications infrastructure is increasingly utilized by computercommunications systems, these issues become even more important.andM;In this article, the theory is first developed, a description of BITNET andthe data are then presented.andP;  This is followed by a statistical analysis ofthe data and a discussion of the results.andM;TheoryandM;In this section, we rpesent a brief review of the relevant innovationdiffusion and economic literatures.andM;Diffusion of Innovation TheoryandM;The nature of diffusion and adoption of a new communication technology can beviewed from the perspective of innovation diffusion theory.andP;  The theoryfocuses on the &quot;process by which an innovation is communicated throughcertain channels over time among the members of a social system.&quot; [12].andP;  Thissuggests that the four main elements in the diffusion process are theinnovation, communication channels, time, and the social system.andP;  Research inthis area has typically examined issues such as the time pattern of adoption,the categorization of adopters, and the individual adoption process [2].andM;This literature usually characterizes the diffusion process by using abell-shaped curve to describe the distribution of the time it takes to adopta system among the members of a population.andP;  Rogers has classified theadopters of innovations into five categories based on the time relative toadoption: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority andlaggard (as shown in Figure 1) [12].andP;  Factors such as risk aversion, wealth,learning, imitation, and social pressure are often cited as thecharacteristics of adopters that influence the time of their adoption of aninnovation.andP;  The growth pattern of the number of adopters corresponding tothe bell-shaped distribution is an S-curve.andP;  Such curves have been usedsuccessfully to describe the diffusion of many innovations.andP;  The Gompertz andlogistic curves are the two most widely used specifications of S-curves.andM;Rogers has applied the theory of diffusion to the study of electronicmessaging systems [13].andP;  He maintains that each individual (or organization)has a threshold of the number of other subscribers to the communicationsservice (or perhaps, in his or her personal communication network) beyondwhich he or she adopts the use of the system.andP;  Stated mathematically, theprobability that an individual will adopt an innovation is a nondecreasingfunction of the number of existing subscribers.andP;  The pattern of diffusion ofthe communications system will then naturally depend on the distribution ofthe individual threshold values over the population of the potential users ofthe system.andP;  When the individual threshold values are normally distributed,the pattern of diffusion that will be obserbed is an S-curve.andM;Rogers emphasizes the notion of the &quot;critical mass&quot; in interactive systems.andO;This is the point at which the number of adopters is large enough for thegrowth process to become self-sustaining.andP;  An interactive innovation such asa communications network is of little value unless other individuals alsoadopt the system.andP;  Markus points out that an important question that followsis why some individuals adopt such an innovation in its early stages [9].andP;  Infact it is quite conceivable that the cost of subscribing to a communicationsnetwork may outweigh the benefits for a large enough number of potentialsubscribers, in such a manner that the process does not becomeself-sustaining, rendering the innovation unsuccessful.andP;  Some recent examplesof innovations that have not achieved a critical mass and subsequently failedinclude smart cards, home banking and home shopping.andP;  (3)andM;Interestingly, Olson has pointed out that even if all the individuals in apopulation gained by acting to achieve their common interest, they stillmight not act voluntarily to achieve that common interest [11].andP;  This impliesthat even when a mature system is of value to many subscribers, individualsacting out of pure self-interest might not join in large enough numbers for acritical mass to be achieved.andP;  Thus, it may be necessary for the provider ofa communications service to offer a subsidy or discount to early adopters ofsuch a system to ensure its long term viability.andM;The Economics ApproachandM;The economics literature dealing with communication networks has beenmotivated primarily by the telephone system.andP;  Of the various issues studied,the research focusing on the estimation of the demand for communicationservices (see for example, [4, 14]) is of interest here.andP;  There are twoaspects related to the growth of such networks: adoption and use.andP;  Theadoption of a communications network refers to the number of subscribers tosuch a service.andP;  The use of computing networks refers to the quantity of suchservices consumed by its subscribers.andP;  Here, we focus primarily on the issuesdealing with the access to computing networks, though the two are clearlyrelated.andM;The economics approach is based on the observation that the value of acommunications network depends on the size and content of the set of existingsubscribers.andP;  From the perspective of any single subscriber, the utilityderived from the system increases correspondingly with an increase in the setof users with whom he or she wishes to communicate.andP;  This phenomenon has beentermed a network consumption externality.andP;  Artle and Averous havedemonstrated that this phenomenon can induce a growth process under certainconditions [1].andM;In their model, every individual possesses the same utility function, whichis a function of two variables--the consumption of private goods and thenumber of telephones to which a subscriber has access.andP;  (4)  The utilityfunction is increasing in both variables.andP;  It is further assumed that thetotal population, the distribution of income, and the relative prices stayconstant.andP;  Individuals maximize their utility subject to their budgetconstraint, which results in their joining the system in order of theirincomes.andP;  It is then shown that these assumptions result in a growth processof the demand for telephones.andM;The process is as follows: Assume an initial set of subscribers.andP;  At thispoint, only some nonusers can derive a positive net utility by subscribing tothe system.andP;  These new users join the system.andP;  This increases the utility ofthe system, which in turn results in a marginal number of nonuserssubscribing to the system.andP;  This induces further growth and so on.andP;  It isalso shown that for particular choices of the assumed utility function andthe income distribution, the resulting growth process is a logistic curve.andM;Chaddha and Chitgopekar have used a logistic formulation in estimating thedemand for Bell System residence main telephones over the period 1966-1991[4].andP;  They also extend their model to cases where the saturation orequilibrium levels are not constant and change over time.andP;  For example, thesaturation of the demand for telephones may be a function of the incomedistribution, the price of telephone service, the price of alternativecommunications medium, or other factors.andP;  A change in the value of thesefactors is likely to change the saturation level.andP;  They demonstrate that fortheir problem, this model provides a more satisfactory basis for forecastingthan the case where the equilibrium level was assumed to be constant overtime.andM;While the classic case of network consumption externalities is the ability ofa user to communicate with additional users as the system grows, othersources of consumption externalities exist as well.andP;  A service such as aneighborhood telephone book, viable only when there are a large enough numberof telephones in the neighborhood, is one example.andP;  In the case of a computernetwork, software utilities such as file transfer systems or remote loginprotocols, are often developed only when the user base has expanded to alarge enough size.andM;While the economics approach and diffusion theory have several similarities,they are somewhat different in their emphases and complement one another indeveloping an understanding of the innovation process.andP;  Indeed, Rogers notesthe equivalence of the notion of critical mass in the diffusion literaturewith the economics concept of externalities in consumption [13].andP;  Moreover,their implications for the pattern of adoption and diffusion of a computercommunications system are identical.andP;  In general, however, the economicsapproach has focused on applying utility theory to provide a formal basis forunderstanding and predicting the demand for network services.andP;  Innovationdiffusion theory has complemented this approach by focusing on the behavioralcharacteristics of adopters, the role of the communications channel, and thesocial system.andP;  Consistent with these theories, we hypothesize that thecumulative number of adopters grows over time according to an S-curve.andM;Mathematics of S-curvesandM;A test of the S-curve hypothesis requires a specification of the functionalform.andP;  The typical approach to modeling the growth of such processes isthrough the use of saturation models.andP;  This approach assumes that the demandfor communications access is limited by a saturation level.andP;  It is furtherassumed that the rate of growth in the number of subscribers is positivelyinfluenced by:andM;1) the number of existing subscribers andandM;2) by the difference between the saturation level and the number of existingsubscribers.andM;The positive impact of the number of existing subscribers on the decision toadopt has been discussed earlier.andP;  The second factor that influences the rateof network growth is the difference between the saturation level and thenumber of existing subscribers, or the potential subscribers.andP;  Naturally, asthe set of remaining potential subscribers decreases in size, one can expectthis to have a declining effect on the growth rate.andM;One formulation of the growth process that incorporates these two factors isandM;dy/dt=py (log [y.sup.*] - log y) (1)andM;where y is the number of existing subscribers and [y.sup.*] is the saturationlevel.andP;  This formulation leads to a Gompertz curve, which can also beexpressed asandM;yt=_KA.sup.b.sup.T] (2)andM;For this curve, the growth increments of the logarithms of [y.sub.T] declineby a constant percentage b.andP;  When both A and b are between 0 and 1, [y.sub.T]is an increasing S-curve which tends to the upper bound K as T [right arrow][infinity].andP;  The Gompertz curve reaches its maximum growth rate when[y.sub.T] = K/e, that is, when [y.sub.T] reaches about 37 percent of itsupper bound.andM;A second formulation isandM;dy/dt=qy ([y.sup.*] - y) (3)andM;leading to the logistic curve, which can also be written asandM;yT=1/K + [Ab.sup.T] (4)andM;Here, the first differences between the reciprocals of [y.sub.T] declines bya constant percentage.andP;  For A [is greater than] 0 and 0 [is less than] b [isless than] 1, the logistic is an increasing S-curve which tends to be thelimit 1/K as T [right arrow] [infinity].andP;  The maximum growth rate is achievedwhen [Phi](T = 1/2 K, that i, at half the equilibriumlevel of [y.sub.T], andthe growth rate function is symmetric around this maximum value.andM;We hypothesize that the growth in the use of computer communication networkswill also follow an S-curve.andP;  We test our hypothesis on data collected on thegrowth in the use of BITNET.andP;  We test the two major functional forms ofS-curves--the logistic and the Gompertz curves.andP;  An S-curve specification canbe approximated by an exponential curve, characterized by a constant ratio ofchange, when an innovation is in its early stages.andP;  Thus, we also test anexponential growth pattern.andP;  In the next section, we briefly discuss thecharacteristics of BITNET.andM;The DATAandM;BITNET is a nine-year-old telecommunications network that links users inacademic institutions in the United States and in foreign countries.andP;  Thepurpose of BITNET is to facilitate communication among universities.andP;  Anyuniversity may use the network for either academic or administrativecommunications.andP;  Universities with any one of a large set of minicomputersand mainframes can easily become part of the network, since thecommunications software supports a wide variety of different hardware.andP;  Thecomputers in BITNET are connected via leased telephone lines, and users canshare information through electronic mail in the form of interactivemessages, text files, and computer programs.andM;The network was founded in the spring of 1981 by establishing a link betweenthe City University of New York [CUNY] and Yale University.andP;  At first, therewas considerable doubt ober whether the &quot;network would ever reach a usefulcritical mass&quot; [10].andP;  Indeed, even though several dozen institutions hadexpressed an interest in joining such a service, in a survey conducted priorto implementing the network, only six universities were actually linked toBITNET by the end of 1981.andP;  Two years later, the network had grown to 19sites with a total of 65 nodes.andP;  (5)  In the summer of 1988, there were over1,500 nodes connected to the network.andM;BITNET's philosophy was that each subscribing academic instituion would leasea line to the nearest existing network node and provide at least oneconnection point for future members.andP;  New members would thus increase thegeographic distribution of the network.andP;  BITNET was a cooperative network inthat each node contributed communications lines, storage and processingwithout charge to the other nodes.andP;  Moreover, the network relied heavily onvolunteer efforts and informal agreements between universities to maintainand operate the network.andM;For example, in 1982, the University of California at Berkeley was the firstWest Coast university to join.andP;  They had to lease a long, expensive line, andsince they provided a significant service to later West Coast adopters, theyasked them to share the cost of the transcontinental line.andP;  As a result, WestCoast users paid a voluntary subsidy to Berkeley as weall as for their leasedline to the nearest node.andP;  Network members also contributed by developingadditional utilities and tools such as end-user access programs, databases,and emulation programs for other operating systems.andM;As the network expanded, it became clear that the size and complexity ofBITNET and the ongoing maintenance requirements could better be served byestablishing a full-time network support center.andP;  In 1984 IBM funded EDUCOM,with CUNY providing centralized network services.andP;  Between 1984 and 1986,BITNET doubled in size almost every six months.andP;  During this period oftremendous growth, links to NETNORTH in Canada and a transatlantic line tothe European scientific community were established.andP;  A connection to Japanwas also initiated in 1985.andP;  When IBM fudning for centralized network supportexpired in 1986, the newly founded BITNET Executive Committee decided toimplement a membership fee to defray the cost of maintaining a viablenetwork.andP;  The membership fee depends on the annual budget of the subscribinginstitution.andP;  Figure 2 summarizes BITNET's early growth and the major eventsduring the first five years of the network's existence.andM;The BITNET Network Information Center (BITNIC) was organized in 1984 toprovide BITNET users with technical and policy guidelines, management andadministrative procedures, information compilation and disseminationservices, and technical development and support services.andP;  The data used inthis analysis was obtained from BITNIC.andP;  It consists of quarterly data on thetotal number of nodes connected to the system, including nodes in the UnitedStates, Canada (NORTHNET), Europe (EARN), and Japan, for the period 1981 tothe second quarter of 1988.andP;  Quarterly data on the number of nodes only inthe United States during that period was also obtained.andP;  Finally, quarterlydata on the number of sites for the period 1981-1986 was also obtained.andP;  Asummary of the data is presented in Table I.andP;  The central source of theinformation and the incentives that exist for users to ensure that theirparticipation is known, would support the reliability of the data.andM;Analysis of the DataandM;In this section, we test the hypothesis that the pattern of adoption ofcomputing networks can be modeled as an S-curve versus the alternativehypothesis that the rate of growth follows an exponential pattern.andP;  Inparticular, we use the Gompertz and logistic functional forms of S-curves.andO;The determination of the appropriate functional form has important behavioralimplications.andP;  The Gompertz curve exhibits a more nearly constant rate ofgrowth in later stages than the logistic.andP;  Further, the Gompertz curveattains its maximum rate of growth at an earlier stage than the logistic,which is symmetrical.andP;  These distinctions have important implications forcapacity planners.andP;  The analysis also allows us to make specific observationsabout BITNET.andP;  For example, it allows us to estimate the expected saturationlevel in the case of BITNET and to determine the current stage of the networkwith respect to this saturation level.andP;  The analysis consists of examiningthe pattern of growth of BITNET at three levels: United States sites, UnitedStates nodes, and worldwide nodes.andP;  (6)  While the analysis is presented forall three cases, the focus is on the growth of BITNET nodes in the UnitedStates for several reasons.andM;The volume of communications between universities in a single regiondominates over that between regions.andP;  The expansion of BITNET overseas gaverise to growth processes in each of the new regions.andP;  Thus, the data on totalnodes reflects the superimposition of several growth processes, each of whichwere initiated in different periods.andP;  This phenomenon may mask the underlyingpattern of growth.andP;  On the other hand, considering only the United Statesdataset effectively ignores the value of communications with users outsidethe United States.andP;  We maintain that since most communications are domestic,the impact of overseas users on the adoption decision of United States usersis slight.andP;  (7)andM;The choice between sites and nodes is less clear.andP;  The first node at any siteto adopt BITNET is usually the centralized computing facility on a universitycampus.andP;  The existence of a BITNET node at any site dramatically reduces theaccess costs of other potential nodes since these nodes now only need aninternal link to the central site.andP;  Very often, these links already existedon campuses for local networking purposes.andP;  Thus, the decision of acentralized site to adopt is likely to spawn a set of additional nodes atthat site.andP;  On the other hand, the decision of a centralized site to adoptBITNET may already recognize the demand of these nodes for externalcommunications services, since providing such services is often a part of thecharter of centralized computing facilities.andP;  It is therefore not clear whichof the two measures better captures the essence of the diffusion process [2].andM;In any event, the number of sites is highly correlated linearly with thenumber of nodes.andP;  In the overlapping period, the number of nodes is 3.97times the number of sites, suggesting that the analysis is unlikely to bematerially affected by the choice.andP;  We elected to focus on the growth patternof nodes since the site data is available only until 1986, which wouldobviously force us to ignore the more recent growth.andP;  Since estimating thesaturation level of BITNET is of interest in our analysis, the more recentobservations are of considerable importance.andM;Another point determined prior to the analysis was whether the saturationlevel could be assumed to be constant.andP;  While in general the saturation levelof a network may change over time, the case of BITNET is quite different.andP;  Itshould be noted that BITNET's potential subscriber base is the set ofresearch universities, most of which already possessed significant mainframecomputing power in 1981 when the network was initiated.andP;  It is thereforereasonable to assume that the saturation level has remained roughly constant.andM;We begin with a graphical analysis of the growth of BITNET nodes in theUnited States.andP;  The cumulative number of these nodes is plotted against timein Figure 3.andP;  It is apparent from the figure that the number of nodesincreased very slowly at first.andP;  The growth rate then appeared to accelerate.andO;The pattern of growth in recent years, however, is not apparent from a visualinspection.andP;  Formal statistical analysis is called for to determine theunderlying pattern of growth.andM;Our analysis begins with a test of the exponential growth model.andP;  Thisimplies that the appropriate regression equation is given byandM;log([y.sub.T]) = C + D.T.andM;The parameters of this equation were estimated by using ordinary leastsquares.andP;  The results are presented in Table 2, and a graphical depiction ofthe fit is in Figure 4.andP;  The model predicts that the number of nodes isgrowing at the rate of 18 percent annually.andP;  While the value of the [R.sup.2]term is high ([R.sup.2] = 0.976), it is clear from the figure that theexponential model overestimates the more recent growth of the number ofUnited States nodes with increasing positive residuals, suggesting that thismodel does not provide an adequate behavioral description of the growthphenomenon.andM;The exponential model applied to United States sites and worldwide nodesreveals the same behavioral pattern.andP;  The results of these regressions arepresented in Table 2.andP;  Once again, while the value of the [R.sup.2h term ishigh, this growth model overestimates the recent growth as in the case ofUnited States nodes.andP;  These regressions suggest taht models are called forwhich incorporate a decreasing rate of growth, such as the S-curve models, incontrast to the constant proportional rate of growth of exponential models.andM;Next, consider the Gompertz curve.andP;  The form of the Gompertz curve wasspecified in equation (2) and is reproduced here for convenience.andM;[y.sub.T] = [KA.sup.bT]andM;We estimated the parameters of equation (2) using non-linear least squares.andO;The results are presented in Table 3, and Figure 5 includes a graphicaldepiction of the fit.andP;  While the [R.sub.2] of the regression is high (0.979),two of the three estimated coefficients have insignificant t-statistics andare therefore not statistically different from zero.andP;  An examination ofFigure 5 also reveals that in later years, the predicted values are growingfar more rapidly than the observed values, leading to increasing positiveresiduals.andP;  In fact, the Gompertz curve results in a predicted value of thesaturation level of 40,000 nodes, a figure that is obviously unreasonable.andO;We therefore reject the Gompertz curve hypothesis.andP;  Given the failure of theCompertz model, we did not apply this model to the other two cases.andM;Next we considered the logistic curve.andP;  The form of the logistic curve wasspecified in (4) and is reproduced here for convenience.andM;[y.sub.T] = 1/K + [Ab.sup.T]andM;Once again we estimated the parameters using non-linear least squares.andP;  Theresults are presented in Table 4, and a graphical depiction of the fit is inFigure 6.andP;  The logistic curve results in an excellent fit with the data, asis evidenced by the high value of the [R.sup.2] term ([R.sup.2] = 0.976).andO;The t-statistics for all three estimated parameters are highly significant.andO;A visual examination of the graphical fit also supports his conclusion.andM;While the graph shows that the predicted values accurately estimate thegrowth in the earlier periods as well as the most recent behavior, itunderestimates the growth rate in 1985.andP;  These higher growth rates coincidewith the operationalization of the BITNIC node which contributed to anincrease in the level of awareness and, perhaps more importantly, alsoincreased the support services to new subscribers.andP;  A second phenomenon thatshould also be noted is the implementation of the gateway to ARPANET andCSNET.andP;  Since adopters of BITNET suddenly have access to a considerablylarger set of individuals or organizations than in the prior period, thenumber of nonsubscribers who now find it beneficial to subscribe risessharply.andP;  Thus, the rate of addition of nodes is likely to increase rapidlyfor a while before returning to its equilibrium growth path.andM;This model estimates the saturation level of the networks as 1,689 nodes.andO;This estimate appears to be a reasonable upper bound for the size of thenetwork, given the network's current focus on research universities.andP;  Theresults show that in the summer of 1988, the size of the network was 89percent of its predicted maximum.andM;We developed a forecast of the growth of BITNET through the year 1990.andP;  Thisis depicted in Figure 7.andP;  This figure shows that the United States portion ofBITNET achieved saturation, defined as 95 percent of the maximum, in 1989,only eight years after the network was founded.andP;  It is illustrative tocompare this with the penetration of household telephones in the UnitedStates.andP;  Chaddha and Chitgopekar determined that the penetration of householdtelephones doubled from 35 percent to 70 percent in the 33 year period 1946to 1969 [4].andP;  The corresponding figure for BITNET is two and one-half years.andM;The analysis of the estimated growth curve also demonstrated that theinflection point of the curve occurred in the third quarter of 1987.andP;  Thismeans the rate of growth of the network was increasing until this time, whenit began to decrease.andP;  This is contrary to earlier claims [8] that theleveling-off process in the diffusion of BITNET began in 1985, the periodthat we found accounted for some of the most significant increases.andM;The logistic curve also provides an excellent fit with the data on UnitedStates sites and worldwide nodes (see Table 4).andP;  All independent variablesare strongly significant.andP;  The estimated saturation level of the member ofsites in the United States is 477.andP;  Correspondingly, in the case of worldwidenodes, it is estimated that there are 2,420 nodes at saturation.andM;We also find it extremely interesting that, although both the Gompertz andlogistic models describe S-curve growth, only the logistic model provides anadequate description of the behavioral characteristics of the growth.andP;  Recallthat these two curves assume different frequently distributions of thethreshold values of the population.andP;  The logistic curve is derived from asymmetric frequency distribution while the Gompertz curve is based upon askewed frequency distribution.andP;  The results show that the rate of diffusionin the case of BITNET has been nearer to symmetric, as the logistichypothesis would suggest, rather than attaining is maximum growth rate at anearlier stage as the Gompertz curve would imply.andM;DiscussionandM;The research has provided strong support for the hypothesis that the adoptionof BITNET follows an S-curve pattern over time.andP;  As discussed earlier, thishypothesis can be predicted using related concepts from innovation diffusiontheory and economics.andP;  This pattern is consistent with the adoption of otherinformation technology products and services [2].andM;The initiation of BITNET provides interesting insights into the nature andcharacteristics of the pioneers and early adopters.andP;  BITNET was the vision ofIra Fuchs, then vice chancellor for University Systems as CUNY, and GreydonFreeman, director of the Yale Computing Center.andP;  Both campuses had madeconsiderable use of local networking.andP;  Having recognized the collaborativenature of academic work and the resulting value of such a network to theacademic community, they had already planned to link the two campuses.andP;  CUNYconducted a survey to determine the level of interest among otheruniversities on the eastern seaboard.andP;  Having determined that there wasconsiderable interest, the network was initiated.andP;  At this stage, there asstill considerable doubt about the viability of such a network [10].andP;  Theseobservations are consistent with the typical characteristics of pioneers whoare venturesome, have a high tolerance for uncertainty, and are usuallyresponsible for launching new ideas into a social system [12].andM;The primary sources of information dissemination about the network wereletters and phone calls to universities inviting them to participate.andO;Initial response was slow, consistent with the notion that a critical mass isessential before a self-sustaining growth rate is achieved.andP;  From aneconomics viewpoint, the consumption externalities were slight with a smalluser base, so few universities found it beneficial to join.andP;  Two years later,only 19 universities had adopted BITNET.andP;  Once the critical mass was reached,however, the growth rate increased dramatically to where the number of nodesdoubled every six months.andM;There are several interesting features to be noted about the early adopters.andO;The network was initially targeted to eastern users.andP;  Since benefits to earlyadopters are usually small, keeping communication costs low is important ifadoption of the network is to be cost effective.andP;  Correspondingly, most ofthe early adopters were eastern institutions.andP;  Most of these universitieswere also premier academic institutions, which is consistent with Rogers'categorization of early adopters having &quot;higher social status&quot; andaggressively seeking still higher levels [12].andP;  It is well-known that theleading universities are extremely competitive and actively search for waysto support their research endeavors.andP;  A significant event in the evolution ofBITNET was the adoption by the University of California, Berkeley.andP;  Thisgreatly lowered the access costs to other western universities whosubsequently joined the network.andM;As the size of the network grew and achieved a critical mass, consumptionexternalities beyond the ability to communicate with a larger set of userswere generated, as might have been predicted.andP;  Users voluntarily developedshared utilities that increased the value of the network.andP;  For example, YaleUniversity developed a set of end-user utilities to replace theprogrammer-oriented commands that were required previously.andP;  CuNY developedBITSERVE, a file repository and directory.andP;  Emulation programs of the networksoftware for Unix[TM] and DEC[TM] VMS[TM] operating systems were developed.andO;Databases for updating site information, maps of the network topology andmail transport utilities are other examples of utilities that were developed.andM;It was also seen that the overall rate of diffusion was extremely rapid andthe level of saturation was achieved in approximtely eight years.andP;  It shouldbe noted that a key factor in this fast diffusion process was the priorexistence of a well-defined community with shared interests.andP;  A second reasonis that this community of research institutions also possesses thecharascteristic of being leading-edge users of technology.andP;  Thus, it may bereasonable to conclude that the rapid growth of BITNET may not readily beduplicated by other innovations.andP;  (8)andM;The result of this research have implications for other communicationnetworks.andP;  While the results were derived by using the case of an academiccomputing network with special characteristics, such as a group of users withcommon interests and not chargeback to individual users, similarcharacteristics exist in many other organizational settings.andP;  Many largecorporations have built national and international networks that link theirgeographically distributed divisions.andP;  Clearly, employees of a singlecorporation have a shared interest and in many cases, individual users arenot charged for their use of these networks.andM;Similarly, a local area network of personal computers in an organization isalso usually characterized by a workgroup, or some set of users with relatedinterests, and the absence of any formal chargeback policies.andP;  In fact,similar results have been obtained even in the case of communications systemswith considerably different characteristics such as the telephone system [4].andM;These results may als obe generalized to other information technology-relatedinnovatoins such as the introduction of large application systems and evennew managerial or technical practices [15].andP;  Electronic scanner systems andMRP systems are two examples of applications systems whose adoption, bothwithin and between organizations, is likely to be influenced by behavioralphenomena comparable to those discussed above.andP;  A similar argument alsoapplies to the adoption of new technical practices--such as the use of CASEmethodologies by software development groups--and to managerial innovations,such as information centers.andM;In all of these cases, an innovation is introduced into a social system.andP;  Ourresults, based on economic and sociological theories, show that the likelytime pattern of adoption fo such innovations will be an S-curve.andP;  As the caseof BITNET demonstrates, management can increase the probability of success byfocusing on activities such as defining the community of users who areinclined to adopt the innovation--particularly those who are likely to beearly adopters.andP;  More significantly, they should identify those whoseadoption of the innovation is likely to most rapidly influence nonusers tosubscribe.andM;A related concern is to develop a system of incentives that encourages usersto subscribe at an early stage so the adoption process can becomeself-sustaining.andP;  Management should also plan for the addition of relatedproducts and services that will increase the value of the innovation both interms of the type of products and services and the access levels at which itbecomes economically viable to offer them.andP;  Moreover, similar empiricalmodels of S-curve behavior can also be developed to forecast the demand forsuch innovations to aid in capacity planning.andM;Concluding RemarksandM;In this article, we have analyzed the growth of the computing network,BITNET.andP;  It was shown that the pattern of diffusion in the case of BITNET isS-shaped and is consistent with a logistic curve, that describes asymmetrical growth process.andP;  The success of BITNET clearly demonstrates theunderlying demand for national and international digital communications.andP;  Therapid growth in the demand for facsimile machines provides another example.andO;Speculation might be that with the growing internationalization of businessnad the advent of personal computing, similar networks may become as routineas the telephone system.andM;Some interesting questions arise regarding the future of such networks.andO;Several existing networks such as ARPANET, CSNET and NSFnet allowcommunications between academic institutions.andP;  More recently, INTERNET wasinitiated to facilitate communications between the various networks.andO;Institutions can now subscribe to any one of these networks and have theability to communicate with users on allof the networks.andP;  An implication ofthis is that adopters may choose to cancel their subscriptions to some ofthese networks.andP;  This raises stimulating research questions about theevolution of innovations over time.andP;  Even successful innovations may evolveto a point where they are replaced because of their own success.andM;(1) Witness the use of BITNET by Chinese students in transmitting informationon the political situation in China [6].andM;(2) BITNET stands for Because It's Time Network.andM;(3) Some of these innovations have been reintroduced with better success.andM;(4) Note that thsi is an approximation to the &quot;true&quot; case where the identityof subscribers is also important.andM;(5) A site refers to one institution such as a university campus whereseveral nodes could be located.andM;(6) Note that site data was not available at the aggregate (worldwide) level.andM;(7) A factor that may increase the impact of overseas users is the relativelyhigher costs of alternative communications media to overseas destinations.andM;(8) The facsimile machine is an example of an innovation that is currentlyexperiencing rapid growth, but is unlikely to achieve the penetration levelof BITNET, due to the size of the potential population.andM;ReferencesandM;[1] Artle, R. and Averous, C.andP;
