SullivanandM;The airline industry is at the threshold of adopting a more cost-effectivecrew-scheduling system with the help of a RISC platform that performsoperations formerly done on a mainframe.andM;American Airlines Inc. is porting its IBM MVS/TSO mainframe application forflight-crew scheduling to RISC-based workstations from MIPS Computer SystemsInc. that run Unix.andM;American's commercial mainframe system, the Crew Allocation System, iscurrently used by many major airlines.andP;  When American rolls out the newRISC-based Workstation Crew Allocation System this summer, it hopes toattract all segments of the airline industry.andM;&quot;We're aiming the new workstation version at the entire airline market --from commuter to large planes,&quot; said Shane Batt, a senior consultant withAmerican's Decision Technology group in Fort Worth, Texas.andP;  Because it is aUnix application, the system can easily be scaled to suit airlines with anynumber of planes, he said.andM;Although it is slated for commercial availability, the Workstation CrewAllocation System was designed with only one customer in mind: AmericanAirlines.andM;&quot;The size of our fleets is growing very rapidly, and maintaining thescheduling system on the mainframe complex has become burdensome,&quot; said Batt.andM;By midyear, the system will be used to schedule crews for American's ninefleets, each of which has a maximum of 250 aircraft.andM;Workstation PowerhousesandM;The new mission-critical scheduling application is running on RS2030workstations from MIPS, of Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  These 32-bit RISC graphicsworkstations feature processor speeds of 12 million instructions per second(mips) and 1.8 million floating-point operations per second.andP;  Powered by theMIPS 16.67MHz R2000 chip set, the workstations run the RISC/os Unix operatingsystem and support the OSF/Motif graphical user interface.andM;&quot;RISC computers require fewer machine cycles to perform numeric operations,so it's an ideal environment,&quot; he said.andM;At the Fort Worth offices, 21 of the RS2030 workstations -- each with a16-inch color monitor, 12M bytes of memory and 172M bytes of hard-diskstorage -- are linked via an Ethernet TCP/IP network to two MIPS RC3240tower-style servers.andM;One of the RC3240 servers functions as a communications gateway to American'scommercial IBM mainframe complex in Tulsa, Okla., where flight-scheduling,financial and other business-related applications are running.andP;  Informationneeded for crew scheduling, such as flight schedules, is downloaded to theMIPS server.andP;  Once completed, crew schedules are uploaded to the mainframe.andM;This process of off-loading an application from the mainframe will save theairline money as well as allow scheduling analysts to improve their scheduledesign, said Batt.andP;  Since the Workstation Crew Allocation System performsmathematical optimization, the longer the application is run, the better theresults, he said.andM;One key benefit of bringing crew scheduling to the workstation is responsetime.andP;  While a typical mainframe job requires nine hours, a workstationhandles this task in three hours, said Batt.andM;In addition to lower computing costs, another expected benefit is increasedproductivity of flight crews.andP;  The airline industry is plagued with payingcrew members for layovers.andP;  With the Workstation Crew Allocation System,American hopes to reduce its &quot;pay and credit&quot; costs by scheduling crews ontoother flights more quickly.andM;American estimated the return on investment for the RISC workstations andscheduling application to be 70 percent per year over a five-year period.andM;&quot;We are saving money in two ways,&quot; said Batt.andP;  &quot;One, the crew schedulers gettheir results faster and get better solutions.andP;  The other is that Americangets faster response time on the mainframe, because a resource-intensiveapplication is no longer using mainframe resources.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
