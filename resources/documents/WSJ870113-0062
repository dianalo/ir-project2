While the sweetened offer still is contingent on Owens-Illinois agreeing to a friendly leveraged buyout, Kohlberg Kravis's latest move has taken a distinctly aggressive tone. &quot;It's a bear hug, more or less,&quot; said one Wall Street arbitrager, referring to an ostensibly friendly offer that is meant to pressure a reluctant target's board into a merger.    The cash component of New York-based Kohlberg Kravis's new bid, $48.50, is the same as the firm's previous bid. But the company also offered what it described as &quot;junior securities&quot; that it said would be worth $11.50 a share, compared with $6.50 in the previous offer.    In Toledo, Ohio, officials of Owens-Illinois, a containers and forest products concern, declined to comment on the sweetened bid. Earlier yesterday, the company said its directors had rejected the initial $3.32 billion bid by Kohlberg Kravis and instead had authorized a 20 million-share buyback and the sale of $1 billion of assets.    Owens-Illinois said its share purchases would be financed by existing credit lines and new ones &quot;to be arranged.&quot; If all 20 million shares were purchased, the company's equity would be reduced by about one-third. A spokesman said the company has about 60 million shares outstanding.    The buyback has an indicated value of $102.3 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Owens-Illinois shares closed at $51.125, down $4.125, on volume of 2.7 million shares.    Kohlberg Kravis announced its sweetened bid after the market closed.    Owens-Illinois directors approved the divestiture of $1 billion worth of &quot;assets not fitting the company's long-term strategy,&quot; including the company's forest products division, the company said. That division consists of paper mills, linerboard plants and timberland; Owens-Illinois in the past year already has sold some of the division's assets.    Owens-Illinois said the rejection of the earlier offer &quot;was based on its belief that greater long-term values can be achieved for stockholders&quot; by following the company's &quot;strategic plan,&quot; and pursuing the stock buyback and asset sale.    A spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis said its new bid is meant to derail the defensive measures Owens-Illinois announced yesterday. Wall Street traders said Owens-Illinois moved aggressively yesterday to begin its share repurchases, placing orders only hours after the announcement.    While analysts cautioned that they hadn't had time to analyze Kohlberg Kravis's latest offer, they said that it appeared to top the value of the restructuring. &quot;I calculate the value of the restructuring at a range of from $52 to $56 share,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;I'd say $60 is a good bid, but not a great bid; $65 would be a great bid.&quot;    Some traders said the decline in Owens-Illinois's stock price yesterday reflected initial surprise and disappointment over the Ohio company's rejection of what many thought had been a friendly offer encouraged by Owens-Illinois, rather than a careful evaluation of the company's plan.    The board &quot;has sent a clear message that it (Owens-Illinois) prefers to remain an independent public company,&quot; one analyst said.    Kohlberg Kravis said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the rejection of its earlier bid, and complained that Owens-Illinois had refused to meet with Kohlberg Kravis or its investment advisers to negotiate the terms of the firm's proposal.    An adviser to Owens-Illinois's special committee of directors that recommended rejection of the earlier bid declined to comment on Kohlberg Kravis's assertions, but said the firm &quot;approached us in a friendly fashion, and in that spirit we would expect them to accept the board's decision to reject their proposal.&quot;    Kohlberg Kravis said its new bid would be financed with bank debt and wouldn't involve the issuance of high-yielding junk bonds. It said its financial advisers, First Boston Corp. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., had rendered opinions that the new offer was fair to shareholders, and said they would join with the company's investment bankers to make sure the securities offered have a market value of $11.50 a share.    Under Owens-Illinois's restructuring plan, the company would continue to expand its nursing home business to 50,000 beds nationwide from its current total of 16,000. However, the outline of the plan didn't mention the company's mortgage banking business, suggesting that it could be sold, a source close to the company said.    The company said the plan could result in 1987 profit of about $4 a share, compared with per-share profit in the range of $2.90 to $2.95 that the company said it expects to post for 1986. For the nine months, the company earned $144.1 million, or $2.37 a share, on revenue of $2.74 billion.    Owens-Illinois's plan also would include &quot;long-term incentives designed to increase significantly management equity ownership in the company,&quot; the company said. Kohlberg Kravis noted specifically that &quot;management investment in the new company is not a condition&quot; of its proposal.    While Kohlberg Kravis has consistently said it is only interested in friendly transactions, the leveraged buyout it led last year of Beatrice Cos. had unfriendly aspects, and a number of top Beatrice executives lost their jobs. Kohlberg Kravis reiterated yesterday that Owens-Illinois would remain an independent company with headquarters in Toledo.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company largely with borrowings. The debt ultimately is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
