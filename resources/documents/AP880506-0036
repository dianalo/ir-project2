Kissinger said Thursday that France's action ``raises the riskfor all other nationalities ... because now the Iranians willundoubtedly believe that they can make similar deals with othernations and it will be a gory extended effort to prove that theycan't.''   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for thehostages' release but others accused the country of dealing withterrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage. Reports saidthat in exchange for the three Frenchmen, France agreed to pay theoutstanding balance on a loan originally totaling $1 billion madeby the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.   ``I think the French action today is disgraceful,'' Kissingersaid.   He added that while it would it wouldn't feasible to engage ineconomic reprisals against France, ``I would think that it shouldeffect those relationships over which we have some discretion.   ``It certainly disappoints me severely that a French primeminister, a conservative prime minister, would engage in suchactions,'' Kissinger said, referring to Premier Jacques Chirac.   Kissinger appeared on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program along withformer National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who was involvedin the secret Iran-Contra negotiations to win the release ofAmericans held in Lebanon, and Peggy Say, sister to Americanhostage Terry Anderson. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage in Lebanon.   McFarlane said there are no moderate officials to deal with inIran and that to ``literally deal with the devil for whatevershort-term gain it might get us would only encourage ... the takingof more hostages.''   Mrs. Say said that while it is easy to discuss theories offoreign policy, ``my job has to be the voice for Terry Anderson andthe other hostages whose voices can't be heard.''   ``These are American lives and it seems to me that there has tobe a better way,'' she said. ``I think there ... are better answersthan doing nothing and just literally turning our backs on thesemen and saying, `We're sorry .. if they have to die but we have tostop terrorism.'''</TEXT></DOC>
