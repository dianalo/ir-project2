The magnetic fieldconfiguration is derived from a Solov'ev equilibrium with finite poloidalmagnetic fields. The conducting boundary may be of arbitrary shape. Themode conversion model is that of Colestock et al. in which the fourth-orderfinite-temperature wave equation is reduced to a second-order equationthat describes the effects of mode conversion on the fast wave but neglectsthe detailed structure of the ion Bernstein wave. Results show the effectof a noncircular cross section on excitation, wave propagation, and absorptionin Doublet III-D and the Joint European Torus (JET). Also, in the limitof a circular cross section, toroidal phasing of the resonant double-loopantenna design for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) is studied.</TEXT></DOC>
