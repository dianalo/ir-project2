The glass-ceramic specimenswere processed in the same manner as is presently being used in the manufacturingof glass-ceramic headers. The processing steps involve four-step solventcleaning, sealing at high temperature, and oxide removal. At each stepin the process, glass samples were studied with AES and ESCA to determinetheir resultant elemental surface composition and film thickness. Inaddition, the effect of a final plasma cleaning operation on the glasssurface was also examined. The results show that the type, concentration,and thickness of surface species are dependent on the processing technique.1 ref., 4 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
