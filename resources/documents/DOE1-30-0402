In white male smokers, the reported incidence of cancer of thelung is 15 to 30 times higher than in nonsmokers. Of all carcinomas,bronchogenic carcinoma carries the highest mortality rate, but it mayhave reached a plateau in males. The incidence and mortality rate infemales is now rising, with one study showing a drop in male:female ratiofrom 15 to 1 in the years 1955 to 1959 to 6 to 1 in the years 1968 to1971 - a trend that appears to be related to an increase in female smokers.An increase in all cell types of lung cancer occurs in cigarette smoker.There also appears to be an increase in lung cancer in workers exposedto asbestos, arsenic, beryllium, chromate, nickel, vinyl chloride, radongas, atomic radiation, and bis-chloromethyl ether (BCME). The numberof workers studied does not allow a final conclusion about the cell typepredominance in these groups.</TEXT></DOC>
