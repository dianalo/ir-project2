Despite a scaling back of their compensation program, six top executives of the securities firm earned more last year than any other executive of a major publicly held Wall Street firm.    Chairman and Chief executive Alan C. Greenberg was the highest paid, earning $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, according to Bear Stearns' proxy statement.    James E. Cayne and E. John Rosenwald Jr., co-presidents, earned about $3.9 million each; Alvin H. Einbender, executive vice president and chief operating officer, $3.7 million; and Thomas R. Anderson and Denis P. Coleman Jr., executive vice presidents, $3,394,604 each.    The highest-paid executive at any other publicly held firm in 1986 was Richard J. Schmeelk, a Salomon Inc. executive vice president, who earned $3,391,915, according to that firm's proxy statement.    Compensation at Bear Stearns is based largely on a bonus program tied to profits, which have risen sharply the past two years. &quot;We keep making more money and we keep scaling back&quot; the compensation formula, Mr. Greenberg said in an interview. The firm plans to change its compensation program again this year, according to the proxy statement.    Executives at closely held firms such as Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. are said to earn considerably more than their competitors at publicly held houses. Some investment bankers and salesmen also make more than their bosses, but such salaries aren't listed in proxy statements.    Bear Stearns officials were embarrassed last year when it was revealed that Mr. Greenberg had earned more in the six months ended April 30, 1986 -- $4 million -- than any other executive at a publicly held securities firm earned in all of 1985. &quot;We're making too much money,&quot; Mr. Greenberg said at the time.    Bear Stearns only reported half-year compensation figures for fiscal 1986 because it had become a public company six months earlier and decided to end the fiscal year early to establish an April 30 year-end date.    Bear Stearns reported pro forma net income for fiscal 1986 of $132 million, up 50% from $88 million pro forma in fiscal 1985. For fiscal 1987, which ended this past April 30, net income jumped 31% to $173 million over the pro forma 1986 results.    Bear Stearns yesterday reported that net for the first fiscal quarter ended July 31 more than doubled to $47.9 million, or 53 cents a share, from $18.9 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues jumped 44% to $482.7 million from $334.1 million.    For the fiscal year ended this past April, the firm cut back the percentage of pretax profits going into the bonus program. But the bonus formula still yielded what some officials at the firm concede was an overly generous return to top executives.    Still, Mr. Greenberg yesterday defended the compensation program, noting that his guaranteed annual salary last year was $150,000, which he said was the lowest of any Wall Street chief executive. &quot;The only chance I have of making big money is if the firm&quot; performs well, he said.    For the current year, Bear Stearns is altering its payout plan again, so executives would earn proportionately less at lower levels of profitability but proportionately more at higher profits levels. For example, if pretax earnings are less than $200 million, the amount of money going into the bonus pool would generally be less than under last year's program. Pretax earnings of more than $200 million would generally net executives a greater share of those profits. Last year, the firm earned $329 million before taxes.    The firm is eliminating a $20 million supplemental salary fund for top executives, replacing it with a less costly, $50,000 raise in base salary for senior executives. &quot;We've made so many changes I can't even follow it any more,&quot; Mr. Greenberg said. </TEXT></DOC>
