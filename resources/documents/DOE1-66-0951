<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0951 </DOCNO><TEXT>The structural performance of a half-scale prototype metal-matrix containerfor the disposal of used nuclear fuel has been assessed. The assessmentwas based on a detailed comparison between the predictions of an analyticalmodel and the results of a structural performance test conducted on theprototype in the Hydrostatic Test Facility at WNRE. The results of theanalysis show that the onset of plastic deformation occurs at 0.33 MPa.The maximum effective stress and strain at the vault design hydrostaticload of 10 MPa were 340 MPa and 12%, respectively. No buckling instabilityoccurred. The qualitative agreement of the analysis with the test resultsis encouraging; however, a number of discrepancies exist. The probablecauses of these discrepancies are discussed. 19 refs., 50 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
