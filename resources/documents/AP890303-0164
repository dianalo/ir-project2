LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mexico announced Friday it is reducing crudeoil exports by 5 percent beginning April 1 in a coordinated movewith other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the worldmarket.   Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a dayfrom the current average of 1.37 million, the Department of Energyand Mines said in a statement.   ``With this, Mexico fully acknowledges that strengthening the oilmarket is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, sinceeveryone benefits from a stable market and (fair) prices,'' it said.   The statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but asource at Pemex, the state petroleum monopoly, said the cut willprobably be maintained at least until the end of the year, dependingon world market conditions.   The cut was tentatively agreed upon Feb. 21 at a conference byMexico _ the world's fourth biggest producer and sixth largestexporter _ and the five other non-OPEC producers in London. Twoweeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details.   At the London conference, Mexico proposed to cut exports by 5percent provided the other non-OPEC nations did the same. Theagreement came after the 13 members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries agreed to cut exports during a meeting inVienna, Austria.   Participating in the talks at the Mexican Embassy in London wereMexico, Oman, Malaysia, Egypt, China and Angola. The Soviet Union,Colombia, North Yemen, Norway and the state of Alaska and theCanadian province of Alberta sent observers.   Although Mexico refuses to join OPEC, it has often used theinternational cartel's guidelines to set prices and export limits.   OPEC members Alberia, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela together were estimated to be producing inFebruary about 19.5 million barrels a day.   This was 1 million above their agreed production limit but wellbelow their fourth-quarter production last year. OPEC has set atarget price of $18 a barrel for the second quarter of this year.   Mexico's production averages 2.5 million barrels a day, and abouthalf of it is exported to the United States. Japan, its principalcustomer in the Far East, buys about 180,000 barrels daily. Mexicoalso imports 56,000 barrels a day from the United States for itsnorthern border region to save transportation costs.   On Wednesday, Mexico reduced prices of its light Isthmus toWestern Europe and the United States, and its extra-light Olmec tothe United States by 10 cents a barrel, but kept the price of itsheavy Maya crude unchanged.   Olmec, which Mexico began producing in mid-1988, is sold only tothe United States.   Pemex establishes its prices by region, using a formula based onaverage prices on so-called world ``spot'' markets, where oil isauctioned to the highest bidder. But it sells only to fast customersunder contract of one year or more.   Thus, the price of Maya to the U.S. averaged $12.38 a barrelsduring the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged $15.86 andOlmec $16.80. In Western Europe, Maya averaged $11.52 and Isthmus$15.71 a barrel and in the Far East Maya averaged $12.20 and Isthmus$14.85, according to Pemex figures.</TEXT></DOC>
