The weather was blamed for at least 24 deaths, with nine inMissouri, including three people who collapsed after shoveling snow.   The storm caused millions of dollars in damage to poultryoperations in a four-state region as poultry houses collapsed underthe weight of the snow.   The bad weather also forced President Bush to cancel a trip todayto Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.   Up to 10 inches of snow kept some schools in southern Illinoisclosed today. Schools also were closed today in parts of Delaware,Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., because of icyroads.   A storm system over North Carolina brought rain and snow to theAtlantic seaboard early today. Snow extended from the mid-AtlanticCoast to southern New England and the Ohio Valley.   ``The ground is very wet and saturated,'' said Dennis Decker, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C.``It won't take much in the way of additional rain to produce aquick rise on some of the smaller creeks and streams.''   Rain caused flooding across southern West Virginia, closing roadsin 14 counties, and in Tennessee, about 120 families were forced toevacuate from along the swollen Cumberland and Harpeth rivers.   In Pennsylvania, the Monongahela River crested at 6.3 feet aboveflood stage this morning at Charleroi and also overflowed atBraddock, Elizabeth and McKeesport. ``There is some damage at theselevels, most often to warehouses or storage areas along the riverand roads,'' said weather service hydrologist Aldo Angelo.   The heaviest snowfalls _ 16 inches _ were recorded in parts ofMissouri and Oklahoma. Up to 10 inches covered the Laurel Mountainsof western Pennsylvania on Monday.   The Missouri Legislature canceled Monday's and this morning'ssessions because of the storm.   Nine inches of snow snarled traffic in Tulsa, Okla., promptingeven the intrepid U.S. Postal Service to call off most deliveriesMonday.   ``Today our rule of thumb is, if the carriers can deliver bywalking from the station they will. If they have to drive, forgetit,'' said Bob Hunt, director of city operations for the U.S. PostalService.   Ice on Interstate 35 north of Denton, Texas, caused a 20-milelong traffic tieup this morning.   Icy runways forced Cincinnati's Lunken Airport, which handlesmostly commuter and private flights, to continue diverting arrivingflights elsewhere.   The St. Louis area received 11 inches of snow, the third largestaccumulation for a 24-hour period in March since record-keepingbegan in 1874.   That prompted election officials in St. Louis to ask a judge topostpone today's primary for a week. The request was turned down byMunicipal Judge Evelyn Baker, who looked out an office window Mondayafternoon and noticed that the snow had stopped.   Government officials said reports indicated that as many as 700poultry houses in southwest Missouri, northwest Arkansas, northeastOklahoma and southeast Kansas were damaged.   ``This could be the single biggest disaster ever to hit thepoultry industry,'' said Lynch Butler, president of SimmonsIndustries Inc., of Siloam Springs, Ark., which processes about 1.5million chickens a week.   ``We've suffered major losses in summer heat waves, but I'm notaware of a single larger loss in terms of property and I've been inthis business for 20 years.''   Weather-related deaths included one in Georgia, five in Oklahoma,two in Ohio, one in Arkansas, two in Alabama, from a fire started bylightning, nine in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania and three inMaryland.   Icy pavement and blowing snow hampered travel in many areas. Theweather slowed commuters in the New York City area who had thoughtthey were home free Monday after a judge barred ``sympathy''walkouts by railroad workers in support of striking Eastern Airlinesworkers.   The weather service said 2.7 inches fell Monday in Newark, N.J.,breaking the record for the date of 2.4 inches set in 1943.</TEXT></DOC>
