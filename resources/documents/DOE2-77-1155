<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-1155 </DOCNO><TEXT>A review is presented of methods of calculating the bearing capacity andother properties of Arctic ice rubble. The calculations incorporate iceproperties that can be applied to the bearing capacity problem. However,it should be noted that the properties are based on model or small-scaletesting since little full-scale test data is available. Fragmented icezones are treated as granular material conforming to a Mohr-Coulomb criterionhaving friction angles ranging from 11 to 58 degrees. This method ofcalculating bearing capacity is valid for a short time only after theice is broken; significantly different results should be expected whenthe rubble refreezes. 36 refs., 13 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
