The notice stated that all but one ofthe companies investigated were found to have either no dumping marginsor <T3>de minimis </T3>dumping margins.Lawsuits were filed challenging various portions of the final determinationby petitioners and respondents. Petitioners alleged that Commerce's determinationwas unlawful, in part, because it contained certain computational and clericalerrors that affected the dumping margins for Kejriwal. Respondents contendedthat Commerce's affirmative determination with respect to Serampore wasunlawful because of certain clerical errors and because it was based uponan erroneous calculation of foreign market value.On November 25, 1987, April 27, 1988, and September 12, 1988, the Courtremanded the final determination to Commerce for correction of these errorsand for a redetermination of the dumping margins, if necessary. On March31, 1988, July 21, 1988 and November 25, 1988, Commerce issued remand resultsthat amended the final determination on certain iron construction castingsfrom India. Based on its recalculation of the dumping margins, Commercedetermined, in part, that Kejriwal's sales were at less than fair valueduring the period of investigation and that Serampore's dumping marginwas <T3>de minimis.</T3> These remand results were eventually affirmed by theCourt, in their entirety, as a result of rulings issued by it on September12, 1988, November 22, 1988 and February 10, 1989. <T3>Serampore Indus. v.

United States Dep't of Commerce,</T3> 13 CIT <T2>XX</T2>, Slip Op. 89-18 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with the Court's order of November 22, 1988, we are directingthe Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of castings fromIndia produced by Kejriwal, which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption, on or after the day after the date of publication of thisnotice in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> With respect to castings from Kejriwal, theCustoms Service shall require a cash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-averageamount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise subject tothe redetermination exceeds the United States price. The suspension ofliquidation will remain in effect until further notice.If the Court's order of February 10, 1989, regarding Serampore is not appealed,we will publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice directing the Customs Service to terminatethe suspension of liquidation, release any bond, refund any cash depositand proceed with the liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandiseproduced by Serampore without regard to antidumping duties.The weighted-average margins are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,8</C> <H1>Manufacturers/sellers/exporters</H1><H1>Weighted-average margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">RSI (<T3>de minimis</T3>) (excluded)<D>0.02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kejriwal<D>2.93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Serampore<D>0.82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kajaria (<T3>de minimis</T3>) (excluded)<D>0.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All Others<D>2.37</D></ITAG></ITAG>Article VI.5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that``[n]o product * * * shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailingduties to compensate for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.''This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Tariff Actof 1930, as amended. Since dumping duties cannot be assessed on the portionof the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no reason to requirea cash deposit for that amount. Accordingly, the level of certain exportsubsidies (as determined in the September 23, 1988, Amendment to FinalResults of Administrative Review of the Countervailing Duty Order on CertainIron-Metal Castings from India (51 FR 45788)) will be subtracted from theabove dumping margins for deposit purposes only on import of those constructioncastings covered by the countervailing duty order.<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan.
