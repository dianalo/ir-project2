This proposed rulemakingprovides supplemental proposals for the early- and late-season migratorybird hunting regulations frameworks. The early hunting seasons open prior to October 1 and include seasons onmourning, white-winged and white-tipped doves, band-tailed pigeons, woodcock,common snipe, rails, moorhens and gallinules, teal and sea ducks; experimentalSeptember duck seasons in Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, and Tennessee; experimentalSeptember Canada goose seasons in portions of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois;a special sandhill crane-Canada goose season in southwestern Wyoming; sandhillcranes in the Central and Pacific Flyways; migratory bird hunting seasonsin Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; and extended falconryseasons. Late seasons open about October 1 or later and include those formost waterfowl, and seasons not previously selected for other species.The Service annually prescribes hunting regulations frameworks within whichthe States select specific seasons.

Early seasons include those which open before October 1, whilelate seasons open about October 1 or later. Regulations are developed independentlyfor early and late seasons. The early-seasons regulations cover mourning,white-winged and white-tipped doves, band-tailed pigeons, rails, moorhensand gallinules, woodcock, and common snipe; sea ducks in the Atlantic Flyway;teal in September in the Central and Mississippi Flyways; experimentalSeptember duck seasons in Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, and Tennessee; experimentalSeptember Canada goose seasons in portions of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois;sandhill cranes in the Central and Pacific Flyways; a special sandhillcrane-Canada goose season in southwestern Wyoming; doves in Hawaii; migratorygame birds in Alaska, Puero Rico, and the Virgin Islands; and some extendedfalconry seasons. Late seasons include the general waterfowl seasons; specialseasons for scaup and goldeneyes; extra scaup and teal during regular duckseasons; coots, moorhens and gallinules, and snipe in the Pacific Flyway;and other extended falconry seasons. Certain general procedures are followed in developing regulations for theearly and late seasons. Initial regulatory proposals are announced in a<T4>Federal Register</T4> document published in March and opened to publiccomment. These proposals are supplemented, as necessary, with additional<T4>Rederal Register</T4> documents. Following review of comments receivedand after public hearings, the Service further develops and publishes proposedframeworks for times of seasons, season lengths, shooting hours, dailybag and possession limits, and other regulatory elements. After considerationof additional public comments, the Service publishes final frameworks inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Using these frameworks, State conservation agenciesthen select hunting season dates and options. Upon receipt of State selections,the Service publishes a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, amending Subpart K of 50 CFR Part 20, to establishspecific seasons, bag limits, and other regulations. The regulations becomeeffective upon publication. States may prescribe more restrictive seasonsthan those provided in the final frameworks.The regulations schedule for this year is as follows: On March 9, 1988,the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7702) a proposal to amend 50 CFR Part20, with public comment periods ending as noted above. The proposal dealtwith establishment of seasons, limits and other regulations for migratorygame birds under andSection;andSection; 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109 and 20.110of Subpart K. This document is the second in a series of proposed, supplemental,and final rules for migratory game bird hunting regulations. All commentson the March 9 proposal received through May 9, 1988, have been consideredin developing this document. Comment periods on this second document arespecified above under <T2>DATES</T2>. Final regulatory frameworks for migratory game bird huntingseasons for Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are targeted for<T4>Federal Register</T4> publication on or about July 27, 1988, and thosefor early seasons in other areas of the United States on August 10, 1988;and those for late seasons on September 16, 1988.On June 22, 1988, a public hearing will be held in Washington, DC, as announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 9, 1988, to review the status of mourningdoves, woodcock, band-tailed pigeons, white-winged and white-tipped doves,rails, moorhens and gallinules, common snipe, and sandhill cranes. Recommendedhunting regulations will be discussed for these species and for migratorygame birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; September tealseasons in the Mississippi and Central Flyways; experimental Septemberwaterfowl seasons in designated States; sea duck seasons in the AltanticFlyway; and extended falconry seasons. Statements or comments are invited.On August 3, 1988, a public hearing will be held in Washington, DC, asannounced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 9, 1988, to review the status and recommendedhunting regulations for waterfowl not previously discussed at the June22 public hearing.This supplemental proposed rulemaking describes a number of changes whichhave been proposed by commenters on the original framework proposals publishedon March 9, 1988, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Public Comments and the Service's Response</ITAG>Written Comments ReceivedAs of May 9, 1988, the Service had received comments on proposals publishedin the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 7702) from 48 correspondents, including7 State agencies, all four waterfowl flyway councils and 37 individuals.In some instances, the communications did not specifically mention theopen comment period or the regulatory proposals; however, because theywere received during the comment period and generally relate to migratorygame bird hunting regulations, they are treated as comments. The commentsare discussed below with particular attention to new proposals and modificationsor clarifications to previously described proposals. Wherever possible,they are discussed under headings corresponding to the numbered items inthe March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comments received subsequent to May 9, 1987,as well as those received at the June 22, 1988, public hearing will beaddressed in the next supplemental proposal targeted for publication inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>in early July.In the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 53 FR 7705), the data used in regulatorydecisions were outlined. At this time the Service does not have completedata from the spring breeding ground surveys but a preliminary assessmentof breeding habitat was released in mid-May. The habitat conditions arenot good and duck production may suffer. Restrictive duck regulations wereenacted in 1985 in response to reduced duck breeding populations and fallflights, and were continued in 1986 and 1987 in response to low duck breedingpopulations and poor production. The Service notes that if populationsneed additional protection, further framework restrictions, to includeoutside dates, season lengths and bag limits, will be considered in thedevelopment of regulations for the 1988-89 hunting season. In addition,all aspects of past regulations which may have a bearing on possible harvest,including various special seasons and options, will be reviewed. Dependingon full information from the May surveys, some actions will have to bedecided for early season regulations. The public hearing for early seasonsis scheduled for June 22, 1988.General CommentsThe Central Flyway Council has recommended adoption of the proposed basicregulations frameworks for 1988-89 hunting seasons on webless and waterfowlspecies pertinent to the Central Flyway except for specific recommendationsgiven in the numbered headings that follow.1. <T3>Shooting hours. </T3>a. An Illinois sportsman has recommended thatshooting hours for 1988-89 waterfowl hunting, including hunting programson State and Federal management areas, be standardized at 7:00 a.m. to3:30 p.m. The individual feels the recommended shooting hours would eliminatewaterfowl identification problems that may occur during poor light conditionsearly and late in the day, and would decrease the amount of time each daythat ducks are disturbed by hunters.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service has previously addressed the issue of shootinghours in an Environmental Assessment (EA), <T3>Proposed Shooting Hours Regulations</T3>, dated August 1, 1977. Basedon information in this EA and findings from a subsequent study, <T3>Shooting Activities of Waterfowl Hunters in Relation to Time of Day,and Abundance and Availability of Protected and Non-Protected Species ofBirds</T3>, it was concluded that early morning and late afternoon shootingof protected species was inconsequential. There has been no new informationdeveloped that indicates present shooting hours are harmful to the resource.Shooting hours of one-half hour before sunrise have been in effect duringmost years since 1918, when Federal establishment of migratory bird regulationsbegan. The Service intends to continue the present shooting hours framework.2. <T3>Framework for ducks in the conterminous United States_outside dates,season length and bag limits. </T3>a. An Illinois sportsman has recommendedthat the 1988-89 regulatory frameworks for duck hunting permit a 50-daysplit season and that the point values in the point-system be revised togive more protection to the hens of most species and eliminate the accidentaltaking of protected species.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service will consider these recommendations whenthe late-season frameworks are developed in early August.b. A Minnesota and a Louisiana sportsman have each recommended that thepoint-system bag-limit option be eliminated, and an individual from Vermonturges the Service to shorten the duck hunting season and reduce the dailybag limit.<T3>Response. </T3>These recommendations will be considered by the Servicein early August when the late-season frameworks are developed.3. <T3>American black ducks. </T3>a. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheriesand Wildlife submitted comments on the four regulatory options for harvestmanagement of black ducks that were noted in the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 53 FR 7708). Massachusetts indicated thatalthough they believed further harvest restrictions will be necessary toincrease black duck population levels, the 1987-88 regulatory frameworksshould be continued in 1988-89 while Canada completes its 5-year harvestreduction program, and then both countries can develop a joint harvestreduction plan.b. New Jersey, in commenting on the four regulatory options for black duckharvest management, expressed support for continuation of current restrictiveframeworks.<T3>Response. </T3>These recommendations will be considered in early Augustwhen the late-season frameworks are developed.4. <T3>Wood ducks. </T3>a. In the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 7708), the Service outlined the regulationsof recent years that permit southeastern States the option of selectingan early October duck season with no special wood duck bag limit restrictions.In that document the Service noted such seasons and bag limits were underreview because the effect of such seasons on wood ducks is not well known.At a February 1988 symposium addressing wood duck status and managementthe Service indicated that preseason banding programs are not presentlymeeting required sample sizes to evaluate proposed or existing specialseasons on a State by State basis. In the absence of an adequate data base,the Service feels wood duck harvest management should exist on a broaderbasis. The Service reaffirms its interest in wood duck management and willpropose a program to gather information needed to address questions ofharvest, recruitment and survival of wood ducks. The Service asks the Atlanticand Mississippi Flyway Councils to review existing harvest strategies andgive consideration to their proper evaluation.8. <T3>Experimental September duck season. </T3>a. At its March meeting theLower Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council endorseda recommendation for the continuation of the experimental September duckseasons in Kentucky and Tennessee for 1988. The Committee indicated thatcontinuation of these seasons would permit further evaluation of the reductionin the wood duck bag limits prescribed in 1986 and 1987, and added thatKentucky recently initiated a research project that should provide additionalinsight on the effects of the early season on local wood ducks.<T3>Response. </T3>As noted earlier in this document, preliminary resultsof the waterfowl breeding ground surveys and the depressed status of waterfowlpopulations may require review of harvest management strategies such asSeptember duck seasons. The Service will consider this recommendation whenthe early-season frameworks are developed in late June.12. <T3>Canvasback and redhead ducks. </T3>a. At its March meeting the AtlanticFlyway Council endorsed a recommendation requesting the Service to completeits review of the final report on the Flyway's experimental canvasbackseasons (1983-1985) in order that the harvest strategy can be consideredwhen the canvasback population increases and is able to support a huntingseason.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service will complete its review of the final reporton the Atlantic Flyway's experimental canvasback seasons (1983-85).Recommendations to develop a North American canvasback management planhave recently been made. The Service believes this may be the proper approachto developing an international harvest strategy for canvasbacks. Ways toaccomplish this task are being explored.13. <T3>Duck zones. </T3>The question of the proper flyway alignment of theState of Louisiana with respect to waterfowl management has been pendingfor several years. The Service believes this issue should be resolved priorto the opening of the 1988 waterfowl hunting season. Louisiana has beenconsidered a Mississippi Flyway State since the flyway-management systemwas established in 1948. However, results of cooperative studies conductedby the Service and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries during1975-81 indicated that a substantial proportion of ducks wintering in westernLouisiana migrates through the Central Flyway, but there are marked differencesamong species in the proportions received from each flyway. Further, awide variety of species are important in the Louisiana duck harvest, mostof which are lightly harvested in comparison with the mallard. Two basicissues exit_the question of proper flyway affinity of ducks that winteror migrate through Louisiana, and whether the varied bag of formerly lightlygunned and abundant species warranted special regulations in western Louisiana.One confounding problem, however, is that the source of the mallards throughoutLouisiana is the heavily gunned Mississippi Flyway birds.These studies led to the establishment of two experimental zones in Louisiana_awestern zone and an eastern zone. Since 1975 the season length in the experimentalwestern zone has been 5 days longer than that provided for the rest ofthe Mississippi Flyway, while the entire State has been governed by MississippiFlyway bag limits. In 1984 (49 FR 22420) the Service proposed to establish,beginning in 1985, a permanent west zone in Louisiana with Central Flywayseason length while retaining Mississippi Flyway bag limits statewide.Most responses opposed such a change on the grounds that it would increasean already large duck harvest in Louisiana.Subsequent to the initiation of the study, populations of many duck species,particularly mallards, pintails and blue-winged teal, have declined tovery low levels and do not appear likely to recover quickly. The duck harvestin Louisiana has grown markedly since the cooperative studies began, toa point where sustained additional harvest may be detrimental to the long-termwelfare of breeding stocks. Some of this additional harvest has resultedfrom regulatory changes made by the Service to provide additional recreationalopportunity directed at lightly-harvested species such as pintails andblue-winged teal. These and other species have declined, and the Servicebelieves that continuation of such management strategies is no longer appropriate,and will review a number of such strategies over time. Since 1985, theService's efforts have focused on reducing harest and it appears that suchan objective may be a necessary part of waterfowl management until populationsrecover.The depressed population of many duck species and a full review of migratorybird harvest management practices have changed the Service's position onthe west zone of Louisiana. The issue has been evaluated in the Draft SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement on the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permittingthe Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS) which should be available infinal form by July 1988. The SEIS reaffirms that the administrative flyways,while not biologically precise, are appropriate and disirable units foreffective management of waterfowl, and that not all the complexities ofdifferences in affinities of migratory birds can be accommodated by regulations.In summary, because of the depressed status of several duck species, reducedreproductive capacity of their breeding habitats, and an increase in theoverall impact of Louisiana's duck harvest on Mississippi and Central Flywayduck populations, the Service will henceforth consider Louisiana as partof the Mississippi Flyway for the purpose of waterfowl management.14. <T3>Frameworks for geese and brant in the conterminous United States_outsidedates, season length and bag limits. </T3>a. The Atlantic Flyway Councilendorsed the following recommendations at its March meeting:i. That 1988-89 regulatory frameworks for Atlantic brant be establishedto provide for a 50-day season and a 2-bird daily bag limit pending anevaluation of the 1988 brant production. The Council noted that the 1987-88season frameworks allowed a 30-day season and 2 brant daily, but indicatedthat the 1988 winter count of brant increased and the birds should arriveon the breeding grounds in excellent shape because sea lettuce, the species'major food, was very abundant this past winter. Unless there is extremelypoor brant production in 1988 the Council believes the recommended frameworksare justified.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service defers action on the recommendation untilthe late-season frameworks are developed in early August, at which timemore information about the status of Atlantic brant will be available.ii. That the regulatory frameworks for snow geese in the Atlantic Flywaybe stabilized at the current level of 90 days and 4 snow geese daily untilsuch time that the status of the population or biological investigationwarrants a review.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes the regulatory frameworks for AtlanticFlyway snow geese have been unchanged for many years, but believes actionon the request to stabilize the frameworks should be deferred until a harvestmanagement plan for Atlantic Flyway snow geese is developed and approved.b. The Upper Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Councilendorsed a recommendation at its March meeting that Indiana be permittedto eliminate two mandatory check-stations in its Posey County harvest zonefor Mississippi Valley Population Canada geese. The State has indicatedthat of the total Posey County harvest during the past 3 seasons, HoveyLake has averaged 94 percent and therefore the total kill for the harvestzone can be extrapolated solely from the known harvest at the Hovey Lakecheck-station.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service supports the request to use only the HoveyLake check-station to estimate the Posey County harvest of Canada geesebut will consider all comments received.c. The Lower Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Councilendorsed the following recommendations at its March meeting:1. That the 1987-88 snow goose season regulatory frameworks for Arkansas,including a January 31 framework closing date, be continued in 1988-89,and the 1988-89 regulatory frameworks for white-fronted geese in Arkansaspermit the State's season to run concurrent with its snow goose seasonpending evaluation of the status and production information for mid-continentwhite-fronted geese.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service defers action on the recommendations untilthe late-season frameworks are developed in early August, at which timemore information about the status of snow geese and white-fronted geesewill be available. With respect to the recommendation regarding whitefronts,the Service notes that the mid-continent white-fronted goose populationis shared by the Mississippi and Central Flyways and that mid-winter andspring surveys indicate this population may be declining in part of itsrange; therefore, this recommendation should be discussed by both FlywayCouncils.ii. That the 1987-88 regulatory frameworks that included Arkansas in theharvest allocation procedures for Mississippi Valley Population of Canadageese and prescribed a January 31 framework closing date be continued in1988-89.<T3>Response. </T3>Service action on this recommendation is deferred untilthe late-season frameworks are developed in early August, at which timemore information about the status of Canada geese will be available.d. An Illinois sportsman has recommended that the 1988-89 regulatory frameworksfor hunting Canada geese permit a split season concurrent with the duckseason and extending through early January.<T3>Response. </T3>This recommendation will be considered by the Servicewhen late-season frameworks are developed in early August.e. A group of landowners and sportsmen from the mid-Willamette Valley ofOregon has requested a change in the regulatory frameworks for huntinggeese in western Oregon that would allow hunting from December 1 throughFebruary 15. This late season is requested to help reduce late-winter goosedepredations.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service defers action on this request pending receiptof additional comments. Regulatory frameworks for hunting geese in Oregonwill be developed in early August.f. In a <T4>Federal Register </T4>document dated July 2, 1987 (at 52 FR 25174)the Service mentioned criteria were being developed for special residentCanada goose seasons but focused only on those criteria for early Canadagoose seasons. In the intervening period additional discussions of criteriafor the special seasons have occurred at flyway council and technical sectionmeetings. Special experimental early Canada goose seasons have been establishedin Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois. A Memorandum of Agreement betweenthe Service and each State was established for each of these seasons. TheseMemoranda of Agreement contain criteria that the Service intends to useto evaluate future special early seasons. These criteria are:1. A State may hold a Canada goose season of up to 10 consecutive daysbetween September 1 and September 10_this is in addition to its regularseason.2. During the September season the daily bag and possession limits maybe no more than 5 and 10 Canada geese, respectively.3. The area(s) open to hunting will be described in State regulations.4. Provisions for discontinuing, extending or modifying the season willbe included in the Memorandum of Agreement.5. The evaluation required of the State will be incorporated in the Memorandumof Agreement and will include at the least the following:i. Neck-collar observations and population surveys beginning a year priorto the requested season and continuing during the experiment.ii. Determine derivation of neck-collar codes from observations and harvestedgeese.iii. Collect morphological information from harvested geese to ascertainprobable source population(s) of harvest.iv. Analyze band recovery data.v. Analyze hunter activity and estimate harvest.vi. Prepare annual and final reports of the study.Efforts are still underway to develop criteria for special late Canadagoose seasons.g. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended a change in the regulatory frameworksfor brant seasons in Alaska. This recommendation is responded to in item25.15. <T3>Tundra swans. </T3>a. The Atlantic Flyway Council has endorsed thehunt plan for Eastern Population tundra swans and in accordance with thatplan has recommended that North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey be allowedto participate in special-permit swan hunts. Permit quotas would be 6,000,600 and 200, respectively, for North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey.In addition, New Jersey and Virginia have submitted copies of their proposalsfor an experimental swan season. New Jersey indicated the season wouldbe limited to Salem, Cumberland and Burlington Counties, and only 200 permitswould be issued with an anticipated harvest of less than 60 swans. Virginiaproposes a 90-day season concurrent with its snow goose season; 600 permitswould be issued with an expected harvest of 300 swans.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service also is reviewing recommendations from thePacific, Central and Mississippi Flyway Councils regarding the hunt planfor Eastern Population tundra swans. Action on the Atlantic Flyway Council'srecommendation regarding swan hunting seasons in North Carolina, Virginiaand New Jersey, and on the proposals from New Jersey and Virginia is deferreduntil early August at which time regulatory frameworks for tundra swanhunting seasons will be developed.b. At its March meeting, the Pacific Flyway Council endorsed Montana'sproposal to add four counties to the two counties in the Pacific Flywayarea of the State in which tundra swans are hunted. Hill, Liberty, Tooleand Pondera Counties are recommended to be added to Teton and Cascade Counties,but the number of permits authorized (500) would not increase.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service will consider this recommendation when theregulatory frameworks for tundra swan seasons are developed in early August.c. Twenty-five individuals have submitted comments urging the Service notto permit sport hunting of swans.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service will consider these comments when the frameworksfor tundra swan hunting are developed in early August.d. The Pacific Flyway Council endorsed a proposed experimental tundra swanhunting season on Alaska's Seward Peninsula. This recommendation is respondedto in item 25.16. <T3>Sandhill cranes. </T3>a. The Pacific and Central Flyway Councils recommendedthat the experimental sandhill crane hunting season in New Mexico's MiddleRio Grande Valley be continued in 1988-89.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes both Councils' recommendations. Regulatoryframeworks for 1988-89 sandhill crane hunting seasons will be developedin late June.b. The Central Flyway Council has recommended that the sandhill crane huntingseason in the Hatch-Deming area of New Mexico (portions of Sierra, Lunaand Dona Ana Counties) be granted operational status (up to 350 permits;3 cranes daily and 9 per season; not to exceed 30 days between September1 and January 31).In a separate but related action the Central Flyway Council has recommendedthat an exception to the outside framework dates of September 1 and November30, as called for in the Pacific and Central Flyway Management Plan forRocky Mountain Population Sandhill Cranes, be made for Sierra, Luna andDona Ana Counties of New Mexico. The outside frameworks for these threecounties would be September 1 and January 31. The exception is requestedin order to accommodate the Hatch-Deming area sandhill crane hunt in southwestNew Mexico noted above.The Pacific Flyway Council has recommended that New Mexico be permittedto conduct a sandhill crane hunting season in the Hatch-Deming area withthe following stipulations:i. Both New Mexico hunts combined (Middle Rio Grande Valley and Hatch-Deming)be designed to harvest no more than 749 Rocky Mountain Population sandhillcranes.ii. The harvest rate of greater sandhill cranes should be assumed to be35 percent until data prove otherwise.iii. Data relative to racial composition of the harvest will be collected.iv. If needed, the season length will be adjusted by New Mexico to complywith the 30-day season framework in the joint management plan for RockyMountain Population sandhill cranes.<T3>Response. </T3>Service action on this requested season is deferreduntil the proposed frameworks for hunting sandhill cranes are developedin early June.c. The Pacific Flyway Council recommends Wyoming's proposal to eliminatehunting Canada geese in the Bear River area and to reduce the number ofpermits in its Salt River sandhill crane-Canada goose hunt area from 60to 40.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes the Pacific Flyway Council's recommendation.d. In 1987 the Service approved frameworks recommendations from the Centraland Pacific Flyway Councils for operational seasons for hunting sandhillcranes within the range of the Rocky Mountain Population in Arizona, Colorado,Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming (See August 6, 1987, 52 FR29194). The Pacific Flyway Council has give notice that Utah, in accordancewith those frameworks, will initiate experimental sandhill crane seasonsin Rich and Cache Counties, September 3-5, and September 10-12, 1988. Fiftypermits, allowing the take of 1 sandhill crane per season, will be issuedfor each county. The Central Flyway Council endorses the Utah season.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes Utah's intent to initiate an experimentalsandhill crane season in 1988-89.e. Montana has alerted the Service that it is considering requesting achange in its sandhill crane hunting season that would allow crane huntingin the area south of Interstate Highway 90 and west of the Bighorn River.<T3>Response</T3>. The Service notes Montana's request is tentative pendingapproval by the Central and Pacific Flyway Councils and the State's Fishand Game Commission.17. <T3>Coots.</T3> a. At its March meeting the Mississippi Flyway Council'sUpper Region Regulations Committee adopted a recommendation that the regulatoryframeworks for coot hunting be concurrent with the regulatory frameworksfor the regular duck season only. The Committee indicated that permittinghunters to take coots during special duck hunting seasons would only providehunters increased opportunity to accidentally or willfully harvest otherspecies illegally. <T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes the Committee's recommendation.b. The Central Flyway Council has recommended the regulatory frameworksfor coot hunting coincide with all duck hunting seasons, including Septemberteal seasons and other special duck seasons.<T3>Response. </T3>A similar recommendation from the Central Flyway Councilwas addressed by the Service in the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 53 FR 7710). The Service reiterates its intentto continue to limit the taking of coots in the regular duck seasons only.21. <T3>Woodcock. </T3>a. Pennsylvania has submitted comments recommendingthat the Service continue the 1987-88 frameworks for hunting woodcock inthe Eastern Region (Atlantic Flyway States) in 1988-89. The State alsorecommends that the framework closing date for hunting woodwock throughoutthe U.S. be no later than January 31.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service will consider these recommendations whenthe proposed frameworks for woodcock hunting are developed in late June.22. <T3>Band-tailed pigeons.</T3> a. The Pacific Flyway Council has recommendedthe following:i. The framework opening date for hunting Pacific Coast Population band-tailedpigeons be delayed from September 7 to September 14 during the remaining2 years of the scheduled 3-year harvest reduction program.<T3>Response.</T3> The Service will consider this recommendation when theearly-season frameworks are developed in late June.ii. The regulatory frameworks for 1988-89 hunting seasons for Four-CornersPopulation band-tailed pigeons be the same as those of 1987-88.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes the Council's recommendation.23. <T3>Mourning doves.</T3>Western Management Unit (WNU).a. The Pacific Flyway Council recommends that all WMU States, except Arizonaand California be offered only 30-consecutive day hunting seasons, betweenSeptember 1 and 30, 1988, and that Arizona and California be offered only60-day seasons to be split between two periods, September 1-15, 1988, andNovember 1, 1988-January 15, 1989.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service recognizes these recommended changes wouldeffect a change in the experimental 3-year season established last year.The proposed regulations would in effect create submanagement units inthe WMU. The recommendation will be further examined when the early-seasonframeworks are considered in late June.24.<T3> White-winged and white-tipped doves.</T3> a. The Pacific Flyway Councilrecommends that the framework for white-winged doves in Arizona providea season not to exceed 30 days, to be concurrent with the mourning doveseason; and that frameworks for whitewings in Nevada and California providefor a season concurrent in length and timing with the mourning dove season.<T3>Response. </T3> The Council's recommendation will be considered bythe Service in late June when the early-season frameworks are developed.b. In the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7712) the Service gave notice of Texas'request that the 1988-89 regulatory frameworks permit an aggregate dailybag limit of 12 white-winged, mourning and white-tipped doves to includeno more than 2 white-tipped doves during the Sepcial 4-day white-wingeddove season in Texas. At its March meeting, the Central Flyway Counciladopted a recommendation supporting Texas' requests.<T3>Response</T3>. The Service notes that the early September season insouth Texas was developed as a white-winged dove season. It is also notedthat white-winged doves in south Texas experienced a serious populationdecline following a freeze of citrus nesting habitat during the winterof 1983-84. Populations have not yet fully recovered and regulations relaxationis not thought to be warranted at present. The regular mourning dove seasonin south Texas begins on September 20 and continues for 66 days. Althoughconcurrent hunting of mourning doves has been permitted during the specialwhitewing season in the past, a large harvest of mourning doves has resultedduring a period (early September) when many individuals of this speciesare still nesting in south Texas. The current limitation of 2 mourningdoves in an aggregate bag of 10 doves has significantly reduced the mourningdove harvest during early September in 1984-87. Previous experience predictsthat a large mourning dove harvest will result during the special whitewinghunt under the Texas proposal. The Service believes that a large mourningdove harvest in early September is not in the best interest of the species.25. <T3>Migratory bird hunting seasons in Alaska</T3> a. The Pacific FlywayCouncil has forwarded its endorsement of the following to the Service:i. Alaska's request for reinstatement of a 107-day season length frameworkfor brant hunting seasons. The framework was reduced to 50 days in 1987and the State has indicated the action did little to reduce harvest whileadding complexity to the regulations. The Service has also received a formalrequest from Alaska for the framework change.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service notes that brant populations have declinedin the Pacific Flyway over the long-term and special efforts have beenmade to limit subsistence harvest of these birds in western Alaska. Despitethe fact the shortened season may have done little to reduce the harvest,the Service questions whether a 57 day increase in season length in Alaskawould be understood by Alaskan subsistence hunters, U.S. sport huntersor wildlife management officials in Mexico. The Service proposes to continuethe current season length of 50 days for brant in Alaska.ii. Alaska's proposal for a tundra swan season in its Game Management Unit22 (Seward Peninsula). The State would issue 300 permits allowing eachpermittee 1 swan per season. The Service has also received a formal requestfrom the State for the experimental season.<T3>Response. </T3>This proposal will be further examined by the Servicein late June when the frameworks for migratory bird hunting in Alaska aredeveloped.27. <T3>Migratory game birds seasons for falconers</T3> a. In the March 9,1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7713) the Service gave notice of and solicitedcomments on a request that the outside framework dates for special falconryseasons be expanded. At its March meeting, the Pacific Flyway Council adopteda recommendation endorsing the request. In addition, eight individuals(MD-1, NC-1, IL-1, NM-1, ME-1, OR-1, NV-2) and one State (WA) submittedcomments expressing support for the frameworks change. One of the individualsalso supported zoning for falconry seasons and the use of falcons duringSeptember teal seasons.<T3>Response. </T3>The Service continues to seek additional informationor comments on this request. All comments will be considered in late Junewhen the early-season frameworks are developed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Invited</ITAG>Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress andwith due consideration for any data or views submitted by interested parties,the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemaking willspecify open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits fordesignated migratory game birds in the United States, including Alaska,Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.The Director intends that finally adopted rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests. He therefore desires to obtain the commentsand suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, andprivate interests on these proposals and will take into consideration thecomments received. Such comments, and any additional information received,may lead the Director to adopt final regulations that differ from theseproposals. The addresses where comments should be sent and where receivedcomments are available for public inspection were given earlier in thisdocument under the caption <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>.Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulationswhich limit the amount of time that the Service can allow for public comment.Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemakingprocess must operate: the need, on the one hand, to establish final rulesat a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agenciesto appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms, and,on the other hand, the unavailability before mid-June of specific, reliabledata on this year's status of some migratory shore and upland game birdpopulations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow comment periodspast the dates specified earlier is contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Flyway Council Meetings</ITAG>Department of the Interior representatives will be present at the followingmeetings of Flyway Councils:<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Atlantic Flyway</T3>_Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Sutton Place Hotel)July 28-29<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Mississippi Flyway</T3>_Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Hilton) July 29-30<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Central Flyway</T3>_Calgary, Alberta, Canada (Marlboro Inn) July 28-29<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Pacific Flyway</T3>_Reno, Nevada (Sundowner Hotel) July 28Although agendas are not yet available, these meetings usually commenceat 8:30 or 9 a.m. on the days indicated.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration</ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES 75-54)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice ofavailability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 13, 1975 (40 FR 25241). In addition,several environmental assessments have been prepared on specific matterswhich serve to supplement the material in the Final Environmental Statement.Copies of these documents are available from the Service at the addressindicated under the caption <T2>ADDRESS</T2>. As noted in the March 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 53 FR 7707), the Service released a draftsupplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) on the FES in September1987. The Service has reviewed the comments received on the draft SEISand anticipates the final SEIS will be available by July 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration</ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that ``The Secretary shallreview other programs administered by him and utilize such programs infurtherance of the purposes of this Act,'' [and shall] ``insure that anyaction authorized, funded, or carried out . . . is not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of such endangered or threatened species or resultin the destruction or modification of [critical] habitat . . .''Section 7 consultations are presently underway regarding both the early-and late-season regulatory proposals. It is possible that the findingsfrom the consultation, which will be included in a biological opinion,may cause modification of some of the regulatory measures proposed in thisdocument. Any modifications that may be desirable will be reflected inthe final frameworks for Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; thosefor other early seasons; and those for late seasons.Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviatechances of conflict between seasons for migatory game birds and the protectionand conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats.The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation underSection 7 are considered public documents and are available for publicinspection in the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation,and the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 9, 1988, (53 FR 7707), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order.
