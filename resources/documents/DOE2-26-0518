The experiments have been performed on thallium nP/sub 3/2/states (n = 8, 9 and n = 8-11 respectively). By appropriate choice ofthe polarization and direction of incident light - and, thereby, of thetwo-photon transition operator - the signal ratio of neighbouring {Delta}m= 2 crossings is altered. Thus, in the case of overlapping crossingsimproved resolution can be obtained without further efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
