The youthful Chinese artists, known as ``The Stars,'' gainedprominence in 1979 when they marched through Beijing to protestpolice interference in a show they had set up without officialapproval.   The authorities gave in and permitted the exhibition,unprecedented in Communist China, which featured once-forbiddentopics such as nudes, abstracts and works of aesthetic rather thanpolitical content.   After a 1980 show, however, the 30-member group disbanded. Whilesome remained active in Beijing, others settled in Europe, Japan andthe United States.   The retrospective, featuring the work of 12 group members, openedFriday and is scheduled to run five weeks before moving to Taipei,Taiwan, and Paris.   Before ``The Stars,'' ``earlier art was all the same,'' saidsculptor Wang Keping, one of six members in Hong Kong for theexhibition. ``The Stars'' showed artistic activity in China need notbe organized or approved by the ruling party, he said.   Individuality was the driving force behind the group, saidgallery owner Chang Tsong-zung, who organized the retrospective.   ``The only common aim of the artists when they first started wasthat they wanted to be different from each other.''   Bo Yun, a teacher at Beijing's Academy of Arts and Design whoseabstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, claimsartistic freedom in China has advanced since the group's 1979exhibition though limitations remain.   There is no problem, he said, ``if you use a work of art tosatirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock thegovernment, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.''   ``The Stars'' also say Beijing no longer allows them to exhibitas a group, thwarting attempts in 1983 and 1986. The reason,believes Bo, is that the group's name has become a symbol of thedemocracy movement.   The retrospective includes works from the late 1970s, includingWang's Buddha-like bust of Chairman Mao Tse-tung signifying thedeification of the Communist leader during the ultraleftist 1966-76Cultural Revolution. It is called ``The Idol.''   Other pieces adopt current themes, including the mixed-media work``Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features a prophylactic attached to arain coat.   The works, which cost up to several thousand dollars, are asdifferent as the paths the artists have taken since they disbanded.   Wang, 39, a soft-spoken man with a small goatee, moved to Parisin 1984, convinced he could not develop further in China largelybecause of political pressure.   ``Art freedom is only possible in a democratic country with humanrights,'' he said.   Wang recently wrote a play titled, ``The Retrial of WeiJingsheng,'' who led a pro-democracy movement in China before beingsentenced to a 15-year prison term in 1979.   Bo, 40, has remained in Beijing, supplementing his $40 monthlysalary by selling his paintings to foreigners and at overseasexhibits.   Other ``Stars'' on display in the retrospective include Huang Ruiand Ma Desheng, the two leaders of the group, and Li Shuang, who wasarrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-educationfor ``incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she wasliving with a French diplomat but had yet to marry him.   Although ``The Stars'' have scattered across the globe they havestayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 wasforged ``a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, Bo said.</TEXT></DOC>
