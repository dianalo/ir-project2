But he'd like to interview Elvis Costello, rocker bytrade.   That may sound like a clash of cultures, but it ain'tnecessarily so, says Susan Lester, TV producer by trade.   ``Michael is going to be a correspondent on some pieces,'' shesays, ``and I'd like to put him together with the kind of artistyou wouldn't normally see him with.''   Lester's show is the ``Arts andamp; Entertainment Revue,'' a weeklyone-hour cable series that quietly opened for business last spring.It's a show of arts and letters in a time of bottom lines andciphers.   Shown twice Friday nights on the Arts andamp; Entertainment Network,and repeated again Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings, ``Revue''is close in spirit to ``Omnibus,'' the acclaimed cultural seriesthat appeared on all three networks in the 1950s and '60s.   By sheer coincidence, Lester also was senior producer of thelast network incarnation of ``Omnibus,'' a 1988 special she did forABC News, where she worked 10 years before moving to cable inJanuary.   The major difference in ``Revue,'' hosted by Eric Burns, is thatit tries to be timely, a cultural newsmagazine.   Each program is a showcase for art, music, films, television,theater, dance, pop culture and literature, says Lester, broughtover from ABC by former ABC vice president Av Westin, executiveproducer of ``Revue.''   But current cultural news also is a key element, says Lester,who doesn't finish each show until two days before it airs. ``We'renot trying to be news up to the second,'' she says. ``But wewouldn't want to be a whole week behind.''   As an example, she says, one show did what amounts to a primeron the flap touched off by the Robert Mapplethorpe homoerotic photoexhibits when that controversy was making headlines.   This summer, the larger topic of art and obscenity in moderntimes will get the once-over, she says.   ``Revue,'' which costs less than $150,000 a show, has an initial26-week order. The Arts andamp; Entertainment Network, which serves 44million homes, started airing the show May 4.   The debut episode spotlighted Broadway producer Harold Prince,who has a record 16 Tony Awards, reporting on his efforts to keepmusical theater alive. The Neville Brothers showed off the NewOrleans Jazz Festival in the next show.   In another edition, Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca reminisced about``Your Show of Shows.'' There also was a report on an unusual kindof rock video _ with closed-captioning for the hearing-impaired.   Other segments have included veteran dancer Edward Villellaconducting a tour of his alma mater, the School of American Ballet;a story on a PBS special saluting the music of the late ``SesameStreet'' composer Joe Raposo; and a piece on a new home-videooffering, ``Who's Afraid of Opera?,'' designed for kids and hostedby Joan Sutherland.   Tonight's show has Feinstein singing four little-known Gershwinsongs, including a beautiful ballad, ``Will You Remember Me?,''that he says originally was written as an uptempo song.   It was cut from a Gershwin musical, ``Lady Be Good,'' and hasgone unheard until now, says Feinstein, who for six years worked asan archivist for the late Ira Gershwin, the lyric-writing half ofthe Gershwin brothers.   Feinstein, who appeared on Lester's ``Omnibus'' special in 1988,is far removed from the world of rock.   His is the world of the fine old standards and lushorchestrations that were revived in Woody Allen's ``Manhattan'' andagain in ``When Harry Met Sally ...''   But he doesn't think it odd that as a guest correspondent hemight eventually interview Elvis Costello, whom he met this year.For starters, one Costello album features a cover of ``My FunnyValentine.''   ``He was telling me about how he was influenced by Peggy Lee andFrank Sinatra records, and by the lyrics of Ira Gershwin,''Feinstein says. ``A lot of (rock) artists are inspired by the OldGuard ... I hear that intermittently.''   Producer Lester doesn't find it odd, either, to have the sort ofshow in which, say, Monet and Madonna, or Dick Tracy and E.L.Doctorow, can peacefully coexist.   It's all part of life's rich cultural parade, she says, ``andnone of it is mutually exclusive. ... I don't think people dividethem up that way.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...   FIVE QUANTUM LEAPS FOR MANKIND?: As a public service, NBC willrun repeats of the one-hour series ``Quantum Leap'' all next week,from Monday through Friday at 10 p.m. EDT. The idea of this unusualprogramming ploy, an NBC spokesman says, is to give the showgreater exposure than it got last season. The network hopes thiswill make a lot of viewers regular fans when the series starts itsnew Friday night slot next season.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri PMs, June 22</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
