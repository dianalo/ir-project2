But with the other perquisites around Capitol Hill, taxpayerscan be assured their representatives would not have suffered evenif they had given up the speeches and political money pots withoutan offsetting raise.   The current salary of $89,500 goes pretty far when yourhaircuts, gymnasium, parking, travel, meals, mail, insurance,retirement and telephone bills are subsidized by the Treasury.   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader _ who believes members of Congressshould be paid about the same as their constituents, instead ofbeing in the top 1 percent income bracket _ once portrayed thesystem as ``imperial legislators with their self-contained court offavors.''   With the pay raise, the House members beginning in 1991 willhave to give up the most profitable of those favors, the speechhonoraria. Many senior lawmakers for years have been padding theirincomes by up to 30 percent that way.   The Senate voted to give itself only a 10 percent pay raise, andto keep taking the speech money for now. The result is that theHouse and Senate incomes will remain roughly comparable, at morethan $120,000 by 1991.   Like executives in the private sector, salary is just part ofthe remuneration package.   The National Taxpayers Union says the new pay package means thatmore than half of the House will be ``pension millionaires.'' Thatis, once the pay hikes take effect, they can be expected to collectmore than $1 million in benefits during their lives.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley could expect to receive a pensionof $99,199 a year.   That's on top of whatever he may have put into the House 401Kplan, a tax-deferred retirement system that many companies makeavailable to employees in the private sector.   Congress lets its members put away up to 10 percent of theirincomes, and taxpayers match the first 5 percent.   Members get health insurance like other federal employees, plusmore personal and immediate attention if they so desire.   The Attending Physician's office provides doctors, nurses andtechnicians who can take x-rays, dispense drugs, give allergy andimmunization shots and perform other services.   Staying in shape is convenient at the Senate Health Club and theHouse gymnasium. The Senate has an indoor tennis court; the Househas a swimming pool, handball, volleyball and basketball court anda steam room.   Members pay half the cost of their $78,000 life insurancepolicies.   Lawmakers don't get Christmas bonuses, but they often takegovernment or privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips during theholidays.   Those inclined toward helping the disadvantaged have visiteddesolate areas of Africa, sometimes with tragic results such as thedeath earlier this year of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, on anairplane flight to a refugee camp.   Others have been less inclined to rough it. The Paris Air Showis one of the annual pilgrimages for many members of Congress.   Everything around the Capitol is geared toward making lawmakersfeel like they own the place.   The subsidized barber shops and beauty salons cater to theirneeds at discount prices. There's a private movie theater, and gunenthusiasts have access to the Capitol Police firing range.   Works from the National Gallery of Art decorate their offices,and the Library of Congress is at their beck and call.   Separate elevators are reserved for members only, and althoughmost are automatic, they carry operators so members don't have topush their own buttons.   The restaurants have private dining rooms open to only membersand their guests. If they get tired of the food, which is ratherbland, they are allowed to take as many meals as they want fromlobbyists.   There's talk that many senior House members will retire ratherthan run again in 1992, because after that they will no longer beallowed to keep for personal use the money in their campaignchests. In some cases that's more than $1 million.   But for the most part, members of Congress run for re-electionagain and again, and would have kept doing so even if theirsalaries didn't reach six figures any time soon.</TEXT></DOC>
