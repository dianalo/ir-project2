They also wonder whether the dollar's fall against the yen and West German mark Friday indicates a new willingness to push the U.S. unit lower and test central bankers' determination to support it.    &quot;It's a confused market,&quot; Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said.    She and other analysts this week will be trying to determine the impact of several events: the announcement of the new British government budget tomorrow, the approach of the March 31 end of Japan's fiscal year, central banks' unexpected willingness so far to intervene to keep their currencies from rising too far against the dollar and growing worries about Third World debt.    In late Friday trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.8520 West German marks and 152.41 Japanese yen, a decline from 1.8590 marks and 153.38 yen Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.5760 from $1.5875 the day before.    Traders attributed the pound's decline to profit-taking as well as to talk of another possible cut in British interest rates and traders' unwinding of long, or overbought, pound positions in advance of the budget message. Dealers also remained wary of trying to push the currency higher after some suspected intervention by the Bank of England last week to stem its rise.    Sterling's biggest fall came against the mark. The pound dropped 2.1% from about 2.98 marks to 2.9187 in little more than 24 hours. That move also caused the dollar to ease against the mark, traders said.    Traders questioned whether the pound's fall after reaching $1.60 last week signals the end of the &quot;stretch for yield&quot; of the past three weeks. Since Feb. 22, when the six largest non-communist industrialized nations agreed at a meeting in Paris that the dollar had fallen far enough, the U.S. currency has traded in a fairly narrow range against the mark and yen.    That has sent investors and speculators into higher-yielding currencies, especially those of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While rates paid on three-month Eurodeposits of dollars, marks and yen recently stood at 6.38%, 3.94% and 4.19%, respectively, the comparable rates on the British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand currencies were 9.88%, 6.89%, 16.4% and 25.7%.    Analysts noted that last week, while the pound climbed to a four-year high against the dollar, Canada's currency reached a more than two-year high, the Australian dollar was at a four-month peak, and the New Zealand dollar was at its highest in nearly a year against the U.S. currency.    But by Friday, each of those currencies had retreated from its week's high. In addition to the possible British central bank action, Australia's Reserve Bank was rumored to have sold large quantities of Australian dollars late Thursday in Far Eastern markets, lowering the currency to less than 67 1/2 U.S. cents from about 69 cents. Nicholas P. Sargen, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., said Canadian government data also &quot;reflect Bank of Canada activity to hold down the advance of the Canadian dollar.&quot;    &quot;The play of high-yield currencies may be temporarily over,&quot; Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. Mr. Sargen, however, remains unconvinced.    &quot;As long as there is a conviction that the dollar will be essentially stable, people are going to reach for yield,&quot; he said. Ms. Mills of Shearson Lehman said &quot;the focus could return to the pound&quot; if Britain's budget calls for reduced government borrowing and tax cuts.    Since the Feb. 22 meeting, fear and rumors of central bank intervention have kept the dollar between 1.82 and 1.87 marks and between 152 and 154 yen. With the market having failed to drive the U.S. currency higher last week, Mr. Soria and others say, it could try to nudge the dollar lower this week.    &quot;As long as the dollar remains below 152.80 yen (an important point on charts that traders use to try to predict currency movements), we have the potential to go to 150,&quot; he said. Mr. Soria also said the exchange rate between the yen and the mark rate hasn't changed since September 1985, when the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain agreed to a coordinated program to bring down the dollar's value.    &quot;The market perceives this as meaning that the yen should rise against the mark and other Continental currencies,&quot; he said. Mr. Soria said he expects the dollar to remain in a range of 145 to 155 yen and 1.77 to 1.87 marks in the near term.    Michael A. Gotthelf, a vice president at Berliner Handels andamp; Frankfurter Bank in New York, said growing apprehension about the effect of the Latin American debt crisis on U.S. banks could hurt the dollar. He noted Friday's warning by Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, that if commercial banks don't make additional loans to Latin American debtors, &quot;the consequence in the long run is that there are going to be defaults.&quot;    Traders also pointed to an announcement by Citicorp that it may be forced to place $3.9 billion of Brazilian loans on a nonaccrual basis, a step that could reduce earnings.    Nonetheless, Japanese dealers said trading related to the ending of Japan's fiscal year could help support the U.S. currency. Masakazu Miyamori, chief trader for Sanwa Bank in New York, predicted that Japan's life insurance companies will be big purchasers of dollar investments in the next 2 1/2 weeks.    He also said the Ministry of Finance requires Japanese corporations and life insurers to write off exchange losses on their dollar assets at the end of the fiscal year if the yen has risen more than 15% against the dollar during the year. The crucial point in that calculation, he said, is 153.65 yen.    Because of these as well as political pressures in Japan to reduce corporate losses, other traders said they expect any rises in the yen to be constrained by the Bank of Japan, at least until April.    &quot;I definitely think the market will ultimately test the central banks, but it will need more momentum&quot; than it has exhibited in recent weeks, Felix Fischer, a first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled Friday at $403.90 an ounce, down $4.80. Estimated volume was a hefty 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $404.80 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Friday, March 13, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
