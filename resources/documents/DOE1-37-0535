<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0535 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a comprehensive and practice-oriented way this book deals with thebasics of almost any type of industrial furnace ranging from fuel- toelectricity-operated ones; it also describes operation and burner construction.Over the last ten years and especially in the six years after the 4thedition was published a lot of new developments occurred not only onthe area of furnace and burner construction but also where electric resistanceheating and the use of new ceramic materials are concerned. The fifth,completely revised and enlarged edition also includes a new chapter on'Computer-aided construction of industrial furnaces'. Electronic dataprocessing has found its way into construction and operation of industrialfurnaces and this way is also traced in this book. Attention is restricted,however, to the technical field by giving an overview of the use of computers(Hardware) and the available software designed for the construction ofindustrial furnaces. A neutral analysis is made on when and how the useCAD and CAM is efficient and profitable. Some concrete examples of theuse of microprocessor systems for process control are given and explainedin a detailed and practice-oriented way. System applications are welldocumented and first successes are described in great detail.</TEXT></DOC>
