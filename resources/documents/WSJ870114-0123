They've never gotten the respect their performance in battles big and small should have earned them. The American Marines are lionized, thanks to their valor; thanks, too, to their public-relations skills.    Not so the Royal Marines. From the corps' beginning as the Admiral's Regiment in 1664, recruits have tended to be &quot;yokels,&quot; concedes retired marine Gen. J.L. Moulton, the corps' historian. The marines, &quot;though loyal and often endearing, were, alas, prone to little acts of thoughtless folly like sleeping or getting drunk on duty.&quot;    If setbacks have been commonplace over the years, the marines' biggest prize slipped away this week. Prince Edward, at 22 years of age the Queen's youngest -- and quietest -- son, who had been welcomed straight out of Cambridge University as a candidate for career officer, resigned.    For Edward, four months of arduous training at the marines' commando center were quite enough.    Almost surely, the Royal Marine Corps will survive. But losing their first &quot;royal&quot; is a setback for the &quot;booties&quot; -- the bootnecks, the British equivalent of the American &quot;leathernecks.&quot;    For the Royal Marines are the smallest and most vulnerable of all the British service branches. Twice since World War II, in 1948 and again in 1968, serious proposals were made to disband the corps. Both times, the marines managed to hang on. And wooing a member of the Royal Family away from its more traditional military outlets of navy and army was seen as an insurance policy -- one that has now been canceled.    The Royal Marines have fought bravely, and often obscurely, all over the world for more than 300 years. In 1982, they formed the nucleus of the British expeditionary force to the Falklands. Without the marines, Argentina might have won that nasty little war.    But bad luck seems to dog the Royal Marines. They were along in World War I on the disastrous raid on Zeebrugge; they were in the trenches at the disaster at Gallipoli. At the Battle of Jutland, the German shell that blew up the battle cruiser Lion landed on &quot;Q&quot; turret, the one manned by the marines. In World War II, marines who survived the sinking of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, two warships, surrendered in Singapore. Marines went along with the Canadians in the raid on Dieppe, even more disastrous than the one on Zeebrugge.    The force was formed as a group of soldiers who could serve aboard warships without getting seasick. The marines functioned as artillerymen and snipers, and when a warship closed with the enemy, they led the boarding parties. From the start, though, they got the short end of the stick. &quot;They were seen as part of the army,&quot; says retired marine Col. Keith Wilkins, director of the Royal Marines Museum here in Portsmouth. &quot;When the fighting ended and the army had to cut back, the first to go were the Marines.&quot;    They often fought ashore with army units. The &quot;shot heard 'round the world&quot; at Lexington, in 1775, supposedly was fired by marine Maj. John Pitcairn. He was killed at Bunker Hill, and the famous pistol that started it all was captured by the Americans. The museum here would like it back.    In 1814, Royal Marines helped to burn down the White House. It is said they spared the home of the American Marine commandant out of fraternal considerations. Years later, British and American marines fought side by side, first in Peking, defending the legations against the Boxers, next in Korea, participating in the epic march south from the Choisin Reservoir. The British unit, 41 Commando, received the American Presidential Unit Citation.    It is as commandos that the Royal Marines finally found a post-World War II role impressive enough to cut off the talk about disbandment. The marines' commando training at Lympstone may have played a part -- probably a small one -- in convincing Prince Edward to look for career options.    Marine commando training is tough. Britain's tabloid newspapers, reveling in the royal resignation, say the marine training is toughest of all, tougher than anything ever experienced by a &quot;royal&quot; before. But the &quot;paras&quot; -- the parachute regiment -- object, and the marines admit the parachute training is probably just as grim.    To win their green berets, marine recruits, both officers and enlisted men, must complete a six-mile endurance march, with full pack, in 80 minutes; &quot;yomp,&quot; or march, 30 miles across moorland in eight hours; and negotiate the dreaded &quot;Tarzan&quot; obstacle course.    By all accounts, Prince Edward was fit enough to win his beret. &quot;He was going very well in his training,&quot; said Col. Ian Moore, his commanding officer. Chances are the young prince may have found the corps lacking in intellectual stimulation.    Indeed, historian G.M. Trevelyan wrote in 1932 that it is remarkable how early on the marines &quot;acquired two reputations that clung to them for many generations -- a reputation for good, honest service and character, and a reputation among snobs of being socially less smart than the army.&quot;    The marines will keep on yomping along, but the prince will be missed.    &quot;I have a portfolio under lock and key of eight photographs of Prince Edward in commando training,&quot; says Capt. Robert Need, head of the corps' public-relations staff. &quot;Last week, a newspaper offered me 50,000 pounds ($74,000) for the lot.    &quot;Now, they're not worth anything.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
