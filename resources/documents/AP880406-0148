(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater today described as ``a throwaway remark'' a comment byPresident Reagan indicating approval of the notion of pardoningindicted former aide Oliver North.   Reagan did not say that he would pardon former White House aidesor others accused in the Iran-Contra affair. But, after hearing aproposal for pardons, he did say ``I like the sound of thosewords,'' said one congressman quoted in The Washington Post.   Another congressman quoted Reagan as saying, ``I like hearingwhat you said,'' after Rep. Henry J. Hyde suggested the presidentshould pardon North and former national security adviser John M.Poindexter at the end of Reagan's term.   Hyde, R-Ill., suggested the pardons be signed during ceremoniesat the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, according to thePost.   During a briefing for reporters at this seaside resort, not farfrom Reagan's ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, Fitzwater wasquestioned about the president's intentions.   ``I was there at that meeting, and Henry Hyde said he hoped thatNorth would be pardoned, and the president told him he is notdiscussing pardons at this time,'' the spokesman said.   ``And then there was some throwaway line, and I didn't give itany significance then or at this time,'' Fitzwater said. ``I don'tbelieve you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basisof a throwaway remark.''   Fitzwater said he could not remember Reagan's precise words, buthe did not dispute the quote attributed to Reagan.   ``I have raised the issue with the president four or five times,and every time he has said he wasn't discussing pardons,'' thespokesman said.   Hyde's proposal and Reagan's response reportedly were made March22 during the president's appearance before the House RepublicanConference, a closed meeting attended by 160 of the 177 GOP Housemembers.   The Post said the congressmen who quoted the president asked notto be identified since it was a closed session.   The Post quoted one congressman as saying he felt thepresident's message was unmistakable and ``If I had been Ollie andwitnessed that, I would have been pretty upbeat.''   The meeting occurred six days after North and Poindexter, alongwith arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim, pleadedinnocent to federal criminal charges in the sale of arms to Iranand the diversion of money to Contra rebels fighting the governmentof Nicaragua.   Three days later, Reagan predicted Poindexter and North would befound innocent ``because I don't think they were guilty of anylawbreaking or any crime.'' Speaking at a seminar sponsored by theCenter for the Study of the Presidency, Reagan called theIran-Contra affair ``the so-called scandal'' and said he stillconsidered North ``a hero.''   The president later said he was referring to North's combat inVietnam.   Fitzwater said a day after the indictments that there had beenno discussion of pardons. ``We don't discuss pardons. Period,''Fitzwater said.   Chief of staff Howard H. Baker later said Reagan would notconsider pardons until after North and Poindexter are tried.   Fitzwater said today he had not been aware of Baker's remarks.</TEXT></DOC>
