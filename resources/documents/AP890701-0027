Thornburgh overruled an immigration appeals board finding thatJoseph Patrick Thomas Doherty could reopen proceedings to seekpolitical asylum.   But Doherty cannot be deported immediately because of a pendinglegal challenge to a 1988 deportation order by then-Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III, said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel.   The challenge is pending before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in New York.   ``In my discretion, I would not grant the respondent asylum,''Thornburgh said. ``It is the policy of the United States that thosewho commit acts of violence against a democratic state shouldreceive prompt and lawful punishment.''   Deporting Doherty to the United Kingdom ``would unquestionablyadvance this important policy,'' Thornburgh wrote.   The State Department had previously determined that deportingDoherty ``is in the foreign policy interests of this country.''   The Doherty case has been the focus of political controversy,particularly among a group of House members from New York City whocontend he should be treated as political refugee.   Doherty's supporters were upset by Thornburgh's decision.   Rep. Eliot L. Engell, D-N.Y., said it was ``an outrage that fliesin the face of American justice.''   ``It's morally, legally and politically indefensible,'' saidPeter King, Republican comptroller of Nassau County in the suburbsof New York City. ``Thornburgh is allowing the Justice Departmentand the American legal system to be an accessory to MargaretThatcher's British government.''   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has also urged Thornburgh to grantDoherty's request for political asylum.   Doherty, 34, was convicted of killing a British Army captainduring a 1980 ambush of British troops in Ulster. He escaped from aprison in Belfast the next year and was arrested in New York City in1983. He has been held in federal custody since then.   Thornburgh overruled a Nov. 14 Board of Immigration Appeal rulingthat Doherty could reopen his request for political asylum.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportationproceedings in 1984 after a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., ruledDoherty could not be extradited because his crime was a politicalact that made him eligible for asylum.</TEXT></DOC>
