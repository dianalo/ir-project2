Department of DefenseData IntegritySystem IntegrityMilitaryCommunications Tapping.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DOD Data Linkups May Be Vulnerable to LeaksandM;Experts fear that the trend toward combining Defense Department computersystems and linking them to large databases through networks soon could causeserious security problems.andM;Systems that can reach quickly into distant databases and spew outinformation and analyses can improve productivity greatly, the experts said.andO;But the quantities of unclassified information in those databases areinviting targets for unauthorized users, they added.andM;Network security is a &quot;front-burner issue,&quot; said Michael McGrath, manager ofthe Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS) program, DOD'slargest data standardization effort.andM;An example of the problem is the Navy's Stock Point Logistics IntegratedCommunications Environment (SPLICE), which now connects about 35 depots andwarehouses.andP;  Using TXP mini-computers from Tandem Computers Inc., Cupertino,Calif., and the Defense Data Network (DDN), SPLICE links the automatedsystems of the Navy's main depots and warehouse with the Stock Point ADPReplacement System and the Inventory Control Point ADP systems.andM;SPLICE also reaches into many of the Navy's shipyards that eventually willhave computer-aided design systems.andM;For the Navy's warehouses, SPLICE, SPAR and ICP changed ADP from slow batchprocessing to distributed real-time data entry on the warehouse floor.andP;  Usersnow can use the SPLICE network to search through the Navy's warehouses for aneeded part and order it quickly.andM;In addition to increasing productivity, SPLICE also supported integration ofNavy computer systems, because it effectively standardized Navy logisticsmachines on the Tandem TXP.andM;The SPLICE hardware also hosts the Automation of Procurement and AccountingData Entry (APADE) system, which allows procurement officials to search forpotential vendors and prepares solicitation documents.andM;Navy plans call for the SPLICE network to be extended out to sea, allowing asupply officer to access the system through the ship's non-tactical ADPsystem.andM;Connecting With a SPLICEandM;The 108 facilities due to receive the Bases and Stations Information Systemalso will be integrated into SPLICE through the SPLICE-hosted UniformAutomated Data Processing System.andM;When the 43 Navy engineering drawing databases are connected to SPLICE, theywill allow APADE users quickly to retrieve drawings of spare parts, which canbe sent out to potential vendors interested in making production bids.andO;SPLICE already is connected to the Defense Logistics Agency's network.andM;ALthough the Navy's logistics network may be large, its reach will beextended greatly by the addition of the ADP systems using the CALS datastandards.andP;  The CALS program will standardize delivery and handling of allDOD technical information, from the original conception on an industryworkstation to actual use of the data by a submarine's maintenance crew 100fathoms under the sea.andM;When CALS is implemented fully, all the details of new systems procured byDOD will be stored on central databases, including design techniques andlogistic support requirements.andP;  The cost of handling and reproducing themillion pages of technical information needed for modern combat aircraft willbe reduced greatly, CALS officials said.andM;The CALS program initially is concentrating on standardized delivery oftechnical data and logistics support analysis records to automated DODdatabases.andM;Several of the most important DOD programs, including the next-generationsubmarine, vertical take-off aircraft and advanced attack helicopter, areusing CALS in their development activities.andP;  Distribution of information fromthe four central service databases to front-line maintenance and supportingpersonnel will take several years to implement, CALS specialists said.andM;When the CALS-based technical information databases are integrated with theservice logistics networks, supply and procurement personnel will be able torequest copies of technical drawings for maintenance or reordering spareparts, CALS official Bill Gorham said.andM;Integrated LogisticsandM;Because of the expense of image transmission, the drawings probably will bedelivered via overnight mail, Gorham said.andP;  Eventually they could betransmitted on communications lines when costs drop.andM;Because of its concentration on standards and on the DDN communicationslinks, CALS could integrate DOD's service logistics systems.andP;  Thus the NavyCALS systems will be linked together by a Navy logistics network, which willbe linked to the DDN-based SPLICE.andM;DDN will link the Army's $400 million CALS architecture of 56 sites, creatingconnections to the other service CALS systems.andP;  The Air Force isinvestigating a CALS-based Integrated Maintenance Information System, but itsCALS architecture still is at an early stage of development.andM;This huge collection of unclassified but sensitive data in the CALS andSPLICE databases presents a major threat to DOD information security,according to security expert Victor Hempel.andP;  Hempel, senior technical adviserto the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said that for example all thetechnical information relating to an advanced weapons system could be copiedin Moscow by computer experts hacking through the DDN network.andM;They could access DDN through the Vienna, Austria-based InternationalInstitute of Applied Systems Analysis TPA/70 gateway, which uses Tymnet tolink to the DDN.andM;This problem cannot be solved by distinquishing between classified andunclassified information, experts said.andP;  In practice, classified informationcan be extracted from unclassified databases.andM;Security ConcernsandM;For example, in World War II, Allied intelligence experts discovered thesecret Nazi rocket research facility at Peenemunde after noticing its highranking on a petroleum rationing coupon distribution list, Hempel said.andO;Similar intelligence information can be extracted from personnel databses,unless they are scrubbed vigorously, he said.andM;Because the CALS databases will include sensitive industrial and nationalsecurity data, hackers could gain access to large amounts of usefulinformation, several experts said.andM;McGrath said the CALS program officials &quot;must step up to the plate&quot; and dealwith the problem of access to unclassified data.andP;  The need to protect thedata in the CALS databases may be the catalyst for solving this problem,McGrath said.andM;Network monitoring may be one sulution, he said.andP;  The National Institute ofStandards and Technology and the National Security Agency already are helpingCALS program officials develop computer security, CALS officials said.andM;Hempel also said small changes in CALS-based technical data descriptionscould change the design of a particular item greatly, without changing itsexternal appearance.andP;  But CALS managers said the technical data would bestored at the central databases on unalterable optical disks.andM;If fully implemented, CALS standards could change DOD management procedures,McGrath said.andP;  For example, CALS will allow concurrent engineering, wheredesigners could work simultaneously on several stages of weapon systemdevelopment, using the CALS standards to ensure systems integration.andM;However, the tougher the security procedures that are installed to protectthe data, the harder it will be take advantage of the open communicationsallowed by networks and data standards, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
