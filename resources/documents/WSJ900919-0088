Usinga computer program to fill in the blanks, Ms. Brown can crankout a 100-page hard-cover novel in an hour. At last count,she had rewritten &quot;Paradise Dream&quot; 1,500 times.   Ms. Brown will cast a couple's names in the leading rolesfor $45. For another $15 she'll throw in their hobbies, bestfriends, favorite flowers, first kiss, pets, special songs,and other details. In one version, a guest sits on a glasstable during the wedding reception: &quot;The bride, groom andtheir guests spent the rest of the day pulling glass shardsfrom Jo's derriere.&quot;   Ms. Brown created Swan Publishing in 1987 out of a pair ofhobbies: computers and steamy novels. She enrolled in a&quot;Writing Romances&quot; course and six months later completed &quot;OurLove,&quot; a tale about a newspaper reporter and anallegedly-but-not-really-corrupt developer. Realizing thatthe romance-fiction market was impossibly crowded, shedecided to cut out the middlemen -- agent, publisher andsupermarket -- and sell customized books directly by mail.   From her garage in Placentia, Calif., Ms. Brown publishes&quot;Our Love,&quot; &quot;Paradise Dream&quot; and her latest, &quot;Lotto Love,&quot; inwhich a couple wins the lottery but then loses the winningticket. Customers can choose the sensuality level of theirtext -- from the Candlelit Edition (&quot;like the networkversion&quot;) to the Burning Embers Edition (&quot;the cableversion&quot;).   Pleased customers have come back for second and thirdorders, with a different paramour each time. &quot;I had a guytell me all about his girlfriend, and (how) he loved her andso on,&quot; Ms. Brown says. He later requested another novel --for his wife.</TEXT></DOC>
