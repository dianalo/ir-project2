That's when the owners start offering rent concessions and free gifts like appliances to attract tenants.    With vacancy rates nationally in the 7% to 8% range -- the highest the apartment business has seen in 15 years, according to industry executives -- the rent deals and the gifts are now plentiful. But some big apartment developers and owners are taking other approaches to filling their buildings. They're providing more amenities and going after different types of tenants, such as companies that want an alternative to hotels for housing employees for short periods.    Cardinal Industries Inc., for example, plans to announce this week a program designed for the short-term corporate resident. The Columbus, Ohio, builder is offering studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom suites with hotel-like amenities such as maid service at its 52,000 apartments nationwide.    AT AN AVERAGE COST of $35 a day for an apartment, Cardinal says it's cheaper for companies to rent its apartments than hotel rooms, which Cardinal estimates cost an average of $70 a day for the same package. Cardinal tested the idea earlier this year in Orlando, Fla., and Columbus; the average corporate stay, it says, was two to three months.    Cardinal isn't the first apartment owner to go after corporate tenants in a big way. Los Angeles-based Randamp;B Enterprises, through its Randamp;B Apartment Management Co. unit, started catering to the short-term corporate tenant in 1980. Today, the company estimates nearly 50% of its new tenants are corporate renters.    Some apartment owners are attempting to keep vacancy rates down by concentrating on retaining their existing tenants while also trying to attract new ones. Two months ago, Oxford Development Co., a Bethesda, Md., developer, unveiled Oxford Club, a program that raises the level of services provided residents who live in Oxford's 63,000 apartments. Oxford provides discounts on cruises, will arrange financing for autos, and will even deliver mail to vacationing tenants if they're in a city where there's another Oxford property. In addition, tenants who move to another Oxford Development community don't have to pay a security deposit, which can mean an outlay of between $300 and $900.    Oxford Development says it will spend between $290,000 to $435,000, or $1,000 to $1,500 an apartment complex, to put its Oxford Club program into effect at all of its 290 communities. But it's a necessary expense to keep competitive. &quot;Let's face it,&quot; says John M. Kurtz, senior vice president, &quot;vacancies at apartments are at a current high . . . and they're increasing.&quot;    ---   Some Low Opinions of Building Tops    The skyline has always been the canvas for architects, for better or worse. Now, some architects and design critics believe, it may be for the worse. Long criticized for producing legions of box-shaped, glass-sheathed office towers, architects have turned to detail with zeal. And some think it may be going too far, particularly when it comes to building tops.    Many of the new buildings are tapered and adorned with neon lighting. Some have domes; others have angled tops reminiscent of New York City's Citicorp Building. Some have pyramid-shaped tops, like Portland, Ore.'s KOIN Center; others have sought to be more creative, such as the Texas Commerce Tower in Dallas, with the hole in its crown.    &quot;There's certainly been a lot of competition to see how attention-attracting the tops of buildings can be,&quot; says George Lewis, an architect and the former executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. &quot;It's as if a lot of these buildings are shouting at each other, 'I'm better designed than you are.' As a result, they don't come off convincingly,&quot; he says.    Although the profession and design critics welcome the return to detail in buildings, they say the plethora of unusual building tops has created an unhappy hodgepodge in many cities. The consternation over this development stems from the fact that while many buildings are private endeavors, many architects believe enjoyment of a skyline is an inherent urban right. Observes Sam Hall Kaplan, design critic for the Los Angeles Times: &quot;We're seeing a lot of interesting buildings, but they don't work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
