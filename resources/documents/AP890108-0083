Tizard, expressing concern about ``unctuous statements'' fromaround the world following the emperor's death from cancer onSaturday, argued that Hirohito ``should have been shot or publiclychopped up at the end of the war.   ``For New Zealand to express any sympathy grates against my backteeth,'' said Tizard, who served in New Zealand's air force duringthe war.   Prime Minister David Lange issued a statement later, sayingTizard was expressing personal views not endorsed by the Laborgovernment.   Tizard, a former deputy prime minister and the Labor'sgovernment's longest serving member of Parliament, told reporters heblamed Hirohito for the deaths of ``a few hundred of my friends andthousands of others who were butchered by the Japanese after beingtaken prisoner.''   He said he was ``grateful'' for the dropping of atomic bombs onJapan by the United States, adding he did not think his commentswould affect New Zealand's trading relationship with Japan.   ``They trade with us only when and if they can't get a betterdeal from anyone else,'' he said.   Japan is New Zealand's largest overseas market and exports tothat country last year totaled $1.7 billion.   Tizard claimed not to hold any grudges against the Japanesepeople.   ``I don't think the sins of the father should be visited on theson,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
