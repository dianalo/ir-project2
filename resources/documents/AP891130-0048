The organization representing 1,400 municipalities wrapped upits five-day convention Wednesday by also asking the federalgovernment for more help in dealing with AIDS, adopting a policysupporting a ban on automatic assault-type weapons and calling forU.S. sanctions against South Africa.   Fort Worth, Texas, Mayor Bob Bolen was elected president of theorganization for 1990.   ``Congress continues to enact anti-drug legislation withoutproviding significant resources to our cities, the level ofgovernment that deals most directly with our young people,'' said aresolution passed by league delegates.   The resolution asked for $3 billion for local anti-drug efforts.   The chief components of the increased federal funding should betreatment and education programs for young people, the resolutionsaid.   In a policy statement, the league said anti-drug efforts shouldinclude programs aimed at reducing abuse of ``legal drugs,'' suchas alcohol and cigarettes.   In other business, the league called on cities to adoptanti-discrimination measures regarding people with acquired immunedeficiency syndrome, but said local officials can give littleconcrete help to AIDS victims unless the government provides morefinancial support.   ``Unless the federal government plays a major financial role inthe national public health emergency of AIDS, the state and localgovernments' hands are tied,'' the organization said.   The league also urged a ban on the manufacture, sale andimportation of all automatic and semi-automatic assault-typeweapons, except for the military and police.   The league further called for a 30-day waiting period for thepurchase or transfer of all guns.   Previous league policy supported only a ban on the sale orcriminal use of armor-piercing handgun bullets. A motion to amendleague policy to support registration of all guns failed.   On South Africa, the organization approved a resolutioncriticizing the U.S. policy of ``constructive engagement'' towardapartheid. The resolution backed federal sanctions against SouthAfrica's government and urged cities to withdraw funds and ceaseinvestment in that nation.</TEXT></DOC>
