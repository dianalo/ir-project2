The obtained expressionpermits to calculate S matrix if behaviour of two-time Green functionson time infinities is known. To simplify the presentation authors consideronly one-dimensional quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator. All formulasderived in this model are simply extended to the field theory, though,for existence of S matrix the introduction of interaction factor is necessary.2 refs.; 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
