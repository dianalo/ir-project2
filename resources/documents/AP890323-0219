(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Retirement's tranquility, seen by many as areward after the responsibilities of child-rearing, is coming to ajarring end for a growing number whose children want to move back in_ and have AIDS.   ``Some parents find out for the first time their child is gay andat the same time he also has AIDS. This is a real blow,'' said one56-year-old woman whose son was diagnosed two years ago with AIDS.She asked that her name not be used because her son doesn't want hisidentity known. ``Parents always think they should die first, beforetheir children.''   ``And AIDS can split families,'' she added. ``Some members of thefamily accept, others reject him. That makes it worse for everybody.And you lose friends. Some churches even reject you.''   In addition, said Roger Lane of the Health Crisis Network inMiami, the $50,000 to $120,000 costs of care for AIDS patients ``putan extra burden on the parents, particularly if they are elderly andhave limited finances.''   Increasingly, social workers and AIDS help network officials say,AIDS victims are coming to Florida. Some come from the North becausewarm weather helps protect them from the pneumonia and flu they aresusceptible to, others come from small states for better health care_ and others have parents here.   ``My parents have been great,'' said a 41-year-old AIDS patientwho moved from Colorado to Palm Beach County five months ago. ``Theclinic (in Palm Beach County) is really pretty good. Certainly, theweather is great.''   State officials have no firm data on AIDS migrants, but someclinics estimate that 10 percent to 15 percent of AIDS patients cameto Florida after being diagnosed. The number of reported cases,which officials said would not include some victims diagnosedelsewhere, has tripled since January 1987 to 6,856, putting Floridathird behind New York and California.   ``We don't turn patients away,'' said Jim Cobb, administrator ofthe state AIDS clinic in Palm Beach County. ``But we can't be thefront doorstep for the country. We don't want to resemble the Statueof Liberty.''   As education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome hasimproved, and when relatives accept that the deadly virus isn'tcontracted by casual contact, instances of family rejection aredecreasing, Lane said. ``Think about being at the terminal stage ofyour life and you have been rejected by the ones you feel close to,and you feel isolated from your relatives.''   ``The scariest thing for a young person is to be alone,'' saidMary Meeker, who through Catholic Church volunteer activities nowworks with the Pasco AIDS Support Community and cares for two AIDSvictims as a volunteer.   ``I found that gays are the first ones to turn and run when theyfind out you have AIDS,'' said a 26-year-old Hudson man who wasdiagnosed in October and asked not to be identified to protect hislover. ``But my family has been very supportive. I'm glad they'rethere.''   In small towns like Hudson, 30 miles north of Tampa on the GulfCoast, news that someone is infected with AIDS spreads quickly andreaction can be quick.   The Hernando-Pasco Hospice, dedicated to helping terminalpatients die with loving care at home, in October 1987 started aPasco support group.   Participants have painful memories: a son whose parents changedthe locks; a youth whose brother-in-law told him to hurry up and dieso he wouldn't burden the family; a woman whose boss made her gettested after he learned her son had AIDS, then transferred her froma cafeteria job despite a negative test result.   The group has grown from four to at least 36 members and spawnedtwo other groups in Pasco County, where 44 percent of the 260,000residents are over 55.   ``We have so many elderly people here, so many parents in oneplace, that we're seeing AIDS patients from other cities coming hereto die with their parents,'' said Peter Pavich, a support groupmember who has been diagnosed with human immune deficiency virus,HIV, which causes AIDS.   Pavich said the group has helped him understand rejection by hisfamily. ``It's really unfair. It's supposed to be their goldenyears, and everything's going great and then they're hit with thisbrick wall and everything changes.''   The hospice helped the 26-year-old Hudson man, who feared hewould die in a hospital in October as pneumonia worsened, his weightdropped to 95 pounds, and doctors refused to release him unless hecould supply his oxygen, medicine and other needs. He's now up to145 pounds and talks with determined optimism.   ``I try not to think about it. I know eventually it's going tohappen, but I live day to day and try to make every day the bestpossible,'' he said.   In this county, which is typical of rural counties beingdiscovered by developers, a relatively small influx of AIDS victimsquickly strains services.   ``There are so many things we need in this area. We need food,medical attention, outpatient care, dental treatment,'' said EvaSylvester, a hospice services coordinator who recently called sevendentists before finding one who would care for an AIDS patient. ``Weget frustrated; we get angry. What we need is more information andmore education.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs March 29</NOTE></DOC>
