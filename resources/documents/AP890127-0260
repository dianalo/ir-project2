After a day-long meeting Thursday in London, the participantssaid they agreed to share responsiblity for ensuring marketstability and that the non-OPEC countries supported OPEC's targetprice of $18 a barrel.   But no specific actions, such as production cuts, were announced.   Oil prices fell immediately on the news, but then recoveredsomewhat on Friday.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, stood at $16.27 a barrel Friday afternoon,up 2 cents from late Thursday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ was up 9cents in early trading today after falling 40 cents on Thursday tosettle at $17.72 a barrel.   ``It was a satisfactory first step, but we must keep the momentumgoing,'' Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'Secretary-General Subroto said in an interview. ``The atmosphere atthe meeting was very, very encouraging.''   The non-OPEC producers told the OPEC members that they had agreedon a set of actions but that they wished to advise their ownministers before revealing them to OPEC, said Subroto, who chairedthe meeting of experts.   High-level OPEC sources said the non-OPEC group mentioned theidea of a ceiling on their combined output.   The non-OPEC producers didn't ask for anything from OPEC inreturn, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Cutting production by 5 percent ``is an option,'' Subroto said,without elaborating.   Non-OPEC sources had said this week that independent producersmight offer to cut their production unilaterally by that amount.   This was the second joint meeting of the two sides. The closedgathering also was attended by observers from an additional sixindependent oil producers.   When they met for the first time in April, non-OPEC producerssuggested the two sides jointly cut production by 5 percent. OPECrefused, however.   OPEC members have expressed resentment that they curb their ownproduction to boost oil prices, from which the independentcountries, producing what they like, benefit unfairly.   ``At the moment, it looks like it's nothing concrete so it's notthe most bullish outcome one could have expected,'' said PhilipMorgan, an oil analyst with the London investment firm CiticorpScrimgeour Vickers. ``Even so, I think it's a positive step and ifcuts are going to be forthcoming in the second quarter, then thisshould protect prices from sliding.''   But Paul McDonald, a London-based independent oil analyst, said,``Yea, but what have they done? They've just said they're in favorof higher oil prices.''   He described the outcome as ``OPEC and non-OPEC hot air'' whichhe said was designed to manipulate the oil market into taking priceshigher.   The two sides issued a joint communique which said: ``Theindependent oil producers supported the OPEC objective of reaching aprice of $18 a barrel ... as soon as possible and both sides agreedon the joint responsibility to ensure market stability ....''   ``They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhanceimprovements already achieved and to further strengthen the oilmarket, especially in the second quarter of 1989.'   The communique added that ``the independent producers agreed torecommend to their appropriate authorities the necessary cooperativemeasures to contribute to market stability in the coming months.''   The statement didn't specify any measures.   Oil ministers from both sides are expected to hold a meetingtogether at a yet-to-be decided date, Subroto said.   The particpating OPEC members were Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.   The 13-member cartel's other members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya,Qatar, Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.   The non-OPEC group consisted of representatives of Angola, China,Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman and observers from theSoviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic and the Canadianprovince of Alberta and the U.S. states of Alaska and Texas.   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted $18a barrel. The agreement was effective Jan. 1.   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels aday, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourthquarter. That has helped oil prices recover from around $12 a barrelin December.</TEXT></DOC>
