Hyde Park, a New York-based investment firm, also said that it obtained sufficient financing, and that it extended its tender offer to Feb. 12 from Wednesday.    Officials of High Voltage, a Burlington, Mass.-based maker of instruments and electrical parts, didn't return several phone calls seeking comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, High Voltage jumped $1.125 to close at $16.50.    Hyde Park also said that it obtained a commitment for $5 million from Berisford Capital Corp., giving it sufficient funds to buy all High Voltage shares.    High Voltage, which has been fighting to remain independent, has raised questions about the adequacy of Hyde Park's financing, and has been seeking other bidders. It has said it received &quot;preliminary indications of interest from a number of third parties,&quot; but hasn't identified them.    Hyde Park complained that it hasn't been given the same information that other potential bidders are getting, but said that &quot;the board has failed to elicit even a single competing bid . . . . We anticipate an enthusiastic endorsement of our offer from the true owners of the company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
