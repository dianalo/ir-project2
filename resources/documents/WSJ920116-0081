They are pushing to form or strengthenpolitical action committees in order to enhancesmall-business power.   Some have clearly caught the spirit. &quot;This is the electionof the century,&quot; asserts Stephen Driesler, senior vicepresident of government affairs at the National Associationof Realtors. He and other lobbyists cite a confluence offactors he expects to produce a rare opportunity to influencethe outcome of an unusually large number of congressionalraces: an expected surge in retirements, growingdissatisfaction with incumbents, and the effects ofredistricting. Also, this is a presidential election year,which typically brings out more voters, coming in the wake ofa long and deep economic slump. A confluence of such factors,Mr. Driesler believes, won't be repeated for decades.</LP><TEXT>   The Realtor group's federal PAC, a major campaigncontributor, aims to raise $5.2 million from its 750,000Realtor members in the 1991-92 election fund-raising cycle,up more than 8% from the previous two-year cycle when theeconomy was in better shape.   Today, discontent over the economy is encouraging an&quot;anti-incumbency wave&quot; among the electorate, contends TomSponsler, who heads a program at the Business-IndustryPolitical Action Committee that helps businesses supportstate legislative candidates. &quot;Small businesses are aware forthe first time of the need to get involved in the process,&quot;he asserts.   One piece of legislation that has heightenedsmall-business people's resolve to get more activepolitically is the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990,which will force even the tiniest businesses to makepotentially costly alterations to accommodate disabledcustomers.   Indeed, more small businesses are getting involved informing PACs. Suresh Arurkar, owner of an import-exportbusiness, is preparing to start a state PAC this year for theMaryland chapter of the American Small BusinessesAssociation, based in Grapevine, Texas. The group's membersplan to back candidates who will support small-businessfinancing assistance, cuts in business-property taxes, andrevival of a program that gives employers a tax credit forhiring locals.   Other groups are bolstering existing efforts. The NationalAssociation of Convenience Stores has doubled its PAC boardto eight members to step up fund-raising. One of its goals isto back legislation to prevent refiners from chargingconvenience stores that sell gasoline more than the refinerscharge their own adjacent outlets.   The National Federation of Independent Business aims toadd 1,000 members to its PAC, raising the total to about8,000. It also hopes to boost members' average donations byencouraging members to call their fellow members.   This week, the federation is kicking off a mailing to3,000 loyal PAC donors. It will follow up with mailings toother members, once it decides which candidates it willendorse this year. As in recent years, the nation's largesttrade group that represents only small businesses will targetincumbents it views as anti-small business.   The group plans to concentrate its efforts: it says itsnational PAC will actively assist fewer than 20 congressionalcandidates. That's all its staff can handle, says Lisa Scott,manager of the group's PAC.   In the slow economy, small-business PACs are working toexpand their base by scaring up more small donors. That's theaim of the National Association of Homebuilders. Tom Baker,who runs the association's PAC, says his organization raisedits direct-mail budget by 20% to increase its mailings tomembers and has begun holding golf tournaments for smalldonors. This is to reduce its reliance on a few big donors.As a result, the association increased the number of donorsin 1991 by 58% to 5,027 -- and raised $800,000 toward itstwo-year goal of $1.8 million.   As competition for contributions intensifies in the sloweconomy, small-business groups are fine-tuning theirfund-raising strategies. Boston restaurateur Thomas A.Kershaw, who heads the National Restaurant Association's PAC,says he will ask the group's board members to write personalsolicitations to fellow restaurateurs in their variousstates. &quot;We are going to personalize the request, rather thanmailing a bland request for money from the Washingtonoffice,&quot; he says.   Other groups are seizing this year's elections as a chanceto revive their PACs. &quot;In the 1982 election cycle, we madeover $100,000 in contributions and we have not met that goalsince then,&quot; says Teri Richman, PAC treasurer for theNational Association of Convenience Stores, in Alexandria,Va. Among other factors, she says, people feel so manyincumbents get reelected, trying to unseat them is useless.   Last year, however, the association moved to rebuild itsPAC by establishing clubs for both big and small donors.Members of the 365 Club, who give $1 a day, get lapel pinsand recognition. Capitol Club members, who give $1,000 ormore, get perks such as lunch with lawmakers.   Still, fund-raising for small-business groups won't beeasy this year. The slow economy will keep financiallystressed businesses from giving as much as they might inhealthier times. And, small-business political advisers say,many small businesses avoid PACs in general now, shunningtheir reputation for representing special interests andprotecting incumbents.   &quot;Fund-raising is very tough {now},&quot; says the federation'sMs. Scott. But Ms. Scott aims to raise about $800,000 for thecurrent 1991-92 federal election cycle, up $50,000 from theprior 1989-90 period. &quot;If we can increase it a little bit,&quot;she says, &quot;I consider that a success.&quot;   Some groups are stressing approaches other than relianceon PACs. Two years ago, the National Grocers Associationstopped soliciting contributions to its PAC and maintains itat only a minimal level. Instead, the group encourages its2,000 members to donate individually to local politicalcandidates. And it raises money -- $125,000 targeted thisyear -- to fund a political education committee.   Other groups, too, aren't limiting their efforts tofund-raising. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it will pushto boost voter turnout among business owners, large andsmall. Daniel Kush, director of public affairs, says, &quot;Youcan have all the PACs in the world, but if people don't turnout to vote, what good are they?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
