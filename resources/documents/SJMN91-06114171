A class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Apple shareholders in1984 went to trial Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in San Jose beforeJudge James Ware.;    The lawsuit, which charged that the Cupertino-basedcompany and its directors engaged in securities fraud, initially asked for$120 million in damages. The shareholders claimed Apple officials mademisleading statements about the sales prospects for the company's ill-fatedLisa computer and a disk drive with the code name &quot;Twiggy,&quot; intended for usewith the Lisa. The innovative but over-priced Lisa computer sold poorly, andthe Twiggy drive, plagued by technical problems, never reached the market.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  1983 STOCK DROP FINALLY LANDS APPLE IN COURT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Apple stock, which fell from more than $31 to less than $9 in 1983, did notrecover for three years, until the company's Macintosh computers had beenintroduced and won a significant following.;    In 1987, a federal judgedismissed the class-action suit without a trial, finding no evidence ofsecurities law violations. In September 1989, a federal appeals court in SanFrancisco affirmed the dismissal of all but two of the original 32 shareholderclaims.;    The appeals court ruled that Apple's directors didn'tintentionally mislead investors about the outlook for Lisa because theyreasonably thought the prospects for success were good.;    The U.S. SupremeCourt upheld the ruling of the appeals court in June by refusing to hear thecase.;    The jury trial will focus on whether Apple officials paid enoughattention to Twiggy's technical problems before offering their optimisticassessment of Lisa's prospects. They also will consider whether Apple officersshould have disclosed Twiggy's problems.;    Many high-tech companies inSilicon Valley have been sued by shareholders after financial reversals pushedstock prices downward. Most firms have settled such suits to avoid the expenseof protracted litigation. Apple, however, has chosen to fight class-actionsecurities suits.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RON WOLF, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910423  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  333  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 23, 199100114171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
