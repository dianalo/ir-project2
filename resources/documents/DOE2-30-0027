As to the data-processing for on-line failure detection, themoving average (MA), least squares, and adaptive digital filter methodswere experimentally applied. The following results were obtained: Thesensitivity of failure detection by the constant trace, least squaresmethod and the adaptive digital filter method is high, so that the detectionis possible even if the parameters are varied repeatedly. Though it issupposed that it depends on the object of failure detection which signalprocessing technique is the most appropriate, in this experiment, theconstant trace least squares method which utilizes a current signal asan input and a detecting signal as an output gives the best results.(11 figs, 15 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
