Gephardt, whose campaign faltered after his initial win inIowa's caucuses on Feb. 8, said he would file for re-election tohis House seat from Missouri.   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challengedthe Democratic Party and called it back to its central role as anagent of fundamental change,'' Gephardt said at an emotionalCapitol Hill news conference packed with journalists andsupporters, including many of his House colleagues.   Gephardt had appealed to workers, farmers and the downtroddenwith his theme of ``it's your fight, too.'' He said his drive hadbrought other candidates closer to his positions on trade and farmpolicy and would result in a nominee committed to fight foreconomic justice.   ``That was our message and that is our victory. Now that messagebelongs to all the Democratic Party. I am convinced that it is ...the only way for us to win in 1988 and beyond,'' Gephardt said ashis wife clasped her hands and fought back tears.   The Missouri congressman, also accompanied by his threechildren, quipped, ``I haven't seen a crowd this large in a long,long time,'' after entering the ornate caucus room and giving athumbs-up sign to his supporters.   Gephardt predicted a Democratic nominee would be chosen fromamong those now running but refused to throw his support to anyone.He said he might make an endorsement at a later time.   Gephardt's withdrawal left Jesse Jackson just ahead of Dukakisin the AP delegate count.   Most of Gephardt's delegates were shifted into the uncommittedcategory with his withdrawal. But Missouri party rules mandate thatthe at-large and public official delegates are redivided among theactive candidates when a contender drops out. That gave Jackson atleast six more delegates.   Jackson now has 606.55, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis605.55, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 168.5and uncommitted 515.6, according to the AP count.   Asked to comment on Jackson's candidacy, Gephardt replied, ``Ibelieve Jesse Jackson can be nominated and I think he can beelected.'' He turned down a chance to give advice to the party'sother front-runner, Dukakis, with whom he had engaged in sharpexchanges of negative TV ads.   ``Michael Dukakis has sure done a lot better than I did,''Gephardt said. ``I don't think it's my place to tell him what todo.''   Gephardt attributed his failed candidacy to a lack of money andsaid that when he was able to get his ideas across, ``we didconnect.'' But he added, ``I have no alibis. We lost, no questionabout that.''   Gephardt's wins in Iowa, South Dakota and his home state wereburied by disappointing showings in more than two dozen otherstates _ including Michigan, where he had said he needed a``Michigan miracle'' last Saturday to revive his campaign.   With his tough trade stance, the six-term congressman might havebeen expected to do well in a state heavy with unions andautomakers. But he failed to win labor backing and finished adistant third in the Michigan caucuses, behind Jackson and Dukakis.   Gephardt, a consensus builder in the House, found a niche in thepresidential race as an anti-establishment populist. He had awell-honed message and an aggressive television campaign.   But Gephardt, 47, was hampered by a chronic shortage of cash andby continuing skepticism about his populist challenge to ``theapostles of the status quo.''   As chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Gephardt was hardlya stranger to the establishment he so bitterly attacked during hiscampaign. He was also vulnerable because of switches over the yearson issues ranging from abortion to Reaganomics.   The well-heeled Dukakis ran pointed television ads, one showinga man flip-flopping through the air and the other a list ofGephardt's corporate contributors. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee not only attacked Gephardt on his changes of heart, butadopted his same populist theme.   After Michigan, Gephardt had only 167 delegates _ less thanone-third the totals amassed by Dukakis and Jackson and fewer thaneven Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who didn't compete on SuperTuesday.   Last year, Gephardt's poll showings in Iowa had been in thesingle digits until after Christmas, when he began running TV ads.Among them was his famous ``Hyundai'' spot alleging that a $10,000Chrysler K-car would cost $48,000 in Korea because of trade tariffs.   Trade experts challenged the accuracy of the ad, but that didn'tdilute its impact in Iowa. The TV drive, combined with thegrass-roots network Gephardt had doggedly built over two years,propelled him to victory in the Feb. 8 caucuses.   Later that month, Gephardt won the South Dakota primary largelyon the strength of an ad charging that Dukakis was ``one of thebiggest tax-raisers in Massachusetts history and saying Dukakis'idea of helping farmers was telling them to grow Belgian endive.   Gephardt formally declared his candidacy on Feb. 23, 1987, buthe had begun campaigning more than a year earlier. His lastcampaign speech was in Milwaukee, before Wisconsin Democrats whoseprimary is Tuesday. ``All things considered,'' he told them, ``I'drather be back in Des Moines.''</TEXT></DOC>
