Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican and fervent Bush supporter, had a simple analysis: &quot;Bush won.&quot;    Both the Dukakis memorandum and Rep. Leach's assessment were given before the presidential candidates stepped onto the stage at Wake Forest University last night to hold their first debate.    This is the work of the &quot;spin patrols&quot; -- the phalanxes of Bush and Dukakis supporters whose overriding goal last night was to try to convince the assembled media representatives, and ultimately the American people, that their man won.    The stilted format of the debate, which ruled out any direct questioning of one candidate by the other and prevented freewheeling exchanges, all but assured a less than conclusive outcome, and thus gave both sides a chance to claim victory.    Each candidate recruited a stellar cast of politicians to sell his side of the story. Among many others, the Democrats had Sen. John Glenn of Ohio and Rep. Tony Coelho of California. The Republicans had Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire and Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming.    Immediately after the debate, the already-packed cafeteria that served as a news room at Wake Forest University was instantly transformed into a mobile briefing room. Reporters and hand-held cameras trailed political luminaries as they spun their way through carefully scripted commentaries that inevitably concluded that their candidate stole the show. The cafeteria soon resembled a Washington cocktail party much more than it did a working media center.    Each side had a clear strategy. The Bush campaign emphasized the vice president's conservative stands on such issues as the death penalty and tax increases. The Dukakis camp was eager to portray Mr. Bush as defensive and somewhat erratic: Several Dukakis aides dropped the word &quot;rambling&quot; into their commentaries.    The spin squads prepared for the debate just as the candidates themselves did. The Democrats got a briefing about the themes that Gov. Dukakis was expected to invoke. They argued that he was the candidate of issues rather than slogans, that he had a better grasp of what the &quot;people wanted,&quot; and that he was more than just a governor and was able to lead a nation. And when the debate concluded, that's precisely what they told reporter after reporter.    In the end there were too many spinners. One low-level Bush aide dragged a senior Bush staffer across the floor. &quot;Elizabeth Dole is standing over there,&quot; the young aide said, &quot;and nobody is talking to her.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
