In recent weeks Mr. Bush has addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, visited an ammunition plant, toured a defense-electronics factory, traveled to a naval yard and stopped by a fort.    As this march through military symbolism suggests, Mr. Bush aims to turn the presidential election into a national referendum on defense policy -- and he is having some success. He persistently attacks his Democratic rival, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, as a naive disarmer whose plans to cut big nuclear-weapons projects would cost the U.S. leverage in arms negotiations and leave it with an unreliable defense. Mr. Dukakis, the vice president says derisively, seems to have opposed &quot;every new weapons system since the slingshot.&quot;    Yesterday Mr. Bush stepped up his attack. He charged that Mr. Dukakis &quot;has veered outside of the bipartisan mainstream&quot; on security issues and demanded that the governor state his positions on key issues ranging from the U.S. attack on Libya to the idea of a nuclear freeze. Worried by these assaults, Mr. Dukakis has scheduled a major speech on defense for tomorrow and says he plans to restate his positions &quot;forcefully.&quot;    This year, voters have a choice between distinct defense programs, but the differences are more complex than the rhetoric suggests. In deficit-plagued 1988, the debate doesn't turn on who would have a bigger defense budget; Mr. Bush might spend a little more, Mr. Dukakis a little less. The real debate is over what to spend money on. Mr. Bush suggests he would devote available dollars first to strategic nuclear programs, both offensive and defensive, while Mr. Dukakis would devote them to nonnuclear, conventional programs.    While critics charge that Mr. Dukakis never met a weapons system he liked, the question for Mr. Bush is whether he ever met any he didn't like. So far, he has avoided identifying any programs he is willing to sacrifice, even though Pentagon officials concede there isn't enough money to pay for everything the Reagan administration has put in the pipeline.    &quot;Mr. Bush can't do all of the things he says he wants to do and maintain strong conventional defenses at the same time,&quot; Mr. Dukakis says in an interview. Some defense analysts worry that Mr. Bush's endorsement of all Reagan big-ticket weapons could invite a return of the &quot;hollow army&quot; -- armed forces starved of more mundane items like fuel and ammunition -- that Mr. Bush and President Reagan campaigned against in 1980.    &quot;There's no way&quot; to fund all these existing weapons programs without &quot;shorting troop units&quot; in the field, worries retired Gen. Edward Meyer, formerly the Army chief of staff. &quot;The Army would take the brunt of it,&quot; he predicts.    So far, though, the defense debate centers on Mr. Dukakis's proposals for a radical shift away from Reagan administration defense priorities. He would broadly scale back spending on strategic nuclear forces by canceling both new land-based nuclear missiles under development -- the Midgetman missile and a version of the MX based on railroad cars -- and by shrinking the 'Star Wars' Strategic Defense Initiative to a $1 billion-a-year research program. Savings from those programs would go to improve conventional defenses, which he argues will become far more important if the U.S. wraps up a proposed treaty with the Soviets cutting strategic nuclear arsenals by half.    His approach raises two serious questions, though. Would it leave the U.S. with a nuclear force that would be modern and durable enough if the treaty cut nuclear arsenals in half? And is Mr. Dukakis really prepared to pay for big improvements in conventional arms, which can be as costly as big nuclear programs?    Beyond that, Mr. Dukakis must convince skeptics that he isn't simply anti-defense or anti-nuclear. Even some Democratic defense specialists came away from an October 1987 meeting with Mr. Dukakis suspecting he had an abiding distaste for all nuclear weapons. The governor's refusal to accept repeated invitations to visit the sprawling Hanscomb Air Force Base just a short drive from his Boston office has only exacerbated fears that he doesn't have much interest in defense matters.    &quot;The problem is that Dukakis doesn't know enough about defense to know how important it is,&quot; charges Anthony Cordesman, a former Pentagon analyst who now is an aide to GOP Senator John McCain of Arizona. Mr. Dukakis has begun trying to toughen his defense image by stressing nuclear weapons he wants to continue developing -- the D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missile and the Stealth bomber -- and by pledging to consider ways other than the MX and Midgetman to strengthen the land-based nuclear missile force.    Yesterday, the vice president pressed Mr. Dukakis to state his position on whether he supported the invasion of Grenada, backed the raid on Libya, believes SDI testing is necessary, supports deployment of the D-5 and Stealth, believes full 15 carrier task forces are essential, renounces his onetime support of a nuclear freeze and will let Massachusetts participate in a new military communications network. If Mr. Dukakis can't answer in the affirmative to all those questions, Mr. Bush said, he either is out of the &quot;mainstream&quot; or has &quot;flip-flopped.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Bush says he wants to continue working on all the big strategic programs the Reagan administration has started until after a strategic-arms deal is wrapped up with the Soviets. &quot;I support our defense budget,&quot; he says in an interview. &quot;I would like to leave the budget the way it is until we probe further on the strategic-arms agreement.&quot; Aides insist he would succeed in squeezing more weapons into the flat defense budget by making Pentagon buying more efficient.    Still, Mr. Bush acknowledges that the U.S. ultimately can't afford to deploy fully both the single-warhead Midgetman and a new MX missile. He simply argues the U.S. should keep developing for now to maintain &quot;options.&quot;    Mr. Bush appears to be promising an all-out research program leading to deployment of some kind of missile-defense program as soon as technology is clearly proven feasible, yet his rhetoric about the Strategic Defense Initiative waffles between unbridled enthusiasm and cautious interest.    He denies a New Yorker magazine report that he told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he has a &quot;more pragmatic&quot; stance on SDI than President Reagan. But his actual position is unclear. Last month, he told the New York Times, &quot;If you want a full deployment of a full strategic defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is continue to research at the levels of funding essentially that we have requested.&quot; Later, he told American Legion members, &quot;We cannot leave America hostage to Soviet ballistic missiles.&quot;    The real question facing Mr. Bush is how large an SDI system the nation will be able to afford. Regardless of the election outcome, the towering federal deficit means the next president will inherit a flat defense budget and a far different defense climate than the one President Reagan enjoyed when he pumped up Pentagon spending virtually overnight in 1981.    The current Reagan-era defense plan is wildly out of step with today's fiscal realities. The Pentagon now is trying to slice $37.1 billion out of the budget it originally planned to propose for fiscal 1990. But the pain is only beginning: The planned fiscal 1991 budget is being shrunk by $41.3 billion, the fiscal 1992 budget by $45.3 billion and the fiscal 1993 budget by $50.7 billion. Even these cuts assume 2% annual budget growth after inflation, a level many lawmakers consider unrealistically high.    Neither candidate would have total leeway to reorder the defense program. About 60% of the military budget goes for previously drawn contracts and to pay and house military personnel. Meanwhile, a string of big projects nurtured through research and development in the Reagan years are poised to break into the far more costly full-scale-production phase. These include budget-busters such as the Stealth, said to cost over $400 million per plane; the $100 billion Seawolf submarine program; the $35 billion D-5 missile; the $36 billion C-17 cargo plane, and the $45 billion Midgetman missile.    Alongside these hefty costs is the Pentagon's biggest imponderable: SDI, or Star Wars. A decision to deploy the first phase of the anti-missile system would mean outlays of $100 billion or more, adding to the pressure on dozens of other programs.    In the face of this, both candidates acknowledge that Congress won't go along with significant increases in defense spending levels. Mr. Bush's aides say he is likely to seek &quot;zero real growth&quot; in the defense budget, meaning he would propose just enough of an increase to cover inflation. Mr. Dukakis won't offer a specific budget figure, arguing that &quot;one of the things I've learned is that you can't make decisions about spending until you get in and take a look at the books.&quot; But aides say he probably would seek spending levels somewhere between the current budget and a level that would fully cover inflation.    Within that budget, Mr. Dukakis says he would launch a &quot;Conventional Defense Initiative,&quot; to improve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's chances of defeating a Soviet invasion of Europe without resorting to nuclear weapons. Mr. Dukakis says he would develop new anti-tank weapons to offset Soviet advantages in armor; expand U.S. sealift forces to better ferry American reinforcements to Europe; convert three existing light Army divisions to heavier mechanized divisions, and improve air-defense and communications abilities.    Besides canceling some big-ticket strategic programs, Mr. Dukakis says he would find the money for this conventional beefing-up by dropping Reagan plans to add two new aircraft-carrier battle groups and by eliminating unspecified &quot;low-priority&quot; programs.    But equipping to sustain a longer conventional war is expensive. Depending on the site and intensity of the combat, NATO forces today could continue a conventional war in Europe for only about two weeks without losing territory to the Warsaw Pact. Lawrence Korb, formerly an assistant defense secretary in the Reagan administration, estimates that it costs $5 billion to equip Army and Air Force units in Europe for each extra day of combat.    If Mr. Dukakis sought to improve sealift by buying another four or five ships a year to ferry troops, that would cost about $1 billion annually. Improvements in armored strength could run into the billions as well.    But Dukakis aides say their plans wouldn't be as expensive as critics claim because they simply call for better equipping the existing conventional forces, rather than overhauling the West's conventional strategy. They contend the Reagan buildup slighted conventional forces.    Mr. Dukakis says he wouldn't starve nuclear forces in the meantime. He promises to fix flaws in the new fleet of B1 bombers, a task that would run into the billions. &quot;We've got to do whatever it takes to get them airworthy and usable,&quot; he says. Still, the Democrat has left open the possibility that he wouldn't deploy the D-5 submarine-launched missile and the Stealth bomber if arms deals should change the strategic picture or Stealth development doesn't go well.    Bush aides charge that Mr. Dukakis's priorities may be skewed toward simply beefing up front-line forces with armor and ammunition in hopes of offsetting numerical advantages the Warsaw Pact enjoys in both areas. But &quot;we know we can't beat them in the numbers game,&quot; contends former Sen. John Tower, a Bush defense adviser, and therefore should emphasize Western technological superiority.    At the same time, Bush advisers are trying to erase the perception the vice president proposes indiscriminate weapons spending. Eventually &quot;the forces will have to be rationalized,&quot; says one aide, who predicts that there will be some &quot;hard decisions among programs.&quot; An analysis under way in the campaign seeks to define U.S. objectives in various regions and give a rundown of forces and weapons needed to support those goals in each place.    But aides say Mr. Bush fears that proposing cuts now might hurt U.S. leverage in strategic-arms negotiations with the Soviets. In future spending levels, &quot;a great deal might depend on our dealings with the Soviets,&quot; Mr. Tower says.    No matter who he is, the next president will be forced to try to improve the byzantine Pentagon purchasing procedures at the center of the current defense purchasing scandals. Mr. Bush will push for management changes suggested by the Packard Commission three years ago to &quot;maximize the return you get on each dollar in defense,&quot; says Dennis Ross, who coordinates national-security issues for the campaign. Former Sen. Tower says Mr. Bush would press Congress to simplify its role in procurement and permit more contracts that can't be tampered with each year.    Mr. Dukakis also backs the Packard Commission suggestions. But his supporters stress more the governor's managerial talents, as evidence he would be a true Pentagon reformer.    &quot;The Pentagon needs a good housecleaning, and you're unlikely to get it under Bush because he's a member of the status quo,&quot; argues Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, an informal Dukakis adviser. &quot;We need a tough new manager.&quot;    ---        Bush vs. Dukakis: Different Defense Priorities   BIG-TICKET ITEMS BUSH WANTS   -- Midgetman missile. Cost: $45 billion.   -- Rail-car launchers for MX Missiles. Cost: $8.5 billion.   -- Complete 15 aircraft-carrier battle groups. Cost: $18 billion.   -- Deploy first phase of Star Wars. Cost: $100 billion or more.   PROJECTS TO CUT   -- None identified so far.   CRITIC'S CHARGE   -- By trying to buy so many weapons during a budget squeeze, he would create a &quot;hollow arsenal&quot; in which Army units would lack spare parts and ammunition.   BIG-TICKET ITEMS DUKAKIS WANTS   -- Stronger conventional defenses in Europe. Estimated cost: $5 billion to equip each additional day of war-fighting.   -- More ships to ferry troops. Estimated cost: $1 billion a year.   -- C-17 transport plane. Cost: $36 billion.   PROJECTS TO CUT   -- Midgetman; MX rail launchers; Star Wars would be pared; Navy would be trimmed to 13 carrier battle groups.   CRITIC'S CHARGE   -- By dumping the two land-based missiles; he would weaken the nuclear deterrent and lessen U.S. negotiating leverage with the Soviets.</TEXT></DOC>
