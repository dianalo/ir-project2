These amendments are required to comply with changes toTitle 38, United States Code, enacted by the Veterans Benefits and ServicesAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-322) and the Veterans Health Care Amendments of1985 (Pub. L. 99-166) as well as to include the MEDIPRO program. Title38, United States Code, section 3305, requires the Secretary of the Departmentof Veterans Affairs to specify, by regulation, activities which the Departmentwishes to make part of the VA's medical quality assurance programs forwhich the records are protected by section 3305. Because this act explicityprecludes any activity from being designated as a quality assurance programactivity for the purposes of confidentiality unless such designation hasbeen specified in regulation, it has been necessary to develop these regulations.The Department gave interested parties 30 days to submit comments on theproposed regulations. Some comments were received in response to the noticeof proposed rulemaking and have been considered in the final rule. TheSecretary has also considered internal Department comments in draftingthis final rule as a means of clarifying or interpreting specific regulatoryrequirements.Two comments were received which suggested that andSection; 17.506(a), ContinuousMonitoring, be amended to include medical facility-specific service monitorsand medical facilitywide monitors. One commenter pointed out that medicalfacility clinical services are required by the Joint Commission on Accreditationof Healthcare Organizations, an organization which VA contracts with foraccreditation purposes, to conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation ofthe quality, appropriateness and safety of patient care services. The commentersuggested that andSection;andSection; 17.506(a)(5) through 17.506(a)(7) beincorporated into a new continuous monitoring element, service level continuousmonitors. Another commenter pointed out that medical facilitywide monitorsemploying generic criteria are used to look at aspects of quality and appropriatenessof care that spans all services or quality assurance activities. The Secretarybelieves that because these comments, in effect, propose additional activitiesfor protection by section 3305 rather than commenting on the changes underconsideration, the comments are outside the scope of the proposed regulationand cannot be accepted. The Department, however, will take the suggestionsunder advisement.One commenter stated that credentialing and privileging are an integralpart of the VA quality assurance program and should not be deleted as oneof the five mandatory Health Services Review Organization-Systematic InternalReview (HSRO-SIR) functions. While the Secretary firmly agrees that credentialingand privileging are important elements of the VA medical facility qualityassurance program, the confidentiality protections provided by 38 U.S.C.3305 and these regulations are no longer required for the credentialingand privileging function because of the overriding public interest in permittingaccess to information about VA practitioner credentials and clinical privileges.Removing credentialing and privileging from these regulations does notalter the medical center requirement to implement the function. The Secretaryfirmly supports the use of credentialing and privileging as an integralpart of the medical facilities' quality assurance activities. These activitiesare essential to the effective monitoring of the performance and competencyof individual practitioners. However, for the purpose of confidentiality,credentialing and privileging are being removed from the medical facilities'HSRO-SIR program, as defined by these regulations. The Department plansto establish policy which would clarify further that credentialing andprivileging are fundamental quality assurance activities, and, to providemedical facilities with guidance on the conduct and performance of theseactivities.Section 17.516(c) has been amended to state that confidential records protectedby a specific statute, such as HSRO records (for example, occurrence screeningdata) do not lose their statutory protection when examined in the courseof a protected HSRO quality assurance activity.Furthermore, andSection; 17.527(c) states that persons who are legally entitledto have access to records protected by section 3305 and these regulationsand who have a need for access to confidential and privileged HSRO recordsand documents can be authorized access by the VA medical facility director.The Secretary believes that such access is reasonable for the VA medicalfacility medical staff designated to perform credentialing and privilegingactivities. (Additionally, andSection; 17.527(c) states that confidentialand privileged HSRO records and documents retain confidentiality protectionsunder 38 U.S.C. 3305 when used in the HSRO program.) However, records protectedby section 3305 and these regulations may not be used to restrict, reduceor revoke privileges.The VA has reconsidered whether the ``predetermined list of criteria''referenced in andSection; 17.507(xvi), Occurrence Screening, is meant torefer only to criteria specified by the Chief Medical Director in policydirectives. Occurrence screening must be performed in accordance with VHSandamp;RApolicy directives. The predetermined criteria specified in the presentVHSandamp;RA policy are viewed as an appropriate, minimal set of requirementsthat medical facilities are to establish in their occurrence screeningcontinuous monitoring activity. The Secretary agrees, however, that othercriteria may be established and applied by medical facilities; any locallyadopted criteria are protected by these regulations, provided the criteriaconform to any relevant VHSandamp;RA directives and are approved in advanceof implementation by the facility director. This can be accomplished ina variety of ways including, for example, having the facility directorspecifically approve and adopt in writing the quality assurance plan orindividual committee minutes which contain such criteria. The descriptionof the occurrence screening continuous monitoring activity, andSection; 17.507(a)(4)(xvi),has been modified, therefore, to support the Secretary's interpretationof that policy.Sections 17.514(f) and 17.518(b)(4) have also been added to make clearthat contractors evaluating a MEDIPRO activity(ies) or performing a MEDIPROfunction are covered by these regulations. VHSandamp;RA is not planning tohave any MEDIPRO functions performed under contract at this time.The proposed rule is adopted as final with the amendments noted above.VA has determined that these regulations are not a major rule as definedby Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. They will not have an effecton the economy of $100 million and will not result in any major increasesin costs or prices for anyone; nor will they have significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation or theability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulations will not, when promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-602.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulations are, therefore, exempt fromthe regulatory analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The reasonfor this certification is that the regulations are for the express purposeof implementing laws intended to establish a VA quality assurance program,affect only a small category of confidential VA records, and impose noregulatory burdens on small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 17</ITAG>Alcoholism, Claims, Dental health, Drug abuse, Foreign relations, Governmentcontracts, Grant programs-health, Health care, Health facilities, Healthprofessions, Medical devices, Medical research, Mental health programs,Nursing home care, Philippines, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.

Theplan will be reviewed annually by the HSRO-MEDIPRO board, updated as appropriateand will address the following subjects:(1) Purpose of HSRO-MEDIPRO program.(2) Program objectives.(3) HSRO-MEDIPRO board structure and functions.(4) Use of physician/dental advisors.(5) HSRO-MEDIPRO staff roles and responsibilities.(6) Meeting schedule and protocol.(7) Review process.(8) Plans for periodic reliability checks on HSRO-MEDIPRO staff and physician/dentaladvisors.(9) Reporting.(10) Relationship to other district councils.(b) HSRO-MEDIPRO provides a means for representative VA health care professionalsto evaluate VA medical facility, patient and practitioner records and documentsto assess the quality of care and appropriateness of resource utilization.The goal of the HSRO-MEDIPRO program is to foster quality care under aprospective resource allocation methodology. HSRO-MEDIPRO is designed tofunction as a data driven system which combines data analysis and subsequentchart review to focus peer review activities. HSRO-MEDIPRO is intendedto augment and not duplicate existing VA quality assurance activities includingHSRO-SIR and HSRO-SERP.(c) EAch HSRO-MEDIPRO program, in accordance with any directives from theChief Medical Director, will establish uniform procedures and conduct peerreview activities including, but not limited to, the following:(1) Analyzing data to identify potential problems in quality of care orvalidity of data and to develop and review objectives on a regular basis.VA data sources include, but are not limited to, Patient Treatment File(PTF), records maintained on the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program(DHCP), tort claims, incident reports, and Automated Management InformationSystem (AMIS). Problem areas may be indicated by statistically significantvariations between appropriate medical district, regional or national peergroup patterns of care. The following categories are examples of potentialproblem areas for the purpose of HSRO-MEDIPRO data analysis and focusedreview and these regulations:(i) Mortality.(ii) Interhospital transfers.(iii) Interservice transfers.(iv) Inpatient admissions/readmissions.(v) Applicants found not in need of care.(vi) One-day inpatient stays.(vii) Length of stay by Diagnostic Related Group (DRG).(viii) Discharge planning.(ix) Appropriateness of levels of care such as acute care, long-term care,and ambulatory care.(x) Ancillary services.(2) Selecting topics for focused review. HSRO-MEDIPRO boards, in accordancewith any directives from the Chief Medical Director, will select and prioritizetopics for review based on medical district, regional and national considerations.Such considerations may include, for example, topics which reflect deviationsof clinical indicators from VA system norms; topics which reflect largenumbers of patients or serious consequences such as death or disability;topics which are likely to reflect systemwide problems related to resourceallocation systems and other VA cost containment efforts; and topics whichlend themselves to intervention at the medical center level.(3) Generating clinical hypotheses and study objectives. Each HSRO-MEDIPROboard and staff will generate clinical hypotheses and study objectivesfor focused review topics.(4) Developing criteria. HSRO-MEDIPRO board and staff will develop and/oruse specific, objective criteria to guide records review and analysis.A variety of resources may be used in the development of criteria includingpreviously developed criteria and physician and dental advisor expertise.(5) Conducting focused review and, as necessary, referring records andother documents to physician/dental advisors for peer review. Focused reviewrefers to the review of a well-defined, limited or structured topic bya health professional peer in order to evaluate a potential quality ofcare problem or opportunity for improvement. Peer review refers to an assessmentby health care practitioners of services ordered or furnished by otherpractitioners in the same professional field.(6) Sharing findings with VA medical facilities, HSRO-MEDIPRO will providemedical facilities with information relative to quality of care and practicepatterns. Such information may include practitioner-specific and aggregatedistrict, region and national data. VA medical facilities will use thesefindings in their HSRO-SIR program to document statisfactory or superiorquality of care and to identify areas where attention should be directed.If necessary, medical centers will take action to correct identified problemsor make improvements through appropriate interventions such as educationand training of VA medical staff or management. Other HSRO-MEDIPRO informationthat may be provided to medical facilities includes study criteria, datavalidation information, HSRO-MEDIPRO study summaries pertaining to themedical center, HSRO-MEDIPRO minutes and quarterly reports, and lettersof observation indicating potential problems found in areas other thanthe topic under consideration for focused review.(7) Resolving facility disagreement with HSRO-MEDIPRO study findings. Medicalfacilities may communicate in writing to the HSRO-MEDIPRO board where thereis a disagreement over the findings of a HSRO-MEDIPRO study. The HSRO-MEDIPROboard will review all such medical facility documents; unresolved issueswill be referred to the appropriate regional director for action.(8) Providing HSRO-MEDIPRO board followup as necessary. HSRO-MEDIPRO boards,in accordance with any directives from the Chief Medical Director, willconduct followup evaluations of medical center actions after an appropriateperiod of time has elapsed.(9) Integrating findings with the appropriate VHSandamp;RA organizationalelements. HSRO-MEDIPRO will report periodically on its findings and followupactions to the respective regional director and to the Director, Officeof Quality Assurance. Where study findings have implications for planningor resource allocation purposes, communication should occur with the appropriateorganizational unit, e.g., the District Planning Board or the DistrictExecutive Council.(d) VA may conduct a health care review(s) of HSRO-MEDIPRO to determinethe effectiveness of the HSRO-MEDIPRO program in meeting its objectives,assess compliance with relevant policies and procedures, validate medicalrecord reviews and to accomplish other similar objectives.(e) Each medical district will have an HSRO-MEDIPRO board consisting ofclinically active VA physicians and dentists to conduct HSRO-MEDIPRO activities.The membership and selection process for the HSRO-MEDIPRO boards will bedetermined by VA policy directive(s).(f) A medical district or the VHSandamp;RA may contract in writing with non-VApersonnel or entities for the performance of MEDIPRO activities or functionsor for an evaluation of MEDIPRO activities or functions. An evaluationof MEDIPRO activities or functions, whether performed by VA personnel orby a contractor, is a MEDIPRO activity.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3305)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 17.515</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Removed]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 17.516, and 17.517</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Redesignated as andSection;andSection; 17.515 and 17.516]</ITAG>8. a.
