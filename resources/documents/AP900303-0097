So far, the transition talks have been incredibly smooth.   ``It's all going peacefully, very peacefully,'' President-electVioleta Barrios de Chamorro told The Associated Press.   Transition talks started Wednesday, just two days afterPresident Daniel Ortega conceded defeat in a moving speech.   Both sides lost no time in naming transition teams: Mrs.Chamorro chose her son-in-law and campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo,to head the efforts of the 14-party UNO coalition. Ortega chose hisbrother and Defense Minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega.   After a campaign that saw the worst in the political traditionof mud-slinging and outright threats, experienced observers areamazed at both sides' conciliatory attitude.   ``They're moving around each other very, very carefully,'' aninternational observer said. ``We're doing our best to nurture thatattitude.''   The promoters and caretakers of this new cooperative attitudehave been dubbed the ``Holy Trinity.''   One of the three, Elliot Richardson, former U.S. attorneygeneral and special representative of U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar, even wrote President Ortega a fan letter.   ``Your attitude today constitutes an act of true leadership,''Richardson wrote of Ortega's speech. ``You can count, Mr.President, with my sincere admiration and respect.''   La Prensa, Mrs. Chamorro's family daily and for the 10{ years ofSandinista rule Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper, has beenemphasizing cooperation and reconciliation of this war-torn nation.It repeatedly calls Mrs. Chamorro a ``president of ALLNicaraguans.''   On its front page Friday, La Prensa ran a story with UNOdenouncing Sandinista distribution of weapons to supporters andanother story with the U.S.-supported Contra rebels sayingSandinista soldiers are deserting.   But this time the newspaper also ran a story with a SandinistaPeople's Army spokeswoman denying both reports. Before, it wouldhave derided any official denial of disruptions in the army.   ``Some of my friends are hard-line Sandinistas and I've seentheir faces: they're stunned,'' an UNO strategist said. ``But myattitude is not to gloat in front of them. We have to treat themdelicately.''   Indeed, the little that the press has been allowed to know ofthe transition talks has indicated a show of restraint and delicacyon both parts.   As the talks progress, UNO leaders have issued measured, soberstatements whose obvious intention is to calm the waters.   ``We are going to guarantee the orderly, peaceful and democratictransmission of the supreme command of the republic, as correspondsto the sacred interests of Nicaragua and the desires of theNicaraguan people,'' Lacayo said.   Calming the waters is something very much needed, as theSandinistas nurse the wounds of defeat and deal with the alarmingthought that some of their dearest ``achievements of therevolution'' might be reversed.   After his speech Monday, President Ortega met with more than1,000 top Sandinista cadres, and delivered a fiery address to15,000 angry and fearful supporters waiting outside a conventionhall.   ``The day will come when we will govern from above again becausethe Sandinista National Liberation Front will stay with the people,governing from below,'' he said.   The words pointed to a Sandinista commitment to play thepolitical game.   Except for a subsequent statement by Mrs. Chamorro (``I'm theone who's going to give the orders''), there's been no balking byUNO so far about the positions Ortega outlined for a peacefultransition of power.   Mutual accommodation seems to be the attitude of both parties.   Just hours after Ortega demanded the dismantling of theU.S.-supported Contra rebels, Mrs. Chamorro urged the guerrillas tocome home and rejoin civilian life to help reconstruct Nicaragua.   President Bush issued a similar call to the rebels, who are inHonduran jungle camps. And the Honduran president sent a specialrepresentative to Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro to work out plans forthe rebels' decommissioning.   Now it only remains to persuade the rebels to return before Mrs.Chamorro is inaugurated April 25.   Addressing another Sandinista demand, UNO leaders said they willname a civilian defense minister, but Gen. Ortega will remain incommand of the army.   UNO will set up a special tribunal to hear claims from peoplewhose property was confiscated by the Sandinistas.   But peasants who benefitted from the Sandinistas' agrarianreform _ some 100,000 families _ will keep their property and willeven be given ownership titles to replace the Sandinista land-usecertificates. Property confiscated from dictator Anastasio Somozawill remain so.   The banking system will remain nationalized, UNO leaders havesaid, allaying Sandinista fears. But true to its pro-capitalisticpolicies, UNO also plans to allow private banks.   For their part, the Sandinistas have allowed young soldiers todesert. That move is geared both to weeding the armed forces ofnon-Sandinista members and easing the shift to the time when Mrs.Chamorro, as she has promised, bans the mandatory two-year draftfor boys age 16.   The transition talks have been at the local offices of theCarter Center. Former President Jimmy Carter, considered the``father'' of the ``Holy Trinity,'' has taken the commanding leadin drawing UNO and Sandinistas to the bargaining table to talk andreason together.   Joao Baena Soares, the secretary-general of the Organization ofAmerican States is the third component in the triad.   The short two months remaining until the new administrationstarts will be a time of great change and of promise to Nicaragua'sfuture.   If all goes well, it will be the first time in Nicaragua'shistory that one government hands over power peacefully to another,a remarkable achievement.</TEXT></DOC>
