The July figure, which compares with 6.1% in June, shows that job growth in the U.S. continues to outstrip even the most optimistic forecasts. The unemployment rate has fallen sharply from the 6.7% rate in January and from its peak of 10.8% in December 1982. It is now at its lowest since December 1979.    Using a separate measure that counts members of the military among the employed, the jobless rate dropped to 5.9% in July. President Reagan noted it was the first time in eight years that this figure had gone below 6%.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board reported that consumer credit expanded at a rapid annual 7.6% rate in June, after dropping at a 0.7% annual rate the previous month.    According to a theory popular in the late 1970s, further declines in the unemployment rate could spark increased inflation. &quot;I, for one, get very nervous at these unemployment rates,&quot; says Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. &quot;Wages have been remarkably well-behaved so far, but at the unemployment rates we have today, we are going to begin to see continuing inflationary pressures.&quot;    Other analysts argue, however, that changes in the makeup of the population mean the U.S. economy can continue to reduce unemployment without sparking inflation. They note, for instance, that teenagers make up less of the work force today than they did a decade ago. Because teenagers leave jobs more often than adults, their reduced presence in the work force tends to lower temporary unemployment.    &quot;If you look at the composition of the work force, you have to conclude the unemployment rate can go lower now than would have been safe 10 years ago,&quot; says George Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.    &quot;I think we're still a year away from having to worry about tight labor markets contributing to inflation,&quot; agrees John McAuley, an economist at R.H. Wrightson Associates in New York.    President Reagan, in his statement, said it was important to note that the decline in unemployment did &quot;not occur in a hyper-inflated economy, as it did in 1979, but is based instead on sound growth and steady long-term job creation.&quot;    And Labor Secretary William Brock released a statement saying that &quot;America's remarkable ability to create jobs attests to the fundamental strength of our economy and the soundness of our market-oriented policies.&quot;    However, the rapid job growth in the face of a sluggish economy suggests that worker productivity, or the output per hour of work, is still growing very slowly. Productivity growth is the key to the nation's ability to compete in the world and to continued growth in the living standards of Americans.    Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, warned that the employment figures during the summer months are very volatile because of students entering the work force. In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, she said, &quot;We really need additional months of data to determine the significance of the July change.&quot;    The Labor Department's measure of non-farm payroll employment showed a strong increase of 304,000 in July, including a rise of 70,000 in manufacturing jobs. That suggests that the economy grew at a rapid pace during the month and that manufacturers are showing solid gains as a result of the improving trade deficit. In June, payroll employment rose 103,000, with factory jobs rising 10,000.    The drop in unemployment was concentrated among men, while adult women saw their jobless rate rise to 5.4% in July from 5.2% in June. The rate for adult men dropped to 5.4% from 5.5%. The rate for teen-agers fell to 15.5% from 15.9%.    Blacks and Hispanics also benefited from the July improvement. The jobless rate for blacks edged down to 12.6% from 12.7% in June. The rate for Hispanics dropped to 7.9% from 8.5%.    Average hourly earnings rose to $8.96 in July from $8.94 in June. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, increased to 173.2% of its 1977 average from 172.9% in June.    Average weekly hours fell to 34.7 in July from 34.8 in June.    All the figures are adjusted to take account of seasonal variations.    Consumer credit expanded a seasonally adjusted $3.46 billion in June, after declining $318 million in May, the Fed reported. The change largely reflected a resumption of heavy lending for automobiles. Auto credit expanded an adjusted $1.96 billion in June, after falling $85 million in May.    Revolving credit, which includes retail and bank-card borrowing, rose an adjusted $389 million in June, after rising $163 million the earlier month. Miscellaneous credit, including cash loans and certain retail financing contracts, expanded $957 million after falling $312 million.    At the end of June, consumer installment debt totaled $585.31 billion, before seasonal adjustment, up 6.4% from a year earlier.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
