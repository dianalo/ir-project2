National Medical, one of the nation's largest operators of hospitals and other health-care facilities, reported that profit fell to $29 million, or 38 cents a share, from $37.9 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.    Revenue rose 17%, to $1.01 billion, from $862.5 million a year earlier. Profit before taxes increased slightly, to $69.4 million from $67.6 million.    The latest period reflected a 58% overall tax rate, compared with a 43% rate a year earlier. Recent tax law changes eliminated tax credits in the current fiscal year, requiring the company to reverse $4.4 million in tax credits it previously had taken, it said.    Richard K. Eamer, chairman and chief executive officer, said tax changes lowered profit about $10 million, or 13 cents a share, in the latest period.    Mr. Eamer said the new tax law, while resulting in a short-term drop in earnings, is expected to mean overall tax rates of 40% or less in the future.    In the six months ended Nov. 30, profit slipped 10%, to $65.2 million, or 78 cents a share, from $72.7 million, or 92 cents a share. Revenue rose 20%, to $2.01 billion from $1.67 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
