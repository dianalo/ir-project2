IBM's report fell within expectations, and the stock slid back$1.25 to $114.75 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading,erasing its $1.25 gain from Monday. Apple took a bigger hit, sliding$1.50 to $39.25 in late over-the-counter dealings.   The second-quarter profit increase at IBM was unusually largebecause results a year ago had been depressed by a one-time $600million charge to cover the cost of cuts in manufacturing andheadquarters operations.   Excluding that charge, earnings per share would have risen about3.1 percent.   Analysts said they were impressed by IBM's revenue growth, whichappeared to be in double digits both overseas and in the UnitedStates, where sales had been weak. The company said sales weregrowing across its product line, from personal computers tomainframes.   IBM Chairman John F. Akers has been moving employees into salesand marketing jobs since 1987, which the company declared the yearof the customer.   ``These are the first measurable results of the back-to-the-fieldmove,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, an analyst at Annex Research Inc. inPhoenix.   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it earned $1.34 billion in thequarter, or $2.31 a share, in comparison with earnings of $964million, or $1.63 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.4 percentto $15.2 billion from $13.9 billion.   For the first six months of the year, IBM said its earnings rose3.5 percent to $2.29 billion, or $3.92 a share, from $2.21 billion,or $3.73 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to $27.9billion from $26 billion.   Apple's results disappointed investors. Sales of most productsexcept the Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh SE30 are sluggish, and thecompany continues to hire, resulting in a squeeze between costs andrevenue, said John McManus, an analyst at Thomson McKinnonSecurities Inc. in New York.   ``They're losing some momentum in the marketplace and thatconcerns me,'' he said.   The Cupertino, Calif.-based personal computer maker said earningsin its third fiscal quarter ended June 30 rose to $96.1 million, or74 cents a share, from $91.3 million, or 71 cents a share, a yearearlier. Revenue rose to $1.25 billion from $993 million a yearearlier.   For the first nine months, Apple said its earnings rose less than1 percent to $293 million, or $2.28 a share, from $292 million, or$2.24 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.9 billion from$2.9 billion.   Apple said it continued to be hurt by higher component costs,especially for memory chips, which it bought when they were at theirhighest price.</TEXT></DOC>
