GAF, which has held a little-publicized stake of about 4.9% in Cabot for two years, confirmed it asked the Federal Trade Commission for clearance to boost its holdings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act on Aug. 1. The Wayne, N.J., chemicals concern, headed by the investor Samuel Heyman, first disclosed its Cabot stake in a 1986 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a company spokesman said.    Reacting to the GAF filing, Cabot changed its so-called poison pill anti-takeover defense to include a needling reference to GAF's recent indictment as part of Wall Street's continuing insider-trading scandal. A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted the company and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, for offenses stemming from their alleged manipulation of Union Carbide common stock in 1986.    Cabot amended its poison pill so it would be triggered if, among other things, at least 15% of the company's common stock were held by a person who is the target of any governmental investigation or action. If triggered, the plan would allow Cabot holders to buy Cabot stock at half the market price, a tactic intended to make any hostile takeover of the company prohibitively expensive.    The pill, designed by the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom, may be the first takeover defense to attempt to capitalize on the insider-trading scandal. Because several other major takeover players are under investigation, the strategy could be copied by other target companies. Lewis Goodman, a Skadden attorney in Boston, said the idea was an &quot;appropriate&quot; way to customize Cabot's defenses.    GAF's Mr. Heyman was out of the country and couldn't be reached for comment. But a GAF spokesman said over the weekend: &quot;We have no comment whatsoever with regard to Cabot's mean-spirited response to our company's filing.&quot;    It was unclear what, if anything, GAF intended by its Hart-Scott filing. Such a filing doesn't necessarily mean a suitor will buy up to 25% of a target company's shares. GAF has reaped an estimated $450 million in pre-tax profits attempting takeovers of Union Carbide Corp. and Borg Warner Corp., but besides the indictment, it currently is involved in a drawn-out attempt to take the company private.    Cabot, meanwhile, has frequently been mentioned as a takeover or restructuring candidate. On Friday, the company's stock closed at $34 a share, down 50 cents in light composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on about 27 million shares outstanding, Cabot has a market value of $918 million.    Analysts have pushed the company to sell or spin off its energy businesses, which include oil and gas production and natural gas pipelines. Michael J. Harris, an analyst with Morgan Keegan andamp; Co. in Memphis, suggests such a restructuring could be valued as high as $55 a share, while a takeover could reap as much as $65 a share to $80 a share. Cabot's specialty chemicals businesses, principally its carbon black products, are immensely profitable, he said, while its energy businesses &quot;are a real albatross around Cabot's neck.&quot;    The two companies have had several conversations, but Cabot sources said Mr. Heyman hasn't given any indication of his intentions. GAF sources, however, have characterized Cabot as &quot;a tired company&quot; ripe for a takeover.    At a closed-door meeting between Cabot executives and analysts this spring in New York, a GAF representative stood and read aloud a statement advocating a restructuring of Cabot, including the spin-off or sale of its energy businesses, a GAF spokesman confirmed.    After that, said Morgan Keegan's Mr. Harris, Cabot officials told him they were studying such a restructuring. But as GAF became involved in its buy-out effort and governmental proceedings, and as Cabot's stock price slid, executives' interest in the restructuring seemed to wane. &quot;I think they perceived the pressure from GAF was off,&quot; Mr. Harris said.    Cabot possesses one defense that would make any takeover attempt by Mr. Heyman or anyone else more difficult: a large, friendly stake, estimated at as much as one-third of its common shares, in the hands of various members of the Cabot family. Family members have been selling shares in recent months, though, and a Cabot spokesman said the company is unable to accurately estimate family members' current total holdings. </TEXT></DOC>
