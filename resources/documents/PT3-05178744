No. 07/373,974,      filed Jun. 30, 1989. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field Of The Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an oxygen sensor device. More      particularly, the present invention is concerned with an oxygen sensor      device having a glass dome fluid-tightly connected at its circumferential      base edge to one surface of an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate      to form a diffusion chamber defined by the glass dome and the solid      electrolyte plate. The oxygen sensor device is advantageous from the      viewpoints of miniaturization, power consumption saving and reliability.      The advantageous oxygen sensor device can be efficiently produced by a      novel method, in which a burnable material layer, a porous antifire      material layer or a combination of a burnable material layer and a porous      antifire material layer is formed on an oxygen conductive solid      electrolyte plate and a powdery glass-containing pasty material is coated      thereon, followed by firing. By virtue of the novel method, it is possible      to perform continuous mass production of the oxygen sensor device at low      cost, with the minimized occurrence of defectives. </PAR><PAR>  2. Discussion Of Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Oxygen determining devices are required when human beings must work in      confined spaces, such as mines, tanks, etc. Oxygen determining devices are      also requisite in extremely diversified fields, such as space ships and      capsules, submarines for naval and civilian use, medical treatment, food      pack inspection as well as combustion control and other environmental      studies. Although several types of oxygen sensor devices have been      proposed, there is still a strong demand for a small reliable oxygen      sensor device. </PAR><PAR>  A representative form of the conventional oxygen sensor device is shown in      FIG. 1. The device comprises diffusion housing 104, oxygen conductive      plate 101 of solid electrolyte hermetically bonded at its one surface to      diffusion housing 104 by sealing glass 107, and a pair of circular      electrode layers 102A and 102B secured to the opposite sides of conductive      plate 101, respectively. Electrodes 102A and 102B are connected to a DC      power source. For example, the oxygen conductive plate 101 </PAR><PAR>  comprises a solid solution containing ZrO.sub.2, Y.sub.2 O.sub.3, MgO and      CaO. Each of electrode layers 102A and 102B is porous and is made of, for      example, platinum. Diffusion housing 104 has orifice 105 (gas inlet means)      of a small diameter formed through the wall of the housing. The diffusion      of oxygen from the monitored gas environment through gas inlet means 105      into chamber 103 of diffusion housing 104 is effected by the application      of a DC potential from a power source across two electrodes 102A and 102B      to pump the oxygen present in chamber 103 through oxygen conductive plate      101. As the potential across two electrodes 102A and 102B is increased,      electrical current flowing through two electrodes 102A and 102B is      changed. The current limited by the oxygen diffusion becomes stable so      that a stable diffusion limited current value is obtained. The diffusion      limited current value is proportional to the concentration of oxygen in      the monitored gas environment, and therefore the oxygen concentration can      be detected by measuring the diffusion limited current value through a      current meter (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,285). </PAR><PAR>  In another conventional oxygen sensor device, the diffusion housing is made      of an open-cell porous structure, with the gas inlet means omitted. With      this construction, the oxygen diffuses into the chamber defined by the      housing and the electrolyte plate through the pores of the housing. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, it is desired that the oxygen sensor device have a small size,      because, with the small size, it is easy to heat up the device and perform      temperature control at the time of oxygen determination, and the oxygen      sensor device can be applied to oxygen determination even when the space      at the oxygen determination site is limited. In manufacturing the      above-mentioned conventional oxygen sensor devices, miniaturization of the      device to a size of some millimeters is accompanied by difficulties in the      fabrication and assembly of components, such as housing and solid      electrolyte. For example, diffusion housing 104 is made of a hard      material, such as that prepared by firing a ceramic. It is very difficult      to rework such a hard material into a diffusion housing of small size      which has complicated configuration. Further, it is also very difficult to      fluid-tightly connect such a small diffusion housing to a solid      electrolyte plate. In particular, the connection of the diffusion housing      to the solid electrolyte plate is carried out by applying sealing glass      and then melting the glass in a high-temperature oven. However, this      operation is likely to cause positional displacement, thereby leading to a      high ratio of defectives. Because of the above-mentioned difficulties, the      conventional oxygen sensor devices is likely to lack reliability in      quality, and the productivity of the devices is disadvantageously low. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,605 discloses an improved method for manufacturing an      oxygen sensor device In the improved method, a green sheet is used. The      terminology &quot;green sheet&quot; used herein means a flexible plate or sheet      comprising ceramic particles bound with a plasticizer, such as that      prepared by first blending together a powdery ceramic, an organic resin      plasticizer, e.g., polyethylene glycol, and a solvent, e.g., water and an      alcohol, secondly extruding the resultant blend through rolls or a slit      into a sheet and thirdly evaporating the solvent at a temperature, e.g.      100.degree. to 500.degree. C. A representative mode of this improved      method is described below. First, a layer of a burnable resin material is      disposed on the cathode side of an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte      plate sandwiched between a porous cathode and a porous anode. Secondly, a      pin-shaped protrusion made of the same resin material or of a hard plastic      or an aluminum filament each having a low melting temperature is embedded      in the layer of the burnable resin material. Thirdly, the above-mentioned      green sheet is disposed on the layer of the burnable resin material. At      this time, the protrusion passes through the layer. Finally, firing is      performed. As a result, the plasticizer, the resin material and 5 the hard      plastic are burnt, and the aluminum filament is melted off. Thus, an      oxygen sensor device comprising an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte      plate sandwiched between a porous cathode and a porous anode and a ceramic      diffusion housing connected at its circumferential base edge to the      cathode side of the solid electrolyte plate, is obtained, having a similar      structure to that of FIG. 1. In this method, the firing must be performed      at a temperature as high as about 1600.degree. C. This high temperature      firing is likely to damage the pore structure of the cathode and anode,      because the pore structure of each electrode is adversely affected at a      temperature of higher than 1000.degree. C. Also, the temperature as high      as about 1600.degree. C. is likely to cause deformation of the electrolyte      plate. Therefore, it is very difficult to produce continuously such a type      of oxygen sensor with uniform, excellent quality on a commercial scale. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies with a view      toward obviating the drawbacks of the prior art. As a result, the      inventors have unexpectedly found that an oxygen sensor device which is      desirable from the viewpoints of miniaturization, power consumption saving      and reliability can be realized by a structure in which a glass dome is      fluid-tightly connected at its circumferential base edge to one surface of      an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate. In view of the general      knowledge with respect to the properties of glasses, it is surprising that      an oxygen sensor device, the housing of which is constructed of a glass      dome, can endure heat hysteresis caused by the change of temperature in      the range of from room temperature (at the time the sensor is not working)      to about 500.degree. C or higher (at the time the sensor is working).      Moreover, the inventors have found that the desirable oxygen sensor device      can be efficiently produced by first forming a burnable material layer, a      porous antifire material layer or a composite layer of burnable material      and porous antifire material on an electrode-carrying oxygen conductive      solid electrolyte, and coating thereon, e.g., by screen printing, a      powdery glass-containing pasty material, followed by firing at a      relatively low temperature, e.g. 600.degree. to 1000.degree. C. It is also      surprising that the presence of the porous antifire material layer in the      chamber defined by the glass dome and the solid electrolyte does not      adversely affect the diffusion of gas and the sensitivity of the ultimate      oxygen sensor device. Based on these novel findings, the present invention      has been completed. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel      oxygen sensor device which is desirable from the viewpoints of      miniaturization, power consumption saving and reliability. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present      invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and      appended claims taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the accompanying drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of a typical form of the      conventional oxygen sensor device;

</PAR><PAR>  a first electrode and a second electrode respectively disposed on the upper      surface and the lower surface of said solid electrolyte plate; </PAR><PAR>  a first electric lead means and a second electric lead means respectively      for connecting said first and second electrodes to power source means; and </PAR><PAR>  a glass dome fluid-tightly connected at its circumferential base edge to      the upper surface of said solid electrolyte plate to provide at least one      diffusion chamber defined by said glass dome and said solid electrolyte      plate, said glass dome comprising at least one glass layer; </PAR><PAR>  said glass dome or said solid electrolyte plate having a gas inlet means      for diffusing ambient gas into said diffusion chamber; </PAR><PAR>  said oxygen sensor device being operable by energizing said solid      electrolyte plate, so that oxygen is pumped out of said diffusion chamber      through said solid electrolyte plate to flow electric current across said      first and second electrodes, said electric current being indicative of the      partial pressure of the oxygen in the ambient gas. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference      to the accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAR>  In the oxygen sensor device of the present invention, the diffusion chamber      defined by the glass dome and the solid electrolyte plate having a pair of      electrodes disposed on the upper surface and the lower surface thereof may      be vacant, or may have a porous inorganic material packing layer fixedly      disposed in the entire space thereof. Alternatively, the diffusion chamber      may have a porous inorganic material semi-packing layer fixedly disposed      in an upper portion thereof remote from the electrolyte plate, while      leaving vacant the remainder of the chamber. The vacant diffusion chamber,      the diffusion chamber having the packing layer and the diffusion chamber      having the semi-packing layer are shown in FIGS. 2 to 4, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, numeral 1 designates a solid electrolyte plate      having oxygen ion conductivity upon energization of the electrolyte,      numerals 2A and 2B porous platinum electrodes formed on the surfaces of      solid electrolyte plate 1, numeral 4 a glass dome, numeral 5 cracks formed      in glass dome 4 as a gas inlet means, and numerals 6A and 6B electric lead      means respectively connected to porous electrodes 2A and 2B. Glass dome 4      and electrode-carrying solid electrolyte plate 1 define vacant diffusion      chamber 3. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 3, porous inorganic material packing layer 3A is fixedly disposed      in the entire space of the diffusion chamber defined by glass dome 4 and      solid electrolyte plate 1. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 4, porous inorganic material semi-packing layer 3B is fixedly      disposed in an upper portion of the diffusion chamber defined by glass      dome 4 and solid electrolyte plate 1, which upper portion is remote from      solid electrolyte plate 1, while leaving vacant the remainder of the      diffusion chamber to form vacant portion 3C. </PAR><PAR>  In the oxygen sensor device of the present invention, there are no      particular limitations with respect to the thickness of the glass dome,      the thickness of the porous inorganic material packing or semi-packing      layer and the thickness of the solid electrolyte plate. However, from a      practical point of view, the thickness of the glass dome and the thickness      of the porous inorganic material packing layer and the thickness of the      solid electrolyte plate are generally in the ranges of from 5 to 30 .mu.m,      from 5 to 20 .mu.m and from 0.1 to 1 mm, respectively. The thickness of      the solid electrolyte plate is preferably in the range of from 0.1 to 0.4      mm. In the case of the oxygen sensor device having a porous inorganic      material semi-packing layer, the thickness of the vacant portion of the      diffusion chamber has no particular limitation, but is generally in the      range of from 1 to 5 .mu.m. When the gas inlet means is provided in the      solid electrolyte plate, the diameter of the gas inlet means is generally      in the range of from 10 to 100 .mu.m. When the gas inlet means is provided      in the glass dome, the diameter of the gas inlet means is preferably in      the range of from 30 to 100 .mu.m. </PAR><PAR>  With respect to the shape of the glass dome, there is also no limitation.      Although the shape of semi-circle in cross-section is shown herein, any      other shapes including rectangular shape can be used. </PAR><PAR>  The type of glass for forming the glass dome is not critical.

The glass to be used for forming the glass dome of the oxygen      sensor device of the present invention can be selected from either of the      above-mentioned two different types. Types A, D and E shown in Table 1 are      crystallizable. On the other hand, types B and C are non-crystallizable. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, if desired, the glass dome may be formed of a      plurality of glass layers. As described later, from the viewpoint of power      consumption saving, the glass dome preferably has a double layer structure      formed of a glass layer of high electrically insulating properties, such      as one made of crystallized glass, and a glass layer of high sealing      properties, such as one made of non-crystallized glass. </PAR><PAR>  The porous inorganic material packing layer mentioned before is formed of      an antifire material which does not melt at the temperature used for      forming the glass dome. Representative examples of antifire materials are      ceramics (e.g., aluminum oxide, zirconia, calcium oxide, silicon carbide,      silicone nitride, spinel, silica, magnesia, mullite) and metals (e.g.,      iron, nickel, chrome, manganese). The proportion of the volume of the void      portion to the entire volume of the diffusion chamber is generally about      20% or higher. </PAR><PAR>  In general, the volume of the diffusion chamber should be as small as      possible. The ambient pressure often suffers from sharp increase due to      the change of climate, occurrence of bursting of steam, operation of an      air conditioner and the like. If the volume of the diffusion chamber is      too large and the ambient pressure outside the diffusion chamber is      sharply increased, a large amount of ambient gas flows into the diffusion      chamber, resulting in a sharp increase in the electric current. The sharp      increase in the electric current impairs the functional stability of the      sensor device. From this viewpoint, it is preferred that a porous      inorganic material packing layer be disposed in the diffusion chamber. On      the other hand, the contact area of the electrode on the side of the      diffusion chamber with an ambient gas should be as large as possible from      the viewpoint of causing the electrode to exert full performance.      Accordingly, it is more preferred that a porous inorganic material      semi-packing layer be fixedly disposed in an upper portion of the      diffusion chamber, while leaving vacant the remainder of the diffusion      chamber. </PAR><PAR>  The oxygen sensor device of the present invention may be provided with a      heater means for applying heat to the solid electrolyte plate. When the      oxygen sensor device of the present invention is not provided with a      heater means, an external heater may be employed for facilitating the      energization of the solid electrolyte plate. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the glass dome or the solid electrolyte plate has      a gas inlet means for diffusing ambient gas into the diffusion chamber.      The method for providing a gas inlet means is not critical. A gas inlet      means may be provided by forming cracks in the glass dome as shown in      FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. In the oxygen sensor device of FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, glass      dome 4 has fine cracks 5. Fine cracks 5 can be formed in glass dome 4 by      applying heat shock thereto once or twice. </PAR><PAR>  In the oxygen sensor device of FIG. 3, glass dome 4 has fine cracks and      porous inorganic material packing layer 3A is fixedly disposed in the      entire space of the diffusion chamber defined by glass dome and solid      electrolyte plate 1. </PAR><PAR>  A gas inlet means may alternatively be provided in the glass dome by      planting a capillary in the glass dome as shown in FIG. 5. In FIG. 5, the      gas inlet means is capillary 8 planted in glass dome 4. In the embodiment      of FIG. 5, porous inorganic material packing layer 3A is provided on the      opposite side of solid electrolyte plate 1. Heater means 9 is      advantageously provided directly on layer 3A. Layer 3A shown in FIG. 5 has      no glass dome thereon, however, a glass dome may be formed on layer 3A. In      the case of the latter, a gas outlet means is necessarily formed in the      glass dome. </PAR><PAR>  As described later, the oxygen sensor device may preferably be produced by      a method comprising the steps of (1) providing an oxygen conductive solid      electrolyte plate having electrodes and electric lead means disposed      thereon, (2) forming a burnable material layer, a porous antifire      inorganic material layer or a composite layer of burnable material and      antifire inorganic material on the electrolyte plate, (3) coating a      powdery glass-containing pasty material on the layer to form a      glass-containing layer, and (4) firing the resultant coated plate. </PAR><PAR>  When a capillary is planted in the glass dome, the capillary may simply be      planted in the glass dome after step (3) but before step (4). However,      when a porous inorganic material packing layer or a porous inorganic      material semi-packing layer is employed, the planting of a capillary in      the glass dome is likely to cause a pasty material to enter the hollow of      the capillary, thereby bringing about the problem of clogging. In order to      inhibit the entering of the pasty material into the capillary, the end      portion of the capillary may be sealed with an organic material (e.g.,      epoxy resin, polyimide resin, polyamide resin and polystyrene resin). For      sealing the end portion of the capillary, the organic material may be      coated on the end portion of the capillary. When the organic material is      in a powdery form, the material may be filled into the hollow end portion      of the capillary. When firing is performed for formation of the glass      dome, the organic material is burnt off to leave open the end portion of      capillary 8 while forming a small vacant portion. Such a small vacant      portion can also be formed around an aperture formed in the solid      electrolyte plate in the similar manner as later described with reference      to FIGS. 11(A) and 11(B). The vacant portion formed around the open end      portion is effective for promotion of the diffusion of ambient gas into      the diffusion chamber. The organic material is required to burn at a      temperature higher than the calcination temperature (about 600.degree. C.)      for an inorganic material (such as alumina), but lower than the      calcination temperature for glass (about 900.degree. to 1000.degree. C.). </PAR><PAR>  Still further, a gas inlet means may be provided in the glass dome by      creating an orifice by means of a substance capable of foaming. For      example, a gas inlet means is formed in the glass dome by embedding in a      glass-containing layer a microsphere of a mixture of a powdery      glass-containing pasty material and a substance capable of foaming at the      melting temperature of the powdery glass, before the firing, followed by      firing to obtain a glass dome having an orifice. Embedding may be      performed by using a needle or the like. The mixture may be obtained by      mixing the glass material with 1 to 50% by weight of a substance capable      of foaming at the melting temperature of the powdery glass, such as sodium      nitrite. </PAR><PAR>  Still further, a gas inlet means may be provided in the glass dome by      planting in the glass-containing layer a fiber capable of melting or      burning at the melting temperature of the powdery glass, followed by      firing to obtain a glass dome having an orifice. The fiber may be made of      aluminum, magnesium or the like. The fiber may simply be planted in the      powdery glass-containing material so that it reaches the burnable material      layer or the antifire material layer. The inner end portion of the fiber      may optionally be coated with an organic material in the same manner as in      the case of the capillary. When firing is performed, the fiber is melted      or burnt to form an orifice, and the organic material is burnt off to      leave a vacant portion around the inner end portion of the orifice. As      described before, the vacant portion is effective for facilitating the      diffusion of ambient gas into the diffusion chamber. </PAR><PAR>  One preferred form of an oxygen sensor device is shown in FIG. 6, which has      a solid electrolyte plate provided with a gas inlet means. In FIG. 6,      numeral 1 designates an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate having a      predetermined oxygen ion conductivity upon the energization of the      electrolyte, and numerals 2A and 2B designate a first electrode and a      second electrode which are porous and made of, for example, platinum and      which are respectively disposed on the upper surface and the lower surface      of solid electrolyte plate 1. Numeral 7 designates an aperture as a gas      inlet means formed in solid electrolyte plate 1, and numeral 3A designates      a porous antifire inorganic material packing layer which is formed over      first electrode 2A on the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate 1.      Numeral 4 designates a glass dome which is formed over the entire surface      of porous antifire inorganic material packing layer 3A, and numerals 6A      and 6B designate a first electric lead means and a second electric lead      means respectively for connecting first electrode 2A and second electrode      2B to power source means. </PAR><PAR>  In an oxygen sensor device having a solid electrolyte plate having a gas      inlet means, the oxygen sensor device may preferably have a structure such      that the gas inlet means is not blocked with a porous antifire inorganic      material packing layer. One preferred form of an oxygen sensor device      having the above-mentioned structure is shown in FIG. 11(B). For example,      the device may be obtained as follows. As is shown in FIG. 11(A), a pasty      material containing a powdery metal is coated by screen printing on the      upper surface a the lower surface of solid electrolyte plate 1 having      aperture 7 and fired to form first electrode 2A and second electrode 2B      each made of the metal. Representative examples of powdery metals include      powdery platinum, powdery palladium, powdery silver and a mixture thereof.      Of these, powdery platinum is preferred. Then, the inner end of aperture 7      is blocked by coating pasty burnable organic material 10 thereon or      blocked by placing powdery burnable organic material 10 thereon.      Thereafter, a pasty material containing an antifire inorganic material,      such as a powdery alumina, is coated over the upper surface of solid      electrolyte plate 1 having first electrode 2A thereon, and then fired to      form porous antifire inorganic material packing layer 3A. A powdery      glass-containing pasty material is coated on the entire surface of the      porous antifire inorganic material packing layer 3A and then fired to form      glass dome 4, thereby providing a diffusion chamber defined by solid      electrolyte plate 1 and glass dome 4 and filled by packing layer 3A.      During the firing of the powdery glass-containing pasty material, organic      material 10 is burnt off. As a result, as shown in FIG. 11(B), vacant      portion 11 is formed around the inner end of aperture 7 where organic      material 10 has been present, and the inner end of aperture 7 as a gas      inlet means fully opens to a diffusion chamber, thereby enabling pumping      of oxygen to be efficiently performed as shown by arrows. </PAR><PAR>  The method for producing an oxygen sensor device of the present invention      is not limited to the above but various methods can be employed to obtain      various forms of the oxygen sensor device as described hereinbelow. </PAR><PAR>  One form of an oxygen sensor device of the present invention can be      produced by method (I) comprising the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (1) providing an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate having a first      electrode and a second electrode respectively disposed on the upper      surface and the lower surface of the solid electrolyte plate and having a      first electric lead means and a second electric lead means respectively      for connecting the first and second electrodes to power source means, the      solid electrolyte plate having a gas inlet means or having no gas inlet      means; </PAR><PAR>  (2) forming a burnable material layer on at least one of the upper and      lower surfaces of the solid electrolyte plate; </PAR><PAR>  (3) coating a powdery glass-containing pasty material on the entire surface      of the burnable material layer to form a glass-containing layer; and </PAR><PAR>  (4) firing the resultant coated plate having the burnable material layer      disposed between the glass-containing layer and the solid electrolyte      plate, thereby forming a glass dome fluid-tightly connected at its      circumferential edge to at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of      the solid electrolyte plate, the glass dome defining a vacant diffusion      chamber in cooperation with the solid electrolyte plate; </PAR><PAR>  wherein, when the electrolyte plate has no gas inlet means, a gas inlet      means is formed in the glass dome simultaneously with or after the firing      for formation of the glass dome. </PAR><PAR>  The above-mentioned method is specifically described with reference to      FIGS. 7(A) to 7(D). </PAR><PAR>  For example, a powdery zirconia containing 8% by mole of a powdery Y.sub.2      O.sub.3 is incorporated in a rubber tube. In this instance, a yarn made      of, for example, a polyester fiber, such as Tetron.RTM. or carbon fiber      longitudinally extends under tension through the center line of the rubber      tube. The powdery zirconia with the yarn passing therethrough is      compressed under a pressure of, for example, about 1000 kg/cm.sup.2. The      compressed zirconia is taken out of the rubber tube and fired at      1600.degree. C. for 3 hours to obtain a rod-shaped fired zirconia product      having an aperture passing therethrough. The rod-shaped fired zirconia      product is sliced in a perpendicular direction to the aperture to obtain a      slice having an aperture running through the slice from one surface      thereof to the other surface thereof. The slice with the aperture      constitutes solid electrolyte plate 1 with gas inlet means 7. On each      surface of the slice as solid electrolyte plate 1 is coated by screen      printing a pasty material containing a powdery metal prepared in      substantially the same manner as in the preparation of a powdery      glass-containing pasty material except that a powdery metal having a      diameter of from 0.1 .mu.m to several hundreds of microns (.mu.m),      preferably from 0.1 to 10 .mu.m, is used instead of a powdery glass.      Representative examples of powdery metals include powdery platinum,      powdery palladium, powdery silver and a mixture thereof. Of these, powdery      platinum is preferred. The resultant plate is fired at about 1000.degree.      C. for about 30 minutes to obtain solid electrolyte plate 1 having gas      inlet means 7 and having first electrode 2A on its upper surface and      second electrode 2B on its lower surface. The thus obtained solid      electrolyte plate 1 is shown FIG. 7(A). Then, as shown in FIG. 7(B), a      pasty material containing a burnable material, such as aluminum powder,      magnesium powder, a burnable synthetic resin, carbon or graphite, is      coated by screen printing on the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate      1 having first electrode 2A thereon to form burnable material layer 3A.      Representative examples of synthetic resins include a polyimide resin, a      polyamide resin, a polyester resin and an epoxy resin. During the course      of the screen printing, gas inlet means 7 is generally clogged with the      pasty material containing a burnable material as shown FIG. 7(B). However,      it sometimes occurs that gas inlet means 7 is not clogged with the pasty      material containing a burnable material, because the diameter of gas inlet      means 7 is as small as from about 20 to about 30 .mu.m. Whichever occurs,      the consequence is the same, because the pasty material is burnt off or      vaporized during the firing described below. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 7(C), a powdery glass-containing pasty      material is coated on burnable material layer 3A by screen printing to      form glass-containing layer 4 completely covering burnable material layer      3A. The pasty material may be prepared for example by mixing a powdery      glass having a diameter of 0.1 to 20 .mu.m with a mixture of butylcarbitol      acetate and nitrocellulose in proportions such that the weight ratio of      the powdery glass to the solvent is 1:1 to form glass-containing layer 4      completely covering antifire inorganic material layer 3A. Representative      examples of powdery glasses include glasses shown in Table 1 shown above.      Such glasses generally have a thermal expansion coefficient of from      70.times.10.sup.-7 to 130.times.10.sup.-7 /.degree. C. Specific examples      of glasses having a thermal expansion coefficient of from      70.times.10.sup.-7 to 130.times.10.sup.-7 /.degree. C. include crystalline      glass AP5710 (produced and sold by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd., Japan). It is      preferred that glass dome 4 have a thermal expansion coefficient close to      that of solid electrolyte plate 1. However, it is not always necessary      that the thermal expansion coefficient of glass dome 4 be equal to that of      solid electrolyte plate 1. For example, the thermal expansion coefficient      of glass dome 4 is generally in the range of 70.times.10.sup.-7 to      130.times.10.sup.-7 /.degree. C. and the thermal expansion coefficient of      solid electrolyte plate 1 is generally in the range of 95.times.10.sup.-7      to 100.times.10.sup.-7 /.degree. C. The resultant composite may be      subjected to provisional firing for drying, followed by final firing.      Alternatively, the resultant composite may directly be subjected to final      firing without provisional firing. The final firing is performed, for      example, in a furnace at 600.degree. to 1000.degree. C. for about 30      minutes so that glass-containing layer 4 is converted into a glass layer      andlsqb;shown in FIG. 7(D) as glass dome 4andrsqb;fluid-tightly connected at its      circumferential base edge to the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate      1. As a result, as shown FIG. 7(D), glass dome 4 defining diffusion      chamber 3 in cooperation with solid electrolyte plate 1 having aperture 7,      is formed. </PAR><PAR>  An oxygen sensor device comprising a porous inorganic material packing      layer which is fixedly disposed in the entire space of a diffusion chamber      defined by an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate provided with a      pair of electrodes and a glass dome can efficiently be produced by, for      example, the following method (II). </PAR><PAR>  Method (II) comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (1) providing an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate having a first      electrode and a second electrode respectively disposed on the upper      surface and the lower surface of the solid electrolyte plate and having a      first electric lead means and a second electric lead means respectively      for connecting the first and second electrodes to power source means, the      solid electrolyte plate having a gas inlet means or having no gas inlet      means; </PAR><PAR>  (2) forming a porous antifire inorganic material layer on at least one of      the upper and lower surfaces of the solid electrolyte plate; </PAR><PAR>  (3) coating a powdery glass-containing pasty material on the entire surface      of the antifire material layer to form a glass-containing layer; and </PAR><PAR>  (4) firing the resultant coated plate having the porous antifire inorganic      material layer disposed between the glass-containing layer and the solid      electrolyte plate, thereby forming a glass dome fluid-tightly connected at      its circumferential base edge to the upper surface of the solid      electrolyte plate, the glass dome defining in cooperation with the solid      electrolyte plate a diffusion chamber having a porous antifire inorganic      material packing layer fixedly disposed in the entire space of the      diffusion chamber; </PAR><PAR>  wherein, when the electrolyte plate has no gas inlet means, a gas inlet      means is provided in the glass dome simultaneously with or after the      firing for formation of the glass dome. </PAR><PAR>  The above-mentioned method is specifically described with reference to      FIGS. 7(A) to 7(C). </PAR><PAR>  Substantially the same procedure as in method (I) is repeated to obtain      solid electrolyte plate 1 having gas inlet means 7 and having first      electrode 2A on its upper surface and second electrode 2B on its lower      surface. The thus obtained solid electrolyte plate 1 is shown in FIG.      7(A). Then, a powder of an antifire inorganic material, for example, a      ceramic, such as alumina or zirconia, or a metal, such as titanium or      iron, is mixed with a solvent, such as water, an alcohol,      .alpha.-terpineol or the like to obtain a pasty material containing an      antifire inorganic material. As shown in FIG. 7(B), the pasty material      containing an antifire inorganic material is coated by screen printing on      the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate 1 having first electrode 2A      thereon to form antifire inorganic material layer 3A. The resultant      composite is fired at about 1000.degree. C. or dried. Then, coating of a      powdery glass-containing pasty material and firing are performed in      substantially the same manner as in method (I). As a result, the desired      oxygen sensor device having a porous antifire inorganic material packing      layer disposed in the entire inner space of the glass dome is obtained. </PAR><PAR>  An oxygen sensor device comprising a porous inorganic material semi-packing      layer which is fixedly disposed in an upper portion of a diffusion chamber      which portion is remote from a solid electrolyte plate, while leaving      vacant the remainder of a diffusion chamber defined by the solid      electrolyte plate, which is provided with a pair of electrodes, and a      glass dome, can be efficiently produced by, for example, the following      method (III). </PAR><PAR>  Method (III) comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (1) providing an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate having a first      electrode and a second electrode respectively disposed on the upper      surface and the lower surface of the solid electrolyte plate and having a      first electric lead means and a second electric lead means respectively      for connecting the first and second electrodes to power source means the      solid electrolyte plate having a gas inlet means or having no gas inlet      means; </PAR><PAR>  (2) forming a burnable material layer on at least one of the upper and      lower surfaces of the solid electrolyte plate; </PAR><PAR>  (3) forming a porous antifire inorganic material layer on the burnable      material layer; </PAR><PAR>  (4) coating a powdery glass-containing pasty material on the entire surface      of the antifire material layer to form a glass-containing layer; and </PAR><PAR>  (5) firing the resultant coated plate having the burnable material layer      and the porous antifire inorganic material layer disposed thereon between      the glass-containing layer and the solid electrolyte plate, thereby      forming a glass dome fluid-tightly connected at its circumferential base      edge to the upper surface of the solid electrolyte plate, the glass dome      defining in cooperation with the solid electrolyte plate a diffusion      chamber having a porous antifire inorganic material semi-packing layer      fixedly disposed in an upper portion of the diffusion chamber which upper      portion is remote from the solid electrolyte plate, while leaving vacant      the remainder of the diffusion chamber; </PAR><PAR>  wherein, when the electrolyte plate has no gas inlet means, a gas inlet      means is formed in the glass dome simultaneously with or after the firing      for formation of the glass dome. </PAR><PAR>  The above-mentioned method is specifically described with reference to FIG.      4. </PAR><PAR>  Substantially the same procedure as in method (I) is repeated to obtain      solid electrolyte plate 1 having first electrode 2A on its upper surface      and second electrode 2B on its lower surface. Then, a burnable material      layer is formed in a predetermined thickness in substantially the same      manner as in method (I). Thereafter, on the burnable material layer is      coated by screen printing a pasty material containing an antifire      inorganic material as used in method (II) in a predetermined thickness to      form an antifire material layer 3B completely covering the burnable      material layer. The resultant composite is fired at about 1000.degree. C.      or dried. On the resultant composite is coated by screen printing a      powdery glass-containing pasty material as used in method (I) to form a      glass-containing layer 4 completely covering the antifire inorganic      material layer 3B. The resultant composite is fired at 600.degree. to      1000.degree. C. for about 30 minutes to form glass dome 4 fluid-tightly      connected at its circumferential base edge to the upper surface of solid      electrolyte plate 1, thereby forming a diffusion chamber defined by solid      electrolyte plate 1 and glass dome 4. </PAR><PAR>  In the firing, the burnable material layer is burnt while supporting      antifire inorganic material layer 3B until antifire inorganic material      layer 3B becomes firm and porous. The burnable material layer is finally      burnt off. As a result, there is provided porous inorganic material      semi-packing layer 3B which is fixedly disposed in an upper portion of the      diffusion chamber which portion is remote from solid electrolyte plate 1,      while leaving vacant the remainder of the diffusion chamber. When the      burnable material is relatively slowly burnable material, antifire      inorganic material layer is firmly supported by the burnable material      layer. Therefore, it is preferred to use a relatively slowly burnable      material. Representative examples of relatively slowly burnable materials      include carbon and graphite. </PAR><PAR>  The above description is made with respect to the oxygen sensor device      having a gas inlet means in an oxygen conductive solid electrolyte plate.      Of course, an oxygen sensor device having a gas inlet means in a glass      dome can be produced by simply changing the manner of providing a gas      inlet means. The method for providing the glass dome with a gas inlet      means is as described hereinbefore. </PAR><PAR>  As mentioned before, it is preferred that an oxygen sensor device be      provided with a heater means having a third electric lead means and a      fourth electric lead means respectively for connecting the heater means to      power source means. A heater means may be provided inside or outside the      diffusion chamber. For example, a heater means may be disposed on the      inner wall surface or on the outer wall surface of a glass dome. When a      heater means is provided inside the diffusion chamber, it is preferred      that an oxygen sensor device further comprise an electrically insulating      porous glass layer provided between the heater means and the first      electrode disposed on the upper surface of the solid electrolyte plate.      When a heater means is disposed on the inner wall surface or the outer      wall surface of the glass dome, the glass dome is required to have      sufficient electrically insulating properties for preventing electrical      leak from the heater means. The prevention of electrical leak from the      heater means contributes to not only high performance of the oxygen sensor      device but also energy saving. On the other hand, it is preferred from the      viewpoint of attaining high accuracy of an oxygen sensor device that the      glass dome have good sealing properties. Therefore, when a heater is      disposed on the inner wall surface or the outer wall surface of a glass      dome, it is desired for the glass dome to have both sufficient      electrically insulating properties and good sealing properties. If a glass      dome comprising a single glass layer does not have both sufficient      electrically insulating properties and good sealing properties, it is      preferred to use a glass dome having a double layer structure, i.e., a      glass dome comprising a glass layer of high electrically insulating      properties and a glass layer of high sealing properties. When a glass dome      having a double layer structure is used, a heater is disposed on the      surface of the glass layer of high electrically insulating properties.      That is, the glass layer of high electrically insulating properties is in      contact on one side thereof with the glass layer of high sealing      properties and on the other side thereof with the heater means. </PAR><PAR>  The method for disposing a heater means is not critical. For example, a      heater means can be disposed on the outer wall surface of a glass dome      according to the following method which is described with reference to      FIG. 8. On glass dome 4 of an oxygen sensor device is coated by screen      printing, dipping or spraying a pasty material containing a powdery metal,      which is prepared in substantially the same manner as in the preparation      of the powdery glass-containing pasty material, except that a powdery      metal is used instead of a powdery glass. Representative examples of      powdery metals include powdery platinum, powdery palladium, powdery silver      and a mixture thereof. Of these, powdery platinum is preferred. Then, the      coated glass dome is fired to obtain an oxygen sensor device provided with      heater means 9 on its outer wall surface of glass dome 4. </PAR><PAR>  Further, a heater means can be disposed on the inner wall surface of a      glass dome according to the following method which is described with      reference to FIG. 9. On the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate 1      having gas inlet means 7 and having first electrode 2A on its upper      surface and second electrode 2B on its lower surface is coated by screen      printing, dipping or spraying a pasty material containing an antifire      inorganic material, e.g., alumina or zirconia, to form antifire inorganic      material layer 3A. Antifire inorganic material layer 3A is dried, and the      above-mentioned pasty material containing a powdery metal for forming      heater means is coated thereon by screen printing, dipping or spraying,      and fired. Then, a powdery glass-containing pasty material is coated, and      fired. As a result, an oxygen sensor device having heater means 9 disposed      on the inner wall surface of glass dome 4 as shown in FIG. 9 is obtained. </PAR><PAR>  Subsequently, a powdery platinum-containing pasty material is coated on the      surface of the above-mentioned porous antifire inorganic material layer 3A      formed on the upper surface of solid electrolyte plate 1, followed by      drying to form a platinum layer. The coating of a powdery      platinum-containing pasty material may be conducted by printing or      spraying the pasty material. Alternatively, the coating of the pasty      material may be conducted by dipping the surface of the porous antifire      inorganic material layer 3A in the pasty material. On the entire surface      of the resultant platinum layer, a powdery crystallizable glass-containing      pasty material is coated by printing, dipping, spraying or the like in the      manner as mentioned above. The resultant ion conductive plate comprising      the solid electrolyte plate and, coated thereon, the inorganic material      layer, the platinum layer and the glass-containing layer is fired so that      the platinum layer is sintered to form heater means 9 bonded to the      surface of inorganic material layer 3A, and the crystallizable glass of      the glass-containing layer is simultaneously crystallized to form a glass      layer in the form of glass dome 4. Thus, an oxygen sensor device which has      a heater means disposed on the inner wall surface of the glass dome is      obtained. When a heater means is provided on the inside of a glass dome,      it is preferred that an electrically insulating porous glass layer be      provided between the heater means and the first electrode disposed on the      upper surface of the solid electrolyte plate. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, the first electrode, namely the      electrode provided on the upper surface of a solid electrolyte plate on      the side of a diffusion chamber defined by the glass dome and the solid      electrolyte plate, may be disposed completely within the glass dome. In      this case, the electric lead means needs to be drawn out of the diffusion      chamber. This drawing can be done simultaneously with the formation of a      glass dome Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 10, the first electrode may be      provided such that a portion of the first electrode protrudes outside the      glass dome. </PAR><PAR>  In order to prevent breakage of an electric lead means connecting an      electrode or a heater means to power source means by shock, impact, etc.,      and in order to fix the oxygen sensor device easily to a support plate or      the like as will be explained later, an oxygen sensor device may further      comprise an electrically insulating leg member having attached at its one      end portion to the outer surface of the glass dome or the outer surface of      the solid electrolyte plate through an adhesive layer, while leaving      unattached the remaining elongate portion A couple of the first and second      electric lead means and a couple of the third and fourth electric lead      means each extend on and along the unattached elongate portion of the leg      member, and the gas inlet means and the leg member satisfy a positional      relationship such that a passage is provided for diffusing ambient gas      into the diffusion chamber through the gas inlet means. The adhesive layer      is non-porous or porous in accordance with the position of the gas inlet      means relative to the leg member so that a passage is provided for passing      the oxygen pumped out of the diffusion chamber through the solid      electrolyte plate to ambient atmosphere. Such a device can advantageously      be connected to the connector means of power source means by simple      engagement of the end portion of the leg member with the connector means,      to provide connections between the electric lead means and the power      source means, which are unlikely to easily be broken </PAR><PAR>  The solid electrolyte plate and the heater means may be provided on the      same surface of the leg member. Alternatively, the solid electrolyte plate      and the heater means may be separately provided on both surfaces of the      leg member, respectively </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 12(A), (B) and (C), one form of the oxygen sensor device      of the present invention comprising a leg member attached to the outer      surface of the glass dome through an adhesive layer and in which the gas      inlet means is provided in the solid electrolyte plate is explained below.      A thin solid electrolyte plate 1 may be made of, for example, a stabilized      zirconia (e.g., ZrO.sub.2 -8Y.sub.2 O.sub.3), having an ionic      conductivity. First and second electrodes 2A and 2B are disposed      respectively on the lower surface and the upper surface of the solid      electrolyte plate. Porous inorganic material packing layer 3A and glass      dome 4 are provided on the lower side of the solid electrolyte plate.      Solid electrolyte plate 1 has gas inlet means 7 at its center portion and      electrodes 2A and 2B have through-hole 2C at their center portion so that      ambient gas can be introduced into the diffusion chamber defined by solid      electrolyte plate 1 and glass dome 4 through gas inlet means 7 and      through-hole 2C. The diameter of the through-hole of the electrode may      generally be larger than that of gas inlet means 7. Gas inlet means 7      controls the introduction of ambient gas into the diffusion chamber      defined by glass dome 4 and solid electrolyte plate 1 so that the      diffusion rate of a gas into the diffusion chamber is controlled. Solid      electrolyte plate 1, electrodes 2A and 2B, porous inorganic material layer      3A and glass dome 4 constitute composite 14. An end portion of the      electrode disposed in the diffusion chamber protrudes out of the glass      dome. To the electrodes, a predetermined electric voltage (for example,      about 2 V) is applied. On the outer surface of solid electrolyte plate 1      (lower side in FIG. 12(A)), heater means 9 is provided to heat solid      electrolyte plate 1. </PAR><PAR>  Porous inorganic material packing layer 3A is composed of porous sintered      material, such as an alumina powder, which is provided so as to cover      first electrode 2A completely, and glass dome 4 is provided so as to cover      porous sintered material 3A completely. At the center portion of solid      electrolyte plate 4, gas inlet means 7 is provided. In this embodiment,      the gas inlet means is an aperture running through solid electrolyte plate      1 from one surface thereof to the other surface thereof Ambient gas      containing oxygen can be introduced into the diffusion chamber defined by      glass dome 4 and solid electrolyte plate 1 through aperture 7. The gas      inlet means is not limited to that shown in FIG. 12. The gas inlet means      may alternatively be provided in glass dome 4 as mentioned hereinbefore. </PAR><PAR>  In a portion of solid electrolyte plate 1 which is positioned between two      electrodes 2A and 2B, a current of oxygen ions is flowed when ambient gas      containing oxygen is introduced into the diffusion chamber through gas      inlet means 7 and the oxygen is contacted with electrode 2A, so that the      oxygen pumped out of the diffusion chamber through the solid electrolyte      plate to ambient atmosphere as shown by arrows. By the ionic current, an      electric current is caused to flow between the first and second electrodes      2A and 2B. Based on the electric current produced by the ionic current,      the partial pressure of oxygen in the ambient gas is determined. </PAR><PAR>  Leg member 15 may generally be made of a material having a thermal      expansion coefficient almost equal to that of solid electrolyte plate 1.      Examples of materials for leg member 15 include ZrO.sub.2 -3Y.sub.2      O.sub.3, Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 (alumina), forsterite and the like. When the      substrate material of leg member 15 is electrically conductive, an alumina      powder or a crystallizable glass is coated on the overall surface of leg      member 15 by sinter-coating to form an electrically insulating layer.      Composite 14 is attached at one end portion on upper surface 15A of leg      member 15 by means of adhesive layer 16, and heater means 9 is attached at      the same end portion of leg member 15 at its lower surface by printing or      plating. When the leg member made of alumina or forsterite is used, it is      not necessary to form an electrically insulating layer on the surface      thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Adhesive layer 16 is formed by sinter-coating an adhesive at 500.degree. to      1000.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the adhesive layer may be non-porous or porous in      accordance with the position of the gas inlet means relative to the leg      member so that a passage is provided for passing the oxygen pumped out of      the diffusion chamber through the solid electrolyte plate to ambient      atmosphere. For example, when gas inlet means 7 is provided in solid      electrolyte plate 1 and leg member 15 is disposed on the outer surface of      solid electrolyte plate 1 as shown in FIG. 13, it is necessary that      adhesive layer 16 be porous. On the other hand, when gas inlet means is      provided in solid electrolyte plate 1 and leg member 15 is disposed on the      outer surface of glass dome 4 as shown in FIG. 12(A), adhesive layer 16      may be either non-porous or porous. However, a porous adhesive layer is      advantageous in that the distortion due to the difference in thermal      expansion coefficient between glass dome 4 and leg member 15 or between      solid electrolyte plate 1 and leg member 15 can be diminished. Therefore,      a porous adhesive layer may generally be used. Examples of adhesives      include a ceramic type adhesive containing an alkali ion, a mixture of      alumina powder with glass, metal paste and the like. When solid      electrolyte plate 1 has almost the same thermal expansion coefficient as      that of leg member 15, a glass having a thermal expansion coefficient      which is almost equal to that of solid electrolyte plate 1 or leg member      15 may also be used as an adhesive. The adhesive may be spotwise coated on      the outer surface of glass dome 4 or solid electrolyte plate 1.      Alternatively, the adhesive may be coated broadly on the outer surface of      glass dome 4 or solid electrolyte plate 1. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of FIGS. 12(A) to 12(C), electric lead means 6A and 6B      respectively connected to electrodes 2A and 2B are disposed on upper      surface 15A of leg member 15, whereas electric lead means 9A and 9B      respectively connected to heater means 9 are disposed on lower surface 15B      of leg member 15. </PAR><PAR>  These electric lead means 6A, 6B, 9A and 9B may be formed by bonding wires      or by printing an electrically conductive pasty material, followed by      sinter-coating. In FIGS. 12(A), (B) and (C), each of a couple of electric      lead means 6A and 6B connected to electrodes 2A and 2B, and a couple of      electric lead means 9A and 9B connected to heater means 9 is formed of a      pair of parallely running conductive platinum coatings formed on leg      member 15 as shown in FIGS. 12(B) and (C). </PAR><PAR>  If desired, neck portion 17 may be as depicted in FIGS. 12(B) and 12(C), so      that escape of heat generated by heater means 9 is suppressed. </PAR><PAR>  For not only preventing escape of heat generated by heater means 9, but      also attaining uniform heat distribution on solid electrolyte plate 1,      neck portion 17 of each of electric lead means 9A and 9B connected to      heater means 9 is effective, because heat is generated in neck portion 17      of electric lead means 9A and 9B. </PAR><PAR>  In the oxygen sensor device as shown in FIG. 12, the outer surface of glass      dome 4 is attached to leg member 15 through adhesive layer 16. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, however, various configurations can be employed. For      example, as shown in FIG. 13, the outer surface of solid electrolyte plate      1 which is opposite to the side on which glass dome 4 is formed, may      alternatively be attached to leg member 15 through porous adhesive layer      16. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of FIG. 13, each of leg member 15 and adhesive layer has      through-hole 18 communicating with aperture 7 of solid electrolyte plate      1. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 14, the oxygen sensor device of the present invention may      be secured on a conventional support plate 21 and covered with netted cap      24. In FIG. 14, four pins 22a, 22b, 22c and 22d are fluid-tightly, fixedly      planted on discoid support plate 21. Pins 22a and 22c are connected to      electric lead means 23a and 23c, respectively, which in turn are connected      to two electrodes 2A and 2B (not shown), respectively. Pins 22b and 22d      are connected to electric lead means 23b and 23d, respectively, which in      turn are connected to both ends of heater means 20, respectively. Electric      lead means 23a, 23b, 23c, and 23d may generally be a gold string or a      platinum string having a diameter of about 0.1 mm. Oxygen sensor device 19      is suspended in midair by means of four electric lead means 23a, 23b, 23c      and 23d, and is wrapped by, for example, a bulk of a fibrous soft      substance (not shown) and covered with netted cap 24. However, the      structure shown in FIG. 14 has a disadvantage in that when the device      receives a shock or impact, the electric lead means occasionally cannot      resist the weight of the device so that the electric lead means are      broken. Further, the fluid-tight connection between each of pins 22a, 22b,      22c and 22d and support plate is likely to be damaged by shock or impact.      When the support plate is set on the wall of a chamber such that the      oxygen sensor device on the support plate faces the space of the chamber      and the opposite side of the support plate faces the outside of the      chamber, and a gap is formed between each pin and support plate by the      damage of the fluid-tight connection therebetween which is caused by shock      or impact, a gas is introduced from the outside of the chamber into the      chamber through the gap so that the partial pressure of the oxygen in the      original ambient gas in the chamber no longer can be measured accurately.      Further, if the ambient gas in the chamber is harmful, there is a danger      that such a harmful gas leaks out of the chamber through the gap. Further,      it takes much time for connecting electric lead means to pins, leading to      a increase in production cost. </PAR><PAR>  The above-mentioned problems can be overcome by fluid-tightly, fixedly      inserting the unattached elongate portion of the leg member in the slit of      a support plate together with both the couples of electric lead means so      that a predetermined length of the elongate portion is protruded, together      with the corresponding lengths of both the couples of electric lead means,      through the support plate, and covering, with a gas permeable cap, an      assembly of the glass dome, the solid electrolyte plate having the first      and second electrodes and a portion of the leg member with the      corresponding lengths of both the couples of electric lead means, which      assembly is positioned above the support plate on the side of the gas      permeable cap, leaving a space between the gas permeable cap and the      assembly, as shown in FIG. 15(A). The gas permeable cap is fluid-tightly      fixed at its circumferential base edge to the upper surface of the support      plate. The protruded elongate portion of the leg member is adapted to be      connected to a connector means of the power source means. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 15(A) and (B), support plate 27 is made of a ceramic and      has, at its center portion, slit 27A for inserting the substrate plate      together with both the couples of electric lead means thereinto. Support      plate 27 also has, on its surface, groove 26A for receiving and fixing a      gas permeable cap thereto. Support plate 27 further has through-holes 29      which are used for fixing the support plate 27 on a wall etc. by means of      a bolt and nut or the like. Further, support plate 27 also has connection      aid member 30 useful in engaging the free end of the leg member with the      connector means of power source means. The assembly is inserted in slit      27A of support plate 27 so that a predetermined length of the elongate      portion is protruded together with both the couples of electric lead means      through the support plate and fluid-tightly fixed by means of sealing      means 28. The gas permeable cap 26 is fluid-tightly fixed at its      circumferential base edge to groove 26A by means of sealing means 28. The      type of the sealing means is not specifically limited. Generally, a glass      may be used. Gas permeable cap 26 may generally be made of a ceramic and      porous. The protruded elongate portion of the leg member is adapted to be      connected to a connector means of a power source means. The connection may      be conducted simply by inserting it in a female connector with the aid of      connection aid member 30. Alternatively, the protruded end portion may be      connected to a connector by soldering or ultrasonic welding. Ambient gas      containing oxygen is introduced into the inner space of gas permeable cap      26 through pores of gas permeable cap 26, and the partial pressure of the      oxygen in the ambient gas is measured by the assembly. The above-mentioned      structure shown in FIG. 15(A) is excellent in resistance to shock and      impact. Therefore, the oxygen sensor device of this type can      advantageously be used for measuring the partial pressure of the oxygen in      ambient gas with high accuracy over a prolonged period of time. </PAR><PAR>  The oxygen sensor device of the present invention is compact and excellent      in reliability, and can be used with low electric demand. The oxygen      sensor device of the present invention can easily be produced by a      printing technique on a commercial scale without using an adhesive for      providing a diffusion chamber on the surface of a solid electrolyte plate,      differing from the production of a conventional oxygen sensor device. When      an adhesive is used for attaching a housing on the surface of an      electrolyte plate to form a diffusion chamber as in the conventional      oxygen sensor device, it is disadvantageous in that the housing is likely      to slide on the surface of an electrolyte plate before an adhesive      disposed between the housing and the electrolyte plate is solidified, so      that the circumferential base edge cannot be accurately bonded to the      predetermined portion on the surface of the electrolyte plate. Therefore,      defective products are produced at high ratio. Further, it is      disadvantageous in that the cracking of the adhesive layer provided      between a housing and an electrolyte plate is likely to occur when it is      used under severe conditions for a long time, leading to a leakage of a      gas from the diffusion chamber. Therefore, an accurate oxygen      concentration of ambient gas cannot be conducted. However, as mentioned      above, the oxygen sensor device of the present without using an adhesive.      Therefore, the oxygen sensor device of the present invention is free from      the above-mentioned disadvantages. Further, the oxygen sensor device of      the present invention has an advantage in that the glass dome of the      device of the present invention does not require a further working by      means of a machine tool. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  This invention will now be described in detail with reference to the      following Examples but they should not be construed to be limiting the      scope of the present invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  An oxygen sensor device as shown in FIG. 12 is used. In the oxygen sensor      device, solid electrolyte plate 1 is made of zirconium powder containing 8      mol % of Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 and has a round shape of a size of 6 mm in      diameter and 0.2 mm in thickness. Solid electrolyte plate 1 has, at its      center portion, gas inlet means 7 in the form of a through-hole having a      diameter of 10 .mu.m. Two electrodes 2A and 2B are made of platinum and      have a size of 4 mm in diameter and 5 .mu.m in thickness. The entire space      of the diffusion chamber defined by glass dome 4 and solid electrolyte      plate 1 is filled with porous inorganic material layer 3A which has been      prepared by sintering alumina powder having a particle size of not larger      than 20 .mu.m. The thicknesses of the diffusion chamber and the glass dome      each are 10 .mu.m. Electric lead means 6A and 6B respectively connected to      electrodes 2A and 2B are formed on upper side surface 15A of leg member 15      by printing a platinum-containing pasty material, followed by sintering.      The length of leg member 15 is 22 mm. Electric lead means 9A and 9B      connected to heater means 9 is formed on lower side surface 15B of      substrate plate 15. </PAR><PAR>  This oxygen sensor device is produced as follows, in accordance with Method      (II). </PAR><PAR>  The solid electrolyte plate is prepared as follows. A powder of zirconium      containing 8 mol % of Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 is charged in a rubber tube of an      inner diameter of 6 mm. In this instance, a yarn having a diameter of      about 10 .mu.m extends under tension through the axis of the rubber tube.      Then, the powder in the rubber tube is compressed and fired at about      1600.degree. C. for 3 hours to obtain a cylindrical solid rod having an      aperture extending through the axis thereof and having a diameter of about      10 .mu.m. The solid rod is sliced in a perpendicular direction to the      longitudinal aperture to obtain the solid electrolyte plate having an      aperture. </PAR><PAR>  Then, on both surfaces of the electrolyte plate, a platinum-containing      pasty material obtained by mixing a platinum powder having a particle      diameter of 0.1 to 0.5 .mu.m with .alpha.-terpineol is coated by screen      printing and sintered to form electrodes. Next, an alumina-containing      pasty material obtained by mixing alumina having a particle diameter of      not larger than 20 .mu.m with a mixture of butylcarbitol acetate and      nitrocellulose is coated by screen printing over one of the electrodes.      The coated alumina-containing layer is dried and sintered at about      1000.degree. C. Over the resultant alumina layer, a pasty material      obtained by mixing a mixture of butylcarbitol acetate and nitrocellulose      with a glass composed of 12 w/w% of BaO, 15 w/w% of SiO.sub.2, 25 w/w% of      B.sub.2 O.sub.3, 25 w/w% of MgO and 20 w/w% of ZnO and having a thermal      expansion coefficient of 100.times.10.sup.7 /.degree. C., is coated by      screen printing, followed by firing at 900.degree. C. The outer surface of      the glass dome of the resultant composite member is bonded to leg member      15 (having couples each of two electric lead means) by means of an      adhesive, to thereby obtain an assembly of the glass dome, the solid      electrolyte plate having the first and second electrodes and the leg      member attached to the solid electrolyte plate and having the couples each      of two electric lead means. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 15(A) and FIG. 15(B), leg member 15 of the above-obtained      assembly together with the couples of electric lead means is      fluid-tightly, fixedly inserted in slit 27A of support plate 27 made of      alumina. The ceramic support plate 27 has a width of 26 mm, a length of 40      mm and a thickness of 4 mm. The assembly fixed on support plate 27 is      covered with cylindrical, gas permeable cap 26 made of alumina and having      a diameter of 18 mm. The gas permeable cap is fluid-tightly fixed at its      circumferential base edge to groove 26A of support plate 27, to thereby      obtain an oxygen sensor device (Device I). </PAR><PAR>  An electric current is flowed through heater means 9 of the assembly at a      voltage of 3W so that the temperature of the oxygen sensor device is      increased to about 450.degree. C. Then, under an atmosphere of a gas      containing 21 v/v% oxygen, an electric voltage is applied between two      electrodes 2A and 2B and elevated gradually from 0.1 to 2.0V, while      measuring the electric current (.mu.A) flowing between the two electrodes.      The relationship between the applied electric pressure and the measured      electric current is shown in FIG. 16 (see line represented by      ##STR1##      ). </PAR><PAR>  Substantially same procedure as mentioned above is repeated except that the      oxygen concentration is changed to 90.5 v/v%. The relationship between the      applied electric voltage and the electric current measured under the      atmosphere of a gas containing 90.5% oxygen is also shown in FIG. 16 (see      line represented by      ##STR2##      ). </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, substantially the same procedure as mentioned above is repeated      except that the oxygen concentration is changed as shown in Table 2, to      determine a limited current. From the obtained limited current, the oxygen      concentration (found) is calculated by the following formula:      ##EQU1##      wherein a is the value of the limited </PAR><PAR>  current (.mu.A) and c is a constant (225.1). The results are shown in Table      2. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         Oxygen     0      9.67   20.38 49.4  70.4  94.9                                concentration                                                                  (actual) (v/v %)                                                               Limited    0      22.97  51.30 153.6 276.3 669.4                               current                                                                        (.mu.A)                                                                        Oxygen     0      9.70   20.38 49.46 70.69 94.89                               concentration                                                                  (found) (v/v %)                                                                ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  As apparent from Table 2, the oxygen concentration measured by the oxygen      sensor device of the present invention is well in agreement with the      actual oxygen concentration of the ambient gas. </PAR><PAR>  Further, using the above-obtained oxygen sensor device, a response to the      change in the oxygen concentration of ambient gas is determined as      follows. </PAR><PAR>  The oxygen concentration of ambient gas is changed as shown in Table 3.      According to the change of the oxygen concentration, the electric current      measured by means of the oxygen sensor device is changed. The time      required before the oxygen sensor device indicates the occurrence of the      90% change of electric current relative to the entire change (100%) of      electric current which entire change corresponds to the change of the      limited current, is determined (T.sub.90, expressed by seconds). The      results are shown in Table 3. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 3                                                          ______________________________________                                         Change in oxygen                                                               concentration (%)                                                                              T.sub.90 (seconds)                                             ______________________________________                                         21 .fwdarw. 0   21                                                              0 .fwdarw. 21  19                                                             21 .fwdarw. 10  9                                                              10 .fwdarw. 21  7                                                              ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  As apparent from Table 3, the oxygen sensor device of the present invention      shows relatively prompt response to the change in the oxygen concentration      of the ambient gas. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the heating and cooling of the oxygen sensor device is      repeated 10,000 times to give a heat shock to the sensor device.

The formation of electrodes 2A and 2B and porous      inorganic material layer 3A on solid electrolyte plate 1 is conducted in      the same manner as in Example 1. Then, glass dome 4 is formed on porous      inorganic material layer 3A in substantially the same manner as in Example      1 except that immediately after the formation of the glass dome by firing      the glass-containing layer at 900.degree.

The resultant member is attached to leg member 15 in      substantially the same manner as in Example 1 except that the outer      surface of solid electrolyte plate 1 is attached to the upper surface of      leg member 15 as shown in FIG. 13. The assembly is fluid-tightly, fixedly      inserted in slit 27A of support plate 27 and covered with gas permeable      cap 26 as in Example 1 to thereby obtain an oxygen sensor device (Device      II). </PAR><PAR>  (2) Substantially the same procedure as described above is repeated except      that after coating a glass-containing pasty material over the      alumina-containing layer, a glass capillary is planted in the center      portion of the glass-containing layer. The glass capillary has an inner      diameter of 0.2 mm and a length of 2 mm. Then, firing is conducted to form      a glass dome. Thus, an assembly having an orifice in the glass dome in the      form of a capillary is obtained. The assembly is fluid-tightly, fixedly      inserted in slit 27A of support plate 27 and covered with gas permeable      cap 26 as in Example 1 to thereby obtain an oxygen sensor device (Device      III). </PAR><PAR>  (3) Substantially the same procedure as described in above item (1) is      repeated except that after coating a glass-containing pasty material over      the alumina-containing layer, a microsphere of a mixture of a      glass-containing pasty material and 0.2 w/w% of sodium nitrite      (NaNO.sub.2) is taken on the tip end of the needle and embedded at the      center portion of the glass-containing layer, followed by firing to form a      glass dome. Thus, an assembly having an orifice in the glass dome is      obtained. The assembly is fluid-tightly, fixedly inserted in slit 27A of      support plate 27 and covered with gas permeable cap 26 as in Example 1 to      thereby obtain an oxygen sensor device (Device IV). </PAR><PAR>  (4) Substantially the same procedure as described in above item (1) is      repeated except that after coating a glass-containing pasty material over      the alumina-containing layer, an aluminum string having a diameter of 0.1      mm and a melting point of 700.degree.

C.      or higher to form a glass dome. The aluminum string planted on the      glass-containing layer is melted and diffused into the glass-containing      layer during the firing to form an orifice in the glass dome. Thus, an      assembly having an orifice in the glass dome is obtained. The assembly is      fluid-tightly, fixedly inserted in slit 27A of support plate 27 and      covered with gas permeable cap 26 as in Example 1 to thereby obtain an      oxygen sensor device (Device V). </PAR><PAR>  With respect to each of device I obtained in Example 1 and devices II to V      obtained above, ten sample devices are prepared.
