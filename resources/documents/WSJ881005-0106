Tannenbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MON </IN><TEXT>   Small-business exports are surging because of the weaker U.S. dollar and increased export-promotion efforts by federal and state agencies.    Signs of increased small-business exporting are plentiful. For example, new working-capital loan guarantees by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. are expected to double this fiscal year to more than $160 million. &quot;Because of the lower dollar, there are more people who want to export,&quot; says Alan Beard, a loan officer. The bank makes loans mostly to small companies, in amounts as small as $10,000.    With such modest loans, the economic payoff can be huge. &quot;Small businesses could be America's most-successful exporters, mainly because small businesses often can turn on a dime,&quot; says Robert B. Reich, a political economist at Harvard University. &quot;Successful export performance depends on rapid reaction, and big companies can't act quickly because of bureaucratic procedures.&quot;    The Commerce Department's U.S. andamp; Foreign Commercial Service says 3,000 companies, mostly small, that participated in certain overseas trade missions last year generated more than $200 million in initial export sales. &quot;That's not going to end the trade deficit overnight,&quot; says Lew Cramer, acting director-general of the service. &quot;But it's the proverbial first step on a long journey.&quot;    Commerce Department statistics don't break out small-business exports in figuring the trade deficit -- which fell to a 3 1/2-year low of $9.53 billion in July. But the department promises to start doing so this fall.    Most exporters, in fact, are small companies. Of more than 30,000 exporters tracked by Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. in 70 industries, more than half employ fewer than 100 workers, according to Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., research concern. Small Business Administration officials say at least 30,000 more small companies have export potential but aren't in the foreign market.    Last February, the Reagan administration began Export Now, a promotion program aimed mostly at getting small and medium-sized companies to initiate or increase exports.    While exports take time and trouble, they often are more profitable than domestic sales, say small-business owners. U.S. products often sell at premiums in foreign niches, either because competition is soft or because the U.S. products enjoy a cachet. American Natural Beverage Corp., a small New York company, can afford to ship bottles of its Soho-brand soda to Tokyo because they sell for 50% more there. &quot;To the Japanese, it's what sushi is to us, an exotic and fun thing from another culture,&quot; says Sophia Collier, American Natural's president.    Many small-business owners consider exporting too expensive or too risky. &quot;There's a false fear barrier on the part of many small businesses,&quot; says John A. Adams Jr., president of Meiller Research Inc., College Station, Texas. Exports account for about one-third of sales for the small maker and distributor of orthopedic products, and Mr. Adams is an apostle of exports who moonlights as a $200-an-hour consultant.    &quot;Small businesses are really showing an eagerness to get into international trade,&quot; says Sheryl J. Swed, director of the Small Business Administration's office of international trade.    Some evidence: A government handbook for small-business exporters was reprinted after quickly selling out its 20,000-copy first printing this year. And small-business owners have flocked to export seminars. Some 5,000 representatives of small companies are expected to attend an Oct. 20 teleconference with satellite links in at least 67 cities.    &quot;Practically every village and hamlet now has a program to facilitate exports,&quot; says William B. Miller, a Chicago lawyer and export consultant. &quot;We didn't have that a few years ago.&quot;    Of course, not all small manufacturers have export potential. Herb Ouida, the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Xport unit, says some U.S. apparel firms, for example, failed at recent export efforts because their prices weren't competitive. Still, of about 130 concerns Xport has tried to help since its 1982 formation, about 90 have set up overseas markets, Mr. Ouida says.    To overcome skittishness about entering the global market, Xport tells potential exporters about small companies that have succeeded. For example, Spectrum Communications andamp; Electronics Corp., Hicksville, N.Y., landed its first foreign order in 1986. Now exports represent about half its $7.5 million in annual sales, says Gregg Moshensky, international sales director for the maker of electronic paging and voice-messaging systems.    ---              Small Exporters Play Big Role   Percentage of exporting manufacturers with fewer than 500 employees    Misc.

Nevertheless, most exporters are small companies. Companies which import, as well as export, tend to be somewhat larger in size, but that group also is dominated by very small firms.
