This license expires on April 30, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>On January 21, 1981, the NRC received notification that the NRC licenseeknown as United States Radium Corporation (U.S. Radium), the prior licenseeon all of the above licenses, had changed its name to Safety Light Corporation.There was no indication at that time that the change involved any ownershipor organizational changes. Consequently, routine administrative licenseamendments changing the corporate name from U.S. Radium Corporation toSafety Light Corporation were issued on March 31, 1982 to modify LicenseNo. 37-00030-08; and on January 20, 1983 to modify License Nos. 37-00030-02,37-00030-07E, 37-00030-09G, and 37-00030-10G.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>As early as 1983, the NRC sought clarification from Safety Light concerningcorporate transactions that potentially could affect cleanup responsibility.Specifically, the letter that transmitted NRC Inspection Report 83-01,dated September 22, 1983, sought clarification, based upon inspectionsat the Bloomsburg facility, of the effects of an apparent corporate transferof licensed activity. Safety Light's November 11, 1983 response to therequest in the September 22, 1983 letter appears both incomplete and misleadingin that it is silent on the details of the May 16, 1980 Agreement and Planof Merger between U.S. Radium Corporation and USR Industries, Inc. anda July 11, 1980 U.S. Radium letter to its stockholders (``the 1980 Plan'').In its response, Safety Light refers back to the administrative name changeprocessed in response to its January 21, 1981 submittal and affirmativelystates that there were no organizational changes made due to the name change.Since that time, the NRC has obtained and reviewed the 1980 plan. Basedupon a review of the 1980 Plan, it now appears U.S. Radium merged withUSR Industries, Inc. (Industries). It specifically appears that the formerNRC licensee known as U.S. Radium Corporation, through its officers anddirectors, had also created the new corporation, known as USR Industries,Inc. After merging with Industries, the former U.S. Radium became a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Industries, and then changed the name of the segregated NRCactivities to Safety Light Corporation. Industries also transferred allits non-licensed assets and business to five other newly created corporations(USR Lighting, Inc.; USR Chemicals, Inc.; USR Metals, Inc.; Metreal, Inc.;and USR Natural Resources, Inc.), then wholly owned subsidiaries of USRIndustries. Pinnacle Petroleum, Inc. is apparently another subsidiary ofIndustries. Thereafter, Safety Light Corporation, which had the activitiesauthorized by NRC, was sold to Lime Ridge Industries, Incorporated, a corporationcreated by former employees of Industries and U.S. Radium.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Neither prior notice to the NRC was given, nor NRC approval obtained, regardingthe 1980 restructuring and subsequent sale or the full circumstances ofthe transfer of the NRC license, in violation of section 184 of the AtomicEnergy Act and 10 CFR 30.34(b), which prohibit the transfer of a license,either directly or indirectly, unless the NRC, after securing full information,gives its consent in writing. It further appears from the 1980 Plan thatthese corporate transactions were a deliberate attempt to isolate the liabilityand responsibility for cleanup of the Bloomsburg facility (discussed below)from other, presumably more profitable, aspects of U.S. Radium's, and laterIndustries', business ventures.Neither U.S. Radium, USR Industries, nor any of their successor corporationsor subsidiaries can avoid responsibility and liability for the cleanupof the Bloomsburg facility through the unlawful transfer of an NRC license,i.e., a transfer without the consent of the NRC, after full disclosure.Therefore, each of the corporations referred to in the caption of thisOrder (``Corporations'') is, and remains, jointly and severally liableand responsible for the cleanup of the Bloomsburg facility and for theconduct of all other activities on that site that require an NRC license.On April 20, 1988, following renewed concerns with cleanup issues at thesite, the NRC again sought clarification of the relationships among thevarious corporations with apparent interests in the Bloomsburg facilityand the role that each would play in the cleanup of that site. In starkcontrast to the January 21, 1981 and November 11, 1983 submittals, Industries'June 24, 1988 response concedes that the name change was made concurrentlywith a corporate reorganization, although even the June 24, 1988 responsefails to state that one purpose of the reorganization apparently was tolimit liability, as stated in the July 11, 1980 U.S. Radium letter to itsstockholders. Consequently, Safety Light's January 21, 1981, November 11,1981, and June 24, 1988 submissions to the NRC were incomplete and inaccuratein material respects.<ITAG tagnum="84">V</ITAG>In addition to the foregoing, the soil and groundwater at the Bloomsburgfacility have become radioactively contaminated as a result of past operationsat the facility. The principal radionuclides are tritium, strontium-90and radium-226. The levels exceed NRC limits that would permit unrestrictedaccess to the site. Tritium has also been detected in groundwater off-sitein the well of a nearby house. Although the tritium in that well is notyet above drinking water limits set by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, further off-site contamination is likely to occur over time dueto the movement of groundwater and soil erosion. Pits on the site containunknown types and quantities of radioactive material that pose a potentialthreat to the health and safety of employees and any others on the site.Access to the site by the public is not restricted and members of the publichave been and may be present. Therefore, access needs to be restrictedand decontamination of the facility and real estate is required and mustcommence immediately.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI</ITAG>Prior to the numerous transactions set forth above, on January 25, 1979,the NRC amended License No. 37-00030-02 to include License Condition 14to require a nine-month plan for implementing specified decontaminationactivities submitted earlier in a U.S. Radium letter dated October 23,1978. This letter also stated that a schedule would be developed for decontaminationactivities beyond the activities specified in the decontamination plan.Condition 13 of License No. 37-00030-02 required U.S. Radium to providethe NRC with a report on the status of decontamination efforts and a scheduleof work for 12 month periods beginning July 1, 1979. The NRC's inspectionof the Bloomsburg facilities on November 12, 1986 and the site contaminationsurvey provided in a letter to the NRC dated February 6, 1987 indicatethat the specified decontamination activities were not performed. Furthermore,while Safety Light has provided a report of environmental monitoring eachyear since 1983, Safety Light has not provided the NRC with the requiredreport on the status of decontamination efforts and schedule of work sinceLicense Condition 13 was added to the license.As a result, by letter dated April 20, 1988, Safety Light, Industries,and all other apparent successor corporations to U.S. Radium were requestedto provide a decommissioning plan for the site which would permit the releaseof the site for unrestricted use. This decommissioning plan was to providefor a final radiological survey that would include all areas where licensedmaterial has been used, stored, or buried. The decontamination of the sitewas permitted to be gradual, extending over a period of ten years, butwas to commence within twelve months.No substantive responses were made to these requests for a plan. By now,the NRC would have expected to have observed action to satisfy the foregoinglicense conditions. On July 8, 1988, the NRC inspected the Bloomsburg facilityand confirmed that there was no current effort underway to decontaminatethe facility. This failure to commence the required decontamination constitutesa willful violation of an NRC requirement. As stated above, the NRC considersall corporate successors of U.S. Radium jointly and severally liable forsite cleanup and all other activities requiring a license.Under the terms of Conditions 13 and 14 of License No. 37-00030-02, aswell as the NRC's April 20, 1988 letter, these corporations were put onclear notice that decontamination was necessary and required, and weregiven ample opportunity to submit proposed milestones and plans for decontamination.Rather than formulate and implement a decommissioning plan in responseto the 1979 license conditions, it now appears U.S. Radium reorganizedin a deliberate attempt to limit liability and responsibility for cleanup.Despite repeated efforts by the NRC to get U.S. Radium and its successors,including but not limited to Safety Light, to take steps to initiate meaningfuldecontamination efforts at the Bloomsburg facility, these steps have notbeen taken. The presence of considerable known contamination, coupled withthe uncertain extent of that and other, as yet unknown, contamination requiresthat action be taken immediately to survey, stabilize, and clean up thesite.In order to ensure that the Corporation provide adequate resources to evaluate,plan, and implement decontamination efforts with proper radiological safetyprocedures, I have determined that specific decontamination requirementsand milestones are necessary and that decontamination needs to begin expeditiouslyso as to minimize any threat to public health and safety. As a result ofthe failure of U.S. Radium and its successors to comply with section 184of the Atomic Energy Act and 10 CFR 30.34(b), the successor corporationsremain subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. In view of the corporations'apparently willful failure to fully meet the terms of section 184 of theAtomic Energy Act and 10 CFR 30.34(b), as well as other conditions in thelicense, though given opportunity to do so, and their incomplete and inaccuratestatements to the NRC, and in view of the need to expeditiously begin decontaminationto minimize any threat to public health and safety, I have determined thatthe NRC lacks reasonable assurance that site characterization and decontaminationof the Bloomsburg facility will be initiated and completed in an orderlyand timely fashion to ensure that the health and safety of the public,including current employees and adjoining landowners, will be protected.This is particularly so in light of the apparent financial inability ofany one successor corporation to U.S. Radium to clean up the Bloomsburgfacility. Accordingly, the public health, safety and interest require thatthe actions specified by section VII of this Order commence immediately.For these reasons and pursuant to 10 CFR 2.204, no prior notice is required,and this Order is immediately effective.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII</ITAG>In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161r,161o, 182, 184 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, andthe Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 32,<T3>It Is Hereby Ordered, Effective Immediately, That License Nos.</T3>37-00030-02, -08, -07E, -09G and  -10G <T3>Are Modified As Follows:</T3>A.
