Was Govaerts just a nervous buyer worried about his fragilecargo?   No, says U.S. Customs. Its allegations say he was making sureTeradyne would abide by a bargain to mislabel the boxes so theycould be exported illegally to Bulgaria in the Soviet bloc.   In the boxes was equipment for testing and repairing computerchips that can be used in personal computers, video games andmissile guidance systems.   Teradyne participated in an undercover ``sting'' operation.Govaerts was arrested and charged with violating federal exportlaws.   Western officials say the export of militarily sensitive goodsis difficult to control, and some liken the flow to narcoticstraffic.   ``To completely stop it is impossible,'' said Viktor Jacobson,the U.S. Customs attache in Bonn, West Germany.   Roger Urbanski, who heads the U.S. Customs office in Vienna,said ``it's a race without a finish line'' because of rapidtechnological advances.   Over the years, legally or illegally, the Soviets and theirallies have obtained billions of dollars worth of sensitivetechnology.   Analysts say the acquisitions have aided Soviet research anddevelopment efforts, enabling them to devote scarce resources toother areas.   A CIA report said the Kremlin captures high technology throughan espionage program run by the Soviet Military IndustrialCommission and an illegal trade operation in the Foreign TradeMinistry.   It said most of the ministry's program involves Western tradersunder contract to the Soviets.   When the suspects in the Boston case pressed ahead with theorder despite legal problems, authorities said, Teradyne grewsuspicious of their persistence and notified the Customs Service.   Officials said they have been alerted to other cases bycompeting companies, disgruntled employees, intelligence servicesand random checks of export shipments.   One investigator was tipped to a case when he overheard anexporter boasting in a Belgian bar about how easy it was to diverthigh technology, officials said. He learned that the braggartoperated two German ``front,'' or dummy, companies.   G. Jonart, head of Belgium's customs investigations, recalledthat a spot check of goods being shipped through Belgium uncovereda scheme to divert U.S. computer equipment worth about $100,000 toBulgaria.   Requests from the Soviets to their contacts for sensitivetechnology usually are detailed, officials said.   ``The other side knows exactly what they want,'' said Jacobson,the Customs attache in Bonn. ``They are looking for specific itemsdown to the model number.''   In a June report on technology transfer, the North AtlanticAssembly said Moscow earmarked $1.4 billion in the late 1970s forpurchases of ``one-of-a-kind Western hardware and documents.''   ``Each year, between 3,000 and 5,000 new, amended andre-approved requirements for hardware and documents are issued andform the basis for the Soviet `shopping list' of Westerntechnology,'' it said. The assembly is made up of legislators fromthe 16 NATO nations.   About one-third of the high-tech requirements established by theSoviet Military Industial Commission are completely or partiallyfilled annually, said the report by the CIA's Technology TransferAssessment Center.   Soviet trade agents often contact unscrupulous businessmen atEuropean trade fairs where hundreds of companies gather for a fewdays to do business, officials said.   They also have an elaborate network of foreign tradeorganizations, commercial offices, joint companies and foreignprocurement offices, according to the CIA report.   Urbanski, the Customs man in Vienna, said: ``The Soviets put outthe request. The first one with the market and best price gets thedeal. It's a normal transaction at an inflated price.''   If the Kremlin really wants an item the sky is the limit,officials said, and the Soviets may pay triple the going rate ormore.   ``Ideology seems to have drained out of all of it,'' Urbanskisaid. ``They do it only for money,'' said Jacobson.   With the deal struck, a Western European company, possibly afront for the Soviets, may order the merchandise and have it sentlegally to a NATO nation such as France, Germany or Belgium.   Once the goods are in Europe, the diverters may disguise thepackaging and shipping instructions and send the material throughother countries _ possibily neutral Switzerland or Austria _ beforeslipping it into the Soviet bloc.   ``Money is no object in transportation,'' Jacobson said. ``It'sthe cost of doing business.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 14</NOTE></DOC>
