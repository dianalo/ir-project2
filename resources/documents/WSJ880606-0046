By quickly acting to plug some of their stranded long-distance customers into substitute networks, the two communications giants induced some heavy users to consider permanently bypassing the connecting services of the local telephone company.    Over the weekend, Illinois Bell restored service to the last of the affected customers. But within hours of the May 8 fire that destroyed the Ameritech Inc. unit's crucial switch in Hinsdale, Ill., and knocked out service to 35,000 customers, MCI and ATandamp;T dispatched teams to check on major clients in the industrial and high-technology corridor in Chicago's western suburbs. Over the next few days, both carriers installed microwave dishes that gave big customers digital radio links to the long-distance networks, substituting for Illinois Bell connections.    ATandamp;T says it hooked up about 25 companies; MCI made connections for six. U.S. Sprint says it didn't have any large customers in the area with a direct line of sight to a microwave tower, but it helped ATandamp;T restore service for one customer.    &quot;We were dead in the water,&quot; says Wayne Hilty, operations business manager for Prime Computer Inc.'s office in Oak Brook, Ill., which serves a wide swath of the country from Minneapolis to Houston and from Denver to Pittsburgh. &quot;The first people we heard from were from MCI.&quot; Within two days, he says, MCI installed a microwave dish the size of a garbage can lid on the roof.    Because of the fire, companies such as Prime Computer and Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. -- as well as smaller corporate tenants in big office buildings -- are more willing to explore alternative routes to long-distance networks.    &quot;I think the big users have a lot of risk&quot; with a network that funnels calls through choke points, argues Joseph Nacchio, ATandamp;T's director of network operations and engineering.    Given the fire experience, Prime Computer's Mr. Hilty predicts that the companies in his building will get together and decide whether to install a permanent microwave dish on the roof. Prime Computer, based in Natick, Mass, will begin weighing alternative access for its other facilities, he says.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet, another MCI customer, is considering permanent and backup alternative access to the local telephone network when it moves to its new offices in Naperville, Ill., in July, says the company's telecommunications director, Jim Haines.    The regional Bell companies often cite the threat of bypassing the local network in urging the government to lift restrictions on their business. Although a study for the Justice Department found that more than 99% of all telephone traffic flows through the local networks, the Bell companies fear that a significant portion of their business could be drained off.    But the costs vary considerably. MCI estimates that the small, emergency microwave dishes it has installed in Illinois cost about $60,000 per customer. In contrast, a permanent alternative arrangement could run as much as $1 million, says ATandamp;T's Mr. Nacchio.    Even U.S. Sprint, whose latest advertising campaign promoting its fiber-optic network shows a microwave tower being blown to kingdom come, acknowledges it detonated only one tower. The company says it is maintaining towers as backups in some metropolitan areas. </TEXT></DOC>
