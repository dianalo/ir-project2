Aliquots fromsaturation pastes were passed through a Sephadex/sup TM/ G-15 gel filtrationcolumn and the fractions analyzed for total soluble C, Cu, Ni, and Zn.Infrared spectra were recorded for fractions containing a soluble-C ormetal-concentration maximum. The relative strength of adsorption bandsin the IR spectra, which were diagnostic for polysaccharides, proteins,and amino acids, declined over the study period. The dominant spectralfeatures for extracts of sludge-soil mixtures incubated 4 weeks or longerwere diagnostic bands for aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Atleast squares (L{sup 2}) approximation to proton titration curves wasused to select a subset of ligands, which provided the smallest errorterm. The set of ligands from which the subset was selected was acetate,citrate, maleate, phthalate, salicylate, arginine, lysine, ornithine,and valine. Total soluble concentrations of Ca, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cl, NH{sub3}, PO{sub 4} and organic ligands, and pH and P/sub CO2/ values, wereused to calculate ion speciation in the extracts via the computer programGEOCHEM. Values for the fractions of total soluble Cu, Ni, and Zn boundby soluble organic matter as predicted by GEOCHEM agreed with valuesdetermined by gel separation.</TEXT></DOC>
