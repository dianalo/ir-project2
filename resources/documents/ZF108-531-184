(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LINKS, TIES, MAPS, TWISTS CAN GET YOU THERE FROM HEREandM;Just what data can a personal computer user in a large organization access?andO;A few years ago, the answer would have been simple: Whatever data was storedon the hard disk or floppies.andM;The answer broadened when the user's PC got connected to a network fileserver.andP;  That made all the data available on the file server accessible.andM;Today, the PC user's potential data access is far more encompassing.andP;  Now theuser, with security approval, may access data on any computer in the entireenterprise: DB2, SQL/DS, IMS, IDMS, Oracle and many other databases and filestructures.andM;And with the wider data access has come increased complexity.andM;&quot;When you take the number of potentially different data sources, and youmultiply that times the number of network protocols currently in use, andthen combine that with the actual application/end-user requirements, thenumber of combinations becomes overwhelming,&quot; said IBM's George Zagelow,manager of architecture and standards, in the Programming Systems group ofSanta Teresa Laboratories in San Jose, Calif.andM;&quot;We really don't have anyone who has been able to solve the general problem.andO;But the industry continues to pour an awful lot of resource into overlapping,mismatched functions, and that leaves the database administrator to find theright set of functions for his set of users.andP;  And that's an overwhelming taskin itself,&quot; said Zagelow, who is responsible for the definition and extensionof the SQL database interface within IBM's Systems Application Architecture.andM;&quot;In terms of where the solutions are coming from, there's essentially amyriad of partial solutions available from a wide variety of sources,&quot; saidZagelow.andP;  &quot;Database vendors play, networking vendors play, but a lot of theend-user tool vendors play, too.&quot;andM;IBM is in the game as well.andP;  According to Zagelow, the company has developedan architectural response to the heterogeneous database access problem.andM;Heterogeneous database access often requires two accompanying components: theability to obtain data from several different types of databases, as well asthe ability to use different communication networks.andM;While database and networking vendors provide their own respectivecomponents, they often provide aspects of the accompanying component as well.andO;Database vendors often put the separate components of the solution togetherinto a workable package for an end user.andM;Oracle Corp., Belmont, Calif., for example, provides both components.andP;  Tosupport its heterogeneous database software, Oracle provides its own SQL*Netclient/server connectivity software that supports a wide variety of transportprotocols, application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating systems.andO;(See Figure 1.)andP;  Oracle recently launched a new Network Products division toaddress the issue of interconnectivity.andM;&quot;By focusing our network computing efforts in a product division, we arebroadening Oracle's commitment to open systems and industry standards,&quot; saidSmokey Wallace, Oracle's general manager of Network Products.andM;Meanwhile, networking vendors are showing increasing interest in addressingthe protocols of the application layer--the seventh layer--of theInternational Standards Organization's (ISO's) Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) reference model.andM;Many networking vendors are participating in efforts to standardize remoteprocedure calls (RPCs) and remote data access (RDA).andP;  When the Ansi and ISORDA and Transaction Processing (TP) standards are solidified in the next yearor so, the interoperability work of database and other software developerswill be simplified.andM;IBM is working closely with the RDA effort.andP;  That is good news.andP;  Since manyof IBM's products and approaches have led to de facto standards, the combinedwork of IBM and the standards bodies will be particularly effective.andM;&quot;We at IBM have stepped up our involvement in the RDA activity over the lastseveral years,&quot; said Zagelow.andP;  &quot;As we put the finishing touches on thearchitecture we'll use to connect our SAA database managers, we're offeringthat technology to the RDA Group.&quot;andM;He said IBM has been pushing its technology into the RDA standard as rapidlyas the group can assimilate it.andP;  At times the group has been overwhelmed bythe mass of information IBM has put forth, Zagelow said.andM;&quot;The hope is,&quot; he said, &quot;that we can expedite a more general heterogeneoussolution--that is, beyond SAA to all relational database managers.&quot;andM;From IBM's point of view, hierarchical databases and Vsam files are theprimary data sources that their customers need to access.andP;  Network databasesfigure in as well.andM;&quot;There is a rapid movement of data into relational databases,&quot; said Zagelow,&quot;because that's where we can give better access from the tool side.&quot;andM;He explained that the older data stores have not been particularly amenableto direct end-user access through tools, mainly because of the physicalorganization of the data.andP;  He said that the ease with which end-user toolscan access RDBMSs is primarily what makes relational a key to the solution.andM;As Zagelow pointed out, more than just database and networking vendors areinvolved with this problem.andP;  Some companies, such as DB/Access in SantaClara, Calif., are dedicated solely to providing tools for heterogeneousaccess.andM;Other vendors like Lotus Development Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., known fora specific software product, are finding ways for their users to accessheterogeneous databases and import that data into their software.andP;  NaturalLanguage Inc. (NLI) in Berkeley, Calif., offers NLI Gateway, which providestransparent access to multiple vendors' databases through simple Englishsentences.andM;No matter how simple the approach, it is still a good idea for either thedatabase administrator (DBA) or a systems analyst to assist the end user ininitially setting up the heterogeneous access.andP;  Today, any large,heterogeneous installation that bypasses the DBA is either not set up rightor asking for trouble--or both.andM;&quot;The DBA or data analyst always plays a key role,&quot; said Howard Sholkin, aspokesman for Technology Concepts, Sudbury, Mass.andM;Data extracts were the earliest way of accessing data from one data model foruse in an application using another data model.andM;IBM's Data Extract (DXT) is an example of this.andP;  End users utilized DXT toextract data from IMS.andP;  The data can then be used either in a flat fileformat or loaded into a relational database like DB2.andM;A newer approach is to &quot;piggyback&quot; onto an existing application system to getdata.andP;  Implementations of this approach can range from simple scripting tofull-scale application development software that revolves around existingapplication systems.andP;  Technology Concepts offers this &quot;piggyback&quot; approach.andO;(See sidebar, &quot;The 'Piggyback' Method,&quot; p. 57.)andM;Other procedures go directly into the source database.andP;  With this approach,often there is a &quot;mapping&quot; between the data in the source data model and arelational image of this data, resulting in what some vendors call a&quot;dataless&quot; database or a &quot;virtual&quot; database.andM;Basically, a virtual database is a conceptual way of looking at data that isactually stored elsewhere--often in a different data model.andP;  It gives an enduser, for example, a way of looking at data from a relational point of vieweven though the data is stored in a hierarchical database.andP;  Experienced DBAsare usually involved in the mapping process.andM;Oracle's approach to heterogeneous access to differing data models is to mapdata structures.andM;Oracle's overall heterogeneous database access is through what the companycalls database gateway software.andP;  Oracle provides a series of SQL*Connectproducts that permit access to a wide variety of databases through standardSQL commands.andP;  An end user, sitting at a desktop computer, can issue SQLcommands and access both relational and nonrelational databases.andM;According to Gene Shklar, Oracle's director of marketing, Network Products,&quot;With a product like SQL*Connect, you can access data from an Oracle databaseat the same time you're accessing an IMS database.andP;  And to the end user--orthe application--it looks like it's coming from the same source.&quot;andM;SQL*Connect can access IMS, DB2, SQL/DS and IDMS databases.andP;  It works inconjunction with SQL*Net to permit a single SQL statement to reference tablesstored in multiple vendors' SQL database systems.andM;Shklar described another aspect of the product's transparency.andP;  &quot;With yourdatabase gateway built correctly,&quot; he said, &quot;if you later migrate your datafrom IMS to a relational database like Oracle, your end user doesn't have tobe concerned.andP;  Nothing needs to be changed in your application.andP;  It willstill continue to work.andP;  What is seen, perhaps, is improved performance.&quot;andO;(See sidebar, &quot;New Access Path to Old Data,&quot; p. 61.)andM;Another interesting feature of database gateways is that PC software toolscan be used to access data from old, hierarchical databases.andM;&quot;With something like SQL*Connect for IMS,&quot; according to Shklar, &quot;all of asudden--right from a Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet--you can access data from an IMSdatabase.&quot;andM;This kind of interconnection capability is not only being offered by databasecompanies, said Shklar, it is also being offered by tool software companies.andM;Tools from different vendors can also be combined to create increasedcapabilities.andP;  Shklar said, &quot;You could use a software tool from Lotus toaccess an Oracle database when, in actuality, that Oracle database accessmight be going through SQL*Connect to an IMS database and a DB2 database.&quot;andM;Robert Roberts, a senior consultant with Oracle, said, &quot;End users keepdifferent kinds of data on different platforms.andP;  They have their graphicalinformation on Oracle databases and their product information on IMS.andP;  Theymay want to access related data from each system using an SQL JOIN.andP;  Theseproducts give them a way to do that.&quot;andM;Vickie Cunningham, another senior consultant at Oracle, said, &quot;A key point isthat you're using native Ansi standard SQL to access IMS data.andP;  So you nowhave the ability to leverage your programming staff.andP;  You don't have to haveall your people trained in the nitty gritty of DL/1 calls.&quot;andM;The Oracle technique does not use large data extracts.andP;  That is, it does notmove large sections of IMS data into flat files before accessing specificfields.andP;  It goes right in after raw IMS data.andP;  The fact that the data in IMSand the data in Oracle follow diverse data models and are structured verydifferently is not a problem.andM;&quot;With our technique,&quot; said Cunningham, &quot;the source data stays in its nativeform.andP;  We provide a mapping of the source data structure so that weunderstand it.andM;&quot;For example, in IMS, we look at the parent-child structure to be able tobuild a view of the data that provides unique identifiers.andP;  We mayconcatenate a couple of fields to provide unique identifiers.andP;  But the pointis that all this is happening in the Connect code.andP;  The IMS source dataitself is not moved out of its native structure into an actual relationalstructure,&quot; Cunningham said.andM;The data stays where it is.andP;  &quot;So, you don't have redundant data,&quot; heexplained.andP;  &quot;More importantly, your existing production programs will workjust as they always have, because your existing production data is still outthere.&quot;andM;Roberts added, &quot;We also automate the process of capturing information fromIMS data definitions and COPY code definitions that describe IMS data.andP;  Webuild something akin to an interactive IMS data dictionary.andP;  That datadictionary is used by Connect to build SSA [segment search argument] andnon-SSA predicate information so that it can satisfy SQL WHERE clauses.andM;&quot;As far as an end user is concerned, he thinks he's accessing an SQL table.andO;It is what we would call a 'pseudotable' and would be based on an IMSsegment.&quot;andM;Some people are concerned that Oracle products might modify native IMS code.andO;Roberts said that Oracle does not have harmful hooks into IMS.andM;&quot;MIS shops,&quot; said Joe Winograd, director for Advanced Services with Oracle,&quot;want the interface to be at the published and clearly documented level, thestandard interface level, and that's what we do.&quot;andM;The software is not affected by new releases of IMS.andP;  &quot;A key point here,&quot;added Cunningham, &quot;is that you can go to new releases of IMS and not have toworry about Connect*IMS working.andP;  IMS message programs are always upwardlycompatible with new releases, so our product, which is based on those messageprograms, is likewise upwardly compatible.&quot;andM;STERLING'S ACCESS SOLUTIONSandM;Another heavy contender in the heterogeneous database access arena isSterling Software.andP;  Both the Dylakor Division, Chatsworth, Calif., and theAnswer Systems Division, Canoga Park, Calif., offer tools to accessheterogeneous databases.andM;Various tools from Sterling can perform online query, ad hoc reporting,downloading of mainframe data to PCs, production reporting or reportgeneration.andP;  Some components reside on the mainframe (server); others, on theworkstation (client).andM;&quot;DYL-280 II Relational can interface with DB2, SQL/DS, IMS, DL/I, CA-IDMS,Teradata's DBC and other database and file systems,&quot; said Carole Morton,president of Dylakor.andP;  Other &quot;callable&quot; databases, such as Total, Adabas andCA-Datacom/DB and various file structures, can also be processed usingDYL-280 II Relational.andP;  DYL-280 II works in batch mode, but it can befront-ended with a menu system that runs in TSO, CMS and CICS.andM;DYL-IQ Express is an interactive, online query and reporting system thatprovides transparent and simultaneous access to DB2 tables, IMS databases andVsam files.andP;  DYL-VLink offers connectivity between PCs and mainframes,supporting over 30 different communications protocols.andM;&quot;We're finding that more and more people want to get to information frommultiple sources,&quot; said Morton.andM;Micro/Answer II, from Sterling's Answer Systems Division, was designed withthe PC end user in mind.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andP;  It provides transparent access toDB2, SQL/DS, IMS/DB, DL/I, Vsam, Adabas, IDMS and other databases.andO;Micro/Answer also handles all required communications protocols in themainframe environments of IMS/DC, CICS and TSO.andM;The Answer/Extractor component is mainframe-resident, running under MVS/XA,MVS/ESA and VSE/SP.andP;  The Micro/Answer component resides at the workstationand provides the user with a series of menu-driven screens for generation ofdatabase inquiries.andM;&quot;The user can access data from many databases, but as far as the user isconcerned, it's in one database.andP;  In fact, you might say it's a virtualrelational table as far as the user is concerned,&quot; said Answer Systems' FredBraddock, VP, Research andamp; Development.andM;The DBA gets very involved in the process of setting up the initial systemand determining which fields different users may access.andP;  &quot;The user sees alist of field names that the DBA permits him to see,&quot; said Braddock.andP;  &quot;Andthat list could be an assemblage from a lot of different databases.andP;  It's anextension of the view concept of DB2.andP;  It's a 'mythical' table.andP;  We call oursa logical data view, which, in our mind, is an extension of that view conceptbecause it marries in not just DB2 tables, but IMS, Vsam and others as well.&quot;andM;The Answer/DB system divides data access into two broad categories: IBM andother.andP;  &quot;We have automatic and totally transparent capabilities to all ofIBM's databases and file structures,&quot; said Braddock.andM;For non-IBM DBMSs, Answer/DB provides a generalized interface that allowsinstallations to integrate their database managers into the system.andM;One of the more interesting approaches to heterogeneous database access isfrom Gupta Technologies, Menlo Park, Calif.andM;Gupta's products use the LAN database itself to access heterogeneous datawithin the enterprise.andP;  It acts as an intermediary between the end user andthe existing heterogeneous production files.andM;The Gupta DBMS, SQLBase, was designed especially for a PC LAN and multiusers.andO;Hence, it does not have the resource &quot;intensiveness&quot; of systems that wereoriginally designed for minicomputers or mainframes and ported to a PCenvironment--nor the limitations of systems designed for stand-alone PC use.andM;It provides seamless integration into mainframe and minicomputer databasesystems by supporting gateways to DB2 and Oracle databases.andP;  It permitsapplication programs to run on PC workstations but transparently access SQLdatabases that reside on mainframes, minis or microbased data servers.andM;Gupta offers a variety of network components.andP;  (See Figure 3.)andP;  SQLRouter isinstalled on PC clients and routes requests to the appropriate server orhost.andP;  SQL-Gateway is installed on the LAN Server.andP;  It redirects SQL requeststo the target DBMSs and manages multiple client requestor sessions on a LAN.andO;SQLHost resides on the host mainframe where it translates SQL/API messages toDB2 requests and submits them to DB2.andP;  It also manages multiple clientrequestors and gateways.andP;  The SQLWindows tool is used to create graphicaluser interfaces for databases, including DB2.andM;Another popular front-end tool for heterogeneous database access is NaturalLanguage's NLI Gateway, an English language interface to relationaldatabases.andP;  Transparent access is provided through NLI Gateway to Oracle,Ingres, Sybase, Informix and Digital Equipment Corp.'s Rdb.andM;Connections to foreign databases are made through the NLI Connector, aknowledge-based tool used to teach Natural relationships.andM;&quot;Once the connection has been made to different databases residing on anetwork,&quot; said Tania Amochaev, NLI president and CEO, &quot;the end user can ask aquestion in plain English, not knowing or caring where the data resides.&quot;andM;An end user enters a request in English and NLI Gateway translates thesentence into the appropriate SQL query.andP;  It then provides a response inEnglish.andM;Another easy-to-use end-user tool for accessing heterogeneous databases isprovided by Informix of Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  With Informix's Wingz DataLinkinterface, non-SQL-literate users can create SQL queries to RDBMSs usingsimple point-and-click options.andM;SQL is providing a way for heterogeneous access to span object-orienteddatabases and relational systems through a type of object-oriented querylanguage.andP;  Tom Atwood, founder and chairman of Object Design, based inBurlington, Mass., said, &quot;A programmer can issue an OOL request to theobject-oriented database and have the OODBMS map that into an SQL requestwhen the necessary data is available in a relational DBMS.&quot;andP;  (See relatedstory on object-oriented development trends on page 32.)andM;NON-IBM TO IBM LINKSandM;Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, Mass., and Informix are two majorvendors who are adding to the heterogeneous access capabilities of their owndatabases.andP;  Both are using Answer/DB from Sterling Software's Answer SystemsDivision to access data from IBM's IMS database.andP;  Digital's VAXlink workswith Answer/DB to provide access to IMS and Vsam.andM;&quot;VAXlink is an extraction tool,&quot; said Anne Thomas, Data Base SystemsInteroperability product manager for Digital Equipment Corp., Nashua, N.H.andM;The products work together in a client/server architecture.andP;  The VAXlinkClient resides on the VAX system.andP;  Answer/DB Extractor for VAXlink is theserver portion and resides on the IBM mainframe.andP;  The extracted data ispassed to the VAX, where it is stored in an Rdb/VMS database.andM;Digital provides DB2 access through the client/server architecture of Vida.andO;An interoperability gateway tool, Vida provides direct transparent accessfrom Rdb/VMS applications to non-Rdb/VMS databases.andP;  Vida Client is aVAX-based product that accepts DB2 requests from VAX applications and passesthe requests via the DECnet/SNA Gateway to the IBM component, Vida Server forDB2.andP;  The Vida Server component accesses the IBM data and returns it to theVida Client.andM;&quot;Vida for DB2 is not an extract system.andP;  It provides direct access from Rdbinto DB2,&quot; said Thomas.andM;According to Thomas, interoperability and interconnectivity are important toDigital.andP;  &quot;Obviously we are going to endeavor to connect up to everyone thatwe can,&quot; she said.andM;DB/Access, located in Santa Clara, Calif., has its own line of heterogeneousaccess software, but uses Answer/DB to go into IMS databases.andM;DB/Access, like Answer/DB, has a PC component and a mainframe component.andP;  ThePC-based product, View/PC, is a Microsoft Windows application equipped withpull-down menus and point-and-click operation.andP;  The Lead-Me feature in thesoftware can build an SQL request as users pick their database, field namesand selection criteria from menus.andM;Access/Star, the host component, is designed to plug and play in the mostcommonly used environments.andP;  It has interfaces to data ranging from flatfiles and Vsam to SQL products like DB2 and Oracle.andM;DB/Access is currently working on major improvements to its overall productline to address the new requirements imposed by LANs, client/serverarchitectures and distributed databases.andM;&quot;We also have plans for a distributed update,&quot; said Allan Rofer, chiefarchitect for DB/Access.andP;  The new product will be called the InteractiveWorkstation Interface.andM;Another approach to heterogeneous database access is throughfourth-generation languages (4GLs).andP;  Focus, from Information Builders Inc.,andO;New York, is a good example of this.andM;&quot;Focus can provide direct, transparent, realtime access to any major hostdatabase from a PC,&quot; said Keith Toleman, marketing manager for the MicroProducts division.andM;IBI recently announced and is delivering PC/Focus release 5.5, and aDirect/Connect module for PC to mainframe communication via a 3270 datastream.andP;  A Gateway Connect module, for linking LANs to IBM mainframes viaLU6.2 protocols, is due to ship this summer.andP;  &quot;You run your application onthe PC, low-level calls for data go up to the mainframe, and the data comesback to the PC,&quot; Toleman said.andM;IBI's advantages include the ability of Focus to access data in manydifferent databases and file formats, the large base of Focus applicationsand name identification with MIS professionals, Toleman said.andM;UNISYS' AUSTRALIAN CONNECTIONandM;Unisys is working to connect its PC users to heterogeneous databases.andO;Australian Airlines, a domestic airline headquartered in Melbourne, recentlyawarded a $4 million contract to Unisys for LAN products and Personal[Workstation.sup.2] units to meet the future requirements of over 200 users.andO;The combined [LAN/PW.sup.2] platform will allow any user in the airline'snationwide network to access many databases and applications from a singleworkstation.andM;&quot;An agent needs to get to over 25 different applications,&quot; explained MartyKrempasky, a Unisys spokesperson in Philadelphia.andP;  &quot;And those applicationsare on multiple, diverse systems.andP;  Using Unix and a LAN, we are making thataccess transparent to the agent.&quot;andM;The system gives Australian Airlines easy access to all of its Unisys 1100,Unix and IBM host systems via a &quot;universal&quot; workstation providing multihostaccess across a single network.andP;  Australian Airlines has all its reservationsand operational systems on Unisys mainframes, its finance systems on an IBMmainframe, and its office automation and departmental systems are onUnix-type processors.andP;  The combined Unisys [LAN/PW.sup.2] platform providesaccess to all of these environments.andM;In stage one of this contract, all single-function terminals will be replacedwith the multifunctional [PW.sup.2] terminals.andM;&quot;That obviously creates cost benefits right away in terms of networking costsand terminal costs,&quot; said Murray Smyth, a Unisys sales manager in Melbourne.andO;The intelligence in the [PW.sup.2]s will be used to even better advantage instage two of the contract.andP;  It is at that point that the DBA will get moreactively involved.andM;The customer sounds enthusiastic.andP;  Barrie Devenish, manager of DataCommunications at Australian Airlines, said, &quot;The [PW.sup.2] LANs provide thefuture flexibility to satisfy as-yet-undefined user requirements in the areasof multihost access and distributed processing.&quot;andM;IBM's ARCHITECTURE SOLUTIONandM;All in all, as IBM's Zagelow pointed out, there are myriad approaches to theproblem of heterogeneous database.andP;  IBM has developed an overall plan.andM;As the SAA SQL policeman, Zagelow is responsible for SAA's distributeddatabase architecture and coordination of IBM participation in thecorresponding Ansi ISO standards activities.andM;&quot;The real solution,&quot; said Zagelow, &quot;isn't a tool or a set of tools.andP;  It'sreally a common architecture for data access.andP;  The first piece will bedistributed, heterogeneous relational databases--that is, a core ofrelational database managers conversing with each other.andM;&quot;The primary reason for that is that the technology exists--in fact, IBMdeveloped most of it--to make it work.andP;  The way that relational databaseswork with their optimizers and their catalogs makes it possible to distributebased on relational.andP;  So, this first piece is built around a core ofrelational database managers conversing with each other.&quot;andM;Zagelow emphasized the work IBM is doing with the RDA group and IBM's hopethat the RDA standard will expedite the heterogeneous solution beyond SAA toall relational databases.andM;&quot;The second piece of the puzzle,&quot; said Zagelow, &quot;will be an overallarchitecture for handling asynchronous copies from other data sources intorelational databases.&quot;andM;According to Zagelow, IBM also addresses updating problems.andM;&quot;The key characteristic will be that the copies are maintained by the systemautomatically.andP;  You won't need a DBA to keep the copies up to date.andP;  For datasources where the amount of data is very large, it's possible to onlypropagate the updates that took place since the last time you had arefresh--again under system control.&quot;andM;This way the actual volume of data over the network is much lower.andM;&quot;Also key here is that the receiving data store is relational -- and thecommon denominator is SQL.andM;&quot;SQL is critical,&quot; said Zagelow.andP;  &quot;It's given us a chance for a standardinterface for applications requiring database services.andP;  Right now there aredifferences in the language, but that standardization is happening.&quot;andP;  (See&quot;Seeking an SQL Standard,&quot; p. 62.)andM;Zagelow said that SQL offers simplicity.andP;  It was simple enough for end usersto easily take advantage of the services that a relational database offers.andO;End-user tools benefit from SQL's simplicity also.andM;What this means, said Zagelow, is that SQL now becomes the standard windowinto enterprise data.andM;SELECTIVITY IS KEYandM;Another important point is the selectivity of SQL, said Zagelow.andP;  It allows alot of processing to occur on the remote system before any data flows back.andO;The network need not be flooded with data; only the records that theapplication is interested in need be brought back.andM;While Zagelow believes SQL is key to heterogeneous database access, hecautioned against its use for other than relational systems.andM;He said that while one can develop the mapping of SQL onto hierarchical, flatfiles and network structures, the use of SQL directly against nonrelationaldata stores may be very expensive in performance terms.andP;  That is because theoptimizers and the catalogs that SQL needs do not exist.andM;To summarize IBM's approach to heterogeneous database access, Zagelow said,&quot;We have a strategy of fully distributed relational databases with toolsbuilt on SQL and a strategy of asynchronous extracts into that SQL store forthe nonrelational data.andP;  Our overall strategy for data access consists ofthose two pieces.&quot;andM;The time for a particular technology has truly arrived when IBM starts toseriously address it.andP;  That was true for relational databases and it was truefor PCs--among many other examples.andP;  So, we can be well assured, the time forserious heterogeneous database access has arrived.andM;Bochenski is a high-tech freelance writer and DP professional who lives inBellevue, Wash.andP;  She has over 28 years experience in data processing,performing a wide range of consulting and data processing services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
