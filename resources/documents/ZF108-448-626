Rupert Goodwins bas somesuggestions of bow to ensure thatyou buy what you really need.andM;The advantages of having a networked development environment are almostunassailable, as soon as more than one programmer starts to work on aproject.andP;  Apart from the obvious benefits in sharing tools and libraries, andmaking sure that there's only one version of each file that's being workedon, local area networks also speed up backups and make it easier to keepeveryone informed.andP;  Most problems in project management aren't overlytechnical, but arise out of a lack of communication, and many of these can besolved, or at least minimised, with a good network.andP;  So what makes a networkgood? To an increasing extent, the hardware and software components can beconsidered separately, since the same process of standardization thatpersonal computers went through is well under way.andP;  I'll start with hardware.andM;EthernetandM;An off-the-shelf Ethernet card will come with various drivers which interfacewith off-the-shelf network software packages.andP;  Make sure that any card youbuy offers compatibility with Novell Netware, 3Com and the NetBIOS.andP;  Ifyou're intending to use the system with a popular application, such as PVCSversion control software, you'll probably find that almost anything willwork.andP;  Of course, some will work faster than others.andM;One of the figures that often gets bandied about when men in suits try tosell networks is the speed in bits per second.andP;  Cheap networks start atRS-232 speeds, using RS-232 wiring (The Invisible Network, and The $25Network, for example), while the latest standards talk about fibre optics.andO;Far from being the most important factor in the rapidity of the network,though, the raw transmission speed is about as much use as the 0-60acceleration times for a car that's going to spend most of its life in Londontraffic.andP;  The limiting factors are more likely to come from the interfacebetween the computer and the network adaptor, or the structure of thesoftware.andM;IsoLanandM;Network adapters follow the same rules as any other interface cards.andP;  Thefastest are bus masters - they take over the computer's data and addressbuses when a message comes in, and put it into memory as fast as they can.andP;  Agood example of this is the BICC IsoLan series of adapters, which are amongstthe few which bus master on both MCA - which is designed explicitly for this- and AT-style slots.andM;The next fastest category of cards are those that use programmed 1/0; this isthe most common sort of card, and relies on the host computer to issueexplicit 1/0 commands to read in the data.andP;  Last, and definitely least, arethose that rely on DMA.andP;  Direct Memory Access is similar to bus mastering, inthat the network card can place information into the computer's memorydirectly, but it relies on circuitry within the PC which suffers from beingslow, complex to use and has been known to harbour incompatibilities.andP;  Onlyon XT machines is it faster than programmed I/0, and then not by much.andM;StandardsandM;The different network topologies and hardware standards are still milesapart.andP;  The small systems standard is Ethernet cum IEEE 802.3, which defineselectrical and other interface specifications used by most PCs and almost allUNIX machines.andP;  You'll still need the appropriate software to communicatebetween Ethernet-equipped computers - the standard assures nothing beyond theability to physically connect machines together and have them exchangepackets of information - but it is a popular, non-proprietary option.andP;  TokenRing is common in the corporate environment, and at the low end of thenetwork market many incompatible, ad hoc systems mill around in mutualincomprehension.andP;  Each of these has its own benefits, though, which you willsee from reading the ads in certain magazines.andM;The RS-232 based $25 Network (cables, software and not much else) isperfectly capable of connecting two or more machines together, providingthey're all running exactly the same software, and some other, much faster,cheap and cheerful networks have the same limitation.andP;  The rule of thumb isthat if you're paying S200 or less per node for hardware and software, you'relosing compatibility.andM;SoftwareandM;Network software is another, and more complex matter.andP;  To the user, thedeveloper and his applications, any networked devices should seem identicalto those physically present on his machine.andP;  In practice, network softwaretakes up some memory, and if you're short of RAM on a pure MSDOS machine thiscan be significant.andP;  The amount of RAM lost ranges from about 15 KB for justMS-DOS file functions, to over 100 KB if you want full printer support, diskand printer sharing, and electronic mail.andP;  Also, memory usage varies fromproduct to product, and an increasing number make good use of extended memoryto leave the MS-DOS space as clear as possible.andP;  Some, like Lantastic, haveRAM on the adaptor board itself which houses some of the network software.andM;There's a big difference in the amount of memory required for redirectors andthat for servers.andP;  Redirectors - increasingly called workstations, just toconfuse things - are computers that run application software and rely on thenetwork to provide file, printer and other support.andP;  Servers do theproviding.andP;  Redirectors are redirectors, but there are two kinds of server,dedicated and non-dedicated.andP;  Dedicated servers just sit there and serve;it's not possible to run any other sort of software on them at the same time.andO;Non-dedicated servers can, in theory, be used as workstations as well.andP;  Inpractice, all the things that users do with impunity to their personalworkstations - three-key resets, writing or running dangerous software,changing configurations - can cause serious problems when that machine isalso supporting five or six other users.andP;  Dedicated servers have anotheradvantage: they can devote everything to the network.andP;  Most network software- such as Novell's NetWare, probably the commonest networking system in usein the UK - allows the choice between dedicated and non-dedicated servers tobe made during installation, with the tradeoff between flexibility andperformance decided by the installer.andP;  The difference can be verysignificant, since dedicated servers can have their disks formatted innon-standard (for DOS) ways that maximise their performance for networkingapplication, the processor configured for maximum efficiency and MS-DOScompletely abandoned in preference for a customised operating system.andO;Indeed, with Novell, you can choose anything from an XT to a 486-basedsystem, or even a VAX as a server.andP;  All the compatibility is provided in thenetwork interface.andM;There are advantages in having non-dedicated, DOS-compatible servers.andP;  Ifeveryone has one, then everyone else can share their disk drives, printers ormodems at will.andP;  Bear in mind, though, that such freedom does bringadministrative and security problems if everyone on your network can use yourhard disk, then every program they install can do so too.andM;Conversely, dedicated servers can provide mainframe levels of security.andO;Every file opened, every message sent, can be logged and the relevant detailsinspected by the system manager later.andP;  More importantly, people can beprevented from altering communal information; you probably don't wanteveryone being able to change your standard header files, let alone havingthe privileges to delete the entire system.andP;  Software such as Novell orNestar's Nex/OS 386 allows very fine control over the access each individualhas to disks, directories or individual files.andP;  Make sure, however, that yourchosen network operating system has the tools to give the system manager easyaccess to the protection mechanisms many networks are dangerously insecuremerely because nobody on site can understand the incomprehensible, butotherwise entirely adequate, security system.andM;ManagementandM;It's essential to appoint a systems manager for all but the smallestnetworks, and essential to have them properly trained.andP;  A thousand poundsspent on a three-day training course, plus the time lost while that person isout of the office, might seem like a large investment, but compare it to thetime lost if five programmers are twiddling their thumbs while the system isdown for a day.andP;  When computers are networked, the potential for expensivemistakes rises exponentially in respect to the number of machines involved.andO;Wherever you buy your server, make sure you take out a maintenance contract.andO;If the supplier doesn't offer a four-hour callout service, go to someone thatdoes.andM;Another way of mitigating the dependence a system has on its server, and thusthe potential for expensive mishaps, is fault tolerance.andP;  Once the provinceof mainframes, such things as disk mirroring, where a hard disk has eachoperation duplicated on a separate, independent unit, and power failuremanagement, where loss of mains power leads to a back-up supply kicking inand giving ten minute's grace for a controlled shutdown, are now available onmicrocomputer networks.andP;  Opus Technology provides disk mirroring in itsDatasafe PC,  and Compaq's  latest high-performance servers have similarpotential; Netware can also make this available with the right controllers.andM;Network VersionsandM;Most compilers, assemblers and program maintenance tools don't care whetherthey're being run from a networked drive by 30 people, or from a local harddisk by one.andP;  On a legal point, the licence often cares deeply, and it'sworth checking whether you need to buy permission to have your one copy of Cinstalled on the server where ten programmers have access to it.andP;  Usually,you do.andM;One consideration for developers of net-workable software is the interface towhich to program.andP;  With DOS, if you stick to the published Microsoft networkinterfacing specifications, you're assured of maximum compatibility but atthe expense of performance.andP;  OS/2 has networking ingrained at a deeper level,but some understanding of the underlying protocols does make it easier toproduce good multi-user software.andP;  However, for both these systems, you dohave to choose between following the official dictat rigorously and beingassured of upwards compatibility, or going for higher performance andchancing a major rewrite when the next version becomes popular.andP;  To someextent, this is changing.andP;  Microsoft, IBM and 3Com are now working to thesame basic standards, although UNIX inter-network compatibility is still notpart of that fold.andP;  Novell, by dint of their pre-eminence in the PCnetworking field, are still able to innovate and stay apart, so it still paysfor the network developer to understand and use the system that best meetshis needs.andM;Useful contactsandM;$25 NetworkandM;EQ ConsultantsandM;033484248andM;BICCandM;Suppliers of IsoLanandM;0442231000andM;3ComandM;3+Open and other productsandM;0628 890670andM;CompaqandM;PCs and serversandM;013323000andM;IRKandM;PCs, OS/2 NetworktngandM;01 928 1777andM;MicrosoftandM;OS/2 Lan ManagerandM;0734 391123andM;NestarandM;Makers of Nex/OSandM;0932 353911andM;NovellandM;Netware and Netware/386andM;0344869400andM;OpusandM;Datasafe PCandM;0737 765080andM;PolytronandM;Version control systemsandM;UK distributor.- Software GenerationandM;0462 422525andM;SPIandM;The Invisible NetworkandM;0734 844081</TEXT></DOC>
