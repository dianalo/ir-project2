The models used were (1) Abragam-Pound plusstatic interaction, (2) the Scherer model viewed as a non-stationarysequence of static interaction, and (3) our non-stationary extensionof the Scherer-Blume model. The calculations used detailed and quantitativeinformation on nuclear and atomic parameters characterizing the perturbationmechanism. A good agreement is attained between experimental data andcalculations.</TEXT></DOC>
