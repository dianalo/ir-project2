Subpart C of Part 422 describes the organizationand functions of OHA. It provides general information concerning hearingsby administrative law judges, review by the Appeals Council, and reviewby the Federal courts. For detailed information regarding the administrativeand judicial review procedures, the regulations found in 20 CFR 404.900<T3>et seq., </T3>416.1400 <T3>et seq., </T3>and 410.610 <T3>et seq. </T3>should be consulted.We are amending Subpart C as some of the information contained in thissubpart is no longer correct. For example, the current subpart refers tothe Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. As of January 5, 1979, the name ofthis SSA component was changed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals. See44 FR 17218 <T3>et seq. </T3>(March 21, 1979). We are making these and other similarnonsubstantive changes in Subpart C for reasons of consistency and conformity.Most of these amendments involve correction of_(1) OHA's mailing address,(2) several cross-references to CFR sections, and (3) out-dated terms andtitles. These amendments also involve_(1) deletion of a regulatory provisiondefining a ``presiding officer,'' a title no longer used to designate theOHA hearing officer who is an administrative law judge appointed pursuantto 5 U.S.C. 3105, (2) deletion of inaccurate provisions that concern beneficiaryreimbursement hearings under Part B of title XVIII, (3) updating the requirementswith respect to the dollar amounts ``in controversy'' for the various appealsconducted under titles XI and XVIII of the Act, and (4) the inclusion ofadditional categories of title XVIII determinations which can be appealed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to Subpart E</ITAG>Subpart E of Part 422 describes the procedures by which a person may requestfrom SSA information or records under the FOIA disclosure provisions codifiedat 5 U.S.C. 552. These Subpart E provisions supplement SSA's FOIA disclosurerules under Part 401 of this chapter and the rules under 45 CFR 5.1 <T3>et seq., </T3>which state what material may be disclosed.We are amending three Subpart E sections to shift the FOIA implementationresponsibility within SSA from the Office of Information to the Officeof Public Inquiries. In addition, the Director of the Office of PublicInquiries is now the SSA Freedom of Information Officer, and he or shehas responsibility for releasing or denying requests for information. Thischange was made because the scope of the duties and responsibilities ofthe Office of Public Inquiries made it the SSA organizational componentbest suited to handle the growing and increasingly complex workload ofdisclosure requests being filed under the FOIA provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policygenerally follows the Administrative Procedure Act notice of proposed rulemakingand public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the developmentof its regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act provides exceptionsto its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds thereis good cause for the dispensing of such procedures on the basis that theyare impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Wehave determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), good cause exists for waiverof notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures on thisregulation, since opportunity for public comment is unnecessary. The reasonswhy prior notice and comment are unnecessary are the following: First,most of the changes are technical in nature and involve nomenclature changes,the correction of inaccurate cross-references and other information, andthe deletion of obsolete information. Second, while we are specifying additionaldecisions under title XI and title XVIII that can be appealed, these additionssimply reflect statutory jurisdictional provisions which must be followedand public comment would have no purpose. Third, the shifting of implementationresponsibility from one component to another component within the agencydoes not require public comment, since this comes within the scope of agencymanagement and the rule provides information for the guidance of the publicas required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(A). None of these regulations reflectsimplementation of policy changes.Executive Order 12291The Secretary has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291, since these revisions are largely technical changes and donot involve any costs. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThese final regulations impose no reporting/recordkeeping requirementssubject to Office of Management and Budget clearance.Regulatory Flexibility ActWe certify that these regulations will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, because the regulationssimply involve the correction of terms, cross-references and other information,and the transfer of the FOIA disclosure function from one SSA componentto another. Consequently, a regulatory flexibility analysis, as providedin Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs; No. 13.802 SocialSecurity_Disability Insurance; No. 13.803 Social Security_Retirement Insurance;No. 13.805 Social Security_Survivors Insurance; No. 13.806 Special Benefitsfor Disabled Miners; No. 13.807 Supplemental Security Income.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 422</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, Organizationand functions (government agencies), Social Security.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dorcas R.
