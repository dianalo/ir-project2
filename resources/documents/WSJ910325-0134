Bulkeley   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><IN>DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   Intersolv Inc., the company formed by the recentacquisition of Index Technology Inc. by Sage Software Inc.,plans to slash employees and control costs quickly, Kevin J.Burns, chairman and chief executive officer, said.   Intersolv said it has already identified 65 &quot;redundant&quot;employees, or 15% of the work force, at Index Technology whowill be laid off. Mr. Burns said further cuts will be made bythe end of April. &quot;We're taking 45 days to rationalizepeople, products and assets. Anything that doesn't fit, we'recommitted to jettison in a one time charge and layoff,&quot; hesaid.</LP><TEXT>   Based on indicated combined annual sales of $72 million,Intersolv will be about tied for sales leadership withKnowledgeware Inc., Atlanta, in the market forcomputer-aided-software engineering or CASE, Mr. Burns saidin an interview. Intersolv will be based in Rockville, Md.,home of Sage. Index is based in Cambridge, Mass.   Mr. Burns, who had been president and chief executive ofSage, said that after the cuts and charge, he expects it willtake three or four quarters to bring Index's performance upto Sage's level.   &quot;After the integration period, we see the CASE market withsustainable growth of 30% or more for several years,&quot; hesaid. He noted that Sage has consistently grown 30% yearlyand earned 20% pretax profit margins and 13% after-taxmargins. &quot;We don't see any reason why the combined companiesshouldn't conform to those parameters,&quot; he added.   Mr. Burns said that the layoffs and other merger-relatedfactors will result in a &quot;substantial&quot; but undeterminedcharge for the current fiscal year. He declined to estimateearnings for the combined companies.   Last year, Index, the CASE market pioneer, reported a netloss of $1 million, or 22 cents a share, on 23% revenuegrowth to $46.7 million. For the year ended April 30, 1990,Sage reported net income of $3.5 million, or 55 cents ashare, on revenue of $26.5 million.   Mr. Burns said that Sage, with 175 people, aims to get$150,000 in revenue for each employee. He said softwareindustry personnel costs average around $110,000 a head. Bycontrast, he said, Index with 428 people has been realizingonly about $100,000 a person in revenue. &quot;The revenueforecasting and planning hasn't been as tough-minded as itshould be.&quot;   Many employees at Index, proud of their pioneering roleand larger size, were unhappy when the merger plan wasannounced last December. Recently, when Mr. Burns addressedIndex workers, a number of them dressed in black out ofmourning for Index.   The merger, completed last Tuesday, was valued at about$60 million. Index holders received 1.059 shares of Sagecommon stock for each share of Index.   Mr. Burns said that the company's CASE products arecomplementary and estimates that 20% of Intersolv's customersalready use software from both companies. Index is best knownfor Excelerator, a software tool that automatically designssoftware programs. Last year it also introduced a product forautomatically rewriting and updating old software. Mr. Burnssaid Index has been stymied in introducing a new version ofExcelerator that runs on networks of personal computers, buthe predicted that Sage's technology can be used to get thatproduct shipped by the end of this year.   Sage makes CASE tools that automatically generate softwarecode from designs and also determine how to configuresoftware that is used on networks.   Stuart Woodring, director of software strategy atForrester Research Group, a Cambridge, Mass., market researchfirm, said the merger of the two companies &quot;signals asignificant change in the entire CASE business. It means thatsmall players can't make it anymore. We'll be centered arounda handful of big players.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
