When President Reagan first proposed the Caribbean BasinInitiative in 1982, the region was suffering from low exportearnings, declining commodity prices, stagnant productivity anddried-up private investment, said Elliott Abrams, assistantsecretary of state for inter-American affairs.   ``Now, only five years later, CBI countries are turning theireconomies around,'' Abrams told the region's leaders Friday at the12th annual Miami Conference on the Caribbean.   Abrams blamed the 30 percent decline in export earnings onfalling oil prices, and said that aside from oil, ``exports from theregion have been growing.''   Although Caribbean and Central American nations have long beencritical of lowered U.S. import quotas for such traditional regionalexports as oil and sugar, Abrams said Washington sees such cutbacksas vital to the program's success.   ``In the final accounting,'' he said, ``It is the growth ofnon-traditional exports which is the most important and the mostpromising outcome of the initiative.''   Area nations become more competitive and less economicallyvulnerable with broader export portfolios, such as fly-fishing luresmade in Guatemala, fine mahogany furniture in Honduras andinstallation of free trade zones _ creating more than 80,000 newjobs _ in the Dominican Republic, Abrams said.   While U.S. Commerce Department figures show $1.5 billion has beeninvested in Caribbean Basin countries since the program started,continued expansion will depend on efforts towards ``long-term,self-sustaining economic growth,'' Abrams said.   Abrams also credited the program with fostering democracy in theregion.   ``The Caribbean of the 1980s has been marked by smooth democratictransitions through open elections,'' Abrams said on the final dayof the conference.   President Reagan, in a telephoned message to the conference,agreed.   ``Today, freely elected democratic governments are in power invirtually all countries in the region,'' Reagan said in the callfrom Washington. ``Through regional cooperation, a totalitarianregime was ousted in Grenada, and there are now four thrivingdemocracies in Central America.''   Reagan attributed regional economic growth to the initiative andeconomic reforms undertaken by nations in the region.   ``The economic and political achievements of the region over thepast eight years do not bear the label `Made in the USA,''' Reagansaid. ``These changes were made by the Americas _ all the Americas.''   Another vote of confidence in the program came from DominicanPrime Minister Eugenia Charles, who also addressed the conference.   ``Anyone who says CBI was a case of U.S. designs being pusheddown our throats either doesn't know what he's talking about _ orwasn't there,'' Charles said.</TEXT></DOC>
