Films grown directly onSi(100) contained substantial concentrations of dislocations, stackingfaults and antiphase boundaries (APB); those on {alpha}-SiC(0001) containeddouble positioning boundaries. Both the APBs and the double positioningboundaries were eliminated by using off-axis orientations of the respectivesubstrates. Films produced on Si(100) have also been doped during growthand via ion implantation with B or Al (p-type) or P or N (n-type) atLN, room and elevated temperatures. Results from the former procedureshowed the ionized dopant/total dopant concentration ratios for N, P,B and Al to be 0.1, 0.2, 0.002 and 0.01, respectively. The solubilitylimits of N, P and B at 1660K were determined to be -- 2E20, 1E18 and8E18 cm/sup -3/, respectively; that of A1 exceeds 2E19 cm/sup -3/. Hightemperature ion implantation coupled with dynamic and post annealingresulted in a markedly reduced defect concentration relative to thatobserved in similar research at the lower temperatures. Schottky diodes,p-n junctions, and MOSFET devices have been fabricated. The p-n junctionshave been characteristics of insulators containing free carriers anddeep level traps. The MOSFETs show very good I-V characteristics up to673K, but have not been optimized.</TEXT></DOC>
