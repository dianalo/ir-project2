For purposes of this investigation,the following programs are preliminarily found to confer subsidies:Federal Programsandbullet; Debenture Guarantees Provided to Sydney Steel Corporation (Sysco).andbullet; Forgiven Wharf Loan.andbullet; Regional Development Incentives Program.andbullet; Certain Investment Tax Credits.Joint Federal-Provincial Programsandbullet; General Development Agreements.andbullet; Ecomomic and Regional Development Agreements.Provincial Programsandbullet; Operating Grants Provided to Sysco.andbullet; Long-Term Loan Guarantees Provided to Sysco.andbullet; Equity Infusions Provided to Sysco.We preliminarily determine the estimated net subsidy to be 103.55 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for all manufacturers, producers or exporters in Canadaof steel rail, except Algoma, which is excluded from this preliminary determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the publication of the Notice of Initiation in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 41394, October 21, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On October 27, 1988, we presented a questionnaireto the Government of Canada in Washington, DC, concerning petitioner'sallegations. On November 17, 1988, petitioner filed a request that thepreliminary determination be postponed. Pursuant to section 703(c)(1)(A)of the Act, we postponed the preliminary determination to no later thanFebruary 23, 1989 (53 FR 49582, December 8, 1988).On December 8, 1988, we received responses from the Government of Canada(GOC), the Provincial Governments of Nova Scotia (GONS) and Ontario, Syscoand Algoma. The response of the GOC listed five non-producer exportersof steel rail to the United States: Grand Valley Steel Ltd., Nortrack Ltd.,Sessenwein Inc., C.P. Rail Ltd. and Bernard Railtrack Export Inc. We requestedthat these exporters answer the original questionnaire.On December 23, 1988, we delivered a supplemental/deficiency questionnaireto the GOC. On January 13, 1989, we received responses from the GOC, GONS,and the Government of Ontario to the supplemental/deficiency questionnaires,and responses to the original questionnaire from the following three non-producerexporters: Grand Valley Steel Ltd., Nortrack Ltd. and Sessenwein Inc. OnJanuary 18, 1989, we received responses to our supplemental/deficiencyquestionnaire from Algoma, Sysco and Algoma Central Railway.On February 10, 1989, we delivered an additional supplemental/deficiencyquestionnaire to the GOC requesting further information from the GOC, GONSand Sysco. On February 17, 1989, we received responses from the GONS andSysco to this questionnaire. On February 21, 1989, we received the responsefrom the GOC.On February 21, 1989, we also received a response to our original questionnairefrom C.P. Rail Ltd., the fourth non-producer exporter of steel rail. Wehave not received a response from Bernard Railtrack Export Inc., the remainingnon-producer exporter of steel rail.On January 17, 1989, we received further subsidy program allegations frompetitioner. We declined to initiate an investigation on these additionalprograms and have informed all interested parties of our decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The products covered by this investigation are new steel rail, except lightrail, currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 7302.10.1020, 7302.101.1040,7302.10.5000, and 8548.00.0000.Steel rail, whether of carbon, high carbon, alloy or other quality steel,includes but is not limited to, standard rails, all main line sections(over 60 pounds per yard), heat-treated or head-hardened (premium) rails,transit rails, contact rail (or ``third rail'') and crane rails. Railsare used by the railroad industry, by rapid transit lines, by subways,in mines and in industrial applications.Specifically excluded from this investigation are light rails which are60 pounds or less per yard. Also excluded are relay rails which are usedrails taken up from a primary railroad track and relaid in a railroad yardor on a secondary track.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which weare measuring subsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1987 forAlgoma and April 1, 1987-March 30, 1988 for Sysco. These review periodscorrespond to the respective companies' fiscal years. Normally, we wouldselect the calendar year as the review period for all companies if thecompanies under investigation had different fiscal years. We have chosenSysco's fiscal year as that company's review period in order to measuremore accurately the subsidies received over time, which have been reportedto the Department on a fiscal year basis. Petitioner alleged that Sysco is unequityworthy and uncreditworthy. Wehave consistently held that the government provision of equity does not<T3>per se</T3> confer a subsidy. Government equity purchases bestow countervailablebenefits only when they occur on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.When there is no market-determined price for equity, it is necessary todetermine whether the company was a reasonable commercial investment or,in other words, whether the company was ``equityworthy.'' The GONS is the sole owner of Sysco, which it purchased in 1968. Syscohas never issued shares; therefore, we must determine whether Sysco wasequityworthy in each instance when the GONS made an equity infusion. Wedo not reach the question of whether Sysco was equityworthy in 1968. Theinitial purchase of Sysco by the GONS occurred prior to the 15 year periodin which we are examining all the financial assistance received by Syscowhich may have benefited the company during the review period. We are using15 years because it represents the average useful life of assets in thesteel industry as determined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's 1977Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System. (Use of the IRS tables is inaccordance with past practice and is described in detail in the ``SubsidiesAppendix'' attached to the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel and Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina,</T3>49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984 (<T3>Subsidies Appendix</T3>).) Although Sysco's equityworthiness in 1968 and the GONS's equity infusionin 1968 will not be examined, the GONS made additional equity infusionsinto Sysco in the period 1977-1988. Therefore, we have preliminarily determinedSysco's equityworthiness in each year in which it received equity capitalfrom the GONS. A company is considered unequityworthy if it is deemed unable to generatea reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. In makingour equityworthiness determinations, we assess the company's current andpast financial health, as reflected in various financial indicators takenfrom its financial statements, and where appropriate, internal accounts.The indicators we examine include the following ratios: rate of returnon equity, gross margin to sales, financial expenses to sales, the currentratio and debt to equity. We give great weight to the company's recentrate of return on equity as an indication of financial health and prospects.Based on the factors described above, we preliminarily determine that Syscowas unequityworthy in each year in which it received an equity infusionin the period from 1977-1988. Petitioner's other broad allegation is that Sysco is uncreditworthy. Weconsider a company creditworthy if it appears that it will have sufficientrevenues or resources to meet its costs and fixed financial obligations,absent government intervention. Like our equityworthiness test, to determinethe creditworthiness of a company we analyze the company's present andpast health, as reflected in various financial indicators calculated fromits financial statements. We give great weight to the company's recentpast and present ability to meet its financial cost obligations with itscash flow. Based on an analysis of the factors described above, we preliminarilydetermine Sysco to be uncreditworthy for the period from 1973 to 1988.We have preliminarily determined that Sysco is uncreditworthy despite thefact that it has received financing from private commercial sources. Weare discounting the importance of such financing because it appears thatSysco would not have recieved this financing but for the guarantees providedby the GOC and the GONS. With respect to the calculations of benefits from grants and governmentloan and debenture guarantees received by Sysco, we used as the discountrate for allocating the benefits over time the benchmark interest ratecalculated for purposes of analyzing the interest rate on Sysco's debenturesand loans which were guaranteed by either the federal or provincial government(see sections I.A.1. and I.C.2.). We were unable to use Sysco's weightedcost of capital, which is our preferred method of deriving the discountrate, for the following reasons. In the years 1973-1976, we do not haveinformation on the national average rate of return on equity. In the years1977-1988, either Sysco's equity as a percent of total capitalization wasnegative or Sysco's capitalization in its entirety was negative. Consequently,we could not meaningfully employ our weighted cost of capital formula.Sysco received grants or equity infusions, which we are treating as grants(see section I.C.3.), in every year during the period 1974-1988. In accordancewith past practice (see <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Oil Country TubularGoods from Canada,</T3> 51 FR 15037, April 22, 1986 (<T3>OCTG</T3>)), for all the programs which provided non-recurring grantsand for all the benefits received by Sysco which we treated as non-recurringgrants, we first determined if the benefit amount received by Sysco, ineach of the years in which the benefit was received, was more than 0.50percent of the company's total sales for that year. In every year, thebenefit amount exceeded the 0.50 percent rate; therefore, for all of thegrants and equity infusions received by Sysco, unless otherwise specified,we allocated the benefit over the average useful life of equipment in thesteel industry which is 15 years. Using the above methodology, we alsoallocated over 15 years, unless otherwise specified, the benefit from thegrants received by Algoma. Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a responseto an allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefitsunder a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program,and the Department has no persuasive evidence showing that the responseis incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary determination.All such responses, however, are subject to verification. If the responsecannot be supported at verification, and a program is otherwise countervailable,the program will be considered a subsidy in the final determination.As mentioned in the ``Case History'' section above, we have received questionnaireresponses from two producers and four non-producer exporters. Each of therespondent non-producer exporters has denied the direct receipt of benefitsfrom the programs under investigation. Therefore, the steel rail exportsof each respondent non-producer exporter will be subject to the estimatednet subsidy of the producer from which it purchased the steel rail. Asthe best information available, we are assigning the estimated net subsidyrate of Sysco to the non-respondent non-producer exporter, Bernard RailtrackExport Inc.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Programs Preliminarily Determined to Confer Subsidies</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers,producers or exporters in Canada of steel rail under the following programs:A. Federal Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Debenture Guarantees Provided so Sysco</ITAG>Petitioner alleged that the federal and provincial governments have providedloan guarantees to Sysco. (Provincial loan guarantees are discussed insections I.C.2. and II.A.). According to Sysco's questionnaire responseand its financial statements, in the years 1974-1976, Sysco issued twodebenture series; one was guaranteed by the Cape Breton Development Corporation(Devco), a crown corporation of the GOC, and the other was guaranteed bythe GONS. The series guaranteed by Devco was denominated in Canadian dollars;the series guaranteed by the GONS was denominated in U.S. dollars. (Bothguarantees will be discussed in this section). No fee was paid for theseguarantees.These guarantees were provided to a specific enterprise, therefore, wepreliminarily consider that they are countervailable for the followingreasons. According to the questionnaire responses, a fee would not havebeen charged for a commercial guarantee similar to the guarantees providedby the federal and provincial governments. However, we are skeptical thata firm in the same financial position as Sysco would have been able toobtain such a guarantee. Therefore, for purposes of this preliminary determination,we analyzed the extent to which Sysco was able to issue the debentureson terms more favorable than the benchmark financing.As described in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section above, we have preliminarilydetermined that Sysco has been uncreditworthy throughout the period 1973-1988.In the case of uncreditworthy companies, we assume that private lenderseither would not provide loans to such companies or would require a premiuminterest rate. In selecting an appropriate benchmark, we must formulatean approximation of the premium interest rate a commercial source of financingwould charge an uncreditworthy company (see the <T3>Subsidies Appendix). </T3>The first step in the formulation of suchan interest rate is to determine the highest commonly-available commercialinterest rate a creditworthy borrower would have to pay in order to receivea loan. This interest rate is the rate that would be charged a marginallycreditworthy company.The next step is the calculation of a risk premium. This amount representsthe difference in risk between a marginally creditworthy company and anuncreditworthy company. In previous cases (See <T3>Certain Carbon Steel Products from Brazil; Final results of CountervailingDuty Administrative Review, </T3>52 FR 829, January 9, 1987), we have derivedthis risk premium by examining the difference between <T3>Moddy's </T3>Aaa and Baa corporate bond rates and calculating the percentagethis difference represents of the prime interest rate in the United States.We have found that the risk premium as calculated by this approach is 12percent. If the financing is not in U.S. currency, this percentage is thenapplied to the prime interest rate in the country concerned to get a comparablemeasure of the risk premium in the local economy. The final step in ourcalculation of the appropriate benchmark for an uncreditworthy companyis to add the risk premium to the highest long-term commercial interestrate commonly-available to companies in the country in question.For the debentures denominated in Canadian dollars, we calculated the benchmarkinterest rate as described below. According to the federal government response,the Canadian government does not maintain statistics on the highest long-termcommercial interest rate commonly-available to companies. Therefore, forpurposes of the first step of our calculations we chose a surrogate interestrate using the following approach. If the national average short-term interestrate in the year the debenture was issued, as represented by the interestrate on 90-day commercial paper, was greater than the national averagelong-term interest rate in the year the debenture was issued, as representedby the average yield on long-term corporate bonds, we used the nationalaverage short-term rate in 1987. If the national average short-term interestrate in the year the debenture was issued was less than the national averagelong-term interest rate in the year the debenture was issued, we used thenational average long-term interest rate in the year the debenture wasissued.We added to the chosen interest rate the risk premium, which we calculatedaccording to the methodology described above as 12 percent of the Canadianprime rate. We used the resulting interest rate as our benchmark for thedebentures denominated in Canadian currency.With respect to the debentures denominated in U.S. dollars, we followedthe same general approach described above in constructing a benchmark.We used the rates on Baa corporate bonds as the highest long-term commercialrate commonly available to companies and 12 percent of the U.S. prime ratefor the calculation of the risk premium. Based on this methodology, wederived a benchmark for the debentures denominated in U.S. dollars.We compared the two benchmarks formulated above to the interest rates receivedon the two series of debentures issued by Sysco and found that the interestrates on Sysco's debentures were lower than the respective benchmarks.Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the guarantees provided to Syscoby the GOC and the GONS are countervailable.To determine the benefit, we calculated the payment differential betweenthe banchmark financing and the guaranteed debentures using our loan methodologyfor long-term loans which is described in the <T3>Subsidies Appendix </T3>and has been described in numerous previouscases (See <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Certain GraniteProducts from Spain, </T3>53 FR 24340, June 28, 1988). We allocated thebenefit over time using as the discount rate the benchmark interest ratesdescribed above. (We were not able to base the discount rate on Sysco'sweighted cost of capital for the reasons discussed above in the ``Analysisof Programs'' section). We then divided the benefit attributable to thereview period by Sysco's total sales and calculated an estimated net subsidyof 1.45 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Forgiven Wharf Loan </ITAG>According to Sysco's questionnaire response, in 1974, the federal governmentprovided Sysco with a loan to construct a loading wharf. In 1981, the federalgovernment announced that the loan would be forgiven. In 1982, Sysco removedthis loan from its long-term liabilities as shown in its financial statements.We preliminarily determine that the benefit provided by the loan forgivenessis countervailable because it was provided to a specific enterprise. Furthermore,we preliminarily determine that the outstanding principal and accrued interestas of 1982 should be treated as a grant received in 1982 because the loanhas been forgiven. Using the declining balance methodology and the benchmark interest ratedescribed in the previous section as the discount rate, we allocated thebenefit over 20 years, which represents the average useful life of a wharfaccording to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's 1977 Class Life AssetDepreciation Range System. We then divided the benefit attributable tothe review period by Sysco's total sales and calculated an estimated netsubsidy rate of 1.16 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Sysco. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Regional Development Incentive Program (RDIP) </ITAG>The RDIP was administered by the Department of Regional Economic Expansion(DREE) until its replacement with the Industrial Regional Development Program(IRDP) in 1983. It was established in 1969 for the purpose of creatingstable employment opportunities in areas of Canada where employment andeconomic opportunities are chronically low, namely the Atlantic provinces.The DREE offered incenties based on a case-by-case evaluation of capitalinvestment projects. Projects that could proceed without RDIP assistancewere ineligible. Assistance was provided in the form of grants or loanguarantees. Although the program was terminated in 1983, RDIP grants were providedto both Sysco and Algoma, prior to its termination. We preliminarily determinethat the RDIP grants are countervailable because the benefits are limitedto companies located within specific regions. Sysco received four RDIP grants; Algoma received two RDIP grants. Accordingto Algoma's questionnaire response, one of its grants was specificallytied to the production of products not under investigation. Therefore,consistent with past practice (see <T3>OCTG</T3>), we did not include this grant in our calculations. Algoma'sother grant was approved in 1972. To calculate a benefit we used the declining balance methodology. We usedas the discount rate for Algoma the national average long-term interestrate in Canada in 1972. (We were unable to use our weighted cost of capitalformula because we do not have information on the rate of return on equityin Canada in 1972). We used as the discount rate for Sysco the interestrate benchmark discussed in section I.A.1. On this basis, we calculatedthe benefits attributable to the review period and allocated them to therespective total sales of Algoma and Sysco. We calculated the estimatednet subsidy to be 0.03 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Algoma and 1.01 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Certain Investment Tax Credit (ITCs) </ITAG>There are a number of categories of ITCs in Canada and varying tax creditpercentage levels within some of the categories. Based on our previousexamination of all types of ITCs in Canada (see <T3>OCTG </T3>and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>51 FR 10041, March 24, 1986 (<T3>Groundfish</T3>)), we initiated an investigation on the following fourtypes of ITCs: (1) tax credits of three and 13 percent, above the basicseven percent rate which we have previously found non-specific, for investmentin ``qualified property'' located in certain regions of Canada; (2) taxcredits for investment in ``certified property''; (3) tax credits for largecompanies of 10 percent above the basic twenty percent for investment incapital equipment used for scientific research; and (4) tax credits forinvestment in transportation and construction equipment. Canadian tax law provides that ITCs may be subtracted from taxes owed,but if no taxes are owed (either because a company is initially in a taxloss position or because only some of the ITCs have been used to satisfyall tax liability), those excess ITCs earned after April 19, 1983 havea refundable, one-time cash value equal to 20 percent of the initial, facevalue of the ITC (40 percent for small businesses). According to its questionnaire response, Sysco, as a provincially-ownedcorporation, is not liable for federal tax. During and prior to the reviewperiod, Sysco made numerous capital investments and experienced large losses.However, because the company is not liable for federal taxes, it was noteligible for a refund of taxes under the ITC law. Algoma, in its questionnaire response, stated that it benefited from thethree percent tax credit, above the basic rate of seven percent, for investmentin ``qualified property'' because it is located in northern Ontario andthat it did not use the other ITCs under investigation. Furthermore, becauseAlgoma did not owe taxes on the tax return filed in the review period,it received a refund under the procedures described above.We preliminarily determine that the three percent tax credit, above thebasic rate of seven percent, for investment in ``qualified property'' iscountervailable because it is limited to companies located in certain regionsof Canada.To calculate the benefit from the ``qualified property'' ITC, we followedour standard tax methodology. Under our tax methodology, we allocate anincome tax benefit to the year in which the tax return was filed. Algomareceived a refund on the tax return filed during the review period. Therefore,we consider the amount of the refund attributable to the three percentin excess of the basic rate of seven percent, to be the benefit Algomareceived during the review period. We divided this benefit amount by Algoma'stotal sales for the review period and calculated an estimated net subsidyof 0.02 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>B. Joint Federal-Provincial Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Development Agreements (GDA)</ITAG>GDAs provided the legal basis for various departments of the federal andprovincial governments to cooperate in the establishment of economic developmentprograms. The GDAs were umbrella agreements which stated general economicdevelopment goals. Ten-year GDAs were signed with most provinces in 1974.Subsidiary agreements were signed pursuant to the GDAs. The subsidiaryagreements were generally between particular federal and provincial governmentdepartments and addressed economic development and infrastructure needs.These agreements established various individuals types of economic developmentprograms, delineated administrative procedures and set out the relativefunding commitments of the federal and provincial governments. Subsidiaryagreements were typically directed at establishing traditional governmenteconomic assistance programs, developing infrastructure, providing foreconomic development assistance for certain regions within the province,and providing financial assistance to specific regions, industries or enterprises.Three such subsidiary agreements were signed between the federal governmentand the government of Nova Scotia. Two agreements were specifically designedto provide assistance to Sysco. The third provided for the funding of industrialdevelopment projects throughout the province.We preliminarily determine that funds provided to Sysco under the firsttwo agreements are countervailable in their entirety because they providedgrants to a specific enterprise. With respect to the funds provided underthe Industrial Development Subsidiary Agreement, we preliminarily determinethat the portion of funds provided by the GONS are not countervailablebecause the assistance is not limited to a specific enterprise or industryor group of enterprises or industries in Nova Scotia. However, we alsopreliminarily determine that the portion of funds provided by the GOC arecountervailable because they are limited to companies in a particular regionof Canada (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the Province of Nova Scotia).With respect to the Industrial Development Subsidiary Agreement, we notethat although the agreement provided benefits to a wide range and numberof industries, an amendment was made to the agreement, subsequent to itsimplementation, providing specific funds for Sysco. We will examine thisamendment and whether it constitutes a discretionary governmental actionwhich provided a benefit to a specific enterprise.No assistance to Algoma was provided under the Canada/Ontario GDA or correspondingsubsidiary agreements.We calculated the benefit conferred by the grants using the discount ratefor Sysco referred to above (see section I.A.1.), and our declining balancemethodology. We divided the benefit attributable to the review period bySysco's total sales and calculated an estimated net subsidy of 24.72 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Economic and Regional Development Agreements (ERDA)</ITAG>ERDAs are essentially a continuation of the GDAs. ERDAs were signed withevery province and territory in the early 1980's. Similar to GDA subsidiaryagreements, ERDA subsidiary agreements establish programs, delineate administrativeprocedures and set up the relative funding commitments of the federal andprovincial governments.Two subsidiary agreements were signed between the federal government andthe province of Nova Scotia which related to Sysco. The first providedfor grants to fund the modernization of Sysco's operations. The secondprovided for the funding of economic planning projects throughout the province.We preliminarily determine that funds provided to Sysco under the firstagreement are countervailable in their entirety because the agreement providesgrants to a specific enterprise. With respect to the funds provided underthe second agreement, we preliminarily determine that the portion of fundsprovided by the GONS are not countervailable because the assistance isnot limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprisesor industries in Nova Scotia. However, we also preliminarily determinethat the portion of funds provided by the GOC are countervailable becausethey are limited to companies in a particular region of Canada (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the Province of Nova Scotia).No assistance under the Canada/Ontario ERDA was provided to Algoma.To calculate the benefit we used the same methodology described in theprevious section. We calculated an estimated net subsidy of 4.86 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.C. Provincial Programs_Province of Nova Scotia<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Operating Grants to Sysco</ITAG>The GONS has provided Sysco with ``operating grants'' to cover intereston long-term debentures and other operating costs.We preliminarily determine that these operating grants are countervailablebecause they provide funds to a specific enterprise. We also determinethat these grants are non-recurring grants because of their exceptionalnature and the uncertainty that they will continue. Furthermore, we notethat these operating grants have not been provided under any particularlong-standing provincial program. Instead, it appears from the informationin the questionnaire responses that the funds are provided by the GONSto Sysco according to the irregular financial needs of the company in aparticular year.To calculate the benefit, we used the same methodology described in theprevious section. The estimated net subsidy is 29.61 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Long-Term Loan Guarantees Provided to Sysco</ITAG>The province of Nova Scotia guarantees all of the long-term loans madeto Sysco by banks and trust companies. These guarantees were provided toa specific enterprise; therefore, we preliminarily consider that they arecountervailable for the following reasons. According to the questionnaireresponses, a fee would not have been charged for a commercial guaranteesimilar to the guarantees provided by the GONS. However, we are skepticalthat a firm in the same financial position as Sysco would have been ableto obtain such a guarantee. Therefore, for purposes of this preliminarydetermination, we analyzed the extent to which Sysco was able to obtainthe long-term loans on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing.We used as our benchmark for the long-term loans guaranteed by the GONS,the benchmark interest rate calculated in section I.A.1. pertaining tothe debentures denominated in Canadian dollars guaranteed by the federalgovernment. We compared this benchmark to the interest rates on long-termloans received by Sysco and found that the interest rates on Sysco's long-termloans were lower than the benchmark. Therefore, we preliminarily determinethat the guarantees provided to Sysco by the GONS on Sysco's long-termloans are countervailable.To determine the benefit, we calculated the payment differential betweenthe benchmark financing and the guaranteed long-term loans using our loanmethodology for long-term loans described in section I.A.1. We then dividedthe benefit attributable to the review period by Sysco's total sales andcalculated an estimated net subsidy of 14.11 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Equity infusions</ITAG>The province of Nova Scotia has made several equity infusions into Sysco.These equity infusions consisted of the conversion of outstanding debtto equity, and the provision of money for redemption of loans and capitalconstruction. As noted in the ``Analysis of Programs'' section above, wehave preliminarily found Sysco to be unequityworthy.We normally calculate the benefit conferred by government equity infusionsinconsistent with commercial considerations by determining the differencebetween the national average rate of return on equity and the rate of returnon equity of the company under investigation. However, Sysco's financialstatements indicate that the entire amount of the GONS's equity capitalhas been consumed. Therefore, the calculation of any rate of return onequity for Sysco would not be a meaningful measure. Furthermore, we believethat even if we could somehow calculate a rate of return on equity forSysco, the difference between Sysco's rate of return, presumably a negativevalue, and the national average rate of return would be so great that the``grant cap'' would be exceeded. We therefore treated all the equity infusionsreceived by Sysco as grants.We calculated the benefit from the equity infusions using the grant methodologydescribed in previous sections (see, for example, section I.B.1.). We dividedthe benefit attributable to the review period by Sysco's total sales andcalculated an estimated net subsidy of 26.63 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Sysco.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Confer Subsidies</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that the following programs do not confer subsidies:<T3>A. </T3><T3>Short-Term Loan Guarantees.</T3>The GONS also guarantees all of the demand loans made to Sysco by banks.We consider these loans to be short-term loans because they are listedunder current liabilities in Sysco's financial statements.The guarantees on these demand loans were provided to a specific enterprise;therefore, we preliminarily consider that they are countervailable forthe following reasons. According to the questionnaire responses, a feewould not have been charged for a commercial guarantee similar to the guaranteesprovided by the GONS. However, we are skeptical that a firm in the samefinancial position as Sysco would have been able to obtain such a guarantee.Therefore, for purposes of this preliminary determination, we analyzedthe extent to which Sysco was able to issue the loans on terms more favorablethan the benchmark financing.We used as our benchmark, the interest rate on 90-day commercial paperin Canada. (According to the GOC questionnaire response, this rate representsthe national average short-term interest rate in Canada). We compared thisbenchmark to the interest rates received on the demand loans received bySysco and found that the interest rates on Sysco's loans were higher thanthe benchmark. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the guaranteesprovided to Sysco by the GONS on Sysco's demand loans are not countervailable.<T3>B. Iron Ore Freight Subsidy to Alogoma</T3>Algoma ships sintered iron ore pellets from its mine in Wawa, Ontario toits steel mill at Sault Ste. Marie by rail on the Algoma Central Railway(ACR). The ACR also operates the Agawa Canyon Tour Train which is an importanttourist attraction in Northern Ontario.In 1986, Algoma reconsidered its use of Wawa iron ore because the deliveredcost of Wawa ore was not competitive when compared to the delivered costof ore from alternative sources. In order to make the delivered cost ofWawa ore competitive, Algoma sought a reduction in ACR's freight rates.Algoma considered closing its Wawa mine, if ACR did not reduce the freightrate to a competitive level. Such an action would have forced ACR to ceaseall operations, including its tour train operation.To preserve the continued operation of ACR, the Ontario and the FederalGovernments provided grants to the ACR. The grants were made under a jointfederal-provincial program established under the ``Canada-Ontario SubsidiaryAgreement for Tourism Development'' (COTDA), which is a subsidiary agreementunder ERDA. The purpose of COTDA is to stimulate the development of tourismin Ontario. Petitioner alleges that the grants received by ACR confer a benefit toAlgoma since ACR reduced the freight rate charged to Algoma after receivingthe grants from the two governments. Algoma states in its questionnaireresponse that since it could have bought iron ore from other sources ata cost lower than mining and transporting its own ore, it did not receivea benefit from the grants received by ACR. We preliminarily determine that the grants provided to ACR do not confera countervailable benefit to Algoma. Algoma has provided documentationsindicating it was able to purchase iron ore at a cheaper price than thecost of mining its own ore at the Wawa mines and transporting it throughACR. Thus, the grants received by ACR do not provide a countervaliablebenefit to Algoma.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>III. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not to be Used</T4></ITAG>We preliminarily determine that the following programs were not used bymanufacturers, producers or exporters in Canada of steel rail during thereview period:<T3>A. Federal Programs</T3><ITAG tagnum="81"/>1. Industrial and Regional Development Program (IRDP). The IRDP was established in 1983, replacing the RDIP. The program was designedto promote indistrial development in all regions of Canada through financialsupport in the form of grants, loans and loan guarantees. The IRDP programterminated on June 30, 1988. According to the responses, no financial assistanceunder this program was provided to the respondent companies under thisprogram.<ITAG tagnum="81"/>2. Loans under the Enterprise Development Programs (EDP)The EDP was established in 1977 and terminated in 1983. It was designedto assist individuals, companies and corporations to enhance productivityin the manufacturing and processing sectors of the Canadian economy. Accordingto the responses, the respondent companies did not receive any assistanceunder this program.<ITAG tagnum="81"/>3. Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) and PromotionalProjects Program (PPP)The PEMD was consolidated and restructured in 1987 and now includes theformer PPP. Support provided under the new program is either industry-initiated(former PEMD) or government-initiated (former PPP). Under the industry-initiatedcomponent, interest-fee loans are provided to industries requesting assistancein export market development. Under the government-initiated component,the GOC organizes and sponsors international trade fairs and missions.According to the responses, the respondent companies did not receive assistanceunder this program for sales to the United States.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Federal Expansion and Development/Northern Ontario (FEDNOR)</ITAG>FEDNOR, established in 1987 with a five-year mandate, was designed to promoteeconomic development in Northern Ontario. The CORE Industrial program,as part of FEDNOR, provides assistance through loan insurance and grantsfor various projects. According to the responses, the respondent companiesdid not receive assistance under this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Community-Based Industrial Adjustment Program (CIAP) Grants</ITAG>CIAP was established in 1981 as part of the Industrial and Labor AdjustmentProgram. It was terminated in 1984. Assistance under the CIAP was providedfor capital projects to commercial enterprises located in areas affectedby serious industrial dislocations. According to the responses, no assistanceunder this program was provided to the respondent companies.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Export Credit Financing</ITAG>The Export Development Council (EDC) was created to facilitate Canada'sexport trade within the framework of the Canadian Export Development Act.The EDC, a self-sustaining Crown Corporation, insures and finances Canadianexport sales. According to the responses, EDC did not finance or insurethe sale of steel rail to the United States during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Defense Industry Productivity Program</ITAG>The DIPP, administered by the Department of Regional and Industrial Expansion(DRIE) has several purposes. Among these purposes is the stimulation ofexports of military hardware and the provision of assistance to upgradeequipment processes and facilities to make companies more competitive inbidding for military hardware contracts.Algoma applied for DIPP grants for the installation of hot metal desulphurizationfacilities. DIPP funds were paid to Algoma in 1980 and 1981. We examinedthese grants in <T3>OCTG. </T3>Although the Department may determine that DIPP grants serveas export subsidies in other cases, we determined in <T3>OCTG </T3>that there were no conditions in the Algoma DIPP grant whichwere tied to export performance or which made the grant contingent on exports.Algoma has a large home market for desulfurized steel and products madefrom desulfurized steel. This DIPP grant benefits Algoma's entire production,and not exports alone. Thus, we preliminarily determine that this grantwas not an export subsidy.Although we have preliminarily determined that this program is not an exportsubsidy, we must still determine whether any benefits were received duringthe review period and if so whether this program is limited to a specificenterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. Consistentwith the <T3>Subsidies Appendix, </T3>we divide the sum of all grants received ineach year by the total sales of the company in the same year. Algoma receivedno other grants in 1980 and 1981. The calculated benefits in <T3>OCTG </T3>were <T3>de minimis</T3>;, i.e., less than 0.50 percent. Therefore, as in <T3>OCTG, </T3>we expensed them in the year of receipt. Because the DIPPgrants received by Algoma were expensed prior to the review period andbecause no DIPP grants were received by Algoma during the review period,we preliminarily determine that Algoma did not use this program. Accordingto its questionnaire response, Sysco did not receive any grants under thisprogram.B. Joint Federal-Provincial Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) Benefits to Algoma</ITAG>The MDA agreement is a subsidiary agreement pursuant to the Economic RegionalDevelopment Agreement between Canada and the Province of Ontario effectiveNovember 2, 1984. The MDA Subsidiary Agreement was implemented on June17, 1985 with a five-year mandate. Its purpose is to aid and encourageOntario's mineral industry. According to the responses, Algoma has notreceived assistance under the MDA subsidiary agreement.C. Provincial Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Ontario Development Corporation (ODC) Export Support Loans, OtherLoans and Loan Guarantees</ITAG>This program was established to assist in the development and diversificationof industries in Ontario. According to the responses, Algoma and Syscohave not received assistance under this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Provision of Electricity by Ontario Hydro to Algoma</ITAG>Petitioner alleged that the government-owned power company in Ontario,Ontario Hydro, provides incentive rates for large industrial customersin off-peak hours. According to the response, Algoma did not purchase electricityfrom Ontario Hydro.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Income Tax Exemption for Sysco</ITAG>As a crown corporation owned by the GONS, Sysco is exempt from the paymentof federal taxes. According to Sysco's financial statements, the companyhas incurred losses throughout the 1980s. As a result, Sysco would haveincurred no federal income tax liability before or during the review period.Therefore, Sysco did not benefit from its tax exemption during the reviewperiod.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the informationused in making our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of steel rail fromCanada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> and to require a cash deposit or bond for allentries of this merchandise, except entries by Algoma, equal to 103.55percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> Algoma is excluded from this preliminary determination.This suspension will remain in effect until further notice.Entries of the subject merchandise by all non-producer exporters, exceptBernard Railtrack Export Inc., will not be subject to suspension of liquidationand a cash deposit or bond equal to the estimated net subsidy if it canbe demonstrated to the U.S. Customs Service that the entries of the subjectmerchandise were produced by and purchased from Algoma.
