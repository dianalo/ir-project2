Jane Coulter, 202-447-7854.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Paperwork Reduction.Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.chapter 35), the collection of information requirements contained in thisproposed rule have been approved under OMB Document No. 0524-0024.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order No. 12291 andit has been determined that it is not a major rule because it does notinvolve a substantial or major impact on the Nation's individual industries,Federal, State, or local governmental agencies, or on geographical regions.It will not have a significant economic impact on competitive employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S. enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, it will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, PublicLaw No. 96-534 (5 U.S.C. 601).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>Not required for this proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This proposed regulation does not significantly affect the environment.Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required under theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</ITAG>This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.210, Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate FellowshipsGrants. For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule-related Notice to 7CFR part 3105, subpart V, 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, at which time theauthority to administer this program resided in the Agricultural ResearchService, this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order No.12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Purpose</ITAG>Under the authority of section 1417(a)(3)(b) of the National AgriculturalResearch, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C.3152(a)(3)(B)), the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to conduct acompetitive graduate fellowships grants program. The administrative regulationsgoverning the Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate FellowshipGrants Program are proposed to be changed as follows:Section 3402.6(a). Additional language is proposed for this section tospecify the requirement that if a fellow completes the program of studyearly (less than 24 months for master's degree or 36 months for doctoraldegree), remaining funds will revert to the granting agency.Section 3402.6(b). Additional language is proposed for this section tourge grantee institutions to take maximum advantage of opportunities forawarding fellowships to population groups underrepresented in the foodand agricultural sciences, particularly minorities and women.Section 3402.12. Additional language is proposed throughout this sectionto guide applicants in the content and format of the information they submitin order to facilitate the evaluation of proposals.Section 3402.14. The use of a faculty summary vita form is proposed sothat faculty credentials are presented in a concise and uniform formatto facilitate the evaluation of proposals. Currently, the majority of proposalsdo not summarize this information as requested in the regulation and thepeer review panel must use valuable time to sort through voluminous materialsto obtain the relevant data.Section 3402.15. It is proposed that any additional supporting informationincluded in the Appendix of the proposal be referenced in the nationalneed narrative so that peer reviewers can readily recognize the relevanceof documents attached to the proposal.Section 3402.19. Based on discussions with several peer panel members whohave evaluated grant proposals under this program, it is proposed thatthe weight factors associated with evaluation criteria a. and b. be modified.We believe this modification will attach greater importance to an institution'sbasic program of graduate training, yet allow additional credit for theinstitution which incorporates special features in an effort to enhancethe quality of its program. In addition, it is proposed that evaluationcriteria b. and e. be revised to provide further guidance to applicantsand to facilitate the peer review process.Section 3402.22. It is proposed that this section be amended to add Federalregulations made applicable to this grant program subsequent to the issuanceof 7 CFR part 3402.Section 3401.25. It is proposed that this section be amended to requirethe grantee institution to submit a <T3>Graduate Fellow Exit Report</T3> form for each student supported bya grant as soon as the fellow is (a) graduated, or (b) officially terminatedfrom the program. A compilation of the exit reports for the fellows supportedby a grant shall constitute the final performance report for that grant.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 3402</ITAG>Grant programs_agriculture, Agriculture Higher Education Programs (HEP)Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowships GrantsProgram.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 7, chapter XXXIV, part3402 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3402_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
