But authorities said booze on board was banned by most U.S.commercial shippers well before the Alaskan oil spill that happenedafter the tipsy skipper allowed an uncertified third mate tooperate the tanker.   ``The whole philosophy about drinking has changed. It's just nottolerated anymore,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Epler of the CoastGuard's crisis action center.   ``Any hand who's drunk aboard a vessel makes it unseaworthy,''said Carmine Guastella, who set up an alcohol rehabilitationprogram in 1977 for the National Maritime Union. ``This is a blackeye to the American merchant marine.''   Federal regulations that took effect in January 1988 prohibitcommercial operators from having 0.04 percent alcohol in theirblood. Drinking is also prohibited four hours before going on duty.   Authorities said Capt. Joseph Hazelwood had a 0.061 percentlevel nine hours after the Exxon Valdez lurched onto Bligh Reef inPrince William Sound, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oilMarch 24 in the worst oil spill in U.S. history.   Hazelwood, 42, was fired by the Exxon Corp., which bans alcoholon its ships, even to crewmen who are off duty. The captain wastwice arrested on drunken driving charges and his drivers' licensewas suspended three times.   Captains are required on their shipping license applications toreport arrests for driving while intoxicated.   Hazelwood was checked under new federal regulations that callfor tests after a major accident. Federal officials had troublefinding a test kit, but a Coast Guard corpsman used one supplied byExxon.   When asked by investigators what was the problem, Hazelwoodsaid, ``I think you're looking at it,'' according to a courtaffidavit. One crewman also said ``his balance was not good,''according to court documents.   The new rules about drinking followed 20,604 commercial marineaccidents involving drug and alcohol abuse between 1981 and 1986.Of the 1,114 deaths and 960 injuries from all causes during thattime, 17 deaths and three injuries involved drug or alcohol use,the Coast Guard said.   Hazelwood's case is the most serious since the rules went intoeffect.   On Sunday, the crew of the Century Hope called the Coast Guardoff Long Beach, Calif., because it feared its captain was drunk.Allen Jones, 58, of Ealing, England, voluntarily submitted to ablood-alcohol test and is being investigated for being drunk at thehelm.   ``We haven't found a lot of instances where commercial operatorshave been intoxicated. It's come up a handful of times,'' saidCmdr. Dave Wallace of the Coast Guard's casualty review branch.``It's not widespread.''   Drinking on the high seas were once intertwined. Old refrainstold about ``what do you do with a drunken sailor?'' and ``yo ho hoand a bottle of rum.''   In a tradition rooted in the rum-powered British navy, U.S.sailors were given a daily ration of spirits called a grog withtheir bread, salt pork and peas.   The practice was banned in 1862 when sailors were compensatedfor their loss, but a lament said, ``They've raised his pay threecents a day but stopped his grog forever.''   All booze was banned in 1914, when the blue-nosed teetotalerJosephus Daniels as Secretary of the Navy ended the custom ofofficers having wine in their quarters. He earned the bitternickname ``Grape Juice Josephus.''   Aircraft carriers still have brandy hoarded by doctors formedicinal purposes, and ships can still be christened with a bottleof champagne. But a Navy in which thirsty hands once swallowedalcohol-based torpedo juice during World War II is officially dry.   Federal regulations for drinking on pleasure boats are morerelaxed.   Pilots are allowed to have less than 0.1 percent alcohol intheir blood, although booze was the direct result of 158 deaths and135 injuries in 279 crashes in 1985, the Coast Guard said. Half ofall pleasure boating accidents are thought to be related todrinking, the Coast Guard estimated.   ``It's much more stringent for operators of commericialvessels,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan of the Coast Guard's publicaffairs office in New York.   ``A tanker that has the potential of creating a major oil slickis more serious than going around a harbor erratically. It canaffect an ecology or the lifestyle of a whole community for yearsto come,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
