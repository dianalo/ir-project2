Now, with the rapid approach of German unification, the WestGerman chancellor is probably the single most important voice inthe 12-nation European Community, and a far more important playeron the world stage.   ``It was still in good taste, even a few months ago, to depictHelmut Kohl as a man with limited talents _ as a provincialpolitician,'' said France's influential Le Monde newspaper.   ``Today, people are starting to suspect him of wanting to carveup his neighbors and dominate the continent,'' the newspaper saidSaturday.   Kohl firmly rejects such assertions. He says a unified Germanywith a combined population of nearly 80 million will serve theinterests of the European Community.   But there appears to be little question that his new, moreimportant role is one he relishes.   In Washington, it was announced today that Kohl will meet withPresident Bush at the White House May 17 to discuss the U.S.-Sovietsuperpower summit, which begins May 30, and German reunification.   During Saturday's summit in Dublin, Western European leaderssaid they ``warmly welcomed'' the joining of the two German states.The declaration reflects in large part efforts by Kohl's governmentto dispel fears about German unification.   The 60-year-old Kohl dominated the post-summit news conference,calling the EC's full support of German unification a ``historichour.''   After Kohl became chancellor in 1982, the frequently repeatedcalls of his Christian Democratic Union for a united Germany wereoften dismissed as fanciful dreaming.   Then came 1989 and the collapse of hard-line Communistgovernments across Eastern Europe. The political transformationincluded the downfall of Erich Honecker, Kohl's longtime nemesis asCommunist leader in East Berlin.   A little more than four months after the Berlin Wall began tocrumble on Nov. 9, East Germans had given a Kohl-backed coalitionfirm control of government in East Berlin.   Suddenly, Kohl's hopes were rapidly on their way to beingfulfilled, propelled by a powerful business community eager tobring East Germany into its economic fold.   But Kohl's rush to greater prominence hasn't come withoutcontroversy.   For several weeks, the chancellor rattled Europeans by failingto unequivically renounce German claims to lands awarded to Polandafter Germany's defeat in World War II.   He compounded his woes by seeking an apology from the Poles forthe mistreatment of millions of Germans forcibly expelled fromPoland after the Nazi defeat.   But things began to turn around when the chancellor traveled toBrussels on March 9 to assuage fears among NATO allies about Germanunification.   ``German interests must be taken into account, but also theinterests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in East andWest must be taken into account,'' Kohl said then.   While Kohl is riding high for the time being, speculation isrising about how he will fare in national elections scheduled forDec. 2.   Many West Germans are worried about the staggering costs ofunification, and Kohl has been unable to ease fears that a taxincrease will be needed to finance unification.   The decline of East-West tensions also may help the oppositionSocial Democrats, who have been at the forefront by criticizingarms buildups, espousing a kind of ``guns into plowshares'' policyfor years.   An independent poll in today's editions of Der Spiegel magazinegives Kohl a 58 percent approval rating. That is an increase of 4percentage points over a month ago, but way behind Kohl's SPDchallenger Oskar Lafontaine with a 63 percent rating.   Lafontaine was hurt Wednesday night in a knife attack by anemotionally disturbed woman but was moved out of intensive careover the weekend.   Kohl will take time out from a seemingly endless round ofunification meetings to deliver the commencement address at HarvardUniversity in Cambridge, Mass. on June 7.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Kevin Costelloe has covered Germany's place inEuropean and international politics since 1985 as Frankfurt NewsEditor.</TEXT></DOC>
