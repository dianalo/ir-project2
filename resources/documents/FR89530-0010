Background </ITAG>HUD's regulations at 24 CFR Part 965, Subpart G govern the operation ofthe Consolidated Supply Program (CSP) consistent with the low-income characterof projects as required under sections 6(a) and (9) of the United StatesHousing Act of 1937. The Department published a proposed rule on July 6,1988 (53 FR 25348) to eliminate the purchase agreement portion of the ConsolidatedSupply Program (CSP), under which Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and IndianHousing authorities (IHAs) purchase routine supply items with a value notin excess of the current Open-Market Purchase Limitation of $25,000.HUD received ten public comments in response to the proposed rule. Twoof the comments confused the types of contracts available under the ConsolidatedSupply Program, and indicated that the commenters interpreted HUD's proposedrule change as more sweeping than it in fact was intended to be.The two types of purchasing procedures available under the CSP consistof ``Consolidated Supply Contracts'' and ``Purchase Agreements.'' ConsolidatedSupply Contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids submittedby suppliers to HUD in response to formal Invitations for Bids (IFBs).The general availability of each IFB is announced in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3> (CBD). The Invitations for Bids are alsodirectly mailed to interested suppliers. Contracts are awarded to the responsiblebidders whose products meet HUD's specifications, and whose prices areat or below the average of all acceptable bid prices received for a particularitem. There is no dollar limit on the amount of an individual PHA/IHA procurementaction under a Consolidated Supply Contract. These contracts cover suchitems as refrigerators, ranges, doors, windows, bathroom and kitchen rehabilitations,floors, etc.Purchase Agreements are negotiated agreements that are awarded on the basisof proposals submitted by contractors to HUD in response to a Request forProposals. The general availability of each Request for Proposal is announcedin the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3>.The Purchase Agreement portion of the program differs from the CSP contractsin two important respects: HUD's solicitation of offers is <T3>not</T3> based on a technical specification, but rather on a descriptionof a class of routine supplies (e.g., janitorial chemicals, wall protectingchemicals, graffiti removers, etc.); and, there is <T3>no price competition.</T3> Responding vendors provide copies of theirpublished price lists and indicate any discount they will offer to PHAsand IHAs. HUD reviews this information and provides each vendor with aPurchase Agreement. These vendors may then market to the PHAs/IHAs by directcontact, or by mailing them their price lists or catalog.The Purchase Agreement (PA) portion of the CSP was based on the theorythat it would provide discounts for common, routine supplies not otherwiseavailable to PHAs and IHAs. Because PAs are not awarded on the basis ofprice competition or HUD-sanctioned specifications, individual PHA/IHApurchases are limited to $25,000, or any lesser amount required by Statelaw. As a further safeguard, HUD's CSP Handbook (7460.9) cautions PHAs/IHAsto ensure that the offered supplies meet their needs and recommends thatthey obtain competitive quotes for purchases above $1,000.Some public commenters opposed the proposed rule because they believedthe elimination of the Purchase Agreement program would limit the quantitybuying power of small PHAs/IHAs (less than 500 units). It is apparent thatmany of these commenters confused the Purchase Agreement aspect of theConsolidated Supply Program with the Consolidated Supply Contract.The elimination of the Purchase Agreement program will <T3>not</T3> limit the quantity buying power of small PHAs/IHAs. PurchaseAgreements are not awarded on the basis of price competition or HUD-sanctionedspecifications. Their elimination will not impair the ability of PHAs/IHAsto procure any replacement part or service available in the United States.Also, the existing group of vendors will continue to solicit a PHAs/IHA'sbusiness. By encouraging the participation of existing vendors <T3>and other vendors</T3> currently without purchase agreements, greatercompetition and lower prices may be available.HUD emphasizes that the procurement of major supply items will remain inthe Consolidated Supply Program, and that there will be continued availabilityof contracts and catalogs for refrigerators, ranges, windows, doors, etc.This rule will eliminate fourteen general maintenance products and servicesfor which HUD currently does not enter into competitive agreements.One commenter opposed the proposed rule, claiming that many small PHAs/IHA'sdo not have access to retail and wholesale outlets that have the extensiveinventory needed to meet the needs of the PHA's and IHAs. Also, those smallPHAs/IHAs do not have the expert knowledge to understand and implementHUD procurement policies. HUD recently issued regulations (24 CFR Part85) which simplified PHA procurement requirements. The types of suppliescurrently covered by purchase agreements would be obtained by PHAs usingsmall purchase procedures. These procedures are defined in 24 CFR 85.36(d)(1)as ``. . . simple and informal procurement methods for securing services,supplies or other property that do not cost more than $25,000 in the aggregate.''Competition for such purchases is considered adequate if price or ratequotations are obtained from three sources. Normally, such quotes can behandled by telephone without the use of formal written solicitations. Additionally,HUD is in the process of training its Regional and Field Office staffsabout procurement regulations. This information will be available to PHAs/IHAs.HUD believes that PHAs/IHAs are able to administer their own small purchaseprograms without the involvement of the Federal government. Small PHAs/IHAscan call or visit hardware or plumbing supply houses in larger metropolitanareas. (Note: There are no plumbing supply houses currently included inthe PA program.) Existing PA vendors are still available for price quotationsand competition will be introduced when the PHAs/IHAs solicit other quotationsusing simplified small purchase procedures.The Department, therefore, affirms its previous decision to remove thepurchase agreement portion of the Consolidated Supply Program.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the General Counsel,Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC20410.This rule would not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 issued by the President on February17, 1981. Analysis of the proposed rule indicates that it would not (1)have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Undersignedcertifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities because it merely reduces HUD'sinvolvement in the purchasing of supplies to develop, maintain, or repairbuildings owned or leased by PHAs and IHAs.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family</T3>, has determined that this rule will not have a significantimpact on the family. The final rule, which removes purchase agreementsfrom the Consolidated Supply Program (CSP) and reduces HUD's involvementin the purchasing of routine supplies to develop, maintain, or repair buildingsowned or leased by PHAs and IHAs, will have little, if any, impact on familyformation, maintenance or general well-being.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12611, <T3>Federalism</T3>, has determined that the final rule does not involvethe preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation, and doesnot have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisionsor on the relationship or distribution of power among the various levelsof government. The rule, which reduces HUD's involvement in the purchasingof supplies to develop, maintain, or repair buildings owned or leased byPHAs and IHAs, will not have a significant impact on the States.This rule was listed as item 1034 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708, 16744) under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and the Flexibility Act.The information collection requirements contained in this final rule havebeen submitted to the OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. Section 965.605(a) of this final rule has been determinedby the Department to contain a collection of information requirements.Information on these requirements is provided as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Tabulation of Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping, Final Rule_Changein Consolidated Supply Program</T4><H1>Description of information collection </H1><H1>Section of 24 CFR affected </H1><H1>No. of respondents </H1><H1>No. of responses per respondents </H1><H1>Total annual responses </H1><H1>Hours per response </H1><H1>Total hours</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Report on purchases (annual reporting) <D>965.605(a) </D><D>400 </D><D>2.0 </D><D>800 </D><D>2.0 </D><D>1600</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Report on purchases (annual recordkeeping) <D>965.605(a) </D><D>400 </D><D>2.0 </D><D>800 </D><D> </D><D>800</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total annual burden <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>2400</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 965</ITAG>Energy conservation; Loan programs: housing and community development;Public housing; Utilities.Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR Part 965, Subpart G, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 965_PHA-OWNED OR LEASED PROJECTS_MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Consolidated Supply Program</ITAG>1.
