(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   MiniScribe Corp., a computer disk company,has announced it will lay off about 2,000 people over the next fourto five weeks.   Q.T. Wiles, chairman and chief executive officer, said Thursdaythat about 240 employees will be laid off in the firm's Longmontplant and the balance will be in Far East facilities in Singaporeand Hong Kong.   He said natural attrition is expected to account for a portion ofthe overall reduction over the five-week period.   Wiles said the reduction was necessary because of lagging salesand overproduction.   The layoffs will reduce the company's workforce in Longmont to1,460 and overseas to about 6,500, said company spokeswoman JeanBoyd.   MiniScribe has reduced 1988 sales projections from $750 millionearlier this year to between $630 million and $640 million _ adecrease of 15 percent.   Pre-tax profit, however, will range from $55 million to $60million in 1988 _ about 75 percent above 1987 figures.   Analysts said makers of computer disk drives overestimated themarket this year.
