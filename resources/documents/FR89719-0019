This is a multiphased regulatory effort to controlTSDF air emissions. Proposed standards (52 FR 3748, February 5, 1987) developedin the first phase would limit organic emissions from equipment leaks atnew and existing hazardous waste TSDF and apply to valves, pumps, compressors,pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, and open-ended valvesor lines that contain or contact hazardous waste with 10 percent or moreorganics. As part of compliance with the proposed equipment leak standards,the facility owner/operator would be required to conduct a monthly monitoringsurvey of valves in gas/vapor or light liquid service using EPA ReferenceMethod 21 (contained in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60). If a leak is detected,the valve must be repaired within 15 days.The EPA estimates that once a monthly monitoring plan is in place, emissionreductions of about 75 and 60 percent can be expected for valves in gasand light liquid service, respectively. In some situations, there are potentiallymore stringent, technologically feasible controls for valves. Leaklessequipment for valves, such as sealed-bellows and diaphragm valves, whereapplicable, eliminate the seals that allow fugitive emissions; thus, controlefficiencies in such cases would be virtually 100 percent during the valveoperating life. However, EPA could not conclude that the use of leaklessvalves is an appropriate control alternative because EPA does not havesufficient information to understand both the applicability of this technologyand the long-term potential for reducing health risks (i.e., achievinglong-term emission reductions). Nonetheless, the equipment leak rules allowfor use of leakless valve technologies; monthly monitoring is not requiredif a leakless valve, such as a diaphragm, pinch, or sealed-bellows valve,is used to achieve a no-detectable emissions limit (i.e., 500 ppm abovebackground, as measured by Method 21, with an annual performance test).Because of the possible need for additional controls at some TSDF to protecthuman health and the environment, EPA is currently evaluating the applicabilityand control efficiencies achieved by these technologies in light of currentinformation and is requesting comment and information from manufacturers,TSDF owner/operators, and other industry users on such topics as leaklesstechnology advances, applicability criteria and constraints, commercialavailability, failure rates, valve lifetime, methods of determining valvefailure, estimates of emissions (leak quantities) from failed leaklessvalves, and other (alternative) leakless valve technologies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Overview</ITAG>The valve is one of the most basic, common elements found in a chemicalplant. Valves are available in numerous designs, including gate, globe,control, plug, ball, check, and relief, and are used for widely disparateapplications or functions (e.g., on-off service, throttling or flow control,pressure control, sampling, or no reverse flow). Most of these valve designs(check and relief valves excepted) have a valve stem which operates torestrict or to open the valve for fluid flow. The stem requires a sealto isolate the process fluid inside the valve from the outside environment.Typically the stem is sealed by a packing gland or O-ring to prevent leakageof process fluid to the atmosphere. Packing glands are the most commonlyused sealing mechanism for valves, and a wide variety of packing materialsare available to suit most operational requirements of temperature, pressure,and process fluid compatibility. Because of temperature and pressure limitations,O-rings are much less common as the sealing mechanism for valves in chemicalplants.With time and prolonged use, the packing or sealing O-ring in the valvecan wear and the valve can leak around the stem. To eliminate the (organic)leakage resulting from the stem seal failure, the valve packing and sealsmust be replaced or the valve body repaired or replaced. There are, however,some valve types and designs that have less potential for stem leakageof process fluids, i.e., valves with ``leakless'' or ``sealless'' technologies.There are basically three valve designs that to some extent can be consideredleakless; i.e., these valve types provide a 100 percent bonnet seal whicheliminates leakage around the valve stem. The three leakless valve typesare diaphragm valves, pinch valves, and sealed-bellows valves. Other technologiesare also reported to provide for zero stem leakage; these technologiesalong with sealed-bellows valves, diaphragm valves, and pinch valves aredescribed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sealed-Bellows Valves</ITAG>Instead of conventional packing of O-rings that eventually wear and leak,sealed-bellows valves use a metal (in most cases) bellows to seal or isolatethe valve stem. Because there is no path for leakage from this traditionaltrouble spot, sealed-bellows valves totally eliminate media loss due tovalve stem leakage. The bellows unit is a flexible metallic membrane (varyingfrom about 0.005 to 0.010 inch in thickness). The bottom end of the bellowsis welded around the lower end of the stem and the top end is welded tosome part of the valve casing. A stem anti-rotation device is incorporatedin the design to prevent torque from being applied to the bellows as thevalve is opened and closed. On some designs, a shield or shroud is arrangedaround the bellows to protect it as much as possible from damage by erosionand stress.As an assurance in the event of a failure of the bellows, for example byfatigue or corrosion, it is not unusual when dealing with hazardous mediato fit sealed-bellows valves with an additional back-up gland having conventionalpacking or seals or with a leak detector in case of failure, i.e., to havedirect, continuous monitoring of the valve for critical service situations.The frequency of catastrophic leaks to the environment is thereby reduced.<ITAG tagnum="84">Diaphragm</ITAG>The potential for leakage around the stem of a diaphragm valve is eliminatedby isolation of the valve stem from the process fluid by a flexible elastomerdiaphragm. The two major types of daiphragm valves are weir valves andstraight-through valves. The former has a dividing weir on the valve'sbody below which is a mounted elastomeric diaphragm. In the closed position,the diaphragm seats on the weir. The design of the straight-through diaphragmvalve consists of either a parallel, top-tapered, or venturi-pattern bodywith closure provided by a wedge-shaped projection of the diaphragm.Current literature indicates that diaphragm valves may be suitable forhandling corrosive and toxic solutions, as well as solids-laden liquids.If failure occurs, catastrophic release of line contents to the environmentis reported as not a serious danger if the bonnet is properly designed(although the bonnet will be pressurized if the diaphragm fails). Diaphragmvalves are not typically backed up with conventional packing around thestem.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pinch Valves</ITAG>The concept incorporating a double diaphragm with two flat sheets beingforced against each other to close the valve, has appeared in valves forservice with corrosives and slurries. This form of the pinch valve or clampvalve, is close to the diaphragm valve in design and also has an isolatedstem to prevent leaks.The basic components of the valve are a metal body, consisting of two flangedhalf cylinders bolted together, and two elastomer liner halves. In itssimplest form, it can consist merely of a length of elastomeric tube fittedwith a pinch bar mechanism. Usually the molded rubber tube is housed ina metal body which also incorporates the pinching mechanism.The literature indicates that pinch valves could be used for a wide varietyof applications. In general, it appears that pinch valves could be usedfor handling corrosive media, solids in suspension, and slurries, sincethe valve can be tightly shut off, and will even close when entrained solidsare present in the fluid.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Technologies</ITAG>Other technologies are also currently available which are said to be capableof eliminating stem leakage. The double-packed plug valve is one such technology.The double-packed plug valve involves a constant dynamic load on the plastic(teflon) packing. The load on the plug allows the plug to self-compensate,i.e., the plug is constantly forced down into the body taper to provideline shutoff. The new stem seal design employs an octagonal-shaped sealring and a pair of O-rings that assure positive sealing under the mostsevere operating conditions. This design could effectively prevent fluidfrom reaching the valve stem. Other double-packed valves are also availablethat are claimed to provide ``leakless service''. In these valves, thedouble packing is independently compressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>The EPA will use the comments received from this request to reevaluatethe control technologies available for reducing valve stem leakage, theemission control efficiencies achieved by these technologies, and the appropriatenessof requiring the use of these technologies for particular types of serviceat TSDF. Comments submitted in response to the following questions willbe useful in determining future EPA action on the application of leaklessvalves.
