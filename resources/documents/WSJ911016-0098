Some close their eyes, raise their arms, cry, mumble as ifin a trance. Some even hit the floor. But mostly, the severalhundred people attending service in this working-class suburbof Rio de Janeiro clap and dance as they sing, &quot;You changedme, you gave me reason to live.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Jesus, it seems, is changing more and more Brazilians andother South Americans. The scene, repeated five times a dayin this and other churches of the Universal Church of theKingdom of God, is taking place throughout Protestant templesof South America, underscoring the growing success ofevangelical Protestantism in a bastion of Roman Catholicism.&quot;Catholicism is being shaken,&quot; says Ruben Cesar Fernandes,research coordinator of the Institute for the Study ofReligion in Rio de Janeiro.   Analysts of religion diverge about the trend'ssignificance. Some refer derisively to evangelical movementsas sects and, pointing to recent financial scandals, saytheir leaders are exploiting the growing economic misery ofmany South Americans. But others, noting the growinginvolvement of Pentecostalists in politics and the broadcastmedia in places such as Brazil and Peru, say they could helpto imbue the region with a new work ethic as it embarks onbroad free-market reforms.   Whatever the case, the movement is a big enough challengeto the Catholic Church that Pope John Paul II is now on hissecond pastoral visit to Brazil, seeking to counter theevangelical surge. Speaking Sunday in Natal, the Pope decriedthe &quot;worrying growth&quot; of &quot;sects and new religious groups&quot; andurged bishops to &quot;occupy the spaces in which they operate.&quot;   That's a tall order, because the space they occupy isgrowing rapidly, making inroads even in such redoubts ofBrazilian culture as samba schools. Managers of the Mangueirasamba school complained just before the last Rio carnivalthat they were being decimated by a Baptist church thatopened up next door and prohibits its members from joining inthe Carnival-time licentiousness. Evangelicals have madeespecially strong gains in Brazil's slums, suggesting they'vehad more success in bringing their message to the poor thanLiberation Theology, the doctrine that endorses the Catholicclergy's activism on behalf of the poor.   Long called the world's biggest Catholic country, Brazilis becoming less and less Catholic. In a poll taken lastweek, only 72% of Brazilians described themselves as RomanCatholics, down from 89% in the 1980 census. Meanwhile, thenumber describing themselves as Pentecostalists surged to 6%from 3.2%, and traditional Protestants to 4% from 3.4%. Thisyear alone, the Catholic Church estimates 600,000 people willdesert it.   &quot;We're a consumer society, and consumerism has enteredreligion too,&quot; says Father Jesus Hortal, head of the theologydepartment at Rio's Catholic University. &quot;There aredisposable diapers, disposable pens and now, disposablechurches too.&quot;   Pragmatism largely explains the spread of evangelicalmovements, analysts say. While the Catholic Church focuses onsaving souls, many of the evangelical movements tackleday-to-day problems while making just enough doctrinarydemands to satisfy the Brazilian rage for mysticism. Theemphasis of many of these movements on demonology, exorcismand miraculous cures offers relief to the masses of peopleliving in misery and faced with a health system in collapse.   &quot;They offer a diagnosis, that demons are at work, and asolution, that Jesus cures, can resolve problems in yourfamily and bring you financial prosperity if you givedonations,&quot; says Ricardo Mariano, a sociologist studyingPentecostalism in Brazil. &quot;In a country where half thepopulation is illiterate and the health system doesn'tfunction, it's a plausible response to their needs.&quot;   At the service in Nova Iguacu, for instance, the pastordwells on how the Devil is at work everywhere. As he speaks,a group of clean-cut aides, wearing ties and white shirts,patrol the aisles and occasionally scream at followers tohelp them rid themselves of the Devil. Then come calls fordonations. The bigger the donation, followers are told, thegreater Jesus' help.   Many dismiss as charlatanism claims by leaders of theUniversal Church of the Kingdom of God that they've curedpeople of AIDS, cancer, blindness and other ailments. &quot;Tenpeople with cancer enter the Universal Church and 11 come outcured,&quot; scoffs Paulo Lockmann, a Methodist bishop. Butfollowers claim otherwise. &quot;I had an epileptic attack,&quot; says15-year-old Claudia da Silva, a former Catholic. &quot;I heardthat the {evangelical} Church cured so I went there. I got upand felt better. Only God could do this because I went to seemany doctors and I never got better.&quot; Though only one ofdozens of evangelical movements to have sprung up here, theUniversal Church of the Kingdom of God has received the mostattention because of its stunning growth. Started in 1977 bythe self-appointed Bishop Edir Macedo, the Universal Churchtoday is a multinational empire with about 800 temples and2,000 pastors in Brazil, branches in five U.S. cities, Chile,Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay, Portugal and Angola, andcontrol of a TV network and several radio stations in Brazil.   Last Saturday, the Universal Church gave a spectaculardisplay of its strength, filling a 200,000-seat stadium for amorning of prayer on the day of the Pope's arrival. Bannerswith messages like &quot;Jesus Christ is the solution&quot; floatedfrom the rafters, people cried as a group of yuppie-likepastors took turns leading the stadium in prayers and songs.There was only one conspicuous absence: Bishop Macedo. He wasthreatened with arrest if he showed up, in connection with avariety of charges over how he financed the $45 millionpurchase of his TV network -- including allegations by adissident pastor that it was partly financed by drug money --and of tax evasion. Yesterday, Mr. Macedo reappeared forquestioning by federal police in Sao Paulo.   While Mr. Macedo denies the accusations, analysts say thissort of scandal could stunt the evangelical movement. Butmembers of the Universal Church note that Christianity hassurvived persecution before. &quot;Jesus Christ wasn't understoodeither,&quot; says Odenir Laprovita Vieira, president of theUniversal Church and a federal legislator.</TEXT></DOC>
