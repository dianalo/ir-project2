HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The natural protein interferon, combined withstandard chemotherapy drugs, shows promise in controlling multiplemyeloma, a lethal form of bone cancer, researchers said Tuesday.   ``We finally have a leg up on arresting the natural progressionof the disease and producing patients who are alive at five years,which has been a rarity,'' said Dr. Martin M. Oken of theUniversity of Minnesota.   His research is part of a new effort by scientists to find arole for interferon by combining it with the drugs that have longbeen used to attack cancer.   Oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancerhas been weakened, but not destroyed, by medicines.   The work may also represent a revival of the fortunes ofinterferon, which has been on a roller coaster of public acclaimand disdain for a decade.   Interferon is a natural, hormone-like substance that, amongother things, helps regulate the body's immune system. When thehuman gene that makes this chemical was isolated, some expertspredicted many uses for interferon in eliminating cancer andinfections.   However, studies showed that when used alone, interferon hadlittle major impact on any cancer except an exceedingly raremalignancy called hairy cell leukemia, for which it has becomestandard therapy.   In the latest research, presented at the annual meeting of theAmerican Association of Clinical Oncology, doctors found thatinterferon plus chemotherapy produced complete remissions in 30percent of the 54 patients studied.   Such remissions, in which all signs of the disease are gone, arerare in multiple myeloma, and they are the first step toward curingthe disease.   In all, 41 percent of the patients had remissions that werecomplete or nearly complete. In an earlier study, only 11 percentof the patients reached this level after receiving chemotherapyalone.   In another study presented at the meeting, doctors from theUniversity of North Carolina showed promising early results oftesting interferon against chronic myelogenous leukemia.   ``These are interesting results,'' said Dr. James Griffin of theDana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``Response rates can beimproved and toxicity minimized by these recombinant proteins.''   About 11,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and 5,000 cases ofchronic myelogenous leukemia are found each year.   This form of leukemia can be effectively treated with bonemarrow transplants. However, many victims do not receivetransplants because no suitable narrow donors are available.   Dr. Howard Ozer and his colleagues at the University of NorthCarolina found they could reduce the outward signs of myelogenousleukemia and help the body replace defective cells with normal ones.   ``For the first time, there is a drug available that potentiallykeeps the abnormal (cell) clone under control and allows the normalclone to come back,'' Ozer said.   His team tested interferon on 112 people with this form ofcancer. They found that 70 percent of them improved, although it isstill too soon to know how the treatment affects long-term survival.   He said that interferon may have to be given for several yearsto keep the disease under control.   Oken said more study will be needed as well to see howinterferon affects multiple myeloma over time. However, he added,``I think it's a real advance.''   Typically, about 30 percent of multiple myeloma patients survivefor five years.   Just how interferon works against cancer is unclear. Ozerspeculates that it acts as a sort of negative growth regulator,shutting down bone marrow cells that produce cancerous blood cells.   Interferon is produced by inserting a human gene into bacteriaor yeast, which can churn out the substance in limitlessquantities. It is just one of several otherwise rare naturalchemicals to be made through genetic engineering.</TEXT></DOC>
