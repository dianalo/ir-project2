Food is checked by the Food Safety Inspection Service of theAgriculture Department, which analyzes meat and poultry; thedepartment's Agricultural Marketing Service, which analyzes eggs;and the Food and Drug Administration, part of the Health and HumanServices Department, which analyzes all other foods.   As a routine matter, the agencies can use only ``multi-residue''analyses _ methods that reveal the concentration of a number ofcompounds. Except in special cases, methods useful for detectingonly one compound are too expensive to use, the congressionalOffice of Technology Assessment reported.   There are 316 pesticide active ingredients for which theEnvironmental Protection Agency has established maximum permissibleconcentration of residues in food, or tolerances.   The OTA report said the five multi-residue methods used by theFood and Drug Administration can detect only 163 compounds.   Similarly, these methods can detect only 10 of 74 compounds withpending or temporary tolerances, 25 of 56 with no establishedtolerance and 92 of 297 breakdown products, impurities or other``pesticide-associated chemicals.''   The report presented less detail on the Food Safety InspectionService, but did say the four methods used there can detect about40 chemicals.   ``FSIS has identified 10 highly ranked pesticides it would liketo monitor routinely but cannot using its multiresidue methods,''the report said.   FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said the agency had not had a chanceto study the report and therefore could not comment. A chemist towhom he referred detailed questions did not answer.   USDA spokeswoman Karen Stuck said she was seeking comment fromagency officials.   Diane Baxter, staff scientist for the National Coalition Againstthe Misuse of Pesticides, said the lack of coverage in routinemonitoring ``worries us very much.''   She said fungicides of a class called ``EBDC'' whose breakdownproducts cause cancer and the herbicide glyphosate are chemicalsthat need routine monitoring.   Results from what analyses could be performed showed a lowfailure rate. The report said 2.5 percent of about 12,700 sampleslast year showed excessive residues, but the sampling was notrandom.   Samples contained a higher percentage of fruits and vegetablesthan the general food supply, and were biased toward food-pesticidecombinations known to yield residue problems.</TEXT></DOC>
