The announcement came on the same day as IBM itself announcedupgrades to its own aging but still dominant line of mainframes,which are the biggest kind of general-purpose computers.   The processors in Digital's new VAX 9000 series are the mostpowerful ever introduced by the company, five times as fast as itsmost powerful previous processors, Digital officials said.   Digital has previously focused on raising power by clusteringtogether several mid-sized machines. Tuesday's announcement is seenas a recognition that some jobs can only be done by single, bigcomputers.   ``It's going to do very well,'' predicted Howard Anderson, ananalyst who is managing director of the Yankee Group in Boston.``Digital always has great software and their users have a hungerfor power. The users keep getting bigger systems and they'll needthis.''   The new systems will be capable of work ranging fromsupercomputing jobs such as weather forecasting and oil explorationto business jobs such as rapid transaction processing.   Although Digital sometimes referred to two of its computers inthe 1970s as mainframes, Digital spokesman McLaren Harris said thatin this case, ``We feel comfortable in saying this is a truemainframe-class machine.''   Prices for the new systems range from $1.24 million for thesingle-processor model to $3.92 million for the four-processormodel.   ``They've essentially been naked in this particular category,''said John Adams, an analyst with Adams, Harkness and Hill inBoston. ``They're both refurbishing one end of the product line andextending the company's grasp into new territory.''   At present, about 70 percent of IBM's earnings come frommainframe hardware and software. In contrast, about 90 percent ofDigital's earnings and sales stem from its minicomputers.   Digital's introduction of a new mainframe coincided with IBM'sannouncement Tuesday that it has improved its own mainframecomputers and software. The centerpiece was Hiperbatch, a piece ofsoftware that IBM said speeds up by as much as 60 percent theprocessing of overnight, back-office ``batch'' jobs.   IBM's biggest mainframes are still bigger than Digital's. Theprocessors of IBM's new machines can hold up to 4.5 billioncharacters in live memory, about nine times as much as the maximumof 512 million characters in Digital's new computers.   IBM's Bernard Puckett said the announcement in New York had beenplanned well in advance, and it was ``truly circumstantial'' thatit came the same day as the Digital announcement.   Batch processing, an unglamorous aspect of computing, consistsof end-of-the-day work such as updating customer records at stockbrokerage houses, reconciling customer accounts at banks andcontrolling inventory in factories.   Hiperbatch was designed in cooperation with Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. Shearson's computer chief, Jack Owens, said it hadproven to be a ``silver bullet'' for the brokerage house, which wassqueezed for time by the emergence of global trading 24 hours a day.   IBM also announced new equipment and software for manufacturing;upgrades for its aging but still profitable line of 3090 mainframecomputers; and new security products, including a $1,205 pen thatcan detect forgery attempts.   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., is the world's largest computercompany, and Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the secondlargest.</TEXT></DOC>
