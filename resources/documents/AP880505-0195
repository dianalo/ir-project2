Democrats and Republicans on the House Armed Servicesinvestigations subcommittee charged that U.S. officials ignoredrepeated warnings and evidence of illegal Korean sales of M-16rifles.   The warnings came from Colt Industries Inc., the Hartford,Conn., maker of the M-16.   ``Our government continued to sleep at the switch throughrepeated warnings from industry,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky.   The hearing focused on a General Accounting Office investigationthat said the 1971 U.S.-Korean agreement, which banned sales tothird countries without U.S. permission and placed a limit on thenumber of M-16s Korea could build, was violated on both counts.   GAO Associate Director Joseph E. Kelley said many of theproblems stemmed from uncertainty over which government agencyshould have been in charge of the program. In large part, Kellysaid, oversight of the program was left to Colt, which was apartner in the 1971 pact.   Paul G. Gubbins, a former assistant counsel at Colt, said thecompany repeatedly presented U.S. officials with documentedevidence of attempted sales of rifles and parts and severalcompleted sales to Indonesia through intermediaries, but thatproduced little more than ``perfunctory inquiries.''   ``In every instance when Colt approached the government itreceived a polite hearing,'' Gubbins said.   ``In some instances, there was a perfunctory inquiry or politeadmonition to Korea. On more than one occasion, governmentrepresentatives wished us well in our efforts to resolve the matterprivately. But never ... was there any serious or meaningful effortto stop what was obviously happening.''   In 1983, Colt asked Edwin Meese III, the attorney general whothen was counsel to President Reagan, that the M-16 problem bebrought up by the president during a planned trip to Korea. Therequest was rejected, Colt said.   Glenn A. Rudd, deputy director of the Defense SecurityAssistance Agency, said the Defense Department, ``for better or forworse,'' treated the rifle program and the developing problemslargely as a commercial matter.   Colt sued the Korean government after the company stoppedreceiving royalties of $7 per rifle. That occurred in 1982 whenKorea turned over operation and ownership to a private company,Daewoo Precision Industries, of a government operated arms-makingplant Colt had helped build.   Colt officials told lawmakers they never wanted to get into theprogram, noting that they would have made much more money if theybuilt the rifles at their Connecticut plants and sold them to Korea.   But the Nixon administration wanted to give the South Koreansweapons-producing capabilities to keep it competitive with NorthKorea.   Gubbins said then-Deputy Defense Secretary David Packardpersonally lobbied for the proposal, and Colt eventually ``accededto the wishes of its own best customer.'' The Pentagon buys about80 percent of the M-16s Colt manufacturers.   Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, hasasked GAO to investigate other weapons-making agreements the UnitedStates has with Korea and other nations.</TEXT></DOC>
