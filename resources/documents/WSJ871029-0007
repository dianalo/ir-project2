The U.S. currency stood at 1.7365 West German marks in late New York trading, off 1.2% from the previous day and its lowest against the mark in almost eight years. The dollar also fell to a five-year low against the British pound and sank below 140 Japanese yen for the first time since April to stand at 138.48 yen.    Early Thursday in Tokyo, traders said the Bank of Japan intervened to buy dollars against the yen in an apparent attempt to prevent the U.S. unit from slipping below 138 yen. The dollar finished the Thursday morning session at 138.35 yen.    Traders said the dollar's drop reflects continued lack of confidence in the U.S.'s ability to narrow its trade and budget deficits.    &quot;The dollar will move lower until something substantial happens,&quot; Jack A. Kessler, senior vice president, foreign exchange, at Chase Manhattan Bank, said.    The currency's weakness spilled over into the bond market, where prices of long-term issues generally fell. Stocks also took a pounding early in the day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 60 points at the start of trading. But the stock market rallied later, and the industrials finished at 1846.82, up 0.33.    As many as eight central banks -- including the U.S. Federal Reserve, West German Bundesbank and Bank of Japan -- reportedly bought dollars in currency markets yesterday. But commercial bank dealers said the purchases were relatively small and appeared aimed only at keeping trading orderly.    &quot;The intervention seemed nothing more than a smoothing operation,&quot; Mr. Kessler said. In general, traders said they believe the U.S. and its major allies recently adjusted their target ranges for the dollar's value to permit the currency to weaken.    The Bank of Japan led off yesterday's intervention by buying between $200 million and $300 million in Tokyo trading, according to one trader's estimate. According to Japan's Kyodo News Service, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Thursday the Bank of Japan will intervene, on a coordinated basis, to counteract the yen's strength in the currency markets.    The dollar continued to fall Wednesday, however, until several European central banks were reported to be buying dollars during their trading day.    In addition to the Bundesbank, the Bank of England and the Swiss, French, Italian and Dutch central banks intervened to stop or slow the dollar's fall, according to traders.    In New York trading, the Federal Reserve was estimated to have purchased between $300 million and $500 million. For brief periods after yesterday's bouts of intervention, the dollar managed to stabilize or even firm.    One of those relatively stable periods was abruptly halted in afternoon New York trading after Jacques Delors, president of the European Common Market Commission, was quoted as saying that the U.S. is willing to let the dollar fall to 1.60 marks.    His assertion, in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, was denied by the U.S. Treasury. Nonetheless, barely half an hour after his remarks were reported, the dollar fell to its intraday lows of 1.7310 marks and 138.10 yen.    The dollar's tumble considerably increases the pressure on policy makers of the seven leading industrial nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- to announce a high-level meeting. Officials in several countries, however, firmly denied there are any current plans to do so.    In a tacit acknowledgment that the seven nations have renewed their determination to stabilize the U.S. currency, Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German finance minister, said intervention will be stepped up if necessary to counter financial unrest.    &quot;If necessary, there can be stronger coordinated international intervention,&quot; Mr. Stoltenberg said on a British television program. &quot;We all think it's very important to avoid a further fall of the dollar.&quot; He also said finance ministers and central bankers are in daily contact with one another because of the instability of financial markets around the world.    Meanwhile, the Bundesbank, the West German central bank, appears to be showing greater sensitivity toward international pressures for it to ease monetary policy, support the dollar and underpin global economic growth. The Bundesbank injected funds into West German money markets yesterday to keep interest rates down.    The dollar may come under more pressure from money managers and multinational corporations who think it has further to fall. Most foreign investors are hedging accordingly, while Americans are welcoming foreign-currency income streams. Although most of this maneuvering is generally done in options and forward markets, it can take an indirect immediate toll on the dollar.    &quot;The only (U.S.) investments left in the portfolios I run are bonds, and they are fully hedged,&quot; Felix W. Zulauf, a first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said. He said he began being bearish on the dollar in 1985, when the U.S. currency started its long descent.    At Nomura Investment Trust, a unit of Japan's Nomura Securities Co., Ken Ninagawa, chief representative in New York, said 90% of the firm's U.S. bond holdings are hedged, as is half the equity exposure.    On the corporate side, Juanita H. Hinshaw, treasurer of Monsanto Co., said &quot;the mood of the market is overwhelmingly bearish&quot; on the dollar. Monsanto has sizable foreign receivables, giving it some foreign-currency exposure, which she isn't hedging away. The logic behind this strategy is that as major foreign currencies rise in value, they will bring more dollars when converted into the U.S. currency.    The falling dollar &quot;isn't hurting us -- in fact, it is good for us,&quot; Ms. Hinshaw said. She said markets tend to overreact and that, on balance, the dollar has fallen too far. &quot;But I'm not going to stand in its way,&quot; she said.    At Union Carbide Corp., Craig Shuler, world-wide manager of foreign exchange risk, said the company is leaving its foreign currency positions open, &quot;given our outlook for a weaker dollar.&quot;    On the other hand, Paul L. Newhart, manager of money markets and foreign exchange for DuPont andamp; Co. in Wilmington, Del., said that company's policy has been to hedge its foreign currency exposure.    &quot;We don't want to expose ourselves to large exchange gains or losses in areas where we have no control,&quot; he said.    Currency traders at commercial banks yesterday were unimpressed with the level of central bank intervention and predicted continued declines for the dollar.    &quot;It looks like every European central bank was in, but they were buying small amounts; there was more talk than action,&quot; Liliana Nealon, vice president, foreign exchange, for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York, said.    The chief dealer at another New York bank with close central bank ties said central banks were far more active last spring, when the dollar fell to a 39-year low of 137.25 yen.    The chief dealer at another New York bank with close central bank ties said central banks were far more active last spring, when the dollar fell to a 39-year low of 137.25 yen.    &quot;I can recall when the Bank of Japan was buying $1 billion a day, but these (current) numbers don't impress the market,&quot; he said.    Market participants pointed to the dollar's decline yesterday as further evidence that the trading ranges believed set in the Louvre accord have been adjusted downward. The agreement, signed in February by the Group of Seven nations, is assumed to have established exchange-rate target bands for the dollar against other major currencies.    Although the bands were never disclosed, traders believe the range set for the dollar-mark rate was between 1.75 and 1.90. Speculators are expected to sell the dollar lower in the next few days until they find out where the bottom of the new range is.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.80 an ounce to $477.50 in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $476.45 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---   Peter Torday in London contributed to this article.    ---                    Late New York Trading                  Wednesday, Oct. 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
