YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court ruled that state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal Reserve System may own securities subsidiaries.    The decision is another victory for bankers who have been using regulatory decisions, backed by the courts, to widen the cracks in the half-century-old legal barrier between commercial and investment banking.    The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel upholds a U.S. district court decision last year that dismissed a challenge to a 1984 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regulation allowing the banks to operate securities affiliates. The suit, brought in 1984 by the Securities Industry Association and the Investment Company Institute, claimed that the agency's rule violated a part of the Banking Act of 1933 known as the Glass-Steagall Act.    That law explicitly prohibits federally chartered banks from dealing in securities and bars banks that are members of the Federal Reserve from affiliating with a company that is &quot;principally&quot; engaged in the securities business. It also bars any company that takes deposits, as banks do, from dealing in securities.    The securities trade groups argued that the provision barring firms that take deposits from dealing in securities prevented any bank from owning a securities unit. In an unsigned opinion, the appeals court disagreed, noting that &quot;we see no provision in the Act . . . that prohibits subsidiaries . . . of nonmember . . . banks from engaging in securities work.&quot;    If the law were to be interpreted as the securities groups argued it should be, &quot;the coherence of the statute as a whole begins to crumble,&quot; the judges wrote. &quot;The clear language of the (law) demonstrates that Congress intended to differentiate between the activities of banks and . . . banks' subsidiaries.&quot;    Of the nation's 14,000 federally insured banks, about 8,500 are chartered by state regulators and don't belong to the Federal Reserve System. Only a handful of those institutions currently have securities operations, according to an FDIC spokesman.    Last week the FDIC proposed easing the regulation that triggered the suit by removing the current ban against a bank and its securities subsidiary sharing an office or sharing a company name or logo. The proposed rule also would require securities affiliates to point out that investments made with them aren't insured by the FDIC.    A wide-ranging banking bill passed by the Senate last month includes a provision that would temporarily prohibit regulators from giving any new securities powers to state-chartered institutions that aren't part of the Federal Reserve System.    The ban, which would run retroactively from March 5, 1987, to March 1, 1988, is designed to give Congress time to decide whether banks should be allowed to deal in securities. The House hasn't considered the legislation yet. </TEXT></DOC>
