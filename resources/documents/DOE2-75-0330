The resulting nominal5-kW, completely magnetically contained thruster design has the potentialfor long operating life and an overall thrust efficiency between 60 and80% in the specific impulse range of 2000-3000 seconds, i.e., 50-100%higher efficiency than any existing plasma thruster. This novel thrusterconcept produces thrust by the expansion of hot plasma in a pair of magneticnozzles. Upstream containment of the plasma is achieved by a stable,'stellarator' like, magnetic-containment system. Plasma heating is accomplishedby a DC discharge between the two anodes located inside the magneticnozzle coils and a downstream hollow cathode located on a magnetic fieldline that passes near the center lines of the anodes. Almost all of thexenon propellant is injected into the discharge through the anodes. Theresulting thruster should, based upon the predicted performance, be veryattractive for future orbital Air Force electric-propulsion applications.</TEXT></DOC>
