Khodzhamiryan told the Communist Party daily.   The official said Armenia gets 87 percent of its freight,including fuel supplies, from Azerbaijan.   Since February, the two southern republics have been locked in abitter dispute about control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Themountainous territory is part of Azerbaijan, but its predominantlyArmenian population and the Armenian republic demand that it betransferred to Armenian control.   The Azerbaijani People's Front political movement called ageneral strike last week, demanding Azerbaijan reassert control overNagorno-Karabakh. Moscow moved in to directly administer the enclaveafter ethnic violence flared.   Cutting supplies to Armenia was not one of the stated aims of thegeneral strike, which was called off on Monday.   Pravda did not make it clear whether some Azerbaijani railworkers who took part in the general strike were still on a walkout,or whether the current rail paralysis was caused by an earlierstrike. The newspaper said that on Sunday, 250 trains had beenabandoned on lines leading to Yerevan, Armenia's capital.   The dispute between Armenian and Azerbaijan has killed about 100people in the past 18 months and caused hundreds of thousands ofpeople to flee their homes in Armenia and Azerbaijan.   Official Soviet newspapers have said the situation remains tense.   Pravda said the 19-mile road from the Armenian city of Goris tothe boundary of Nagorno-Karabakh is so dangerous that it is``impossible to pass even with a military escort.''   The national youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported onWednesday that there were few cars on even the main streets ofYerevan, the Armenian capital, and there were long delays in publictransportion service.   Pravda said gas stations did not have enough fuel to fill thetanks of even ambulances.   The lack of fuel and supplies was particularly threatening innorthern Armenia where workers are trying to reconstruct citiesdevastated by the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed 25,000 people.   ``The coming winter is putting people under the real threat ofbeing without shelter,'' Pravda said.</TEXT></DOC>
