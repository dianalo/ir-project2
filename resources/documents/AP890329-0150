(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's firstprivate spaceship blasted off Wednesday for a 15-minute sub-orbitalflight that sponsors hope will usher in the age of the U.S.commercial space industry.   ``It's the first of many, and we think it's the realbreakthrough,'' said Bill Vance, whose company, Space ServicesInc., launched the Consort 1.   ``I thought it was terrific,'' said Carol Lane, director of theTransportation Department's division that licensed the Consort 1.``It's a great beginning.''   The rocket's payload of six scientific experiments underwentnear-weightlessness for a little more than seven minutes during theflight.   The rocket rose 178 miles and fell to earth about 58 miles northof its launch pad at White Sands Missile Range.   Houston-based Space Services, which employs 14 people, is thesame company that pioneered private space exploration by launchingthe Conestoga 1 from Matagorda Island, Texas, with a dummy payloadin September 1982.   The company dealt with 18 government agencies to get permissionto launch Consort 1. It even had to obtain an export license fromthe State Department because the dummy payload landed ininternational waters in the Gulf of Mexico.   The Reagan administration, in an effort to open outer space toprivate enterprise, directed the Transportation Department toprocess and issue launch licenses and help cut red tape with otherfederal agencies.   ``It's been a six-year countdown. We've been in a long hold,''said Vance, Space Services' vice president for finance andadminstration. ``When we went up in '82, there was noinfrastructure for commercial launches to happen.''   Space Services plans similar suborbital launches in the nextcouple of years, and is applying for a license to be the firstprivate contractor to send a satellite into orbit.   ``In fact, we see the sounding (suborbital) rocket business aswhere we'll get a foothold in the industry and the orbital businessis where we'll make the big bucks,'' Space Services spokesman MarkDaniels said.   ``I think there's a big future for this,'' said Space Servicesmanagement analyst Jim Davidson.   The Transportation Department's 22-employee commercial spacetransportation department expects to process 10 launch licensesthis year, Lane said.   Five companies are offering private launch services, andFlorida, Hawaii and Virginia are considering offering spaceportsfor private companies, she said.   Consort 1 cost $1 million to $2 million. The rocket consisted ofa modified Terrier Navy rocket booster, with a Black Brant soundingrocket as a second stage. A 17-inch-wide, 11{-foot-long capsuleheld the payload. The entire vehicle stood 52 feet tall and weighed6,000 pounds at liftoff.   Consort 1's payload consisted of experiments that normally arecarried aboard the space shuttle as ``Getaway Specials.'' But theexperiments didn't need to undergo days of near-weightlessness.   The six experiments were assembled by the University ofAlabama-Huntsville's Consortium for Materials Development in Space,one of 16 commercial development consortiums sponsored by theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.   The payload included experiments designed to measure how liquidsmix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, howliquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness andhow finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to producealloys.   The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufactureof metal alloys and in construction of space stations.   University spokesman Dave Dooling said a preliminary look at thecontents showed the flight was successful.   ``The scientific team and the SSI team are both extremely happywith the results,'' Dooling said. ``We think this is an outstandingbeginning, not only for space exploration, but for spaceexperimentation.''</TEXT></DOC>
