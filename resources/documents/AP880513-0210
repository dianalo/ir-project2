WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leaders of a new political group formed tochallenge the Communist Party unveiled their platform Friday andsaid they planned to try to register with authorities but expectedto be rebuffed.   At a crowded eighth-floor apartment in northwest Moscow,organizers of the Democratic Union gathered to discuss their plansfor political action. At least a dozen uniformed policemen milledaround the building entrance but made no attempt to stop thoseentering or leaving.   The declaration of goals and principles followed a week ofmeetings in which the organizers said more than 150 Soviets from 27cities took part in deciding political stands for the party formedon May 7.   Yuri Denisov, one of the party's 15 Central Coordinating Councilmembers, said the Democratic Union would try to comply with lawsrequiring groups to register their activity.   ``We will soon make an attempt to register our party,'' he toldjournalists. ``But of course we expect problems with that and we donot expect to succeed.''   Another of the coordinating council members, Alexander Lukashev,outlined broad party policies, summing up the new group's goal aspresenting an ``opposition'' to the current Communist Partymonopoly on power and political thought.   The group opposes the ``Soviet occupation'' of the Baltic statesof Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and Soviet actions in EasternEurope that have helped keep Communist government in power there,he said.   The party has called for independent trade unions, and on Fridayissued a statement denouncing Polish officials' actions to haltindustrial strikes in the Soviet-allied country.   ``The Democratic Union comes out in opposition tototalitarianism of political parties,'' the group's statement ofprinciples declares as its first objective.   The party program sets out methods for calling elections andfilling leadership positions, and says funds raised by the groupwill be used for ``informational activity, agitation, printingcosts and organizational needs.''   Party activists complained that their first week was marred by``repressive'' and ``unconstitutional'' actions of the KGB, localpolice forces and the state-run press. The official Tass newsagency denounced the party on Wednesday, accusing the activists of``slanderous, anti-social activity.''   Dozens of participants were detained by police after theorganizational meetings last weekend, with sentences of five toseven days in jail handed down summarily to four of them, includingdissident magazine editor Sergei Grigoryants.   Grigoryants, who edits the unofficial magazine ``Glasnost,''remained jailed Friday night and no one had been permitted to seehim, the activists said.   Denisov said the party planned a political conference in thefall, but that details of that gathering had not been worked outyet.</TEXT></DOC>
