Health studies indicate that workersexposed to formaldehyde are at increased risk of contracting occupationalillnesses. This new standard will eliminate significant risks of thesedecreases among workers through its sharp reduction of permissible exposurelevels (PELs). The new standard lowers the PEL for formaldehyde at allwork places covered by the OSH Act to one part per million parts of air(1 ppm) averaged over an eight hour workday from the current 3 ppm andestablishes a short term exposure level (STEL) (i.e. exposure duringany 15-minute period) of 2 ppm. OSHA also has adopted an action levelof 0.5 ppm measured over eight hours. If work place exposures are maintainedbelow the STEL and the action level, employers may discontinue requiredexposure monitoring, certain employee training, and parts of medicalsurveillance.</TEXT></DOC>
