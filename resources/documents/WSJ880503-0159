Richard Gephardt's April 12 editorial-page article &quot;Fooling Ourselves About Free Trade&quot; came as a great shock and surprise to most Koreans. Even if one agrees with his notions about international trade, it is disturbing that a responsible political leader continues to mislead the American public with statements that have little resemblance to the truth.    To demonstrate how unfairly the world treats the U.S., Mr. Gephardt writes that &quot;an American lobby would be inconceivable in Korea.&quot; Not only do American lobbyists live and work in Korea, but many American companies hire Koreans to lobby for them.    The congressman accuses the Korean Embassy of &quot;vigorously&quot; arguing against a $48,000 K-car figure by &quot;concocting&quot; a lower figure. The latter figure actually was released by the U.S. administration and, we understand, was based on reports from the American Embassy in Seoul. The Korean government's figure was even lower than $29,000. In consideration of the American presidential election process, however, the Korean Embassy purposely chose not to contest or embarrass the very presidential candidate who was using inaccurate information to gain political support.    Before attacking the practices of a country, one should have a firm understanding and appreciation of that country's situation. It appears that Mr. Gephardt is not fully aware of Korea's economic situation or trade practices.    The question arises as to why Mr. Gephardt took it out on Korea. Korea is a developing country with a gross national product similar in size to General Motors' total annual sales, per capita income of less than $3,000, population density six times that of the U.S., a history of chronic trade deficits until 1986, a foreign debt that still amounts to one-third of its GNP and a high military budget that accounts for almost 6% of its GNP.    Korea does indeed tax luxury items, such as automobiles, in order to increase domestic savings, which in turn spurs investment, creates jobs, improves the standard of living and allows the nation to service its debt burden. With its scarcity of natural resources, Korea must export to finance imports. Simply put, Korea does not have the economic weight needed to attain the economic benefits long ago acquired by the U.S. Is it fair to force nations with unequal economic standing to share the same economic standards?    With its rapid economic growth, however, Korea has boldly pursued a market-liberalization policy by lifting import restrictions and lowering tariffs and taxes. The automobile market, for example, is now completely opened. Since last year, tariffs on motor vehicles were halved to 30%. The special excise tax on autos was lowered substantially to spur domestic consumption, which already has doubled in the past five years. In addition to joint ventures with Korean companies to produce automobiles in Korea, two major U.S. automobile manufacturers have just opened dealerships to market American-made cars in Korea.    Mr. Gephardt conspicuously fails to mention this positive aspect of our bilateral relations. The overall economic relationship between our countries benefits not only Koreans but also our American friends. Korea is now the sixth-largest market for U.S. products and is fourth for agricultural products. In 1987, U.S. exports to Korea increased by 34%, higher than the rate of U.S. export increases to any other major trading partner. In the first two months of this year, they grew by more than 50%.    Although certain problems do exist in the trade area, they surely can be resolved through cooperative and friendly negotiations. We understand what Mr. Gephardt is striving for. We have serious reservations, however, about how the congressman would attain his goals.    Yun Kil Yang   Senior Press Attache   Embassy of the Republic of Korea   Washington   ---   Rep. Gephart makes two mistakes. First, the government never will be able to pass a &quot;fair&quot; trade bill because what is fair to you is unfair to the next guy. How is it &quot;fair&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; the auto worker in Detroit and therefore raise the price of a new car for the guy in Topeka?    Second, the last thing this country needs is to have a pathetically bureaucratic and hypocritical Congress get its hands on a political football like an all-encompassing trade bill. We need less Congress, definitely not more.    Arthur Williams IV   Morristown, N.J. </TEXT></DOC>
