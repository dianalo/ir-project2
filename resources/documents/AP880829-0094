EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said similar action is plannedagainst at least three other cities by the end of this year unlessCongress revises the Clean Air Act.   California officials have said they expect little effect fromthe Los Angeles ban, which goes into effect Tuesday, because itcovers only large new plants that no one is planning to build inthe area, such as oil refineries.   A stopgap congressional ban on agency sanctions expires atmidnight Tuesday, eight months after it was imposed to buy time forCongress to produce changes in the law.   The construction ban against sources of 100 tons of pollution ayear is imposed for failure to submit adequate air pollutioncontrol plans showing compliance with federal pollution standards.   All areas were supposed to have met those standards by Dec. 31,1987. EPA maintains the law permits penalties only for failure tosubmit and follow plans. There is no penalty for failure to meetthe standards if an agency-approved control plan did not work out.   There have been several proposals to extend the compliancedeadline. But in the absence of congressional action, EPA has saidit intends to require new pollution control plans from the statesthat will have to show steady reductions in pollutionconcentrations.   There has been no agreement in Congress on what should be doneabout the missed deadlines, and when Congress reconvenes next monthit will have only about a month left in this year's session   Los Angeles is one of about 100 cities, counties andmetropolitan areas that the EPA says missed last December'sdeadline to meet health-protecting standards restricting levels ofcarbon monoxide and ozone, a major component of smog.   Ozone not only causes respiratory problems for humans but inhigh concentrations can injure animals and damage crops, forestsand even building materials, according to EPA.   It is formed in sunlight by a complex chemical reactioninvolving volatile organic compounds such as gasoline and emissionsof nitrogen oxides from transportation and industrial sources.   Ozone pollution frequently is worsened by the type of hot, dryweather much of the nation has experienced this summer.   Under the Clean Air Act, an area formally cited by EPA forfailing to meet the standards is subject to an automatic ban onconstruction of new facilities that would emit more than 100 tons ayear of ozone or carbon monoxide.   Before the moratorium was imposed, such bans were imposed on St.Cloud, Minn., Albuquerque, N.M., the Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnatiand various parts of Illinois.   The law provides for other penalties such as a cutoff of federalaid for air-pollution control programs and highway construction.Albuquerque was hit with these sanctions, although EPA has proposedlifting them.   EPA officials say Los Angeles, which lacks an agency-approvedplan to clean up its air pollution, is just the first of a numberof cities that will face construction bans with the expiration ofthe moratorium.   They said that by late October bans could be imposed againstVentura County, Calif., Chicago, and the northwestern Indiana areaadjacent to Chicago.   Waiting in the wings are 10 more whose air-quality attainmentplans are on the verge of being formally rejected by EPA, an actionthat would trigger construction bans.   They are Denver; Atlanta; Dallas; Cleveland; Sacramento, Calif.;Reno, Nev.; Bakersfield, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill.; Fresno,Calif.; and Indiana counties adjacent to Louisville, Ky.   EPA officials have indicated that Dallas may be scrubbed fromthe sanctions list because of improvements made to its cleanup plan.   They say there are no immediate plans to bring sanctions againstthe other cities and areas among the 100 or so that have approvedair-quality plans but still failed to meet the standards by lastyear's compliance deadline.   In those cases, the agency appears to be waiting to see whatCongress does.   Under proposals on both sides of Capitol Hill, the Clean Air Actwould be rewritten to grant more time to curb air pollution butrequire areas with severe, stubborn problems to take toughabatement steps, such as limiting vehicle entry to cities.   Advocates of a strong new law also are pushing for increasedcontrols on vehicular emissions, which isn't a popular idea withRep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and CommerceCommittee.   That panel is still trying to get a consensus on legislationthrough closed-door negotiations principally between Dingell andRep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who comes from Los Angeles and wants astronger law.   Committee sources, insisting on anonymity, say that after monthsof sometimes angry confrontations, Dingell and Waxman several weeksago finally got down to business and began serious bargaining.   They say, however, that the two lawmakers haven't even touchedthe acid rain issue, which is far more complex politically andgeographically because the East wants the Midwest to clean up itssmokestacks and the West and South aren't excited about helping topay for the expensive job.   On the Senate side, the Environment Committee has producedlegislation that has been ready for the floor for a year but hasn'tbeen able to get floor time principally because of opposition fromMajority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   The bill's acid rain provisions are a double whammy for Byrd.His state has a number of coal-burning power plants that would haveto clean up emissions, and West Virginia's huge reserves ofhigh-sulfur coal could be</TEXT></DOC>
