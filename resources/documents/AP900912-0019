A pre-dawn bombing damaged the offices of the governing NationalParty, but caused no injuries, police said.   The deaths occurred Tuesday and early today in the townshipsringing Johannesburg, where battles between rival black groups haveclaimed some 700 lives in the past month.   Worst hit was Tembisa, northeast of Johannesburg, where 25bodies were found, police said. Also, 13 people were killed inVosloorus, seven in Tokoza and one in Katlehong _ all townshipssoutheast of johannesburg.   The policeman was killed and three colleagues seriously woundedwhen they were ambushed with assault rifles while driving through asquatter camp in the Soweto township.   Also in Soweto, three blacks were killed when their yellow vanwas riddled with gunfire from AK-47 rifles. The attackersapparently mistook the van for a police vehicle, most of which arepainted yellow.   The blast at the deserted National Party offices in Pretoria,the capital, shattered windows and damaged computer equipment, saidthe party's regional secretary Danie Labuschagne.   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, which was carriedout with commercial explosives, according to police.   Extreme right-wing groups have claimed responsibility forseveral recent nighttime bombings, including attacks on otherNational Party offices. Commercial explosives were used in thosebombings.   White extremists have vowed to resist plans by President F.W. deKlerk to dismantle the apartheid system of racial segregation andshare power with the black majority.   Meanwhile, skirmishes continued today in the black townships.Houses and cars were set alight in Katlehong, Tokoza andVosloosrus, southeast of Johannesburg. Corpses remained on thestreet in several areas.   Women and children packed belongings into wheelbarrows andshopping carts and fled the area.   In Tokoza, armed men at a squatter camp said they planned toavenge an overnight attack by Zulus from a nearby migrant workershostel. Hundreds of the squatter shacks were burned to the groundin Tokoza and nearby Vosloosurs.   ``The Zulus are killing us,'' said one resident of the Tokozasquatter camp who was carrying an ax. ``Every night they come withguns.''   The fighting in Tokoza has been mostly between Zulus in thehostels and other blacks in the squatter camps, but on Tuesdaynight the violence spread to nearby middle-class homes.   Township residents said white men wearing masks took part inattacks in the area, a charge made frequently in recent days.Police say they are investigating, but have no evidence to supportthe claim.   The townhsip fighting erupted Aug. 12 between Zulus loyal to theconservative Inkatha movement and other blacks supporting theAfrican National Congress. The fighting spread from the easternprovince of Natal, where the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about5,000 blacks since 1986.   De Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela met Tuesday, butannounced no new plans to stop the bloodshed.   Mandela accused the government of waging war against the ANC andsaid failure to halt fighting threatened talks on ending apartheid.   ``We will do everything in our power to ensure that the peaceprocess remains on track, but the government has to do its part,''Mandela said after Tuesday's meeting. If the government ``isdragging its feet as it is doing now, then the peace process isdefinitely threatened.''</TEXT></DOC>
