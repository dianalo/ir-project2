As savings institution losses have mounted, congressional debatehas intensified over whether taxpayers must pay to bailout theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., and over alternatives totax money.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates Sandamp;Ls andoversees the insurance fund, maintains the assessment levied on theindustry can cover the costs.   But many analysts, and now Greenspan, agree that the insurancefund's current flow of revenue isn't enough.   ``Clearly the FSLIC will need additional resources,'' Greenspansaid in a statement released Wednesday by the Senate BankingCommittee.   But he added that any move to tap the Fed for money ``would marka sharp departure from the view traditionally held in our nationthat the resources of the Federal Reserve ... should not be used forspecial purposes and would set a dangerous precedent for thefuture.''   He also said that ``funding from the Federal Reserve would add tothe federal budget deficit essentially in the same way as a budgetexpenditure.''   The Fed, as the nation's central bank, uses its funds to controlinflation in the economy, intervene in foreign exchange markets andact as a lender of last resort during financial crises such as theOctober 1987 stock market crash.   Greenspan's remarks, made in a statement dated Oct. 17, wereoffered in response to questions, submitted July 29 by the BankingCommittee, on a wide range of subjects.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., who is expected to becomechairman of the committee next year, asked Greenspan about aproposal to require the Fed to pay interest on reserves it hold fromU.S. commercial banks and channel the money to the FSLIC. Anothersuggestion would require the Fed to accept as collateral for loansFSLIC notes issued to ailing Sandamp;Ls.   Greenspan offered no solution to the Sandamp;L crisis but said hisagency would express its views when Congress takes up the topic. Inthe meantime, he said the Federal Reserve Banks would act as alender of last resort to Sandamp;Ls in trouble if the Federal Home LoanBank system cannot.   His comments came three weeks after L. William Seidman, chairmanof the insurance fund for commercial banks, told the AmericanBankers Association he would fight any attempt to tap the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.   Government estimates have put the cost of restoring the Sandamp;Lindustry to solvency at $45 billion to $50 billion, with privateanalysts setting the cost at up to $100 billion.   Greenspan said ``great uncertainty'' surrounds estimates of Sandamp;Llosses because ``relatively small changes'' in the value of realestate securing loans to troubled institutions ``can have a majorimpact on the magnitude of thrift industry losses.''   ``But ... it is clear that the FSLIC is facing large problemswhich are going to be with us for some time to come,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
