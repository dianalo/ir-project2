Connors, who dodged bullets on ``Tightrope,'' ``Mannix'' and``Today's FBI'' and is host of the syndicated show ``Crimes of theCentury,'' is the victim on Sunday's episode of ``Murder, SheWrote.'' The hit series stars Angela Lansbury as crime-solvingmystery writer Jessica Fletcher.   He plays a screenwriter who's adapting one of Jessica's books asa movie.   ``He's a throwback character, a combination of Humphrey Bogartand John Garfield,'' said Connors. ``He's driving from Las Vegas andtakes a detour and sees an old girlfriend slinging hash. He says,`There she was, a little worse for wear, but still a hot cup ofcoffee to a thirsty guy like me.'   ``We do some flashbacks in black and white. Then I'm shot, and Igrab a tape recorder and start telling the story of why I was shot.It's because of that style that I was intrigued with the show.''   Connors said the only other time he has been killed on screen wasearly in his career when he did a movie for Roger Corman.   He will also be seen in May when the final 12 hours of ``War andRemembrance'' are telecast by ABC. He plays Hack Peters, a colonelwho is working on the atomic bomb and gets involved with RhodaHenry, the wife of Pug Henry.   His latest series is ``Crimes of the Century,'' which re-createsfamous crimes from the Lindbergh kidnapping to the ``YorkshireRipper'' in England.   ``What's so fascinating is not the crime but the information thatcomes up,'' said Connors. ``Information that might have changed theoutcome of the case. Sam Sheppard (whose conviction in thebludgeoning death of his wife was later overturned) claimed that hesaw a bushy-haired man. But the murder weapon, believed to be firetongs, was never found.   ``His next-door neighbor was a bushy-haired man and after he diedthe new owner of the house was doing some digging and found themissing fire tongs.''   The show began as two highly rated specials on ABC, but became asyndicated series because, Connors said, ABC News objected to aregular, reality-based show produced outside the network.   Connors starred on CBS as private detective Joe Mannix from 1967to '75. Mannix began as an employee of a computerized detectiveagency, but soon switched over to the traditional format. JosephCampanella was his boss the first year. After that, Robert Reedbecame his police contact and Gail Fisher was his secretary.   He said he's ready to do a ``Mannix'' movie, but Paramount hasturned down all requests so far.   ``I get a call from some independent producer about every sixmonths,'' he said. ``I'm interested as long as the script and storyis not childish. But nothing ever happens. Paramount won't sell therights, nor will they do a movie. All we want is a license to do atwo-hour movie.''   His most recent feature film was ``The Fistfighter,'' and beforethat he starred in and produced ``Too Scared to Scream.'' AnneArcher co-starred and Tony Lo Bianco directed on location in NewYork. ``That film took about two years of my life,'' Connors said.   He recently participated in a recording and video to benefit thevictims of the earthquake in the Armenian republic in the SovietUnion. More than 100 performers took part in the recording.   Connors is of Armenian descent and occasionally explored hisbackground in ``Mannix.'' He also made a pilot called ``Ohanian,''which is his real name.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   FIRST MOVIE _ Richard and Esther Shapiro, the creators of``Dynasty,'' are filming their first movie for NBC, ``When We WereYoung.''
