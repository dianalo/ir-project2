W. Wayne Allen was named vice president, international exploration and production; John Whitmire was named vice president, North American exploration and production; and Charles L. Wyndham was appointed vice president, exploration.    Phillips also named John R. Van Buskirk vice president, plastics division.    All four were formerly managers of company operations.    In December, the company said it would lay off as much as 10% of its work force and consolidate some operations in hopes of saving as much as to $200 million over the next two years. The action followed an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting that set oil prices at $18 a barrel. Analysts are skeptical that oil-producing countries will honor that agreement. Since that meeting, it was reported that Saudi Arabian oil officials expect oil prices to fall to as low as $15 a barrel, perhaps as early as the end of this month. </TEXT></DOC>
