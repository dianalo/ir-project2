NBC quoted unidentified Navy sources as disclosing ``somedisturbing facts'' about a surviving sailor who stands to collect$100,000 from the insurance policy of a gunner's mate killed in theexplosion April 19.   Investigators found gunpower and blasting caps in a search ofthe belongings of Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, 21, twoyears ago after he was arrested for stealing a car, NBC said. In asearch of his home after the explosion, investigators found one ofthe burlap patches that gunners insert between bags of powder toclean the barrels of the battleship's huge guns during firing, thenetwork said.   Truitt was quoted in published reports last week as saying theNavy created homicide or suicide scenarios involving him andClayton M. Hartwig, 25, to make them scapegoats for an explosioninvestigators cannot otherwise explain.   Truitt has denied any blame for the explosion, and has said thatin response to investigators' questions, he denied a homosexualrelationship with Hartwig.   NBC said that because the Navy has failed to find an accidentalcause for the explosion, it believes it may have been causeddeliberately through placement of a detonating device in one of theburlap patches, which normally would have been handled by Hartwig.   However, his sister, Kathleen Kubicina, said Wednesday nightthat reports that Hartwig helped load the fatal shell wereinaccurate.   ``My brother wasn't on the duty roster that day,'' Mrs. Kubicinasaid in a telephone interview with The Associated Press inCleveland. ``He was in the turret but he was not on duty that day.''   She said she has talked to a Naval Investigative Serviceinvestigator looking into the accident.   Hartwig's family told NBC that he was depressed when hisfriendship with Truitt broke down last year. The family also saidthat at age 17, Hartwig threatened suicide when anotherrelationship ended, NBC said.   NBC said other sources, which it did not identify, have learnedthat before the Iowa went on maneuvers off Puerto Rico, Hartwigwrote several letters that could be construed as farewell messages.   Mrs. Kubicina said her brother was not a homosexual.   ``He was a loner,'' Mrs. Kubicina said in an interview with TheAssociated Press. ``He did a lot of reading.   ``He wanted to be in the Navy,'' she said. ``My dad was agunner's mate on destroyer in World War II.''   Mrs. Kubicina said earlier Wednesday that she is contesting thefairness of Truitt collecting $100,000 from her brother's insurancepolicy.   A Naval Investigative Service agent told Mrs. Kubicina thatHartwig's insurance policy, which listed Truitt as its beneficiary,would not be paid until the Navy completes its investigation of theexplosion.   She said NIS agents have visited her and her family four timessince the explosion to question them about Hartwig and hisrelationship with Truitt.   Earl Hartwig said his son and Truitt took out $50,000 policiesfrom the Navy credit union just before their battleship leftNorfolk for the Persian Gulf in 1987. The policies carried doubleindemnities for accidental death, making Truitt's payout $100,000.   Truitt had dropped Hartwig, however, as the beneficiary on hispolicy, said Earl Hartwig.   Mrs. Kubicina said a close friendship between the two men wanedbecause Truitt was married last year and his wife did not care forHartwig. She said Hartwig intended to change his beneficiary, too.   ``I'm sure he had all intentions of changing it. I'm sure ofit,'' she said. ``He had made comments to myself and my parents.''   The Hartwigs will receive a $50,000 payout on a separategovernment life insurance policy.   Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., referred questionsabout the case to the Navy Office of Information in Washington. Lt.Bruce Cole of the information office said the investigation of theblast was continuing and ``nothing is categorically rejected.''   The Atlantic Fleet would not provide information on how tocontact Truitt, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection withthe explosion.   ``In my opinion, they have no idea what's going on, what causedit,'' Truitt told the Newport News Daily Press and the Times-Heraldin a story published Sunday. ``I think they're trying to find aneasy way out.''   Truitt said he is used to being a scapegoat and that he andHartwig often had been harrassed by fellow sailors ``becauseneither one of us drinks. ... They razz you if you're not out therewith them getting trashed.''   Mrs. Kubicina said she did not intend to raise the possibilitythat the explosion was caused deliberately.   ``I don't wany anyone to think, including Ken, that I think hewas a murderer,'' she said by phone from her home. ``I don't thinkso. Truthfully, honestly, I don't know the man.''</TEXT></DOC>
