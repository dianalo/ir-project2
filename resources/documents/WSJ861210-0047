In a heated exchange with reporters yesterday, Mr. Speakes also said that Mr. Reagan shouldn't be expected to remember authorizing the arms sales to Iran in 1985 any more than a reporter should be expected to remember where he ate lunch 15 months ago.    &quot;The president does not condone the breaking of a law by any individual,&quot; Mr. Speakes said, distancing the White House from Mr. Buchanan's remarks in a Washington Post column and a speech Monday. Mr. Buchanan compared the secret Iran-Nicaragua arms policy to the Underground Railroad to free U.S. slaves and to the secret U.S. order to sink German submarines at the start of World War II.    &quot;They broke the law. And they are considered now -- and they consider themselves -- to be heroes. And Ollie North is a hero,&quot; Mr. Buchanan wrote, referring to Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was fired by Mr. Reagan for carrying out a clandestine policy of selling arms to Iran and diverting the profits to the Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras.    Meanwhile, Republican governors meeting with Mr. Reagan yesterday transmitted comments from former President Richard Nixon, who earlier addressed the governors. According to Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh, Mr. Nixon said the Watergate crisis had been handled &quot;abysmally&quot; and by contrast, &quot;this president is doing everything right . . . to solve the questions that are pending.&quot;    New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean said Mr. Reagan recounted how on Nov. 21, when Attorney General Edwin Meese first told the president about the diversion of funds to the Contras, Mr. Meese called that a &quot;smoking gun.&quot; Mr. Reagan told them that neither he nor Mr. Meese had known about the transfer, Mr. Kean said.    Mr. Kean also described the president as &quot;frustrated&quot; by the legal contraints that now prevent the White House from questioning Lt. Col. North and former National Security Adviser John Poindexter.    In a speech in Miami Monday night, Mr. Buchanan said the issue in Nicaragua is &quot;not whether technicalities of the law were circumvented, but whether or not communism will be stopped&quot; before it establishes a permanent base in Central America.    Mr. Buchanan said on television last night that he made these comments &quot;on my own,&quot; but added: &quot;I have reason to believe the president of the United States is not displeased with his director of communications, as controversial as he may be.&quot;    Mr. Buchanan said the reason he's speaking out now is that &quot;it's turning into a political battle, not just an investigation,&quot; and this battle threatens the Reagan agenda. Praising the president's disclosure of the diversion of funds to the Contras, Mr. Buchanan said: &quot;Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese are the Woodward and Bernstein of this. They ought to get the Pulitzer Prize.&quot;    In his article, Mr. Buchanan had also blasted Republicans for failing to support Mr. Reagan during the crisis, saying the whole &quot;pack has headed for the tall grass.&quot; Mr. Speakes said yesterday that Mr. Reagan doesn't feel abandoned by Republicans.    Facing a barrage of press questions about the Iran-Nicaragua controversy, Mr. Speakes also asserted yesterday that it was &quot;unfair&quot; to expect the president to remember his alleged authorization of secret arms shipments to Iran through Israel in August 1985, until he had refreshed his memory by going over what written records might exist.    Mr. Speakes said he didn't know when the president will finish this process and added that while Mr. Reagan doesn't customarily take notes at meetings with aides, there were other methods that investigators might use to help him determine what happened.    When Sacramento Bee reporter Leo Rennert persisted in seeking further clarification, Mr. Speakes interrupted by saying: &quot;Do you recall what you had for lunch on the first day of September 1985, on or about 12 noon in a Washington restaurant?&quot;    Saying, &quot;Leo, I'm about to get enough of you,&quot; Mr. Speakes added: &quot;Go, Leo. Make a fool of yourself, Leo.&quot;    Mr. Rennert, not budging from his chair in the White House briefing room, replied: &quot;If I'd been involved in August-September '85 in a clandestine shipment of arms to Israel, I sure as hell would remember today without looking for a paper.&quot;    Mr. Speakes later said he had &quot;interviewed a number of people and they don't recall&quot; Mr. Reagan's giving spoken approval to then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane for secret third-country shipments in August or September 1985.    Mr. McFarlane testified Monday that he had an oral authorization from Mr. Reagan in August 1985 for arms shipments to Iran from a third country, which other officials have identified as Israel.    Mr. Speakes will step down as the administration's chief spokesman Feb. 1 to become senior vice president for communications at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. But he joked yesterday that if the &quot;tedious&quot; questions about Iran persist, &quot;I may stay around&quot; longer at the White House. </TEXT></DOC>
