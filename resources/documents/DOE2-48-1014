Chemical modification can be divided into three major areas:radioprotection, chemical sensitization, and cytoxicity. Although modestradioprotection may be obtained by physiologic means, the most importantprotective agents discovered thus far are the sulfhydryl-containing compounds.Differential radioprotection occurs not only because of decreased protectionof hypoxic cells. Chemical sensitizers of radiotherapy fall into twomajor classes: hypoxic cell sensitizers and halogenated pyrimidines.Because of the high percentage of hypoxic cells in tumors, differentialsensitization occurs with chemicals that mimic oxygen. Halogenated pyrimidinesare incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and thus will differentiallysensitize tumors located in nondividing normal tissues. Cytotoxic chemicalsused in cancer chemotherapy have been selected primarily for antitumoreffect. In addition, they may modify the extent of radiation injury.The potential for chemical modification is clear but has only reachedclinical significance in randomized trials in combination with cytotoxicchemotherapy. The interim results of ongoing clinical trials with hypoxiccell sensitizers, halogenated pyrimidines, and protectors are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
