An investor group led by Fort Worth millionaire Robert Bassfailed to raise the bond financing needed to take Michaels Storesprivate, the specialty retailer announced Friday.   Despite a willingness by store management and the Bass group,MSI Holdings, to complete the deal, analysts said it was unlikelythat the $150 million in junk bond and bank financing could bearranged before the Dec. 31 expiration of the agreement. It wasalso unclear whether either side would extend the deadline.   ``The deal is technically dead at the end of the month,'' saidMichaels President B.B. Tuley. Regarding completion of the deal, hesaid, ``I can't say if I am optimistic or pessimistic.''   An extension of the agreement would depend on sales during thefourth quarter, which includes the Christmas rush, Tuley said.Fourth quarter sales comprise 40 percent of the company's revenueand 60 percent to 70 percent of its operating profits annually.   MSI Holdings, which offered investors $9.50 per share in cashand $2.50 per share in preferred stock, is controlled by merchantbanker Grauer andamp; Wheat Investments and a Bass entity, AcadiaPartners LP. American Express and Equitable Life Assurance Societyare two of Acadia's partners.   The investor group says it will continue to seek financingthrough Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York.   Dennis Telzrow, an analyst at Eppler Guerin andamp; Turner Inc., saidthe proposed buyout would heavily leverage the company, which maybe one reason why the Michaels deal is being viewed skeptically bythe market.   ``We felt the financing was questionable because of the cashflow coverage,'' Telzrow said. Under the $225 million buyout, thecompany's debt to equity ratio would climb from 2-to-1 to about4-or 5-to-1.   About $75 million of the $150 million in debt would be junkbonds, with the rest either bank financing or senior debt, saidPeter Grauer, co-chairman of Grauer andamp; Wheat Investments. Afinancing commitment has already been obtained from Wells Fargo andamp;Co. in San Francisco.   A home decoration and arts and crafts retailer, Michaelsoperates 121 stores in 17 states.</TEXT></DOC>
