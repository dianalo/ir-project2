The U.S. currency also fell past some significant levels against other major currencies, traders said.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York sold yen to purchase &quot;several hundred million&quot; dollars yesterday afternoon, the head of trading at a major New York bank said. He said such intervention is &quot;just barely&quot; preventing a still more serious rout of the dollar.    &quot;They're only breaking the momentum of the trend, and only for today,&quot; Michael Snow, senior vice president, foreign exchange, at Union Bank of Switzerland's New York branch, said. &quot;The trend is down, and the mood is down,&quot; he said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 146.25 yen, down 0.6% from 147.10 Friday but up from a post-World War II low of 144.70 set early in the day in Tokyo. Its partial recovery was attributed to the Bank of Japan's sale of yen to buy about $2 billion in Tokyo. In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, it was quoted at 145.75 yen.    The dollar fell more sharply against major European currencies, in what traders said was an adjustment for its declines against the yen in previous recent sessions. The dollar fell 0.9% to 1.7995 West German marks from 1.8163 and 0.9% to 1.4995 Swiss francs from 1.5130.    &quot;The yen is leading the mark, and leading the Swiss franc,&quot; Mary Anne Tompkins, a senior trader for Royal Bank of Canada in New York, said.    Some traders described a growing market willingness to sell the dollar despite yesterday's intervention, which followed last week's estimated $6 billion of central bank purchases aimed at propping up the U.S. currency.    &quot;There's more confidence to attack&quot; the dollar now, Mr. Snow said.    Ms. Tompkins said traders &quot;are still wary&quot; of intervention but aren't paralyzed by it.    &quot;The central banks can turn (the dollar) around, but it's only temporary when they do,&quot; she said.    Concern about U.S. economic sluggishness, particularly problems related to the trade and budget deficits, is fueling the dollar's downward drive. And recent trade friction between the U.S. and Japan has raised fears of &quot;a full-blown trade war,&quot; which would further stifle the U.S. economy, Mr. Snow said.    In Tokyo, traders said the dollar was lifted partly by comments by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone at a parliamentary budget committee hearing. Mr. Nakasone indicated that the round of central bank intervention had been aimed at propping the dollar up to 150 yen. The prime minister said this was the target level set by finance officials at the six-nation Paris meeting Feb. 22 where an agreement to stabilize exchange rates was made.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Monday, gold for current delivery fell 70 cents an ounce to $421.10 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 6.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $421.30 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, March 30, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
