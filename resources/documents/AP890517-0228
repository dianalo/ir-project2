Germany And Japan Might Be Helping Dollar's Rise</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Political instability in Japan and West Germanymay help account for the weakness of their currencies and therelative strength of the dollar, some economists believe.   The dollar rose Monday to its highest level against the WestGerman mark since the end of 1986 and its highest level against theJapanese yen since November 1987. It edged back on Tuesday.   Market sentiment is the main cause of the dollar's rise, and ifpsychology changes, the currency could drop as quickly as it shotup.   Some analysts say the dollar's rise has little to do withpolitics. ``If the dollar was falling, people would come up with areason why that was happening,'' said Shafiqul Islam, senior fellowfor finance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.   But the more common view is that political factors are givingthe dollar an artificial and probably temporary boost, an opinionheld by David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial ServicesInc. in Chicago.   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and his LiberalDemocratic Party have been crippled by a spreading influence-buyingscandal.   Takeshita remains in office in spite of single-digit approvalratings because attempts to find a successor have beenunsuccessful. The ruling party is trying to gain public support intime for elections in July for the upper house of the parliament.   Meanwhile, in West Germany, the Christian Democratic Union ofChancellor Helmut Kohl has been trailing the opposition SocialDemocrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls.   Kohl shuffled his Cabinet last month in a step that the SocialDemocrats derided as ``Kohl's last stand.'' Some observers believeKohl could lose office if the allied Free Democrats pull out of theruling coalition.   ``Investors in stocks and bonds in a foreign currency tend torequire a risk premium when there's a situation unfolding that'sunsettling and raises question about economic policy,'' saidWilliam Sterling, manager of international economics for MerrillLynch andamp; Co.   There are other reasons for the dollar's rise, includingrelatively high interest rates in the United States that makedollar-denominated investments more attracive.   Currency traders typically follow the dictum that ``the trend isyour friend,'' and as long as the dollar seems to be on an upwardtrend, dealers figure they can make more money by buying it than byselling it.   Ordinarily the Bank of Japan would raise Japanese interest ratesto pull the yen out of its slide. But the central bank is reluctantto do that because it could hurt the price of bonds and stocks,particularly shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. thathave already lost about half of their value.   Unlike the rigorously independent Federal Reserve, Japan'scentral bank is tied to the Ministry of Finance, which is in chargeof floating NTT shares and moreover has been sullied in theinfluence-peddling scandal.   The situation in West Germany is somewhat different, since thecentral bank is independent and freely raises rates when necessaryto stem inflation. In fact, base rates have been raised three timessince last fall.   But the political instability in West Germany could be drivinginvestors to change their marks into dollars and invest them in theUnited States, said Mieczyslaw Karczmar, a New York-based adviserto Deutsche Bank of West Germany.   ``The issue of a stable political climate and safety is terriblyimportant,'' Karczmar said. ``Capital for obvious reasons seekssafety and stability.''   The United States has a huge trade deficit, but for nowinvestors are choosing to ignore it, focusing instead on issuessuch as attractive U.S. interest rates and the nation's politicalstability.   Aside from politics, many traders believe that TreasurySecretary James A. Baker III and other U.S. officials do not mind arise in the dollar now, in spite of public commitments to stabilizeits value.</TEXT></DOC>
