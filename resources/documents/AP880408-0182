(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here is the text of a statement readFriday by television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who was defrockedby the Assemblies of God:   I wish to express to all the state and national officials of theAssemblies of God my sincere appreciation for the kindness andconsideration they have shown me in the midst of a very tryingsituation.   They have conducted themselves as Christian gentlemen. Weappreciate that. I would like to believe that I understand thedifficulties and problems the Assemblies of God officials face,respecting the guidelines for rehabilitation. I have tried to putmyself in their shoes and I can find no fault with the decision.Admittedly I had hoped the decision would have gone in anotherdirection, but I do understand their reasoning.   We are seeking God almost continuously and, of course, ourimmediate concern is to salvage the ministry. We believe that tostay out of the pulpit for a year would totally destroy thetelevision ministry and greatly adversely impact the college.Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to take aposition that does not answer all the questions nor solve all theproblems, but we feel we have no alternative or choice. Therefore,I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies of God,understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss mefrom the fellowship since I am presently not in good standing withthe fellowship. Even though it is a moot point at this time, Icontinue to abide by the original directives of the LouisianaDistrict.   This in no way is meant to imply rebellion against the decisionof the General Presbytery. I greatly appreciate the kindness andconsideration shown to me by the brethern of the Louisianadistrict. I ask that the supporters of this ministry and theministers of the Assembly of God remember us in prayer. Ourposition will not be easy and it will take a miracle of God for thesituation to improve.   I want all concerned to know that I in no way mean to placemyself in a position of defying the Assemblies of God or itsofficers. That is not my intention in any way. I will never say aderogatory thing about the Assemblies of God. We would never wantto do anything that would prove harmful to this great fellowship. Ilove this Assemblies of God fellowship that I have been associatedwith for so long. I still feel it is among the greatest fellowshipson the face of the earth. It is our every intention to be ofservice as much as possible. I would pray that my ministry cancontinue to channel many of the souls God would help us to win intoAssemblies of God churches. They could have no better home. I willalways be Assemblies of God in spirit and in doctrine and eventhough what help we can give will be from a distance we willcontinue to do what we can.   I sincerely apologize to the officials of the Assemblies of Godand all its ministers of the Gospel for any and all concerns andburdens that have come about because of my personal failure. Merewords do not help much and I wish it were possible to erase theledger and start over again but of course it is not.   Perhaps in God's gracious wisdom and his loving kindness he willhelp us to solve problems regarding the continuation of theministry God has given us. These problems are unsolvable withoutGod's help.</TEXT></DOC>
