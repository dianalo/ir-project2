The double-walledtube construction along with double-barrier welds for tube-to-tubesheetjoints virtually eliminates the probability of heat transfer tube failures.Considerations are given to the use of the internal core tube, helicalvane swirl generator, external protector tube, and variably perforatedflow baffle to improve thermal and hydraulic performance of the steamgenerator. These thermal hydraulic design features with a particularreference to a 432 Mwt PRISM steam generator are discussed in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
