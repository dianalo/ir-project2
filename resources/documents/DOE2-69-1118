After briefly introducingthe meaning of the model parameters, a mathematical description of theflow-through diffusion test is given in order to clearly identify theirmeaning, and to demonstrate the basis for the improvement over the classicalsteady state interpretation method. The method is applied to data obtainedfrom reconsolidated day plugs of the Mol site being investigated forgeological disposal of nuclear waste. Special attention is given to thereduction of the error on the estimated model parameters and to the importantreduction of the time (a factor 5 to 10) needed to run the experiment.Some preliminary results of the application of the method to the evaluationof the model parameters of HTO and iodide are reported. The influenceof the consolidation on the transport is indicated.</TEXT></DOC>
