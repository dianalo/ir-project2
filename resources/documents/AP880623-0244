American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker willask his 3,000 delegates at their July 2-6 convention in SanFrancisco to endorse his call for a myriad of experimental``schools within schools.''   Mary Hatwood Futrell, the president of the giant NationalEducation Association, will seek from her 8,000 delegates, meetingin New Orleans July 4-7, an endorsement of her proposal to createan experimental lighthouse district in each state where ``anythinggoes.''   Like the rest of the labor movement, both the NEA and the AFThave refrained from endorsing a candidate for president.   That could change for the NEA as early as next Saturday when itsboard of directors meets in New Orleans. The NEA's political actioncommittee will consider an endorsement on Friday.   If it decides to make an endorsement, the 1.9 million-member NEAwould be the first major union to back Democrat Michael Dukakis.   The AFT, like its parent AFL-CIO, is holding its fire, but itsleaders are not. Both Shanker and Rachelle Horowitz, the AFT'spolitical director, will be Dukakis delegates in Atlanta.   Futrell, a Mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist inher home state of Virginia, will not be a delegate this timearound. But Kenneth Melley, the NEA's director of governmentrelations, said the union will have a contingent of about 250delegates in Atlanta, with a large majority for Dukakis and severaldozen for Jesse Jackson.   The NEA fielded nearly 400 delegates in 1984 at the Democraticconvention.   Both unions now are unremittingly hostile to the educationpolicies of President Reagan and his secretary of education,William J. Bennett, who has accused teacher unions of trying to``hijack'' the school reform movement with extortionate demands formore money without increased accountability.   The AFT, which has criticized Reagan's education cuts, invitedReagan to address its convention five years ago and heard himshower the union with praise for being open-minded on things suchas merit pay and for supporting a rigorous curriculum.   Whatever openness the AFT exhibited then, it has since revertedto a stance as critical of merit pay as any taken by the NEA.Indeed, one of the nation's largest experiments with merit pay isunderway in Fairfax County, Va., the 10th biggest school district,where most of the teachers belong to the NEA.   A resolution on education reform that will be debated by the AFTdelegates says many of the reforms launched since the 1983 report``A Nation At Risk'' has been bad. Of merit pay, it says,``Traditional merit pay schemes, now bearing new names, continue torear their unsubstantiated heads.''   Shanker, unlike Futrell, is still on the White House guest listfor education events. Or at least he was until this spring, when heemerged from a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of ``A NationAt Risk'' to write a barbed open letter to Bennett accusing him ofa ``major failure of leadership.''   ``Instead of leading your troops, you kept shooting at them,''Shanker said.   Futrell said in an interview, ``It took him 3{ years to realizeMr. Bennett was not an advocate for education.''   Shanker said he does not regret the AFT policy of willingness toentertain any and all school reform proposals. His affiliates inRochester, N.Y., Dade County, Fla., Toledo, Ohio, and Hammond,Ind., have received wide attention for contracts that give teachersmore say in school management and peer review, but also hold themaccountable for improved performance.   ``I think we have fairly widespread acceptance now of thingsthat were considered pretty radical a few years ago,'' includingpeer review and wider teacher involvement in decision making,Shanker said.   But he remains deeply pessimistic about the current structure ofmost public schools, which Shanker contends deliver an inadequateeducation to 80 percent of American students. That is why he favorsradical and widespread experimentation with new forms of schoolorganization.   The resolution backed by the AFT's Executive Council would putthe union on record as favoring Shanker's idea of allowing groupsof six to 12 teachers the wherewithal to set up their own schoolswithin school, provided they got the approval of their local unionand school board, and could convince enough teachers, parents andstudents to voluntarily sign up for the type of instruction theywere offering.   Futrell said she hopes her lighthouse school district proposalwill lead to establishment of model districts in all 50 states.   ``We want them to feel free to experiment. What we want is tofundamentally and systemically restructure school systems. We'rewilling to look at everything,'' she said.   At the same time, the union would insist that such models not becreated by top-down fiat, but through consensus among all affectedconstituencies: parents, teachers, school administrators, business.   She wants to include rural, urban and suburban districts, and atleast some of those districts should reflect ``the racial andethnic makeup of our country.''   Another issue expected to spur debate at both teacherconventions is the tracking of students into classes for studentswith high, middle and low abilities. Futrell has been sharplycritical of tracking, which some researchers say does little goodfor kids at the top and harms the kids at the bottom.   A proposed NEA resolution says: ``The National EducationAssociation believes that the use of discriminatory academictracking based on socioeconomic status, race, or sex must beeliminated in all public school settings. The Association urges itsaffiliates to oppose these practices.''   Futrell indicated she will ask her delegates to authorize amajor study over the next year of tracking and ways to devise lessdiscriminatory alternatives.   It remains a thorny issue.   ``I think it's very political,'' Futrell said. ``We have to behonest. In some school districts, in order to hold on to the middleclass white students, you needed to set up the Advanced Placementor high level classes.''   The NEA's membership has grown in the past year to more than 1.9million _ including about 1.5 million public school teachers _while the AFT has 665,000 members, including about 450,000teachers. There are more than 2.3 million teachers in publicschools; roughly 15 percent belong to neither union.   Futrell is entering her sixth and final year as NEA president.Shanker is running unopposed for re-election as head of AFT, a posthe has held since 1974.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 26</NOTE></DOC>
