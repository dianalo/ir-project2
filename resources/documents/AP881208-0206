We shall therefore alsopropose that no country should be entitled to possess more than afixed proportion, such as 30 percent, of the total holdings inEurope of the 23 participants in each equipment category. In thecase of tanks, this would result in an entitlement of no more thanabout 12,000 tanks for any one country.   _Limiting numbers and nationality of forces would not by itselfaffect the stationing of forces on other countries' territory.Stationed forces, particularly those in active combat units, areespecially relevant to surprise attack. We shall propose limits onsuch forces.   _Our proposal will apply to the whole of Europe. In order toavoid undue concentration of these weapon categories in certainareas of Europe, we shall propose appropriate sub-limits.   6. To buttress the resulting reductions in force levels in thewhole of Europe, we shall propose stabilizing measures. These couldinclude measures of transparency, notifications and constraintapplied to the deployment, movement and levels of readiness ofconventional armed forces, which include conventional armaments andequipment.   7. Finally, we shall require a rigorous and reliable regime formonitoring and verification. This would include the periodicexchange of detailed data about forces and deployments, and theright to conduct on-site inspections.   8. Greater transparency is an essential requirement for realstability. Therefore, within the framework of the CSCE process, thenegotiations on confidence and security-building measures form anessential complement to those on conventional stability. We areencouraged thus far by the successful implementation of theStockholm document and we consider that the momentum must bemaintained.   9. In order to create transparency of military organization, weplan to introduce a proposal for a wide-ranging, comprehensiveannual exchange of information concerning military organization,manpower and equipment as well as major weapon deployment programs.To evaluate this information we will propose modalities for theestablishment of a random evaluation system.   10. In addition, in order to build on the success of theStockholm document and to create greater transparency of militaryactivities, we will propose measures in areas such as:   _more detailed information with regard to the notification ofmilitary exercises,   _improvements in the arrangements for observing militaryactivities,   _greater openness and predictability about military activities,   _a strengthening of the regime for ensuring compliance andverification.   11. Finally, we shall propose additional measures designed toimprove contacts and communications between participating states inthe military field; to enhance access for military staffs and mediarepresentatives; and to increase mutual understanding of militarycapabilities, behavior and force postures. We will also proposemodalities for an organized exchange of views on military doctrinetied to actual force structures, capabilities and dispositions inEurope.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
