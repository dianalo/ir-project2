As for a hydraulic power plant,the progress of automated facilities and control equipment, the totalmonitoring and control system, and as future subjects, the digitalizedcontrol equipment and automated maintenance service are described. Asfor a thermal power plant, the progress from an automated operation controlto a total digitalized control, and as future subjects, the centralizedmonitoring and control system covering all facilities in a station, automatedmaintenance services and advanced facility diagnosis techniques are described.As for a nuclear power plant, the development trend of monitoring andcontrol systems for a boiling water reactor(BWR), and the structure andfunctions of the distributed type automated control system composed ofa process ocmpurter and microcomputers are described. In addition, thetrend of advanced techniques for the automated maintenance service andfacility diagnosis system is described which give top priority to a plantsafty.
