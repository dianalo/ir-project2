(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bill that would virtually ban thesale of more than 40 types of assault weapons in California,including the one used to kill five schoolchildren, was approvedMonday by the Assembly without a vote to spare.   The measure was sent to the Senate by a 41-38 vote _ the baremajority needed for approval in the 80-seat lower house _ after asometimes heated, two-hour debate.   The Assembly action means that both houses of the Legislaturehave now passed bills to restrict access to the weapons. The Senateoverwhelmingly approved a broader proposal last Thursday.   But the author of the Assembly bill, Assemblyman Mike Roos, saidsupporters of the two measures face still face ticklish obstacles ingetting one of the bills to Gov. George Deukmejian, who hasindicated support for Roos' proposal but not the Senate version.   ``It's not downhill,'' he told reporters after the vote. ``It'sgoing to be vote by vote. Every time I change a line (in the bill)it's a reason for people to drop off.''   Roos said he had lost some support for the bill over the weekendbecause of last-minute pressure from gun groups, who want to preventCalifornia from becoming the first state to ban assault weapons.   The two bills were introduced in January after a derangeddrifter, Patrick Purdy, opened fire at a crowded Stocktonschoolyard, killing five young students and wounding 29 others, aswell as a teacher.   Purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds across the playground, using asemiautomatic version of the AK-47, an assault rifle that police sayis becoming increasingly popular with street gangs.   Roos' bill started off as identical to the bill sponsored bySenate leader David Roberti, which includes a general definition ofassault weapons. But Roos' bill was restricted in committee to coverabout 36 models of rifles, eight types of pistols, three types ofshotguns, and nearly identical weapons.   The Assembly measure, with few exceptions, would bar themanufacture, importation, sale, giving or lending of the assaultweapons after next Jan. 1. Use of one of the weapons in a felonycould result in a five-year prison sentence enhancement.   Adults who legally possessed the weapons before next Oct. 1 couldkeep them if they registered them with the state. Anyone who wantedto legally obtain one of the guns after Sept. 30 and keep it afterJan. 1 would have to obtain the same type of permit required for amachine gun.   Only about 350 machine-gun permits are in use now in the state.   After next Jan. 1, an assault weapon could only be sold to alicensed gun dealer or to someone out of state, under the bill'sprovisions.   Differences between the Roos and Roberti measures will probablybe ironed out in a two-house conference committee, Roos said,assuming that the bills make it through the opposite house.</TEXT></DOC>
