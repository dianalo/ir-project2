Amnesty International, in a report called ``Afghanistan:Unlawful Killings and Torture,'' also said civilians were killed ortortured in reprisals for the actions of Afghan rebels fighting theSoviet-backed government in Kabul.   Amnesty International said its main concern was the allegedkilling of ``clearly helpless'' civilians, particularly refugees.   It cited one instance in which 100 families were attacked twiceon their 300-mile trek out of the country. Killed were 24 refugees,including seven children under the age of six, it said.   ``Amnesty International has compiled evidence of what appears tobe a policy of deliberate killings by Soviet and Afghan governmentforces of Afghan refugees found traveling toward Pakistan,'' saidthe report.   The London-based rights group said soliders have attacked``buses and groups of women, children and men moving on foot and onhorseback,'' many of whom were fleeing Soviet and Afghan bombingand shelling of their villages in retaliation for guerrilla attacks.   Amnesty International said its representatives visited refugeesin Pakistan and India and obtained information from witnesses tothe attacks.   The nine-page report dealt with 1987 and early 1988.   The human rights group said the Afghan government should makeevery effort to investigate the allegations during the withdrawalof Soviet forces from Afghanistan, scheduled to begin this month.The Soviets have been in the country since 1979 supporting thegovernment.   ``We are worried that ... during this interim period, if firmmeasures are not taken by the Kabul government, there could befurther human rights violations, especially killings and torture,''said Jawid Laiq of Amnesty.   ``There appears to be a policy to attack refugees,'' he said.``We feel that this has occurred fairly often although we can't puta number on it.''   About 3 million Afghan refugees have fled across the border toPakistan, where the Moslem guerrillas fighting the Kabul governmenthave bases.   United Nations officials have estimated that 2.2 million otherAfghan refugees live in Iran.   Under an accord signed last month, the Soviet army is to begin anine-month withdrawal of its 115,000 troops in Afghanistan. Theguerrillas say they will ignore the agreement and fight on.   Amnesty International also cited reports of the summaryexecutions of civilians who remained in their homes during the war,and the torture of others taken into custody.   The report said, however, information suggests that ``torturemay not be as systematic and as routine a form of interrogation asit was till early 1986.''</TEXT></DOC>
