The planned purchases of MD-90s and Boeing 737-300s over thenext 11 years is in addition to $13 billion in orders announcedpreviously. Delta now has 519 new jets on order as part of itsdrive to expand service and replace older aircraft.   Atlanta-based Delta ordered 50 Boeing 120-passenger 737-300 jetsand took options for 50 more. The first planes arrive in 1993.   Delta ordered 50 of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new 150-seat MD-90jets and took options to buy 110 more. But 60 of those options wereoriginally placed last year for MD-88 aircraft and convertedTuesday to MD-90 options, Delta said.   Deliveries begin in 1994.   A year ago Delta ordered $10 billion worth of mostlyinternational-range jets for expansion in Asia and Europe.   In all, Delta now has 182 orders and 337 options for new jetsworth $23 billion.   ``Delta is putting a lot of financial effort into keeping amodern, efficient fleet as we continue to grow,'' Chairman RonaldW. Allen said at a news conference Tuesday.   Allen said Delta expects to expand capacity by 5 percent to 7percent per year over the next decade.   Delta has the youngest fleet of any major U.S. carrier, andAllen said the airline hopes to maintain an average aircraft age ofabout 8 years by retiring older DC-9s, Boeing 727s and 737s.   ``This will give Delta the ability to go either into a heavyfleet replacement program or, depending on the market, a heavygrowth plan,'' said Paul Karos of First Boston Corp.   Allen said Delta expects to pay for the new planes primarilywith operating revenues. He said the airline, which earned a record$460.9 million last fiscal year, is committed to keeping its debtlow.   Allen said the purchases won't mean fare increases because amodern fleet saves money in the long run. ``I don't think our fareincreases will exceed the consumer price index in coming years,''he said.   The MD-90s have a list price of $40 million each, while 737-300scost about $29 million each. Allen declined to say how much of adiscount Delta will get. He also wouldn't say how much of a downpayment Delta must make.   The MD-90 is an updated version of McDonnell-Douglas's popularMD-80 series jet. It is five feet longer than the MD-88, with eightmore seats, and has quieter, more fuel-efficient engines. Delta isthe first to order an MD-90.   Allen said the 737-300s will have 120 seats _ eight fewer thanthe 13 737-300s Delta already has. With fewer seats, there will bemore leg room and bigger galleys and closets.</TEXT></DOC>
