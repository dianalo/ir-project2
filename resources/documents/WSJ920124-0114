Chairman Robert E. Allen said that the year's finalresults masked what he called &quot;fundamentally good trends inour business.&quot; Long-distance business grew in line withindustry volumes, and new businesses such as its Universalcredit card posted strong gains during a recession.</LP><TEXT>   But the quarterly showing, which included flat revenue andlower operating profit for the recently acquired NCR Corp.,disappointed analysts. In composite trading yesterday on theNew York Stock Exchange, ATandamp;T shares fell 87.5 cents to$39.50.   Net income for the quarter fell to $635 million, or 48cents a share, from $809 million, or 64 cents a share, a yearearlier. Operating profit, or income before interest expensesand taxes, fell 3.5% to $1.37 billion. Revenue was $11.95billion compared with $11.88 billion.   ATandamp;T's earnings in the quarter were reduced by $218million, or 14 cents a share, from 62 cents a share, becauseof a reduction in the book value of its investment in Cie.Industriali Riunite S.p.A., an Italian holding company whoseprimary investment is computer maker Olivetti.   Net income for the year, which included a third-quartercharge of $4.2 billion, fell to $522 million, or 40 cents ashare, from $3.1 billion, or $2.42 a share, in 1990. Revenuegrew 2.4% to $44.65 billion from $43.62 billion. Operatingprofit fell 75% to 1.36 billion.   ATandamp;T said excluding the charges and gains, its 1991earnings would have been $3.24 billion, or $2.51 a share.   The $4.2 billion of pretax write-downs and restructuringcharges taken in the third quarter -- $2.65 billion aftertaxes -- was due to ATandamp;T's absorption of NCR, the shutdown ofATandamp;T's own computer business and the consolidation offacilities and work force reductions.   ATandamp;T also posted one-time gains for the year of $143million, or about 11 cents a share, after taxes from sellingits investment in Sun Microsystems Inc., and a piece of itsUNIX System Laboratories subsidiary.   Mr. Allen said the company is &quot;determined&quot; to growglobally and has &quot;set our long-term planning sights&quot; on 10%annual earnings growth.   But analysts were unmoved. &quot;Six to seven months ago theywere saying their goal was 10% to 15% annual earnings growth. . . most likely in the top end of that range,&quot; said RobertB. Morris III, telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co. Now, he says, ATandamp;T is &quot;talking {earnings} growth of only10% this year.&quot;   The company said that its long-distance revenue grew 6% inthe quarter, to $5.28 billion, and 3.7% for the year, to$20.41 billion. Traffic volume rose nearly 6.5%, which Mr.Morris said &quot;shows their long-distance business is treadingwater since it's actually slightly less growth than they didin the third quarter.&quot;   But products and systems sales continued to slump,declining 7% in the quarter, to $4.4 billion, and 1.1% forthe year, to $15.94 billion. Sales of computer systems,including those of NCR, fell 20% to $1.08 billion in thequarter and 11% to $3.67 billion for the year.   While ATandamp;T said NCR posted &quot;record orders&quot; for thequarter, driven mainly by demand for its new 3000 Series ofcomputers, it was hurt by the computer industry slump andATandamp;T's hostile $7.48 billion takeover. NCR's operating incomefor the quarter dropped 57% to $90 million on flat revenue of$2 billion. For the year, NCR's operating profit fell 72%, inpart because of a $182 million charge to cover expensesrelated to the ATandamp;T merger, on flat sales of $6.3 billion.   Meanwhile, revenue from telecommunications networkproducts and systems dropped 7.2% to $1.95 billion in thequarter because of a slump in orders from phone companies,but revenue for the year grew 2.6% to $7.49 billion.International sales of network equipment climbed 7% to morethan $1.6 billion.   Revenue from financial services and leasing grew 36% to$420 million in the quarter and 71% for the year to $1.38billion. These figures include ATandamp;T's Universal credit card,now the country's fourth largest card program, but ATandamp;Tdidn't disclose separate revenue for the card business.   ATandamp;T said it will change the way it reports itslong-distance revenue in the future to &quot;better reflect&quot;performance and the &quot;end of an era&quot; of constant yearlyreductions in the amount it pays local phone companies forcompleting long-distance calls over their networks. Thosecharges, which are really transfer payments, amounted toabout $18 billion in 1991.   Separately, ATandamp;T said it will begin providing digitalsatellite private-line service for businesses in Beijing andShanghai, China. The international satellite service is thefirst phase of a two-part, $70 million network project beinghandled by ATandamp;T, Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan and China'stelecommunications authority.</TEXT></DOC>
