The two Aeroflot cargo jets are to land Saturday at McChord AirForce Base near Tacoma, which would be the first time Sovietaircraft have landed at the base, McChord officials said. An F-15fighter interceptor squadron is at the base.   The Soviet heavy freight transports are to each carry sixshelters developed two weeks ago for quick reassembly in Armenia.Volunteer workers at companies here made the shelters, 32 feet by 32feet, of plywood, tin roofs and insulation sufficient to protect asmany as 40 people from temperatures as low as 40 below zero.   The Soviet planes are scheduled to refuel at Elmendorf Air ForceBase at Anchorage, Alaska, en route to McChord.   In Seattle, at least 13 firefighters have volunteered to go onthe flights to Soviet Union to assemble the shelters.   The shelters are designed to last about three years, replacingcanvas tents while Soviets rebuild their earthquake-ravaged cities.   Bob Walsh, who arranged the flights partly through his contactsas president of a group planning the 1990 Goodwill Games, said allthat remained for final approval was the filing of a flight planwith the State Department.   Iraklij Chichiabaja, Aeroflot district manager in Washington,D.C., also said tentative clearance has been given for the planes toland at the base.   The effort was started by Seattle firefighters Dan Gomez andSteve Beaumont within days of the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed anestimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 homeless.   The cost of the shelters is $8,000 to $11,000 each.   Kirk Ohanessian, chairman of the local Armenian Church parishcouncil who has volunteered to go as translator, said the councilwas trying to raise $64,000 to help finance eight more units.   ``You can save all the lives you want, but you're going to havemore people die if they don't have a place to live,'' Ohanessian.</TEXT></DOC>
