FialkaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Idaho Senate candidate John V. Evans decided he needed to raise big out-of-state money for his race last year, he went to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations.    Despite the initials in its name, &quot;AIPAC emphasized constantly that they were not a PAC (political action committee),&quot; which gives money to candidates, says Mr. Evans, a Democrat and former governor. &quot;But they noted that there were Jewish organizations all over the country that had their own PACs and that if we would contact them, they would be able to help us.&quot;    Indeed, AIPAC did much better than an ordinary PAC could do for Mr. Evans. By federal law, a PAC is limited to a maximum contribution of $5,000 per race, and groups that coordinate their spending are counted as one PAC under this limit. But AIPAC steered Mr. Evans to a series of supposedly independent organizations -- many of them run by people with ties to AIPAC -- that gave him $204,950 for his losing race against Republican Sen. Steve Symms.    According to a computer-aided analysis of 1986 Federal Election Commission reports, despite AIPAC's claims of non-involvement in political spending, no fewer than 51 pro-Israel PACs -- most of which draw money from Jewish donors and operate under obscure-sounding names -- are operated by AIPAC officials or people who hold seats on AIPAC's two major policy-making bodies. The study shows that 80 pro-Israel PACs spent more than $6.9 million during the 1986 campaigns, making them the nation's biggest-giving, narrow-issue interest group.    The analysis shows that three of seven &quot;regional chairpersons&quot; at AIPAC direct PACs and 26 more PAC chairmen or treasurers sit on AIPAC's 131-member executive committee, which meets four times a year and sets overall lobbying strategy. Twenty-two more PAC leaders hold seats on a second, advisory body, the 200-member national council.    While the pro-Israel PACs represent diverse and supposedly bipartisan Jewish communities in almost every major city and region in the country, their spending patterns are remarkably similar. For example, of $3.9 million given directly to candidates, the pro-Israel PACs focused their power on three Senate races, spending $642,000 on Democrats in South Dakota, Idaho and California. In these races, only one $5,000 donation went to a Republican.    AIPAC leaders, including its executive director, Thomas A. Dine, refused repeated requests for interviews on the group's relationship with the pro-Israel PACs. Reading from a prepared statement, an AIPAC spokeswoman says the group &quot;denies most forcefully that any such (spending) coordination occurs,&quot; and insists that the interlock with pro-Israel PAC leaders &quot;is a function of the nature of political activism and in no way connotes affiliation or connection.&quot;    But the overlaps between the organization and the pro-Israel PACs begin at the top. For instance, the Los Angeles-based Citizens Organized Political Action Committee was founded by the wife of AIPAC's chairman, Lawrence J. Weinberg. And Citizens Concerned for the National Interest, located in Chicago, was started by Robert H. Asher, AIPAC's president. Neither could be reached for comment.    Both AIPAC and the pro-Israel PACs were keenly interested in the tight 1986 California Senate race between incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston, a staunch supporter of Israel, and Republican candidate Edwin Zschau. Last September, three AIPAC staff members -- regional director Murray Wood, lobbyist Dan Cohen and intern Michael Tuchin -- met at AIPAC's Los Angeles office with Breck McKinley, a Libertarian Party candidate.    During the meeting, according to Mr. McKinley, Mr. Cohen offered to get him a campaign manager and to finance a direct-mail campaign for him in heavily Republican Orange County. Mr. McKinley, who at that time had earmarked $350 to spend on his campaign, asserts that Mr. Cohen's &quot;stated purpose was to get Zschau&quot; by siphoning votes away from him. After considering the offer, Mr. McKinley says, he decided to reject any assistance.    Messrs. Cohen, Wood and Tuchin didn't respond to phone calls on the subject. Meanwhile, AIPAC's spokeswoman confirms that a meeting took place, but calls it a &quot;routine&quot; contact that AIPAC staff members make with many candidates and asserts that no offer of campaign aid was ever made.    The race that experienced the biggest influx of pro-Israel PAC money was the Senate race in South Dakota, where Democratic Rep. Thomas Daschle's successful campaign received $229,480. The PACs and people associated with them spent another $91,000 to help the state's Democratic Party finance an unprecedentedly lavish get-out-the-vote drive, including computerized voter lists, statewide phone banks and paid operatives who scoured remote Indian reservations for Democrats needing a ride to the polls.    The effort on behalf of Mr. Daschle infuriated Stanford M. Adelstein, a Rapid City developer, a former AIPAC executive committee member -- and a Republican. &quot;I'm angry. I really, in a sense, gave up on AIPAC,&quot; says Mr. Adelstein, who estimates that half of the state's 150 Jewish families are Republican.    Mr. Adelstein says he went to great lengths to get Jewish contributors to listen to incumbent GOP Sen. James Abdnor, and he helped arrange the senator's midcampaign trip to Israel, where Mr. Abdnor promised to soften his long-held stand against all foreign aid. But Mr. Abdnor was unsuccessful in stemming the flow of funds to his opponent.    Mr. Abdnor wasn't the only target of pro-Israel money to visit Israel last year; Mr. Zschau and Sen. Symms also made trips there and had warm praise for Israeli leaders and their prospects for future U.S. aid. The pro-Israel PAC money, however, went almost unanimously against them.    Leaders of the pro-Israel PACs who also hold high positions in AIPAC deny that their two roles overlap. What happens with the campaign money, they insist, is the result of local PACs making entirely independent decisions. For instance, Jeffrey L. Berkowitz, the head of the Miami-based National Action Committee PAC and a member of AIPAC's executive committee, says that when the committee meets in Washington, matters involving the pro-Israel PACs never come up.    &quot;We don't discuss that. It happens to be illegal to work cooperatively. We discuss politics in general terms,&quot; says Mr. Berkowitz, a lawyer and real estate developer. He says it is a &quot;coincidence&quot; that his and the other 28 PACs represented on the executive committee so often agreed on what candidates to back. &quot;I don't give a damn what the other PACs are doing. When I lobby I do it on behalf of 400 members of NACPAC,&quot; he asserts.    &quot;AIPAC is not involved,&quot; says Betty Chrustowski, a member of AIPAC's executive committee who also is treasurer of Badger PAC, which operates in the Milwaukee area. &quot;This is a community PAC.&quot; Ms. Chrustowski admits, however, that she is aware of the donation patterns of the other pro-Israel PACs. &quot;When you're politically active you kind of get a feel for what's going on.&quot;    &quot;I've never been in a meeting where we discuss who we're endorsing and why we're endorsing,&quot; explains Donald G. Linker, a member of AIPAC's executive committee and the chairman of the San Franciscans for Good Government PAC during the 1986 campaign. &quot;Because of my role with AIPAC I'm better informed. It's just like being informed citizens and taking information from one organization and giving it to another.&quot;    ---           BIGGEST NARROW-ISSUE PACs                                     1985-1986                                   Expenditures    80 Pro-Israel PACs             $6,931,728    Realtors' national    and State PACs                  6,290,108    American Medical Assn.    national and state PACs         5,702,133    National Rifle Assn.
