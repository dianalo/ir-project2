To the astonishment of cynics, he took action instead _ jailingoil union leaders, stockbrokers and dozens of drug-running police oncorruption charges.   But his message hasn't penetrated Mexico's bureaucracy, where abribe still can be expected to renew a visa, obtain a trade permitor connect a telephone line.   ``Now, there's confusion,'' said one business analyst. ``Peoplebelieve Salinas' people are clean, but they're still dealing withsome of the same middle-level officials. They don't know what todo.''   For most public servants, the opportunity to earn a decent wagecomes once in a lifetime. With no career civil service and no meritsystem guaranteeing promotions, tens of thousands lose their jobs ateach change of administration.   While padding slim government incomes is not unique to Mexico,under the authoritarian system that has governed the country sincebefore the time of the Spanish Conquest, corruption spread wellbeyond the economic arena.   It has hurt the nation's pride, tarnished elections and in someinstances claimed lives. An internal government study estimated thatfederal highway police bribes cost the economy $3 million a day.   ``The authoritarian nature of government lends itself tocorruption,'' said Samuel del Villar, an adviser to former PresidentMiguel de la Madrid and political scientist at the Colegio deMexico. ``Without accountability to the people, officials enjoy thediscretional authority to impose bribes and arbitrary fees.''   Salinas, inaugurated Dec. 1, inherited a monumental task from dela Madrid, who took office in 1982 amid growing perception thatcorruption _ fed by the sudden wealth to be had in the oil-boomyears _ was out of control and had infected the private sector.   ``To get the commerce department to authorize a price increasefor a product used to mean leaving an envelope behind,'' said thebusiness analyst, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``You'dtake up a collection from other businesses before you went.''   De la Madrid decreed a law, prepared by del Villar and a team oflegal experts, that extended criminal liability for corruptpractices by public servants. It was the heart of de la Madrid's``moral renovation'' campaign against corruption, and it failed.   ``Moral renovation failed because no one bothered to apply thepublic servants law,'' del Villar said. ``Indictments werediscretional, and in this case no one wanted to do it.''   Salinas abandoned ``moral renovation'' and ordered the arreststhat so far have netted Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, the longtimechief of the powerful oil workers union; Eduardo Legoretta, a topbusinessman charged with stock market fraud, and dozens of policeagents in northwestern Mexico alleged to have closed their eyes todrug trafficking.   Salinas' attorney general on April 27 ordered the arrest ofCarlos Robles Loustaunau, who stepped down as mayor of Hermosillo,and three aides on charges of getting themselves elected last Julythrough fraud. They are members of Salinas' own InstitutionalRevolutionary Party, commonly known as PRI, its Spanish initials.   Taking their cue from Salinas and his drive to modernize Mexico'seconomy, some Mexican business leaders have openly attacked officialbribe-taking.   ``We are tired of corruption,'' Jorge Ocejo Moreno, president ofthe National Association of Industries in Transformation, declaredin April.   Treasury, health, commerce and other federal department officials``extort us without end,'' he asserted.   To Salinas, both bureaucrats and private sector leaders are toblame for corruption that saps the economy and his own plans togenerate growth.   Salinas has promised measures to crack down on police corruptionand to professionalize Mexico's police forces.   As budget director under de la Madrid, Salinas helped change thesystem of import licenses that encouraged corruption; otherderegulatory changes have also helped reduce the number of rulesthat can lead to extortion or bribery.   Salinas also has laid down the law on chronic tax evasion bydecreeing a 2 percent tax on business assets. Vociferous businessprotests have been largely ignored.   Even so, the roll call of corruption in Mexico remains long andvaried:   _Proud host of the 1986 World Cup soccer championship, Mexicowon't field a team in the 1990 games. It was caught red-handed withfour over-age players in an international youth tourney last year.   _Salinas' own election was the most disputed in the 60-yearhistory of the PRI. Salinas won just over half the vote, but reportsabounded of multiple-voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud.   _Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico City in December orderedall car owners in the capital to have their vehicles tested to fightthe city's smog, generally considered the world's worst. Almostimmediately, inspectors began passing polluting cars for feesranging up to double the price of testing.   _Two Acapulco judges were suspended in December and face trial oncharges of accepting a $200,000 bribe to order the release fromprison of Alejandro Braun Diaz, a 34-year-old playboy convicted ofraping and killing a 6-year-old girl. Braun is believed to have fledto Canada.   _On Dec. 11, explosions and fire ripped through a crowded MexicoCity street market, killing 62 people. Residents blamed tons ofillegal fireworks sold at the market and said police had been bribedto ignore the threat. ``The government allowed them to sell here,''said a woman whose parents died in the blast.</TEXT></DOC>
