RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today asked the Bushadministration whether states should be allowed to regulate theshipment of hazardous substances by railroads.   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyersbefore deciding whether to review a ruling that such Ohioregulations are pre-empted by federal laws governing rail safety.   The justices are not expected to say whether they will reviewthe Ohio case until hearing from the government lawyers, whichcould take months.   Ohio's appeal to the high court was supported by nine otherstates, a nationwide alliance of state regulators and a railroadunion group. They urged the justices to overturn 6th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals ruling that invalidated Ohio's hazardous substancecontrols.   Leaving regulation of such shipments to the federal governmentis an invitation to disaster, the state officials said.   ``When rail hazardous materials accidents occur, the results canbe catastrophic,'' the officials said. They noted that billions oftons of dangerous substances are transported each year and saidfederal agencies lack the staffs or will to carry out adequateinspections and enforcement.   Supporting the Ohio appeal were Arizona, California, Louisiana,Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. TheNational Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners,representing officials in all 50 states, also urged the high courtto step in.   The Railway Labor Executives Association, representing therailroad unions, said the number of accidents involving trainscarrying hazardous material increased from 351 in 1987 to 517 lastyear.   The unions accused the Federal Railroad Administration of doinglittle to correct the problem, leaving regulation to the railroadsthemselves.   The unions said that if the 6th Circuit ruling were to applynationwide ``all railroads that transport hazardous materials andtoxic substances can effectively avoid compliance with any and allregulation.''   The 6th Circuit court has jurisdiction in Ohio, Kentucky,Michigan and Tennessee.   The appeals court last April ruled in favor of four railroadsthat challenged Ohio's regulations. The railroads are CSXTransportation Inc., Conrail, Norfolk and Western, and Grand TrunkWestern.   The appeals court said the Federal Railroad Safety Act strictlylimits the power of states to regulate rail safety. The awgenerally bars states from duplicating federal safety rules, theappeals court said.   But Ohio and the other states argued that a second federal lawspecifically gives the states power to control shipments ofhazardous material by any form of transportation, includingrailroads.   Ohio officials said that law, the Hazardous MaterialsTransportation Act, established a dual system of federal-stateregulation. State rules must be consistent with federal regulationsunder the law, the Ohio attorney general's office said.   Ohio enacted its hazardous material control law after a 1986accident in which 15 cars on a Baltimore andamp; Ohio train derailed inMiamisburg, Ohio. A tank car containing phosphorous ruptured,causing $3.5 million in property damage and prompting evacuation ofsome 40,000 people.   A report on the accident by the National Transportation SafetyBoard said the Federal Railroad Administration had not exertedsufficient control over tank car safety.   The case is Public Utilities Commission of Ohio vs. CSXTransportation Inc., 90-95.</TEXT></DOC>
