Two other leaders of the July 10 demonstration in Nadaime, 27miles south of the capital Managua, were released last month becauseof poor health.   The day after the protest, the government expelled U.S.Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats inManagua. It also closed the opposition newspaper, La Prensa, and theofficial Roman Catholic radio station.   Washington responded by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador CarlosTunnermann and seven other Nicaraguan diplomats in Washington.   The Nicaraguan government alleged Melton was using the U.S.Embassy to direct a ``conspiracy'' against the government and thatthe media were ``orchestrating'' the ambassador's plan.   The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rebels, known asthe Contras, agreed March 21 to suspend offensive operations, buttalks aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year war are at an impasse.   One leader released Wednesday, Carlos Huembes, said as he leftgovernment custody, ``The only alternative in Nicaragua is the civicfight.'' He said imprisonment had not intimidated him.   A few family members and foreign correspondents were on hand whenthe prisoners were released. Pro-government reporters did not attend.   Suspended jail sentences for Huembes and Roger Guevara, of theNicaraguan Democratic Coordinate; Agustin Jarquin of the SocialChristian Party; and Miriam Arguello of the Nicaraguan ConservativeParty were based on charges that included causing public harm,inciting a disturbance and illegal assembly.   Arguello and Jarquin were released Nov. 15.   The other demonstrators released Wednesday were given 18-monthsentences.   The judge issued the order of conditional freedom because, ``They(the opposition leaders) don't have previous criminal records, theyhave good conduct records and their re-entry into society is not athreat.''   However, during the duration of their sentences, they will not beallowed to leave the country and political activities in Nicaraguawill be limited.   Defense attorneys appealed the sentence, saying it was unclear,and paid fines for their clients' release.   Guevara, for example, was forced to pay $406 for vehicle damagethat occurred during the demonstration.   Miriam Arguello called the punishment ``political revenge'' and``a judicial abberation.''</TEXT></DOC>
