William Dillon, 33, of Old Lyme, Conn., also agreed to cooperatewith federal investigators probing the alleged scheme to gain andtrade on advance knowledge of information due to appear in BusinessWeek's ``Inside Wall Street'' column.   Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. stockbroker, was chargedwith a single count of wire fraud in U.S. District Court inManhattan.   As a formality, he pleaded innocent before a federal magistratebut his attorney, Henry Putzel, and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giulianisaid Dillon subsequently would plead guilty.   Dillon also agreed to give up all profits and to plead guilty toa similar charge _ yet to be filed _ at federal court inConnecticut, prosecutors said.   He faces a maximum five-year prison sentence and $250,000 fineon each wire fraud count.   The U.S. attorney in Connecticut, Stanley A. Twardy Jr., saidDillon agreed to cooperate with the investigation into securitiestrading by people using information misappropriated fromMcGraw-Hill Inc., publisher of Business Week, and R.R. Donnelley andamp;Sons Co., which prints the magazine.   Seven Donnelley employees have been fired or have quit since theprinter began an in-house investigation.   Dillon was charged with using the telephone in conjunction withthe inside information to buy 3,000 shares of Regency ElectronicsInc. common stock in January 1987.   Federal court documents stated that, all told, Dillon allegedlypurchased 129 different securities between May 1986 and last month,making some $94,000 in profits.   Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, whose brokerage account atanother firm allegedly was used for making trades on the insideinformation, will have to give up her profits, although officialshad placed no fixed sum on that amount, Giuliani said.   Giuliani said that as part of Dillon's cooperation agreement,his mother would not be charged with wrongdoing.   Merrill Lynch fired Dillon, a financial consultant in its NewLondon, Conn., office, late last month.   The dismissal came a week after Business Week said it wasprobing pre-publication trading linked to ``Inside Wall Street.''The Securities and Exchange Commission and the major stockexchanges also have launched investigations.   At the time, Merrill Lynch said Dillon was fired after companylawyers uncovered records suggesting stocks might have been boughtand sold on tips from articles due to be published in the magazine.   Court papers indicated Dillon and an unidentified person paidvarious Donnelley employees $20 to $30 an issue for advance copiesof Business Week on Thursday mornings. The magazine generally wasmade available to the public after the markets closed Thursdayafternoons.   Dillon was accused of trading Thursday mornings on thesecurities of companies that got a favorable mention in ``InsideWall Street.''</TEXT></DOC>
