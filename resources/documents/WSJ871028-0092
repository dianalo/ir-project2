For the past two years, Peru has tried to devalue its currency, the inti, as rarely as possible. But officials said the latest devaluations didn't indicate a departure from its underlying economic principles.    &quot;Heterodoxy hasn't failed,&quot; said Jorge Chavez, government director of economic affairs, in a reference to the controversial economic program Peru has followed since President Alan Garcia took office in July 1985. &quot;What is happening is the heterodox model wasn't applied as it should have been.&quot; He said the Garcia economic program is entering its &quot;second phase.&quot;    Under Peru's new foreign-exchange system, there will be seven official exchange rates for imports and exports, ranging from 15.93 intis to the dollar to 35 intis to the dollar. Official exchange rates for exports will be changed every month. Exchange rates for imports will be changed from time to time.    Under the old system, there were 12 exchange rates for imports and exports, ranging from 15.85 intis to the dollar to 28.95 intis to the dollar.    Lowering the foreign-exchange value of a country's currency make its products cheaper for foreign buyers, encouraging exports, while imports become more expensive and are thereby discouraged.    Under Peru's two-year-old economic program, Peru froze prices, lowered interest rates and tried to keep wages ahead of inflation. Last Friday, the government raised the minimum wage and announced other pay increases of as much as 30%.    On the assumption that past currency devaluations had caused damaging inflationary expectations, the government also tried to freeze exchange rates as much as possible. By this fall, Peru had more than a dozen official and unofficial exchange rates. The government now feels that those rates aren't flexible enough, and that the multitiered system was creating confusion.    &quot;We tricked the enemy too much,&quot; said Mr. Chavez, meaning the government had gone too far in its effort to wipe out businessmen's inflationary expectations. &quot;There are too many indicators, and there's a sense of disorder. Now we no longer have to stabilize but to adjust.&quot;    Many economists feel Peru has waited too long to shift gears. Indeed, according to the International Monetary Fund's exchange-rate formula based on the consumer price indexes of Peru's trading partners, Peru's exchange rate should be 34.4 intis per dollar.    In addition to the currency adjustments, Peru named Pedro Coronado, a lawyer, as central bank president. Mr. Coronado is a member of the ruling party and until taking his new post was chief of staff to the cabinet. The central bank has had an interim president since July, when its then-president, Leonel Figueroa, resigned over policy differences with other government officials. </TEXT></DOC>
