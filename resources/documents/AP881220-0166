The reports may lend credence to a rebel claim that Moscow isready to negotiate the demise of the government it has supportedwith more than 100,000 soldiers. About half the troops have beenwithdrawn under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 and therest are to be gone by Feb. 15.   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party Afghan insurgentalliance based in Pakistan, told a news conference over the weekendhe felt Moscow was ready to abandon its allies in Kabul.   Rabanni led the guerrilla delegation to the Dec. 3-5 talks withYuli Vorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Dec. 3-5 inTaif, Saudi Arabia. A second round is to be held in Islamabad laterthis month.   Vorontsov told the guerrillas the Soviets ``don't want thepresent regime'' in Kabul, Rabbani said.   Diplomats in Islamabad said privately some members members of theruling party in Kabul accused Vorontsov of a sellout, but one quoteda deputy minister as saying the ``regime would accept any solutionwhich did not require all party members to be exiled to theU.S.S.R.''   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communistcoup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country inDecember 1979.   Diplomats say about 10,000 Communist Party members and theirfamilies have left Kabul since the Soviet withdrawal began May 15.</TEXT></DOC>
