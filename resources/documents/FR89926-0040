Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a requestthat part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of itsbusiness proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department willreturn such comments and material to the person submitting the commentsand will not consider them in the development of final regulations.All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room H-4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and ConstitutionAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including writtenpublic comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published inpart 4 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

It would ensurethat the regulations fully reflect the Department's current interpretations,policies and practices. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis isnot required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The proposed rule involves a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0012.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Department, through the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, is responsiblefor enforcement of the antiboycott provisions of the Export AdministrationAct (the Act). The Act encourages, and in some cases requires, U.S. personsto refuse to participate in foreign boycotts that the United States doesnot sanction. U.S. persons are also required to report receipt of boycott-relatedrequests. The antiboycott provisions of the Act are implemented by 15 CFRpart 769 of the Export Administration Regulations (the regulations). Examplesaccompany the text of the regulations.This proposed rule would revise and clarify some of the current provisionsof the regulations that the Department has found are still debated or confusing.In addition, the proposal would remove references and provisions dealingwith effective dates and grace periods which have become moot with thepassage of time.Section 769.1 DefinitionsSection 769.1(d) (18) and (19) define ``activities in United States commerce''based on the circumstances surrounding implementation of letters of credit.These definitions are used to determine whether the jurisdictional requirementsfor the prohibitions and reporting requirements in part 769 of the regulationsare met. Section 769.2(f), which prohibits the implementing of lettersof credit containing prohibited conditions, defines the circumstances inwhich a letter of credit is in United States commerce and subject to theprohibition of this section. Section 769.1(d)(20) references andSection;769.2(f), stating that one should look to andSection; 769.2(f) to determinewhether implementing a letter of credit is ``covered by this part.'' Theproposed rule would revise this reference by replacing the words ``thispart'' with ``the prohibition of andSection; 769.2(f)''.The Department proposes two changes in the ``intent'' provisions of theregulations, andSection; 769.1(e). The changes would clarify the descriptionof the rule's applicability and remove an example.The first change would involve the statement in andSection; 769.1(e)(3) that``Intent is a necessary element of any violation of this part.'' Some haveargued that, by its general reference to ``any violation of this part,''the statement incorporates intent as an element of violations of andSection;769.6, the reporting requirement. It is clear from the Act and the regulationsthat the intent requirement applies only to prohibited conduct. No actiondesignated as ``prohibited'' violates the law unless it is taken with the``intent to comply with, further, or support'' an unsanctioned foreignboycott. The intent requirement is set forth in section 8(a) of the Act.The obligation to report, however, arises from section 8(b)(2). Section769.1(e)(3) of the regulations was adopted when part 769 included onlythe prohibitions in andSection; 769.2. When the reporting requirements inandSection; 769.6 were later revised to reflect the requirements of the ExportAdministration Amendments of 1977, the language of andSection; 769.1(e)(3)was apparently overlooked and not changed. The proposed rule would revisethe general statement in paragraph (e)(3) to make it clear that intentis an element only of any violation of the prohibitions set forth in andSection;769.2 of the regulations.The second change to the intent provision would be the removal of example(ix). The example has little practical significance and may lead to unnecessaryconfusion concerning the meaning of the intent requirement. On balance,the Department believes the example should be removed rather than revised.Section 769.2 ProhibitionsA number of changes proposed to andSection; 769.2, which defines prohibitedconduct. Under andSection; 769.2(c), which prohibits furnishing certain informationabout race, religion, sex or national origin, example (vii) states thata U.S. company may furnish certain information about the nationality ofits officers or directors. The example, however, is misleading because,while furnishing the information does not violate andSection; 769.2(c), itdoes violate andSection; 769.2(d)_the prohibition on furnishing informationabout business relationships. See particularly, example (xvi) to andSection;769.2(d). The proposal would make clear that, although the furnishing ofinformation described in example (vii) would not violate andSection; 769.2(c),it would violate andSection; 769.2(d). (The proposal would also note that,depending upon the circumstances, the furnishing might fall within oneof the exceptions contained in andSection; 769.3.)A number of relatively minor changes are proposed in andSection; 769.2(d)in examples illustrating the prohibited nature of furnishing informationabout the blacklist status of suppliers or affiliates. It has been erroneouslyargued that, where a supplier or affiliate is not blacklisted, a firm'sstatement of that fact does not supply information of a type prohibitedby andSection; 769.2(d). The regulatory changes are designed to make clearthat any furnishing of information about the blacklist status of othersis prohibited. The revised examples emphasize that, even where a firm'ssupplier or affiliate is not blacklisted, the firm's statement that theyare not blacklisted is prohibited because it furnishes information thatthe firm is not dealing with a blacklisted firm.Section 769.3 Exceptions to ProhibitionsThe proposed rule would not make any substantive changes to the exceptionsin andSection; 769.3, but would only clarify regulatory language or eliminatemisleading references in examples or text.The change proposed in andSection; 769.3(a-2) would be the addition of anew example which would emphasize that the exception does not permit compliancewith restrictions on the use of blacklisted vessels, but is limited torestrictions on the use of vessels of boycotted countries.The major changes for andSection; 769.3(b) would be the clarification ofthe text and several examples concerning the permissibility of furnishinginformation about firms. Section 769.3(b) permits, among other things,U.S. persons to furnish or agree to furnish the names of carriers, manufacturersand suppliers of services in the narrow context of complying with the importand shipping document requirements of a boycotting country relating tothe shipment of goods to that country. All information must be stated inpositive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms unless it is the nameof the carrier or the route of shipment. Information concerning the carrieror route of shipment may be supplied in negative terms in order to complywith boycotting country requirements protecting against war risks or confiscation.The Department has long taken the position that furnishing informationabout the nationality of a carrier or residence of a given firm on importor shipping documents relating to a shipment to a boycotting country ispermissible in view of the primary boycott objectives underlying such documentrequirements. See andSection; 769.3(a-1) and (a-2). Also, the Departmenthas maintained that the nationality of a carrier may be supplied in negativeterms. This information relates to requirements protecting against warrisks or confiscation. The proposed rule would codify these longstandingpolicies and interpretations.Section 769.8 Grace Period and Effective DatesSections 769.2(d), 769.2(f), 769.3(a-1), 769.3(b) and 769.4 contain referencesto a June 21, 1978 effective date for certain of the prohibitions and tothe grace period in andSection; 769.8, which delayed application of the regulationsto certain contracts or agreements. The grace period was until December31, 1978 or, on a case-by-case basis, until some date not later than December31, 1979.These effective dates and grace periods no longer cover activity that wouldbe subject to the initiation of enforcement actions. The statute of limitationsapplicable to the Act and regulations is five years and it is now morethan five years after the effective date and grace period. The proposalwould remove the references to and revise or remove provisions dealingwith the effective date and grace period.Section 769.6, which contains the reporting requirements for the receiptof boycott-related requests, includes provisions concerning requests receivedbefore June 30, 1979. The proposal would remove these provisions from andSection;769.6(b)(4)(i) and (ii). Violations of these provisions would be beyondthe period of the statute of limitations.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 769</ITAG>Boycotts, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Restrictivetrade practices, Trade practices.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 15 CFR part 769 would be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 769_RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES OR BOYCOTTS</ITAG>1.
