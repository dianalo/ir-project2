The welding jig is rotatable through 180.degree. to move the      blade into a second tacking position and a mechanism is provided for      turning every other small plate removed from the magazines through      180.degree. so that it is transferred into the second tacking position for      being tack welded to the other active face of the blade shoulder.      Operation of the apparatus is controlled automatically by a suitable      control device. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to an apparatus for achieving a spot-welded      connection between small wear plates and a shoulder or fin of a turboshaft      engine blade, and also to an automated process using the apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  As is generally known in the construction of turboshaft aero-engines,      blades of the engine may have a part, i.e. a shoulder or intermediate      shoulder, also termed a fin, intended to limit the deflections which may      be caused by vibrations of the blade. In order to prevent premature wear      of the facing surfaces of the shoulders or fins of two adjacent blades, it      is known to deposit on the faces a coating suited to the particular      conditions of operation for each application, and exhibiting good      frictional resistance characteristics, in particular. In addition, EP-A-0      140 736 mentions for the same purpose the use of small plates secured by      welding on the edges of adjacent sectors of stator blades. </PAR><PAR>  Refining the manufacture of this type of blade has led, in particular, to      providing for the mounting of these added members or small plates on the      active faces of the blade shoulder by using a known method of the      brazing-diffusion type carried out following a thermal cycle in a vacuum      treatment furnace. EP-A-0 075 497, for example, describes the technical      characteristics and aspects of this operation, particularly where the      added member is made of a self-brazable material not requiring the use of      a supplementary material at the interface of the elements being joined. </PAR><PAR>  In the manufacture of a blade comprising, in particular, the fitting of      added members on the active faces of the shoulder or fin of the blade,      problems are posed by the preparation steps for the fixing of these      members. The invention is concerned with solving these problems, and      particularly at obtaining, through the use of an automated process and      appropriately adapted apparatus, good repeatability for satisfactory      product quality as a result of correct and precise positioning of the      members, as well as a lower manufacturing cost. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  According to the invention, there is provided an apparatus for the      automated tacking of small plates on faces of a shoulder or fin of a      turboshaft engine blade by resistance welding, comprising a welding      electrode; an earth electrode; a welding jig for the blade, said jig      comprising a rigid support element for cooperating with two faces of said      blade shoulder or fin, a flexible support element for cooperating with two      faces of the root of said blade, blade clamping means; a manipulator for      moving said blade to and from said welding jig; means for rotating said      welding jig and said blade supported thereby through 180.degree.;      magazines for containing a plurality of said small plates; a cylinder      carrying said magazines; means for removing said small plates one by one      from said magazines; means for rotating every other one of said small      plates removed from said magazines through 180.degree. about an axis      parallel to the generatrices thereof; means for transferring each of said      small plates removed from said magazines to a tack welding position on a      face of said blade shoulder or fin; and control means for causing said      apparatus to carry out automated tacking cycles wherein two of said small      plates are welded on said shoulder or fin of each blade. </PAR><PAR>  Also according to the invention there is provided an automated process for      tack welding small plates on a shoulder or fin of a blade using the      apparatus of the invention, comprising the following steps: </PAR><PAR>  a) identifying the type of blade; </PAR><PAR>  b) using said manipulator to position a blade on said welding jig in a      first tacking orientation; </PAR><PAR>  c) supplying a first small plate in a first tacking orientation from said      magazines carried by said cylinder; </PAR><PAR>  d) positioning and tacking said first small plate on said blade on said      welding jig; </PAR><PAR>  e) rotating said welding jig supporting said blade through 180.degree. to a      second tacking orientation; </PAR><PAR>  f) supplying a second small plate as in step c; </PAR><PAR>  g) rotating said second small plate into a second tacking orientation; </PAR><PAR>  h) positioning and tacking said second small plate on said blade on said      welding jig in said second tacking orientation; and, </PAR><PAR>  i) removing said blade fitted with said small plates from said welding jig      using said manipulator. </PAR><PAR>  Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from      the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention,      with reference to the attached drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic top view of      apparatus for tacking small plates on the shoulders of blades in      accordance with one embodiment of the invention. </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 2,3 and 4 are diagrammatic representations of three steps in the use      of the apparatus of FIG. 1, showing respectively the setting of a blade in      position, the tacking/welding of a small plate to the blade, and removal      of the fitted blade. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 are diagrammatic representations of the parts of the      apparatus shown in FIG. 1 which are used for setting the small plates in      position. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7 and 8 show diagrammatically details of the tacking of first and      second small plates, respectively, on the shoulder of a blade. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The automated apparatus for tacking/welding small plates on the shoulder of      a turboshaft engine blade shown diagrammatically in FIG. 1 may be      associated with known equipment for cleaning/washing and drying the      components, and only the output station 1 of this equipment is shown in      the drawing. </PAR><PAR>  Supply of the blades 2 to the welding station of the apparatus is effected      from a station comprising a calibration and step-by-step feed mechanism 3      using a manipulator 4 equipped with gripping clamps 5 as shown      diagrammatically in FIGS. 2 and 4. At the welding station the blade 2 is      placed on a welding jig 6 which comprises, as shown diagrammatically in      FIGS. 2,3, and 4, a rigid support member 7 for two faces of the blade      shoulder 8, a flexible articulated support element 9 for two faces of the      blade root 10, and a device 11 for clamping the blade 2, for example by      means of springs. In the example shown in the drawings, the blades have a      shoulder with paired edges having three faces arranged Z-fashion, as may      be seen in FIGS. 7 and 8, the faces 12 and 13 of the shoulder bearing      against the tooling of the welding jig. </PAR><PAR>  At the time of welding, an earth electrode 14 is brought into contact with      the blade 2, the position reference of the blade 2 being provided by an      element 15 bearing on the inner side of the blade shoulder 8, whereas a      welding electrode 16 comes to bear on a small plate 17 to be welded on the      face 18 of the shoulder 8. </PAR><PAR>  The small plates 17 are supplied in magazines 19 which are arranged on a      rotary, magazine-carrying cylinder 20, and the removal of the plates is      effected by an actuator 29, a rotary spindle 21 effecting the reversal of      every other plate 17. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 show diagrammatically the components of the mechanism for      manipulating the plates 17, comprising a down conveyor 22 having an      actuator 23, a transfer conveyor 24 having an actuator 25 and a rod 26,      and a reversing station 27 for every other small plate having a rotary      actuator 28. </PAR><PAR>  The vertical displacement stroke of the conveyor 22 is represented by      symbol v in FIG. 5, and the transfer stroke for the plate 17 is      represented by symbol t. The position of the small plate relative to a      reference symbol r of the welding jig 6 is represented by symbol e and,      symbol s represents the welding reference plane. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus further comprises control means 30 which is of a type known      per se and therefore not described in detail. This control means governs      the operation of the automated tacking/welding cycles, successively      bringing into action the various parts of the apparatus which have been      described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus just described enables an additional member or small plate 17      to be firmly fixed accurately on each active face of a blade shoulder 8 by      means of spot welds, in order to facilitate manipulation of the blades in      the final stage of fitting the small plates on the blade shoulder, notably      by a diffusion brazing process in a vacuum treatment furnace. </PAR><PAR>  The automated process for tacking/welding small plates on a blade shoulder      using the apparatus as just described includes the following steps: </PAR><PAR>  a) identification of the type of blade; </PAR><PAR>  b) positioning the blade 2 in a first tacking orientation on the welding      jig 6 by means of the clamps 5 of the manipulator 4, such as      diagrammatically shown in FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  c) supplying a first small plate 17 in a first tacking orientation from a      magazine 19 situated on the cylinder 20; </PAR><PAR>  d) positioning and tacking the first small plate 17, as diagrammatically      shown in FIGS. 3 and 7; </PAR><PAR>  e) rotating the welding jig 6 supporting the blade 2 through 180.degree. to      a second tacking orientation; </PAR><PAR>  f) supplying a second small plate 17 as in previous step c; </PAR><PAR>  g) rotating the second small plate 17 to a second tacking orientation </PAR><PAR>  h) positioning and tacking the second small plate 17, as shown      diagrammatically in FIG. 8; and </PAR><PAR>  i) returning the blade 2 fitted with a small plate 17 on each active face      of the blade shoulder by means of the clamps 5 of the manipulator 4, such      as shown diagrammatically in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAL>  Automating the apparatus in the manner described permits precise      positioning of the blade and the small plates to be fitted thereto, with      absorption of geometrical differences of the parts arising from preceding      manufacturing operations, both blade machining and plate manufacture,      particularly by a known reaction sintering or self-brazing process. </PAL><PAR>  Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention      are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be      understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may      be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
