After that her milk supply will dwindle until she givesbirth again. Hormones could be used instead of live births to keep the milkflowing, but they don't work as well and aren't used in this country.;   Dairy cows are typically milked for 10 months and then given a two-month rest,according to Donald Bath, a dairy specialist with the University of CaliforniaExtension at University of California, Davis. To keep them on this schedulethey must give birth to a calf once a year.;    A dairy cow is first bred whenshe is about 15 months old, Bath said. When she has her first calf, ninemonths later, her milk-producing career begins.;    Non-dairy cows such asbeef cattle produce a gallon or so of milk a day, enough to feed their nursingcalves for the first few months of life. After several months the calves stopnursing, and the cows' milk stops flowing.;    But dairy cows are bred toproduce as much as 10 gallons of milk a day, much more than their calves need.The calves are usually taken from the cows after birth and bottle-fed on theirmother's milk.;    Just as a regularly nursing calf keeps its mother's milkflowing, daily milking keeps the dairy cows' milk coming for about 10 months,said Bath. When her milk production drops, she is usually given a few month'srest before the birth of her next calf begins the process again.;    A cow maystay on such a schedule for 10 to 12 years, Bath said.; Q What are bulletproofvests made of, and how do they work?; A Most are made of a fabric woven fromKevlar, a synthetic fiber made by Du Pont whose chemical composition gives ita strength greater than steel. Kevlar's strength keeps it from breaking whenthe bullet hits, and the weave of the fabric serves to absorb and distributethe energy of the bullet's impact.;    If a bullet struck a vest woven fromcotton fibers, for example, the fibers would break under the bullet's impact,allowing the bullet through. The reason Kevlar fibers can keep a bullet out istheir tremendous strength, according to Alec Jason, a ballistics consultantwho has done research on bulletproof vests. A Kevlar fiber is five times asstrong as a steel fiber of the same weight.;    The weave of the fabric alsohelps to distribute the energy of the impact across the entire vest, sparingthe person wearing the vest from being injured by the force of the bullet'simpact.;    The vests are classified based on the type of bullets they canstop, according to Mike McCarey of Safariland, a Los Angeles company thatmanufacturers bulletproof vests. Class I vests will stop bullets from.38-caliber handguns, Class II will stop bullets from the higher-powered 9mmand .357 Magnum handguns, and Class IIIa will stop a .44 Magnum bullet.;   The classes differ in the number of layers of Kevlar fabric they contain. AClass II vest has 28 layers and weighs about three pounds.;    The lightweight and flexibility of the Kevlar vests enables police officers to wearthem routinely. But while it will stop handgun bullets, Kevlar fabric is nomatch for high-powered rifle fire.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARCIA BARINAGA, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910507  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  617  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 7, 199100128091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
