Ceco said the suit, which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court in September but served on the company last week, alleged that the management group's offering price of $50.50 a share in cash and debt was &quot;grossly unfair and inadequate&quot; and sought an injunction to halt the proposed buyout.    Under terms of the settlement, the suit by Three Bridges Investment Group will be dismissed and all claims released. In exchange, Ceco has agreed to pay the dividend of 20 cents a share on its common stock that was declared in October to all shareholders. The company said if the merger is completed after Wednesday, which is the record date of the dividend, shareholders as of that date will receive the dividend. If the merger is completed before Wednesday, stockholders as of the effective date of the merger will receive the dividend.    Ceco, a construction concern, said its board voted to approve the settlement to avoid the time and cost of further proceedings and to ensure that its shareholders have the opportunity to vote on the proposed merger at a special shareholders' meeting to be held Monday.    Ceco said it expects that the dividend will be paid on or about Jan. 2. and will be paid whether or not the merger is approved by Ceco holders or completed.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with debt that ultimately is paid with money generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
