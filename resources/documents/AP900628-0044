(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Candidates plotting strategy for the1992 presidential race shouldn't make plans quite yet to trade thesnows of Iowa and New Hampshire for California sunshine.   The nation's most populous state may not shift its presidentialprimary after all.   Four months ago, California was on the brink of shaking up thepresidential nomination system by making its primary one of theearliest in the country.   A bill to move the presidential primary from early June to thefirst Tuesday in March had passed both houses of the Legislature indifferent forms.   Some supporters were predicting that delegate-rich Californiawould overshadow Iowa and New Hampshire and become the first majorstop on the campaign trail for presidential hopefuls.   ``If you're a candidate running for president do you want to betrudging around in the snow or do you want to be in California?''asked Assemblyman Mike Roos, a Los Angeles Democrat.   But the early primary bill has been languishing in a two-houseconference committee since late February. The delay is blamed on adispute over when the state should hold its primary for state andcongressional candidates and by the press of other business.   Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat,said the bill has bogged down partly because ``everybody issuspicious that the other side is trying to get a partisanadvantage.''   He gives the legislation a 50-50 chance of becoming law.   Most legislators agree that the state should hold an earlierpresidential primary. The June primary is one of the latest in thenation, meaning that presidential nominations usually are wrappedup by the time Californians vote.   California voters have not played a key role in a nominationbattle since 1972, when George McGovern defeated Hubert Humphrey inCalifornia and went on to win the Democratic nomination.   If the early primary had been in effect in 1988, Californianswould have voted three weeks _ instead of four months _ after theNew Hampshire primary, giving themselves a big voice in determiningthe Republican and Democratic nominees.   Debate on the legislation has focused on whether the state andcongressional primary should still be held on the same day as thepresidential primary.   Under the proposed legislation, the state would continue to holdone primary _ in March in presidential election years and in Junein non-presidential years.   Democratic leaders support that approach, saying that otherwisevoter turnout would drop off for state and congressional races.   But Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy said members of hiscaucus won't support a consolidated March primary. They fear thatnew legislative districts drawn to reflect the 1990 census mightnot be in place in time for March 1992, and the current legislativedistricts favor Democrats.   Republican leaders want a March presidential primary and a stateand congressional primary in September, saying that would reducespending for legislative and congressional races.   Aides to the bill's chief author, Democratic Assemblyman JimCosta, say the conference committee may not meet on the disputeuntil August.   Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and could passthe legislation by themselves. But without substantial GOP supportthey could face a veto by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian thatthey couldn't override.   ``The governor has his signature and I don't think the governorwould do something that's opposed by a significant number ofRepublicans,'' Roberti said.</TEXT></DOC>
