Dotted along the highway leading from the Pakistani border to theAfghan capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapseof the Afghan army in the area as Moslem insurgents move in.   Guerrilla commanders say Afghan government forces began todisintegrate after Soviet troops pulled out of the area late lastyear under a total withdrawal plan now in its final days.   ``The communists are all gone. They are running for theirlives,'' said one guerrilla commander.   Tanks and armored personnel carriers destroyed by guerrillarockets stood abandoned in the center of the highway or lie inroadside ditches. Trucks and radio command vehicles stood wheretheir crews abandoned them.   Senior guerrilla commanders told a visiting journalist over theweekend that Afghan army forces in the area are surrounded in themajor city of Jalalabad and a few outlying towns. They claimgovernment troops are demoralized, that just a handful of diehardcommunists want to fight.   The Afghan army is composed mainly of ill-trained conscripts whoare unwilling to fight for the Soviet-backed Kabul government.Western intelligence estimates put its strength nationwide at 30,000troops.   Afghan army units around Jalalabad have put up little resistanceas the Red Army withdraws after nine years of propping up the Kabulregime.   Commander Abdul Zaher said the guerrillas expect Jalalabad tosurrender soon when its supplies run out, but would attack if thegarrison tried to hold out. The guerrillas, he said, wanted to avoidcivilian casualties.   The only sign of fighting were a few salvos from governmentartillery in the distance around Jalalabad, which is about 90 mileseast of Kabul. Guerrilla commanders said 12,000 insurgents weresurrounding Jalalabad, but there was little fighting.   ``When the communist government is destroyed the fighting willend,'' said Khial Nur, a commander of the guerrillas, most of whomare based in Pakistan. The insurgents are aided chiefly by Pakistanand the United States.   An Afghan army prisoner dressed in a ragged green uniformappeared dazed and shocked as guerrillas helped him walk to theirbase. ``He does not want to fight. We will look after him,'' saidone guerrilla.   Some of the abandoned Afghan army bases and security posts alongthe Kabul highway bore signs of heavy fighting. Walls had beenshatteered by mortar and rocket fire and were pocked withmachine-gun bullets.   Other installations were undamaged and appeared to have beenabandoned without a fight.   At Landhi Khyber, guerrillas relaxed in a sprawling Afghan armybase. Green Islamic flags with crossed swords fluttered from the topof the barracks and guerrillas prayed in the courtyard.   The burned-out wrecks of about 20 Afghan army trucks litteredwhat was once the motor pool. A few bits of green and khaki armyclothing lay on the ground, flung away by fleeing soldiers.   At Gerde Ghous, about 20 miles east of Jalalabad, guerrillasshowed off a captured barracks they said once housed 1,200government militia troops. Buildings were pocked with bullet holes.Two shattered tanks stood on the nearby highway, their guns pointingblindly into the air.   Guerrillas had crawled their names and Islamic slogans oncaptured army posts. ``Long live Islamic holy war,'' said a sloganat Ghazi Abad.   Insurgents wearing traditional baggy Afghan trousers, long shirtsand turbans perched on gutted tanks, yelling greetings to bands ofcompatriots who roared up the highway in trucks and buses. Islamicflags and posters were plastered on the wrecked army vehicles.   ``Dushman, dushman,'' beaming guerrillas shouted as they pointedto the tanks and other wrecked vehicles, using the Pushtu word forenemy.   All of the wrecked and abandoned army vehicles were Soviet-made.Operating instructions in Russian on metal plates were still boltedinside the turrets of burned out T-54 and T-55 tanks.   Captured army trucks still in working condition were being usedby the guerrillas to ferry men and supplies towards Jalalabad.Islamic banners fluttered from the trucks and pictures of guerrillaleaders were plastered on windshields.   Bands of guerrilla fighters with bandoliers of bullets acrosstheir chests and machine guns and rifles hanging from theirshoulders stood guard in every village and hamlet along the highway.   ``We are happy. Soon we will have Islamic government andAfghanistan will be free,'' said one of the guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
