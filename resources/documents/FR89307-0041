This freshwater mussel historicallyoccurred in the Ohio River and its large tributaries in Pennsylvania, WestVirginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Presently,the golf stick pearly mussel is known from four relict, apparently nonreproducing,populations_two reaches of the Tennessee River (one in the State of Kentuckyand one in the State of Tennessee), one reach of the Green River in Kentucky,and one reach of the Cumberland River in Tennessee. The distribution andreproductive capacity of this species has been seriously impacted by theconstruction of impoundments on the large rivers it once inhabited.

This freshwaterspecies, which is characterized as a large river species (Bates and Dennis1985), has a medium to large shell that is ovate to subquadrate in outline(Bogan and Parmalee 1983). The shell exterior lacks rays and has a yellow-greento brown color. Older individuals are usually darker brown or black. Theinside of the shell is salmon to deep purple surrounded by a white border.Like other freshwater mussels, it feeds by filtering food particles fromthe water. It has a complex reproductive cycle in which the mussel's larvaeparasitize fish. The mussel's life span, fish species its larvae parasitize,and other aspects of its life history are unknown.The golf stick pearly mussel has historically widely distributed in theOhio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River systems in Pennsylvania, West Virginia,Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee1983, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission 1980, Parmalee and Klippel 1982,Lauritsen 1987, Stansbery 1970). Based on personal communication with knowledgableexperts (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson, Tennessee Valley Authority,1987; Arthur Bogan, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, 1988; Arthur Clarke,Corpus Christi State University, 1986; Ronald Cicerello, Kentucky NaturalPreserves Commission, 1988; James Sickel, Murry State University, 1987;David Stansbery, Ohio State University, 1987) and a review of current literature(see above plus Sickel 1985), the species is known to survive in only fourriver reaches. The species still exists but apparently does not reproducein the Tennessee River in Livingston, Marshall, and McCracken Counties,Kentucky; the Tennessee River in Hardin County, Tennessee; the CumberlandRiver in Wilson, Trousdale, and Smith Counties, Tennessee; and the GreenRiver in Hart and Edmonson Counties, Kentucky.The continued existence of these four popoulations is questionable. Unlessreproducing populations can be found or methods can be developed to maintainthese or create new populations, the species will become extinct in theforseeable future. The individuals that do still survive in these fourriver reaches are also threatened from other factors. The Green River inKentucky has experienced water quality problems related to the impactsfrom oil and gas production in the watershed. The individuals still survivingin the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers are potentially threatened by graveldredging, channel maintenance, and commercial mussel fishing. Althoughthe species is not commercially valuable, incidental take of the speciesdoes sometimes occur during commercial mussel fishing for other species.The golf stick pearly mussel was recognized by the Service in the May 22,1984, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 21664) as a species that was being consideredfor possible addition to the Federal List of Endangered and ThreatenedWildlife and Plants. The species was a candidate placed in Category 2;such species are those for which information then in possesion of the Serviceindicates that a proposal is possibly inappropriate, but for which conclusivedata are still lacking to support such a proposal. On March 17, 1987, andOctober 27, 1987, the Service notified Federal, State, and local governmentalagencies and interested individuals by mail that a status review was beingconducted specifically on the golf stick pearly mussel and that the speciescould be proposed for listing. Since that time, additional contacts withFederal and State agency personnel and the scientific community have occurredconcerning the status and potentiality of the species' being protectedunder the Endangered Species Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgatged to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(A)(1). Thesefactors and their application to the golf stick pearly mussel (<T3>Obovaria retusa</T3>) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range The golf stick pearly mussel was once widespread in the Ohio River andits large tributaries in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana,Illinois, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). However, mostof the historically known populations were apparently lost due to conversionof many sections of these big rivers to a series of large impoundments.This seriously reduced the availability of preferred riverine gravel/sandhabitat, and it likely affects the distribution and availability of themussels' fish host. As a result, the species' distribution has been substantiallyreduced. The species was last taken in Pennsylvania in 1908 (Pennsylvania Departmentof Environmental Resources, personal communication, 1987). No live or freshdead specimens have been taken in West Virginia in recent years (WilliamTolin, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication, 1987). Accordingto a personal communication from Robert McCance, Jr., Ohio Department ofNatural Resources (1987), the last Ohio collection of the golf stick pearlymussel was made in 1938. In Indiana waters the species has not been collectedin decades (Max Henschen, Indiana Mollusk Technical Advisory Committee,personal communication, 1987). The Illinois Department of Energy and NaturalResources (Kevin Cummings, personal communication, 1987) reported thatthe species has not been collected in over 30 years from Illinois. The species is presently known from only four river reaches_two in Kentuckyand two in Tennessee. In Kentucky waters the golf stick has been takenin recent years only from the Tennessee River in McCracken, Livingston,and Marshall Counties and from the Green River in Hart and Edmonson Counties(Linda Andrews, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, andRonald Cicerello, personal communication, 1987). Kentucky's Tennessee Riverpopulation is represented by the collection of only two live individualsin recent years. One was taken in 1985 (Sickel 1985), and the other wascollected in 1986 (C. E. Moore, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, personalcommunication, 1987). In the Green River, only one fresh dead individualwas taken during a mussel survey between Munfordville, Kentucky, and MammothCave, Kentucky, in 1987 (Ronald Cicerello, personal communication, 1987).The last live specimen taken from the Green River was collected in themid-1960s (Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet,personal communication, 1987). In Tennessee the species apparently still survives in the Cumberland Riverin Wilson, Trousdale, and Smith Counties, and in the Tennessee River inHardin County. According to personal communication with knowledgeable individuals,the species is taken on rare occasions by commercial mussel fishermen fromboth these rivers (Paul Parmalee, University of Tennessee, personal communication,1986; Steven Ahlstedt, personal communication, 1987; Paul Yokley, Universityof North Alabama, personal communication, 1987). The four surviving populations are all threatened from impacts on theirenvironment. The Green River population is threatened from degradationof water quality resulting from inadequate environmental controls at oiland gas exploration and production facilities and from altered stream flowsfrom an upstream reservoir. The other populations are potentially threatenedby river channel maintenance, navigation projects, and gravel and sanddredging. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes Although the species is not commercially valuable, it does exist on harvestedmussel beds, and the species is therefore sometimes taken by mussel fishermen.Thus, take does pose some threat to the species. Federal protection wouldhelp to control the take of individuals. C. Disease or Predation Although the golf stick pearly mussel is undoubtedly consumed by predatoryanimals, there is no evidence that predation threatens the species. However,freshwater mussel die-offs have recently (early to mid-1980s) been reportedthroughout the Mississippi River basin, including the Tennessee River andits tributaries (Richard Neves, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and StateUniversity, personal communication, 1986). The cause of the die-offs hasnot been determined, but significant losses have occurred to some populations.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The States of Kentucky and Tennessee prohibit taking fish and wildlife,including freshwater mussels, for scientific purposes without a State collectingpermit. However, these States do not protect the species from take forother purposes. Federal listing will provide the species additional protectionunder the Endangered Species Act by requiring Federal permits to take thespecies and by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Service whenprojects they fund, authorize, or carry out may adversely affect the species.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors affecting its Continued Existence None of the four populations is known to be reproducing. Therefore, unlessreproducing populations can be found or methods can be developed to maintainthese or create new populations, the species will be lost in the foreseeablefuture. In fact, three of the populations (Cumberland and Tennessee Riverpopulations) may contain only old individuals that have passed their reproductiveage. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the golf stick pearly mussel (<T3>Obovaria retusa</T3>) as an endangered species. Historical recordsreveal that the species was once much more widely distributed in many ofthe large rivers of the Ohio River system. Presently only four isolated,apparently non-reproducing, populations are known to survive. Due to thespecies' history of population losses and the vulnerability of the fourremaining populations, threatened status does not appear appropriate forthis species. See the following section for a discussion of why criticalhabitat is not being proposed for the golf stick pearly mussel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for the golf stick pearly mussel at this time, owingto the lack of benefits from such designation. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineersand the Tennessee Valley Authority are the two Federal agencies most involved,and they, along with the State natural resources agencies in Tennesseeand Kentucky, are already aware of the location of the remaining populationsthat would be affected by any activities in these river reaches. Both Federalagencies have conducted numerous studies in these river basins and areknowledgeable of the fauna and of their projects' impacts. No additionalbenefits would accrue from critical habitat designation that would notalso accrue from the listing of the species. In addition, this speciesis so rare that taking for scientific purposes and private collection couldbe a threat. The publication of critical habitat maps and other publicityaccompanying critical habitat designation could increase that threat. Thelocation of populations of this species have consequently been describedonly in general terms in this proposed rule. Any existing precise localitydata would be available to appropriate Federal, State, and local governmentalagencies through the Service office described in the ``Addresses'' section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibition against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. TheService has notified Federal agencies having programs that may affect thegolf stick pearly mussel. Federal activities that could occur and impactthe species include, but are not limited to, the carrying out or the issuanceof permits for hydroelectric facility construction and operation, reservoirconstruction, river channel maintenance, stream alterations, wastewaterfacilities development, and road and bridge construction. It has been theexperience of the Service, however, that nearly all section 7 consultationshave been resolved so that the species has been protected and the projectobjectives have been met. In fact, the areas inhabited by the golf stickpearly mussel are also inhabited by other mussels that have been federallylisted since 1976, and all section 7 consultations for these areas havebeen successfully resolved.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take any listed species, importor export it, ship it in interstate commerce in the course of commercialactivity, or sell it or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce.It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or shipany such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions wouldapply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or forincidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In someinstances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to relieveundue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were notavailable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 100Otis Street, Room 224, Asheville, North Carolina 28801.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, needed not be prepared in connection with regulations adoptedpursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Bates, J.M., and S.D.
