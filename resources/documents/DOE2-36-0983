The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 313.17,353.15 and 393.15 Kelvin, and at pressures from 37 to 416 bar. Measurementsfor the mixtures were terminated when complete miscibility was observed.The Perturbed-Hard-Chain (PHC) equation of state developed by Gmehlinget al (1979) was chosen to correlate the measured data because of itsability to handle the complexity of the molecular interactions in themixtures. Binary interaction parameters were regressed for the carbondioxide - water and carbon dioxide - n-decane mixtures while those ofwater - n-decane were obtained from ternary data. A fiber-optic scopewas used to observe the number of phases present and qualitatively measurethe equilibrium liquid phase volumes. The measured data were then comparedto predictions from the model. Ternary diagrams are presented showingpredicted coexisting equilibrium phases for the three isotherms and severalpressures.</TEXT></DOC>
