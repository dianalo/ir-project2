A special master appointed by a panel of federal judgesrecommended Tuesday that the state set up a single governing boardfor higher education, raise admission standards for some schoolsand make Louisiana State University the primary research school.   The proposal also called for establishing a community collegesystem and providing a specific percentage of each year's highereducation budget for predominantly black colleges.   The plan generally was well received by state officials. ``Ithink the students won,'' said Gov. Buddy Roemer.   ``I'm for it if it will improve the education of our students inLouisiana, if LSU will be enhanced as the flagship university andif we can provide a good education for our young people at areduced cost,'' said Jack Andonie, chairman of the LSU Board ofSupervisors.   Louisiana currently has four boards of higher educationoverseeing 17 institutions. Under the plan proposed by SpecialMaster Paul Verkuil, president of William and Mary College inVirginia, those boards would merge into one unified governing bodywith 17 voting members and a student member.   Verkuil was appointed after black leaders, educators andpoliticians were unable to reach an agreement to end a 15-year-oldlawsuit brought against the state by the U.S. Justice Department.   Since December 1987, the state of Louisiana, the JusticeDepartment, Southern University and the Grambling AlumniAssociation have been trying to come up with a desegregationproposal after an earlier settlement expired.   Black leaders had feared a single higher education board wouldbe insensitive to the needs of Louisiana's two major predominantlyblack universities, Grambling State University in north Louisiana,and the Southern University System based in Baton Rouge.   Grambling is governed by the Board of Regents and Board ofTrustees, which oversees most of the predominantly whiteinstitutions. Southern has its own governing board.   A three-judge federal panel that appointed Verkuil will have thefinal say on the proposal.   The plan rejected the notion of closing or merging stateuniversities for the time being, perhaps the most dreaded aspect ofthe desegregation talks.   The governor got much of what the state wanted from thenegotiations, including the superboard, which he was unable to pushthrough the Legislature last year.   ``We asked that the schools not be closed, but that the boardsbe merged, and the master has done this,'' Roemer said. ``He gaveus some guidelines. Now we'll have to work with the Legislature tosee how much and how far he has gone.''   ``It may do for Louisiana what we could not do because of thepolitics of the circumstances,'' namely the competition among thecollege systems, said state Sen. Armand Brinkhaus, chairman of theSenate Education Committee.   Brinkhaus compared the situation to the public schooldesegregation fights of the 1960s when federal court ordersoverrode state law.   ``We need to integrate our colleges. All of our citizens need tohave the same opportunities,'' Andonie said. ``But I don't know ifthe plan is going to work.''   A representative of the Board of Trustees for State Colleges andUniversities said Verkuil has given the state an opportunity toproperly integrate its higher education institutions.   ``He has done it very wisely,'' said David McCormick, vicepresident for academic and research affairs. ``He did what thegovernor asked. He said, `Let me get my one board in place and givethat board the responsibility for doing these things.'''   Sally Clausen, commissioner of higher education, said, ``Myinitial reaction is this is probably the least disruptive set ofrecommendations that holds promise for desegregation and increasedaccessibility.''</TEXT></DOC>
