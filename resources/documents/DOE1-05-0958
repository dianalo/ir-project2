The Zimpro process, based on theearly work of Zimmerman has been practiced in the U.S. since the early1960's for the conditioning and oxidation of municipal sludge. The useof the deep well process configuration as a more satisfactory and economicalengineering approach to the application of wet oxidation concepts formunicipal wastewater treatment wastes began in 1975 with the USEPA supportof the Vertical Tube Reactor project in Longmont, Colorado. This papertraces the history of the development of subcritical deep well oxidationtechnology from 1975 through 1985, and describes an important extensionof this technology to achieve supercritical oxidation of municipal, industrialand hazardous waste in a deep well reactor. Supercritical water chemistryis briefly described along with the particular advantages of the deepwell reactor configuration for achieving the necessary reactor conditionsfor destruction of toxic and hazardous wastes.</TEXT></DOC>
