The company declined to disclose the size of the grant.</LP><TEXT>   Advanced NMR said its new magnetic resonance imaging, orMRI, system should offer several advantages over conventionalbreast screening with X-rays, including less discomfort, nopatient exposure to radiation and high-resolution picturesthat may make it possible to spot tumors earlier. The systemwill employ an MRI technology developed by Advanced NMR thatcan make images up to 20,000 times faster than conventionalMRI machines do, the company said. MRI employs magneticfields and radio waves to make pictures of internal tissues.   In conventional X-ray mammography, the breast iscompressed between two plates, sometimes causing pain anddiscouraging women from being screened as often as doctorsrecommend, said Paul D. Bullinger, president and chiefexecutive officer. Advanced NMR's new system won't requiresuch compression, he said.   Advanced NMR plans within 18 months to build a prototypeof the new system that will employ a &quot;new style,&quot; low-costmagnet customized for breast imaging, Mr. Bullinger said. Theestimated cost of the system will be less than $150,000,making it possible to provide breast images at a pricecompetitive with the $50 or so for an X-ray mammogram, headded.   Eventually, the company hopes its new system will providedata on localized blood flow and biochemical composition ofsuspected breast tumors, enabling doctors to tell quicklywhether they are benign or malignant without surgicalbiopsies, Mr. Bullinger said.   Mr. Bullinger said the company is now testing thefeasibility of using MRI for mammography with a conventionalsystem that has been altered for making breast images. Thesystem, however, is too costly for breast screening and won'thave the high resolution expected with the specializedmachine the company is developing, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
