(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA prepared to start the countdownfor the space shuttle Atlantis today despite the promise ofanti-nuclear activists to sit on the launch pad if necessary toblock a payload that carries radioactive plutonium.   Pending a federal judge's approval, Atlantis is to lift off at1:29 p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch thenuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft to explore the planet Jupiter.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided tobegin the count on schedule this morning even though a decision ispending on a lawsuit by three citizens' groups seeking a temporaryrestraining order to halt the launch. The groups contend that anexplosion on liftoff could spread cancer-causing plutoniumparticles over a large area of east-central Florida.   NASA officials say the two nuclear-powered generators aboardGalileo have been thoroughly tested and that flying them posesminimal health and environmental risks.   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch scheduled oral arguments on thesuit for Tuesday in Washington.   This is the first time anyone has gone to court to stop a spacelaunch.   The space agency said it could stop the countdown at the 11-hourmark for several days to await the judge's decision, if necessary.   The activists have said that if they lose in court, they willattempt to block the flight by infiltrating the launch areaThursday.   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit onthe launch pad,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the FloridaCoalition for Peace and Justice, one of the groups that filed thesuit.   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles andsemiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the Kennedy Space Center tostop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded byhelicopters and boats.   ``They indicated to us and to the press an intent to do someback-country-type activities to try to stop the launch,'' said GaryWistrand, deputy director of the space center's security office.``We are postured to try to prevent that.''   There is only a 10-minute launch period available on Thursday,and NASA is concerned the time could be consumed if protesterspenetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or on foot inthe final minutes of the countdown.   The astronauts who will fly the mission were to arrive here thisafternoon from their training base in Houston. All five said theyare not concerned about flying with plutonium.   ``I have absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' saidcommander Donald Williams.   The generators, each containing 24.7 pounds of radioactiveplutonium-238 dioxide, were installed Sunday in the Galileo probestored in Atlantis' cargo bay.   Officials said without nuclear power, spacecraft could notfunction at distant planets like Jupiter because they are too faraway to draw energy from the sun.   In a brief filed last week, the citizens' groups said thegovernment underestimated or covered up the danger of plutoniumcontamination from any shuttle explosion like the one thatdestroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986.   NASA responded that the organizations were spreading a ``tale ofhorrors,'' and that tests show the generators would survive aChallenger-like explosion.   The agency said similar generators have flown on 22 U.S. spacevehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and that inthree instances the well-protected devices survived severeaccidents _ two rocket blowups and a fiery re-entry through Earth'satmosphere.   The probability of a release of plutonium in a launchingaccident is less than 1 in 2,500, NASA said. The opponents put theodds at 1 in 430.</TEXT></DOC>
