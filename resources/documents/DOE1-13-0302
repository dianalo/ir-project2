<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0302 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Bureau of Mines, US Department of the Interior, is conducting atmosphericcorrosion tests on five alloys and two coated steel products at fivesites as part of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program.Samples tested are boldly exposed to the atmosphere, sheltered from theatmosphere, and facing skyward and groundward. Details of the corrosionprocess related to orientation and sheltering and involving particulates,corrosion film chemistry and morphology, and the dissolution/reprecipitationprocess were established. The corrosion film on zinc saturates with sulfurat -- 7 wt% with increasing ambient sulfur dioxide concentration. Zinccorrosion on the skyward side appears to be cathodically protected intwo-sided bold exposures. Only large particulates are present on thesurface of sheltered copper and zinc; small particulates dissolve anddisperse into the corrosion film. The dissolution/reprecipitation processoccurs primarily during the final stages of drying.</TEXT></DOC>
