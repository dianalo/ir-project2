For nearly two decades they have sat in their offices on Capitol Hill or in statehouses scattered across the country and watched as, primary by primary, their party's nominee was chosen. With the party's 1988 nomination prospects hopelessly muddled, however, they are girding to make their voices heard. This year they will have more than a voice.    The Democratic Party rules call for 645 of the party leaders to be convention delegates -- actually superdelegates -- and political analysts increasingly are pointing to them as the voice of reason, and perhaps even the balance of power, that may help resolve the Democratic-nomination battle.    &quot;If they go in one direction, they'll put someone over the top,&quot; says Mark Siegel, who as an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee is himself a superdelegate. &quot;If they scatter, they can cause a further muddle. But if they start to move in any significant numbers toward someone who is not now a candidate, they could start a movement.&quot;    For the past several weeks, these party leaders -- some of the most important names in Democratic politics -- have been spending hours on the telephone with people like Susan Brophy, Richard Hutcheson and Steven Murphy -- three unknown soldiers in the war of attrition to amass the support of superdelegates.    Superdelegate hunters for Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, respectively, they have been practicing a form of politics at its most personal level. Sometimes contact is daily.    &quot;The superdelegates are known quantities,&quot; says Mr. Hutcheson. &quot;You know the circles in which they move, the friends they have, the way they behave. There's no secret about how to get them: You call them, you get your candidate to call them, you get their friends and their colleagues to call them.&quot;    When Louisiana's new governor, Charles (Buddy) Roemer, endorsed Mr. Gore, Mr. Hutcheson and his staff swung into action and won the support of the state chairman and two other Democratic National Committee members from the state. The expected endorsement of Mr. Dukakis by New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley today could prompt a similar ripple effect.    Last week Mr. Dukakis, whose staff sometimes arranges for him to call 25 of the superdelegates at a sitting in a tireless search for support, nabbed four commitments in one day -- a &quot;high-kill ratio,&quot; in the words of one admiring aide.    In recent weeks the Rev. Jesse Jackson has been raising questions about the fairness of a process that permits party elders to influence the course of the nomination battle without regard to the choices of the public at the polls.    &quot;It's okay to have superdelegates, but there should be some controls on them,&quot; says Gerald Austin, Mr. Jackson's campaign manager. &quot;We're in a position where we could win the most popular votes and the most delegates and these party leaders could go into a room and choose someone else. It makes a burlesque of the process.&quot;    Mr. Austin argues that the superdelegates could violate the principle of one-man, one-vote. &quot;These superdelegates aren't picked based on any formula,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't think we're going to get a good shot at being represented.&quot;    The superdelegates were added to the convention rolls to ensure that professional politicians, who often found themselves ignored as the Democrats raced to nominate losing tickets, participate in the selection of the party nominee. The superdelegates include five &quot;distinguished former elected leaders,&quot; former President Jimmy Carter, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former House Speakers Carl Albert and Thomas O'Neill and former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.    &quot;We may just now be seeing the wisdom of ensuring the presence of elected officials in the convention,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, who heads the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. &quot;We'll have professionals who have a stake in the result helping to guide the decision of the party -- and that's good. We're approaching a situation where we'll need negotiation and compromise and cooperation, and elected officials are good at those things.&quot;    Some already have given commitments; Rep. Gephardt claims the public or private commitments of 80 House members. But the identity of the 252 congressional superdelegates won't actually be determined until April 20, and only recently, as the Gephardt campaign has dropped from the top of the Democratic race, have other campaigns ventured into the House to seek support.    &quot;There wasn't a lot of business to be done in the House,&quot; says an aide to one of Mr. Gephardt's rivals. &quot;But if Gephardt fades, then the House will be open in a way that it wasn't.&quot;    In the end, most of the superdelegates are likely to follow the peculiar political law of physics that draws public figures inexorably toward winners.    &quot;You get them by winning,&quot; says Thomas Donilon, who headed delegate operations for Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale. &quot;And if you can't get them that way, you get them by tenacity. You establish a relationship so that you can take advantage -- fast -- of your successes or that you can turn them by force of your argument.&quot;    So if Mr. Dukakis manages to win Saturday's caucuses in Michigan and regains the momentum in the race, his delegate hunters will try to close the deal with a number of potential supporters. &quot;When we get a win,&quot; says Tad Devine, director of delegate selection for the Dukakis campaign, &quot;we want to be ready.&quot;    Most of the superdelegates, however, will resist commitments. The 16 national committeemen from New York will probably follow Gov. Mario Cuomo, but their colleagues from Maryland will probably drift off in a way that defies pattern.    And some experts in delegate politics argue that the superdelegates won't play a major role at all.    &quot;They're going to act en masse to put someone over the top?&quot; asks Elaine Kamarck, who was deputy campaign manager for the since-abandoned campaign of former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. &quot;They can't decide who's going to be party chairman. It's a recipe for even more regional favoritism. Their hope is that someone else decides this so they won't have to.&quot;    Even so, the campaigns are fighting fiercely over this terrain. And with some of the campaigns in severe financial difficulty and on the brink of elimination, the candidates are wooing superdelegates who have made commitments to their rivals.    &quot;These calls are not an accident,&quot; Mr. Devine says. &quot;Dukakis isn't calling these people to say hello because he's got a few minutes free.&quot;    ---                     The Superdelegates    Category                                      Numbers    Democratic National Committee                   363    Members of Congress*                            252    Democratic Governors                             25    Distinguished former elected leaders              5    TOTAL                                           645    DELEGATES NEEDED FOR NOMINATION               2,082   *On April 20, Democrats in the Senate and the House will select four-fifths of their members to serve as convention delegates</TEXT></DOC>
