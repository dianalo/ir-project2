The conference began today at the Soviet diplomatic mission,U.S. spokesman Terry Shroeder said. He declined to give details.   The first full meeting of both delegations, headed by Sovietdisarmament official Viktor Karpov and the head of the U.S. ArmsControl and Disarmament Agency, Maj. Gen. William Burns, wasscheduled for Thursday.   The conference is expected to last for one or two weeks. Underthe ABM treaty, such meetings must be held every five years to giveboth sides a chance to list grievances.   The ABM treaty allows each side to deploy only one ABM systemand limits the types of systems that may be deployed. The theoryfor the agreement is that a potential aggressor would not launch anuclear attack if it faced the prospect of devastating retaliation.   The United States has maintained a Soviet radar underconstruction at Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, violates the treaty andmust be dismantled. The Soviets contend the U.S. Strategic DefenseInitiative, a research program aimed at creating a space-basedmissile defense, violates the treaty and should be limited.   According to an information sheet distributed by the U.S.mission, U.S. officials recently told the Soviets that unless theradar is dismantled, no agreement is possible at negotiations onreducing strategic nuclear forces, or START.   The START talks have been going on in Geneva since March 1985.Both sides agree in principle that strategic forces should bereduced by 50 percent.   As a condition for the START agreement, the Soviets have foryears demanded that the United States limit its Strategic DefenseInitiative.   The ABM treaty review opened in a low-key atmosphere followingearlier U.S. statements which hinted at a showdown over theKrasnoyarsk radar.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said this month thatafter hearing the Soviet position on Krasnoyarsk at the ABMconference, ``should the situation remain unresolved, the presidentwill consult with the Congress and our allies concerning nextsteps.''   One possible next step, according to the U.S. information sheet,would be for the United States to declare the radar a ``materialbreach'' of the treaty. This would open the way for the UnitedStates to terminate or suspend the treaty and then go beyond itslimits on the Strategic Defense Initiative.   A U.S. delegation statement issued Tuesday did not speak ofpossible retaliatory action.   Karpov, in an arrival statement Saturday, said his side ``isprepared to discuss'' the Krasnoyarsk radar. He said his delegationis ``ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent adherence tothe ABM treaty.''   Moscow will insist on ``the preservation of the ABM treatyintact as it was signed in 1972,'' he said, apparently alluding toMoscow's position that the Strategic Defense Initiative threatensthe treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
