It didn't give per-share figures.    Revenue increased 9.5% to $9.44 billion from $8.62 billion a year earlier.    ABB said orders received increased 20.5% to $11.18 billion, compared with $9.28 billion in the first half of 1988.    ABB said considerable contributions to earnings came from power plants, power transmissions, industry and financial services business segments. Particularly good profits came from the superchargers and robotics business areas and from some installation material companies.    Separately, ABB said its 40%-owned Brel Ltd. received an order for #350 million ($555 million) -- the biggest in British railway history -- to deliver new trains to the London subway system. </TEXT></DOC>
