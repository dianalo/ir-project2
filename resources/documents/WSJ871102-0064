The New York-based cosmetics company said its offering of as much as 40% of its Japanese beauty division to Japanese investors will start in mid-December rather than mid-November.    Avon changed the date at the recommendation of Nomura Securities International, which heads the underwriting group. The move should allow the offering to be issued &quot;in a more stable market environment,&quot; the company said.    Avon said it will use the proceeds from the stock offering to reduce debt. </TEXT></DOC>
