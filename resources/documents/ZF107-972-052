Ponder, FedEx's senior vice presidentof IS and telecom.andM;Ponder maintains a five-year worldwide IS plan, which is updated every sixmonths.andP;  This basic blueprint, which covers the rollout of hardware, softwareand communications, details applications in financial and corporate systems,air and ground transport operations, and customer service.andP;  The five-yearplan includes the completion of a worldwide standardized communicationsnetwork.andM;Standardization is also being stressed on the systems side.andP;  &quot;we are doingour best to standardize on regional computing,&quot; Ponder says.andP;  &quot;The IBM AS/400is the current computer of choice, but it may not always be.&quot;andP;  For regionalcomputing, there is usually one system in each of the 119 countries FedExserves.andM;The applications used at different levels of FedEx's operations arestandardized as much as possible and then integrated across different systemsand countries.andP;  &quot;If we develop core applications,&quot; Ponder explains, &quot;then wecan take them to different parts of the world and customize the edges, and wegain at lot of productivity.&quot;andM;Productivity and profits were on FedEx's mind when it set up an EDI schemevia PCs at large-customer sites.andP;  The 8,000 IBM-compatible machines processorders and calculate sizes, weights and delivery schedules, streamliningservices for the customer.andP;  The company, which is planning more EDI efforts,is working closely with standards organizations to further these efforts.andM;Overall, standards are more important to FedEx than specific technologies.andO;&quot;The evolving  standards will help us more than any specific technology,&quot;confirms Ponder.andP;  Nevertheless, the firm has pinpointed and poured money intocertain technologies.andM;&quot;Continued increases in price/performance in RISC [reduced instruction setcomputing]-based technology, coupled with our ability to develop morecommercial systems with UNIX, will help us export many more systems to moreenvironments,&quot; says Ponder, who cites the advantages of distributedrelational database technology.andP;  &quot;This gives our remote users the ability toserve their own information needs, while at the same time we can standardizeour needs for the information flow.&quot;andM;TRAFALGAR HOUSE PLCandM;Headquarters: London Employees: 28,000 1988 Revenue: 2.7 pound sterling ($4.3billion) 1989 IS Budget: $40 million to $50 millionandM;While the QE2 and London's Ritz Hotel are the jewels in this conglomerate'scrown, the Trafalgar House setting is actually a rich alloy of companies thatdevelop commercial and residential properties.andP;  Trafalgar's blend ofbusinesses combined with its expansion into foreign markets has createddifficult challenges for the company's IS professionals.andM;Those challenges are epitomized by its global IS strategy, which balances thetactics of decentralization with centralized control.andP;  &quot;The company believesin diversity and decentralization,&quot; says John Blagden, IT planning directorfor Trafalgar House Information Systems.andP;  &quot;But divisional IT directors can'tgo tramping off to do anything they wish.&quot;andM;The Trafalgar division that pulls the most weight and revenue is theconstruction and engineering division, which was responsible for more thanhalf of the conglomerate's turnover in 1988.andP;  Vertical integration of itsconstruction companies allows Trafalgar House to build residential propertyvirtually from mortar to mansion and to develop industrial facilities fromCAD drawings to completion.andP;  Because Trafalgar House is involved in everystage, it can keep track of projects better than its competitors, in largepart thanks to information systems.andM;One technology concept helping Trafalgar keep competitive is EDI.andP;  Thecompany originally used EDI to streamline its maritime operation, CunardEllerman Cargo.andP;  &quot;We were among the first companies to use the technology incargo shipping,&quot; says Blagden.andP;  And, indeed, the Data Interchange in Shipping(DISH) rules for maritime documents that were developed by Trafalgar are thestandard of the industry.andM;&quot;Because of our success in shipping, we will now endeavor to take EDI intoour property business,&quot; explains Bladgen.andP;  This process will be conducted bymoral suasion rather than by fiat from Trafalgar's IS experts.andP;  &quot;for the mostpart,&quot; he says, &quot;Trafalgar House Information Systems has an advisory status.andO;Our planning consultants serve two functions--they handle all IT issues andthey centralize information.&quot;andM;Blagden estimates that 1% of the conglomerate's revenue, or roughly $40million to $50 million, goes to IS.andP;  Since Trafalgar maintains a loosefederation of IS departments, &quot;we don't ever add up the IS budgets across thecompanies,&quot; Blagden notes.andM;Nor is there a grand strategy handed down by IS pros in corporate Olympus.andO;Systems people from the operating companies work together with group ISdirectors to set overall IT strategy for one-and two-year periods.andP;  Trafalgardivisions, however, can plan three to five years ahead, if they choose.andM;Blagden says the ultimate IS goal for Trafalgar is &quot;seamless, integrated,distributed, cooperative processing&quot; (SIDCP), which will emphasize suchtechnologies as EDI for the company's property operations.andP;  SIDCP, which willtake two years to develop, will be based on emerging UNIX and Open SystemInterconnection (OSI) standards.andP;  &quot;And if it is as successful as DISH,&quot; saysBlagden, &quot;its standards may eventually be accepted by vendors throughout theconstruction industry.&quot;andM;MARRIOTT CORP.andM;Headquarters: Washington, D.C.andP;  Employees: 230,000 1988 Revenue: $7.3 billion1989 IS Budget: UndisclosedandM;Standardization and support are the cornerstones of Marriott Corp.'s globalIS strategy.andP;  &quot;We don't put equipment in the field that requires technicianson site or equipment that can't be supported locally by the vendor,&quot; sums upJames Yoakum, Marriott's senior vice president of IS.andP;  Yoakum oversees thediversified company's global IS policy, which is updated annually andadjusted every two years, when specific applications planning is done.andM;Marriott's global systems stratey percolates down through the ranks from acentral coordinating source that matches IS resources with needs of thecompany's hotel, restaurant and contract services operations.andP;  On the hotelside, Marriott's standard solution is IBM, except in areas of the world likeWarsaw, Poland, where the company opted for NCR Corp. point of sale systembecause Big Blue could not be supported locally.andM;Yoakum has also standardized on IBM for Marriotths contract servicesbusiness, which includes its various food service management operations andits facilities management business.andP;  Contract services is currently pushinginto Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, areas where equipment support is amajor hassle.andP;  That certainly isn't an issue for the firm in the restaurantarena.andP;  Marriott's domestic restaurants, typified by its Roy Rogers andHoward Hohnson chains, usually do their own processing via on-site PCs.andM;Handling the diverse communications needs of this far-flung company is nosimple task.andP;  In the United States, the corporation uses a privateleased-line network, whereas offshore it uses public X.25 packet-switchingnetworks.andP;  Outside the States, London is a primary communications center forthe firm, with leased lines routed into Paris and Frankfurt, and publicpacket networks servicing Vienna and Athens.andP;  Configuring this complexnetwork requires some creative planning.andP;  &quot;For example,&quot; says Yoakum, &quot;it'scheape to go from London through vienna to Poland than directly from Londonto Poland.&quot;andM;Marriott is currently overhauling its communications network in an attempt tomove away from hardware-specific software.andP;  The objective is to takeadvantage of newer hardware based on reduced instruction set computing(RISC).andP;  In addition, the company is extensively using EDI technologies.andP;  &quot;Wehave to buy food for many of our operations.andP;  We use our distributioncenters, or we buy from master distributors.andP;  In either case, a key part ofour decision-making process is [determining] who can meet out EDIrequirements,&quot; says Yoakum.andM;RHONE-POULENCandM;Headquarters: Paris Employees: 80,000 1989 Revenue: Fr65.3 ($10.96 billion)1989 IS Budget: FR 1 billion ($155 million)andM;The chemistry behind Rhone-Poulenc's global IS strategy is formulated by the61-year-old chemical company's centralized IS department.andP;  This unit operatesthe firm's worldwide telecommunications network and its IS facilities,including its two central mainframe sites in France, which run IBM 3090s.andO;Nevertheless, the individual subsidiaries of France's largest chemical andpharmaceutical company retain considerable freedom to cater to their localapplications needs.andM;Rhone-Poulenc's coordinating central IS arm doles out technical advice to thesubsidiaries and lays down broad guidelines for IS operations throughout thecompany.andP;  These guidelines spell out the working methods for such major ISactivities as systems development--methods that are incorporated into thecompany's overall Integrated Systems Strategy Plan.andM;In practice, the IS department coordinates companywide communications throughthe operation of its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) telecom network,which uses X.25 access links.andP;  It also runs a separate X.400 electronic mailnetwork.andP;  &quot;Standards are not specified as such,&quot; points out Francois Poujois,deputy manager of organization and systems at Rhone-Poulenc, &quot;but they areimplicit in the choice of hardware that must be connectable to the network.&quot;andO;The French chemical company's IS plan, which spans the years 1990 to 1995,&quot;provides for the extension of the telecommunications infrastructure and alsofor greater use of common applications,&quot; says Poujois.andP;  Today, Rhone-Poulencis implementing electronic mail and EDI technologies.andP;  In the future, Poujoissays, the firm will be &quot;hoping for great things [from] computer-assistedtranslation systems and expert systems for particular applications where weneed to diffuse know-how worldwide.&quot;andM;As for the broader realm of information technology, Poujois confirms that ITis a component in the company's overall business strategy.andP;  &quot;Management hasdecided to invest in IT and is banking on it,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Informationtechnology forms part of the internationalization of the group andaccompanies its evolution.&quot;andM;KLOCKNER andamp; CO. AGandM;Headquarters: Duisburg, West Germany Employees: 9,900 1988 Revenue: DM11.89billion ($6.8 billion) 1989 IS budget: DM24.9 million ($13.3 million)andM;For 83-year old Klockner, IS planning on both a global and general scale is amatter of time.andP;  Much time.andP;  The West German transportation firm formulatesits hardware strategies to cover a three- to five-year period.andP;  Its softwarestrategies are mapped out 10 years in advance, while its all-importantsystems architecture goes five years even further into the future.andM;All this planning and projection is crucial to a company that must meetprecise distribution deadlines.andP;  A major European transportation carrier,Klockner lives by the clock in its trucking and shipping operations.andP;  Helpingthe time-conscious company beat the clock is EDI, which plays a pivotal partin Klockner's business and banking relationships.andM;For more than 10 years, Klockner has been involved in an EDI effort withVolkswagen.andP;  It's currently working on implementing EDI electronic bankingarrangements with the Deutsche Bank and its customers in the mineral oilindustry.andP;  Such schemes, points out Georg Thaler, Klockner's chiefinformation manager, can be difficult to get rolling because &quot;some customersstill like to pay by check, and some banks still like to depart from the[SWIFT] standard whenever they can find a loophole.&quot;andM;Thaler says that IS standards make sense because they save the company money.andO;&quot;We welcome every standard that can assure us success at lower costs,&quot; hesays.andP;  In fact, IS standards have enabled technology to be deployedthroughout Klockner's global operations over the last decade.andP;  A primeexample is a distributed data-processing setup the company put in place forall European countries.andP;  The network involved central planning, applicationsdevelopment and support.andM;Klockner's worldwide operations are encouraged to follow global IS auditingstandards pertaining to such things as reliability and security.andP;  They arealso encouraged to think about ways to use new technology.andP;  Thaler himself isconvinced that expert systems and automatic machine translation technologieswill help the firm enhance its international operations in the future.andM;GRAND METROPOLITAN PLCandM;Headquarters: London Employees: 190,000 1989 Revenue: 9.9 billion poundsterling ($15.8 billion) 1989 IS Budget: 100 million pound sterling ($158million)andM;At Grand Metropolitan, where an appetite for acquisition culminated last yearin the purchase of the Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., a steady diet ofIS-based controls is a necessity.andP;  &quot;No formal IS strategy is imposed from thetop down,&quot; explains Dennis Williams, group systems planning director at the$16 billion conglomerate.andP;  &quot;Systems directors at the operating companiesdevelop one- and four-year plans.andP;  Then they work with group technical,systems and telecom directors to set overall policy.andP;  But, we don't mandatepolicy where it is not needed,&quot; he stresses.andM;In practice, policy is needed more often than not to keep the acquisitiveconglomerate on the right technology track--particularly since its goal is tobe the world's top retailer and premier purveyor of food and beverages.andP;  Inpursuing those goals, Grand Metrolitan's grand design is to strike ageographical balance among European, Far Eastern and North American markets.andM;To achieve that end, Grand Met has turned to technology.andP;  The British gianthas established data centers that operate as computer utilities in each ofits geographic regions.andP;  There are now two data centers in Britain and fivein the United States.andP;  And, there is a new emphasis.andP;  &quot;A few years ago,&quot;Williams recalls, &quot;too much time was spent on data centers and not enoughtime was spent on applications.&quot;andM;Grand Met has also begun a drive for IS standards that each of its operatingcompanies can endorse.andP;  &quot;Not enough companies push for commonality,&quot; saysWilliams.andP;  &quot;We'd love to have more, too.andP;  And we soon will.andM;&quot;The new IBM Repository,&quot; Williams continues, &quot;will help provide moreopportunities to standardize.andP;  So, too, will SQL-oriented DBMSs [StructuredQuery Language-oriented database management systems].andP;  Beyond that, we arevery interested in SAA [Systems Application Architecture] as a model.andP;  but itis still too soon to say whether IBM's SAA offerings will be the bestavailable.&quot;andM;Reporting for this article was provided by Leila Davis, James Etheridge,Peggy Trautman and Hesh Wiener.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
