But they do not preclude extremelyvaluable partial agreements. In the course of time, the author says partialagreements could include: some reductions and limitations of manpowerand armaments, both conventional and nuclear; constraints on deploymentof manpower and armaments in certain areas; mutual inspection for verificationand assurance against surprise attack; exchange of information; limitationson the size of out-of-garrison activity, prenotification of out-of-garrisonactivities, and presence of observers at them. Cumulative measures likethese could make an important contribution to the stabilization of theEast-West confrontation in Europe and would represent major gains insecurity for both sides. That East-West confrontation in Europe willcontinue and that the prospects for far-reaching arms control programsare slim are facts that make it even more worthwhile to seek agreementon such partial measures. Even for a limited, partial program of thiskind, it will be necessary for Western governments to carefully thinkthrough the relationship between CDE and MBFR and to expand the coverageof present negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
