The OAS, with U.S. backing, slapped an embargo on Haitilast fall after the nation's military ousted the firstdemocratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Ifthe OAS can force Haiti's military to restore democracy, itwould send an important message to other would-be dictatorsin the region. But if it fails to work its will on animpoverished, strategically unimportant nation such as Haiti,the OAS would send the opposite signal.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, after long negotiations, Mr. Aristide agreed toaccept as his prime minister one of his harshest critics.That move could prove to be a first step toward Mr.Aristide's return. But a bitter ratification fight in Haiti'sparliament is likely, and it isn't certain the military willaccept the deal.   &quot;All the generals in Latin America are watching thisprocess,&quot; says Jean Casimir, who was appointed by Mr.Aristide to be Haiti's ambassador to the U.S. &quot;It is overthree months {since the military takeover}, and those whoplotted the coup are still in power.&quot;   President Bush has a stake in the restoration of Haiti'slegitimate government. If a prolonged economic embargodestroys Haiti's fragile economy, refugees could flood intoFlorida, creating new tensions and economic burdens in thatstate, which holds a presidential primary in March.   Some Haitians say the administration hasn't appliedpressure on Haiti in the most effective way. Last fall, theadministration said it would consider freezing any U.S.assets of military officers who participated in the coup, andof their wealthy Haitian backers. Mr. Casimir also said theadministration was considering temporarily lifting U.S. visasfor these people, who travel frequently to the U.S. to shopor visit relatives.   But neither step was taken. A State Department officialsaid, &quot;The purpose of the embargo was to bring the parties tothe table to get negotiations going to resolve this crisis.&quot;With this process now under way, he said, &quot;we aren't going totake steps to add to the embargo at this point.&quot;   Rep. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.), chairman of the HouseForeign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs,believes that only the threat of military action by othernations in the region would persuade those who seized powerin Haiti to restore democracy.   &quot;There was an opportunity here for the big countries inLatin America to show that they are ready to collectivelyparticipate in the restoration of a democratic government andthe defeat of a military coup,&quot; Rep. Torricelli says. &quot;Thatwould have put every potential despot in the region onnotice.&quot; Now, he says, &quot;it is a lost opportunity.&quot;   Mr. Torricelli and others concede that one difficulty ingetting support for stronger action against Haiti has beenMr. Aristide's record. He was overwhelmingly elected inHaiti's first free election and is immensely popular with thepoor. But his fiery rhetoric sometimes incited classviolence. &quot;The democratic process doesn't always produceperfect results,&quot; says Mr. Torricelli.   With little inclination toward military action, OASmembers formed a consensus on the economic embargo. But ithas been a blunt instrument, punishing mostly the urban poorand having minimal impact on the privileged. Now, says acongressional aide, there's concern that the embargo may bewrecking Haiti's feeble economy beyong repair.   U.S. officials believed that a key to the embargo would beblocking shipments of oil to Haiti. Privately, they estimatedlast year that Haiti would run out of fuel by December,bringing the military and its supporters to their knees. Butat least two oil tankers -- one from Europe, which isn'tparticipating in the embargo, and one from Colombia, whichsays it thought the cargo was headed for the Bahamas -- haveslipped through the embargo.   In Haiti, the intimidation of Mr. Aristide's supporterscontinues. Last month, a pirate radio station calling itselfRadio VSN-57, a name once used by the dreaded TontonsMacoutes secret police during the Duvalier dictatorship,called for violence against more than 100 Aristidesupporters, according to a report by several organizations,including Americas Watch, a private human-rights group.   &quot;If democracy can be restored in Haiti, it would provide acouple of grains of sand on the side of the balance againstmilitary coups,&quot; says Peter Hakim, staff director of theInter-American Dialogue, a private group.</TEXT></DOC>
