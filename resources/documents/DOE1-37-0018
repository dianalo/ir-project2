In order to make an ITV camera equipment in accord with the intrinsicalsafety standard, a change of the circuit design was made and an adjustingdevice was provided in order to control opening and focusing remotely.With regard to the lighting equipment, since a temperature rise of filamentspresents troubles from the standpoint of the safety and explosion preventionstandard, it is desirable to introduce the light from the outside orto obtain non-bulb light sources such as light emitting diode or electroluminescense,etc. From among them, optical fibers were examined, but it was revealedthat they are not suitable for long distance transmission and cost much.From the viewpoint of the gateway maintenance and management, the problemat the time of severance of fiber wires has not been solved as yet. Themining monitor control equipment has the intrinsically safe structureand can also be watched in the hydroextractor room. (2 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
