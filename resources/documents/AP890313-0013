Mexican officials estimate that at any given moment at least10,000 Cental Americans are in Mexico, many of them heading towardBrownsville, Texas, the closest point in the United States toCentral America.   Oscar Mauricio Torres Sosa, legal adviser to El Salvador'sMigration Department, said at least 550,000 to 600,000 people _ over10 percent of the population _ have left the country during its9-year-old civil war, the vast majority for the United States.   ``All types of people are leaving, from all social levels,''Torres said.   As many as 100,000 Central Americans may enter, or try to enter,the United States this year, U.S. immigration officials say.   Many of the refugees say they are persecuted in their homelandsby death squads, the army or guerrilla groups. Many take busesthrough other Central American nations and arrive in Tapachula, inthe southernmost state of Chiapas.   On the 1,100-mile trail north to Matamoros, the refugeesencounter extortion from officials and bus drivers, then findthemselves cheated or stripped by smugglers who offer to take thempast newly reinforced U.S. border patrols in theMatamoros-Brownsville region.   Cirse Amador, 22, a Nicaraguan, said her group of six paid a busdriver $65 to get past checkpoints in Mexico. After they got toMatamoros, she said, ``they took us all off the bus. They asked for$50 apiece and since we didn't have dollars they took 50,000pesos,'' or $21, she said.   Once inside the United States, the refugees face arrest by theU.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is jailing anddeporting those who can't prove political persecution.   Nevertheless, thousands are determined to get through.   ``One day I'll get there. I don't know when, but I'll do it,''said 28-year-old Eduardo Lopez Lozano, a mechanic and repairman fromrelatively peaceful Tegucigalpa, Honduras.   ``Life has been hard for me and has taught me to do everything... and this will help me in the United States,'' Lopez told TheAssociated Press.   Mexican officials in Tapachula complain that Central Americanstake jobs from Mexicans, don't pay taxes on their businesses andcommit crimes.   They would not, however, discuss the problem in detail and spokeonly on condition of anonymity.   ``Our worry is the same as in the United States: What do we dowith them? Here we have an economic recession,'' declared oneofficial. Mexico is already struggling to provide jobs for onemillion new workers annually.   For most Central Americans, there is no way to legally migrate tothe United States unless they fall into a preference group, eitherby family relations or special skills or by luck via an annuallottery.   For many, requesting political asylum had been the only legal wayin, but at the U.S. border, a suddenly toughened U.S. policy haschanged the pattern.   Many are waiting at the border for another chance. Others areseeking to cross illegally with ``coyotes,'' or people-smugglers, asmany Mexicans do. Still others are looking for softer points alongthe 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.   ``We're seeing the same number of people trying to cross,'' saidInez Gonzalez, information director for the Matamoros citygovernment. ``The problem here in Matamoros is that they don't havea place to go. They don't have a place to eat.'' In Matamoros thereis only one shelter for Central Americans.   Across the Rio Grande, the Central Americans fill detentioncenters in Brownsville, where they outnumber Mexicans trying toenter south Texas by as much as 9-to-1 on some days, U.S. BorderPatrol agents say.   Last week, as deportations began, there were some 1,700 illegalCentral Americans detained in Brownsville, many in shelters andtents.   Torres, the Salvadoran legal adviser, said most Salvadoranemigrants are seeking better economic conditions.   Typically, workers in the United States send dollars back torelatives, dollars that help support the local economy. TheGuatemalan magazine Cronica said such funds total about $430 milliona year and constitute Guatemala's largest single source of foreignexchange.   In El Salvador estimates of the funds run from $200 million to$600 million, which would be larger than the annual figure for U.Said. The money is hard to track because much of it is either mailedor brought in as cash.   In Nicaragua, where inflation reached 20,000 percent last yearand living standards are plunging, the leftist government hasencouraged emigration to rid itself of political opponents anddissatisfied citizens.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua summed up his attitude bysaying that opponents can ``find their democracy in Miami.''</TEXT></DOC>
