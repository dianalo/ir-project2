Thisrecording not only reproduces Fernandez's sound in crystal, it alsocaptures to a distracting degree the clicking, zinging sounds ofthe mechanics of playing his instrument.   Aside from the the suites, this two-disc set offerstranscriptions of assorted Bach works for violin and harpsichord,confined to a second disc timed at a pitiful 44.59.   Fernandez is also a little ungenerous musically. His techicallyfine playing sounds not especially sensitive, on this recording atleast. Lines are not well shaped and don't always emergeindependently, and the phrasing sometimes sounds rushed.   _ By Daniel J. Wakin, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Deaf, Dumb, and Blonde'' (Sire) _ Deborah Harry      ``Deaf, Dumb and Blonde'' is Deborah Harry's third solo effortsince the breakup of the punk bastion Blondie.   Unfortunately, Harry has locked into today's pop format and thealbum lacks her snarling early 1980s cleverness.   Two of the tracks, including the lead single, ``I Want ThatMan,'' were written by Allanah Currie and Tom Bailey of theThompson Twins, and their influence permeates most of the record inthe form of snappy beats and almost mundane lyrics.   On the few songs Harry wrote with ex-boyfriend Chris Stein, thedark, brooding punk attitudes return. Harry's self-confident lyricsand Stein's menacing guitar combine on several notable tracks.   ``Lovelight,'' a duet with Ian Astbury of The Cult, mixesparadoxical imagery with Indian rhythms to tell of love in acryptic, mystical setting. ``Calmarie,'' which Harry sings partlyin Spanish, is a lovely showcase for the higher register of hervoice.   ``Brite Side'' produces a more tender side. She is confident,but not arrogant; loving, but not worshiping.   You have to wait for most of the record for a real knockout.That comes with the last track, the gorgeously arranged ``End ofthe Run.'' It is a partly spoken song-poem that tells of Harry'sbeginnings: ``when a torn T-shirt made it all dangerous.'' In it,she says she ``doesn't like flashbacks in movies ... I like thestory to proceed.''   Harry's story has proceeded, but into what's threatening to looklike pop dribble. She's called her new music ``simpler and moreaggressive.'' Simpler, yes. More agressive, no.   By Kira L. Billik, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
