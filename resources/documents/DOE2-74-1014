Fundamentalprinciples governing the physics of the interaction between the fastelectron and a thin foil sample, to account for the fine structure inthe inelastically scattered fast electron distribution (EELS), will bereviewed. General application of EELS is in the area of low atomic numberelements (Zandless;11) microanalysis, where it significantly complements themore widely used EDX spectroscopy. However, a careful analysis of thelow loss plasmon oscillations and the fine structure in the core-lossedges, can provide additional information related to the bonding andelectronic structure of the sample. An illustration of this is presentedfrom our study of C{delta}diamond residue from the Allende carbonaceouschondrite. Combination of EELS with channeling effects can provide specificsite occupation/valence information in crystalline materials. Detailsof this novel crystallographic method will be outlined and illustratedwith an example of the study of chromite spinels. 62 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
