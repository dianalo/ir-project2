A reviewof the current status of micro- and macroalgal genetic technology wasdone to identify possible genetic vectors and techniques for the geneticmanipulation of algae. The heritability of morphological, physiological,and biochemical traits in selected micro- and macroalgae was studied,and new techniques to study algal genetics were explored. In addition,efforts to use mutagens to produce, isolate, and identify mutants werecontinued. This project emphasizes measurements of floating drift algaeand studies of microalgae. Morphological and cytological features willbe evaluated from photographs and photomicrographs. Breeding trials andcharacterization studies will be carried out to distinguish genetic andenvironmental components that determine several morphological, physiological,and biochemical traits and processes. In addition to hybridization, whichhas already been accomplished with some gametophytic strains, the contractorwill evaluate ultraviolet and chemical mutagenesis.</TEXT></DOC>
