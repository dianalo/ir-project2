David Ball, assistant secretary of labor for the Pensionand Welfare Benefits Administration, said in an interviewthat the department hopes to have the proposal cleared by theWhite House budget office in time to introduce legislationnext month.</LP><TEXT>   In a speech here to a meeting of the American Institute ofCertified Public Accountants, Mr. Ball said his department isconsidering provisions covering audit enforcement andso-called multiple-employer welfare arrangements, or MEWAs.MEWAs are plans created to provide health benefits toemployees of more than one small employer. Many have beenmarked by underfunding, inability to pay claims, or evenschemes in which premiums are embezzled and participants leftwithout the coverage they had purchased.   These new legislative provisions would be stronger thanthose contained in a Bush administration plan sent toCongress last year, Mr. Ball said. For example, pension-planadministrators would be required to tell the Labor Departmentof certain criminal violations by persons or institutionsconnected with the plan. They would also have to report anytermination of a plan auditor before the audit work isfinished, which Mr. Ball said could show irregularities inthe plan's administration.   Also under consideration is reviving, from last year'sbill, proposals to repeal an exemption from full-scale fundaudits that the government has granted plan administrators.Under the exemption, administrators are allowed to excludefrom an audit assets held by regulated financialinstitutions, such as banks, savings and loans, and insurancecompanies.   As with last year's bill, the department is consideringallowing a plan's auditor to rely on a financialinstitution's audit of its assets, while adding a requirementthat independent public accountants who audit benefit plansget a peer review every three years, to be deemed&quot;qualified.&quot;   The new ideas for regulating MEWAs would replace lastyear's proposal to require certain MEWA plans to fileregistration statements. Mr. Ball said this proposal wascriticized as too weak to deter abuse.   Instead, the department is considering provisions thatmake it a federal violation for a MEWA to operate without astate license, resolve ambiguities about federal-lawpre-emption and thus remove barriers to effective stateregulation, and expand federal authority to grant MEWAs anexemption from state regulation if it's believed this wouldbenefit plan participants, he said.   Mr. Ball also said the department is only studying someother enforcement proposals that were contained in lastyear's bill. He said that pension-rights and employers groupsheld &quot;conflicting views&quot; on the merits of these ideas. Theseinclude giving expert witness and attorney fees to successfulplaintiffs in benefits lawsuits, awarding part of penaltiesto a person who told the department of the violation, anddoubling fines for illegal benefit-plan transactions.   The focus has shifted during the past 18 months fromencouraging private benefits lawsuits, Mr. Ball said in theinterview, to the audit-enforcement and MEWA issues, &quot;wherethere is some clarity.&quot; Meanwhile, Congress is consideringlegislation that would repeal a Supreme Court decision thatlets federal health-benefits law preempt state laws that seekto allow punitive damages for persons whose health claims areunfairly denied.   Mr. Ball also noted that the pension benefits agency isinvestigating any possible misuse of New York Daily Newspension funds, in the wake of the collapse of the RobertMaxwell media empire, which includes the Daily News. Agencyofficials said the investigation began prior to Mr. Maxwell'sdeath on Nov. 5, but declined to say why the probe began thatearly.</TEXT></DOC>
