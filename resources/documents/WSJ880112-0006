And it faces an even more limited future if the panel's proposals are adopted.    Portfolio insurance is a pension-fund strategy to sell stock or futures during a market decline to try to avert losses. It accounted for 20% of futures selling and more than 10% of stock sales in the Oct. 19 market plunge, according to the presidential task force known as the Brady commission. The panel said such insurers, along with a few mutual funds, engaged in &quot;mechanical, price-insensitive selling&quot; beyond the market's capacity to absorb.    &quot;We don't have any clients asking us about it now,&quot; said Lawrence Davanzo, a partner at Wilshire Associates, a Santa Monica, Calif., pension consultant. &quot;We have clients commenting that if anybody did ask them, they would unequivocally say no.&quot;    Fred Grauer, head of the investment unit of Wells Fargo andamp; Co., the portfolio insurer identified as the largest seller of stocks and futures on Black Monday, bitterly criticized the report. &quot;There were a lot more sellers besides us, and just because we happened to be in relatively greater volume doesn't make us the cause,&quot; he said.    Mr. Grauer added, &quot;The commission totally missed the point. Portfolio insurance has no capacity to keep the market down after it has finished selling. They've done a disservice to those who've been spotlighted because they did nothing wrong, but they're being cast as the villains of the piece.&quot;    Wells Fargo's total of stocks covered by insurance has already fallen to less than $3 billion from more than $9 billion, Mr. Grauer said. &quot;I would say this business is going to have some pretty heavy sledding. Aside from any issues of social acceptability, the cost is higher because the volatility of the market is higher, and the consequence is less will be done. But I don't think it's dead.&quot;    Even after the falloff in insured assets, Wells Fargo retains more than $50 billion under management, much of it in index funds that aim to match the market's performance.    Estimates of the amount of stock covered by portfolio insurance prior to the crash ranged from $60 billion to $90 billion -- a huge amount, but still less than 10% of all stocks owned by pension funds. One executive at a large insurer, who asked not to be named, estimated that if $80 billion was covered, the total has shrunk to $20 billion.    Moreover, because stocks have already fallen so far, many of the remaining accounts are heavily hedged by sales of stock index futures. That would limit the remaining accounts' selling of stocks or futures if the market fell further.    The Brady commission's proposal for changes in margin rules could make futures, which many portfolio insurers use as hedges, more expensive. Also significant are its proposals for &quot;circuit breakers,&quot; such as trading halts or position size limits, to keep markets from careening out of control. Such steps could hamstring portfolio insurance trading.    Indeed, the report says such trading halts would make it &quot;far more difficult for some market participants -- pension portfolio insurers, aggressive mutual funds -- to mislead themselves into believing that it is possible to sell huge amounts in short time periods.&quot;    &quot;Portfolio insurance has lost a lot of its allure in that it didn't really work when it was supposed to&quot; because of the market dislocations during the crash, said Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp.    Sandy Lincoln, a pension consultant at Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen in Deerfield, Ill., said two of his three clients who had portfolio insurance before the crash had dropped it because of a lack of confidence that it works as advertised. But he believes insurance was &quot;a contributor more than a cause&quot; of the crash.    Jeffrey Geller, who runs insurance programs at BEA Associates Inc., argued that insurance-related futures selling was &quot;predictable, and I don't understand how activity that is predictable can create havoc.&quot; He said blame should be shared by the aggressive traders who, the panel said, sold in anticipation of insurance selling.    One portfolio insurance executive acknowledged yesterday that the wave of bad publicity itself would make it very difficult to restore the industry to its former size.    Some in the business, which sprang up only in the past few years, grumbled privately about the panel's composition, with three members from more-traditional securities concerns. Panel chairman Nicholas Brady is chairman of the old-line investment banking firm of Dillon Read andamp; Co., and members Howard Stein and Robert Kirby are longtime heads of established money management concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
