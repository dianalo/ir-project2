The recommendation by Bundesbank President Karl-Otto Poehlat a meeting of European Community finance ministers andcentral bank governors in Galway, Ireland, marked a retreatfrom pledges made by West German leaders during recent EastGerman elections. Mr. Poehl said a 1-to-1 conversion rateshould be limited to a maximum 2,000 marks per East Germancitizen. The rest of East German savings, debt and wageswould be converted at the rate of two East marks for one WestGerman mark. A West German mark has a value of 59 U.S. centsat current exchange rates.</LP><TEXT>   Furious East Berlin officials warned that anything lessthan a broadly implemented 1-for-1 rate would impoverish mostEast German wage earners and even hinder the unification ofthe two Germanys. Leaders of the major East German partiesjoined together over the weekend to reject the plan, and EastGerman Premier Hans Modrow said in a newspaper interview theproposal has already stirred widespread unrest in the EastGerman population. He insisted that West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl and other Bonn officials had promised East Germansavers a 1-for-1 rate in the run-up to East Germany's March18 election, which resulted in a landside victory forBonn-supported conservatives.   &quot;The election result was the result of these promises, andnothing else,&quot; Mr. Modrow declared. The head of the caretakergovernment insisted that East Germans had interpreted thepromises as having a broad application, including wages.   Mr. Modrow warned that Bonn would be held responsible forany strikes or demonstrations that might result from theapparent policy shift. Officials for the East GermanChristian Democrats reported that their East Berlinheadquarters was flooded with calls from angry citizens.   Rainer Eppelmann, head of the Democratic Awakening party,one of the three East German parties making up the CDU-ledconservative alliance, predicted a fresh wave of emigrationto West Germany.   The proposal unsettled Mr. Kohl's allies back in Bonn.Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democratic Party, thejunior partner in the Bonn government coalition, told anewspaper the proposal could be seen as &quot;a breach of faith.&quot;   East Germans can now buy West German marks at a subsidizedrate of one for each three East marks. Monetary officialscalculate the East mark's true purchasing power suggests arate of 4.4 to one. Even a 2-to-1 rate would be a vastimprovement for East German workers, they say.   While the West German government hasn't accepted the2-for-1 proposal, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said it was&quot;economically and financially well founded&quot; and that itcouldn't be ignored, while Economics Minister HelmutHaussmann called the recommendation an &quot;important decision&quot;that wouldn't inflict economic harm on East Germans.   While unpopular among the populace, a 2-for-1 rate wouldbe a boon to highly indebted East German state companies,which wouldn't have to use as much hard currency to pay offdebts, and would make East German companies more competitivewith Western ones. Such a rate would also be lessinflationary.</TEXT></DOC>
