The MECS is a generalpurpose statistical survey conducted for nonregulatory purposes. The surveyis mandatory under Title 3, Subtitle B, of the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1986, Pub. L. 99-509. The MECS is being designed by EIA and willbe administered and compiled by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (Census).By having Census administer the survey, responses are kept strictly confidentialunder section 9 of Title 13, U.S. Code. Responses and other identifiabledata may be seen only by sworn Census employees.The 1985 MECS was conducted in two different parts during 1986. The first,sent out in July of 1986 and utilizing Form EIA-846F, collected basic annualconsumption data for combustible and noncombustible energy sources. Forcombustible energy sources, data items included purchases and expenditures,onsite production, fuel use, nonfuel use, and storage capacity. For noncombustibleenergy sources (e.g., electricity and stream), the data collected werepurchases and expenditures, net transfers, and for electricity only, differenttypes of onsite generation and sales to utilities. The second of the MECS,conducted in November 1986 and utilizing Form EIA-846S, collected dataon the short-term capability of manufacturers to have switched energy sourcesbased on their actual consumption in 1985.The sample design for the 1985 MECS was a probability sample of approximately12,000 manufacturing establishments representing a universe of an estimated220,000 establishments with five or more employees. The sample was subselectedfrom the sample for Census' 1985 Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM).It was stratified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) two-digitmajor groups from 20 to 39 and the ten four-digit industries known to bethe most consumptive of energy. The design for the 1988 MECS sample willbe basically the same except that all ASM manufacturing establishmentsthat generate electricity will be sampled with certainty and added to thesample.The proposed 1988 MECS is not substantially different from the 1985 surveyin its basic data requirements. Some changes were made, however, in orderto make the collection more efficient, improve reliability, and reducerespondent burden. To minimize complexity, three separate forms have beenprepared to meet the special needs of various groups of manufacturers.Both the consumption and the fuel-switching sections appear on each ofthe forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>To obtain additional information or copies of the proposedforms, contact Mr. John L.

Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">II. Current Actions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">III. Written Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>Comments on the 1985 MECS were solicited in a March 21, 1985, <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice (50 FR 11486). That version of the MECSwas modified on the basis of those comments and the results of a pilottest. The proposed 1988 MECS design utilizes experience gained from theadministration and processing of the 1985 MECS, and consultations withrespondents, trade association representatives, and data users.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Current Actions</ITAG>EIA proposes to make the changes described below to the 1985 MECS surveyforms for use in 1988. These changes are being made to better serve theneeds of data users, streamline the administration and processing of thesurvey, and reduce respondent burden where possible.For the 1988 MECS, the fuel-switching and consumption sections will beconsolidated on each of three forms. That change will facilitate collectionand processing of the data and will reduce respondent burden as record-gatheringand respondent analysis will only be necessary once during the MECS cycle.Thus each survey form will contain three sections: Section I, Non-CombustibleEnergy Sources; Section II, Combustible Energy Sources; and Section III,Fuel Switching Capability.Separate forms have been designed to meet the special needs of three groupsof manufacturers. EIA-846A will be sent to the majority of the manufacturingestablishments; EIA-846B will be sent to establishments in SIC 2911 (PetroleumRefining); and EIA-846C will be sent to all other establishments in SIC29 (Petroleum Refining and Related Industries), as well as establishmentsin SIC 28 (Chemicals and Allied Products) and SIC 3312 (Blast Furnacesand Steel Mills). EIA-846A is the most general form and collects the basicconsumption and fuel-switching data. EIA-846B minimizes burden for therefining industry by taking advantage of data already collected by otherEIA surveys. Finally, EIA-846C is very similar to EIA-846A except thatit contains an additional question on energy source shipments.Specific changes in data items from the 1985 MECS are discussed sectionby section below.Section I (Noncombustible energy sources): This section will not differamong the three forms. There will be a minor change in format from the1985 version of the MECS. For clarity of presentation, questions will beasked in the form of a table, with the noncombustible energy sources (electricity,steam, other) as the column headings and the desired quantities formingthe rows. Of greater importance is the addition of four new questions relatingto the cogeneration of electricity. Because of a number of data user requestsconcerning cogeneration, the following questions now must be answered ifthe respondent had a non-zero entry for the amount of cogenerated electricityat the establishment:1. Enter the total nameplate capacity of all cogeneration units that werein place at this establishment on December 31, 1988.2. What is the maximum additional quantity of electricity that you couldhave cogenerated during 1988 over and above that which you actually producedat your establishment?3. Enter the quantity of each energy source that was consumed for the purposeof cogeneration in 1988. (Space is provided for possible energy sources.)4. Was this establishment designated as a Qualifying Facility under thePublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 as of December 31, 1988?(Yes/No)In order to increase the reliability of the electricity cogeneration estimates,the MECS sample will be supplemented by those establishments known to begenerators of electricity, from data submitted on the previous year's ASM.Section II (Combustible energy sources): Form EIA-846C will be sent torespondents in SIC 28, 3312, and 29 (but not in 2911) and will containan additional question on the Btu content of all energy source productshipments. The industries in those SIC's produce energy sources from otherenergy source inputs. Processing of those inputs would normally be countedas nonfuel use and thus contribute to total consumption at the establishment.Any resulting energy sources that are shipped and consumed elsewhere wouldduplicate the Btu of the energy source inputs. By subtracting the energysource shipments from total consumption, EIA can obtain a more accuratemeasure for actual consumption at the establishment.Form EIA-846B will require petroleum refiners (SIC 2911) to be cognizantof the division between the refinery part of the establishment and thenonrefinery (i.e., petrochemical) part and how that division is reflectedin reporting on the ASM. The MECS will take advantage of data reportedon other EIA forms covering refinery operations in order to minimize respondentburden.Section III (Fuel Switching): This section is very similar to the 1985EIA-846S survey, ``Part II_Fuel Switching.'' One change is that liquidpetroleum gases (LPG) will also be included as a fuel for which to reportsubstitution. The other change involves the reporting of the lead timeto switch fuels. The time to make each potential switch will be obtainedrather than just the time for switching to the primary replacement fuel.That change represents a very small increase in reporting burden but willgreatly enhance the data analysis, because ambiguity in relating lead timesto alternate energy sources will be eliminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Written Comments</ITAG>The following general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparationof comments. When providing comments, please indicate the form to whichthe comment applies (EIA-846A, B, or C).<ITAG tagnum="15">As a potential data user:</ITAG>A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the forms (orat higher levels of aggregation, if necessary)?B. For what purpose would you use these data? Please be specific.C. How could the forms be improved to better meet your specific data needs?D. Are there alternative sources for these data? What are they? Do youuse them? What are their deficiencies?<ITAG tagnum="15">As a potential respondent:</ITAG>A. Are the instructions clear and sufficient?B. How can the forms be improved?C. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions?D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average8 hours per response for each of the three forms. How much time, includingtime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information, do you estimate it will require you to complete and submitthe required form?E. Do you know of other Federal, State, or local agencies that collectsimilar data? If so, specify the agency and the means of collection.In addition to receiving comments to the general questions listed above,the EIA would like to receive comments specifically related to the changesmentioned previously in the data collection.1. If by your SIC code you would be required to complete EIA-846C, howdifficult would it be to answer the question on the Btu value of energysource shipments? How much time would it take you to answer?2. If you would be required to complete EIA-846B, can you easily make thedivision between the refinery portion and the petrochemical portion ofyour establishment? Are you aware of the establishment boundaries usedfor your response on the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufacturers?3. On all three forms, are the new questions on cogeneration easily understoodand answerable?The EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regardingtheir views on the need for the collection of the information containedin this survey.Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/orincluded in the request for OMB approval of this survey and will becomea matter of public record.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Statutory Authority: </T4>Sections 5(a), 5(b), 13(b), and 52 of Pub.L. 93-275, Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, as amended (15 U.S.C.S764(a), 764(b), 772(b), and 790(a)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on July 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Yvonne M.
