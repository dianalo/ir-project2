Direct injection diesel engines,which are widely used in agriculture, experience a variety of foulingproblems when operated on unmodified vegetable oils. These problems suchas sticking rings, fouled injectors, and varnish build-up on cylinderwalls, appear to be partially related to poor injector performance causedby the relatively high viscosity of vegetable oils. The formation oflower alcohol esters is an effective chemical means to reduce viscosity.Current research has focused on the production and use of sunflower oilmethyl ester. Physical and chemical properties of this fuel at severaldegrees of refinement were used to determine fuel properties. Enginetesting indicated that fuel grade sunflower oil methyl ester, definedas sunflower oil converted to methyl ester of at least 90% purity, hadabout the same tendency to foul a direct injection diesel engine as number2 diesel fuel. A pilot plant for the production of fuel grade vegetableoil methyl ester has been designed and constructed. This plant produces500 gallon batches of fuel grade sunflower oil methyl ester. At the timeof the writing of the report, over 3000 gallons of fuel grade sunfloweroil methyl ester have been produced in this pilot plant.</TEXT></DOC>
