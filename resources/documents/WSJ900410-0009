He complains that one ofthe fund's biggest holdings is Waste Management Inc., acompany with a long list of Environmental Protection Agencyviolations.   The reply from the Freedom Environmental Fund's portfoliomanager, David Beckwith, is equally intense. &quot;There are nopristine companies,&quot; he says, insisting Waste Management ispart of the solution instead of the problem. &quot;They run thecleanest landfill dumps in the business and have received alot of violations because they're easy to target,&quot; he says.   As for Waste Management itself, it figures that &quot;the scaleof our organization increases our chances to be in technicalnoncompliance&quot; with environmental laws, as William Plunkett,a vice president for corporate communications, puts it. &quot;Weare deeply committed to be in total compliance,&quot; he says --adding that neither Progressive Asset nor Mr. Camejo &quot;hasever called on management or visited our facilities, althoughthey have a standing invitation to do so.&quot; He says analystsand environmentalists &quot;who've taken the time to get to knowus realize that our interests and interests of environmentalgroups coincide.&quot;   So it goes in the brave new world of &quot;the Wall Streetgreens,&quot; a fast-growing collection of brokers and investmentmanagers at the center of a booming investment field. Eversince the Exxon Valdez hit a reef a year ago and oil-soakedsea otters started washing up on the Alaska coast, manyinvestors have been seeking ways to make money and help savethe environment, all at the same time.   Sometimes, however, environmental-fund operators seem tospend much of their time arguing about who is greener thanwhom -- and getting bogged down in abstruse scientificdebates.   Some investment professionals suspect that such portfoliomanagers' motives are a bit polluted themselves -- byeagerness to make a buck. Environmental investing &quot;is justthe latest marketing gimmick in a business with too muchcompetition,&quot; says Michael Stolper, a San Diego consultantwho selects money managers for wealthy clients. &quot;It furthercomplicates the already-complicated process of pickinginvestments.&quot;   The boom in environmental mutual funds is &quot;a case wheremarketing hoopla overrides investment good sense,&quot; adds KurtBrouwer, a partner in Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a San Franciscoinvestment-management firm. Mutual-fund marketers &quot;are tryingto jam these funds down people's throats because theenvironment is a hot item,&quot; he says. Instead of investing inthese funds, people who want to help the environment shoulddonate 10% of their investment profits to organizations thatare cleaning up their local areas, he says.   Many of the greens are former Vietnam-war protesters andother 1960s people who have turned in their blue jeans andtie-dyed T-shirts for button-down collars and jobs in theinvestment business. They still believe passionately in theircauses, but now their arena is the investment businessinstead of a university sit-in.   Freedom Environmental, which was offered to the public forthe first time last fall, is one of four mutual funds ridingthe environmental wave. Fidelity Investments' SelectEnvironmental Services Fund, which has raised $89 millionsince it started last June, is the largest. At least threemore funds are opening soon.   Other environmental investment vehicles include MerrillLynch Environmental Technology Trust, a unit trust ofpollution-cleanup stocks. It reached its $50 million goal ina few days last fall, and $123 million flooded in before thetrust could be closed. A second trust -- which, like thefirst, buys a portfolio of stocks but then doesn't trade them-- has been opened and already has assets of $6.7 million.   &quot;We are giving the investor a direct play on the fastestgrowth industry of the 1990s,&quot; says Larry Greenberg, managerof Fidelity Environmental Services Fund.   The surge of interest in environmental investing isn'tconfined to individuals. More and more foundations, publicand private pension funds, universities, labor unions,churches, insurers and banks are questioning their portfoliomanagers about companies' environmental records. &quot;Theenvironment is the social issue for institutional investorsnow,&quot; says Suzanne Harvey, director of Prudential-BacheCapital Funding Group's social-research service.   Legislation requiring state pension-fund managers to &quot;givepreference&quot; to companies that comply with a corporateenvironmental code known as the Valdez Principles has beenintroduced in New York and New Jersey. A bill is expectedsoon in the California legislature, and several other statesare studying this approach.   Track records on environmental investing are scarcebecause most of the funds are so new. But New AlternativesFund, which has been investing in alternative-energycompanies for five years, has a &quot;pretty fair record,&quot; says A.Michael Lipper, the president of Lipper Analytical Services,which tracks mutual funds. In the 12 months through March 12,New Alternatives achieved a total return of 12.9%, comparedwith 12% for the average stock fund. In the past five years,the fund has racked up a cumulative total return of 129.8%,compared with 110.1% for the average equity fund.   &quot;In general, screening out environmental pollutersshouldn't affect your return,&quot; says William Constantine,managing director of Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark, a New Yorkinvestment firm. &quot;There are plenty of stocks to accomplishyour investment results.&quot; In fact, avoiding companiesvulnerable to environmental lawsuits might be a way ofavoiding investments vulnerable to major, unpredictablecosts.   The greatest interest from individual investors is inCalifornia, the Pacific Northwest and New England. Brokersand financial planners there who specialize inenvironmentally conscious investments are thriving while muchof the retail brokerage business is in the doldrums.   Carsten Hennigsen, the president of Progressive SecuritiesInc., a Portland, Ore., brokerage firm specializing inenvironmental investing, has opened two new offices in theregion. Gross revenue is up 160% from a year ago, he says.First Affirmative Financial Network, of Colorado Springs,Colo., says January was the &quot;best month ever&quot; because ofinvestor interest in the environment.   Many &quot;green&quot; brokers are environmental activists who dothings that would turn a traditional broker's hair gray. Forexample, David Hills, 35, a broker at A.G. Edwards Inc. inPortsmouth, N.H., says he has been arrested four times fordemonstrating against the Seabrook nuclear-power plant in NewHampshire. &quot;I believe in environmental activism on theweekend as well as shareholder activism,&quot; Mr. Hills says. &quot;Imay climb over the fence at a nuclear plant, but I'm wearinga tie and coat when I do it.&quot;   Mr. Henningsen says he tries to talk customers out ofbuying a stock if he thinks it doesn't measure up onenvironmental grounds. If clients want to debate the issue,he refers them to a staff member with a doctorate in businessethics.   Some environmentalist financial planners don't even gointo the office. Helene Robertson, 45, a Financial NetworkInc. planner, operates out of her Seattle home. In a roomfilled with Northwest Indian art, she and three associatesscreen investments for her 600 clients. You won't find anyStyrofoam cups or plastic spoons there. &quot;We try to live it asmuch as we can,&quot; she says.   Typical clients of the Wall Street greens tend to beprofessionals such as educators, therapists, nurses,engineers, designers, attorneys, social workers, computerprogrammers and doctors. Many are 35- to 45-year-old babyboomers who may not have high-paying jobs but have inheritedportfolios of stocks that, for environmental reasons, theydislike.   &quot;I am a child of the '60s, and I received an inheritancewhich included stocks of agribusiness companies that madechemical fertilizers and hormones for cows,&quot; says SusieDexter, a 40-year-old Seattle educator. She went to Ms.Robertson for advice on how to clean her portfolio.   Some investors don't even want to have their money-marketfunds invest in the commercial paper -- the IOUs -- ofcompanies that allegedly pollute the environment. Lea Kouba,45, a psychiatric social worker in Freeland, Wash., says shehas switched to Working Assets, a San Francisco money-marketfund that screens out commercial paper from such companies.   &quot;My amount won't change the world, but I feel I can bepart of a shift of consciousness toward the environment,&quot; shesays. &quot;In the 1960s, we rebelled against the system. Now,we've mellowed and are trying to work for change fromwithin.&quot;   Environmental screening is complicated. Ms. Robertsoneliminates funds that invest in companies that own any of the150 most toxic plants in the U.S. as defined by the NationalWildlife Federation. She says she ends up with a data base of15 funds that are &quot;clean&quot; either &quot;by design or by default.&quot;Clean by default are small-stock funds such as Putnam OTCFund, Royce Value Fund and Review Management OTC Fund, shesays. Companies in these funds are in nonpollutingindustries. Clean by design funds include Calvert ArielAppreciation Fund and New Alternatives Fund.   While many individual investors like to purge theirportfolios of companies with many environmental violations,institutional investors want to look at the issue in moredepth, says Stephen Moody, senior portfolio manager of U.S.Trust Co. in Boston. Sometimes they want to hold stock in acompany that is both part of the problem and the solution, hesays.   Du Pont Co., for example, is the largest manufacturer ofchlorofluorocarbons, a gas used in auto air conditioners,refrigerators, aerosol sprays and cleaning agents. CFCs havebeen blamed for the Antarctic hole in the ozone layer thatprotects the Earth from ultraviolet rays. That does it forsome individual investors.   But Mr. Moody says some institutional clients continue tohold Du Pont because they deem it the company most likely tosolve the problem. Du Pont has said it will suspend all CFCproduction by the year 2000 or sooner, if possible. It isdeveloping substitutes for CFCs.   Environmental investment people say environmentalists lineup on both sides of many such issues. &quot;The decision comesdown to balancing trade-offs -- long-term and short-termcosts,&quot; says Mr. Henningsen, the Portland broker. &quot;But we'vegot to look at the environmental bottom line as well as thefinancial bottom line.&quot;   In the end, the future of environmental investing maydepend heavily on people such as Stuart Ruddick, a31-year-old Bear Stearns broker in San Francisco. An avidwindsurfer, he has started a group called &quot;Windsurfers forClearer Water.&quot; Munching on a hearts-of-lettuce salad in aSan Francisco restaurant, he comments: &quot;San Francisco Bay isalmost dead because of toxic pollutants dumped into thewater.&quot;   But in investing, &quot;my bias is to make money for myclients,&quot; Mr. Ruddick says. &quot;I'm not a socially responsibleinvestor. I'm looking for companies with good products thatare well-positioned to take advantage of the clean air andwater acts.&quot;   As the U.S. and other countries gear up to tackle suchproblems, many more people may discern a confluence ofself-interest and social good. &quot;Investment professionals havea choice,&quot; says Ms. Harvey of Prudential-Bache. &quot;They caneither view it as a dreadful bother that interferes with thefree flow of capital -- or a fantastic new businessopportunity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
