Introduction </ITAG>In August 1980, EPA extensively revised its regulations concerning thepreconstruction review of new and modified stationary sources under theAct, 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642, in response to <T3>Alabama Power Company</T3> v. <T3>Costle,</T3> (the <T3>Alabama Power</T3> case) 636 F.2d 323 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (see 45 FR 52676,August 7, 1980). Five sets of regulations resulted from those revisions.One set, 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly 40 CFR 51.24), specifies the minimum requirementsthat a prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) \1\<NOTE/> program must contain in order to warrant approval by EPAas a revision to a SIP under section 110 of the Act. Another set, 40 CFR52.21, establishes the Federal PSD program, which is currently appliedin many States as part of the SIP. Another set, consisting of two regulations,40 CFR 51.165 (a) and (b) (formerly 40 CFR 51.18 (j) and (k)), specifiesthe elements of an approvable State permit program for preconstructionreview in, or affecting, nonattainment areas. The fourth set, 40 CFR Part51, Appendix S, embodies the  nonattainment area Emissions Offset InterpretativeRuling (Offset Ruling), previously revised in January 1979 (44 FR 3273).The fifth set, 40 CFR 52.24, embodies the construction moratorium whichapplies in certain nonattainment areas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A PSD program refers to requirements that must be metin an area designated as being in attainment of a national ambient airquality standard (NAAQS) or unclassifiable (see 40 CFR 51.166 and 52.21).Areas that are designated as nonattainment for a NAAQS must meet certainother requirements aimed at ultimate attainment of the NAAQS (see, e.g.,40 CFR 51.165(a) (formerly 40 CFR 51.18(j)) and 52.24). In the fall of 1980, numerous organizations petitioned the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the D.C. Circuit to review various provisions of those PSDand nonattainment preconstruction regulations. The court consolidated thosepetitions with a collection of challenges to the 1979 revisions to theOffset Ruling in <T3>Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA)</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> No. 79-1112 (D.C. Cir.). In June 1981, EPA began negotiationswith the industry petitioners to settle the <T3>CMA</T3> case. The EPA entered into a comprehensive settlement agreementwith the <T3>CMA</T3> petitioners in February 1982. Subsequently, the court granteda stay of the case pending implementation of the settlement agreement.In the settlement agreement, EPA committed to propose certain amendmentsset forth in Exhibit A to eight parts of the regulations pertaining tonew source review (NSR or preconstruction review) \2\<NOTE/>, to provide guidance in three additional areas, and to takefinal action on the proposals. On August 25, 1983, EPA published a noticeof proposed rulemaking in accordance with that agreement (48 FR 38742).Among other things, EPA proposed to delete from certain provisions therequirement that controls or limitations on a source's emissions must be``federally enforceable'' (i.e., enforceable by EPA) in order to be consideredin determining whether a new or modified source will be ``major'' and thereforesubject to PSD or nonattainment permitting requirements (applicabilitydetermination). The EPA also proposed to delete the requirement in andSection;51.18(j)(3)(ii)(e) (now andSection; 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(e)) that emissions reductionsobtained by one source from another (offsets) in order to obtain a nonattainmentpermit be federally enforceable.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ An NSR, or preconstruction review, is required as partof a SIP under 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I (formerly 40 CFR 51.18 and 51.24)to ensure that construction or modification of a source will not causeviolations of the State's control strategy or interfere with attainmentor maintenance of a NAAQS. An NSR program includes permit programs satisfyingthe Act's requirements for review of major stationary sources in nonattainmentand PSD areas (40 CFR 51.165(a) and 51.166) under circumstances describedin more detail later in this notice. In addition to the major source NSRprovisions, which are the focus of this rulemaking, virtually all Stateshave a general NSR program applying to most minor sources.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A basic requirement of nonattainment NSR of a potentialmajor source is that the applicant for a nonattainment construction permitmust show that its new emissions will be offset by emission reductionselsewhere (42 U.S.C. 7503(1)).In the August 25, 1983 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Administratorstated that EPA would review comments on the proposed amendments carefullyand with an open mind in order to make an independent judgment on theirmerits prior to taking any final action. The EPA has since received extensivepublic comment, including that presented at a public hearing held on September29, 1983. Today EPA is taking final action on the proposed changes to the ``Federalenforceability'' provisions. Essentially, as discussed in detail below,EPA is retaining the existing ``Federal enforceability'' requirements withoutchange. However, EPA is amending the definition of ``federally enforceable''and 40 CFR 52.23 to specify that State-issued operating permits are federallyenforceable under certain circumstances. In another notice being publishedtoday, EPA is also taking final action on the remaining August 25, 1983rulemaking proposals. Accordingly, today's final actions fulfill EPA'scommitments under Exhibit A of the <T3>CMA</T3> settlement agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background of Federal Enforceability Requirements </ITAG>The five sets of PSD and nonattainment regulations promulgated in 1980aim their substantive preconstruction review requirements at new ``majorstationary sources.'' Each set of rules defines a ``major stationary source''as any stationary source that would have the potential to emit certainspecified amounts of air pollutants (e.g., 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(iv) and52.21(b)(1)). In each case, ``potential to emit'' is then defined as the``maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under itsphysical and operational design,'' but any limitation \4\<NOTE/> on the capacity of a source to emit a pollutant is treatedas part of its design only if the control or limitation is federally enforceable(e.g., id. at andSection;andSection; 51.165(a)(1)(iii) and 52.21(b)(4)). Theregulations then define ``federally enforceable'' as ``enforceable by theAdministrator'' (e.g., id. at andSection; 52.21(b)(17)).\5\<NOTE/> The definition of ``federally enforceable'' adds that limitationsthat are enforceable by the Administrator include (but are not limitedto) limitations imposed by: (1) The SIP itself, (2) a Federal PSD constructionpermit issued under 40 CFR 52.21 or any construction permit issued underregulations approved by EPA in accordance with Subpart I of 40 CFR Part51 or 40 CFR 51.166, (3) a new source performance standard (NSPS) promulgatedunder section 111 of the Act (see 40 CFR Part 60), or (4) a national emissionstandard for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated under section112 (see 40 CFR Part 61). In practice, EPA previously has declined to considermost other types of limitations as being ``federally enforceable,'' includinglimitations that are enforceable by the Administrator under statutes otherthan the Clean Air Act.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ As used in the rules and throughout this notice, ``limitations''on a source's capacity to emit include such things as pollution controlequipment, restrictions on operating hours, and restrictions on types orquantity of fuels to be used (see 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(iii)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The EPA's primary enforcement authority in such casesderives from section 113 of the Act, which authorizes EPA, under certainconditions, to enforce violations of a SIP and of certain orders and emissionsstandards. The EPA may also enforce, under section 304(a) of the Act, againstany person: (1) Who violates any emissions standard or limitation (or orderissued) under such standards or limitations, (2) or who constructs anynew or modified major stationary source without a proper PSD or nonattainmentconstruction permit, or (3) who violates any conditions of such a permit. In effect, those definitions require EPA and State authorities, in calculatingthe potential to emit of a proposed new source for a particular pollutant,to assume that the source would emit the pollutant at the maximum ratethat the source could physically emit it, unless the source were subjectto a limitation on its operation that EPA could enforce directly. Each of the five sets of regulations also aims its substantive NSR requirementsat ``major modifications,'' a term which includes any significant net emissionsincrease at a major stationary source. The accounting system for determiningsuch significant increases closely parallels the one described above fordetermining whether new sources exceed specific emission thresholds \6\<NOTE/> (e.g., id. at andSection; 52.21(b)(2)). Specifically, the regulationsdefine a ``net emissions increase'' as the amount by which the sum of:(1) The increase in ``actual'' emissions from the proposed change, and(2) any contemporaneous and otherwise ``creditable'' increases and decreasesin ``actual'' emissions at the source would exceed zero (e.g., id. at andSection;52.21(b)(3)(i)). The regulations then provide that a contemporaneous decreasein emissions is creditable only to the extent that it ``is federally enforceableat and after the time that actual construction on the particular changebegins'' (e.g., id. at andSection; 52.21(b)(3)(vi)(b) (emphasis added)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ For PSD purposes, pollutants currently included in thisreview are: (1) The pollutants for which a NAAQS, NSPS, or NESHAP exists;and (2) their precursors (e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(2)(i) and (b)(23)(i)).For nonattainment purposes, they are the pollutants for which NAAQS existand their precursors (see 45 FR 52711 (August 7, 1980)(col. 3); 40 CFR51.165(a)(1)(v)(A)).Since a proposed new unit at an existing source has yet to produce emissions,each set of regulations also defines the actual emissions of any such changeas its potential to emit (e.g., id. at andSection; 52.21(b)(21)(iv)). Thedefinition of ``potential to emit,'' as noted above, contains a requirementfor Federal enforceability of controls and limits.Finally, for sources already in operation, each set of regulations providesthat actual emissions, when they cannot be determined, may be presumedto equal any source-specific allowable emissions for the unit (e.g., id.at andSection; 52.21(b)(21)(iii)). The definition of allowable emissions,like the definition of potential to emit, also requires, in many cases,Federal enforceability of any applicable limitations (e.g., id. at andSection;52.21(b)(16)).The general purposes of the Federal enforceability requirements were: (1)To corroborate, through the procedures for obtaining SIP revisions or federallyapproved construction permits, that any voluntarily imposed limits on asource's capacity to emit are, in fact, part of its physical and operationaldesign, and that any claimed limitations will be observed; (2) to ensurethat an entity with strong enforcement capability has legal and practicalmeans to make sure that such commitments are actually carried out; and,generally, (3) to support the goal of the Act that EPA be able to enforceall relevant features of SIP's that are necessary for attainment and maintenanceof NAAQS and PSD increments (see 48 FR 38748, August 25, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Amendments to the Federal Enforceability Requirements</ITAG>Shortly after the Federal enforceability requirements were promulgated,several parties to the <T3>CMA</T3> settlement agreement, representing industry, challenged requirementsfor Federal enforceability in the ``potential to emit'' and ``net emissionsincrease'' definitions, in court and in administrative petitions for reconsideration.They claimed that the Federal enforceability requirements were unnecessaryand unduly burdensome. Specifically, they claimed that each approved SIPalready prohibits construction of a new major stationary source or majormodification without a PSD or nonattainment construction permit. Accordingly,any company that builds a project that emits, or has the potential to emit,pollution in excess of the applicable thresholds for classification as``major,'' without first obtaining such a permit, would be in violationof the law and therefore subject to subsequent enforcement action by EPA.Thus, they argued, EPA does not need the Federal enforceability requirementto deter a source operator from using a non-Federal control or limit toescape PSD or nonattainment NSR and then violating those controls or limitssince, even if EPA could not enforce the limitations, it could enforcethe prohibition against construction or modification without a PSD or nonattainmentpermit and shut down the source.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The industry parties apparently assumed EPA would be awareof any actual violations of limitations and thresholds, but did not elaborateon that or on how monitoring of actual emissions would be as effectivein preventing violations as the current regulations.The petitioners also pointed out that, to obtain a federally enforceablelimitation, a company would have to apply to the State agency for the changeand then await whatever public procedures and EPA scrutiny were required.As a result, industry contended, a company could experience substantialexpense and delay just in obtaining the necessary limitation.In the August 25, 1983 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA stated preliminarilythat the Federal enforceability requirement might be unnecessary to someextent and that it would consider deleting it. The proposal was based onthe possibility of delay and consequent expense that could arise from processingcertain construction permit limitations or revising the SIP to make theapplicable limitations federally enforceable. However, EPA emphasized thatit still intended to achieve the purposes for which Federal enforceabilitywas originally designed (48 FR 38748, August 25, 1983). Nonetheless, EPAwas inclined at that time to think that the purposes of the Federal enforceabilityrequirements could also be served by a requirement that limitations beenforceable by State or local governments, provided that such limitationswere discoverable by EPA and the public (id). Accordingly, EPA proposedto: (1) Delete the word ``federally'' from the term ``federally enforceable''in the definitions of ``potential to emit,'' ``net emissions increase,''``allowable emissions,'' and ``major modification,''\8\<NOTE/> and from andSection; 51.18(j)(3)(ii)(e) (now andSection; 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(e))(regarding offsets);\9\<NOTE/> and (2) to replace the definition of ``federally enforceable''with an expanded definition of ``enforceable'' (including discoverablelimitations enforceable under State or local law). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The definitions of ``major modification'' exempt fromapplicability determinations certain increases in operating hours and switchesin fuel or material used, unless the increase or switch is barred by afederally enforceable limit (e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(2)(iii)(e)(1)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Although external offsets are not used to avoid nonattainmentNSR, the purposes of requiring Federal enforceability of such offsets areessentially the same as for requiring Federal enforceability of limitationsused to avoid such review.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary of Comments on August 1983 Proposal\10\</ITAG>A. Comments Generally Supporting the ProposalAs<NOTE/> expected, many industry representatives expressed strongsupport for the proposed deletion of the Federal enforceability requirements.Most of these comments also supported the proposed new definition of ``enforceable,''although two industry associations suggested that no definition of ``enforceable''was necessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ A more detailed ``Summary of Comments'' has been placedin the public docket for this rulemaking.In addition to the arguments discussed in the preceding section, the industrycommenters made several general assertions in support of the proposal.First, they argued that since State and local operating permits and otherrequirements are still enforceable by the non-Federal authorities, sourceoperators would comply with the State and local limitations even withoutFederal enforcement. Second, several commenters claimed that Federal enforceabilityrequirements are inconsistent with the requirement in section 101 of theAct that State and local authorities be given primary responsibility forpreventing and controlling air pollution. Third, all the industry commentersasserted that elimination of the Federal enforceability requirement wouldsubstantially reduce red tape and the delays and costs of obtaining a federallyenforceable permit or SIP limitation. Fourth, several commenters claimedthat Federal enforceability in the definition of ``potential to emit''is inconsistent with the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appealsin the<T3> Alabama Power</T3> case, 636 F.2d 323 (1979). In that case, the courtclarified that a source's potential to emit must be based on actual emissionsor ``design capacity'' for emissions of a source, including the effectsof pollution control equipment required by law to be included in the design.The commenters argued that this focus on actual emissions or design implicitlyrequires EPA to give credit, in calculating a source's emission potential,for any controls or limitations required by State or local law or permits,even if they are not federally enforceable.Fifth, several commenters argued that citizen enforcement of State andlocal permit limitations under the citizen suit provisions of section 304of the Act would be preserved, even without the additional requirementof Federal enforceability, provided that the State/local permit processesare ``coherent'' and the permits themselves remain on file.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Two industry commenters also alleged that the 1980 Federalenforceability requirements were procedurally invalid because, in theirview, EPA did not provide adequate prior notice or opportunity to commenton the concept and lacked adequate record support for the requirement.The EPA disagrees with those comments and believes that the 1980 requirementswere a logical outgrowth of the preceding proposal (44 FR 51924, September5, 1979) and were amply supported by the rulemaking record at the time.However, those comments are now moot. Any possible procedural defects inthe 1980 rules regarding Federal enforceability have been cured by thisrulemaking. One commenter also suggested, contrary to the position EPA took in theproposal, that offset credits should be considered enforceable (by a State,if not by EPA) even if the source providing the offset is not bound toreduce its emissions by a permit or other State limitation, provided thatthe offset source stipulates to the State that it will reduce its emissionsand that the SIP allows such stipulations. The commenter argued that aState could enforce such a stipulation under its authority to prevent violationsof the SIP. B. Comments Opposing the Proposal Several State air quality programs and environmental groups strongly opposedthe proposed deletion of the Federal enforceability requirements on severalgrounds. First, the association of State and Territorial Air PollutionProgram Administrators (STAPPA) commented that even though State and localgovernments have primary pollution control responsibility, they need thesupport of a credible Federal enforcement program to be most effective.Two commenters asserted that Federal enforceability is the only effectivemeans of assuring, during applicability determinations, that limitationsare really intended to be observed and for assuring that offsets and limitsare actually implemented. These commenters apparently felt that State and  local enforcement is often less vigorous and effective than Federal enforcement,especially in light of the economic and other pressures some businessescan exert on State and local enforcement authorities. One commenter feltthat the procedures involved in obtaining a federally enforceable limitationor offset are the only effective means of assuring that EPA and the publichave a chance to identify and evaluate the intended limitation in advance.With regard to offsets, one commenter pointed out that section 173 of theAct requires offset commitments to be ``legally binding'' and that whenCongress enacted section 173, in 1977, it implicitly ratified EPA's OffsetRuling which required Federal enforceability. Thus, the commenter concluded,legally binding commitments probably refer to federally enforceable commitments.Finally, the same commenter argued that citizen enforcement of offset transactionsunder section 304 would only be effective, as a practical matter, if therecords of all such transactions are centrally located (i.e., at EPA'sRegional Offices) in a standardized system, as they are under the existingFederal enforceability regulations. This commenter also criticized theproposal as it would affect Federal enforcement efforts, since enforcementactions against sources already constructed could be more difficult thanaction taken prior to construction. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Decision and Response to Comments </ITAG>After consideration of the comments and reevaluation of the preliminarystatements made in the August 1983 proposal, EPA has decided to retainthe Federal enforceability requirement in all the provisions discussedabove. In addition, to provide full internal consistency within the Federalenforceability provisions of 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S (known as the ``OffsetRuling''), EPA is, in a separate document also being published in today's<T4>Federal Register, </T4> amending section IV.C.3. of the Offset Rulingto clarify that emissions offsets involving reduced operating hours orsource shutdowns must, like all  emissions offsets, be federally enforceable(see Appendix S, section II.A.6.(v)(b)). In light of today's decision,EPA will not add the proposed new definition of ``enforceable'' to theregulations. However, as discussed below, EPA is clarifying that Stateoperating permits may be treated as federally enforceable under certainconditions. This clarification will reduce any problems which may arisefrom the Federal enforceability requirements. The clarification is formallyindicated by slight amendments to the definition of ``federally enforceable''and to 40 CFR 52.23. A. Federal Enforceability Is Necessary to Ensure That Limitations and ReductionsAre Implemented Since sources may avoid the protective requirements of PSD and nonattainmentNSR by relying on State or local limitations or reductions, it is essentialto the integrity of the PSD and nonattainment program that such State orlocal limitations be actually and effectively implemented.\12\<NOTE/> The EPA continues to believe, as it did in 1980 (45 FR 52688-89),that Federal enforceability is both necessary and appropriate to ensurethat such limitations and reductions are actually incorporated into a source'sdesign and followed in practice.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Similarly, it is important to the statutory goals ofthe nonattainment permit program (e.g., that all new construction is accompaniedby offsets to assure ``reasonable further progress'' toward attainment,section 173(1)(A)) that external offsets from outside sources be actuallyimplemented. The EPA agrees with those commenters, including STAPPA, who asserted thatFederal enforceability is necessary to support State and local enforcementefforts. Although EPA believes that most State and local governments arecommitted to effective enforcement of their permit programs, it is true_asSTAPPA and some environmental commenters pointed out_that the level of  State and local enforcement is uneven, and that some States and localitieshave been unwilling or unable to enforce their programs effectively. Itfollows that, in the absence of a Federal enforcement capability to backup State and local efforts, there would be somewhat less incentive forsources to actually observe non-Federal limitations or, in the case ofoffsets, to make the reductions for which credit has already been given.The EPA cannot agree, contrary to the suggestions of some source operators,that State and local enforcement alone would always provide enough incentiveto source operators to ensure adequate compliance.The EPA also believes, as suggested by some environmental commenters, that,absent Federal enforcement capability, some State and local governmentswould be more susceptible to economic and other pressures from industrythat could actually make State and local enforcement less effective thanit currently is.\13\<NOTE/> Conversely, the presence of a Federal ability to enforcelimitations and reductions can give State and local bodies more leveragein dealing with sources to ensure compliance and should make such bodiesmore effective in their enforcement efforts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The EPA also recognizes, as pointed out by the CaliforniaAir Resources Board, that absent a nationwide, Federal enforcement presence,industry would be inclined to build, or move, sources to States with theleast effective enforcement efforts. Such a possibility would give businessesmore leverage over the State governments and could foster a competitionamong the States to actually relax enforcement efforts. The legislativehistory of the 1977 Act confirms that Congress intended the PSD requirements(by setting minimum criteria to be met in all States) to reduce such competition(H.R. Rep. No. 95-294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 140 (1977)).The EPA also agrees with those commenters who pointed out that the processesby which federally enforceable limits or offset reductions are imposed(e.g., public notice and comments, notification to EPA) are the best andmost reliable ways to ensure, in advance, that a source actually intendsto observe a limitation or make a reduction in the future. Whether thelimitation is contained in a SIP revision or a State permit issued underregulations approved by EPA and included in the SIP, public notice andopportunity for participation prior to construction is virtually guaranteed.At that point, EPA, or anyone else, can analyze the record to determine:(1) Whether a proposed limitation or reduction will produce the benefitsclaimed, (2) whether the applicant is seriously committed to the limitation,and (3) whether practical means to monitor compliance exist. Even thoughEPA has confidence that most State and local procedures would allow forsome sort of public scrutiny even if Federal enforceability were deletedand the proposed expanded definition of ``enforceable'' adopted, therewould be no assurance that every permit or limitation would receive effectivescrutiny. Similarly, as one environmental group pointed out, the current Federalenforceability requirement facilitates citizen enforcement of offsets (and,implicitly, other limitations) under section 304 of the Act, since allpermits and commitments meeting the definition of Federal enforceabilitymust undergo some public scrutiny and are kept in standardized files inEPA's Regional Offices. By contrast, without such a requirement, as underthe proposed definition of ``enforceable,'' the only records of many suchtransactions would be scattered around various State and local officesand would be more difficult to obtain. At a minimum, this could make citizenenforcement more difficult and costly and, therefore, less effective asa means of ensuring that limitations and reductions are actually implemented.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ In addition, it is not certain that nonfederally enforceableState permit limitations or other commitments could be enforced under section304 at all. That section allows citizen suits against any person who violatesany limitation under the Act or any order issued by a State with respectto such a limitation, or who proposes to construct or does construct amajor new source without a PSD or nonattainment construction permit (42U.S.C. 7604(a)(1)). While violations of federally enforceable permit limitationsmay be subject to section 304 citizen suits, violations of nonfederal limitationsor offsets arguably might not be. For the reasons discussed above, EPA disagrees with those industry commenterswho claimed that nonfederally enforceable State and local permits, if discoverable,would be an adequate substitute for Federal enforceability. The absenceof potential Federal enforcement could result in: (1) Less incentive forsources to observe limitations; (2) more pressure on, and incentive for,State and local authorities to relax enforcement; and (3) decreased opportunitiesfor effective citizen enforcement. Mere discoverability of permit limitationswould not necessarily correct any of these problems, although it couldcreate somewhat greater incentives for compliance than would exist withoutit. Moreover, discoverability could itself pose practical problems, forboth EPA and citizens, in those situations where the State or local permitprocess is incomplete or poorly organized or recorded. The EPA also believes, contrary to some commenters' suggestions, that EPA'sauthority to enforce the prohibitions in most SIP's and in the Act (seesections 110(a)(2)(I), 165(a)(1), 167, and 304(a)(3)) against constructionof major sources without a PSD or nonattainment permit (see also sections113 and 167 of the Act) is not a completely satisfactory substitute forthe current Federal enforceability requirements.\15\<NOTE/> The commenters claimed that if any sources escaped PSD ornonattainment permit requirements solely because of a nonfederally enforceableState or local limitation, and later violated that limitation, then EPAcould treat that source as major and enforce the construction prohibitionsto maintain the integrity of the PSD and nonattainment programs (see 40CFR 51.166(r)(2)) (formerly 40 CFR 51.24(r)(2)).\16\<NOTE/> However, the exercise of this authority depends in largepart on EPA's ability to show that the new source or modification is actuallyemitting a pollutant at levels above the relevant annual threshold. Thisis much more difficult in practice than showing that an instantaneous emissionslimitation in a federally enforceable permit has been exceeded. This isoften difficult to do as a practical matter and may be even more difficultin situations involving nonfederally enforceable permits or limitationswhere EPA had little or no notice of, or opportunity to participate in,that process. In addition, courts may be less willing to order strict compliancewith the PSD and nonattainment construction prohibitions in those situations(e.g., to shut down the major source until the appropriate permit is obtained),given the impact that such an order could have on the source operator'sinvestment and operation. In short, EPA does not believe that the abilityto enforce PSD and nonattainment construction prohibitions, in these cases,in the absence of current Federal enforceability, would be a sufficientdeterrent to prevent violation of nonfederally enforceable limitationsor to maintain the integrity of the PSD and nonattainment programs.\17\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The EPA did suggest in the August 1983 proposal thatthat authority would help make the Federal enforceability requirementsunnecessary (48 FR 38747). However, EPA did not suggest that this couldbe a complete substitute for the existing requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ In some such cases, the State probably could enforcethe PSD and nonattainment construction prohibitions as well. However, asdiscussed above, States may be less willing or able to do so in the absenceof potential EPA enforcement than they now are. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The comment of one industry source that stipulationsby a source to reduce emissions for offset purposes should be consideredenforceable by a State is now moot, since EPA has decided to retain theFederal enforceability requirement. In summary, EPA has concluded that the specific purposes for which theFederal enforceability requirement was originally intended, and to whichEPA recommitted itself in the August 1983 proposal, cannot be fully oradequately achieved in the absence of Federal enforceability. The EPA recognizesthat those purposes_i.e., corroboration prior to construction or modificationthat limitations will be included in a source's design and observed inoperation, and the presence of a strong enforcement authority capable ofholding a company to its commitments_can sometimes be achieved by Stateor local authorities implementing nonfederal limitations. However, in general,State and local enforceability alone will not fully assure that those purposesare met across the nation. Rather, State and local enforcement, supplementedby potential Federal enforcement of limitations, is a much more effectiveand efficient method of achieving those goals and protecting the integrityof the PSD and nonattainment NSR programs. The EPA also recognizes, however, as several commenters pointed out, thatthe Federal enforceability requirements could result in some lengthy andexpensive delays in obtaining federally enforceable permits or SIP revisions.However, some delays can be minimized by streamlined processes for certainSIP revisions, including the direct final rulemaking process (47 FR 27073,June 23, 1982). The latter procedure can often be used by EPA to processand publish noncontroversial SIP revisions in less than 6 months. Moresignificantly, today's action clarifies that States have the option ofimplementing a program pursuant to which State operating permits couldbe treated as federally enforceable. Pursuant to this approach, Stateshave the option of adopting certain permit processing procedures such thatoperating permits issued under them would be considered federally enforceable,with no need for the individual permits to be submitted as SIP revisions.Such a program can reduce the potential for delay which exists in the presentsystem, while serving to enhance the permitting process generally. B. Federal Enforceability Is Consistent With the Requirements of the Actand the Alabama Power Case Several industry commenters claimed that Federal enforceability is inconsistentwith various provisions of the Act and with the decision in the <T3>Alabama Power </T3>case. The EPA disagrees. First, EPA disagrees with those commenters who claimed that Federal enforceabilityis inconsistent with section 101(a)(2) of the Act, which states that regulationof air pollution sources is the primary responsibility of States and localgovernments. The EPA has always recognized this and encouraged and assistedthe States in exercising their responsibility. The fact is, however, thatthe Federal enforceability requirements do not supersede or interfere withState and local governments' responsibility or their ability to take theprimary role in regulating sources. Rather, as STAPPA recognized, the Federalenforceability requirements supplement and provide necessary support toState/local enforcement efforts. Indeed, as discussed above, Federal enforceabilitymay promote more effective State/local enforcement by giving sources moreincentive to comply and providing the States and localities more leverageover industrial sources. In any case, consistent with the primary roleof State/local governments, EPA generally would not get involved in enforcinglimitations unless those other bodies failed to enforce adequately. Moreover, the Act itself, far from requiring EPA to remove itself fromthe enforcement of limitations or offsets, expressly authorizes EPA toenforce violations of SIP's by any person (which includes many source limitationsunder the definition of federally enforceable), with due deference to State/localprimacy (see sections 113 and 167 of the Act). Thus, Congress intendedthat EPA play an important role in the enforcement of SIP requirements,and the Federal enforceability requirements are consistent with that intent.The EPA also disagrees with those commenters who claimed that the Federalenforceability of limitations in the potential to emit definition is inconsistentwith Congress' intent in using that term in section 169 of the Act.\18\<NOTE/> Those commenters pointed out that the court in the <T3>Alabama Power </T3>case found that a source's potential to emit mustbe based on its design capacity, including pollution control equipmentrequired by law to be installed and used at the source (636 F.2d at 354).However, the court declined to express any opinion on whether, and to whatextent, legal limitations on the operation of a source should be includedin a source's design capacity (id. at 355 n.73). The industry commenterssuggested, nonetheless, that Congress intended any legal limitations, includingoperational limits, whether or not enforceable by EPA, to be included ina source's design capacity.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The definition of ``major emitting facility'' in section169, which is based on a source's potential to emit, on its face appliesonly to the PSD program. However, those terms are equally applicable toNSR under the Offset Ruling, nonattainment requirements under Part D ofTitle I of the Act, and the construction prohibitions of sections 110(a)(2)(I)and 173(4) (see 45 FR 52689, August 7, 1980). Therefore, EPA's ``potentialto emit'' definition is the same in all the PSD and nonattainment regulations,and EPA's analysis of what Congress (and the court) meant by potentialto emit applies to all those regulations.  However, EPA does not believe that anything in the court's opinion, orin the language, or in the legislative history, of section 169 requiresthat every legal limitation, of any type, be included in a source's designcapacity. In fact, the court implicitly left it to EPA's discretion (inthe first instance) to determine what type of operational limits, if any,should be credited to a source (id.). The EPA believes that it is withinits discretion in requiring Federal enforceability of an operational limitbefore including  it in a source's design, consistent with the court'sanalysis of ``potential to emit'' (see 45 FR 52688, August 7, 1980). In the <T3>Alabama Power </T3>case, the court concluded that whether a sourceis major depends on its maximum actual emissions or its design capacity,which includes anticipated functioning of pollution controls (636 F.2dat 353). It then referred to pollution controls required by law as exampleswhere the functioning of such controls can be anticipated. Essentially,the court said that EPA must predict a source's future maximum emissionsin determining design capacity and that pollution controls required bylaw are a reasonable means of predicting such future emissions. Althoughthe court did not otherwise indicate how EPA should make such predictions,the court was evidently referring to predictions of actual emissions (id.).The EPA believes, therefore, that Congress (and the court) intended, orwould have intended, such predictions to be reliable and reasonably accurateprojections of future emissions.\19\<NOTE/> As discussed above, EPA does not believe that nonfederallyenforceable limitations are as likely to be as uniformly observed as federallyenforceable limits and that requiring Federal enforceability is the bestand most effective way to ensure maximum compliance by sources with limits.Thus, EPA believes that the Federal enforceability requirement is the mostappropriate and reliable way to predict maximum future emissions and thatit is, therefore, consistent with section 169 to define ``potential toemit'' to include that requirement (see 45 FR 52688).\20\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ In fact, the two examples the court gave (636 F.2d at353) of controls required by law_i.e., NSPS and SIP provisions_are includedin EPA's definition of ``federally enforceable.'' Moreover, as the courtindicated, Congress meant for major sources to be those that actually emitcertain amounts of a pollutant, either at present or in the future (id.).It would not make sense for a source to be given credit for future emissionlimitations if there is no reasonable expectation that those limitationswill actually be observed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ For essentially the same reasons Federal enforceabilityis an appropriate part of the definition of allowable emissions,'' whichmay be used to define a new unit's actual emissions in applicability determinations(e.g., 40 CFR 52.21 (b)(21)(iii)). Since Congress meant for the statutoryPSD and nonattainment requirements to apply only to sources actually emittingmajor quantities of pollutants, (see the <T3>Alabama Power </T3>case, 636 F.2d at 352-53), it follows that any methodused to estimate actual emissions (other than direct measurement) shouldbe as reliable and accurate as possible. Federal enforceability of emissionslimitations is the best available means of estimating actual emissionsfor a new unit which has yet to produce any emissions.  Similarly, EPA believes (as one commenter pointed out) that the Federalenforceability requirement in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(e), requiring allemissions offsets used to satisfy the nonattainment preconstruction reviewrequirements to be federally enforceable, is consistent with the requirementof section 173 that such offsets must be ``legally binding.'' The 1977legislative history of the Act supports that interpretation of section173. It is clear that Congress was well aware at the time that EPA wasthen operating under an early (1976) version of an Offset Ruling (41 FR55524, December 21, 1976) (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7502 note (1982) H.R. Rep.No. 95-294, supra, at 13-14, 208). Congress implicitly ratified the 1976Offset Ruling approach by giving each nonattainment State the option ofchoosing to remain under that Offset Ruling indefinitely, and by requiringthat that Offset Ruling remain in effect \21\<NOTE/> in every State, unless and until the State revised its SIPto comply with the nonattainment provisions in sections 172-173 (See 42U.S.C. 7502 note; H.R. Rep. No. 95-294, supra, at 208; H.R. Rep. No. 95-564(Conf. Rep.), 95th Cong.,     1st Sess. 156 (1977)). The 1976 Offset Ruling,in turn, required that offsets be enforceable by EPA as well as by Statesand private parties (41 FR 55530). As one commenter correctly observed,since there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intendedto revise that early Federal enforceability requirement in the Offset Ruling,it is likely that the reference to legally binding offsets in section 173was based on that same concept. Thus, 40 CFR 51.166(a)(3)(ii)(e) is consistentwith section 173.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Congress intended that EPA have authority to amend theOffset Ruling (see 42 U.S.C. 7502; H.R. Rep. No. 95-294, supra, at 211),as EPA did in 1979 and 1980. A few areas are subject to that Offset Ruling. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ For essentially the same reasons that Federal enforceabilityof external offsets is consistent with the Act, Federal enforceabilityof internal emission reductions as an element of avoiding nonattainmentor PSD permits is also consistent with the Act. Under the definition of``net emissions increase'' (e.g. 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3)), a modification ata source may escape classification as ``major'' if its creditable (i.e.,federally enforceable) emission decreases are large enough. If emissionoffsets in nonattainment permits must be federally enforceable, it makessense that internal reductions used to escape such permit requirementsshould be no less enforceable. Moreover, Federal enforceability is often even more appropriate and moreimportant for offsets in nonattainment permits than it is for limitationsthat are used by a source to avoid nonattainment permits. In the lattersituations, even if the limitations were not federally enforceable, EPAwould still have potential power to enforce construction prohibitions againstsources that subsequently become major by virtue of their failure to observesuch limitations. By contrast, without Federal enforceability of offsets,EPA would have no such leverage against an external offset source wherethat source fails to make the promised emissions reduction. For the samereasons that State and local enforcement are not, in general, an adequatesubstitute for Federal enforceability in the context of making applicabilitydeterminations, they are even less satisfactory in the context of offsets.C. Response to Other CommentsOne industry commenter, although urging EPA to drop the Federal enforceabilityrequirement in general, argued that EPA should retain Federal enforceabilityin the definition of ``major modification.'' That definition exempts certainfuel switches and increases in operating hours from being considered asmodifications, even if they would increase emissions from the source, unlessthose changes were prohibited by a federally enforceable (construction)permit condition. The industry commenter apparently feared that deletionof the requirement for Federal enforceability of such prohibitions in thatdefinition, as proposed in the 1983 notice of proposed rulemaking, wouldwork against industry since it would require many more fuel switches andoperating hour changes to be counted as modifications than under the currentrules. In fact, the commenter suggested that EPA increase the number ofchanges exempt from the modification definition by completely eliminatingany reference to prohibited changes.The EPA has decided not to amend the definition of major modification.The EPA believes that all NSR definitions should be as consistent as possibleand that deleting the requirement for Federal enforceability in the definitionof major modification would be inconsistent with its decision to retainFederal enforceability elsewhere. Moreover, the proposed revision of thatdefinition could have created confusion and uncertainty as to which Stateand local prohibitions were enforceable. The EPA also agrees with the commenterthat deletion of the word ``federally'' potentially could increase thenumber of prohibited fuel switches and other changes dramatically and couldlargely defeat the purpose for which the exemption was originally intended.On the other hand, EPA must reject the commenter's suggestion that thedefinition be revised to exclude all fuel switches and operating hour changesfrom being considered modifications. One of the purposes of the Federalenforceability provision in the current definition is to support the prohibitionsagainst such changes in SIP construction permits by making a violationof such a prohibition grounds, if the modification is major, for requiringa new PSD or nonattainment permit. The EPA believes this provision providesvaluable added incentive to sources to comply with their permit limitations,and EPA is not persuaded that it should give up that leverage.Another industry commenter suggested that if EPA deleted the Federal enforceabilityrequirements and substituted a broader definition of ``enforceable,'' asproposed, that the definition be narrowed to include only enforceabilityunder Federal, State, or local air pollution control laws. Since EPA hasdecided not to adopt the proposed definition of enforceable, that commentis now moot.D. General Enforcement IssuesAlthough EPA today concludes that it is appropriate to retain the Federalenforceability requirement, EPA agrees with the suggestions of some commentersthat its authority to enforce prohibitions against construction of majorsources which lack PSD or nonattainment permits through the ``source obligation''regulations (e.g. 40 CFR 52.21(r) (1)-(4)) is an important deterrent tosources which might otherwise construct without a PSD or nonattainmentNSR permit. Moreover, EPA believes that these regulations are significantlyenhanced by the presence of the Federal enforceability requirement. Ifthe permit obtained by a source is to be given status as federally enforceablein order to avoid NSR, it must have met the notice, source information,practical enforceability, and other strictures set forth in this document.These same qualities of a federally enforceable permit make it much easierto determine, at a later date, whether the terms or intent of the permithave been violated and, if so, what enforcement action is appropriate.There are three options available to EPA for when a federally enforceableState permit has been or will be violated.One option is simply to enforce, under section 113, the limitations inthe permit which enabled the source to avoid NSR in the first instance,with the result that the source retains its minor status. This is appropriatewhere, despite the permit violations, it appears that the source intendsto adhere to the emissions limitations in the future. However, EPA retainsthe right to enforce the PSD or nonattainment NSR violation as well.The second option is to invoke the ``source obligation'' regulations, e.g.,40 CFR 52.21(r)(4), and treat the source as major by requiring it to obtaina PSD or nonattainment major source permit. This course is appropriatewhere the source, through a change in business plans, or through the belatedrealization that its original plans cannot accommodate the design or operationallimitations reflected in its minor source permit, can no longer adhereto the limitations in that permit, and so exceeds them. As discussed inthe preamble to the 1980 regulations, this option is also appropriate wherethe source (after receipt of its minor source permit) notifies the permittingauthority in advance of its changed plans or expectations and the needfor a future relaxation of the limitations in its current permit, withoutactually violating those limitations before obtaining a major source permit(see 45 FR 52689). Under either set of circumstances, pursuant to the ``sourceobligation'' regulations, EPA treats the source ``as though constructionhad not yet commenced'' for PSD and nonattainment permitting purposes.The EPA believes that the exceedance or relaxation of a minor source permit,and the subsequent obtaining of a major source permit through compliancewith the ``source obligation'' regulation, may not routinely involve penaltiesor additional sanctions other than those provided in section 113 for anyperiod in which the source actually exceeded the limitations in its minorsource permit. The EPA today clarifies, though, that a third general enforcementoption is necessary and available under the Act and EPA's regulations incertain situations. This third enforcement option is appropriate where EPA determines thata source obtained a permit containing limitations allowing it to escapepreconstruction review as a major new source or major modification, notfor the purpose of adhering to those limitations for an appreciable periodof time in accordance with some legitimate business plan, but primarilywith an intent to construct, and possibly begin operation of, a major newsource or major modification without first obtaining a PSD or nonattainmentpermit. In such circumstances, EPA enforces the ``source obligation'' regulations,as in option two above, and requires the source to obtain a PSD or nonattainmentpermit ``as though construction had not yet commenced.'' In keeping withthe retrospective orientation of the ``source obligation'' regulations,however, EPA also looks to the beginning of actual construction on thenew source or modification for purposes of additional enforcement actionunder sections 113 and 167 as well. Thus, under these circumstances, EPAtreats the original permit obtained by the source, which previously allowedit to enjoy minor status, as not ``federally enforceable'' from the timeconstruction begins on the new source or modification in question. It followsthat EPA also treats the source's ``potential to emit,'' as defined in40 CFR 52.21(b)(4), as not being limited by the restrictions in the originalpermit. The net result is that EPA deems the new source or modificationto have been major ab initio, and EPA considers seeking injunctive relief,civil penalties, and criminal sanctions, as appropriate, against the sourceunder sections 113 and 167 from the beginning of actual construction. The EPA today also wishes to briefly discuss the need and appropriate circumstancesfor resort to the third enforcement option. As a general matter, it isabundantly clear that Congress intended the NSR provisions in Parts C andD to require preconstruction review of major new sources and modifications.See, e.g., sections 160(5), 165(a), 165(e)(1) and (2), 110(a)(2)(I), 172(a)(1),172(b)(6), and 173. The evident air quality planning and technology-forcingpurposes of the Act's NSR provisions make the reasons for Congress' choiceof statutory framework equally obvious. It is much easier, both in technicaland practical terms, to consider the air quality impacts and pollutioncontrol requirements of a major new source of air pollution before it hasbeen constructed and has begun operation rather than after. Nevertheless,there is a need to accommodate sources which, for legitimate business reasons,have constructed and begun operation as minor sources, but later discoverthat they now do, or in the future will, emit air pollutants at levelsthat will require them to be treated as major. In those circumstances,postconstruction review is unavoidable, and the ``source obligation'' regulationsin 40 CFR 52.21(r)(4) and elsewhere are designed to fulfill this need.At the same time, in keeping with the general legislative purpose, it isnecessary that EPA take steps to prevent owners or operators from turningthe statutory scheme on its head by using federally enforceable minor sourcepermits in a manner inconsistent with the statute and with EPA's intention.In particular, EPA must discourage sources that would manipulate the NSRsystem by improperly obtaining minor status for a new source or modification.This could occur, for example, where the owner or operator's purpose is,from the start, to construct a new source or modification that would notbe economically viable for any appreciable period of time if it were restrictedto emitting at minor levels. If the source could construct, and even beginoperation, under a minor source permit, and shortly thereafter obtain apostconstruction PSD or nonattainment permit when it is convenient to exceedminor emissions levels, with no possibility of other sanctions, it mightencourage many owners or operators to proceed in this fashion. The resultwould be that the exception_postconstruction review in narrow, unavoidablecircumstances_could swallow the general rule of preconstruction review.Thisresult was not intended by Congress or EPA, and cannot be allowed. It is not possible to set forth, in detail, the circumstances in whichEPA considers an owner or operator to have evaded preconstruction reviewin this way, and thus subjected itself to enforcement sanctions under sections113 and 167 from the beginning of construction. This is ultimately a questionof intent. However, EPA will look to objective indicia to establish thatintent. For example, if an application for a Federal PSD permit is filedat or near the same time as a State minor source permit, EPA will carefullyscrutinize the transaction. The EPA will also look carefully at the economicrealities surrounding a transaction. For instance, where it appears obviousthat a proposed source or modification, by its physical and operationaldesign characteristics, could not economically be run at minor source levelsfor an appreciable length of time, EPA will take notice. Examples includethe construction of an electric power generating unit, which by its naturecan only be economical if it is used as a base-load facility, that is proposedto be operated as a peaking unit, and the construction of a manufacturingfacility with a physical capacity far greater than the limits specifiedin a minor source permit. The EPA may consider how a project's projectedlevel of operation was portrayed to lending institutions, and may examineother records concerning projected demand or output. Significant discrepanciesbetween operating levels as portrayed in these documents and operatingrestrictions in a minor source permit would justify consideration of enforcementaction.The EPA wants to emphasize, that under the third enforcement option, itdoes not generally seek monetary penalties, or any remedies other thanthose provided in the ``source obligation'' regulations, except in thosecases where it believes it could show to the satisfaction of a court thata source owner or operator had obtained a minor source permit with thepurpose of obtaining, after construction, a major source permit, so asto evade preconstruction review. The EPA in no way seeks to discourageor intends to penalize those owners or operators who accept emissions limitationsin pursuit of legitimate business purposes, and who in good faith laterseek a relaxation of those limitations. As discussed above, the ``sourceobligation'' regulations and section 113 enforcement sanctions (for anyperiod in which minor source permit limits are actually exceeded) providea complete remedy in those situations. There is no need to revise the text of the NSR rules to explicitly providefor this third enforcement option. The ``source obligation'' regulationsdo not by their terms preclude_or even address_the issue of civil penaltiesor other enforcement action under sections 113 and 167. Similarly, it isnot necessary to specify in the definitional provisions that a minor sourcepermit obtained in order to evade the Act's preconstruction review requirementsis invalid for the purpose of ``federally enforceable'' limitations ona source's ``potential to emit,'' and cannot be used as a shield againstenforcement action. Implicit in any regulatory scheme is the unwillingnessto countenance fraud, misrepresentation, or other misuse, particularlywhere the result would contravene the underlying statutory or regulatorypurposes. Today's action clarifies the purposes served by the EPA regulationsin question and outlines the circumstances in which their misuse may leadto enforcement action.\23\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Today's action also serves to clarify that EPA neverintended that the source obligation regulations would serve to insulatea source owner or operator from penalties or other enforcement sanctionsin cases of fraud or other misuse involving minor source permits. Any contraryinterpretation that might be drawn from the preamble to the 1980 regulations(see 45 FR 52689) is thus inaccurate, and is hereby rejected. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. State Operating Permit Program </ITAG>A. Introduction As noted above, today's final action includes clarification of EPA's policyon implementing its definition of Federal enforceability. Under this policyclarification, all terms and conditions contained in State operating permitswill be considered federally enforceable, provided that the State's operatingpermit program is approved by EPA and incorporated into the applicableSIP under section 110 of the Act, and provided that the operating permitmeets certain requirements.\24\<NOTE/> This clarification of the Federal enforceability definitioncan minimize the time and expense required   to obtain federally enforceablelimitations. The EPA believes that by encouraging States to adopt federallyenforceable operating permit programs, EPA has largely satisfied certainobjections to the current definition of ``federally enforceable'' voicedby industry commenters. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Various local air pollution programs operate air qualityprograms under their own regulations, which are approved into the SIP.The reader should understand that ``State'' operating permit programs encompassthose local programs with jurisdiction over only part of a State as wellas to statewide programs. As discussed above, EPA recognizes that its previous application of thedefinition of ``federally enforceable'' could sometimes cause delay orexpense in obtaining a limitation or control that EPA considers federallyenforceable. That application of the definition treats, as federally enforceable,PSD construction permits issued under 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly 40 CFR 51.24)or 52.21, as well as all construction permits issued under regulationsapproved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.160-165 (formerly 40 CFR 51.18).\25\<NOTE/> Under andSection; 52.23, ``[f]ailure to comply with * * * anypermit condition or permit denial issued pursuant to approved or promulgatedregulations for the review of new or modified stationary or indirect sources''is a violation of the implementation plan and may result in enforcementaction under section 113 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Sections 51.160-163 [formerly andSection; 51.18 (a)-(i)]specify criteria for all new sources under section 110 (a)(2)(D) and (a)(4)of the Act that NSR programs must meet to be included in a SIP. Sections51.165 (a) and (b) (formerly andSection; 51.18 (j) and (k) , respectively,establish additional criteria that must be met for approval of constructionpermit programs under Part D of the Act for major new sources in nonattainmentareas. However, EPA may also approve construction permit programs meetingandSection;andSection; 51.160-51.163 that do not satisfy andSection; 51.165(a)or (b), including construction permit programs for nonmajor sources. Permitsissued under programs approved pursuant to andSection;andSection; 51.160-51.163are federally enforceable. The EPA has always been concerned with the prompt processing of SIP revisionsand permits. For example, to minimize delay in processing certain typesof SIP revisions, EPA previously set up a streamlined process called directfinal rulemaking (47 FR 27073 (June 23, 1982)). That process can shortenEPA's time for processing SIP revisions, in noncontroversial cases,   toless than 6 months. The EPA will continue to use that procedure to processsource-specific SIP limitations whenever possible. The EPA is today emphasizing a more fundamental way to minimize delay andexpense. Specifically, EPA is expressly expanding its definition of ``federallyenforceable'' to include limitations and controls imposed in State operatingpermits, provided that the applicable State operating permit program hasbeen approved by EPA as meeting certain conditions and has been incorporatedin an appropriate SIP, and that the permit in fact conforms to the requirementsof the approved program. B. Discussion State operating permit programs, although in common use in many States,have not been required to be included in the SIP,\26\<NOTE/> although some States have voluntarily submitted various typesof operating permit programs to EPA for approval and inclusion in a SIP.The EPA has authority to approve such programs into SIP's under section110(a)(2) (B) and (D) of the Act. A few of these programs (e.g., Oregon's,49 FR 36843 (September 20, 1984) and 51 FR 12324 (April 10, 1986) and Idaho's,51 FR 22811 (June 23, 1986)) provide for sophisticated permit review andprocedural safeguards. The EPA has already concluded that permits issuedunder those programs are federally enforceable. In addition, some Stateshave operating permit programs that are not included in a SIP.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act does require that a SIPinclude a ``program to provide for * * * regulation of the modification,construction, and operation of any stationary source including'' permittingprograms for major sources. Similarly, section 172(b)(6) requires thata nonattainment SIP ``require permits for the construction and operationof new or modified major stationary sources.'' However, those statutoryprovisions regarding operation of a source are satisfied by the requirementin EPA's rules that the terms of a PSD or nonattainment construction permitremain in effect throughout the life of the source (unless modified lawfully)(40 CFR 52.21(w)(1)) (see also section 173 of the Act (treats nonattainmentpermits to construct and operate as if they were one)).Traditionally, with a few exceptions such as Oregon and Idaho, EPA hasnot considered State operating permits, per se, to be federally enforceable.\27\<NOTE/> However, EPA believes it has the authority to enforce limitationsin certain types of operating permits and to consider operating permitsas federally enforceable if they are issued pursuant to permitting programs(approved into the SIP) that meet the following criteria:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Although certain operating permits have not been consideredfederally enforceable, some of the terms and conditions appearing in suchpermits may be federally enforceable through other means. For example,if the terms of an operating permit are the same as those in a federallyenforceable construction permit or the same as the limitations in a SIPor an NSPS, those terms are federally enforceable by virtue of EPA's authorityto enforce the construction permit, the SIP, and the NSPS, but not theoperating permit.(1) The State operating permit program (i.e., the regulations or otheradministrative framework describing how such permits are issued) is submittedto and approved by EPA into the SIP.\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ EPA wishes to make it clear that no State is requiredto include operating permit programs in its SIP. Participation is voluntary.(2) The SIP imposes a legal obligation that operating permit holders adhereto the terms and limitations of such permits (or subsequent revisions ofthe permit made in accordance with the approved operating permit program)and provides that permits which do not conform to the operating permitprogram requirements and the requirements of EPA's underlying regulationsmay be deemed not ``federally enforceable'' by EPA.(3) The State operating permit program requires that all emissions limitations,controls, and other requirements imposed by such permits will be at leastas stringent as any other applicable limitations and requirements containedin the SIP or enforceable under the SIP, and that the program may not issuepermits that waive, or make less stringent, any limitations or requirementscontained in or issued pursuant to the SIP, or that are otherwise ``federallyenforceable'' (e.g. standards established under sections 111 and 112 ofThe Act). (4) The limitations, controls, and requirements in the operating permitsare permanent, quantifiable, and otherwise enforceable as a practical matter.(5) The permits are issued subject to public participation. This meansthat the State agrees, as part of its program, to provide EPA and the publicwith timely notice of the proposal and issuance of such permits, and toprovide EPA, on a timely basis, with a copy of each proposed (or draft)and final permit intended to be federally enforceable. This process mustalso provide for an opportunity for public comment on the permit applicationsprior to issuance of the final permit.States are free to continue issuing operating permits that do not meetthe above requirements. However, such permits would not be ``federallyenforceable'' for NSR and other SIP purposes. The EPA anticipates thatsome States may choose to continue current practices rather than altertheir permit programs so as to render operating permits federally enforceable,particularly with respect to small sources. Other States may wish to subjectonly certain types or classes of permits to these requirements. For example,a State may decide to not follow public participation procedures for, andnot submit to EPA, large numbers of permits for very small sources, becausethe State has no intention of using such permits as external emissionsoffsets, to qualify as a minor source or ``net out'' of NSR, or to demonstrateattainment of the NAAQS. The EPA expects that States will, for purposesof clarity and administrative efficiency, indicate within the federallyenforceable permits that they are being accorded such status.The above five criteria are modeled on the requirements for issuance offederally enforceable construction permits. The first two general requirementsoutlined above are necessary so that EPA can invoke sections 113 and 167of the Act and 40 CFR 52.23 to enforce the terms of the operating permit.These provisions essentially allow EPA to enforce against violations ofan applicable SIP. By making the operating permit program part of the SIPand legally requiring, in the SIP, that permittees comply with such permits,any violation of such a permit will be enforceable under the SIP and subjectto EPA enforcement.\29\<NOTE/> In addition, by providing that an operating permit whichdoes not conform to a SIP-approved program and EPA's underlying regulationsmay be deemed not ``federally enforceable'' by EPA, sources and Statesare placed on notice that EPA may find that such nonconforming permitscannot be used as external emissions offsets or to ``net out'' of PSD ornonattainment permitting requirements, or be considered as part of a State'sdemonstration of reasonable further progress toward attainment and maintenanceof the NAAQS. Thus, for example, a State may issue an operating permitplacing emissions limitations on an existing emissions unit at a sourcefor the purpose of accommodating a new emissions unit at the source withouttriggering PSD review of the new emissions unit. If EPA later determinesthat permit conditions do not comport with EPA standards for enforceability,it may notify the permit-issuing agency and the source that EPA intendsto enforce against the source for violations of PSD requirements regardingthe new emissions unit if the operating permit conditions for the existingunit are not changed to EPA's satisfaction. For example, should EPA findthat the limitations on the existing unit are not, in practical terms,enforceable (e.g., because of excessively long averaging times), EPA maydeem those limitations not federally enforceable for purposes of the nettingtransaction, thereby triggering PSD review of the new unit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Section 52.23 also provides that a violation of a conditionin a permit issued pursuant to an approved regulation for review of newor modified sources is also a violation of the SIP.The third condition is appropriate for two reasons. First, operating permitconditions that are at least as tight as existing SIP limitations willbe consistent with, and promote the purposes of, section 110(a)(2)(B) ofthe Act, which requires all approvable SIP's to include ``such * * * measuresas may be necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance'' of nationalambient standards.\30\<NOTE/> Moreover, section 116 provides that where an emissions limitationis in effect under an applicable SIP, a State ``may not adopt or enforceany emissions standard or limitation which is less stringent.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Requiring federally enforceable permit limitations tobe at least as stringent as other SIP limitations is also consistent withthe existing rules for NSR construction permits which require that suchpermits not result in violations of the SIP control strategy or interferewith attainment or maintenance of the ambient standards (e.g., 40 CFR 51.160(a)(formerly 40 CFR 51.18(a))).The permitting process may not be used to create exemptions from any requirementcontained in the SIP. Any such waiver or variance must be created througha formal SIP revision. The EPA also recognizes that, in some cases, individualscould differ as to whether a particular limitation is ``as stringent as''another limitation. The EPA encourages review authorities to express newlimitations in terms similar to those in the SIP (e.g., with respect toaveraging times) to facilitate comparison with the existing SIP limitation.Where compelling reasons weigh heavily in favor of expressing the new limitationin different terms than the current SIP limit, the burden to demonstratethe equal or greater stringency of the new limit rests with the State.Such demonstrations must accompany the proposed and final versions of anyapplicable permit action.The fourth condition for Federal enforceability_that the permit limitationsbe enforceable as a practical matter_is an essential element in EPA's implementationof the existing Federal enforceability requirement. If permit limitations,whether in operating or construction permits, were not practical to enforce,the purposes for which Federal enforceability was intended could not bemet. Thus, all emissions units must be reasonably described, and verifiable,enforceable emissions limits must be assigned to them. For example, anemissions limit expressed only in tons of pollution per year would notbe considered practically enforceable. Useful guidance as to what makesa permit condition enforceable is, however, contained in a document issuedby EPA on September 23, 1987 entitled ``Review of State ImplementationPlans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency.'' That guidancecontains a checklist which lists key areas to consider in determining enforceability.These areas include applicability, compliance date, specificity of conduct,any incorporation by reference, recordkeeping requirements, and exemptionsand exceptions.Similarly, the fifth condition_that EPA and the public be notified andgiven opportunity to comment on the issuance of operating permits_is consistentwith EPA's current practice for construction permits (e.g., 40 CFR 51.161(formerly 40 CFR 51.18(h))) and would make enforcement by EPA and privatecitizens much more effective and practical. Public notice and opportunityfor comment are important parts of an operating permit program, but theform of such notice is subject to debate. Some States regard individualnewspaper notices for permit applications as needlessly expensive and timeconsuming, especially since they process many permit applications but feware controversial. Several States have addressed these concerns throughthe use of State administrative registers, notice and distribution mailinglists, or monthly multiple application notices. In reviewing SIP submittalsfor operating permit programs, EPA will consider these and other techniquesfor meeting the twin goals of procedural completeness and administrativeefficiency as long as ample opportunity is provided for comment on permitsprior to their final issuance.   It is important that EPA maintain an effective oversight of permit decisionsmade pursuant to these programs. The EPA is not now implementing a formalreview program with procedural tools such as a veto provision to addressinappropriate permitting actions (see, e.g., 40 CFR 123.44 with respectto certain permits issued under the Clean Water Act). However, EPA willcomment on proposed permits as may be reasonable. The EPA stresses that,in order to implement this review, States will be required to provide draftpermits to EPA for comment. In addition, the State must provide EPA withcopies of all final permits upon their issuance. If permits are issuedinconsistent with the SIP as discussed above, EPA will consider those permitsto be invalid and will pursue such enforcement action as may be appropriate.It should be noted that EPA's intent is to review these permitting actionsin parallel with, and within the same schedule as, routine State proceduralsteps. The EPA intends to work with State programs to minimize any delayor intrusiveness from this activity.The EPA realizes that the above five program criteria are general and donot address many details of implementation. This is, in part, desirable:the EPA invites States to develop programs that are consistent with theirprogram needs and resources. The EPA will consult with States on the approvabilityof their particular plan proposals. (It should be noted that an operatingpermit program will not become effective for the purposes described inthis document until it is specifically so approved.) The EPA plans to issuefurther, more detailed, guidance as needed to assist States in developingand implementing approvable programs.C. Policy and RegulationThe EPA believes that the definition of ``federally enforceable'' is broadenough to include operating permit limitations under the conditions discussedabove, since it includes ``all limitations and conditions which are enforceableby the Administrator'' (id.). However, for the sake of clarity, EPA isamending the definition of federally enforceable to specify that operatingpermits issued under programs approved by EPA and incorporated into a SIPare federally enforceable.\31\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ The subject proposal of August 25, 1983, although notspecifically addressing this particular regulatory language, describedthe subjects and issues involved in detail. Today's regulatory clarificationto reflect the policy on Federal enforceability is a logical outgrowthof the 1983 proposal for which EPA concludes that further notice and commentare unnecessary.Similarly, even though 40 CFR 52.23_confirming that violations of SIP regulatoryprovisions and certain permits are subject to enforcement by EPA undersection 113 of the Act_is broad enough to cover operating permit violations(under the previous conditions), EPA is also amending that section to clarifyits applicability to operating permits. On the other hand, EPA does notbelieve that it is necessary to amend the ``source obligation'' regulationsat 40 CFR 51.166(r)(2) (formerly 40 CFR 51.24(r)(2)) and 52.21(r)(4). Asdiscussed previously, those sections require any source that was not subjectto PSD permit requirements because of any enforceable limitation, and thatlater becomes ``major'' solely because of a relaxation in such a limitation,to undergo NSR as if it had not yet been constructed. This is in additionto possible enforcement action for violation of federally enforceable permitterms or circumvention of the preconstruction review requirements of theNSR program. The source obligation regulations extend, as written, to anysource that used a federally enforceable operating permit limitation toavoid PSD NSR and later obtained a rescission or relaxation of that limitation.However, EPA will review each existing PSD SIP for any State seeking EPAapproval of its operating permit program to ensure that the SIP containsa provision meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.166(r)(2) with respectto operating permits. In such cases, if the current SIP provision doesnot extend to operating permits, EPA would require an appropriate SIP revisionas a prerequisite to approval of the operating permit program.      The EPA will respond to questions from the public on all of the operatingpermit issues discussed in this notice. In particular, EPA will respondto views on the need for further guidance specifying in greater detailthe substantive and procedural elements that should be contained in anapprovable operating permits program. In this regard, EPA points out thatany State program that contains essentially the same provisions indicatedabove as conditions ``1''-``5'' would almost certainly be approved by EPA.Useful examples of a State operating permit program are offered by Oregonand Idaho. Those programs provide that the proposed source and its projectedemissions and pollution control techniques must be described in detail.The programs also provide for notice to the public of permit applicationsand an opportunity to comment prior to permit issuance. The process isnot available for permits that would constitute relaxations of the SIP.Copies of each permit are submitted to EPA (e.g., Oregon AdministrativeRules, Chapter 340-20). The EPA is not now suggesting that every Stateprogram would need to be substantially the same as Oregon's or Idaho's,only that those programs could be used as models for an operating permitprogram that EPA likely will approve for federal enforceability purposes.The EPA will also consult with States on methods by which existing operatingpermits could be made federally enforceable under a subsequently approvedState operating permits program. The EPA suggests that in these cases,where a State can show that the existing operating permits were issuedpursuant to a program later approved by EPA, the State could also submitsuch permits in bulk as revisions to the SIP. Such revisions could be processedin much less time than if each permit were processed separately.\32\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Alternatively, a State might simply choose to wait untilit has an approved operating permit program included in its SIP and theneither renew or reissue existing permits under the approved program. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Miscellaneous </ITAG>A. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulatoryaction would be a major rule and therefore subject to the requirement forpreparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This action is not a majorrule because it merely retains the current regulatory requirements, whileoffering States a more efficient means of complying with those requirements.It, thus, will not have any significant new economic impacts. As required by Executive Order 12291, this action has been submitted tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Any written commentsfrom OMB on this action and any EPA written responses have been placedin the docket for this proceeding. B. Since today's action merely retains or clarifies the existing regulationsand does not promulgate significant changes to any rules, section 317 ofthe Act regarding an economic impact assessment does not apply. C. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant adverse impacton a substantial number of small entities, primarily because it retainsthe existing rules and creates no new burdens. Accordingly, no regulatoryflexibility analysis is required. D. The EPA has determined that this final EPA action has nationwide applicability.Accordingly, under section 307(b) of the Act, judicial review of this finalaction may be obtained only by filing a petition for review in the U.S.D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals within 60 days from the date of this notice.This action is not subject to judicial review in any subsequent civil orcriminal proceedings for enforcement. E. As provided by section 307(d)(1) of the Act, this rule is not subjectto section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 553(d) requiresthat substantive rules not take effect until 30 days after their publicationunless they relieve a restriction or an agency finds good cause to makethem effective sooner. Nevertheless, there is good cause to make this actioneffective immediately since it merely retains existing regulations whileoffering a more efficient means of implementation. Persons affected bythe ``Federal enforceability'' requirements need not change their activitiesor plans in any way as a result of today's action, and a 30-day waitingperiod would serve no purpose. F. Under Executive Order 12612, EPA must determine if a rule has federalismimplications. Federalism implications refer to substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. For those rules which have federalismimplications, a Federalism Assessment is to be made. The Executive Order also requires that agencies, to the extent possible,refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior totaking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take suchactions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presenceof a problem of national scope. The Executive order provides for preemptionof State law, however, if there is a clear congressional intent for theagency to do so. Any such preemption, however, is to be limited to theextent possible. This final rule essentially retains the current rule as written. The actionprovides an opportunity for certain State operating permits to be consideredfederally enforceable, thus increasing State options for addressing theapplicability of NSR rules to modified existing sources. Previously, thefederally enforceable limits recognized by EPA for existing sources generallyconsisted of more time-consuming SIP revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR</ITAG>Part 51Administrative practice and procedures, air pollution control, intergovernmentalrelations, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, ozone, sulfur oxides,nitrogen dioxide, lead, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide.Part 52Air pollution control, ozone, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, lead, particulatematter, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
