Its neurologicalunit has four new heart-monitors and state-of-the-art respirators.   But it has not had a patient in the last two years.   ``We have equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, but wedon't have the zlotys to pay the nurses so the equipment goesunused,'' said Dr. Andrzej Friedman, a neurologist at the hospital.   Around the corner, other rooms in the hospital are so crowdedthat critically ill stroke patients are kept on beds in thecorridor, a sight typical in many Polish hospitals.   Forty years after the communist government promised its citizensfree and adequate health care, the system itself is in criticalcondition.   Poles must pay at every stage for decent care.   Shortages of supplies requires, for example, there-sterilization and re-use of disposable needles, intravenousplasma units and catheters.   At the same time, Poles in general aren't careful about theirown personal health. They are among the world's heaviest smokersand drinkers and their diet is high in animal fat.   The state-run health service, however, puts a low priority onpreventive medicine.   ``The main difficulty now is the organization of the system andthe enormous bureaucracy. We are short of everything but we coulddo better with what we have if the system were better organized,''said Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a health adviser to the bannedSolidarity trade union.   The problems start with hospital buildings. Three-fourths aremore than 50 years old, according to a 1987 World Bank study, whichconcluded that half of the oldest hospitals should be replacedbecause they cannot be modernized.   One government solution has been to invest in such huge, modernshowcases as the Health Center for the Polish Mother in Lodz, apolluted industrial city in central Poland whose residents areamong the country's least healthy.   The center's attractive working conditions have drained doctorsand nurses from other facilities.   ``They (the government) are making these monument buildings thatare a real idiocy because they will serve only a few people,'' saidFriedman.   Diagnosis appears to be one of the weak links of the healthsystem. CAT-scans to assess brain damage can take two weeks toprocess and X-ray film is often faulty.   ``In our hospitals the machines only work a few hours a day,''said Kuratowski, the Solidarity adviser. ``People wait weeks forsimple procedures, blocking beds in the hospital, and sometimesit's very dangerous.''   She heads the Social Foundation for Workers' Solidarityestablished by the union to help administer a $1 million grant itreceived last year from the U.S. Congress. The foundation hopes toestablish three diagnostic clinics in Warsaw, Gdansk and Krakow,but plans have been delayed because the government has yet toofficially register the foundation.   Being a doctor or nurse is not financially rewarding. Atmid-career a doctor earns about 30,000 zlotys ($69) a month andnurses 18,000 zlotys ($41), less than the national average of42,000 ($97).   ``Because of the salary a lot of doctors are trying to emigrateor thinking about it,'' said Kuratowska. ``A young doctor does notmake enough money to create a stable life for his family.''   As a result, some take money on the side, she added.   ``People in hospitals must pay for just about everything andvery often, unfortunately, the doctors take money as a bribe.''   The cost to patients often runs high.   Admission to some Warsaw maternity wards is 100,000 zlotys($232); complicated cancer or heart operations can cost 500,000zlotys ($1,162).   And once a doctor has made a diagnosis, the patient must try tofind medicine, which though inexpensive by Western standards is inchronic short supply.   The government allows private or cooperative clinics to takesome of the pressures off on the state system, but treatment isexpensive. A tooth extraction in a private clinic can cost 15,000zlotys ($34), more than one-third of the monthly wage.   Although the government plans to reform the health system, itappears reluctant to endorse reforms that ideologically wouldthreaten the concept of socialized free medicine.   Kuratowska believes Poles should be allowed medical insurance sothey can recover some of their costs.   That, she said, would make things more equitable in afree-health system where people must pay anyway.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs July 18</NOTE></DOC>
