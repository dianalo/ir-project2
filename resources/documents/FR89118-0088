Overview </ITAG>This Order concerns Delta's request for registration as a clearing agency.\14\<NOTE/> Delta,\15\<NOTE/> together with RMJ Options Trading Corporation (``RMJ'') \16\<NOTE/> and SPNTCO,\17\<NOTE/> would operate the Over-The-Counter Options Trading System(``System''). The System would be designed to provide brokerage servicesand a central clearing facility for the over-the-counter (``OTC'') tradingof options on United States Treasury securities (``Treasury options'').\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The Division today separately issued a letter to RMJconcerning the registration requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the Act.<T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>and letter from Richard Ketchum, Director, Division, toRobert A. McTamaney, Counsel for RMJ, Carter, Ledyard, andamp; Milburn, datedJanuary 12, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Delta was incorporated in January 1988 in the State ofDelaware. Delta has a $9 million initial capital base and is owned by:(1) Dots, Inc. (72%), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cawsl Corp; and (2)SMG Options Corp. (28%), a New York Stock Exchange member and SEC-registeredbroker-dealer and investment adviser.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ RMJ is a registered government securities broker anda wholly-owned subsidiary of RMJ Securities, Inc., an inter-dealer brokerof U.S. government and agency securities with offices in New York, London,and Tokyo (``RMJ Securities''), which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiaryof RMJ Holdings, Inc.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ SPNTCO is a national bank regulated by the Comptrollerof the Currency (``Comptroller''). SPNTO is owned by Security Pacific Corporation,a bank holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System (``FRB'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Options traded in the System would be on underlying Treasurybills, bonds, and notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1 million.Terms of these options that would be uniform include the expiration date(<T3>i.e., </T3>the Saturday following the third Friday of the expirationmonth), the maximum duration of the contract (<T3>i.e., </T3>for Treasury bonds and notes, the earlier of two years fromthe date of issuance of the option or one month prior to the maturity orredemption date of the bond or note, and for Treasury bills, 13 calendardays prior to the maturity date of the bill), and the unit of trading (<T3>i.e., </T3>underlying Treasury securities in the principal amount of$1 million). Terms such as the premium, exercise price, expiration month,and the yield and maturity of the underlying securities would be subjectto negotiation between System participants. Delta would the the issuer of all options traded through the System. Withrespect to option trades accepted for clearance in the System, Delta wouldissue in book-entry form a put or call option to the purchasing participant\19\<NOTE/> and simultaneously purchase a matching put or call optionfrom the selling participant, thereby ensuring that Delta's short positionswould at all times be offset by corresponding long positions.\20\<NOTE/> Delta would guarantee the performance of all obligationsarising under these issued contracts (<T3>e.g., </T3>Delta would guarantee the settlement of premium obligationsand would assume the obligation to sell underlying Treasury securitiesat the strike price to the buyer of a call option upon the exercise ofthat option and to purchase underlying Treasury securities at the strikeprice from the buyer of a put option upon the exercise of that option).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Each put and call would be an uncertificated securityunder Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the Stateof New York, and, as discussed in detail below, ownership thereof wouldbe evidenced by a daily position report sent to the purchasing participant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ For example, assume <T3>A</T3> (purchaser) and <T3>B</T3> (seller) effect a transaction in which <T3>A</T3> agrees to buy a call in two-year 7.5% Treasury notes in an aggregateprincipal amount of $1 million, entitling <T3>A</T3> to acquire those notes at part at any time within a six-monthperiod. <T3>B</T3> agrees to write a six-month matching call against that positionfor a premium of $50,000. If the transaction is accepted for clearance,Delta would interpose itself in the trade by simultaneously (1) sellingto <T3>A</T3> a six-month call on the notes for a premium of $50,000 and (2)buying a matching call from <T3>B</T3> with identical terms and premium. In addition to issuing options and guaranteeing the performance of optionholders and writers, Delta would perform the following functions. First,Delta would be responsible for admitting participants to the System. Thisresponsibility would entail setting participant admission criteria anddetermining whether applicants meet these criteria. Second, as discussedbelow in detail, Delta would enforce its rules and procedures. Third, Deltawould set participant margin requirements, trading limits, and positionlimits. Fourth, Delta would make determinations concerning the suspensionof participants and direct the liquidation of a suspended participant'spositions in accordance with System Procedures. Finally, as described below,Delta would obtain and maintain a $200 million credit enhancement facility.A Delta participant trading through the System could proceed in one oftwo ways. The participant could instruct RMJ\2\\1\<NOTE/> to effect the trade with the <T3>contra </T3>party on an anonymous or ``blind'' basis\2\\2\<NOTE/> at the price quoted by the <T3>contra </T3>party through the communications network. RMJ would match\2\\3\<NOTE/> each brokered executed trade and report matched trades toDelta and SPNTCO.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\RMJ would provide brokerage services for System participantsand would disseminate option bid and ask quotations to participants throughan automated communications network. RMJ would own and maintain all computersoftware supporting the System, and RMJ Securities would own and maintainthe computer hardware, data transmission network, and communication interfacesupon which that software was designed to operate. In establishing thisautomated communications network, RMJ would: (1) Install video monitors,controller, keypads, and attendant equipment at a participant's tradinglocations; (2) install dedicated data communication lines between the RMJbrokering location and a participant's trading location; (3) install dedicatedvoice communication lines between the RMJ brokering location and a participant'strading location; and (4) provide field engineering support services tomaintain all equipment at a participant's location.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\Transactions in Treasury securities effected througha U.S. government securities broker typically are effected on a blind basis.Screens viewed by customers show securities' maturity dates, coupon rates,issuing agency, the best bid and ask prices quoted by customers for eachissue, and the quantities of securities each customer who provides a quoteis committed to sell or buy at the quoted price. The screens neither identifythe customers whose quotations are displayed nor reveal the depth of themarket (<T3>i.e., </T3>the number and size of other orders waiting to be executedat the displayed price). <T3>See </T3>U.S. General Accounting Office, U.S. Government Securities;An Examination of Views Expressed About Access to Broker's Services, GAO/GGD-88-8(1987) (``GAO Report'').  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\A trade matches if the writing or selling participantand the purchasing participant agree as to: (1) The identity of the otherparty to the transaction; (2) the type of option; (3) the variable termsof the option; (4) the amount of the premium; (5) the number of optionspurchased; and (6) the description of each party as either the purchasing,selling, or writing participant.   Alternatively, the participant could communicate with a <T3>contra </T3>party based on quotes in the System or otherwise, and proceedto negotiate the trade either through RMJ or without using the RMJ brokerageservice as an intermediary. Trades effected through RMJ or between participantswithout RMJ involvement would be reported by each participant to SPNTCO,which would match those trades and report them to Delta for clearance andsettlement.  Under a contract with Delta, SPNTCO would act as clearing bank for theSystem. All trades effected between participants would be submitted toSPNTCO for acceptance.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Under the contract and System Procedures, SPNTCO would accepta trade\2\\5\<NOTE/> if both sides of the trade match, the trade does not resultin a participant exceeding its trading or position limits, and neitherparticipant has been suspended from the System.\2\\6\<NOTE/> Upon acceptance of a transaction for clearance by SPNTCOunder Delta's procedures, Delta would issue the option underlying the transactionand quarantee the performance of obligations arising under that option. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\Trades effected between 9:00 a.m. (all times refer toEastern Standard Time) and 12:00 noon on a particular day must be submittedto SPNTCO for acceptance prior to 12:30 p.m. that day. Trades effectedbetween 12:00 noon and 5:00 p.m. must be submitted by 5:30 p.m. <T3>See </T3>section 401 of the System Procedures.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\Delta would not require participants to pay premiumsowed on an option as a condition to trade acceptance. As discussed below,a participant would make premium payment on the day after the option hasbeen accepted for clearance.    <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\As described below in detail, to estimate the maximumamount of liability to which the System could be exposed, Delta would calculatethe System's maximum potential exposure (MPSE). To the extent necessaryto ensure that MPSE does not exceed its prescribed limit, a participantmay be restricted from engaging in opening purchase or opening writingtransactions, required to reduce or eliminate existing long or short positionsthrough closing transactions, and required to pay addtional margin.   With respect to issued options, SPNTCO would perform recordkeeping andsafeguarding functions. SPNTCO would maintain on its books and recordsaccounts for Delta necessary to receive premium and margin payments fromparticipants, transmit payments to participants, and facilitate the settlementof exercised options.\2\\7\<NOTE/> SPNTCO wouldl safekeep all property and funds delivered toit for the account of Delta, as well as provide for the overnight investmentof margin payments. SPNTCO would accept and assign exercise notices andreceive and deliver funds and securities necessary for exercise settlements.\2\\8\<NOTE/> SPNTCO would prepare and distribute to participants dailymargin, position, and exercise reports.\2\\9\ <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\Each business day, a participant's premium and marginsettlement obligations would be netted to produce a single amount owedto or by the participant. By 11:00 a.m. each business day, a participantwould be required to wire to SPNTCO in same-day funds any amount owed bythat participant, as reflected in daily reports distributed to participantsby SPNTCO. By 5:00 p.m. each day, SPNTCO would wire to a participant insame-day funds any such amount owed to the participant by the System. Thus,Delta could delay, until 5:00 p.m., the payment of premiums of excess marginto participants who may be experiencing financial or operational difficultiesin connection with exercise settlements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\SPNTCO would accept exercise notices from holders between9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. daily. These notices would be assigned by SPNTCOby 8:00 a.m. the following day to a writer or seller of the option. Asdecribed in section 1002 of the System Procedures, these notices wouldbe allocated randomly. System rules require a participant delivering Treasurysecurities to SPNTCO pursuant to exercise settlement to do so by 12:00noon on exercise settlement date, against payment by SPNTCO on Delta'sbehalf. Similarly, a participant receiving Treasury securities pursuantto an exercised or assigned option would be required to do so by a 1:00p.m. on exercise settlement date, against payment to SPNTCO on behalf ofDelta. For Treasury bond and Treasury note options exercised prior to expirationdate, the exercise settlement date would be the second business day afteran exercise notice was assigned. For Treasury bond and Treasury note optionsexercised on expiration date, the exercise settlement date would be thethird business day following the expiration date. For Treasury bill options,the exercise settlement date would be the Thursday of the week followingthe week in which the exercise notice was tendered. In order to providethe necessary funds to meet payment obligations to participants deliveringsecurities to Delta, Delta will maintain credit facilities with SPNTCO <ITAG tagnum="28">\2\\9\The daily position report would detain all option contractsof participant and would show the net daily premium due to or from theparticipant as a result of those transactions. The daily margin reportwould detail the amount of margin required on a participant's short positions,while the daily exercise report would reflect exercise notices filed byor assigned to a participant. Those reports would be placed in participantslock boxes maintained on SPNTCO premises by 8:00 a.m. each business day.     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statutory Standards</ITAG>Section 17A of the Act requires a clearing agency, as defined in section3(a)(23) of the Act and subject to certain exceptions, to register withthe Commission.\30\<NOTE/> Delta, as issuer and guarantor of options traded throughthe System, falls within the section 3(a)(23) definition of a clearingagency and therefore is required to register with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ The term ``clearing agency'' is defined, in pertinentpart, as ``any person who acts as an intermediary in making payments ordeliveries or both in connection with transactions in securities or whoprovides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlementof securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securitiestransactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities.''<T3>See</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23) (1988).Subparagraphs (A) through (I) of section 17A(b)(3) of the Act set forthspecific determinations the Commission must make in granting registration.The Commission has published clearing agency registration standards (``Standards'')that provide additional guidelines concerning the Division's interpretationof subparagraphs (A) through (I).\31\<NOTE/> The Commission also notes that in adopting the GovernmentSecurities Act of 1986 (``GSA''),\32\<NOTE/> Congress stated that,<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41920 (``Standards Release''). The Commission notes that the Standardswere developed in the context of registration of 10 clearing agencies engagedprimarily in clearing domestic corporate debt and equity securities andto a lesser extent municipal securities. The Commission recognizes thatsome of the Standards may not be appropriate for clearing agencies thatprovide services for other investment products such as OTC options on Treasurysecurities. Accordingly, the Commission intends to apply the Division Standardsflexibly and on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See</T3> 132 Cong. Rec. S15790 (October 9, 1986). Prior to the enactmentof GSA, government securities were treated as exempted securities for purposesof section 17A, and clearing agencies providing services exclusively forgovernment securities transactions were not required to register with theCommission. Enactment of GSA removed the government securities exceptionfrom section 17A, requiring clearing agencies providing services for governmentsecurities, such as the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC''),to register with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="20">In providing for the applicability of the registration and other requirementsof Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act to clearing agencies forgovernment securities, the Commission has broad authority under Section17A_as well as under Section 23_to take into account the distinctions betweenmembership clearing agencies and proprietary clearing agencies.\33\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See</T3> 132 Cong. Rec. S15798 (October 9, 1986).Congress further noted that:<ITAG tagnum="20">The Commission, under the expanded scope of Section 17A, should recognizedistinctions between proprietary and membership clearing agencies, andexercise its discretionary authority to interpret and adapt the requirementsof Section 17A, where appropriate, to proprietary clearing agencies forgovernment securities.\34\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>Id.</T3> Commentators argue that Congress, in adopting GSA, intendedto subject Delta to all of the requirements of the Act applicable to registeredclearing agencies and for the Commission to grant Delta exemptions fromthose requirements would contravene Congressional intent. <T3>See</T3> CBT and CME letters. The Commission believes that grantingDelta's two exemption requests would not contravene Congressional intent.As noted above, Congress has directed the Commission to recognize the differencebetween proprietary and membership clearing agencies in applying the requirementsof the Act. As noted <T3>infra,</T3> Delta would be subject to all requirements of the Act applicableto registered clearing agencies except in two limited areas [<T3>i.e.,</T3> fair representation in the selection of directors and thefiling of certain corporate governance documents pursuant to Section 19(b)]in which the Commission believes Delta's proprietary nature justifies exemption.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>A. Scope of the OrderThis Order concerns the registration of Delta as a clearing agency undersection 17A of the Act for a period of 36 months. The determinations madein this order reflect a review of: (1) System Procedures; (2) the OperatingAgreement; (3) agreements between System operators and System participants;(4) Delta's certificate of incorporation and by-laws; and (5) all otheraspects of Delta's operations contained in its application. The Commissionexpects to review its determinations within 36 months to consider whetherto grant Delta permanent registration as a clearing agency. During thattime, the Commission will monitor and oversee Delta's operations throughreview of proposed rule changes,\35\<NOTE/> notices to members,\36\<NOTE/> and disciplinary actions.\37\<NOTE/> The Commission staff has interviewed Delta staff prior tothis Order and plans to inspect Delta facilities during the registrationperiod. The Commission also will oversea RMJ as a registered governmentsecurities broker under Section 15C of the Act and intends to consult withthe FRB and Comptroller who, as noted <T3>infra, </T3>regulate and examine SPNTCO. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Section 19(b) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder (17CFR 240.19b-4 (1988) require a registered clearing agency to file withthe Commission for review all proposed rule changes, including changesin its by-laws, rules, and procedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Rule 17a-22 (17 CFR 240.17a-22 (1988) under section 17(a)of the Act requires a registered clearing agency to file with the Commission,within ten days of release, three copies of any material, including manuals,notices, circulars, bulletins, lists, or periodicals issued or made generallyavailable to its participants or to other entities with whom it has a significantrelationship. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Section 19(d) of the Act and Rule 19d-1 thereunder (17CFR 240.19d-1 (1988) require self-regulatory organizations to file withthe Commission notice of: (1) final disciplinary actions; (2) denials;(3) bars; (4) limitations respecting membership, association, participationor access to services; and (5) summary suspensions. B. Capacity to PromotePrompt and Accurate Clearance and SettlementSection 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that a clearing agency be organizedand that its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible.As discussed below, the Commission believes Delta is organized and SystemProcedures are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement of System transactions.\38\<NOTE/> With Delta's registration, OTC Treasury options, for thefirst time, will be issued, cleared, and settled within a centralized,automated facility subject to Commission oversight. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Several commentators suggested that Delta has not demonstratedthe operational capacity of SPNTCO, and RMJ. As noted <T3>infra, </T3>the Commission is satisfied that SPNTCO and RMJ can providethe necessary equipment, expertise, and other resources. Market participants trade Treasury options to hedge against or speculateon changes in Treasury security\39\<NOTE/> interest rates.\40\<NOTE/> Market participants use Treasury options, for example, tohedge long Treasury security portfolios and in effect, to lock in a specificinterest rate in anticipation of future borrowing or lending activity.Although Treasury options are listed and traded on registered securitiesexchanges,\41\<NOTE/> many Treasury options are bought and sold on an OTC basisand significant risk transfer activity involving Treasury securities occurson futures exchanges.\42\<NOTE/> The Commission understands that OTC Treasury options servea unique role by enabling market participants to tailor option terms (<T3>e.g., </T3>coupon rate, expiration date, and strike price) to theirindividual needs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ The United States Treasury issues book-entry securitiesin the form of bills, notes, and bonds. Treasury bills are issued in minimumdenominations of $10,000 and have original maturities of 3, 6, or 12 months.Treasury notes are issued in denominations of $1,000 or more and have initialmaturities from 1 to 10 years. Treasury bonds are issued in denominationsof $1,000 or more and have initial maturities of more than 10 years. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Prices of Treasury securities move inversely with changesin interest rates. For example, a 30-year Treasury bond may be issued withan interest rate of 12% of its base price of 100. Investors generally willcontinue to pay approximately 100 for the bond as long as the interestrate is exactly 12%. However, if Treasury bond interest rates rise to 14%,the price of the bond may decline to 87 to yield 14%. Conversely, if Treasurybond interest rates decline to 10%, the price of the bond may rise to 120to yield 10%. Given this inverse relationship between prices and interestrates, generally the holder of a call option on a Treasury bond will profitfrom falling interest rates, while the holder of a put option on a Treasurybond will profit from rising interest rates. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Options on Treasury securities are traded on Amex andthe Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''). <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18371 (December 23, 1981),46 FR 64323. Futures products on Treasury securities are traded on theCBT, CME, and the Financial Instrument Exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ <T3>See </T3>Goodman, <T3>Hedging with Debt Options, </T3>in Handbook of Financial Markets: Securities,Options and Futures, 573 (1986). During 1987, options exchanges tradedapproximately 233,000 contracts on underlying Treasury securities accountingfor an average daily volume of nearly 1,000 contracts representing underlyingTreasury security values of approximately $100 million. Futures productsoverlying Treasury Securities are traded on future exchanges, cleared throughclearinghouses associated with those exchanges, and are subject to thejurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. On the ChicagoBoard of Trade, for example, in 1987 a daily average of over 800,000 futurescontracts or futures options on Treasury securities were traded representingunderlying Treasury security values of over $80 billion. According to theFederal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') staff, the average daily valueof secondary market trading in Treasury securities is $110 billion. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25740 (May 24, 1988),53 FR 19639, in which the Commission granted GSCC temporary registrationas a clearing agency (``GSCC Registration Order''). Treasury securities are auctioned to the public by the Federal ReserveSystem and are purchased in the primary market by banks and securitiesfirms operating as government securities dealers.\43\<NOTE/> Secondary trading in Treasury securities occurs in a decentralizedOTC market in which government securities brokers\44\<NOTE/> continually disseminate bid and ask quotations through automatedcommunications networks to dealers who trade between themselves on a fullydisclosed basis or through brokers on a blind basis. Because governmentsecurities dealers have access to current quotes and last sale informationfor Treasury securities, they stand ready to do a large volume of bothputs and calls on those securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ There are three types of government securities dealers:Primary, aspiring primary, and non-primary. Primary dealers voluntarilyreport their positions to the FRBNY and to buy from or sell securitiesto the FRBNY, among other things, in connection with FRBNY's (as U.S. fiscalagent) open market transactions. Primary dealers are designated by FRBNYbased on financial, trading and other criteria. Aspiring primary dealersare firms attempting to demonstrate their capital resources, trading activities,operational experience, and other qualifications to FRBNY to become a primarydealer. Any government securities dealer that is neither a primary or aspiringprimary dealer is considered a non-primary dealer. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> GAO report, <T3>supra,</T3> note 22; GSCC Registration Order, <T3>supra,</T3> note 22.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ There are two types of government securities brokers:inter-dealer and retail. Inter-dealer brokers arrange trades only amongprimary and some aspiring primary dealers, while retail brokers arrangetrades among all market participants meeting the brokers credit criteria.The current system for the clearance and settlement of OTC Treasury optionsis decentralized and inefficient in several respects.\45\<NOTE/> OTC Treasury options are confirmed via a labor-intensiveprocess in which brokers and dealers exchange confirmation slips, stampslips containing agreed upon terms, and return stamped slips to each other.This process often results in misplaced confirmation slips and uncomparedtrades. Premium, margin, and exercise settlement obligations for OTC Treasuryoptions generally are not netted but are deposited piecemeal through clearingagent banks over the automated payment and book-entry custody system (``FedWire'')operated by Federal Reserve banks. This process can contribute to demandson liquidity from the banking system, increased FedWire traffic,\46\<NOTE/> and increased transaction costs. Those demands and costsmight be avoided if a netting process were employed. The OTC Treasury optionsmarket currently also lacks sophisticated mechanisms designed to ensurethat parties meet their obligations. There is no third-party intermediarysuch as OCC or a futures clearinghouse guaranteeing the performance ofobligations arising under OTC Treasury option contracts\47\<NOTE/> and, although these contracts typically provide for the depositof margin by option sellers, such obligations aften are difficult to enforce.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ The exchange-listed Treasury securities options markethas a centralized, Commission-regulated facility for the issuance, clearance,and settlement of Treasury options. This facility, the Options ClearingCorporation (``OCC''), receives trade data from options exchanges and settlespremium payments in same-day funds between writing and purchasing clearingmembers on the business day after trade date. Upon payment of the premiumby the OCC clearing member, OCC ``accepts'' the trade and becomes guarantoron the transaction, crediting clearing member buyers with long positionsand debiting clearing member sellers with short positions on OCC's booksand records. OCC collects margin from clearing members with short positionsas part of its safeguarding systems to secure its obligations to optionholders and can call for the deposit of intra-day variation margin in certaincircumstances. OCC randomly assigns to clearing members with short positionsexercise notices OCC receives from option holders. OCC nets member paymentobligations, which are collected or paid in same-day funds each morningbetween 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Heavy FedWire traffic contributed to delays on the FedWireduring October 1987, contributing to the liquidity problems experiencedby many firms during that time. <T3>See Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms;</T3>submitted to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury,and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on January 8, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Some retail government securities brokers represent thatthey guarantee the government securities transactions they broker. Nevertheless,the issue of who bears the risk in the event of default in a blind brokeredgovernment securities transaction is the subject of some controversy. <T3>See</T3> GAO Report,<T3> supra</T3> note 22.Delta, in conjunction with its facilities manager SPNTCO, would providea clearance and settlement facility that may alleviate these inefficienciesand that may add greater discipline to transaction processing in this market.System trades would be submitted to SPNTCO for automated confirmation,thereby eliminating transfers of confirmation slips and reducing the likelihoodof uncompared trades. Payment obligations for System trades would be netteddaily, thereby reducing participant transaction costs and FedWire transfers.The performance of obligations arising under options issued by Delta wouldbe guaranteed by Delta. System participants would be subject to formalmargin obligations set by Delta and could be fined, censured, or suspendedfrom the System for a failure to meet those obligations. Furthermore, Deltawould have the ability to collect intra-day variation margin from participantsand would have access to a $200 million credit enhancement facility designedto help Delta meet its obligations in the event of participant default.Finally, Delta would assess the financial condition of System participantsprior to and throughout their participation in the System.C. Capacity to Safeguard Securities and FundsAs discussed in detail below, the Commission believes Delta has the capacityto safeguard securities and funds, as required by the Act.\48\<NOTE/> The Commission bases that determination on: (1) A reviewof System Procedures and Delta's facilities management arrangements withRMJ, RMJ Securities, and SPNTCO; and (2) representations by Delta's facilitiesmanagers regarding their capacity to safeguard securities and funds inthe midst of extreme market volume and volatility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and (F) of the Act require thata clearing agency be organized and that its rules be designed to promoteprompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities for which itis responsible and to safeguard funds and securities in its custody orcontrol or for which it is responsible. The Standards require clearingagencies, such as Delta, that hire facilities managers to perform dataor other processing functions to maintain appropriate safeguards to insurethe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.The Standards also require such clearing agencies to assure that theirfacilities managers will cooperate fully with clearing agency auditors,Commission examiners, independent public accountants, and any other appropriateregulatory agency, to the same extent as a clearing agency which conductsits own processing functions. <T3>See</T3> Standards Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 31.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Facilities Management, Recordkeeping, and Data Processing</ITAG>Delta has a facilities management agreement with SPNTCO under which SPNTCOwould provide certain clearance and settlement services pursuant to Delta'sinstructions and in accordance with System Procedures. As noted, thoseservices include: (1) Trade matching and acceptance; (2) participant accountmaintenance; (3) the collection, transmission, and safeguarding of securitiesand funds; (4) the preparation and distribution of daily reports; and (5)the collection, assignment, and distribution of exercise notices.Commentators question SPNTCO's operational capacity to perform the servicesnoted above.\4\\9\<NOTE/> SPNTCO represents that its facilities and personnel are adequateto perform those services in accordance with System Procedures, even duringperiods of extreme market volume and volatility.\5\\0\<NOTE/> Based on this representation and SPNTCO's operating history,the Commission believes that SPNTCO has the operational capacity to performthe above services in a manner consistent with System Procedures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ <T3>See </T3>OCC letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Tom Ford, SPNTCO, to Jonathan Kallman, AssistantDirector, Division, dated December 6, 1988.Delta also has a facilities management agreement with RMJ and RMJ Securities.Under that agreement, RMJ would provide the computer software supportingthe System, while RMJ Securities would provide the computer hardware, datatransmission network, and communication interfaces upon which that softwarewas designed to operate.\5\\1\<NOTE/> RMJ represents that the System's computer software and hardwarefacilities and personnel are adequate to support the System in accordancewith System Procedures.\5\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ RMJ Securities maintains in New York City a primarydata center as well as a back-up data center that provides short and long-termdisaster recovery capabilities. Both facilities utilize 24-hour guard service,continuous videotape surveillance, and alarm service at all points of entry.Both facilities also employ uninterruptible power supplies and extensivefire prevention measures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Steven Lynner, Managing Director, RMJ, to JonathanKallman, Assistant Director, Division, dated December 6, 1988.Delta, SPNTCO, RMJ, and RMJ Securities would be subject to substantialreview regarding their ability to perform their respective System functions.First the internal accounting departments of each entity review the adequacyof their respective systems and controls and report the results of theirreview to their respective Board of Directors. Second, as noted <T3>infra,</T3> internal accounting controls related to Delta and the issuance,clearance, and settlement of System transactions would be reviewed annuallyby an independent public accountant in accordance with Division Standards.RMJ and RMJ Securities also would have independent auditors review theirsystems of internal accounting controls.\5\\3\<NOTE/> Third, each entity would be subject to substantial federalregulation. Delta, as a registered clearing agency, would be subject toCommission oversight as described in Section 17A of the Act and rules thereunder.RMJ and RMJ Securities, as registered government securities brokers underthe Act,\5\\4\<NOTE/> would be required to file annually with the Commission auditedfinancial statements prepared by an independent public accountant and wouldbe subject to periodic Commission examinations.\5\\5\<NOTE/> SPNTCO, as a National Bank and member of the Federal ReserveSystem, is regulated and examined by the Comptroller and FRB.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ <T3>See</T3> 52 FR 27910 (July 24, 1987) and Rule 17a-5 under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ Under section 15c of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78o-5(1988)],government securities brokers and dealers are required to register withthe Commission and meet other requirements applicable to Commission-registeredbrokers and dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ <T3>See</T3> section 15C(d)(1) of the Act.Commentators argue that SPNTCO also should be subject to clearing agencyregistration requirements.\5\\6\<NOTE/> Specifically, they believe that services provided by SPNTCOto Delta constitute clearing agency activities as defined in section 3(A)(23)of the Act and, therefore, trigger registration under section 17A. Commentatorsargue that excluding SPNTCO from clearing agency registration would precludeCommission oversight of SPNTCO's System activities and encourage otherclearing agencies to use facilities management arrangements to avoid Commissionregulation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ <T3>See</T3> CBT, OCC letters.As noted above, SPNTCO would perform a variety of System functions forDelta under a facilities management contract. The Commission recognizesthat SPNTCO would perform a broad range of significant functions includingreceipt, delivery, and safekeeping of securities and funds; \5\\7\<NOTE/> trade matching; monitoring of trading and position limits;acceptance of options; exercise processing; and report preparation anddistribution.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ Commentators do not appear to suggest that these specificfunctions should require SPNTCO to register as a clearing agency. All registeredclearing agencies use arrangements with banks, among other things, to effectmoney settlement, to deliver and receive securities over Fedwire, or forcustody services. To the extent those bank services fall within the section3(a)(23)(A) definition of clearing agency, the Commission believes thatthose activities generally are excluded from the definition of clearingagency under section 3(a)(23)(B) as customary banking activities.The Commission does not believe at this time that the requirements andpurposes of section 17A of the Act require SPNTCO to register with theCommission as a clearing agency. Clearing agencies registered with theCommission \5\\8\<NOTE/> historically have contracted with third parties in orderto provide a variety of clearing agency services.\5\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission's experience with those arrangements is thatthe Commission can carry out its clearing agency oversight responsibilitiesthrough its jurisdiction over the registered clearing agency. Facilitiesmanagers cannot, for example, unilaterally make system changes that wouldalter the rules of the clearing agency (or the rights and obligations ofclearing agency participants)\6\\0\<NOTE/> without having those changes filed by the clearing agencywith the Commission under section 19 of the Act.\6\\1\<NOTE/> The Commission also can access any documentation or informationheld by facilities managers through its jurisdiction over the registeredclearing agency.\6\\2\<NOTE/> To the extent that the Commission needs access to a facilitiesmanager's premises or personnel, the Commission expects, and has found,clearing agencies and facilities managers to be cooperative with Commissionstaff.\6\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ Delta's application raises the question of SPNTCO'sregistration as a clearing agency by virtue of its relationship with Deltaand, thus, this Order does not address whether SPNTCO's System activitiesin the absence of a contractual relationship with a registered clearingagency would require clearing agency registration under section 17A ofthe Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ The Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC''), forexample, operates a Depository Satellite System under which MSTC contractswith third parties to act as subcustodians for bearer-form municipal bonds,including Security Pacific Clearing Services Corporation and Security PacificNational Bank as sub-custodians. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12077 (February6, 1976). The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') has a facilitiesmanagement contract with OCC under which OCC performs the bulk of ICC'sclearing services. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26154 (October 3, 1988),53 FR 39556. A similar arrangement exists between the Government SecuritiesClearing Corporation and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'').<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25740 (May 24, 1988),53 FR 19639. NSCC uses the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (``SIAC'')as a facilities manager to perform certain comprehensive processing functions.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13163 (January13, 1977), 42 FR 3916. The MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBSCC'') began operationswith facilities management arrangements with Midwest Clearing Corporationand Chemical Bank, which included comprehensive computer hardware and softwareservices, operating premises, and personnel. <T3>See </T3>Securities, Exchange Act Release No. 24046 (February 2, 1987),52 FR 4218. <T3>See also </T3>File No. 600-24, under which the Clearing Corporationfor Options and Securities (``CCOS''), a subsidiary of the Chicago Boardof Trade Clearing Corporation (``CBTCC''), seeks registration as a clearingagency including a facilities management arrangement whereby CBTCC wouldperform the bulk of CCOS's processing functions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ <T3>See </T3>section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4. Those provisions define ``rulesof a clearing agency'' broadly to include virtually all material aspectsof clearing agency operations, including by-laws, procedures, services,actions that affect the rights and obligations of the clearing agency orits members, and actions that affect a clearing agency's safeguarding ofsecurities and funds. Indeed, section 19(b) of the Act provides that rulesof a self-regulatory organization cannot be effective unless filed in accordancewith the Act. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24429 (May 6, 1987), inwhich the Commission rendered a decision that a New York Stock Exchangeunwritten policy prohibiting members from installing phone links to communicatewith customers located off the floor had to be filed with the Commissionunder Section 19(b) to be effective.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ The Commission is not aware of any such action thatwas not filed as a rule change under section 19(b). If the Commission werefaced with those circumstances, the Commission, or other appropriate regulatoryagency, would have authority under section 19(h) of the Act to take actionagainst the registered clearing agency.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ Specified information and documentation must be maintainedby a registered clearing agency and made available to Commission staff.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Rule 17a-1 under the Act. <T3>See </T3>the Operating Agreement, Sections 2.7, 4.2, and 4.7 for provisionsdealing with report and recordkeeping responsibilities of Delta, SPNTCO,and RMJ. Nevertheless, RMJ, RMJ Securities, and SPNTCO have agreed to provideaccess to all records and staff as the Commission deems necessary to overseeDelta's financial and operational condition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ Because of that favorable experience and the Commission'sauthority under section 19(h) of the Act, the Commission generally hasnot required that facilities management contracts specifically grant theCommission unlimited access to a facilities manager's premises. If theCommission perceived a need for express authority for such access, it couldformulate an appropriate rule under section 17A (b) and (d) of the Act.The Commission intends to monitor closely the arrangements among Delta,SPNTCO, and RMJ and Delta's compliance with the requirements of the Act.To the extent any actions by entities involved in the System create non-compliancewith the Act or impair the Commission's oversight responsibilities, theCommission believes that the Act authorizes, and the Commission would promptlytake, appropriate action.The Commission emphasizes the unique and critical role that certain facilitiesmanagers provide to self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''). Facilitiesmanagers, for example, may provide the core personnel and equipment necessaryfor SRO operations. Under those circumstances, the facilities manager is,in effect, through its relationship with the SRO, also responsible forthe SRO's satisfaction of its responsibilities under the Act. Moreover,the Commission relies on the SRO and the facilities manager in carryingout its responsibilities under the Act. For those reasons, the Commissionreiterates its willingness to take any appropriate action under the Actin response to activities of facilities managers.\6\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\ Depending on the circumstances and if necessary, theCommission would consider, among other things, suspending or revoking theSRO's registration, imposing limitations on the SRO's activity, and censuringor removing from office officers or directors of the SRO. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>section 19(h) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Internal Accounting Controls</ITAG>The Standards require a clearing agency to furnish annually to participantsan opinion report prepared by its independent public accountant based ona study and evaluation of the clearing agency's system of internal accountingcontrols for the period since the last such report.\65\<NOTE/> The scope of the study and evaluation would include all clearingagency activities performed for participants, particularly trade recording,transaction processing, and depository activities.\66\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ The Standards propose the annual ``for-the-period'' requirementto provide a very high degree of assurance to participants and the Commissionconcerning the safety of overall clearing agency operations. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20221 (September 23, 1983),48 FR 5167 [``Full Registration Order''].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ <T3>Id</T3>.To opine with respect to a clearing agency's system of internal accountingcontrol, the independent accountant would be required to comply with generalstandards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(``AICPA'').\67\<NOTE/> Under AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No.30, the independent accountant's report must, among other things, describeany material weaknesses \68\<NOTE/> in the clearing agency's system of internal accounting controlsand any corrective action taken or proposed to be taken.

Financial Risk Management</ITAG>The Commission believes System Procedures are designed appropriately toprotect System participants and Delta against financial loss associatedwith System services. The principal source of financial risk to Delta andSystem participants is that participants may default on their obligationsto Delta, for example, because of financial insolvency. Delta safeguardsagainst these risks include participation standards, monitoring memberfinancial condition, trading and position limits, MPSE limits, daily marginrequirements, a credit enhancement facility, and specific procedures forhandling the obligations of a defaulting member.\74\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ Delta's safeguards do not include a clearing or participantsfund. <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3>.An Executive Committee of Delta's Board of Directors would determine whetheror not an entity should be admitted as a System participant based on thefollowing criteria.\75\<NOTE/> Entities designated by FRBNY as primary dealers would beeligible for participation. Entities not designated as such would be eligibleif: (1) They are registered with the Commission as brokers or dealers andhave a minimum net capital of $25 million, as calculated in accordancewith the Commission's net capital rule;\78\<NOTE/> or (2) they are registered with the Commission as governmentsecurities brokers or dealers and have a minimum net capital of $25 million,as calculated in accordance with net capital rules promulgated by the Departmentof the Treasury;\77\<NOTE/> or (3) they are commercial banks or insurance companies havinga total equity capitalization of at least $500 million; or (4) they donot fall within the categories described above but meet minimum net capitalrequirements determined by Delta on an individual basis.\78\<NOTE/> To be eligible for participation, entities also must intendto engage in significant trading of Treasury options and must maintainfacilities and personnel adequate for the expeditious and orderly transactionof business within the System.\79\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\One commentator (<T3>see</T3> CBT letters) is concerned that Delta may admit participantsthat would have an unfair advantage in their use of the System becauseof their relationship to Delta or its facilities managers. The Commissionbelieves, however, that specific provisions concerning confidentialityof System information contained in the Operating Agreement and Delta'sprocedures address those concerns. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> section 306 of Delta's procedures. Commentators alsoargue that concerns over potential antitrust liability may induce Deltato admit questionable applicants or refuse to discipline participants violatingSystem Procedures (<T3>see</T3> CBT letters). The Commission believes that this argument isbased on speculation as to future Delta activities and whether or not thoseactivities would result in antitrust liability. <T3>See, generally, Gordon</T3> v. <T3>New York Stock Exchange,</T3> 422 U.S. 659 (1975). Moreover, the Commissionwill continue to oversee Delta activities and respond appropriately toany Delta actions that appear to be inconsistent with the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\<T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 240.15c3-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\The Department of the Treasury has issued financial responsibilityrules, including minimum net capital requirements, for government securitiesbrokers and dealers that are not subject to the Commission's net capitalrule. <T3>See</T3> 52 FR 27910 (July 24, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\One commentator suggested that provisions in Delta's proceduresauthorizing Delta to waive participation criteria are inappropriate. TheCommission, however, believes that flexibility provided by such provisionsenable a clearing agency to respond to unusual or unanticipated circumstanceswhile maintaining prudent standards. The Commission will oversee Deltaand respond appropriately in the event Delta administers such waiver provisionsin a manner inconsistent with the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\Several commentators (<T3>see, e.g.,</T3> CBT letters, CME letter) suggest that Delta's rolein approving applications for Delta membership inappropriately determineswhether an applicant can access RMJ's brokerage services for Treasury options.Those commentators cite section 17A(b)(2)(F), which generally providesthat the rules of a clearing agency not be designed ``to regulate by virtueof any authority conferred by this title matters not related to the purposesof [Section 17A] or the administration of the clearing agency.'' The Commissionbelieves, however, that Delta's admission standards and decisions wouldbe fundamental credit decisions that necessarily must be made by all clearingagencies as part of the safeguarding of securities and funds and administrationof the affairs of the clearing agency. Accordingly, the Commission doesnot believe that those aspects of Delta's operations are designed to regulatematters unrelated to the purposes of section 17A or the administrationof Delta.Once admitted, participants must continue to meet the requirements describedabove and must submit to Delta annual audited financial statements andquarterly unaudited financial statements.\8\\0\<NOTE/> If a participant fails to meet these requirements, Deltamay censure, suspend, or expel the participant, as well as limit the activities,functions, or operations of the participant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\0\ System participants also have a continuing obligationto: (1) Maintain books and records in accordance with System proceduresand, if applicable, Commission rules; (2) employ personnel and utilizeprocedures sufficient to discharge their responsibilities in accordancewith System procedures; (3) not be subject to or be associated with personssubject to a statutory disqualification as defined in section 3(a)(39)of the Act; (4) not engage in or be associated with anyone engaged in actsinconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade; and (5) havesubstantial experience training Treasury options or employ personnel withsuch experience.Delta would impose a limit on the aggregate margin obligations of eachparticipant (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a trading limit) upon admission to the System. This limitwould be based upon the financial capacity of the participant as determinedby Delta credit analysts.\8\\1\<NOTE/> Delta also would impose limits on a participant's aggregatelong or short positions (<T3>i.e.,</T3> position limits) if the condition of the market or the financialor operational condition of a participant made such necessary or advisablefor the protection of Delta or System participants. In imposing positionlimits, Delta could restrict a participant from buying any opening purchasetransaction and/or writing any opening writing transaction or require aparticipant to reduce or eliminate existing long or short positions throughclosing transactions. As noted, neither Delta nor SPNTCO would accept atrade exceeding a participant's trading or position limits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\1\ Specifically, Delta credit analysts would look at aparticipant's balance sheet strengths and weaknesses, amount and trendof earnings, ownership, availability and structure of capital, vulnerabilityto changes in interest rates, and liquidity of assets.System participants would be required to deposit margin daily to secureobligations arising under Treasury options written by them.\8\\2\<NOTE/> The amount of margin required would be derived from two calculations:``mark-to-market'' margin and ``performance'' margin.\8\\3\<NOTE/> Mark-to-market margin represents an estimate of current optionsprices, based upon current implied volatilities of options traded withinthe System,\8\\4\<NOTE/> and the resulting current estimated cost to liquidate a participant'soptions portfolio, <T3>i.e.,</T3> short positions offset by the estimated proceeds from liquidationof its long positions.\8\\5\<NOTE/> Performance margin represents the difference between today'smark-to-market values and the estimated liquidation value of the participant'spositions the next business day \8\\6\<NOTE/> using predicted market movement for the next business daybased on historical volatilities.\8\\7\<NOTE/> In estimating the next-day liquidation value of a participant'spositions, Delta would assume a three standard deviation overnight moveup and down in the value of the Treasury securities underlying those positions.\8\\8\<NOTE/> Delta would reprice options based upon the mark-to-marketvalues and the three standard deviation move in the market. The worst casechange in the value of a participant's positions resulting from these calculationswould be the performance margin requirement. Delta will monitor intra-dayexposure and, under its rules, could require participants to deposit additionalmargin at any time during the business day if it deems such action necessaryor advisable for the protection of Delta or System participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\2\ Margin would be deposited only in the form of FederalReserve funds. In accordance with Delta's instructions, SPNTCO or its affiliatewould invest margin payments in overnight repurchase agreements requiringas collateral the delivery of Treasury bills with maturities not to exceed180 days from the date of such repurchase agreements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\3\ Delta would calculate mark-to-the market and performancemargin on each option position. In calculating performance margin, Deltawill group options into five sectors based on the length to maturity ofthe underlying securities. Delta then nets performance margin (debits orzero) for all sectors; and combines performance margin with the total mark-tomarket margin to generate the participant's margin obligation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\4\ Delta would use implied volatilities generated by TheOption Group (``TOG'') pricing model, which the Commission understandsis utilized by a significant number of primary government securities dealers.Delta would use implied volatilities to price options because individualOTC Treasury options would not necessarily trade regularly and last-saleprices would not be available.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\5\ For margin calculation purposes, Delta would obtaininformation on the prices of underlying Treasury securities by 3:00 p.m.daily from its price vendor, Interactive Data Services Incorporated (``IDSI'').If, after 3:00 p.m., the market moves significantly, Delta would substitutefor those prices 5:00 p.m. prices obtained from two participant dealersselected at random.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\6\ Performance margin also would be calculated using theTOG pricing model. RMJ would provide the software and data processing forthe model. Margin parameters for options priced by the model would be establishedby Delta.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\7\ Delta would use a 100-day moving average based uponprice observations of underlying Treasury securities during the immediatelyprior 100 days.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\8\ Delta states in its application that a three standarddeviation confidence interval provides a 99.1% level of confidence (<T3>i.e.,</T3> 99.1% of all price changes should fall within that interval).Delta would obtain and maintain a $200 million credit enhancement facilitydesigned to ensure that Delta would be able to satisfy its obligationsif margin deposits were insufficient to cover a default. Security PacificNational Bank (``SPNB'') has agreed to issue, for the benefit of Delta,a letter of credit in the amount of $100 million.\8\\9\<NOTE/> If a participant defaults, and Delta's default proceduresdo not produce funds sufficient to cover that participant's obligations,Delta would draw on the letter of credit to cover those obligations.\9\\0\<NOTE/> Should the letter of credit amount be insufficient to covera participant default, Delta could draw on a $100 milion surety bond \9\\1\<NOTE/> issued by Capital Markets Assurance Corporation (``CapMAC'').\9\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ SPNB, a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corporation,is the eighth largest commercial bank in the United States with reportedassets of approximately $47.2 billion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ To make a draw on the letter of credit, Delta wouldpresent to SPNB a sight draft and a certificate for payment. If these documentsare presented in conformity with the letter of credit prior to 2:00 p.m.(all times refer to Eastern Standard Time) on a particular business day,SPNB would honor the demand in accordance with Delta's payment instructionsby 3:00 p.m. on the same business day. If a demand is made after 2:00 p.m.,SPNB would honor the demand by 2:00 p.m. the following business day.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ The maximum coverage for any participant under thesurety bond would be $20 million.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ CapMAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citibank (NewYork State) engaged in the business of financial guarantee and surety insurance.If CapMAC receives Delta's demand for payment in conformity with the termsof the surety bond, at or prior to 2:00 p.m. (all times refer to EasternTime) on a particular business day, CapMAC would make funds available toDelta in accordance with its payment instructions by 3:00 p.m. that samebusiness day. If a demand is made after 2:00 p.m., CapMAC would make fundsavailable to Delta by 2:00 p.m. the next business day.Each participant must be accepted by SPNB as an account party on the letterof credit and must be accepted by CapMAC as an insured party under thesurety bond.\9\\3\<NOTE/> Furthermore, each participant must reimburse SPNB and CapMACfor any draws made on the letter of credit or surety bond because of thatparticipant's default. SPNB would bear the risk of loss for all reimburseddraws under the letter of credit up to $50 million. Loss from unreimburseddraws under the letter of credit in excess of $50 million would be borneby both SPNB and Delta, and all unreimbursed draws under the surety bondwould be borne by both CapMAC and Delta.\9\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ If a participant is terminated as an account partyon the letter of credit or as an insured party under the surety bond, itwould be suspended from the System.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ Delta's proportionate share of the unreimbursed drawsshall be determined by multiplying the amount of the unreimbursed drawsunder the letter of credit in excess of $50 million or the amount of theunreimbursed payments under the surety bond, as the case may be, by a fraction,the numerator of which equals $5 million and the denominator of which equalsthe aggregate face amount of the credit enhancement facility minus $45million. Accordingly, assuming the amount of unreimbursed draws under theletter of credit is $75 million, Delta's proportionate share of the lossin excess of the $50 million limit would be 81%: $25 million (amount ofunreimbursed draws in excess of $50 million) andmultiply; $5 million/$155millionThe amount available to be paid to Delta pursuant to the credit enhancementfacility would at all times equal at least three times MPSE. MPSE wouldequal (1) the exposure of all participant short positions adjusted to reflecta six standard deviation \9\\5\<NOTE/> move in the price of Treasury securities underlying thosepositions, less the sum of (2) the value of all participant long positionsadjusted to reflect the same movement, the amount of margin on depositfrom all participants, and the amount of margin due from all participantsat or before the immediately succeeding settlement time. At the close ofeach business day, MPSE would be calculated for the entire System and foreach participant. To ensure that the credit enhancement facility exceedsat least three times MPSE, Delta would be permitted to impose positionlimits on participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ The standard deviation would be derived from the greaterof (1) the average market price, based on trading prices during a periodof 100 consecutive trading days ending on February 19, 1980, (the periodof highest volatility in Treasury securities prices in recent history)of Treasury securities which are equivalent to Treasury securities underlyingsuch short positions or (2) the average market price of similar Treasurysecurities during any subsequent period of 100 consecutive trading days(a period of even higher volatility).Accordingly to one commentator,\9\\6\<NOTE/> CapMAC and SPNB perform functions that should require themto register as clearing agencies. Specifically, the commentator believesthat SPNB and CapMAC would have the authority to (1) make admission orsuspension decisions, (2) approve or disapprove Delta's proposed rule changes,(3) monitor participant compliance with System Procedures, and (4) requireparticipants to post additional margin.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ <T3>See</T3> CBT letters.The Commission believes that for the following reasons the above characterizationsare inaccurate. First, although participant admission and continued participationin the System are contingent upon being an account party on SPNB's letterof credit and an insured party under CapMAC's surety bond, any denial ofadmission or suspension for a failure to meet that criteria would be madeby Delta, not CapMAC or SPNB. Second, although Delta has agreed not toamend System Procedures in a manner adversely affecting the credit enhancementfacility without the facility's consent,\9\\7\<NOTE/> SPNB and CapMAC would not have the authority, generally,to approve or disapprove Delta's proposed rule changes. Third, althoughSPNB and CapMAC may monitor the financial condition of a participant todetermine whether or not it should remain an account party on the letterof credit or an insured party under the surety bond, they would not monitorparticipant compliance with System Procedures. Also, it is legitimate tolook to credit evaluations by third parties in making credit decisions,without thereby rendering those parties ``clearing agencies'' who mustalso register under section 17A of the Act. Finally, although CapMAC andSPNB may request that Delta impose intra-day variation margin requirementsupon participants, they have no right to require participants to post margin.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ This condition is similar to that contained in Section4.5 of the Credit and Security Agreement between OCC and Citibank N.A.,in which Citibank N.A. has the right to review proposed rule changes filedby OCC with the Commission. <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-OCC-86-25 (Exhibit 1).The Commission does not believe that the rights of CapMAC and SPNB describedabove trigger the section 17A clearing agency registration requirement.\9\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission, however, intends to monitor closely arrangementsamong Delta, SPNB, and CapMAC, and Delta's compliance with the requirementsof the Act. To the extent any actions by those entities create noncompliancewith the Act or impair the Commission's oversight responsibilities, theCommission believes that the Act authorizes, and the Commission promptlywould take, appropriate action.\9\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\  SPNB and CapMAC's role in the Delta System may beanalogous, in some respects, to the role of settlement banks in The DepositoryTrust Company's (``DTC'') same-day funds settlement system. DTC's rulesfor the same-day funds settlement system require banks acting as settlementagents for DTC participants using that system to establish a maximum creditlimit for their client DTC participants. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26051 (August 31, 1988),53 FR 34853.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ As previously noted, depending on the circumstances,and if necessary, the Commission would consider, among other things, suspendingor revoking Delta's registration, imposing limitations on Delta's activity,and censuring or removing from office officers and directors of Delta.<T3>See, e.g.,</T3> section 19(h) of the Act.Delta may suspend summarily any participant that defaults on its Systemobligations.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> Upon suspension, a participant would no longer be permittedto trade through the System, and Delta would place all margin and otherproperty deposited by such participant in a liquidating settlement account(``LSA''). Pending transactions of a suspended participant (<T3>i.e., </T3>transactions where acceptance by SPNTCO is pending at thetime of suspension) would be rejected by SPNTCO, and Delta would closeout that participant's long positions, short positions, and exercised options.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> Proceeds from the closing of all long positions and exercisedoptions would be credited to LSA, while expenses incurred in closing shortpositions and exercised options would be charged to LSA.\1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> If the cost of liquidating a suspended participant's positionsexceeds the amount available in LSA, Delta would make a draw on the creditenhancement facility in the manner previously described.\1\\0\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ Under System procedures, summary suspension is mandatoryif a participant has committed a premium, margin, payment, or deliverydefault, provided that such suspension may be deferred (1) not more thantwo hours in the event of a premium or margin default, and (2) not morethan 24 hours in the event of a delivery or payment default. Delta, inits discretion, may suspend a participant that: (1) Is in financial oroperating difficulty; (2) is insolvent; (3) has been suspended by a self-regulatoryorganization; or (4) is the subject of an order withdrawing, suspending,or revoking any license, membership, or other qualification necessary todo business.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ Under System procedures, Delta may liquidate a defaultingparticipant's positions selectively or may offer the whole position, inclusiveof all outstanding option series, to a limited number of participants forcompetitive bidding. The participant offering the lowest net liquidationcost to Delta would assume the entire position.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ If a suspended participant has failed to deliversecurities pursuant to its exercise settlement obligations, Delta wouldbuy-in Treasury securities for the account and liability of the defaultingparticipant, using LSA funds for such buy-in. If a suspended participanthas failed to receive and pay for securities pursuant to its exercise settlementobligations, Delta would sell the securities tendered by the deliveringparticipant and pay the delivering participant with the proceeds from thatsale and any additional amount that must be withdrawn from LSA to meetthe defaulting participant's obligations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\3\ Within one hour of being notified of suspension,a participant would be required to pay the debt balance in LSA resultingfrom the liquidation of the participant's positions and exercised optioncontracts.The Commission notes that Delta's clearing system does not include a clearingfund as contemplated by the Standards Release.\1\\0\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission also notes that Delta's system representsthe first Commission-approved clearing system that does not mutualize riskamong clearing agency participants.\1\\0\\5\<NOTE/> Although other clearing agencies registered with the Commissionemploy some form of risk mutualization, the Commission does not believethat risk mutualization is mandated by the provisions of the Act. Riskmutualization has certain benefits, including the provision of liquidityfrom within the clearing agency environment that otherwise must be providedby outside sources. The Commission will examine each clearing agency applicanton a case-by-case basis to determine whether its risk management proceduresare appropriately tailored to the markets served by the clearing agencyand otherwise satisfy the requirements of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\4\ The Standards state that ``[t]he Divison believesthat it is appropriate for a clearing agency to establish by rule an appropriatelevel of clearing fund contributions based, among other things, on itsassessment of the risks to which it is subject.'' <T3>See </T3>Standards Release, 20 SEC Docket at 432. Clearing funds mayprovide, among other things, a defense against financial loss due to participantdefaults; a ready source of liquid funds in that event; and a vehicle tofacilitate risk mutualization among participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\5\ <T3>But see </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24046 (February 2,1987), 52 FR 4218, concerning temporary registration of the MBS ClearingCorporation (``MBSCC'') as a clearing agency. MBSCC's risk management systememploys a limited mutualization of risk among participants by limitingits ultimate capability to assess participants to those participants thathad MBSCC transactions with a defaulting participant.The Commission believes at this time that Delta's credit analysis, participantmonitoring, margin requirements, credit enhancement facilities, and systemdebit caps \1\\0\\6\<NOTE/> implemented through MPSE limits \1\\0\\7\<NOTE/> provide sufficient safeguards and liquidity for the Commissionto conclude that Delta's system should be permitted to begin operations.In the event of an unanticipated default, Delta will reply initially onthe defaulting participant's margin deposits and then access Delta's creditenhancement facilities for up to $200 million. The Commission believesthat margin requirements for derivative product clearing systems functionin a manner similar to clearing fund contributions for stock clearing systems.\1\\0\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\6\ Delta's MPSE caps distinguish its system from stockand option clearing systems operated by NSCC and OCC where the clearingagencies must guarantee the settlement of virtually unlimited trading activity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\7\ Delta also would apply a limit on the amount ofrisk each participant could pose to the System by limiting the amount ofmargin each participant posts with the System. Delta would not accept transactionsthat would exceed that limit and, to the extent market movements createexposure from a participant that exceeds its limit, Delta would requirethe participant to enter closing transactions that would reduce marginto below the participant's limit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\8\ OCC, for example, relies heavily on its margin systemas a primary risk management procedure, supplemented by a clearing fund.OCC, however, does not maintain credit enhancement facilities such as thoseemployed by Delta. Moreover, Delta does not mutualize default risk amongall participants through participant assessment capability as do OCC andNational Securities Clearing Corporation. In the Delta system, like OCC'ssystem, margin deposits on an individual participant are available onlyin the event that participant defaults.The commentator \1\\0\\9\<NOTE/> expressed concern about Delta's plan to admit federally-insuredcommercial banks as participants in Delta's options system. This commentatornoted that a commercial bank insolvency would be governed by federal orstate banking laws, rather than the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (``Code'')as amended. Thus, according to this commentator, Delta may not have certainprotections against bank member insolvency because it cannot benefit fromrecent amendments to the Code clarifying the right of clearing agenciesto close out open obligations of insolvent clearing members and to applymargin payments consistent with statutory provisions concerning automaticstays, voidable preferences and fraudulent transfers.\1\\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\9\ <T3>See </T3>OCC letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\0\ In support of these concerns, the commentator cited<T3>Brill v. </T3><T3>Citizens Trust Co., </T3>492 A.2d 1215 (R.I. 1985), which apparentlyprecluded a post-petition bank acceleration of an unmatured, unsecuredobligation involving a non-bank debtor. Although not dispositive of theseconcerns, the Commission notes that <T3>Brill </T3>may be distinguishable from the kind of case that mightresult from Delta's decision to admit commercial banks as participants.Among other things, the bank in <T3>Brill </T3>was an unsecured creditor. As discussed below, Delta willmaintain appropriate liens, and will perfect its security interest in margin,long options issued to its members, and other assets held on behalf ofits members.The Commission believes that Delta has taken appropriate precautions toprotect against losses resulting from a participating bank's insolvency.First, Delta will maintain a lien over all options in participant accounts,as well as assets participants deposit to meet Delta's margin requirements,and expects to meet all state commercial law requirements necessary fora perfected security interest in those assets.\1\\1\\1\<NOTE/> Second, Delta's rules concerning the close-out of open positionsin the event of participant default appear to satisfy commercial law standardsfor reasonable disposition of assets. Third, the close-out of a defaultingparticipant's open options position would appear to satisfy the requirementsfor debtor set-off under federal banking law applicable to national bankinsolvencies.\1\\1\\2\<NOTE/> Finally, Delta expects to monitor participant financial conditionclosely, with the expectation that any action necessary to address memberfinancial or operational difficulties could be taken in advance of formalinsolvency or receivership proceedings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\1\ Delta expects its options will be treated as uncertificatedsecurities under the New York Uniform Commercial Code. <T3>See </T3>N.Y. U.C.C. 8-102 (McKinney 1988). Under New York law, acceptablemethods of perfecting a security interest in uncertificated securitiesinclude making appropriate entries on the books of a clearing corporationor registering the security interest on the books of the issuer. <T3>See id., </T3>UCC 8-320, 8-313. These methods may not be sufficientto obtain a perfected security interest in all states, however, becausesome state commercial laws treat uncertificated securities as ``generalintangibles,'' and require creditors to file financing statements at centraloffices to ``perfect'' security interests against the claims of other creditors.Delta has represented that it will take all reasonable steps necessaryto assure it maintains a perfected security interest in assets securingparticipant payment obligations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\2\ National bank insolvencies are governed by federalbanking law. <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 91, 94. The allowance of claims against the assetsof an insolvent national bank is a matter of federal law. <T3>See, e.g., FDIC v. </T3><T3>Mademoiselle of California, </T3>379 F.2d 660, 662 (9th Cir. 1967).The validity of setoff claims must comport with federal law, although courtshave at times looked to state law for guiding principles. <T3>See Interfirst Bank Abilene </T3>v. <T3>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, </T3>777 F.2d 1092, 1094 (5thCir. 1985). Courts have looked to ``general equitable doctrines,'' andstate law for principles underlying the right of setoff. <T3>See FDIC </T3>v. <T3>Liberty Nat. Bank andamp; Trust Co., </T3>806 F.2d 961 (10th Cir. 1986).Among the states recognizing set-off rights are California, New York, Oklahomaand Pennsylvania. <T3>See, e.g., Yardley </T3>v. <T3>Philler, </T3>167 U.S. 344 (1896) (PA); 806 F.2d 961 (OK); 379 F.2d660 (CA); <T3>Savings Bank of Rockland Conty </T3>v. <T3>FDIC, </T3>668 F.Supp. 799 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (NY).<ITAG tagnum="28">Although the ability to setoff claims against an insolvent participantlikely will depend on the particular circumstances surrounding that insolvency,Delta appears justified in its reliance on an ability to setoff its claimsagainst a participant as one of many protections against financial lossassociated with accepting national banks as participants.

Standard of Care</ITAG>The Commission believes that clearing agencies should perform their functionsunder a high standard of care, and at a minimum perform custody functionsunder an ordinary negligence standard of care.\113\<NOTE/> Delta and its facilities managers would perform their Systemfunctions under an ordinary negligence standard of care, with Delta assumingliability for a breach of that standard by any of those entities.\114\<NOTE/> Delta would be able to seek indemnification or contributionfrom its facilities managers for their role in a standard-of-care breach.\115\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ <T3>See </T3>Standards Release, Full Registration Order; Securities ExchangeAct Release Nos. 24046 (February 5, 1987), 52 FR 4218; 25740 (May 24, 1988),53 FR 19639; and 26154 (October 3, 1988), 53 FR 39556. The Commission alsobelieves that a lower standard of care may be appropriate for certain non-custodialfunctions that, consistent with minimizing risk mutualization, a clearingagency, its Board of Directors, and its members determine to allocate toindividual service users. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 25740 (May 24, 1988),53 FR 19639; and 26154 (October 3, 1988), 53 FR 39556. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ <T3>See </T3>Section 1501(b) of the System Procedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ <T3>See </T3>Section 6 of the Operating Agreement.The Standards Release provides that the rules of a clearing agency, subjectto several exceptions, must require the clearing agency to promptly deliversecurities in its custody or control to, or as directed by, the Participantfor whom they are held.\116\<NOTE/> The Standards except from that requirement securities deliveredagainst payment (for which the Participant has not made payment) and securitiespledged by the Participant through the clearing agency. The Standards Releasealso requires that a clearing agency's rules and agreements enable broker-dealersto comply with applicable provisions of the Act and related Commissionrules concerning protection of customer assets, such as sections 8 and15 of the Act and Rules 8c-1, 15c2-1, and 15c3-3 under the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ <T3>See </T3>Standards Release, <T3>supra, </T3>note 31.In this regard, the Commission notes that the System was designed for proprietaryactivity and that Delta would maintain liens over all Delta-issued options.Thus, Delta's procedures do not provide for lien-free accounts to enableparticipants to comply with the Commission's customer protection rules.Delta's rules accordingly specifically prohibit its participants from usingthe System to establish or maintain customer positions in Delta-issuedoptions. The Commission believes that the proprietary nature of the System and Delta'srules that prohibit customer-related activity indicate that those provisionsof the Standard Release concerning customer protection procedures shouldnot be applied to Delta. The Commission, however, emphasizes that Deltais obligated by the Act to enforce all of its rules, including the rulerequiring System users to limit their activity to proprietary trading.D. Other Determinations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Capacity to Comply With the Act and Enforce Compliance by Membersand Participants</ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that Delta have the capacity tocomply with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.Commission rules require Delta to keep and preserve certain records,\117\<NOTE/> obtain and retain fingerprints from personnel,\118\<NOTE/> and register and participate in the Commission's Lost andStolen Securities Program.\119\<NOTE/> Based upon a review of System Procedures and Delta's facilitiesmanagement arrangements, the Commission believes Delta has the capacityto comply with the Act and rules thereunder. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ Rule 17a-1 (17 CFR 240.17a-1 (1988)) requires a registeredclearing agency to keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents,including correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts,and other records, as are made or received by it in the course of its business.As registered government securities brokers, RMJ and RMJ Securities wouldbe subject to similar recordkeeping requirements under Rule 17a-3 (17 CFR240.17a-3 (1988) and Rule 17a-4 (17 CFR 240.17a-4 (1988)). SPNTCO is subjectto similar requirements under federal banking regulations. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 205 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ Rule 17f-2 (17 CFR 240.17f-2 (1988)) requires a registeredclearing agency to obtain and maintain a record of fingerprints of eachof its directors, officers, and employees who do not qualify for an exemptionfrom fingerprinting contained within the rule. A copy of each set of fingerprintsalso must be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As registeredgovernment securities brokers, RMJ and RMJ Securities would be subjectto this Rule 17f-2 requirement. SPNTCO is subject to a similar requirementunder federal banking laws. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ Rule 17f-1 (17 CFR 240.17f-1 (1988)) requires a registeredclearing agency to register and participate in the Lost and Stolen SecuritiesProgram (``Program''). Under the Program, a participant is required toreport the discovery of a theft or loss of a security and to inquire withrespect to certain securities which come into its possession whether thesecurity has been reported lost, missing, or stolen. As registered governmentsecurities brokers, RMJ and RMJ Securities would be required to registerin the Program. As a member of the Federal Reserve System SPNTCO is registeredin the Program. Commentators argue that Delta's registration would contravene that portionof section 17A(B)(3)(A) requiring a registered clearing agency to be organizedand have the capacity to comply with the Act.\120\<NOTE/> Specifically, they argue that the System would operate asan unregistered exchange in violation of sections 5 and 6 of the Act, andthat Delta would be an aider and abettor to those violations. As notedabove, the Division believes that, at this time, the System is not requiredto register as an exchange.\121\<NOTE/> Based upon that determination, the Commission believes Delta'srole in the formation and administration of the System will not impairDelta's capacity to comply with the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See </T3>CBT and CME letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from Richard Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, to Robert A. McTamaney, Esq., Carter, Ledyard andamp; Milburn,dated January 12, 1989. Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act also requires Delta to have the capacityto enforce participant compliance with System Procedures.\122\<NOTE/> System Procedures must provide Delta with the authority andability to discipline participants via appropriate sanctions \123\<NOTE/> and must provide fair procedures for the imposition of suchsanctions.\124\<NOTE/> as discussed below, System Procedures contain appropriatesanctions and provide Delta the authority to impose such sanctions in anequitable manner. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\ Several commentators state that the Delta applicationfails to demonstrate that Delta is so organized and has the capacity tobe able to enforce its rules as required by section 17A(b)(3)(A). <T3>See, e.g., </T3>OCC and CBT letters. The Commission believes Delta'sorganization satisfies that requirement. Delta's procedures, for example,require all Delta participants to comply with Delta's rules as a conditionto continued participation in Delta. Furthermore, Delta has instructedSPNTCO to advise Delta of all participant delivery or payment delays, bothof which constitute violations of Delta's rules. Moreover, Delta's rulesprovide specific sanctions and disciplinary procedures for violations ofDelta's rules. Although Delta does not have an operating history, the Commissionwill oversee Delta's operations and take appropriate action in the eventany evidence emerges that Delta is unable or unwilling to enforce its rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\ <T3>See </T3>section 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ <T3>See </T3>section 17A(b)(3)(H) of the Act. Delta may fine, suspend, or limit the activities of any participant forviolations of System Procedures. Prior to the imposition of such sanctions,Delta would furnish the affected participant with written notice of chargesand would give that participant an opportunity to have its claim heardbefore an Executive Committee of Delta's Board of Directors.\125\<NOTE/> All Executive Committee decisions would be in writing andwould be appealable to Delta's Board of Directors, who could affirm, reverse,or modify the decision.\126\<NOTE/> Under section 19(d)(2) of the Act, a disciplined participantcould appeal a final decision of the Executive Committee or Delta's Boardof Directors to the Commission, which could affirm or reverse that decisionpursuant to section 19(f) of the Act.\127\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ Participants subject to summary suspension would receivenotice of that suspension after it has been imposed but would be able toappeal that suspension to the Executive Committee.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ Any decision by the Executive Committee to affirm asummary suspension would be appealable to the Board of Directors as ofright, but any Executive Committee decision not involving summary suspensionwould be appealable only at the discretion of the Board of Directors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ Under section 19(f), the Commission could affirm a sanctionimposed by Delta if: (1) The grounds on which the sanction is based existin fact; (2) the sanction is in accordance with System Procedures; and(3) those procedures are and were applied in a manner consistent with theAct. The Commission could reverse any sanctions not meeting the conditionsdescribed above or any sanction imposing any burden on competition notnecessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Personsadversely affected by Commission decisions under section 19 of the Actalso can obtain review of those decisions in a U.S. Court of Appeals undersection 25(b)(1) of the Act. One commentator believes that System Procedures do not provide proceduraldue process for disciplined participants in a manner consistent with sections17A(b)(3)(G) and 17A(b)(3)(H) of the Act, because, according to that commentator,SPNB and CapMAC would be able to suspend participants or deny admissionwithout being required to afford them procedural due process.\128\<NOTE/> The Commission disagrees for several reasons. First, althougha participants' admission and continued participation in the System arecontingent upon it being an account party on SPNB's letter of credit andan insured party under CapMAC's surety bond, Delta would make any admissionor suspension decision for a failure to meet that criteria, and due processprocedures described in the System Procedures would apply. Second, in theevent an applicant presents a letter of credit or surety bond from an unaffiliatedentity other than SPNB or CapMAC, and if such letter of credit or suretybond is (i) in an amount equal to Delta's existing credit enhancement facility;\129\<NOTE/> and (ii) otherwise comparable (including the credit ratingof the issuer) to Delta's existing credit enhancement facility, Delta hasrepresented to the Commission that it will consider promptly the acceptanceof such letter of credit or surety and, if it decides to accept such letterof credit or surety, promptly will take all necessary steps to implementthat decision. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ <T3>See </T3>CBT letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ The Commission notes that this credit enhancement facilitywould provide as much as $200 million to cover losses arising from defaultsby one or more participants.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Fair Representation</ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that a clearing agency's rulesassure fair representation to its participants and shareholders in theselection of its directors and administration of its affairs. The Act doesnot define the term fair representation or establish particular standardsof representation. Instead, it provides that the Commission must determineon a case-by-case basis whether the rules of the clearing agency regardingthe manner in which decisions are made provide fair representation to participantsand shareholders.\130\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ <T3>See </T3>Standards Release and Full Registration Order.The Commission believes Delta's governance procedures provide fair representationto participants in the administration of Delta's affairs. According tothe Standards Release, one aspect of the fair representation requirementcan be satisfied when a clearing agency has a participant advisory committeethat has a meaningful opportunity to influence decisions made by the clearingagency's Board of Directors.\131\<NOTE/> Under System Procedures, a committee of 5 to 15 participants(``Participants' Committee'') will advise Delta's Board of Directors onmatters pertaining to the operation of the System.\132\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ <T3>See </T3>Standards Release.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ The Participants' Committee will be selected by Delta'sBoard of Directors and will act in an advisory capacity only (<T3>i.e., </T3>Delta will not bound by any advice or recommendation ofthe Participants' Committee).Although Delta governance procedures provide for the Participants' Committee,commentators \133\<NOTE/> argue that those procedures do not provide participants fairrepresentation in the selection of Delta's Board because Delta's Boardwould be selected solely by Delta shareholders with no input from Systemparticipants.\134\<NOTE/> In contrast, Delta argues that its Board selection processis appropriate, because Delta shareholders rather than System participantsassume the full business risks of owning and operating the company.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ See OCC, Amex, and CBT letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ The number of directors would be fixed from time totime by the Board at no less than one nor more than thirteen. Directorswould be elected by Delta shareholders at their annual meeting to serveone-year terms.Because Delta governance procedures are not consistent with that portionof section 17A(b)(3)(C) requiring fair representation to participants inthe selection of a clearing agency's directors, Delta has requested anexemption from that requirement. In adopting GSA, Congress cited section17A(b)(3)(C) as a requirement in which the Commission should recognizedistinctions between proprietary and membership clearing agencies and shouldexercise its discretionary authority to interpret and adapt that requirement,where appropriate, to proprietary clearing agencies.\135\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ <T3>See </T3>132 Cong. Rec. S15798 (October 9, 1987).The Commission believes that it is appropriate to grant Delta an exemptionfrom section 17A(b)(3)(C). Unlike other registered clearing agencies, Deltalikely will not serve as the sole or central clearing facility for anyparticular market or identifiable group of market participants. Similarly,Delta will not mutualize among participants, through a clearing fund orthrough direct assessments, risks of loss associated with participant defaultsor system losses. In the market for OTC Treasury options, Delta, RMJ, andSPNTCO will represent one of numerous trading and clearing system alternatives.Moreover, securities options and futures exchanges and clearinghouses alsowill be available to market participants that trade in derivative productsoverlying Treasury securities. The Commission also notes that the DeltaSystem does not have an operating history and that the composition of Delta'sparticipants and System trading volume are unknown at this time. For thosereasons, the Commission believes that an exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C)is appropriate at this time. Before granting Delta full registration asa clearing agency, however, the Commission plans to re-evaluate Delta'sgovernance structure in light of the System's operating history. If atthe end of the temporary registration period the Commission believes changedcircumstances indicate that Delta should no longer receive a partial exemptionfrom section 17A(b)(3)(C), the Commission will modify or terminate thatexemption.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Competition</ITAG>Section 17A of the Act directs the Commission to have due regard for themaintenance of fair competition among brokers, dealers, clearing agencies,and transfer agents. Section 17A(b)(3)(I) provides that a clearing agency'srules may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriatein furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As discussed below, the Commissionbelieves the System Procedures and Delta's registration as a clearing agencywould not impose any inappropriate burdens on competition and indeed shouldpromote increased competition.The Commission believes that Delta's registration will promote increasedcompetition in the Treasury options market. Specifically, the Commissionbelieves that Delta, in conjunction with its facilities managers, can makeefficient, automated processing available to a wider universe of institutionsby decreasing the need for each institution to develop its own in-houseprocessing systems, hire personnel, and incur other expenses associatedwith transaction processing. With these efficiencies, dealers and otherinvestors may be more inclined to trade OTC Treasury options as an alternativemethod to hedge portfolio risk or discover price movements in the market.Moreover, the assurance of Delta's guarantee of performance regarding allSystem options may permit fuller participation of some relatively smallerdealers in the OTC government securities options market. Consistent withsection 17A(b)(3)(B), System Procedures provide that a wide variety offinancial institutions may apply for System participation provided thatthey satisfy applicable financial responsibility standards as contemplatedby section 17A(b)(4)(B).The Commission believes that Delta's registration will not result in anyinappropriate burden on competition among banks or other entities providingclearing services. Banks and other entities providing clearing servicescan participate in the System and likely will continue to perform settlementservices outside the System for government securities brokers and dealers.To the contrary, the Commission believes that approval of this applicationwill, in accordance with Congressional intent, promote additional competitionamong organizations providing clearing services, all to the benefit ofinvestors and the marketplace.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Fees</ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3) of the Act requires a clearing agency's rules to allocateequitably among participants reasonable fees, dues, and other charges.That section also provides that clearing agency rules not impose any scheduleof prices or fix rates for services rendered by participants. As describedbelow, the Commission believes the System Procedures and fees are consistentwith these provisions.System participants will be charged transaction-based fees for both theuse of the brokerage service provided by RMJ and the use of the clearingservice arranged by Delta through SPNTCO. Each party to a transaction brokeredby RMJ on a blind basis will be charged both a brokerage commission anda clearing fee. Each party to a transaction effected on a fully disclosedbasis without the use of RMJ brokerage services will be charged by Deltaa clearing fee only. Brokerage commissions and clearing fees assessed againstparticipants would be collected by Delta.The Commission has reviewed Delta's proposed fees and found them to applyequally to all participants. Furthermore, the Commission believes SystemProcedures do not in any manner impose prices or fix rates for servicesprovided by participants. Therefore, the Commission believes that Delta'sfees are consistent with section 17A(b)(3) of the Act. Delta will be requiredto file changes to its fees with the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)and Rule 19b-4 under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Delta's ``Rules of the Clearing Agency'' Interpretation Request</ITAG>Delta has requested an interpretation from the Commission concerning thephrase ``rules of the clearing agency'' and associated filing requirementsunder section 19(b) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\136\<NOTE/> Several commentators \137\<NOTE/> oppose the request and argue that such an interpretationwill place significant aspects of the System outside Commission oversightand will disadvantage other self-regulatory organizations subject to amore expansive interpretation of the phrase. Nevertheless, Delta believesthat its requested interpretation is appropriate in the context of a proprietaryclearing agency that is not owned or controlled by its participants. Deltaalso believes that the interpretation will apply only to very limited subjectmatters and potential changes in Delta's governance structure, and willnot affect System operations or Delta participants. In that context, theCommission notes that the Division has issued a no-action letter relatedto Delta's request subject to modification or revocation at any time asnecessary to further the purposes of the Act.\138\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ Specifically, Delta requests an interpretation thatwould exclude from the filing requirements of section 19(b) changes toDelta's corporate governance documents (<T3>e.g.,</T3> Delta's articles of incorporation, and corporate by-lawsthat do not affect Delta's participants or the safeguarding of securitiesand funds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\<T3> See, e.g.,</T3> OCC and CBT letters.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division,to William Lynch, Gaston andamp; Snow, counsel for Delta, dated January 12,1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusions and Determinations</ITAG>The Commission has reviewed Delta's application for registration as a clearingagency pursuant to sections 17A(b) and 19(a)(1) of the Act. The Commissionalso has reviewed Delta's request for an exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C)of the Act.After reviewing Delta's application for registration, the Commission hasdetermined that Delta is organized and has the capacity to facilitate theprompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions;safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which itis responsible; comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules andregulations thereunder; enforce compliance by its participants with SystemProcedures; and carry out the purposes of section 17A of the Act. The Commissionalso has determined that System Procedures are designed to promote promptand accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions; assurethe safeguarding of securities and funds that are in the custody or controlof Delta or for which it is responsible; foster cooperation and coordinationwith persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions;prevent unfair discrimination in the admission of participants or amongparticipants in the use of Delta; and, in general, protect investors andthe public interest. In addition, the Commission has determined that SystemProcedures provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees,and other charges among participants; do not impose any schedule of prices,or fix rates or other fees for services rendered by participants; providefor appropriate discipline of participants for a violation of any provisionof System Procedures by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities,fines, censure, or any other fitting sanction. They also provide a fairprocedure with respect to the disciplining of participants, the denialof participation to applicants, and the prohibition or limitation by Deltaof any person with respect to access to System services; and do not imposeany burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance ofthe purposes of the Act.The Commission has granted Delta a partial exemption from section 17A(b)(3)(C)of the Act. The Commission finds that granting the above exemption requestis consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, andthe purposes of section 17A, including the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions as well as the safeguarding ofsecurities and funds.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to sections 17A(b)(2) and 19(a) of theAct, that Delta's registration be and it hereby is granted for a periodof 36 months from the date of this Order, and that Delta be granted theexemptions described above subject to the terms, exemption, and other qualificationscontained in this Order.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 12, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
