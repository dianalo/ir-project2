 But for many, the thrill is gone.andP;  DDE ishard to learn, and seems oriented toward one particular use, a spreadsheet(Excel) calling out to Lotus' Signal product for a realtime stock quote.andO;This is because such routines require an understanding of Excel's BinaryInformation File (BIF) format and the only place BIF is documented is in theExcel Developer's kit.andP;  But even if DDE began as a proprietary protocol, isit useful enough to expand into an industry standard?andM;To get an idea of the problems Windows developers face we spoke to Jim Evansand Alan Cooper (see following items below).andP;  Both expressed somewhatnegative opinions.andP;  Then, we interviewed Stan Levine, vice president for Randamp;Dat Automated Design Systems extensively.andP;  Stan did a superb job ofpinpointing DDE's shortcomings on a network.andM;To be fair, not everyone we spoke to knocked DDE.andP;  Lotus Development Corp.'sRichard Wolf told us he likes DDE, and the official title for Microsoft'sin-house DDE guru Viktor Grabner these days is 'Evangelist.&quot;andP;  But before youaccuse us of DDE-bashing remember this protocol has been treated like asacred cow in Windows circles...until now.andM;&quot;DDE has got to be the most bizarre thing Microsoft ever invented,&quot; JimEvans, vice president of ETN Corporation (Dallas) told us.andP;  It is sounderspecified that Evans and his associates spent months getting it right.andO;Then, deciding his hard-won knowledge ought to be worth something, Evansconceived ETN's first product--dde/XPress--a program that moves data intoExcel's Binary Information File (BIF), Rich Text (RTF) or Comma SeparatedVariable formats.andP;  How much will it cost you not to have to learn DDEyourself?andP;  $995 for the Windows version, and $1495 for the OS/2 version.andP;  Thedde/XPress program will be available in September.andM;ETN Corp., RD4, Box 659, Montoursville, PA 17754; (717) 435-2202.)andM;&quot;DDE has a hole you can drive a Buick through,&quot; says Alan Cooper, author ofMicrophone II for Windows.andP;  In order to initiate a DDE conversation, you haveto specify the name of the program you're communicating with--and there is nostandard way to specify a program's name.andP;  Is it the name of the .EXE file?andO;A user can change that name, or assign different names to the same program ondifferent disks.andP;  Does the name include the path?andP;  The path can change, too.andM;But beyond the standardization issue, Cooper believes DDE is both ugly andstupid.&quot;andP;  I design IPC's (interprocess communications protocols).andP;  The pointof an IPC is to insulate you from the unknown, and if a protocol forces youto know specifically who you are talking to, why do you need it?&quot;andM;Cooper has authored an IPC he calls SPIDR.andP;  &quot;I think of SPIDR as a generalpurpose data transfer protocol,&quot; he says.andP;  In a SPIDR application, usersclick on a representation of data in one application, then drag it to atarget application where it is released--and transferred.andM;An acronym for Standard Pickup and Drop, SPIDR is implemented via amessage-based protocol.andP;  It can transfer data in predefined Clipboardformats, or in any proprietary format known to both sender and receiver.andO;Cooper currently offers SPIDR as a set of source-code modules that performthe bookkeeping for the SPIDR process.andM;Meanwhile, Cooper is moving a set of Mac-based IPCs over to Windows.andP;  Hedescribes them as a series of 'ombudsman' programs that hand messages aroundon request.andP;  &quot;The point is, DDE is so bad that alternatives will continue tocrop up.&quot;andM;Cooper Software, 167 Hamilton Avenue, 4th Floor, Palo Alto, CA 94301: (415)326-4567.andM;We've all heard that DDE is marvelous, and software authors should put itinto their programs because it's going to change the way we look atcomputing.andP;  So we asked network integrator Stan Levine of Automated DesignSystems if this is true...andM;Levine: I would make a distinction between the Windows DDE protocol and theterm 'Network DDE.'andP;  DDE is an interface for passing messages betweenprograms within the Windows environment.andP;  It is useful.andP;  On the other handNetwork DDE is used to describe products allowing peer-to-peer communicationsover a network from one DDE-compatible program to another.andM;Certain companies and the press have embraced the concept of Network DDE as amagical solution for sharing data between Windows applications over anetwork.andP;  As proof of this concept, we are presented with examples of usersaccessing each other's spreadsheets over a LAN.andP;  I doubt very much whetherthis type of capability will ever be used by anyone for anything practical.andO;In fact, I find the whole concept full of hype and destined to be yet anotherdisappointment for end users.andM;ACKnowledge: Why do you say that?andM;Levine: It's very poorly conceived.andP;  For example, I would not use a NetworkDDE implementation which did not incorporate some security mechanism.andO;Otherwise, an unauthorized person might be able to read or modify myspreadsheets, or consume my CPU resources at a time which is inconvenient tome.andP;  Yet, If I have the ability to deny you access to data which I control, Iam an unreliable server.andP;  This is not the way to construct an informationsystem.andM;In addition, a DDE-based server program could never support more than a fewusers at any one time.andP;  Why would an unreliable, limited-access data serverbe an exciting concept to corporate IS planners or systems integrators?andO;Network DDE is a solution which we haven't found a problem for.andP;  So why arewe spending all this time on it?andM;ACKnowledge: How many DDE network implementations are there?andM;Levine: I know of four, in various stages of completion: DaVinci, NetLogic'sDDE/X, Midland Bank, and Lambda's Pipes implementation.andP;  Microsoft is alsorumored to be working on one.andP;  I believe that only NetLogic is shipping aproduct today.andM;ACKnowledge: Whenever a developer wants to astound the Windows faithful, heshows a realtime DDE link between his program and Excel.andP;  Are you sayingNetwork DDE is something nobody needs?andM;Levine: I'm saying that Network DDE, as a peer-to-peer networking mechanism,is an unreliable way of sharing information.andP;  Think about why file serversare so popular; they deliver information upon demand, reliably and securelyto a large number of users.andP;  That's why NetWare file servers succeed in themarketplace whereas MS-Net peer-to-peer servers failed miserably.andP;  If you aregoing to use DDE over a network, there are better, easier, more reliable waysto do it.andM;ACKnowledge: Name a better way.andM;Levine: How about SQL Server?andP;  Everyone has seen the Excel demo which usesDDE to extract data from SQL Server.andP;  This demo provides a perfect examplefor using DDE to access data over a network.andM;SQL Server is a true server which makes information available to any numberof users simultaneously.andP;  Programs communicate with SQL Server through a setof database functions called DBLibrary, which hides the complexity of networkprotocols such as Named Pipes, NetBIOS, TCP/IP, IPX, etc.andP;  During the demo,Excel communicates with DBLibrary using a small program called a DDE engine.andO;This provides a link to SQL Server which non-programmers can easily use fromwithin off-the-shelf programs like spreadsheets and word processors.andP;  This isnot peer-to-peer DDE over a network, but rather a DDE interface to a truenetworked application.andP;  The other advantage to this approach is that theserver need not understand DDE or even be a PC.andM;Another example of a good use for DDE over a network is a technology known asRemote Procedure Calls.andP;  RPCs are something we will be hearing a lot about inthe next year or two because they provide a bridge between the old world ofminis and mainframes and the new world of distributed computing.andM;RPCs function locally (on your PC), but execute remotely (on a minicomputeror a mainframe).andP;  You can take Fortran code that's been sitting around forten years on a VAX and with an RPC, write an interface that lets the PC callthat Fortran function.andP;  It executes on the VAX with no screen I/O, and sendsthe result back to the requesting PC.andP;  It's a way of prolonging the life ofexisting systems, cutting down overhead, and providing a transparent way fornew Windows applications to access data over the network using DDE.andP;  In fact,the Excel-SQL Server demo is an example of an RPC link, except that an OS/2machine takes the place of the minicomputer.andP;  The PC doesn't care what's atthe other end, it just calls a function and gets a result.andP;  We have writtenmany programs which allow standard Windows applications to access data onremote hosts in realtime using DDE and RPCs.andM;ACKnowledge: Where and how do you see DDE being used?andM;Levine: DDE makes sense in an application-to-application link inside a PC.andO;It allows off-the-shelf software to use programs which connect you to theoutside world.andM;For example, Wall Data Corp.'s Rumba is a 3270 emulator that uses DDE, butnot to hook to the mainframe.andP;  For that they use SDLC and their ownproprietary software.andP;  They provide a DDE interface to enable the integrationof main demo which allows Asymetrix Toolbook to act as a front end to (IBM's)Profs using Rumba.andM;DDE is useful in a networking environment because its a standardized,published interface for distributed processing, and everybody understands it.andO;You can use it to extract data from a database server, get realtime data froma VAX, or integrate 3270 applications from within your spreadsheets.andP;  Butthat's different than so-called Network DDE.andM;ACKnowledge: Most people think of distributed processing as either IBM'smainframe-central model, or Microsoft's peer-to-peer model.andM;Levine: There isn't much difference between them.andP;  The fact is that both theIBM and the Microsoft distributed model is server-based.andP;  Just think of aserver as a black box.andP;  That black box can be a dedicated 386 server, aminicomputer, or a 3090 mainframe.andM;You still need server-type processing running in your black box to allownetworking.andP;  And both the IBM and Microsoft view counts on true, preemptivemultitasking--an OS/2 specialty--to provide reliable non-dedicated datasharing services on a PC.andM;They call this distributed processing, and it's more distributed than havingeverything happen on a mainframe.andP;  But it still calls for centralization.andO;We've replaced huge, faceless mainframes with very small, very friendlymainframes.andP;  The whole industry is going in the direction of friendly littlemainframes in the form of LANs.andM;ACKnowledge: What about traditional file servers?andM;Levine: File servers, which are currently the hub of LANs, are becoming farless important in the scheme of things as we move to distributed processingand client-server computing.andP;  For example, file servers have never been aserious platform for large databases--data was too easily corrupted and wasinaccessible from outside the LAN.andP;  A better solution is the database serverwhich is faster and infinitely more reliable.andP;  Database servers are some ofthose black boxes referred to earlier.andP;  The PC user doesn't know or care thatit's a 386, a VAX, or a mainframe.andP;  File servers will always be useful, butnew classes of application servers for database and communications functionsare replacing the file server as the hub of corporate LANs.andM;Another point: You can embed a business model right into a database server.andO;This is important.andP;  A program like Excel can not only query, but can actuallyupdate a database without somebody accidentally blowing away the company'sdata.andM;Traditional database programs always contained business rules inside eachapplication like 'if a customer has outstanding invoices, don't delete thatcustomer's name.'andP;  Those kinds of rules aren't built into spreadsheets.andM;ACKnowledge: In a LAN-centric world, does Unix have a role?andM;Levine: Yes, as an applications server.andP;  Unix might play host to yourcommunications server, your database server or even your file server.andP;  Unixhas a place as an applications server because it's mature and gives us accessto a lot of very interesting programs, especially from the engineering andfinancial world.andP;  But from a 'client' point-of-view, most programs willprobably be written for Windows and Presentation Manager.andP;  The emergence ofX-Windows terminal emulators running under Windows 3.0 and PresentationManager will also allow PCs to take advantage of the more interesting Unixapplications.andM;ACKnowledge: Do you see corporations committing to Windows?andM;Levine: Yes, I do.andP;  Windows is a standard corporations can get serious with.andO;It has all the elements of a good corporate solution: easy to install, easyto use, easy to support, and has a clear growth path towards the future.andO;Corporations need standards in order to make sense out of all the technologybeing hurled at them.andP;  Windows couldn't have happened at a better time.andM;For example, the memory crunch was getting critical, especially on networks.andO;Corporate users would try to load their 3270 or VAX protocols along withtheir LAN software and find that they couldn't run their spelling checkers orspreadsheets.andP;  They were out of memory.andP;  In response came Lotus 3.0 andAutoCAD and Oracle, all with incompatible extended and expanded memoryarchitectures.andP;  Or utilities such as 386 MAX, Desqview, and AllChargeCards.andO;Corporate users aren't stupid, but these solutions required several full-timerocket scientists in order to make them work.andP;  They just were notsupportable.andP;  Do we really wonder why PCs are unpopular with corporate MIS?andM;Now multiply the problem by tens of millions of new users and PCs over thenext 3-5 years, and you can see why a supportable standard is so important.andO;Windows 3.0 and Windows applications are by far the best solution simplybecause they constitute a standard that can be supported in a corporateenvironment.andP;  Features like memory management ability, a common userinterface, multitasking, DDE, and DLLs, all add up to Windows becoming thecorporate MIS standard of the '90s.andP;  This is especially true given theenhancements being planned for Windows 4.0.andM;ACKnowledge: What are they planning for Windows 4.0?andM;Levine: Well, we'll certainly see multimedia as one of the majorenhancements.andP;  But I'm more concerned with corporate computing issues such asNetworking.andP;  We are actively talking with Microsoft right now, trying tosteer them in the direction of supporting networks more thoroughly.andM;Individual vendors such as WordPerfect have historically built certainnetworking functions into their applications.andP;  Unfortunately, the level ofnetwork support has always been inconsistent from vendor to vendor, and evenwithin applications from a single vendor.andP;  Windows can change all that.andO;Windows 3.0 provides us with the opportunity of building networkingfunctionality right into the environment itself.andP;  Automated Design offers aproduct called Windows Workstation that extends the Windows environment tosupport networking--sort of an environmental software application thatextends the reach of off-the-shelf Windows applications.andM;The environment is key.andP;  If you extend the environment, all the applicationsbenefit, and all users benefit.andP;  Microsoft needs to ask its corporatecustomers: What do you need to build, manage, and support large corporatesystems?andP;  It should pay attention, and then build an answer to that questioninto all future versions of Windows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
