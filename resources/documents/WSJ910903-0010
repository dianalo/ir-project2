Whatever the panel recommends for Centocor's Centoxin andXoma's Xomen E5-two experimental treatments for rampantbacterial infections that can lead to shock and other eventsthat kill 70,000 people a year -- investors can expect atorrent of buy and sell orders and zigzagging share pricesthroughout the day.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There will be more cellular phones in the {Rockville,Md.,} hearing room than there are in a Motorola warehouse,&quot;says Robertson andamp; Stephens analyst Mark Simon.   When the smoke clears Thursday after what David Webber atAlex. Brown andamp; Sons calls &quot;the gunfight at Rockville Corral,&quot;the view for the winners could be spectacular. If Xoma winsthe panel's favor and Centocor doesn't -- Mr. Webber'sadmittedly contrarian view -- Xoma shares could nearly doubleto $40, analysts predict.   But if Centocor wins and Xoma loses, Xoma might plummet tosingle digits from Friday's 23, up 2 1/8 on the day. Centocorshares could rise to the mid-40s or fall to the low 20s, inthe best- and worst-case scenarios; they were at 33 1/4, off1/4, Friday.   Some people think a more likely outcome is that the panelmay back both compounds. Though evidence of effectiveness issoft, neither drug has severe side effects and both would beused to treat people at high risk of dying. So why notapprove?   Still others think the panel might reject both drugs andask for more data. In any case, tomorrow's stock-price swingswill be hazardous enough for the big institutional investorsthat react immediately to clues they pick up from panelists'questions and company responses. Without equal access toinformation from such meetings, the average investor &quot;getstotally burned,&quot; Mr. Simon says. Still interested? Then herecommends placing your bet today, and then fastening yourseat belt until the FDA's rulings are clear.   Even the pros' interpretations can be dead wrong. In June,when another Xoma drug was up for consideration, the earlyreading from harsh FDA staff questions sent the stock downmore than $5 by midday. But the panel recommended approvalanyway and the stock recovered most of its losses by theclose of trading.   Both drugs are genetically engineered antibodies designedto neutralize endotoxins that, when released by certainbacteria in the bloodstream, provoke a chain of eventsleading to shock, organ failure and death. Centoxin isderived from human and mouse antibodies; Xomen E5 comes frommice alone. Two published studies, one on each drug, indicateeach improve survival among a different portion of the500,000 U.S. patients who show symptoms of &quot;gram-negativesepsis&quot; each year. But neither improved survival rates amongthe entire group.   FDA panels generally like clearer evidence that drugs workbefore approving them. And both are likely to be veryexpensive-price estimates range from $2,000 to $4,500 a dose.While the FDA considers only safety and effectiveness inevaluating drugs, it isn't immune to worries about releasingone that could result in heavy costs for minimal results.   Tomorrow's hearing is the apex of a two-yearroller-coaster ride for investors in both stocks, with thedips and turns particularly sharp of late. Scientific data onthe effectiveness of the drugs that would normally bedisclosed only in medical journals or at the FDA panelmeeting itself have been revealed -- and dissected -- intestimony in recent weeks at a patent infringement trialcurrently under way in a federal district courtroom in SanFrancisco.   Analysts have combed the trial evidence for potentialimpact on the FDA panel's deliberations, and then takenpositions based not so much on P-E ratios as on &quot;P values,&quot;the numbers researchers use to gauge the statisticalsignificance of experimental findings.   Much of what they've found has been disappointing. Xoma,which traded as high as 26 1/4 on July 31 plunged 42% to aslow as 15 1/4 by Aug. 19, largely on testimony that anunpublished second clinical trial failed to confirmjust-published results that Xomen E5 saves lives. &quot;With thatdisclosure, everyone had to agree that E5 was inferior toCentoxin,&quot; says Robert Kupor, a Kidder Peabody analyst andlongstanding supporter of Centocor.   Not everyone agrees. The second trial did confirm thatXomen E5 benefits patients with organ failure, notes DavidStone, analyst at Cowen andamp; Co. And the trend toward improvedsurvival, though not statistically significant, was positive.He says patients in the second study weren't as sick as inthe first one, and may have been treated earlier in thecourse of the illness. As a result, not enough patients diedfor the survival data to have statistical power.   He thinks the FDA panel will recommend approving the drugfor early symptoms of sepsis, making it available for a largeportion of people who develop the ailment. &quot;If you show abenefit at top of patient population funnel, you willmotivate the physician to use it early,&quot; he says, giving Xomaa possible marketing advantage over Centoxin if both drugsare approved.   Meanwhile, Centocor also suffered in the patent trialtestimony, and its shares have lurched between 30 3/4 and 371/4 since late July. The major factor: testimony from a Xomaexpert witness who challenged the only major trial thecompany ran on its drug. For instance, at one of 24 medicalcenters that participated in the Centoxin trial, all eightpatients who received the drug survived while all eight whoreceived a placebo died, such an unusual result, the experttestified, that the whole center could represent astatistical oddity. If that center's results are excluded,the statistical power showing Centoxin improves survivalrates vanishes. Moreover, Centocor hasn't conducted a secondtrial to confirm results of the first, a factor Alex. Brown'sMr. Webber thinks weighs against approval.   Nevertheless, the Centoxin study did show sharpimprovement in survival among very sick patients and Xoma'strial did not. That's one major reason why sentiment on WallStreet is in Centocor's favor. Another is the man versusmouse factor. In tests, hardly any Centoxin patientsdeveloped their own antibodies to reject a foreign invaderwhile nearly half of patients in Xoma's studies did.Centocor's boosters believe the company can market theproduct as a human monoclonal antibody and that doctors willoverwhelmingly choose it over a mouse-derived medicine.   But analysts supporting Xoma say Centocor's test forantibody response wasn't sensitive enough to pick up possiblereactions to the portion of mouse-derived material that is inCentoxin. They're betting that the FDA panel will blunt anyCentocor marketing advantage by refusing to agree to labelCentoxin as a &quot;human&quot; monoclonal antibody.   &quot;The degree of analysis that's been done by Wall Streetwill probably exceed the depth of the FDA's analysis,&quot; saysRobertson andamp; Stephens's Mr. Simon, who favors Centocor intomorrow's deliberations. But he has an idea for investorsfor whom P values are a quagmire: Buy shares of Chiron Corp.and Synergen Inc. two companies that along with Centocor havepromising next-generation anti-sepsis drugs in late stages ofdevelopment.   Then buy a cellular phone. In a couple of years, thosecompanies will get their turn at the FDA.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          After eight consecutive gains, the over-the-counter marketfell in light pre-holiday trading.
