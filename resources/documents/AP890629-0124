Anti-apartheid activists and conservatives reacted withskepticism to the proposal, which envisions blacks having a vote innational affairs within five years. Anglican Archbishop DesmondTutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight againstapartheid, rejected the plan outright.   The plan is part of the party's new election platform, which alsoholds out the possibility of giving the black majority a voice inwriting a new constitution.   The party held a one-day congress in Pretoria today and acceptedthe platform. No vote was held _ the congress simply adjourned withno delegates voicing objections to the plan.   Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated to replace retiringPresident P.W. Botha after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections,opened the meeting by saying the party could lead the country backinto the international community, which has condemned South Africa'ssystem of racial separation.   ``Our cause is just and the doors must open. We will not have togo crawling back, we will walk in proudly and with our heads high,''said de Klerk, who wept when the 1,500 delegates greeted him with astanding ovation in Pretoria City Hall.   A less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to Botha,who did not attend the meeting. The two have had strained relationssince March, when party leaders indicated they wanted Botha toresign so de Klerk could take over.   An editorial in the anti-apartheid Cape Times of Cape Towncomplained that the proposal provided for a bill of rights only as a``possible option'' and failed to say how blacks would beincorporated into the government.   ``Whatever its vote-winning merits for the NP, as a plan toresolve the South African crisis it is much too tentative,'' thenewspaper said.   Tutu said the platform it was designed to make apartheid morecomfortable rather than dismantle it.   ``We are not interested in reform. We want to see apartheidabolished,'' Tutue said today in Hilleroed, Denmark, where he wasattending a festival of the Danish national church.   Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the pro-apartheidConservative Party, said the plan would lead to majority rule bySouth Africa's 28 million blacks and deprive the 5 million whites ofinfluence in the writing of a new constitution.   Political analysts say the Conservative Party may gain some seatsin the national legislature as a result of the National Party reformproposals.   South Africa's apartheid system denies blacks a voice ingovernment and relegates them to separate housing, schools andhealth care facilities. Whites also control the nation's economy.   Many foreign governments have imposed economic sanctions andother limitations on dealing with South Africa in efforts to forcean end to apartheid.   Much of the National Party's platform represents a softening ofpolicies designed to maintain white control, and is seen asreflecting the views of de Klerk.   The five-year program includes removal of criminal penalties forresidential apartheid violations, more government subsidies formultiracial schools, removal of race as the major criterion foridentifying political groups, a bill of rights, and negotiating anew constitution with black leaders.   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla group called the platform an advance, but from a wrongposition.   ``It's a step forward to the extent that the National Partyrecognizes that South Africa cannot be ruled on the basis ofexclusive power for the white minority,'' Thabo Mbeki, secretary forinternational affairs, said Wednesday en route to the ANC's base inLusaka, Zambia.   ``But the position is wrong because it continues to define peopleas black and white and not as the people of South Africa. The periodof transition must emerge from negotiations.''   Clive Derby-Lewis, spokesman for the Conservative Party, likenedthe plan to ``the sales talk of an unscrupulous car dealer'' andsaid the National Party was hiding plans to go further in reducingracial laws.   ``It is completely different from what they really intend to do.It is real skulduggery,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Itwill generate further distrust in the Nationalists by theelectorate.''   Beeld, the leading Afrikaans-language newspaper, pro-governmentbut generally moderate in its views, said the party's plan ``has thepotential to create a new South Africa'' if carried out with vigor.</TEXT></DOC>
