But in the past few days, a few voices on theRepublican right have begun publicly agreeing with Pfc. Smith-- and in the process scaring the wits out of otherRepublicans who, ever since Barry Goldwater's 1964presidential campaign, have struggled against the image ofhaving an itchy nuclear trigger finger.   At a meeting of conservative political action committeeslast week, Jeffrey Wright, chairman of the Young Americansfor Freedom, called for using tactical nuclear weapons ifconventional bombing doesn't succeed in defeating SaddamHussein's forces. Immediately, U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia, the House GOP whip who was also attending theconference, sharply disagreed, arguing that such weapons areunnecessary and would set a dangerous precedent.   Those who are pressing for consideration of nuclearweapons argue that using them would be preferable to a longground war accompanied by mounting U.S. casualties. &quot;How muchis the political issue worth?&quot; asks U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, aconservative Republican from Indiana. &quot;Is it worth 5,000American lives? Ten thousand?&quot;   In Saudi Arabia, a U.S. Army colonel says &quot;we shouldnever, never rule out these weapons. They are the best thingswe have to take out armor and artillery.&quot;   Administration officials say using nuclear weapons for thefirst time since World War II would be a catastrophe for U.S.policy in the Middle East and make a mockery of U.S. effortsto halt the spread of nuclear arsenals.   Moreover, many experts say, it isn't even clear whethertactical nuclear devices would be the most effective tools todeploy on the battlefield. &quot;They aren't well-suitedmilitarily, and they would be a disaster politically,&quot; saysHarold Brown, President Carter's defense secretary.   Since the onset of the Cold War, the U.S. has maintained adeliberate ambiguity over whether it would use tacticalnuclear weapons. But that ambiguity has lately given way tosome confusion over U.S. policy in the Mideast war.   Senior military and civilian officials at the Pentagonwere irritated by a recent television interview in whichWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu, while discussingchemical weapons, seemed to rule out using tactical nuclearweapons. Later, Vice President Dan Quayle said that, whileuse of tactical nuclear weapons is unlikely, theadministration won't rule them out.   &quot;I think the administration would be wise to avoid anyassurances on non-use, especially since chemical weapons andother potentially unconventional weapons may be at SaddamHussein's disposal,&quot; says former Secretary of State AlexanderHaig, who was also supreme commander of North Atlantic TreatyOrganization forces in Europe.   &quot;Tac Nukes,&quot; as they are known in Pentagon jargon, arerelatively small weapons that kill with heat, blast orradiation. They were developed for the European battlefieldas a way for the U.S. to knock out large armored formationswithout incinerating cities along the way. The U.S. has about7,000 tactical nuclear warheads in its arsenal.   Some military strategists assert that tactical nuclearweapons would be effective in delivering pinpoint damageagainst just the kind of massive armor and infantry forcesthat Saddam Hussein is expected to mount if a ground warbegins, or to retaliate if Iraq uses chemical or biologicalweapons.   But other experts say that the political fallout from theuse of nuclear weapons by the U.S. could poison relationswith Muslim nations for decades. &quot;Using nuclear weaponsagainst an Arab state,&quot; says Graham Fuller, a former CentralIntelligence Agency analyst now with the Rand Corp., &quot;wouldsend a message to the world that when the United States usesnuclear weapons, it's the Japanese and the Arabs who getzapped.&quot;   Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms ControlAssociation, a private group, says: &quot;There is a moralfirebreak against using nuclear weapons. Who's going to signup for the new world order with a nuclear-happy nation?&quot;   There's no clear evidence about how willing the U.S.public would be to using nuclear weapons. A Gallup Poll inlate January found that 45% of those surveyed said that theywould favor the use of tactical nuclear weapons if it wouldsave U.S. lives. But another poll, commissioned by Cable NewsNetwork and Time magazine, found that 71% opposed usingnuclear weapons.   If the past is any guide, the public's willingness to usenuclear weapons will grow as the conflict drags on.   John Mueller, a political science professor at theUniversity of Rochester, says that shortly after the onset ofthe Korean war in 1950, about 19% of the public approved theuse of nuclear weapons against military targets. About 18months later, the figure climbed to 39%, and by 1953, 56% ofthe public favored use of atomic artillery shells.   Mr. Mueller, who wrote a book studying these trends, saysthat a similar pattern emerged in the Vietnam war. In 1965and 1966, he found, 10% to 15% said the U.S. should usenuclear weapons; the figure rose to 25% by 1968. Mr. Muellersays the figure never got as high as it did during the Koreanwar because &quot;the bombs got bigger and bigger&quot; and becameweapons that didn't have much usefulness in that kind ofcombat.   ---                Thinking the Unthinkable                                                                                                          Major tactical nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal                                                                                                                                         ESTIMATED NUMBER                                    OF WARHEADS                                                                                                             Pershing II Missiles              125      Lance Missiles                  1,300      Tomahawk Missiles                 300      Artillery Shells                1,500      Bombs and depth charges         4,000                                                                                                          Source: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</TEXT></DOC>
