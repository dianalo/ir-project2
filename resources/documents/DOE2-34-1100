Among thepassive solar systems, passive solar heating systems are the most promisingones. Dealing with hydroelectric power, wind power, photovoltaics, solarthermal conversion, and hydrogen as a secondary solar energy source thepaper discusses the future development of solar energy utilization fromthe research point of view. A brief account of the short- and medium-termfeasibility of solar energy utilization in the Federal Republic of Germanypoints out the actual present solar energy potential as lying idle butthrough a lack of information, insufficient financial incentives andthe neglected revision of relevant regulations. Solar water heating andpassive solar space heating systems are considered the most promisingfields of application.</TEXT></DOC>
