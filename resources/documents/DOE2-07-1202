Neuroradiologic evaluation consists of CTand angiography only infrequently resulting in preoperative diagnosis.Five surgically confirmed cases were evaluated with CT, MR, and angiography.A characteristic appearance of cavernous hemangioma was noted on MR images.Loculated areas of high-intensity signal divided by low-intensity septationswere seen on both T1 and T2 pulse sequences. The high-intensity signalis due to methemoglobin from previous hemorrhage, while areas of low-densityrepresent hemosiderin. The MR appearance is corroborated by the histopathologicspecimens. Preoperative diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma is importantclinically since removal of this malformation is relatively easy comparedwith more highly vascular lesions. Multiplanar MR images also demonstratemalformation size and location with detail superior to CT, permittingmore precise surgical approach. All of the authors' patients, includingone with a pontine lesion, were neurologically intact following operation.The increased specificity of MR in the diagnosis of cavernous hemangiomasmakes it a necessary adjunct in the evaluation of these often &quot;cryptic&quot;lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
