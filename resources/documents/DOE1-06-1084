The most common indicationsfor operation were esophageal strictures that developed after lye ingestionand reflux strictures not responding to other treatment. The operationswere performed without thoracotomy by blunt esophageal dissection in80% of the patients. There were 18 antiperistaltic and seven isoperistalticcolon grafts. A large-field gamma camera and computer system were used.Data were collected at time intervals of 0.5 second during the first30 seconds and at intervals of 30 seconds up to 20 minutes. The 5% and90% stomach filling times, times to 50% and 25% activity levels, andresidual activity levels as a percentage of the maxima were calculatedin the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the colon grafts and of thenormal esophagus of 10 healthy control subjects. The examinations wereperformed with the subject in a sitting position. All parameters showedthat emptying of the colon graft was markedly slower than that of thenormal esophagus. The intra-abdominal third of the graft had a residualactivity of 50.5% +/- 15.7% after 20 minutes' observation. No differencesbetween antiperistaltic and isoperistaltic grafts were observed. Reconstructionwith proximal cologastric anastomosis and a short intra-abdominal colongraft segments is suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
