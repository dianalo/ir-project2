The charge of corruption, analogous to a bribery allegation in the U.S., represents one of Britain's most serious statutory offenses and can be brought only with the attorney general's permission.    Mr. Flawn, who turns 39 years old later this month, was arrested in September on six counts of theft and charged with defrauding Johnson Matthey Bankers. In June 1984, he resigned from the bank, where he had been assistant manager of the banking department. After appearing in court yesterday, he declared his innocence of all charges.    Mr. Flawn's arrest was the first to show that fraud may have played a part in the bank's bad debts equivalent to nearly $400 million. The bad debts prompted the Bank of England to rescue it in October 1984. During the past six weeks, police have arrested three other men -- two of them former bank customers -- on charges of fraud in dealing with JMB.    Bank customers allegedly offered bribes or falsified accounting documents to obtain favorable loan arrangements, according to sources close to Britain's attorney general. For the past 15 months, police have committed 40 investigators to the JMB case and there may more arrests before the probe ends, sources close to the government's Department of Public Prosecutions say. </TEXT></DOC>
