In 1986 theoil production of Abu Dabi was about 950,000 barrels/day, and accountedfor about 90% of the total production of the Emirates. The confirmedreserves was 31 billion barrels, accounting for 95% of the total reservesof the Emirates. Accordingly, the petroleum policies of Abu Dabi is soimportant that the Emirates economy depends on the policies. On the otherhand, the oil production of Dubai was about 350,000 barrels/day, andthe confirmed reserves was 1.4 billion barrels in 1986. The politicaland economical controlling power of the Emirates has been weakened, whichhas been caused by the severe restriction of oil production and the decreasein oil price, and is typically seen from the antagonism between Abu Dabiand Dubai, so that each emirate behaves independently.
