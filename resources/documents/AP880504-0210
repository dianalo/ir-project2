In a brief statement, the State Department said it still wasawaiting details about the terms under which the three Frenchmenwere released earlier Wednesday in Beirut.   ``We would be concerned by any sign that concessions weremade,'' the State Department said. ``We believe concessionsencourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity ofother hostages.''   There were news reports last November that France paid a ransomfor the release of a French television worker by his kidnappers inLebanon.   The release of the three Frenchmen leaves 18 foreigners,including nine Americans, missing and believed held captive inLebanon. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
