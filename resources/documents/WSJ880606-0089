The option is especially appealing, they said, because demand for organs is up but donations are down.    &quot;There are a lot of people that can be helped that you would otherwise have waiting in line,&quot; said Dr. Dixon Kaufman, a transplant fellow at the University of Minneosta.    &quot;The point is, don't just discount&quot; kidneys from family members whose tissue doesn't properly match the recipient's, he said at the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.    To do so is &quot;absolutely criminal,&quot; said John Najarian, a transplant surgeon at the University of Minnesota. &quot;The very best cadaver kidney won't touch the worst living-related donor. Never has, never will.&quot;    The practice of removing one of two kidneys from a healthy person for transplantation was common in the 1960s and 1970s, because of ineffective anti-rejection medicine. But now that therapy is improved and overall success rates are up, some doctors contend it isn't worth putting two people -- donor and recipient -- at risk.    Though none of the living donors in Minnesota has suffered major complications, there are reports of 20 fatalities world-wide as a result of kidney donation.    &quot;It would be nice if we had enough cadaver donors so we wouldn't have to do living-related donors at all, but we don't,&quot; said Dr. Robert J. Corry of the University of Iowa.    Of the 8,972 kidney transplants performed in 1987, down slightly from the previous year, about a quarter of the organs were provided by healthy family members, according to Dr. Barry Kahan, director of organ transplantation at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.    Though that total is down considerably from years past, the numbers could be headed back up, as a result of the recent slide in organ donation, Dr. Kahan said. At the same time, the number of people awaiting a kidney transplant has continued to mount.    For insular dependent diabetics, time is of particular importance, because they don't tolerate dialysis as well as others with kidney failure.    &quot;What the University of Minnesota has found is a logical extension&quot; of how to deal with the shortage of organs from brain-dead donors, Dr. Kahan said. &quot;We need to make family members aware of the fact that donations from the living may be the most efficient way to get transplanted.&quot;    Dr. Kaufman and his associates at Minnesota looked at the success rates of 657 transplants performed from 1980 to 1987, 315 of them involving organs from healthy brothers or sisters.    Of the 149 instances in which the recipient got a perfectly matched kidney from a sibling, the organs were functioning in 94% of the cases two years after surgery, Dr. Kaufman said. All six antigens, or genetic markers, were shared by the donor and recipient.    The success rate was 91% for the 131 who received a partly matched kidney, in which three to five antigens were shared by the siblings. And it was 93% for the 35 who got an organ from a sibling with only one or two antigens in common.    That compared with an overall success rate of 74% for the patients who received kidneys from brain-dead victims after waiting as long as several years, Dr. Kaufman said. The success rate climbed to 78% when four to six antigens were matched between donor and recipient.    The findings aren't meant to suggest &quot;in any way, shape or form&quot; that it doesn't matter who the donor is, as long as they are alive and well, according to Dr. Kaufman.    &quot;When you are related . . . you are inheriting other chromosomes that may have a beneficial effect on your kidney,&quot; he said. &quot;Whereas, somebody who is totally unrelated, just because they're alive, may not pass along that added benefit. And in that case, it truly may not be any better than having a cadaver kidney.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
