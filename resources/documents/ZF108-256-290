the CPU is usuallyradically different according to manufacturer and model, the displays allvary slightly in resolution, and the operating systems are oftenmanufacturer-derived versions (usually of Unix).andP;  But there is a commontheme: all those that I've seen up to now have one acronym that doesn'tchange across the board: SCSI.andM;The Small Computer System Interface is used by any self-respecting machine asthe means of talking to mass storage devices.andP;  Actually, that last statementis incorrect since SCSI is the method used for communications between thehost CPU and the controller.andP;  How the controller then directs the disk drivein its actions is of no concern to the host CPU -- in fact, it's often usingan ESDI system.andM;A little history would, perhaps, be useful.andP;  Most original PCs and ATs basedon the 8088 and 80286 use an interface developed by Seagate, the ST-506/412.andO;the controller need not be particularly intelligent and provides a maximumdata transfer rate of 5Mbits per second.andP;  Unfortunately, the early PCs intowhich this type of controller was fitted couldn't cope with high datatransfer rates so the hard drives had to be slowed down -- effected byincreasing the interleave factor up to 6:1 (with faster machines this couldbe reduced to 2:1).andM;The next step up is the ESDI (Enhanced Small Device Interface) standard.andO;This is a better version of the ST-506 standard, uses similar methods and isaimed at controlling small, high-speed fixed disks.andP;  An ESDI controllertransfers data at 10 to 15Mbits per second and new versions will manage 20 to24Mbits per second.andP;  Larger capacity drives can also be handled -- twice thatof an ST-506 controller.andM;Finally, at least for the moment, is SCSI.andP;  Both the previous interfaces weredevice-oriented; SCSI is system-oriented.andP;  Both the ST-506 and ESDIinterfaces require more work from the host CPU whilst one of SCSI's purposesis to move peripheral-controlling intelligence away from the host to theperipheral.andM;The simplest SCSI interface is just an asynchronous link from computer todisk drive.andP;  Along this, data can travel currently at around 1.5Mb persecond, with developments occuring stretching it to 4Mb per second.andP;  Apartfrom the physical movement of the drive head, there's a time overhead due toSCSI instruction translation.andM;It's these instructions that make SCSI so powerful -- although with thetranslation and execution overhead mentioned a minus.andP;  However, some of theseonly really become apparent in multi-disk or other complex set-ups where, forinstance, the SCSI device can be told to release the system bus whilstretrieving the data: the bus is then freed up for the host CPU to carry ondealing with other tasks.andP;  This is particularly pertinent within amulti-tasking system, since it prevents a slow drive stretching any onetasks' time slot.andM;The other big advantage becomes obvious when you examine just how the CPUasks the controller for data.andP;  To retrieve a chunk of data, only the logicalsector position has to be supplied, it's up to the controller to sort out the'real' positional information and step the drive accordingly.andP;  This meansthat the host computer needs not, and usually doesn't, know what the storagedevice is.andP;  So, any SCSI-compatible drive can be plugged on to any controllerand work -- that's the theory.andM;One of the problems is that up until now I've been talking about SCSI 1.andO;This standard has a number of loopholes through which incompatibilities cansneak.andP;  To sort out some of these problems, SCSI 2 was devised.andP;  It aims toshift even more processing power over to the peripheral, and includes acommand buffer and a more comprehensive command set to cope with the newtypes of storage device on the market -- namely CD-ROMs, scanners and opticalmemory.andM;SCSI is currently the fastest standard that's been widely adopted andimplemented.andP;  One of the problems that's just coming to light in the power-PCplatform is that the speed limits have been reached on all components, socacheing is being added -- and in a big way.andP;  The Elonex 486 PC, oftenreferred to here, has its own memory controller chips and, according to thedesigner, a streamlined path to the EISA bus.andP;  The trouble is that the EISAbus can shift data at 33Mb per second, the SCSI controller can't.andP;  The answeris to add a cache, and it has added a 32Mb cache!andM;Other WorldsandM;For users involved in high-end colour graphics and image processing, therewere some impressive exhibits at Macworld Expo '90.andP;  Fighting through theportable phones and Porches I came across the Du Pont GIP systems.andP;  Anunprepossessing beige box houses the GIP-32 graphics processor: it's a 20mipsbit-slice processor that can talk to a Sun, PC or MAC II then display1,280x1,024 in 24-bit colour accessed by either C-language routines or itsown implementation of X-Window.andP;  There's also an 8 or 24-bit frame grabberand output to broadcast standard (PAL or NTSC).andP;  Expansion allows you to add2.2Gb of disk-based storage and 160Mb of frame storing memory.andM;This was one of the more powerful systems available, the main thrust of theother stands still being towards designers.andP;  It seems that the Macintosh, atleast, is still thought of as a 'trendy' arty tool, or at any rate, that'swhat sells: not a spreadsheet or database in sight.andP;  Come to think of it, Ican't remember too many workstation manufacturers showing off the power oftheir latest baby by running a spreadsheet.andP;  Perhaps a new definition ofworkstation should be 'a machine that can display graphics impressive enoughto attract a wow from any passer-by'?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
