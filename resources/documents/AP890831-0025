The Wyatt Co. of Philadelphia, in what is described as the mostcomprehensive study of the government's salary system, alsorecommends supplemental pay for top federal executives in high-costcities _ Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and its environs andpossibly in Boston and Washington.   The company offered a third idea Wednesday for enabling thegovernment to compete with private enterprise: It wants to let allgovernment agencies pay up to 15 percent above normal salaries to asmany as 5 percent to 10 percent of their employees.   The proposal to set aside normal pay schedules for the top 500career posts in government was intended to address a frequentlycited problem _ the difficulty of recruiting and retaining officialsfor jobs requiring rare expertise.   Such jobs as running the National Cancer Institute, givingscientific direction to the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration or running federal nuclear facilities often are hardto fill. The government competes with universities and industry forthose people.   In calling for geographic differentials, the Wyatt report didn'tspecify their size, but it would restrict the differentials toprofessionals and administrators ``in a limited number of high-payareas.'' The only ones specified were the New York region, the twoCalifornia cities and possibly Boston and Washington.   The study said that if all its recommendations were accepted agap of 14 percent still would exist between what the government paysits 1.4 million white-collar workers and what they could earn inprivate enterprise.   ``Overall, the primary problem is that federal salaries havefallen so far behind the pay offered by other employers that it isdifficult to recruit and retain adequately qualified workers in someoccupations and locations,'' the report said.   ``These problems will become progressively more severe over thenext several years.''   As a result of the problem, the company noted, governmentagencies use ``back door'' methods to reward employees.   For example, attempts to provide competitive pay can take theform of ``grade creep,'' in which workers are promoted to higherclassifications to get them more money, the report noted.   The study was conducted under contract to the Office of PersonnelManagement. The proposals would cost $6 billion to implement and thechanges would require congressional approval.   Earlier this month, an interagency group from the LaborDepartment, Office of Personnel Management and Office of Managementand Budget put the pay gap for all civilian government workers _ notjust white-collar workers _ at 28.6 percent. OPM, in a separatereport Wednesday, agreed with that figure.   The government's Advisory Committee on Federal Pay last weekrecommended a pay increase of 10 percent next year to help narrowthe gap.   ``The bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become acanyon,'' chairman Martin L. Duggan said.   But on Monday, President Bush, in accord with an agreement workedout by congressional leaders and administration officials lastspring, recommended an increase of 3.6 percent to take effect inJanuary.   Bush also has asked Congress to provide increases of 8 percent to25 percent to 7,900 top federal and military officials _ 700political appointees and 7,200 career executives, including topforeign service officials and three-star and four-star admirals andgenerals.   Most senior federal officials would get 25 percent raises,matching the 25 percent increase Bush has recommended for judges.Cabinet members would go from $99,500 a year to $124,400.   Bush said the increases were needed ``to address pay deficienciesfor employees with exceptional qualifications and to make pay morecompetitive at the senior levels of government.''   At the same time, the president proposed that all members of thesenior executive service _ the top levels of career employees _ berequired to undergo re-certification every three years to provetheir worth to keep the higher salaries.   Upon taking office, Bush endorsed a recommendation by PresidentReagan for a 51 percent increase for members of Congress, judges andfederal officials. Congress, bowing to a public outcry, rejected theidea.</TEXT></DOC>
