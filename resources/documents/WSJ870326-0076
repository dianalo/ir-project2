Combustion Engineering, a supplier of technical services and equipment to utilities and processing plants, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission registration statement that first-quarter net income will be &quot;in a range of 20% to 25% below&quot; its 1986 first quarter, when it earned $13.6 million, or 41 cents a share.    The company acquired AccuRay, a Columbus, Ohio-based maker of measurement and control systems, in January for $218 million.    The registration filing covers the issue of four million new common shares and $150 million of subordinated debentures due 2017. The company will use the proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes and to refinance short-term bank debt of $64.1 million and other costs associated with the AccuRay acquisition.    At year-end 1986, Combustion Engineering had 33.3 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
