The most optimistic outlook on the Bush proposal came from itschief Senate sponsor, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.   ``It's a package one could hardly be against,'' she said Tuesdayafter a Rose Garden ceremony at which Bush announced he was sendingit to Congress. Chances of passage are ``very good,'' saidKassebaum the senior Republican on the Senate educationsubcommittee.   But there were some who found reason to grumble, among them Rep.Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., and the 1.9-million-member NationalEducation Association. awkins, chairman of the House Education and Laboee,called Bush's plan ``a futile response to the growing crisis inAmerican education.'' He sno future on Capitol Hill.''   The Educational Excellence Act outlined by the president makesgood on many of his campaign promises, among them a $250 milliongrant program to reward schols that have cut drug use or dropoutrates, raised test scores or improved in other ways.   jor part of the package, proposed for fiscal 1990,calls for spending $100 million on a new magchools program.Schools would be encouraged to develop special with the objective of increasingopen enrollment andparental choice.   Other parts of the bill would reward outstanding teaience scholars,develop new ways to certify teachers, helpdrug-ridden urban schools and bolster the endowments ofhistorically black colleges.   Critics zeroed in on its fiscal modesty.   ``The fact that they can talk easily about raising $40 billionto bail out savings and loans and we're nickel-and-diming on theissue of children's education, talking ab0 million, isludicrous,'' said Ken Melley, chief lobbyist for the NEA.   ``The fact is, if the education budget were to just enjoy thecost of living increase that they give the defense budget, we wouldhave had another $900 million,'' he said.   Some juggling in the budget proposal submitted by formerPresident Reagan and later embraced by Bush would allow modestincreases in several rams such as Chapter 1, whichbolsters basic skills of disadvantaged students.   But critics say even those increases don't match inflation,aning schoolswould have to cut back on services.   Bush is ``attempting to strip programs long supported byCongress to pay for new initiatives of questionable value,''Hawkins charged. ``The Congress will not accept that lack ofcommitment to educaion investment.''   Not all Dmocrats were negative about the n.   ``This is an excellent initiative,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,D-R.I., chairman of the education subcommittee, who attendedthe Rose Garden announcemeo``motherhood'' and said its chances of passage are ``pretty good.''
