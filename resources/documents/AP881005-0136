SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House is considering asking Congressto soon release $16.5 million in stockpiled weapons to the Contrarebels in Nicaragua, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidWednesday.   ``We are analyzing that possibility,'' Fitwater told reportersat his daily briefing. ``A final decision has not been made at thispoint.''   Prospects for renewing military aid to the rebels has beendeemed a long shot by congressional leaders, who hope to have theSenate and House adjourn for the year next week so that lawmakerscan campaign full-time for re-election.   Congress rejected an administration military aid request lastFeb. 3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contrasoccurred on Feb. 29.   Some $16.5 million in military equipment has been stockpiled inHonduras. It was purchased with earlier U.S. aid, but its deliverywas frozen because of the peace process and cease-fire between theContras and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   Asked about the possibility of renewed aid, Fitzwater noted thata provision in defense appropriations bill Reagan signed lastweekend permits the president to request a congressional vote onwhether to release the weapons to the rebels.   The Pentagon bill ``authorizes the release of $16 million inlethal material that had been purchased earlier but had not beendelivered ... and it sets forth findings that the president wouldmake in requesting that release,'' the spokesman said.   He noted that under the legislation, the president must findthat Nicaragua has caused a crisis in Central America, theadministration must consult with the four Central Americandemocracies and then report to Congress justifying his request.   Fitzwater said the president's justification for the release ofthe aid must also meet two out of three conditions cited in thelegislation.   Of the three, he said, the administration believes two had beenmet _ continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinistaviolations of the peace accords.   The spokesman called the third condition _ that the Sandinistashave initiated an ``all-out attack'' against the Contras _ ``anopen question.''   ``The status is, it's all under consideration and we haven'tmade a formal decision,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
