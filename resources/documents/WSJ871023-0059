Garcia</HL><DD> 10/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market's rebound from its historic plunge earlier this week proved to be short-lived, as prices crumbled in heavy trading yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 77.42 to 1950.43. Yesterday's point decline is the sixth-largest on record for the industrial average. After plummeting 508.00 points Monday, the average managed to recoup more than half of its losses Tuesday and Wednesday.    Traders said the market was set up for a fall, because U.S. stocks were marked down significantly in London. U.S. firms got sell orders from European and Japanese investors as the session got under way. Selling by U.S. investors to meet margin calls added to the downward pressure on stock prices, traders in the U.S. said.    The industrial average tumbled about 140 points in the first hour of trading. Some bargain hunting and corporations' continued buying of their own shares helped the market recover some of its losses. The average traded in a narrow range in the afternoon.    The flight of capital from equities continued as stock prices retreated yesterday. Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds due in 30 years rose 3 5/8 points, or $36.25 for each $1,000 face value. Treasury bill rates dropped about one-third of a percentage point. Also, a record $9.6 billion flowed into money market mutual funds in the week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute in Washington, D.C.    The renewed sell-off was broad, as losers outnumbered gainers by a margin of more than 4-to-1. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.13 to 248.25, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 5.57 to 139.45.    About 392.2 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, compared with 449.4 million Wednesday. While yesterday's volume was about a third less than Tuesday's recordshattering 608.1 million shares, it was well above the recent pace of about 150 million shares a session.    The pressures of this hectic week are becoming increasingly visible in the financial community around the country. The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange decided to close at 2 p.m. Eastern time today, Monday and Tuesday to give brokerage firms and the exchanges a chance to process all of the transactions from the record volume of recent days. Trading in some stock-index futures also will shut down early, in line with the Big Board.    The reaction from traders was generally one of relief. James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said that &quot;the volume has been just incredible, but the automated systems can't handle it.&quot; He expects that the shorter trading days should give the firm's back office a chance to process all of its orders without forcing its employees to work late into the night.    The market's convulsions this week have shaken up many investors. As evidence, various analysts and traders noted that many investors were anxious because of rumored bearish forecasts on the market, from Robert Prechter, Peter Eliades and several other technical analysts with big followings, that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to retest the lows it made Monday. Mr. Prechter said late yesterday he thinks that in tumultuous markets like these, it is best to refrain from making public forecasts. Mr. Eliades believes that the Dow Jones industrials could fall as low as 1392, not all at once, but that it would be overdue after 15 to 20 weeks.    &quot;I don't know if investors really believe (these analysts), but they certainly do react to them,&quot; said a trader.    The influx of sell orders at the opening yesterday created huge imbalances, forcing many stocks to begin trading as much as an hour later; some opened as late as noon EDT. &quot;It was almost as bad as Monday,&quot; said one New York-based trader. The price swings also were wild. Digital Equipment opened at 125, down 19 1/2 points; it closed down 11 3/8 at 133 1/2.    Wall Street advisers also are taking a more cautious stand on the market. Shearson Lehman Brothers told clients to stay on the sidelines, expecting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to bounce around in a range between 1600 and 2100. Two other firms told clients to buy defensive stocks, such as electric utilities with high dividend yields.    All 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower. Among the big losers were Aluminum Co. of America, down 3 1/4 to 35 3/4; Merck, down 5 3/4 to 163 1/4; American Express, down 2 3/4 to 26; Bethlehem Steel, down 1 1/2 to 11 1/8; International Business Machines, down 2 3/4 to 120; and Philip Morris, down 5 1/2 to 91 1/2.    Prices rose on Tokyo stock exchange, but late selling trimmed some of the market's early gains. Stocks of Japanese companies traded in the U.S. market were crushed, although one trader said a little buying did lift some issues from their worst levels of the day.    Matsushita Electrical Industrial sank 15 1/2 to 142; Kyocera dropped 10 1/4 to 69 3/4; Hitachi slid 12 5/8 to 77 3/4; Sony fell 4 to 29 3/4; TDK lost 7 to 58 1/2; and Honda Motor declined 11 1/4 to 90 3/4.    Enron fell 2 3/4 to 37 1/4. The oil and gas concern said it expects to report a consolidated loss for the third quarter because of an $85 million after-tax charge, resulting from unauthorized trading at its oil trading subsidiary.    Digital Equipment and IBM weren't the only technology stocks hard hit yesterday. Honeywell fell 1 1/4 to 61 3/4; Unisys dropped 3 3/4 to 29 7/8; Hewlett-Packard lost 4 1/8 to 45 3/8; NCR moved down 3 3/4 to 60 3/4; and Tandem Computers declined 1 1/2 to 23 7/8.    In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer dropped 4 to 36 3/4; Microsoft fell 3 3/8 to 53 1/4; and Seagate Technology lost 1 to 13 1/2.    The number of announcements from corporations eager to buy back their own shares slowed down yesterday, but many were in the market putting their plans into action. Many traders said this corporate buying has provided a cushion for the market.    &quot;I can't envision how bad this market would have been without this corporate buying,&quot; said Peter DaPuzzo, senior executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific rose 1/2 to 51 on more than 5.3 million shares, making it the third most active Big Board stock. The railroad concern continued to be rumored as a takeover target and it is in the process of selling its Southern Pacific Transportation unit. Henley Group is believed to have accumulated millions of Santa Fe Southern shares this week, industry officials said.    KaiserTech slipped 1 1/2 to 8 3/4 on more than 4.6 million shares. A group led by Alan E. Clore said it had preliminary discussions with other investors regarding the sale of part or all of its stake in KaiserTech.    Gerber Products closed up 3/8 at 32 after trading as high as 34 3/4. The food company reported that operating earnings for its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to 88 cents a share from 59 cents a year earlier.    William Wrigley Jr. Co. jumped 1 1/4 to 48 3/4 in extremely active trading. A company spokesman told Dow Jones's Professional Investor Report that Wrigley had been buying back its own shares Wednesday and yesterday.    Some oil stocks advanced amid a flareup of new hostilities in the Persian Gulf and as crude prices edged higher. Despite the renewed attacks, no supply interruptions are seen. Amoco fell 1/2 to 68; Sun Co. gained 4 1/4 to 52; Mobil sank 2 to 39 1/2; Chevron lost 1 to 44; and Royal Dutch dropped 3 1/8 to 108 3/4.    ---               Largest Drops of DJIA    Date                 Close      Decline      % Chg.
