However, itwas not until the 1960s that much attention was paid to this matter,and in the early 1970s two important summer studies dealing with environmentalchange fired the imagination of the scientific community. Since thenthe science of modeling the climate system has made great strides, aidedby faster computers, greater knowledge of the factors involved, and globalobservations from space of the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Thiseffort has also been bolstered by studies of the behavior of the climatesystem in the past. There is now a strong consensus that the observedincrease in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and otherinfrared-absorbing trace gases is indeed warming the earth, and thatthis change is caused by mankind.</TEXT></DOC>
