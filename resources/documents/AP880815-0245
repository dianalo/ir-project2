And a proposal for the first authorized human gene transplant ison the agenda for the fall meeting of the National Institutes ofHealth's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.   Nonetheless, Rifkin's influence has been felt, in the boardroomas well as the courtroom.   ``Companies don't want to take Jeremy on head-to-head. It's alosing proposition. Companies don't want to get into emotionalsituations. They don't want to be perceived as being in the middleof a dogfight with Jeremy while they're out there trying to raisemoney,'' says Bruce Mackler, general counsel for the 180-memberAssociation of Biotechnology Companies.   ``The financial costs must be measured in terms of eroding ofinvestor confidence. People don't like to invest in industries...inwhich there are controversies.''   Mackler, an immunologist as well as a lawyer, calls Rifkin``very articulate, very persuasive and very dangerous. He has donemore to delay science, to erode public confidence in science, thanmany people.''   ``If he were at the end of the runway at Kitty Hawk, he'd beyelling `Don't do it until we develop a parachute! Don't do ituntil we know it can fly!'   Among scientists, Rifkin is regarded as a nuisance, says Dr.Gerard McGarrity, cell biologist at Coriell Institute for MedicalResearch in Camden, N.J., and chairman of the Recombinant DNAAdvisory Committee (RAC). It is the RAC's job to draft safetyguidelines for conducting genetic engineering research and todecide whether potentially hazardous research should be carriedout. RAC's guidelines are mandatory for government-sponsoredresearch; private industry has agreed to follow them voluntarily.   ``When someone opposes every new development, when he takes anextreme view on every issue, you have to wonder. Sometimes theperson standing on the periphery is a pioneer. But every issue?''Moreover, McGarrity adds, ``He operates on a very limitedscientific basis.''   He recalls that Rifkin once opposed a vaccine being developedagainst an organism that causes diarrhea. ``He feared it could beused in biological warfare,'' McGarrity says. ``In fact, we wantedto use it as a vaccine in developing countries where diarrhea is aproblem for thousands of children.''   Susan Gottesman, a former RAC member, says that Rifkin ``doesn'taddress science at all.'' Gottesman is chief of the BiochemicalGenetics Section of the National Cancer Institute's Lab ofMolecular Biology and a consultant to the federal EnvironmentalProtection Agency on biotech matters.   ``He makes absolute statements which sound scary, and he usesdiscussion points which are sure to appeal as you hear them,'' saysGottesman, who has debated Rifkin on television. ``It's hard forthe public to understand the science and the real differencebetween something that's scary and something that's not.''   Those views are echoed by others, who invariably single out``Algeny,'' one of the nine books Rifkin has written (each inlonghand on yellow legal pads), for their harshest criticism.   The author, an economics major who has had no formal sciencetraining, describes ``Algeny'' as ``a thoughtful and studiedcritique of the philosophy of modern science and technology.''   A Harvard University biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, called it ``acleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propagandamasquerading as scholarship.''   ``Among books promoted as intellectual statements by importantthinkers, I don't think I have ever read a shoddier work,'' Gouldwrote in 1985. ``Damn shame, too, because the deep issue istroubling and I do not disagree with Rifkin's basic plea forrespecting the integrity of evolutionary lineages.''   Rifkin does have a measure of support even among scientists,however.   Stuart Newman, a developmental biologist at New York MedicalCollege and a member of the Boston-based Committee for ResponsibleGenetics, acknowledges inaccuracies in Rifkin's writings, but says,``I see him more as an Old Testament prophet who raises importantissues that go beyond expertise.   ``I believe technology should be developed and fostered, butthere are other important issues. Society has a stake in makingsure the technologies are used safely and ethically. From thatperspective, I do think Jeremy Rifkin has performed a service bykeeping the issues of appropriate use of biotechnology in thepublic eye.''   Liebe F. Cavalieri of Sloan-Kettering Institute in Rye, N.Y., isa molecular biologist whose work with DNA dates to the discovery byWatson and Crick of the double helix 35 years ago. Cavalieriacknowledges ``soft spots'' in ``Algeny,'' but says scientists whodismiss his arguments as strictly emotional are ``throwing dustaround.''   ``Most scientists are trained not to think in broad, global waysand cannot see the possible outcome of this or that technology interms of societal impact. It's very difficult to get out of themold of scientist. We're trained in reductionist thinking,'' hesays.   ``But we have at our disposal methodology which can disruptliving systems...And I'm afraid we're not being selective.   ``We're not going to get a plague next week because somebodyreleased some nitrogen-fixing bacteria,'' Cavalieri adds. ``Theissue is much more subtle, and in a way, more dangerous. Theeffects will take place over time.''   Those subtle, long-term effects are at the heart of Rifkin'scrusade. He's not worried about killer tomatoes. He is worriedabout applying engineering principles to living things at theexpense of traditional human values.   ``It's called genetic engineering because it's about engineeringgenes, taking engineering principles and applying them to theblueprint of every aspect of life,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
