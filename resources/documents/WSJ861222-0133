But the analysts expect the expansion to be slight, despite recent record profits to producers. The bitter six-year agricultural recession has made hog producers and their lenders unusually cautious, and provisions of the new tax law are deepening producers' reluctance to expand.    Thus today's quarterly Agriculture Department report, a 50-state survey of hog herds that will be released after the market closes, &quot;will probably show some expansion, but I think it will be reserved compared to other years,&quot; says Ronald Kahle, a Kearney, Neb., hog raiser and president of the National Pork Producers Council.    The increase in pork output that is expected in late 1987 nevertheless should be large enough to trim average retail pork prices for the second half of the year by three to four cents a pound from a year earlier, says Raymond Daniel, an economist with Chase Econometrics, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.    However, analysts sometimes have been wrong in their predictions about the government's hog reports, and the reports themselves have generated controversy and charges of inaccuracy. Many analysts expected the first signs of a nationwide herd expansion to show up in government surveys as early as last June. Instead, the report then showed a significant cut in herds from year-earlier levels.    Today's report should show that the total population of breeding hogs rose to about 6.6 million as of Dec. 1 from 6.4 million June 1, says Charles Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. In contrast, the breeding herd showed a decline between June and December of last year -- to 6.8 million head from seven million.    Such a report would signal the beginning of a herd expansion, analysts say, despite the fact that the report will show a year-to-year decline in many measures. Many analysts, for instance, say the survey will show a 2% to 4% decline in hog herds as of Dec. 1 from a year earlier. The number of animals being prepared for slaughter as of Dec. 1 is expected to show a similar drop.    Estimates of the number of breeding animals, which is crucial to the size of future herds, range from flat with a year earlier to down 4%. Predictions of intended farrowings, or births, in December through February range from a 2% increase to a 5% decline, compared with 1985.    It may be March, when the actual number of births for this period are known, before the true scope of any expansion can be gauged, analysts say.    If the report is in line with analysts' estimates, it could lift hog futures prices briefly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says Joel Karlin, a director of research with Jack Carl/312 Futures Inc., Chicago.    The report's long-term impact, however, is difficult to forecast, partly because of the continuing skepticism over the accuracy of the data. In June, the government said the U.S. hog and pig population was running 7% below 1985 levels. By September, when a major survey of 10 producing states showed only a 5% decline, many analysts said they wondered where all the extra hogs had come from.    The beef industry will be taking some cues from the report, as it is the earliest indicator of meat supplies for next year. A full-blown expansion in pork output would depress not only pork prices but also futures prices for cattle for delivery late next year, when the increasing number of young hogs would be ready for slaughter.    The currently expected small expansion in hog herds, however, would mean little change in average consumer beef prices in 1987 from this year, Mr. Daniel says.    Many factors weigh against any boom in pork output. Mr. Kahle, the Nebraska producer, says he wants to raise as many animals as efficiently as he can -- as long as he doesn't have to seek new loans or other credit facilities.    &quot;Lenders have a conservative attitude,&quot; Mr. Kahle says. &quot;In some cases they're pretty pessimistic about where agriculture is going. They're pretty reluctant to lend funds for increasing volume through additional facilities.&quot;    Mr. Levitt says the new tax law, which generally means a loss of tax credits, income averaging and capital gains benefits for producers, also probably offset any strong incentives to expand. </TEXT></DOC>
