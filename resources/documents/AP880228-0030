Chen told 500 people at a church service in Taipei that theriots were ``painful history that cannot be forgotten orcovered.''Similar church services were held in three other cities.   Demonstrators carried banners and listened to speeches by humanrights activists to mark Feb. 28, 1947, when thousands of nativeTaiwanese rioted against the fledgling Nationalist government.Researchers estimate that 20,000 died when the governmentsuppressed the riots.   Taiwan came under Nationalist administration at the end of WorldWar II, when Japan relinquished its 50-year rule of the islandnation between the East and South China seas.   The country is controlled by the remnants of the Nationalistgovernment that fled mainland China in 1949 after losing the civilwar to the communists.   Opposition lawmakers have urged the government to include theriots in school textbooks.   In Tainan, 202 miles south of Taipei, about 2,000 members of theopposition Democratic Progressive Party staged a two-hour march,said party official Chang Kuo-tang in a telephone interview.   Protesters demanded official condolences to victims of theriots, Chang said. He said demonstrators would place more than2,000 floating lanterns on a canals to commemorate the victims.   President Lee Teng-hui criticized dissidents at a pressconference Monday for using the 1947 riots to ``incite thepublic.'' He said it is ``against the principle of love torepeatedly make the tragedy an annual topic.''   Lee, the first native Taiwanese to become president, urged thecitizenry to leave the incident to historians and ``remove the darkshadows from your mind. Have confidence in your country.''   Experts, however, say the deep divisions are fading with time.   ``The tension has subdued significantly, especially during therecent years when the government loosened its political controls,''said Lai Tse-han, professor of history at the National NormalUniversity.   The government has lifted 38 years of martial law and a ban onnew newspapers as part of its move toward democratic reforms.   Last year, about 13,000 people rallied to mark the anniversaryopenly for the first time.   Researchers say the 1947 rioting occurred after a group ofTaiwanese demonstrated in Taipei to protest Nationalist agents whoconfiscated money and belongings of a woman selling untaxedcigarettes. The Nationalists fired on the crowd and killed a man inthe incident.   The shooting touched off a series of riots across the island andthe subsequent response by the government.</TEXT></DOC>
