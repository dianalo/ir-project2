The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in the fire were loadedonto a cargo plane in New York on Saturday for the midnight flightto Honduras.   The government said the bodies were to arrive Sunday morning inSan Pedro Sula, 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa. It has said 79 ofthe people who died in last Sunday's fire at the Happy Land socialclub were Hondurans.   On Friday, Julio Gonzalez was indicted by a New York state grandjury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other charges connectedwith fire.   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, spilled gasoline in theentrance of the illegal club and torched it after being rejected bya girlfriend employed there, authorities said.   Nahum Valladares, Honduran information minister, said in atelephone interview that the bodies returned to Honduras will betransported on a DC-8.   The plane was chartered by the American Red Cross. Ed Hardy, aRed Cross spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims alsowere flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on regular commercialflights.   None was aboard the cargo plane, and none attended a memorialservice at the airport in New York.   The Honduran official said New York officials had also helpedarrange the special flight.   ``The government this week has held intense conversations withNew York officials, who offered their facilities to repatriate thedead and their families,'' Valladares said.   Monsignor Jaime Brufau, the Roman Catholic archbishop of SanPedro Sula, will officiate a Mass at the airport, and Callejas andhis Cabinet will attend, officials said.   Valladares said Honduran air force planes and helicopters willtake the remains to 12 locations in Honduras.   He said the bodies of some other victims would be brought backto Honduras through private arrangements by their families. Sixvictims were been buried in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
