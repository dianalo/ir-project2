 According to the show'ssponsor, H.A.andP;  Bruno, there were approximately five times as many attendeesand exhibitors--requiring 15 times the floor space--than six years ago.andM;More than attendance figures have changed at PC Expo.andP;  As with most industrytrade shows, networks of all sizes have become the focus of the showgoers'attention.andP;  Companies struggling to stay in the black in a PC-saturatedmarket are introducing networking products for users disgruntled by thelimitations of their standalone machines.andP;  Once a novelty, the LAN is now acenterpiece.andM;Nowhere was that more evident than at the Connections Lab, a multi-vendorundertaking sponsored by Business Systems Group, a Houston systemsintegrator, and LAN Times, to demonstrate the networking capabilities ofvarious hardware platforms, operating systems, and applications.andP;  Althoughthe Connections Lab's display was visually confusing, causing some of the 54participants to complain privately, it was technological achievement.andP;  Inother words, it approximated a real-life network.andM;The Connections Lab emphasized LANs, with hosts, minis, PCs, and Macintoshesconnected over Ethernet, Token ring, and Arcnet within the main booth.andP;  Thelab's designers also added wide area networking capability, using fiber andbroadband to connect the network in the main booth with a remote booth.andP;  Itfeatured a NetFrame multiprocessor server, two IBM 9371 hosts, an AS/400, andan RS/6000 RISC workstation running AIX, IBM's implementation of Unix.andM;Network operating systems running on various hardware platforms and takingadvantage of the various topologies included Novell NetWare, Banyan VINES,Apple A/UX, Microsoft LAN Manager, DCA 10Net, and Atlantix CocoNet.andO;Applications demonstrated at the Connections Lab included e-mail andmessaging, image processing complete with a scanner, tape backup, printspooling, and menu systems.andM;The Connections Lab was organized into eight functional areas: e-mail SQLdatabase servers, and Ethernet, IBM, LAN Manager, NetWare, and Token Ringconnectivity.andP;  For example, any user could send mail to any other user,regardless of their local e-mail system, thanks to an X.400 gateway fromTouch Communications and an MHS gateway from Novell.andP;  Database servers fromOracle, Gupta, Microsoft, and IBM were also internetworked.andP;  DB2 ran on the9371; the other databases ran on PC servers.andM;Adapting to HumansandM;The fabled paperless office probably will never exist.andP;  Instead, companiesare finding ways to incorporate paper into the electronic system.andP;  Documentprocessing is becoming widespread and standards-based.andP;  As computers andpaper meld into a single system, instead of forcing users to adapt to the waycomputers operate, many vendors at PC Expo emphasized that their productsadapt to the users.andM;One of the show's highlights was Coordination Technology's (Trumball, Conn.)andO;much-ballyhooed release of its groupware venture, Together.andP;  Based onCoordination TEchnology's co-founder founder Anatole Holt's science ofcoordination mechanics, Together is an electronic environment for organizingco-workers.andP;  User's projects are organized into various desktops, which canalso be shared with co-workers, allowing a company to define its ownrelationships and hierarchies among its users.andM;Together lets you structure workgroups according to how they actually work,not according to how a software developer thinks you should work.andP;  Groups areconnected by projects or tasks.andP;  Together provides the users the informationneeded to accomplish these tasks.andP;  Together lets team members stay abreast ofother's progress.andP;  And it makes it simple to assign tasks, collaborate onideas, and distribute information to others.andM;Together is based on OS/2, making it a high-end solution for thoseorganizations with the resources to invest in OS/2.andP;  A starter kit for 10users is priced at $9,995.andM;Imara Research (Toronto, Ont.) introduced what it says is the firstaffordable desktop image processing software for OS/2.andP;  A five-user systemcosts $2,495.andP;  The Imara system combines fax, scanner, and text data into onenetwork system.andP;  Although made of high-tech components, including OS/2Presentation Manager, LAN Manager, and Structured Query Language, ImaraResearch says it was careful to follow the way people really work.andP;  Insteadof forcing users to learn a new system, Imara mimics the paper-based system.andO;It stores documents, folders, and notes.andP;  Also, documents can be linked, sochanges made to one document are made to all linked documents.andM;Integrated fax and electronic mail lets users spool hundreds of faxes ormaintain up to 32,000 mail items, and allows users to attach images to theirmail or fax messages.andM;SQL allows users to query the system by form or key words.andP;  And with as manyas 40 million pages that can be supported on one system, some sort ofdatabase querying is definitely required.andP;  With OS/2's multitaskingcapabilities, users can have multiple documents open simultaneously.andP;  Thesystem is capable of handling large images without additional dedicatedmemory and runs concurrently with other programs.andP;  The Imara server can runon OS/2 and LAN Manager, LAN Server, or 3+Open, or NetWare with SQL Server.andM;Folio (Provo, Utah) was on hand, showing its Views infobase product.andP;  You areprobably familiar with Folio, only you don't realize it.andP;  If you've everasked for HELP on a NetWare LAN, you have run Folio's PreViews.andP;  PreViews isthe read-only search software.andP;  Views is the read-write (or author) version.andM;Views lets you create an &quot;info-base&quot; or database of documents.andP;  Views indexesevery word in the text and then compresses it to about half the originalsize.andP;  Users can then search for words of phrases.andP;  Words can be linkedtogether so information can be cross referenced.andP;  Unlike most search andretrieval packages, Views indexes all words, not just key words so you cansearch for any word.andP;  Information can be annotated, edited, and appended.andM;Views is an excellent way to put manuals online, whether help manuals or acompany's policy and procedure manuals.andP;  Folio even has a special legalversion of Views.andP;  Instead of lugging around bulging briefcases and boxes,important case information can be contained in a laptop, which travelsnicely--especially in a courtroom.andP;  Legal Views sells for $995.andM;Meridian Data (Scotts Valley, Calif.) updated CD Net, which makes CD-ROMdrives available to network users.andP;  Version 3.0 uses several featuresborrowed from the hard disk world to speed up access time.andM;CD Net employs read-ahead algorithms that try to anticipate users's requestsfor data.andP;  CD Net also caches up to 7MB of data, allowing retrieval at fullnetwork bandwidth.andP;  With the new multitasking capability, a user can accessmultiple CD-ROM drives.andP;  Users can assign each CD-ROM disk a drive letter,too.andM;CD Net also features a simplified installation procedure and allows managersto access diagnostic data from any network node.andP;  The system is compatiblewith Novell NetWare, Ungermann-Bass Net/One, 3Com 3+Share and 3+Open, and IBMPC LAN Program.andP;  Each unit integrates up to 14 drives, allowing for a totalof 9.3GB of information.andP;  CD Net starts at $7,995 for a single-drive,286-based system.andP;  Version 3.0 is available to existing CD Net customers for$69.50.andM;Applied Business Technology (New York) announced it will integrate anautomated methods and project estimating tool with its project managementsoftware, Project Workbench.andP;  The Project Bridge system is a knowledge-basedmethods and project estimating tool for the software engineering environment.andM;Users can produce project estimates based on &quot;function points&quot; as well as theapplications built-in estimating factors.andP;  The system provides users with arange of project kits and guidelines for selecting the appropriate kit basedon project type, size, and risk.andP;  It then creates a fully resourced andestimated plan, applying actual results obtained from the Project Workbenchsystem to re-estimate the remainder of the project.andP;  The Project Bridgesystem is priced at $5,000.andM;Informix Software (Menlo Park, Calif.) announced that Wingz, its graphicalspreadsheet package, is available for Windows 3.0 and OS/2 PresentationManager.andP;  Users can now combine text, number, three-dimensional graphs andimported images on one page with a single tool.andP;  Wingz for Windows and OS/2will be made available in a single bonus package.andP;  Both the Windows andPresentation Manager version cost $499.andM;Hardware AdvancesandM;Processor-powerhouse Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) let PC Expo attendees peerinto the future for a glimpse of its microprocessor in the year 2000, theMicro 2000.andP;  Intel is committed to increasing the chip's computing resourcesa hundredfold, it says.andP;  Demonstrations included advances in human interfacetechnology, enhanced memory capabilities, parallel processing, and embeddedprocessors in peripheral systems.andM;ATandamp;T continued its push in the computer industry with the release of twonetworking packages, the DOS X-terminal Solution Package and the GraphicsWorkstation Solution.andP;  The DOS X-terminal Solution Package lets userssimultaneously run Unix and DOS applications in a multitasking desktopenvironment.andP;  The package is comprised of an ATandamp;T 6386SX/EL Workgroup System,MS-DOS, PC Xsight software, and PC/TCP software running over a StarLAN 10Network Access Unit.andP;  The DOS X Terminal Solution costs $5,400.andM;The Graphics Workstation Solution provides high-performance graphics andnetworking capabilities for applications such as business graphics, networkmanagement, and financial analysis.andP;  Bsed on the ATandamp;T 6386/25 WGS, thepackage provides a 19-inch color monitor for high-resolution graphics, UnixSystem V Release 3.2.2, Open Look graphical user interface, and WIN/386TCP/IP software, and a StarLAN 10 Ethernet 100 Network Access Unit.andP;  TheGraphics Workstation Solution costs $18,700.andM;Alpharetta, Ga.-based DCA introduced a 10Base T-compliant family of LANproducts.andP;  In addition to the 10Net network operating system, DCA nowprovides 10Base Twisted Pair, a group of products that includes what DCA saysis the first concentrator to support fiber-optic media.andM;The product line consists of an ISA adapter board, a concentrator, and atransceiver.andP;  Each product can be used together or combined with othervendors' 10BaseT products.andP;  Future adapters will support Micro Channel PS/2s.andM;DCA says the adapter is compatible with Cabletron and Synoptics 10BaseTproducts and may be used with DCA's Secure LAN and IRMALAN gateway servers.andO;Drivers are available for DCA, Microsoft, 3Com, and Novell network operatingsystems.andM;The concentrator is built with 10 copper ports and one fiber port.andP;  Whentwisted pair is needed, the new transceivers are used.andP;  The twisted-pairadapter is priced at $425, the concentrator costs $2,200, and the transceiversells for $195.andM;In addition to the new product line, DCA is also unbundling 10Net hardwareand software and making 10Net software available under a licensing program.andO;New hardware prices will range from $249 to $475.andP;  Under the new softwarelicensing program, 10Net software will cost $149 for a single user and $5,000for up to 100 users.andM;Network Software Assoc.andP;  (Laguna Hills, Calif.) released a new version of itsLAN-to-mainframe gateway, Adapt-SNA Gateway.andP;  The gateway now providescomplete SNA 3270 emulation, requiring 58KB--less, the company says, than anyother product offering 3270 emulation at the workstation level--on the localworkstation.andP;  NSA reduces network traffic and gateway bottlenecks thoroughits Distributed Intelligence Network Architecture, whereby each workstationruns its own SNA program, instead of relying on a single dedicated gateway.andM;In 3270 mode, the gateway is IBM SAA/CUA compliant.andP;  The gateway alsosupports LU6.2 APPC and batch-oriented Remote Job Entry (RJE).andP;  It can beused on Token Ring or any NetBIOS-compatible LAN and supports SDLC, AutoSync,and 802.2 host connections.andP;  Each workstation runs the company's new3270/Elite software, which gives users a hotkey to DOS, keyboard mapping, andan OS/2 EE look-and-feel status line.andM;The gateway's new APPC features include basic conversation verbs, mappedconversation verbs, control verbs, high-level language interfaces, a learningand simulation package called Assist, and support for IBM's APPC/PCtransaction programs.andP;  RJE features include 3270 background and foregroundfile transfer, unattended operation and print-spooling.andP;  Pricing for theAdaptSNA Gateway starts at $995, based on the number of concurrentworkstations.andM;Sysgen (Milpitas, Calif.) introduced a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) drive forNetWare.andP;
