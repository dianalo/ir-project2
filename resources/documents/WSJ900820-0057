But Prime MinisterMahathir Mohamad's government sees just that.   Mr. Mahathir's ruling National Front has big plans todevelop the 78-square-kilometer island into a tax haven alongthe lines of Caribbean and European financial shelters thatenjoy low-tax regimes and minimal government regulation.</LP><TEXT>   Many analysts, however, say the plans may be too grand andthe rivalry among global financial centers too intense forLabuan to meet Kuala Lumpur's expectations in the nearfuture. They also note that the Asian-Pacific region alreadyoffers a plethora of tax incentives for investors.   The linchpin in efforts to transform the island is apackage of six pieces of legislation designed to spur aflurry of financial activity. They are expected to become lawsoon.   Supporters of the Mahathir plan note that Labuan isadvantageously located. Though air links are minimal, theisland is only several hours' flight from Hong Kong andSingapore. Proponents also expect Labuan to appeal to jitteryHong Kong executives and financiers seeking new legaldomiciles for their operations before China regainssovereignty over the British colony in 1997.   But skeptics argue that Labuan needs more than locationand investment incentives. They note the dearth oftelecommunications, travel, lodging, office and recreationalfacilities on the island, not to mention personnel. Labuan'spopulation largely lacks the education and training requiredto staff financial concerns.   In addition, financial and tax consultants citeinconsistencies and unspecified fees in the various bills.   &quot;I've told my clients to sit tight,&quot; says a Kuala Lumpurlawyer, who predicts that the hastily drafted legislativemeasures will undergo extensive revisions in the years ahead.   Many have faith, though. Arjunan Subramaniam, director oftax services for Arthur Andersen's Malaysian unit and anadviser to the government on the project, says, &quot;You have totake the first step; you have to begin somewhere. It'll takeabout 30 years to make it a fully developed tax haven.&quot;   Labuan was ceded to the central authorities in April 1984by the Sabah state government, then led by Chief MinisterHarris Salleh. Since that time, the federal government hasfaced increasing public pressure from East Malaysians to makesomething of the island. Ill-conceived industrial projectsunder the Harris administration have saddled Labuan withheavy debt, and its economy is largely dependent on thesocalled barter trade with Filipino merchants and others.   Mr. Mahathir opted to pursue the taxhaven route some fiveyears ago, consultants say. But it wasn't until he pressedthe relevant government ministries in November to draft thenecessary legislation by this year that the plans began totake shape.   Among other things, the bill stipulates that offshoreconcerns involved in so-called non-trading activities wouldpay no tax at all. Such activities are defined mainly asinvestments in securities, loans, deposits and immovableproperties, such as buildings. And as an inducement toattract professionals and contractors to Labuan, accountingand law firms, as well as construction companies, would haveonly 50% of their profits subject to Malaysia's 35%corporate-tax rate for the next five years.   Other inducements for offshore companies would includeexemption from stamp duties; no withholding tax on interest,royalties and technical fees; no tax on dividends tobeneficiaries and shareholders of the concerns; and relaxedrestrictions on the granting of multiple-entry visas toforeigners working for the concerns.   The legislation would also safeguard the secrecyrequirements of the banks' clients, a requisite of most taxhavens.   One part of the legislation, the Offshore Companies Bill,has been criticized as being cumbersome and time-consuming.The longest of the measures at 129 pages, the bill spells outthe incorporation, registration and administration ofoffshore companies in Labuan. Critics note that other taxhavens, such as the British Virgin Islands and the CaymanIslands, permit the registration of companies in about a day.They fear it would take several months to fulfill all theprovisions in the Malaysian bill.   Government consultants say the legislative package, with afew expectations, would meet the needs of companies andindividuals seeking a low-tax regime for certain operationsin Southeast Asia. But they caution that today'ssophisticated global telecommunications network also meansthat they can just as easily use other tax havens.</TEXT></DOC>
