Measurements of collisionally perturbed, complete spectral profiles,i.e. core plus line wings of the Na-D lines, at the highest possibletemperature in a fluorescence cell are reported. Both the shape of theprofiles obtained in these experiments and the temperature dependencegive information about the internuclear forces. Neon and xenon are chosenas perturbing atoms in order to extend and test potential shapes thathave emerged from earlier beam experiments. 2. Possible ways are discussedof accurately calculating the cross sections of all elastic and inelasticprocesses in a Na- noble-gas system for any likely shape of the potentialsinvolved. The main purpose of this discussion is to test these potentialsby comparing the calculated cross sections with experimental data. Alsoa detailed comparison is made of the measured far-wing profile and thequasi-static profile calculated using these potentials. 3. In order toassess the validity of the approximations made in the theoretical modelthat was used for calculating the fluorescence-excitation profiles, thepredictions of this model are compared with measurements of the polarizationand the intensity ratio of the collision-induced Na-D fluorescence andRayleigh scattering in an N{sub 2}-diluted flame at 1 atm pressure. Usingthe Utrecht High-resolution Fourier Interferometer in the visible range,the Rayleigh peak and the collision-induced fluorescence were separatedfor the first time at laser detunings within the absorption line width.263 references, 41 figures, 14 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
