European politicians and artists were among about 500 peopleattending the three-day meeting of the Federation for Democracy inChina, held at Sorbonne University.   Participants observed a moment of silence to honor pro-democracydemonstrators who died June 3-4 when soldiers marched on Beijing tocrush the student-led movement. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands,were killed.   ``No one will think of freedom or democracy or remember 1989without recalling the courage and strength shown by those people onTiananmen Square,'' said Paddy Ashdown of Britain's LiberalDemocratic Party, referring to the central Beijing square wherestudents staged pro-democracy protests.   ``What you have done has been an inspiration to us. What you willdo is a hope for the future,'' the lawmaker said.   Among those in the crowd were photographer Henri Cartier-Bressonand actor Yves Montand, who told reporters he came to support thebattle for human rights.   ``But how can they in exile?'' he said. ``The answer is likethis. This is the first chapter.''   During the meeting, prominent Chinese exiles _ including formerCommunist Party members, artists, intellectuals, students andbusinesspeople _ plan to establish rules for the federation. A mainoffice in Paris will have branches in North America and Asia.   Many of those involved say the federation could serve as thebasis for an effective opposition party to Communist rule in Chinaif conditions ever permit the exiles to go home.   Wan Runan, China's most influential independent businessexecutive until the violent suppression of the pro-democracymovement June 3-4, predicted the exiles will go home within 10 years.   ``We have a large number of elites among us with lots ofinfluence in China. We also have millions of overseas Chinese whoare uniting to support the movement,'' he said.   ``We can make a great impact on developments in China even thoughwe are in exile. We've left our traces in the system. The second weraise any issue there will be a lot of followers back home,'' Wansaid.   The federation hopes to mobilize more than 35 million Chineseliving in Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere to keeppressure on authorities in Beijing for economic and political reform.   ``Just as a company who desires success must satisfy itscustomers, so any political organization has to satisfy its people.In this belief we certainly have support,'' said Wan, who formerlyled the Beijing Stone Group computer company.   The company was a model for many of the quasi-independentcompanies set up under an economic reform program that has been introuble since last fall when the government announced austeritymeasures to combat inflation and excessive growth.   The federation will push for international economic sanctions tointensify China's economic difficulties and with that force thegovernment toward political change.   Chen Yizi, an influential adviser to ousted Communist Partyleader Zhao Ziyang and the most senior official known to haveescaped to the West after the crackdown, said economic conditions inthe country continue to deteriorate.   He said inflation in the first six months of the year ran at anannual rate of 35 percent in the biggest cities and 28 percentnationwide.   As China moves away from an economy that responds to marketforces and back to centralized control, wages will suffer, Chen said.   During the decade that Chen headed China's Institute for EconomicStructural Reform, one of three influential think tanks, per capitawages rose 260 percent for peasants and 70 percent for urban workers.   He predicted that under a return to centralized economy policies,China's gross national product would decline and consumer goodswould become scarce.   ``There is and will continue to be widespread dissatisfaction,''Chen said. ``The next decade will see fundamental changes in China.Within 20 years we will have a firmly established democraticprocess. And this federation will play a key role in that.''</TEXT></DOC>
