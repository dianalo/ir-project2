Part 791 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) establishesprocedures and criteria for initiating and reviewing claims of foreignavailability on items controlled for national security purposes.With this notice the Department is proposing to revise part 791 of theEAR. Comments from the public are desired concerning the proposed revisions.A person wishing to submit relevant information may submit it to OFA, Departmentof Commerce. OFA will carefully and fully consider all information received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The revision of the foreign availability regulations (part 791, EAR), isnecessary because of legislative changes to the program by the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, (the ``Trade Act''), and OFA's ownexperiences with the program. It is expected that this revision will improvethe Foreign Availability process and the effectiveness of the program,thereby enhancing national security and improving U.S. competitiveness.In September 1988, the Department published a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (53 FR 36007, September 16, 1989) thatamended the regulations by providing examples of evidence that claimantscould provide to support claims of foreign availability. That notice soughtpublic comment; however, the Department did not receive any. The Departmenthas, therefore, incorporated the list of examples of evidence into part791 of the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988</ITAG>The Trade Act significantly amended section 5 (f) and (h) of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979. The major changes were:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The creation of West-West foreign availability assessments both fordecontrol and for denied licenses (section 5(f)(2) (A) and (B) of the EAA);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The creation of an expedited licensing procedure for non-controlledcountries (West-West) based upon foreign availability (section 5(f)(5)of the EAA);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The establishment of new deadlines and the setting of consequencesfor failing to meet the statutory deadlines (i.e., automatic decontrolof the item) (section 5(f)(3)(B) of the EAA);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A requirement for the publication of both the initiation of an assessmentand the determination of foreign availability in the </ITAG><T4>Federal Register</T4> (sections 5(f)(3)(B) and 5(f)(9) of the EAA);<ITAG tagnum="15">_Different criteria for the different types of assessments (sections5(f) (1) and (2) and 5(f)(5) of the EAA);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The elimination of controls on items of equal or lower level of technologysimilar to items for which there is a finding of foreign availability (section5(f)(8) of the EAA); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A definition of foreign availability for controlled countries andmodifications of the definition for non-controlled countries (sections5(f)(10) and 5(f)(2)(B) of the EAA).</ITAG>The proposed regulations incorporate the above changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This proposed rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This proposed rule contains a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The Office of Management and Budget has approved thiscollection under control number 0694-0004. Public reporting for this collectionof information is estimated to average three hours per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to Office of Security and Management Support, Bureau of ExportAdministration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; andto the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0694-0004),Washington, DC 20503.3. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553, including those requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking,an opportunity for public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section13(b) of the EAA does not require that this rule be published in proposedform because this rule does not impose a new control.Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking andan opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these proposedregulations, the rule is issued in proposed form and comments will be consideredin the development of the final regulations.Written comments should be sent to: Dr. Irwin M. Pikus, Director of ForeignAvailability, Room SB-701, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Departmentof Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Washington, DC 20230.The period for comments will close January 8, 1990. The Department of Commercewill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing the final regulations. Comments received after the end ofthe comment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested personswho wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit thefullest consideration of their views.The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a requestthat part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of itsbusiness proprietary nature or for any other reason.The Department will return such comments and materials to the person submittingthe comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations.All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including writtenpublic comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communicationsmay be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published inpart 4 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

For a Controlled Country,such control or denial is ``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-factfrom foreign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining suchcontrol or denying a license would not be effective in restricting theexport of goods or technology which would make a significant contributionto the military potential of any other country or combination of countrieswhich would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States.If the Secretary determines that foreign availability exists, the Secretarywill decontrol the item or approve the license in question, unless thePresident exercises a National Security Override. (See andSection;791.7.)(b) <T3>Types of foreign availability.</T3> There are two types of ForeignAvailability:(1) Foreign Availability to a controlled country; and(2) Foreign Availability to a non-controlled country. (See andSection;791.7for delineation of the Foreign Availability assessment procedures, andandSection;791.6 for the criteria used in determininig Foreign Availability.)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;791.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Foreign availability assessment.</ITAG>(a) A Foreign Availability assessment is an evidentiary analysis that OFA(OFA) conducts to assess the foreign availability of a given item underthe assessment criteria. OFA uses the results of the analysis in formulatingits recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign availability existsfor a given item. If the Secretary determines that Foreign Availabilityexists, the Secretary will decontrol the item or approve the license inquestion, unless the President exercises a National Security Override.(See andSection;791.7.)(b) <T3>Types of assessments.</T3> There are two types of foreign availabilityassessments:(1) Denied License Assessment; and(2) Decontrol Assessment.(c) See andSection;791.8 for the evaluation of eligibility of an item forthe Expedited Licensing Procedures.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;791.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initiation of an assessment.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Assessment request.</T3> To initiate an assessment an applicant, claimantor Technical Advisory Committee must submit a Foreign Availability Submissionor a TAC Certification of Foreign Availability to OFA. Technical AdvisoryCommittees can only make certifications of foreign availability for controlledcountries. Any denied license applicant or a claimant can allege foreignavailability for either controlled or non-controlled countries.(b) <T3>Denied license assessment.</T3> An export license applicant whose exportlicense the Department of Commerce has denied, or intends to deny on nationalsecurity grounds may request OFA to initiate a Denied License Assessmentby submitting a Foreign Availability Submission within 90 days of denialof the export license. As part of the Submission, the claimant must requestthat the specified license application be approved on the grounds of foreignavailability. The evidence must relate to the particular export as describedon the license application and to the alleged comparable item. If foreignavailability is found, the Secretary will approve the validated license(or a request for reexport authorization) for the specific items, countries,and quantities listed on the application. The Denied License Assessmentprocedure, however, is not intended to trigger the removal of the U.S.export control on an item by incrementally providing a country with amountsthat taken together would constitute a sufficient quality of an item. TheSecretary will not approve on foreign availability grounds a denied exportlicense (or a denied request for re-export authorization) if the approvalof such license would itself render the U.S. export control ineffectivein achieving its purpose with respect to a particular country or countries.Moreover, the Secretary will determine whether on the bais of the DeniedLicense Assessment a Decontrol Assessment is warranted. If so, then OFAwill initiate a Decontrol Assessment.(c) <T3>Decontrol assessment. </T3>(1) Any claimant may at any time requestOFA to initiate a Decontrol Assessment by making a Foreign AvailabilitySubmission alleging foreign availability to any country or countries toOFA.(2) A TAC may request OFA to initiate a Decontrol Assessment at any timeby submitting a TAC Certification to OFA that there is foreign availabilityto a controlled country for items that fall within the area of the TAC'stechnical expertise.(3) The Secretary, on his own initiative, may initiate a Decontrol Assessment.(d) All Foreign Availability Submissions and Certifications are to be submittedto: Director, Office of Foreign Availability, Room SB 097, Bureau of ExportAdministration, Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW.,Washington, DC 20230.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;791.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contents of foreign availability submissions and technical advisorycommittee certifications.</ITAG>(a) All Submissions must contain at least:(1) The name of the claimant;(2) The claimant's mailing and business address;(3) The claimant's telephone number; and(4) A contact point and telephone number.(b) Foreign Availability Submissions and TAC Certifications should containas much evidence as is available to support the claim, including, but notlimited to:(1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to be comparable; (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S. technology; (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis for claimingthat the item is a non-U.S. source item;  (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics of the itemson which a qualitative comparison may be made;  (5) Non-U.S. sources's production quantities and/or sales of the allegedcomparable items and marketing efforts; (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control;  (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlled partsand components incorporated in the item alleged to be comparable; and (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact to the countryor countries for which foreign availability is alleged.  (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but is notlimited to, the following: Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures,operation or maintenance manuals; articles from reputable trade and technicalpublications; photographs; depositions based on eyewitness accounts; andother credible evidence. Examples of supporting evidence are provided inSupplmeent No. 1 of this part 791.  (d) Upon receipt of a Submission or TAC Certification, OFA will reviewit to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the beliefthat Foreign Availability may exist. If OFA finds the Submission or Certificationto be lacking in supporting evidence, the Office will request additionalevidence from the Claimant or Technical Advisory Committee. OFA will acceptthe Submission or Certification and will initiate the assessment when itdetermines that it has received sufficient evidence of that Foreign Availabilitysupporting the belief that Foreign Availability may exist. For Claimantand TAC Committee initiated assessments, the time for conducting the ForeignAvailability Assessment begins from the date of such determination.  (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreign availability assessmentcriteria delineated in andSection;791.6 of the EAR and the examples of evidenceset forth in Supplement No. 1 to this part 791 when assembling suportingevidence for inclusion in the Submission or Certification.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;791.6  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria.  </ITAG>(a) OFA evaluates the evidence contained in a Submission or Certificationand all other evidence gathered in the assessment process in light of certaincriteria that must be met before OFA can recommend a determination thatforeign availability does or does not exist. In order to initiate an assessment,a Foreign Availability Submission or TAC Certification should address eachof these criteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are:  (1) Available-in-fact,  (2) non-U.S. source,  (3) sufficient quantity, and  (4) comparable quality.  The criteria are defined in Section 791.1(d) of these regulations.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;791.7  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Initiation of an assessment. </T3>(1) Once OFA accepts a Submissionor Certification of Foreign Availability, OFA will notify the claimantthat it is initiating the assessment.  (2) The Bureau of Export Administration will publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice that it received a Submission or TAXCertification and initiated an assessment.    (3) The Bureau of Export Administration will publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of the initiation of any assessment.(4) OFA will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the intelligencecommunity, and any other departments, agencies and their contractors thatmay have information concerning the item on which OFA has initiated anassessment. Each such department, agency, and contractor shall provideto OFA all relevant information that it has concerning the item. OFA willinvite interested departments and agencies to participate in the assessmentprocess (See andSection; 791.7(e) for details).(b) <T3>Data gathering. </T3>OFA will seek and consider all available informationthat bears upon the presence or absence of foreign availability includingbut not limited to that evidence set out in andSection; 791.5 (b) and (c)of these regulations. As soon as Commerce initiates the assessment, itwill seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including an analysis ofthe military needs of a selected country or countries, technical analysis,and intelligence information from the Departments of Defense and State,and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly sought from industrysources worldwide; other U.S. organizations; foreign governments; commercial,academic and classified data bases; scientific and engineering researchand development organizations; and international trade fairs.(c) <T3>Analysis. </T3>OFA conducts its analysis by evaluating whether thereasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the foreignavailability criteria provides a sufficient basis for a recommendationfor a determination that foreign availability does or does not exist.(d) <T3>Recommendation and preliminary determination. </T3>(1) Upon completionof each assessment, OFA, on the basis of its analysis, recommends to theSecretary of Commerce that he make a determination either that there isor that there is not foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports.OFA's assessment upon which OFA based its recommendation accompanies therecommendation to the Secretary.(2) OFA will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the Secretarydetermine that foreign availability exists to a country when the availableevidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality is available-in-factto the country, from non-U.S. sources, in sufficient quantity so that continuationof the existing export control, or denial of the license application inquestion would be ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlledcountry, such control or denial is ``ineffective'' when comparable itemsare available-in-fact from foreign sources in sufficient quantities sothat maintaining such control or denying a license would not be effectivein restricting the export of goods and technology which would make a significantcontribution to the military potential of any other country or combinationof countries which would prove detrimental to the national security ofthe United States.(3) The Secretary makes his determination of foreign availability on thebasis of the OFA assessment and recommendation; the Secretary's determinationtakes into account the evidence provided to OFA, the recommendations ofthe Secretaries of Defense and State and any other interested agencies,and any other information that the Secretary considers relevant.(4) For all Decontrol and Denied License Assessments (pursuant to section5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a Foreign Availability Submission, theSecretary makes a preliminary or initial determination within four monthsof the initiation of the assessment, and so notifies the applicant. TheSecretary submits positive preliminary determinations for review to appropriatedepartments and agencies.(5) For self-initiated or TAC-initiated decontrol assessments there isno preliminary determination; the deadlines for self-initiated and TAC-initiatedassessments also are different than the deadlines for claimant-initiatedassessments (See andSection; 791.7(f) (2) and (3)).(e) <T3>Interagency review. </T3>Commerce notifies all appropriate U.S. agenciesand Departments upon the initiation of the assessment and invites themto participate in the assessment process. For claimant-initiated assessments,the Secretary of Commerce provides a copy of all positive recommendationsand assessments to interested agencies and departments for their reviewfollowing the Secretary's preliminary determination of foreign availability.For self-initiated and TAC-initiated assessments, the Secretary will provideall interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.(f) <T3>Final determination and notification. </T3>(1) For assessments initiatedby a Foreign Availability Submission (claimant assessments), the Secretarymakes a final determination of foreign availability for all Decontrol andDenied License Assessments no later than one month following his preliminarydetermination, and informs the applicant in writing. The Bureau of ExportAdministration submits for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice to the effect that:(i) Foreign availability exists, and(A) The requirement of a validated license has been removed or the licenseapplication in question has been approved; or(B) The President has determined that for national security purposes theexport controls must be maintained or the license application must be denied,notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate steps to eliminatethe foreign availability are being initiated; or(C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under COCOM, the U.S.Government will submit the proposed decontrol or approval of the licensefor COCOM review for a period of up to four months from the date of thepublication of the determination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (The U.S. Government may remove the validatedlicense requirement for exports to non-controlled countries pending completionof the COCOM review process.); or (ii) Foreign availability does not exist.(2) For all TAC Certification Assessments, the Secretary makes a foreignavailability determination within 90 days following initiation of the assessment.OFA prepares and submits a report to the TAC and to the Congress statingthat:(i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the requirementof a validated export license; or(ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has recommendedto the President that negotiations be undertaken to eliminate the foreignavailability; or(iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability.(3) For self-initiated assessments there is no established deadline fora foreign availability determination; however, the Department is committedto making and publishing the foreign availability determination for self-initiatedassessments within 6 months upon initiation of the assessment.(g) <T3>COMCOM review. </T3>When the Secretary determines that a COCOM-controlleditem is available to a controlled country, OFA submits the determinationto the Department of State, along with a draft proposal for the multilateraldecontrol of the item or for COCOM approval of the license. The Departmentof State submits the proposal or the license to the COCOM review process.COCOM has up to four months for review of the proposal.(h) <T3>Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. </T3>(1) The Presidentmay determine that an export control must be maintained notwithstandingthe existence of foreign availability. Such a determination is called aNational Security Override (NSO) and is based on the President's decisionthat the absence of the control would prove detrimental to the United Statesnational security. Unless extended (as described in paragraph (h)(7) ofthis section), and NSO is effective for six months. Where the Presidentinvokes an NSO, the U.S. Government will actively pursue negotiations withthe government of any source country during the six month period to eliminatethe availability.(2) There are two types of National Security Overrides:(i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from anassessment initiated pursuant to Section 5(f) of the EAA (claimant andself-initiated assessments); and(ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from anassessment initiated pursuant to Section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-certificationassessments).(3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the Presidentexercise his authority under the Act to retain the controls not withstandingthe finding of foreign availability.(4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the Presidentexercise his authority under the Act to retain the controls not-withstandingthe finding of foreign availability.(5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section5(f) of the EAA, the President will notify, in writing, the Committee onBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee onForeign Affairs of the House of Representatives that he has initiated therequired negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the nationalsecurity interest that necessitates the retention of controls.(6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section5(f) of the EAA, the Bureau of Export Administration will publish noticesin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of:(i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability,(ii) The President's decision to exercise the National Security Override,(iii) a concise statement of the basis for the President's decision, and(iv) an estimate of the economic impact of the decision.(7) The six month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to anadditional 12 months if prior to the end of the 6 months the Presidentcertifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and if hedetermines that the absence of the controls would continue to be detrimentalto the United States national security.(8) After the conclusion of negotiations, the Department of Commerce willretain the control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated.If foreign availability is not eliminated, the Department of Commerce willdecontrol the item by removing the requirement for a validated export licensefor the export of the item to the destinations covered by the assessment.To the extent that the negotiations are successful and the foreign availabilityis eliminated, Commerce will remove the validated license requirement forthe export of the item to any country that is party to the agreement toeliminate foreign availability.(i) <T3>Changes in foreign availability.</T3> If OFA becomes aware of conditions,including new evidence, that casts doubt upon a previous determinationthat foreign availability exists or does not exist, the Office of ForeignAvailability may review the evidence. If the Office finds that the foreignavailability previously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availabilitynot earlier found now does exist, the Office will make a recommendationto the Secretary of Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control.The Secretary of Commerce will make a determination, and the Bureau ofExport Administration will publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of his determination.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 791.8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Eligibility for expedited licensing procedures for non-controlledcountries.</ITAG>(a) OFA determines the eligibility of an item for Expedited Licensing Procedureson the basis of an evaluation of the foreign availability of the item.Eligibility is specific to the items and the countries to which they arefound to be available.(b) OFA will initiate an eligibility evaluation:(1) On its own initiative;(2) On receipt of a Foreign Availability Submission; or(3) On receipt of a TAC certification.(c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receipt of eithera Foreign Availability Submission or TAC Certification, the Bureau of ExportAdministration will notify the claimant or TAC of the receipt and initiationof an evaluation and publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of the initiation of the evalaution.(d) The criteria for determining eligibility for Expedited Licensing Proceduresare:(1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlledcountry from a foreign source;(2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S. controlleditem; and(3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlledcountry without effective restrictions.(e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary of Commercemakes a determination of foreign availability on the basis of the OFA evaluationand recommendation which takes into account the evidence the Secretariesof Defense, State, and other interested agencies provided to OFA and anyother information that the Secretary considers relevant. The Secretaryof Commerce will provide all interested agencies an opportunity to reviewand comment on the evaluation.(f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the Foreign Availability Submissionor TAC Certification, the Bureau of Export Administration will publishthe Secretary's determination in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> inform the Office of Export Licensing that theitem is/is not eligible for expedited licensing procedures to the statedcountries, and, where appropriate, amend Supplement No. 2 part 791.(g) Following completion of a self-initiated evalaution, OFA will notifythe Office of Export Licensing of the Secretary's determination and, whereappropriate, amend Supplement No. 2 to part 791. (Items exported to countrieslisted in Supplement No. 2 to 791 will be licensed in accordance with theprocedures in Section 770.14, except that the initial licensing actionwill be within 20 working days.)(h) Submissions and Certifications to initiate an Expedited Licensing Procedureevaluation must be clearly designated on their face as a request for ExpeditedLicensing Procedure purposes, must specify the items, quantities and countriesalleged eligible, and should be sent to: Director, Office of Foreign Availability,Room SB 097, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, 14thand Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20230.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 791.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations.</ITAG>Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according to the standardsand procedures set forth in 15 CFR part 789.

A claimantsubmitting evidence supporting a claim of foreign availability should reviewthis list for suggestions as evidence is collected.Acceptable evidence indicating possible foreign availability is not limitedto these examples, nor is any one of these examples, usually, in and ofitself, necessarily sufficient to meet a foreign availability criterion.A combination of several types of evidence for each criterion usually isrequired. A Foreign Availability Submission should include as much evidenceas possible on all four of the criteria listed below. OFA combines thesubmitted evidence with the evidence that it collects from other sources.OFA evaluates all evidence, taking into account factors that may include,but are not limited to: information concerning the source of the evidence,corroborative or contradictory indications, and experience concerning thereliability or reasonableness of such evidence. OFA will assess all relevantevidence to determine whether each of the four criteria has been met. Wherepossible, all information should be in writing. If information is basedon third party documentation, the submitter should provide such documentationto OFA. If information is based on oral statements a third party made,the submitter should provide a memorandum of the conversation to OFA ifthe submitter cannot obtain a written memorandum from the source.OFA will amend this informational list as it identifies new examples ofevidence.<ITAG tagnum="84">Examples of Evidence of Foreign Availability</ITAG>The following are intended as examples of evidence that OFA will considerin evaluating foreign availability.
