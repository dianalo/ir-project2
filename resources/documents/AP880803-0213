The United Transportation Union said it would strike at 12:01a.m. Thursday if Candamp;NW cuts the size of most of its train crews fromfour to two, a move that would eliminate the jobs of 1,156 brakemen.   The railroad, which moves freight on 6,400 miles of track in 10Midwestern states, said the walkout would disrupt at least some ofits freight operations and leave 40,000 Chicago-area commuterswithout rail service.   The Senate adopted a resolution Tuesday calling for a 36-dayextension of a cooling-off period in the rail dispute, but theHouse was not expected to consider the resolution until Thursdaymorning.   Mike Bushman, an aide to Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., a sponsor ofthe extension, said the House delayed action because of objectionsby Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and CommerceCommittee.   Bushman said Dingell had concerns about whether congressionalaction would be constitutional before a strike began.   ``But as it stands, we don't exect a strike to last long,''Bushman said. ``Hopefully, they will have legislation passed andsigned by the president in time to have commuter trains rolling forthe afternoon rush hour.''   Labor and management said they would honor any congressionalorder.   ``If Congress takes action, certainly we would abide by it,''said Donald Markgraf, the union's general chairman for Candamp;NWemployees, from his office at Wauwatosa, Wis.   Markgraf said the union will strike on schedule and expectsother unions to honor UTU picket lines.   ``Until the House takes action, we have to go on the assumptionthat we're going to implement our work rules and there will be astrike,'' spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said from Candamp;NW headquartersin Chicago.   ``We're going to try to run the railroad as efficiently as wecan,'' Ms. Cleveland said. ``Hopefully, it won't hurt traffic,especially if it's a very short-lived strike.''   ``If Congress were to act tomorrow, it would only last a day,''she said. ``But you can't really say what will happen, so we justhave to go ahead with our plans.''   In April, President Reagan issued an executive order barringeither side from taking action until 30 days after a presidentialemergency board submitted recommendations for a settlement.   The cooling-off period expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, but theSenate voted Tuesday to extend it until Sept. 9 to give the companyand the union more time to reach an agreement.   The presidential board recommended last month that Candamp;NW cut onebrakeman per train and that elimination of the second should bedecided through binding arbitration on a train-by-train basis.   Candamp;NW initially rejected the proposal but offered Monday toaccept it.   ``We felt Congress would probably implement (the proposal)anyway, and this would avoid a strike,'' Ms. Cleveland said. ``Butthe union doesn't want to accept this _ doesn't want to go halfway_ so we're prepared for the strike.''   She said the company would implement its original layoff plans,rather than follow the compromise proposed by the emergency board.   James Foote, a spokesman for the railroad's parent company, CNWCorp., said the railroad's commuter trains would not run Thursdayin the event of a strike.   But he said management personel would be used to operate enoughfreight trains to generate 80 percent of the company's usualfreight-hauling revenues on the first day of a strike.</TEXT></DOC>
