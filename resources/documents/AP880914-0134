(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The land heaved and windows brokemore than two miles away Wednesday when the Soviet Union detonateda underground nuclear bomb for the first American experts towitness a Soviet nuclear blast.   The Americans stood in a chilly wind on the barren test site atthe Forward Command Post Semipalatinsk Polygon about 1,700 milessoutheast of Moscow in the republic of Kazakhstan.   The wind blew the Soviet and American flags in the direction ofthe test range, far from the nearest settlement on the steppes ofSoviet Central Asia and a four-hour bus ride from the city ofSemipalatinsk.   As the shock wave rippled out, the ground shook and a low rumblebegan. Within moments of the 11 a.m. blast, a reddish dust cloudrolled above the spot where Soviet scientists planted a nucleardevice in a shaft drilled 642 yards into hard rock.   Some observers seemed a bit queezy from their proximity toground zero, only 2.4 miles away. Soviet observers watching asimilar test on Aug. 17 in Pahute Mesa, Nev., remained about 30miles from the blast site _ too far away to feel the impact. It wasthe first time Soviet experts were allowed to see a U.S. nucleartest and monitor it with their own equipment.   After Wednesday's test, the Soviet scientists quickly checkedtheir instruments and announced they had obtained the datanecessary to determine the force of the blast.   The information was gathered in a few millionths of a secondbefore the explosion destroyed the sensor cable buried a few yardsfrom the nuclear device. The Soviets and the Americans, whomonitored the blast with U.S. technology, have agreed to releasethe data within a month.   The blast was designed to have a force of 100 to 150 kilotons,about 10 times that of the atomic bomb the Americans dropped onHiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War II, but less powerfulthan the multimegaton hydrogen bombs detonated in the atmosphere atthe height of nuclear testing in the 1960s.   The Hagfors Observatory of the Swedish Defense ResearchEstablishment said the Semipalatinsk explosion measured between 50and 150 kilotons.   The joint experiment was the culmination of a ``dream for manyexperts who have spent their careers watching and studying theircounterparts from a distance,'' said C. Paul Robinson, the chiefU.S. negotiator at the Geneva talks on limiting nuclear tests.   ``We are extremely pleased,'' said Deputy U.S. Energy SecretaryJoseph Salgado Solgado. ``The experiment went very well for bothsides.''   Igor M. Palenykh, head of the Soviet observation team, said,``If the Americans had any doubt about our level of science andtechnology in a nuclear field, now they know.''   Both sides expressed confidence the test explosion would lead toratification of treaties limiting the size of underground nuclearblasts.   At a news conference in a trailer village that served as thecommand post for the test, Salgado said Wednesday's experiment andthe one like it in Nevada ``have demonstrated the effectiveness andnon-intrusiveness of CORRTEX,'' the U.S. technology developed togauge the force of nuclear explosions.   The Soviets, however, remain sceptical that the U.S. on-sitemeasuring system offers a long-term solution to the problem ofverifying nuclear tests.   Lt. Gen. Arkady D. Ilyenko, chief of the Semipalatinsk testsite, said it was too early to determine whether the Americanmethod was non-intrusive _ meaning it does not interfere with theblast or pick up other data the country doing the testing wouldlike to keep secret.   Ilyenko called for a continuing search for simpler, more precisemeasuring techniques.   Spokesmen for both sides agreed the experiments will speednegotiations in Geneva on verification protocols needed to ratifytwo treaties signed but not ratified in the 1970s that limit theforce of underground nuclear explosions. Robinson said the U.S.side still hopes the treaties can be ratified before PresidentReagan's term ends Jan. 20, 1989.   The treaties limit underground nuclear test explosions to astrength of 150 kilotons.   The two superpowers say they will abide by the agreements, butthe United States has said it will not ratify the documents untiladequate provisions are included against cheating and monitoringtechniques both sides could use to measure tests and verifycompliance, according to Robinson.   The talks on nuclear testing began in July 1986 and formalnegotiations started last November.      The Soviets support a complete ban on nuclear testing.Washington says the tests are necessary as long as nuclear weaponsexist, but want the number of nuclear explosions reduced in tandemwith arms stockpiles.</TEXT></DOC>
