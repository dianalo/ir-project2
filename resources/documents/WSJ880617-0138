Klaus Bretschneider, a Braunschweig state prosecutor, said Joachim Schmidt, the former manager of a Frankfurt currency broker, made the confession to authorities during questioning this week.    &quot;Mr. Schmidt has admitted to us that, in currency dealings with Volkswagen, he falsified forward dollar contracts in the name of the National Bank of Hungary to help cover up a bad currency position in early 1985,&quot; said the prosecutor, whose office is leading the investigation.    National Bank of Hungary, the country's central bank, last year refused to honor the contracts -- which called on the bank to buy dollars from Volkswagen at far above going market rates -- claiming it had no record of them. Mr. Schmidt's admission is likely to bear on Volkswagen's civil suit against the bank, in which the auto maker is seeking a court order for the bank to honor the contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
