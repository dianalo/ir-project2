Jim Walter accepted Kohlberg Kravis's sweetened $60-a-share bid at a board meeting late Wednesday night, nearly a month after Kohlberg first proposed to buy the Tampa, Fla.-based home building and building materials concern in a leveraged buy-out for $50 a share, or $2.03 billion.    But an official of PaineWebber, a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc., said that the New York-based investment banking firm Monday had offered $69 a share, or $2.8 billion, in cash and securities for Jim Walter. PaineWebber said it temporarily withdrew that bid after James Walter, chairman of the company, and several other Jim Walter officials told PaineWebber that they believed PaineWebber's offer was &quot;too aggressive&quot; and that Jim Walter management wouldn't participate in the $69-a-share bid.    Based on the discussion with Mr. Walter and the other company officials, PaineWebber lowered its offer, and along with Jasper, Ala.-based Drummond Co., bid $62 a share, or $2.52 billion, late Wednesday. That offer, which was to be composed of $52 in cash and $10 of securities, was rejected in favor of the all-cash Kohlberg Kravis bid.    The bidding for Jim Walter was complicated by the fact that both the Kohlberg Kravis and PaineWebber offers are leveraged buy-outs: transactions that are financed heavily by borrowing and that give managers a significant stake in the company once it is taken private. For a leveraged buy-out to work, managers must be willing to take part. But they may be reluctant to do so if a company's debt load would be too much of a burden.    Shareholders and Wall Street executives have, in the past, voiced concern that there are inherent conflicts in the role played by a company's management in determining whether to accept a leveraged buy-out bid, and in choosing among competing offers. Managers may have a personal financial interest in selling a company as cheaply as possible because they will get an equity stake. Shareholders, on the other hand, would prefer to receive the most money for their shares.    &quot;The action of (Jim Walter) management raises disquieting questions as to whether they have sought to maximize shareholder value, as was their obligation,&quot; contended Joseph Flom, a New York takeover attorney who represented PaineWebber in its attempt to buy Jim Walter.    In Tampa, a Jim Walter spokesman wouldn't discuss the matter. &quot;People can say what they want, but we won't comment,&quot; he said. Mr. Walter himself and other top executives didn't return phone calls.    Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which was representing a special committee of Jim Walter directors who were evaluating buy-out proposals, said that &quot;several proposals&quot; were received from PaineWebber.    &quot;It was the unanimous recommendation of our personnel working on the transaction, and the unanimous decision of the non-management directors present at the board meeting, that the Kohlberg Kravis offer was substantially better than any other available proposal,&quot; Shearson's Mr. Waters said. He added that Kohlberg Kravis's proposal &quot;was more credibly financed&quot; than the other bids.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Jim Walter closed at $59.875, up $1.375.    Under its definitive buy-out pact, Kohlberg Kravis, a New York investment concern, will begin a tender offer by next Wednesday for all the shares outstanding of Jim Walter. The agreement also provides that Jim Walter shareholders will receive, whether or not they tender their shares, the next regular quarterly common stock dividend of 30 cents a share.    Jim Walter said that Kohlberg Kravis has secured commitments from &quot;two major banks&quot; to provide $1 billion of the necessary financing themselves and to form a syndicate of banks to provide an additional $1 billion.    Kohlberg Kravis is the largest leveraged buy-out firm in the nation. Among its recent deals are last year's $4.2 billion buy-out of Safeway Stores Inc. and the $3.64 billion purchase of Owens-Illinois Inc. earlier this year. In a leveraged buy-out, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Debt is later repaid with funds from operations and the sale of assets.    A spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis said that Mr. Walter would run the company after the buy-out is completed and that Jim Walter managers would hold a stake in the new concern. The spokesman declined to disclose how big the managers' stake will be.    A PaineWebber official said that Jim Walter managers would have been offered a 15% stake in the company under the PaineWebber proposal. Individuals familiar with Jim Walter said that company officials were concerned about, among other things, whether PaineWebber's financing was credible. One individual said that the initial, higher PaineWebber proposal &quot;raised questions as to were the cash flows there to support&quot; the price.    Jack Perkowski, director of investment banking at PaineWebber, said that Citibank and Canadian Imperial Bank had each agreed to lend $500 million for PaineWebber's buy-out proposal and to put together a syndicate of banks to provide an additional $1.5 billion in loans.    PaineWebber, Mr. Perkowski said, was prepared to invest $75 million of its own money as equity and to underwrite an issue of $675 million of subordinated debt. He said that seven senior officers from Citibank met with the Jim Walter board and the company's advisers Tuesday to discuss the PaineWebber financing package.    PaineWebber hadn't yet paid the banks for formal commitment letters promising the loans. But Mr. Perkowski said that PaineWebber assured Shearson Lehman that it would get commitment letters from the banks quickly if it believed that Jim Walter was willing to negotiate an agreement with PaineWebber.    Peter Fitts, a Citibank senior vice president, said that it was customary in competitive bidding for a bidder not to have a commitment letter prior to knowing that a takeover offer would be accepted. &quot;In a beauty pageant, no one asks for a commitment letter&quot; because of the hefty fees that must be paid to banks, he said. He added, &quot;We wouldn't have been involved if we weren't serious. I have better things to do.&quot;    Individuals familiar with the Jim Walter bidding also questioned whether the securities portion of the latest PaineWebber offer could really be valued at $10. &quot;They offered fourth-layer discounted junior subordinated debentures,&quot; one individual said.    But PaineWebber said it had suggested working with Shearson Lehman to come up with securities that all parties would agree had a value of $10.    Jim Walter also received a joint bid from Citicorp Venture Capital Corp., a unit of New York-based Citicorp, and closely held Drummond, a mining concern, according to individuals familiar with the bidding for Jim Walter. On Wednesday, when the two companies realized their bid was lower than PaineWebber's, Citicorp and Drummond officials contacted PaineWebber to suggest that they team up.    PaineWebber then accepted Drummond as a partner in its proposed $52-a-share offer for Jim Walter.    Jim Walter builds low-priced homes, for which it also provides mortgage financing. It also makes building materials and pressure pipes, distributes paper, sells jewelry, and has interests in mining, gas and oil. In the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1986, the company had net income of $138.6 million, or $3.71 a share, adjusted for a recent stock dividend, on revenue of $2.37 billion.    Mr. Walter, who owns about 532,000, or 1.3%, of the 40,556,000 shares outstanding, is considered by industry analysts a smart and diligent manager.    The initial, higher PaineWebber bid had been structured as a merger proposal, while the later bid was fashioned as a tender offer. Mr. Perkowski said PaineWebber changed the structure of its offer Wednesday because Jim Walter directors had said repeatedly that they would prefer a tender offer because shareholders could collect their money faster.    Tender offers can be completed in as few as 20 days. Mergers, however, can take as long as three months or more to complete, because they require that the company send out proxy statements to shareholders and that holders vote.    The value of the higher PaineWebber offer would therefore have to be discounted to account for the time it could take for shareholders to be paid. But Wall Street executives said that the $69-a-share offer would still be significantly higher than the $60-a-share Kohlberg Kravis tender offer proposal that Jim Walters accepted. </TEXT></DOC>
