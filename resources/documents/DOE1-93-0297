The measurement of thesetrace gaseous and particle contaminants by instrumental methods is oftenlimited by instrumental sensitivity and by the interferences of othercontaminates that coexist with the species of interest. An example ofthis problem is the measurement of NO{sub 2} by chemiluminescence methods.This report describes a new denuder system and denuder coating arrangementthat eliminates interferences between oxides of nitrogen species andimproves the reliabilty and precision of measurements of HNO{sub 3} andHNO{sub 2}. This paper also describes the physical properties and samplingcharacteristics of an annular denuder system tailored for visibilitystudies and presents results of measurements made to demonstrate precisionand accuracy of data obtained with the annular denuder system.</TEXT></DOC>
