The amendment would make the following changes in accordance with the licensee'sapplication for amendment dated March 10, 1989. The amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to changethe testing frequency of the Turbine Steam Stop and Control Valves frommonthly to yearly. This test frequency is determined by the methodologypresented in WCAP-11525, ``Probabilistic Evaluation of Reduction in TurbineValve Test Frequency,'' and is in accordance with the established NRC acceptancecriteria for the probability of a missile ejection incident at Indian Point3 (1.0andmultiply;10^4 per year). The amendment would also revise the Technical Specifications to eliminatethe requirements on the turbine independent electrical overspeed protectionsystem (IEOPS). The IEOPS is a redundant turbine overspeed protection system.Both of the above changes will result in a reduced risk of unplanned planttrips. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestedinvolves no significant hazards considerations. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significantincrease in the probability of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The license evaluated the proposed changes against the standards in 10CFR 50.92 and has provided the following analysis:<ITAG tagnum="21">For the reduced testing frequency of the Turbine Steam Stop and ControlValves: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The previously referenced Topical Report WCAP-11525 evaluates theprobability of turbine missile ejection for the purpose of justifying areduction in the frequency of turbine valve testing. The WCAP evaluationshows that the probability of a missile ejection incident for turbine valvetest intervals of up to one year is significantly less than the establishedNRC acceptance criteria for generating a turbine missile from an unfavorable-orientedturbine. (This acceptance criteria was established by the NRC for IP-3at 1.0andmultiply;10^4, as stated in an NRC letter to J. C. Brons of theNew York Power Authority, dated February 26, 1987.) The small change inthe probability of generating a turbine missile with longer turbine valvetest intervals therefore does not represent a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of adifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment reduces the frequency at which turbine valvesare tested. Reducing the frequency of turbine valve testing does not resultin a significant change in the failure rate, nor does it affect the failuremodes for the turbine valves. Therefore, the proposed amendment does notcreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted in Response (1) and as shown in WCAP-11525, this change tothe Indian Point 3 Technical Specifications will not result in a significantreduction in the margin of safety for turbine missile ejection. The probabilityof missile ejection remains acceptably small and within guidelines establishedby the NRC Staff. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the elimination of the IEOPS: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The results of the WCAP-11525 evaluation demonstrate that the probabilityof missile generation due to overspeed is dominated by valve-related failuresand that the probability of missile generation due to overspeed is wellwithin the acceptance criteria for this event. These conclusions are madewithout taking any benefit for IEOPS. Further, the study demonstrates thatthe impact of IEOPS on reducing the probability of turbine missiles dueto overspeed is minor at best. As such, this proposed change does not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This application seeks to delete LCOs and surveillance requirementsapplicable to IEOPs. The IEOPs serves as a backup turbine overspeed tripdevice. The elimination of the IEOPs will not vary or affect any plantor turbine operating condition or parameter. As such, the proposed changedoes not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Does the proposed amendment invove a significant reduction in amargin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The total probability of missile ejection due to turbine overspeedand running speed is 2.62 x 10^5 yr. ^1 which is below the acceptance criteriaof 1.0 x 10^4 yr.^1. The fault tree modeling and quantification identifiedvalve failures as dominating the missile ejection probabilities. The IEOPShas only a minor impact on reducing the probability of overspeed. The probabilityof missile generation at overspeed conditions is sufficiently low thatthe elimination of the IEOPS will not result in a violation of the 1 x10^4 yr. ^1 missile ejection acceptance criteria. As such, this proposedchange does not involve a significant reduction in a marging of safety.</ITAG>Based upon the above, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the TS changesproposed for Indian Point 3 involve no significant hazards considerations.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Comments should be addressed to the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attn: Docketing and ServiceBranch.By May 30, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspects(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendments under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards considerations. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the request for amendment involves nosignificant hazards considerations, the Commission may issue the amendmentand make it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearingheld would take place after issuance of the amendment.If a final determination is that the amendment involves significant hazardsconsiderations, any hearing held would take place before the issuance ofany amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards considerations. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions arefiled during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to Robert A. Capra: petitioner'sname and telephone number; date petition was mailed; plant name; and publicationdate and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle,New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the petition and/orrequest, that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of good causefor the granting of a late petition and/or request. That determinationwill be based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated March 10, 1989, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC and at the Local Public Document Room, White PlainsPublic Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph D.
