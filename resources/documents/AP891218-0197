SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the 20th time since the founding of therepublic, your government is setting out to learn something abouteach of you _ and quite a lot about many of us.   Where do you live? How old are you and what's your race? Are yousingle, married or living with an ``unmarried partner''? How big isyour house, what's it worth and is it paid for?   Yes, it's time once again for a new decade and another census.   Even now, massive printing presses are churning out the morethan 100 million forms that will be needed to count over 250million Americans April 1.   Originally required as a count of the population to help divideup seats in the House of Representatives, the census has become aneffort to assess the state of the nation.   The debate about what to ask in 1990 has been under way for mostof this decade. Since 1984 there have been 65 public meetingsaround the nation to get the public's comments and suggestions.More than 5,000 people attended.   Suggestions that the Census Bureau ask people about theirreligion, their pets and their sexual preference come up often _and are rejected every time.   A proposal to ask about citizenship, in an effort to determinethe number of illegal aliens, was also not included on the shortform intended to enumerate everyone living in the United States.Few people in this country illegally would be likely to admit asmuch to the government, officials said.   In choosing what to ask, census officials considered the needsof government agencies, tried to repeat as many questions aspossible from the past to maintain consistent statistics andrealized that asking too much would result in people refusing tocooperate.   Indeed, the Office of Management and Budget, complaining of a``paperwork burden'' for the public, fought a battle wth the CensusBureau over some of the questions.   The bureau produced a 150-page study justifying the questions itis asking. After finding little support for some of the informationcollected the last time, the agency has dropped questions aboutmarital history and home air conditioning.   Most homes will receive the form in the mail in late March andare expected to mail it back after April 1. Census takers will goonly to some rural homes and to other places from which the mailedforms were not returned.   As in 1980, when mailed forms largely replaced census takers,the Postal Service will deliver forms to more that four out of fivehomes in the country, based on address lists purchased fromcommercial firms and compiled by the Census Bureau. Census takerswill go to areas where no adequate address lists could be obtained.   Over the years, hundreds of federal programs have developed thatdisperse money and projects on the basis of census statistics, andthus need specific information collected every 10 years.   Welfare programs and highway funds, job training and masstransit projects, education and urban renewal all depend on thecensus for raw data.   Simple pride results in some data being kept when statisticianswant to drop it.   This time, for example, the Census Bureau wanted to leave ablank for people to write in their ethnic group if they had checkedoff ``Asian or Pacific Islander'' under race.   In 1980 that question offered a list of possible Asian andPacific Island groups and a check-off box beside each.   Members of Congress representing areas with many Asians andPacific Islanders didn't like the proposed change and got a billthrough Congress to restore the 1980 style. So, in April, thecensus form will have a list of check-off boxes for such groups asChinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, AsianIndian, Samoan and Guamian as well as the write-in space for folkswho don't fit any of those categories.   The end result is two census forms, just as in 1980.   One form will be sent to every home in the nation _ more than106 million. That form contains seven questions about individualsand seven about housing.   One household in six will receive a long form, which amounts toa massive random sample of the nation.   Besides the questions on the short form, the long one asks 26more about individuals and 19 more about housing.   The personal questions include ones dealing with ancestry, workand income; the housing questions include ones asking aboutplumbing, telephones and building age.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Dec 19</NOTE></DOC>
