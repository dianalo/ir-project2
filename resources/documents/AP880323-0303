Sales of foreign-made cars are reported at the end of the month.   Domestic sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4million for the mid-March period.   That would indicate a decline from the industry's 7.1 million indomestic sales in 1987. For the prior 30 days, however, sales ranat an 8.1 million seasonally adjusted annual rate.   ``It looks like sales are beginning to drop back down to a moreexpected level,'' said Chris Cedergren, auto analyst at J.D. Powerandamp; Associates in Westlake Village, Calif.   Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at the Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said sales surged prior to the mid-March period asconsumers reacted to incentives and made purchases put off due tocaution after the October stock market crash. ``Now it is going tostart to settle down,'' she said.   Industry leader General Motors Corp. sold 92,173 domesticallymade cars in the March 11-20 period, down from 105,438 in thecomparable 1987 period. The daily sales rate was off 1.7 percent.   Ford Motor Co. auto sales of 54,186 were down from 67,672 in theyear-earlier period, and down 9.9 percent on a daily basis.   Chrysler car sales jumped to 30,801 from 31,699 in the sameperiod in 1987, up 9.3 percent on a daily sales basis, aided bystrong sales of Chrysler New Yorker and Landau luxury models, thecompany said.   Chrysler's domestic light truck sales jumped even more, totaling24,691, up from 20,987 in the year-earlier period and up 32.4percent in daily sales.   It was the eighth straight period of rising car sales atChrysler, said Tom Pappert, group vice president for sales. ``Weare clearly going into the spring selling season with momentum onour side.''   GM also was a gainer in truck sales with an eight-day total of45,376, up from 43,515. The daily sales rate was up 17.3 percent.
