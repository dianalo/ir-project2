But the leader of the United Transportation Union called theannouncement a ploy and said the union had no plans to meet withthe company to discuss the job cuts, which would take effect Aug. 4.   A three-member emergency board, appointed by order of PresidentReagan under the Railway Labor Act to head off a threatened strike,has recommended a non-binding compromise that would allow CNW'srailroad subsidiary, the Chicago andamp; North Western TransportationCo., to eliminate nearly 700 jobs.   Further job reductions would be decided on a case-by-case basis,under the recommendation made Friday.   But Chicago-based CNW expressed disappointment Tuesday in thepanel's suggestion, saying it ``does not go far enough towardsolving the problem of archaic work rules that require the NorthWestern to retain obselete, unproductive brakeman jobs.   ``If the recommendation were accepted, the North Western wouldstill be required to retain approximately 500 brakeman jobs whichno longer have any function and would spend approximately $25million each year for unproductive labor costs,'' the company saidin a statement.   CNW's plan to eliminate virtually all the brakeman jobs on itsfreight trains _ cutting the crew size from four to two workers inmost cases _ would save the company $53 million a year, saidspokesman Fred Bloedorn.   Bloedorn said technological advances of the past 100 years haveeliminated many of the brakeman's traditional duties.   But the union contends elimination of the jobs would violate itscontract and insists that no cuts be made.   Although the proposed job reductions apply only to CNW's freightlines, both the union and railroad said a strike would haltcommuter service.   CNW said it expected to meet with the union within the next fewdays under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. But unlessthe UTU offers concessions ``substantially beyond the emergencyboard's recommendation,'' the company said it would implement itsjob-reduction plan on Aug. 4, immediately after the end of a 30-daycooling-off period.   ``As far as I'm concerned, that's just a ploy by the carrier,''UTU General Chairman Don Markgraf said in a telephone interviewfrom his office in Wauwatosa, Wis.   He called the presidential panel's recommendation ``adisgrace,'' and said CNW ``got everything imaginable from theemergency board.''   When asked whether the union planned to meet with the company,Markgraf replied: ``Nobody's contacted me.''   President Reagan appointed the emergency panel on April 20,after the National Mediation Board said a union walkout coulddeprive several Midwestern states of essential transportationservice.   CNW is the eighth-largest U.S. railroad, based on revenue, andhandled nearly 1.5 million carloads of traffic in 1986. It alsoprovides the primary daily rail service for about 40,000Chicago-area commuters.</TEXT></DOC>
