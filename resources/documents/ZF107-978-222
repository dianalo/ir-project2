The information that comes out of thesesystems is what business decisions are made from,&quot; and the database system isresponsible for maintaining the purity of that information, Rousseau said.andM;Codd's rules ensure that information in a database is kept uncorrupted, andthese rules were developed from the concepts of relational algebra.andP;  Thistheoretical underpinning is what object-oriented databases sorely lack,Rosseau said.andP;  Objhect-oriented database designers cannot guarantee thattheir databases will remain clean, she said.andM;The primacy of object databases &quot;is not inevitable.andP;  ...  There is a largehistory of medium-sized software projects becoming disastrous large softwareprojects&quot; that cannot be handled by the object-oriented model, added JimStarkey, president of Interbase Software in Bedford, Mass.andM;&quot;The [object-oriented model] was a turkey in 1966, and it's a turkey in1989,&quot; he said.andP;  The object-oriented model is too difficult to control withlarge projects, and &quot;when application drift occurs, [object databases] becometotally untenable.&quot;andM;Even some supporters of object-oriented systems concede there are someshortcomings to their approach.andM;&quot;The mathematical foundations have not been spelled out for object-oriented[database management] very well,&quot; but that will not hurt its commercialsuccess, said Don Williams, Gemstone program manager for Alameda, Calif.'sServio Logic, which developed the Gemstone object-oriented databasemanagement system.andM;Object's FlexibilityandM;Object-oriented databases are an excellent choice for data structures thatare not handled easily by the relational model.andP;  The bill of materials list,where component parts create ever-bigger aggregates which themselves can benew data items, is one example that object proponents use to show thistechnology's flexibility.andM;Similarly, object-oriented databases' freedom from both primary keys andfield values to access data items makes them a good choice for geographicalinformation systems, which typically do not rely on numerical data fields toorganize their information.andM;But users shouldn't expect relational database vendors to be left behind byobject-oriented technology.andP;  Ingres has announced a front-end product for itsdatabase that adopts object-oriented methods.andP;  Oracle officials say they areheaded in an object-oriented direction as well.andP;  Data General has adopted anobject version of SQL that sits atop a generic relatinal DBMS.andM;But to extend a relational DBMS fully into the object-oriented world requires&quot;relaxing the data-type constraints imposed by classical relationalproducts,&quot; a Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said.andM;These constraints prevent relational databases from handling digitized voiceand image data, unless implemented through the non-standard &quot;blob&quot; data typeprovided by some vendors to accommodate user-defined, uncommon data types.andO;The relational &quot;blob&quot; can accommodate data items of varying lengths and thatappea devoid of information until translated, for example, by a graphicsfront end.andM;An Oracle spokesman said relational databases will adopt object technology&quot;as a superset of relational, so users can move smoothly into [theobject-oriented] world.&quot;andM;&quot;The migration will not be the sort of wrenching migration that users wentthrough&quot; when they began to move their data from hierarchical and Codasyldatabases into relational engines, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
