The dispute involves Japanese import quotas on 10 categories of agricultural products. After a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade upheld a U.S. complaint that the quotas violated international trade rules, Japan in November proposed to remove quotas on all but two of the categories. When other GATT members subsequently backed the U.S. position that all the quotas should be dismantled, Japan blocked the adoption of the panel's report. That prompted a threat of retaliation from the Reagan administration.    Now, according to the trade official, the U.S. has agreed to accept continued quotas on starch and powdered skim milk, but under GATT procedures will work out with Japan compensation for the restrictions. Japan, meanwhile, will lift quotas on the remaining items, according to the U.S. trade official, as it previously proposed to do. Those items are processed cheese, lactose, dairy preparations, sugared food preparations, processed beef, tomato juice, tomato sauce and ketchup.    While it will remove an irritant to trade relations between Washington and Tokyo, the dismantling of some of the import barriers involved in this dispute will have little impact on the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Some U.S. government economists estimate that it will mean less than $100 million in increased U.S. sales to Japan, barely denting a trade deficit that totaled about $50 billion in 1986 and is expected to have neared that total in 1987.    Japanese press reports suggested the impact could be even smaller. Several newspapers reported that the Japanese government may be considering replacing the quotas with a system of tariffs or taxes that would have much the same import-restricting impact. Such an arrangement, similar to ones used by European countries to protect their agricultural sector, would be legal under international trade rules.    &quot;They could rig up some sort of mechanism,&quot; said the U.S. official. &quot;It probably wouldn't go over too well in the U.S.&quot;    The import restrictions are an explosive issue in Japan, where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party relies heavily on farmers' votes. Massive demonstrations against the lifting of restrictions have been staged in rural areas and in the heart of Tokyo.    To forestall more anger, the Japanese government is trying to keep a lid on its decision. Indeed, Japanese government leaders are still busy trying to build support among politicians and various sections of the government for the controversial decision, the U.S. official said. No public comment has been made yet. &quot;Opposition to lifting the quotas is strong,&quot; said a Japanese government official.    The government could make an announcement on the matter later this month, when Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita visits the U.S. But sources in the Japanese government said that any announcement would be more likely to come very quietly next month before the GATT panel in Geneva, Switzerland.    It could be an expensive decision for the Japanese government, which may have to increase farm subsidies in order to retain the support of farmers.    The resolution of this dispute also may have implications for other trade disagreements between Washington and Tokyo, including negotiations over Japanese restrictions on beef and citrus imports. Removal of those restrictions would open the way for U.S. sales that could approach $2 billion yearly, U.S. trade officials have said. </TEXT></DOC>
