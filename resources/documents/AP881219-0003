The value of Japan's actual assets _ its land and structures _rose 20.2 percent to $3.04 trillion last year, while its GNP was$2.87 trillion, said Economic Planning Agency chief Eiichi Nakao.   Last year's soaring prices made land assets in Japan, a countryroughly the size of California, worth 4.1 times as much as all theland in the United States, Kyodo News Service said. In 1986,Japanese land value was calculated at 2.5 times that of the UnitedStates.   Financial assets such as equity and deposits also rose, to $23.2billion _ a 15.6 percent increase over 1986, the agency said.   ``Rapid rise in land prices and booming stock trading'' fueledthe explosion of assets, agency officials said.   Urban land prices have stabilized somewhat in recent monthsfollowing a series of measures by the central and local governmentsto control the spiral, but prices continue to rise in fast-growingsuburbs.</TEXT></DOC>
