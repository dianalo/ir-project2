 Todaysubscribership is close to 1 million, and big corporations arebecoming interested again, although there are lingering doubts asto whether consumers will consider the investment in equipmentworthwhile.andP;  Prodigy, a joint venture of IBM and Sears, will besold in retail stores and will feature consumer services such asshopping, product reviews, and banking, in addition to moretraditional offerings such as airline reservation services.andP;  Themainstays of today's services, however, are games andinterpersonal communications, much like those offered by Minitel,the French government-sponsored system.andP;  Many technologicalshortcomings must be overcome before videotex becomes widelypopular, and the overall key may be for its promoters to discoverwhat it does best and concentrate on that.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     VideotexMarket Analysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Videotex ReduxandM;Welcome to the morning of the information age.andP;  The newspaper arrives soppingwet.andP;  The toll-free line for the airline information you need is busy, busy,busy.andP;  And the kids spill juice on your last clean shirt.andM;With a burst of beeps and clicks, your PC logs on to your personal onlineinformation service, and suddenly all the problems seem manageable.andP;  Out comethe new items you were concerned about.andP;  Up pops a page of expert tips onstain removal.andP;  After browsing through the flight schedules, the neighborhoodcrime report, and the kids' lunch menus, you mark and move $200 from savingsto checking.andP;  Power off, and your errands are complete.andM;Welcome to .andP;  .  .  not 2001, but 1983.andP;  The Knight-Ridder newpaper chain hasjust introduced Viewtron, the first American attempt at delivering news,banking, shopping, and other interactive services via computer--and one ofthe most spectacular failures in the history of the media business.andM;Three years and $50 million later, the newspaper chain pulled the plug on theservice, discrediting predictions that what was starting to be called&quot;videotex&quot; would transform society.andP;  The menus had been unwieldy, thescrolling too slow, and the dedicated terminals too expensive.andP;  But most ofall, people didn't seem to need videotex.andP;  As the novelty wore off, usage ofeverything except online games and electronic mail dropped off.andP;  AndKnight-Ridder was not alone in defeat; the Times-Mirror Company lost bigmoney on a similar service that used television sets as display terminals.andM;Burned once, big media backed away, and videotex became a dirty word, spokenin hushed tones by true believers and a few strategic planners.andP;  While theFrench pushed ahead with their Minitel--a government-sponsored informationsystem--American videotex limped along.andP;  The only survivors were twohobbyist-oriented online database services, CompuServe and The Source, whosededicated core of subscribers would seemingly do anything online, justbecause it was online.andP;  (For more about CompuServe, The Source, and otheronline database services, see &quot;Dialing for Data,&quot; PC/Computing, November.)andM;Lingering DoubtsandM;Vladimir Zworykin, generally credited with the invention of television, usedto love to tell how his boss, the head of Westinghouse, berated him forwasting time tinkering with picture tubes and insisted he &quot;go work onsomething useful--like radio.&quot; Zworykin quit Westinghouse and went to RAC,where he introduced his brainchild.andM;The original videotex proponents have yet to be as thoroughly vindicated, buttheir prospects are looking better.andP;  Thanks to the business world's suddencraving for online services like research databases, modems and the know-howneeded to use them have spread rapidly, and more people have begun tinkeringwith online systems from their homes.andP;  The original hobbyist-oriented onlineservices have broadened their base and, together with newcomers  like Delphi,QuantumLink, and GE's GEnie, have brought total U.S.andP;  videotex subscribershipclose to 1 million.andM;Suddenly, big corporations are getting interested again--investing hundredsof millions in what they see as a way to get people to buy more PCs and spendmore time on the telephone, and to jockey for position in the onlinemarketplaces of the future.andM;This year will see the debut of several major videotex efforts, including anew generation of easier-to-use, graphics-based systems.andP;  IBM and Apple, inwell-financed partnerships with retailers and software companies, areoffering services.andP;  And the seven &quot;Baby Bell&quot; telephone companies, aftergetting the go-ahead from a federal judge, are weighing in with local&quot;gateways&quot; that will offer easy one-stop access to a range of existinginformation services.andM;Critics say that getting even sophisticated PC owners to try videotex will bean uphill battle.andP;  Technical obstacles aside, doubts linger as to whetherconsumers will think videotex worthy of the necessary investment inequipment, fees, and patience.andP;  Nonetheless, the era of corporateskittishness over videotex seems to be ending.andP;  Says Gary Arlen, industryanalyst and publisher of the newsletter Interactivity Report: &quot;It's the beastthat won't die.&quot;andM;Great White Plains HopeandM;Leading the pack of new videotex efforts in bucks, if not bang, is thecompany some experts call &quot;the great White Plains hope,&quot; New York-basedProdigy Services, a joint venture of IBM and Sears.andP;  After gobbling up arumored $400 to $500 million and gathering a staff of more than 900, Prodigyhit the streets of Hartford, San Francisco, and Atlanta last summer with avideotex service promoted as an efficiency booster--a way to eliminatelaborious trips to the bank, the travel agent, and the shopping center.andM;&quot;Every successful enterprise is shaped by a vision of the future,&quot; says thecompany's literature.andP;  Prodigy's vision is that of harried two-careercouples, squeezed for time between child-rearing and caring for a growingelderly population.andP;  Prodigy, which identifies its biggest competitor as &quot;thetraditional way people do things,&quot; will supposedly give these individuals&quot;better options for organizing and enriching their lives ...andP;  evolving from asimple life-style adjunct today into the preferred method for handling manydaily activities in the 1990s.&quot;andM;The Prodigy startup kit comes packaged like perfume, in a colorfulorigami-like collection of glossy boxes within boxes.andP;  This and othertrappings of slick consumer marketing, such as splashy monthly magazines forsubscribers, are the hallmarks of the latest round of videotex newcomers.andO;Prodigy will be sold through retail stores, as will the AppleLink videotexsystem for Apple IIs and Macintoshes, which Apple developed with QuantumComputer Services, and PC-Link, a pull-down menu service for DOS machinesthat Quantum developed with the Tandy Corporation.andM;In addition to standard videotex fare like newswires, airline reservationservices, and market updates, Prodigy is emphasizing consumer services likeshopping (including grocery-ordering), product reviews, and banking.andP;  Userscan place orders from the Sears and J.C.andP;  Penney catalogs, or read columns byand send personal questions to a bevy of experts, from Gene Siskel on moviesto Jane Fonda on fitness and nutrition.andM;Prodigy's onscreen appearance is as close to the newspaper and TV genres aspossible.andP;  &quot;Did you know that Sears is having a catalog white sale?&quot; asks abulletin at the bottom of one &quot;page.&quot;andP;  &quot;Your daily horoscope according toJeane Dixon,&quot; cues another, &quot;Don't make a move till you read it.&quot;andM;&quot;It's kind of like watching the national news,&quot; says Richard K. tenEyck,telecommunications director for the Boston Computer Society.andP;  &quot;It's full ofnicely digested sound bites,&quot; he explains.andP;  &quot;You hit the high points, and ifyou want to go deeper, you can.&quot;andM;According to tenEyck, Prodigy's slick approach will succeed in spreadingvideotex beyond the core of heavy computer users and into the middle-Americamainstream.andP;  &quot;They're focusing on people who have very little perceived needfor computers in their everyday lives,&quot; he says.andP;  To reach these people,Prodigy is planning over $20 million worht of direct mail, print, andtelevision ads over the next 15 months in trend-setting California, where thecompany has chosen to make its full-blown debut.andM;Games and E-mailandM;Ironically, though Prodigy's plan had been to sell videotex on the strengthof time savings and efficiency, its market tests confirmed what the managersof the older online services knew all along: what subscribers love most isplaying online games and sending little messages back and forth to eachother.andM;The initial Prodigy users clamored for more games like CEO--where onlineplayers could set up companies and compete against each other in fictitiousindustries--and for electronic bulletin boards for sharing ideas andinformation on specific topics.andM;Log on to GEnie, CompuServe, or most other established systems, and itquickly becomes apparent that games and interpersonal communication, not truevideotex, are the meat and potatoes of today's online services.andP;  Multiplayerinteractive games with names like Mega Wars, Hunt the Wumpus, and ADFL(Advanced Digital Football League) share center stage with conferences andforums where users post remarks on topics ranging from child care to COBOL,for all to see and respond.andP;  Also popular is the uploading and downloading offree and user-supported software.andM;&quot;People want services that matter to them,&quot; says Richard Koch, founder of aregional videotex service called Boston CitiNet.andP;  &quot;More people use theFurball Forum [CitiNet's conference for cat lovers] than the AP wire.&quot;andM;The latest sensation in online services is the CB Simulator, a collection of&quot;channels&quot; where users ham it up in what amounts to a text-only conferencecall.andP;  Their comments appear in sequence seconds after they are typed, as inthe following conversation from one of CompuServe's chat channels.andM;SparkPlug: what's everybody up to?andM;King of Hearts: hi whiteandM;TOPAZ: hello whiteandM;SparkPlug: hey white ...andP;  are your undies fruit of the loom or maidenform?andM;zig: he allandM;King of Hearts: time to catch zzz ...andP;  night all!andM;WHITE UNDERWEAR: fruitandM;Participants can break off and &quot;go private&quot; with a conversation at any timeand can even send one another digitized pictures of themselves for display onhigh-resolution monitors.andP;  Each CB Simulator has its own Who's Who update(Cupcake's Society Column on CompuServe, Muffy's Gossip Corner on GEnie) topost obituaries and announce weddings and to give advice on online etiquette.andM;These new &quot;CB&quot; channels are a thinly disguised take-off on the FrenchMinitel's &quot;messageries&quot;--highly successful chat services that transformedthat system from a lackluster online telephone directory into a smorgasbordof interactive services with over 3 million terminals in homes and publicplaces.andM;Criticized until recently as a porno-laden government giveaway, Minitel isfinally getting some respect on this side of the Atlantic.andP;  Conceived in1978, it was the upshot of a government report that warned that the Frenchwould miss the information age unless they were somehow forced out of theirtraditionally technophobic shells (at the time, only one in three Frenchhomes had phones, which had historically been considered instruments ofwomen's liberation and political subversion).andP;  The government began by givingaway Minitel terminals containing electronic phone directories and charginghefty prices for paper copies of the phone book.andM;Ten years later, Minitel is the method of choice for finding certain types ofinformation, such as train schedules, and its messageries have sparked asocial phenomenon that draws comparisons to the Paris salons of the 1700s.andM;&quot;It's as if you are communicating directly with a person's sould,&quot; said oneFrench official in a recent Atlantic Monthly article, pointing to the lack ofaudio or visual cues in videotex.andP;  Though the messageries have been calledthe emotional equivalent of safe sex, they are not always so safe for allinvolved.andP;  The Atlantic article told of a man who cut the Minitel wiresbecause he suspected his wife of starting an affair online.andP;  She splicedthem.andP;  &quot;So many have gone out the window, we have stopped counting,&quot;according to the French official.andP;  &quot;Put a Minitel in a bad marriage and it'sover.&quot;andM;Grassroots MovementandM;In the absence of French-style government intervention, videotex in Americahas grown into a spaghetti-like jumble of systems, services, and networks,shaped by factors ranging from grassroots tinkering to long-distancetelephone prices.andM;On the humblest level are the thousands of bulletin board systems (BBSs) thatrun on PCs in individuals' homes.andP;  Specializing in everything from AIDS tosurfing, these boards are often fly-by-night affairs.andP;  The fanciest, likethose operated by some of the larger PC user groups, can accommodate multiplecalls simultaneously.andM;More durable, but still in the grassroots vein, are the many noncommercialand nonprofit networks that offer videotex-like communictions services andrun on everything from souped-up BBSs to large university mainframes.andP;  Theseinclude political nets, such as PeaceNet and EcoNet, handicapped and elderlynets, academic nets, and worldwide &quot;meta nets&quot; such as USEnet and Internet,which connect the other nets.andM;In the commercial realm, there are regional systems like advertiser-supportedBoston CitiNet, free to its 40,000-odd users, and the Whole Earth 'LectronicLink (WELL) in Sausalito, catering to the Bay Area's technical andcounterculture communities.andP;  While their mostly local clientele makes themresemble overgrown BBSs, these systems have managed to attract some farawayusers who are willing to pay the long-distance phone charges.andM;National systems like CompuServe, QuantumLink, and GEnie lower thelong-distance barrier by providing users with local phone numbers and thenrouting their calls through so-called &quot;packet-switched&quot; networks.andP;  Thesehigh-volume data networks are cheaper and more efficient for computer callsthan voice networks like ATandamp;T and MCI.andP;  The nationals then fold thelong-distance charges into their fees, which range from a monthly flat rateof $10 for nighttime and weekend use to $15 or more per connect-hour ofdaytime use (not including start-up fees, 2,400-bps surcharges, orvalue-added services such as database searches).andM;Long-distance prices have played a major role in shaping the videotexlandscape.andP;  GEnie, which undercuts rivals with a $5-per-hour off-peak rate,was born when GE realized it could bypass long-distance costs by using itsown extensive corporate data network, which had excess capacity at night.andO;The local bulletin-board scene got a boost when Telenet, a commercial datanetwork, introduced its PC Pursuit service, offering unlimited nighttime andweekend computer calls to any of 34 cities, for a flat fee of $25 per month.andM;Concentrating on cultivating their own personalities and loyal followings,the nationals end up in a constant battle to out-clone one another in theirbrokerage of third-party services.andP;  The online shopping firm Comp-U-CardInternational, for example, can be found peddling its wares on severalnetworks, as can Dow Jones News/Retrieval, which provides market information,and American Airlines, supplier of the EAAsy Sabre flight reservation system.andM;As the videotex audience grows, so does the roster of third-party onlineinformation providers.andP;  New York-based Connected Education offersgraduate-level courses online.andP;  Charles Schwab and other firms provideinvestment services.andP;  A handful of banks let account holders move funds andpay bills online for an $8-to-$15 monthly fee.andP;  Godiva chocolates andlong-distance roses can be ordered on some systems.andP;  Side-by-side new-carcomparisons are available online, as are Peterson's College Guides, theMissing Children database, and the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.andP;  If you have ahigh-resolution display, you can even get their pictures.andM;Technological ShortcomingsandM;&quot;Membership services, how can I help you?&quot;andP;  A heavily accented New Yorker'svoice answers the Prodigy toll-free help line after two rings--a shock on acustomer service line, especially at 9 p.m.andP;  In the background, the dialingof modems can be heard over muffled dialogue and a radio or two tuned to theMets game.andM;The text frozen on the caller's screen reads, &quot;Help--A CommunicationsProblem.andP;  This is a Technical Problem, Not Your Error.&quot;andP;  The caller has justmoved to a new apartment and is suddenly having problems dialing up Prodigyand other services.andP;  The questioning begins.andP;  What make of modem do you have?andO;Do you have any special expansion boards in your PC?andP;  Are you hearing thedial tone?andP;  The whoosh-like connect sound?andM;Over the next hour, the usual suspects are eliminated by checking softwaresettings, rebooting from a floppy to bypass memory-resident programs, anddialing alternate access numbers.andP;  The caller hangs up after each remedy issuggested, plugs the phone line into the modem to try again, and then goesback to the phone to call in the results.andM;Finally, ready to play hardball, the troubleshooter suggests opening up thePC to remove a suspect serial card.andP;  Tired and unwilling, the caller optsinstead to admit defeat, agreeing with the service rep that the culprit ismore likely a &quot;noisy&quot; phone line that the PC's inexpensive internal modemlacks the circuitry to overcome.andM;&quot;There are few more hostile situations than trying to get someone online forthe first time,&quot; says BCS's Richard tenEyck.andP;  &quot;This is an industry that'streading on very thin ice with its audience.andP;  There are a lot ofmild-mannered people out there pounding on the sides of their terminals.&quot;andM;The reasons for the frustration are numerous.andP;  The low-budget videotexoperations of the past few years have produced systems that occasionallythrow hapless callers into endless loops or hiccup forth extremely crypticmessages such as &quot;Error opening UD--3:[ZD.X4LPW1500]MAIL .MAI.&quot;andP;  And just ashardware glitches have turned away potential users, mazelike menu systems andarcane command schemes have caused more than a few subscriptions to gounused.andP;  &quot;People have to be able to get a sense for what's out there andwhat's a waste of time without running up a huge bill,&quot; says tenEyck.andM;To help eliminate technical obstacles, many systems now offer front-endsoftware to simplify log-on and browsing, including scripts thatautomatically set the communications parameters (data bits, stop bits,parity) and enter the user's ID number and password.andP;  Prodigy's softwareactually maps out the user's equipment onscreen--showing where the modem isattacheD, for example, and which communictions port it's using.andM;Other technological shortcomings, such as slow response times and scrollingspeeds, stem from the limitations of existing equipment.andP;  For example,1,200-bps modems can't quite pump data fast enough to ward off creepingfrustration.andP;  Trying to read text scrolling choppily up the screen at thisspeed can be an eye-straining experience.andP;  Prodigy tries to handle theproblem by generating user profiles and &quot;prefetching&quot; frequently requestedscreens into RAM to make them instantly available when users ask for them.andO;And on Apple's AppleLink, thanks to the Macintosh's bit-mapped graphics, thetext glides, not bumps, calmly into view.andM;Bit-mapped and high-resolution graphics, however, are a long way frombecoming the norm for videotex.andP;  Most systems send and receive letters andnumbers only.andP;  While newcomers such as Prodigy and Quantum are offeringgraphics and elegant diagnostic features, critics such as Boston CitiNet'sRichard Koch charge that &quot;you need a water-cooled PC to use them.&quot;andP;  Kochadmits, however, that he's glad to have the competition--he thinks anysuccess will boost the prospects of the entire industry.andM;PCs or Dumb Terminals?andM;&quot;Absurd&quot; is the word Samuel Simon uses to describe the trend toward videotexsystems based on high-end PCs.andP;  Author of the book Phonewriting: A Consumer'sGuide to the New World of Electronic Information Services and arepresentative for U.S.andP;  Videotel, a company trying to sell Minitel-liketerminals here, Simon sees &quot;dumb terminals&quot; as the only way to get videotexoff the ground.andM;&quot;You've got to get somebody on it to be befuddled by it,&quot; Simon says oftoday's PC-based American videotex.andP;  &quot;We don't even have people on it.&quot;andO;Computers are not conducive to impulsive use, he claims, because they need tobe booted up, they're typically located in a remote part of the house, andthey're tricky to use.andM;&quot;If it's to be aimed at Joe Six-pack, it's got to be terminal-based,&quot; Simoninsists.andP;  He's not alone.andP;  In an attempt to replicate Minitel's success, BellCanada will begin a two-year trial period for a dumb-terminal-based systemcalled Alex in Montreal.andP;  In Houston, the regional telephone companySouthwestern Bell has reportedly contracted to purchase and co-market as manyas 20,000 dumb terminals in a joint venture with U.S.andP;  Videotel.andM;Robert L. Smith, Jr., executive director of the Videotex IndustryAssociation, agrees that eventually many Americans will use a device that's&quot;part PC, part telephone&quot; for videotex.andP;  The PC and telecommunicationindustries will develop this machine jointly, predicts Smith, pointing toQuantum's current ventures with Apple and Tandy (on AppleLink and PC-Link) asthe first step.andM;The videotex &quot;explosion&quot; he and others are expecting, however, will not occuruntil a greater depth and breadth of services can be cultivated, Smith says.andO;Local content like restaurant reviews and classifieds will be especiallyvital, he argues, along with government services like information about carregistration, radon testing, where to catch the bus, and &quot;whether the garbagewill be picked up on Columbus Day.&quot;andM;On France's Minitel, users can get same-day standardized educational testresults, apply for credit and get an answer within the hour, and retrievegovernment information about taxes and social security.andP;  Even the CatholicChurch has a service.andP;  In the United States, many innovative services havebeen tried--one experiment in Ohio even let users order pizza andvideocassettes for delivery at the same time--but they've never been put onthe same system.andM;&quot;The biggest challenge is how can all those different services beinterconnected,&quot; says Smith.andP;  &quot;Unlike France, we're not going to have theunifying force that's just going to connect everything ...andP;  we're going to bea multistandard country.&quot;andP;  And at least for the time being, he argues, thatwill lead to confusion, both for users and for companies that want to provideservices.andM;This was the reasoning that U.S.andP;  Judge Harold Greene, the man in charge ofthe Bell System breakup, acknowledged in September 1987 when he agreed to letthe regional &quot;Baby Bell&quot; phone companies provide gateways to onlineinformation services.andP;  Greene saw that the French phone company's involvementin Minitel ad legitimized online services there, encouraging a critical massof information providers to participate.andM;In the wake of Judge Greene's ruling, all seven regional phone companies arepressing ahead with plans for gateways consisting of a local phone number formodem owners to dial, an alphabetical menu of information providers (AmericanAirlines, CompuServe, and so on), and a few help screens.andP;  The phonecompanies are authorized to handle billing for the information providers andwill charge them several dollars for each hour spent on their service--a feethat will undoubtedly be passed back to users.andM;The phone companies' nightmare, however, is that once they have blazed thevideotex trail, other companies will be able to offer competing gateways andundercut their prices.andP;  In his ruling, Judge Greene withheld from the BabyBells what might have been their decisive advantage, the right to publishonline Yellow Pages telephone directories.andP;  In doing so, he sided with thenewspaper publishers who have long warned that the phone companies might usetheir financial and marketing power, and technological monopoly, to muscleout competing information providers andgateway providers.andM;In France, the turf war between publishers and the phone company was resolvedby an agreement to update online directories only once a year, so theycouldn't compete with print advertisements.andP;  Many such battles remain to befought in the United States, including traditional media controversies overaccess and editorial control, which, with a new technological twist, arebecoming contentious all over again,andM;Guarded OptimismandM;Skeptics predict that the latest round of videotext efforts will meet thesame fate as Viewtron and other early failures, laying a bad idea to restonce and for all.andP;  But the people involved with the projects are guardedlyoptimistic.andP;  NYNEX's gateway venture is code-named &quot;Operation Snowball.&quot;andO;Market research firms like Link Resources are plotting steady growth curvesfor the industry.andP;  Even the federal government is planning for a future withvideotex--the IRS is experimenting with electronic filing of tax returns.andM;Enthusiasts like CitiNet's Koch point to the recent explosion of &quot;audiotex&quot;(976 and 1-800 information lines) as evidence of America's insatiableappetite for information on demand.andP;  Each week in Chicago, he notes, over70,000 people pay 35 cents to call up and find out what the winning lotterynumber was.andM;Videotex wouldn't be the first new technology thrust suddenly into americansociety.andP;  Fax machines, CD players, mobile phones, answering machines--ageneration of information technologies has taken hold rapidly (by contrast,the telephone took seven decades to reach 50 percent penetration).andP;  Some ofthem, like fax, may both compete with and complement videotex.andP;  GEnie isplanning to offer delivery of its personalized daily news digests straight tosubscribers' fax machines.andP;  Other competing technologies, like cableTV--based shopping systems and standalone public information video kiosks,may simply increase public familiarity with videotex's format and services.andM;Marshall McLuhan wrote that people always fill new media at first with thecontent of the old.andP;  For videotex to really catch on, its promoters will needto figure out exactly what it does best.andP;  Until then, as Koch says, if  youtry to explain videotex to the average citizen, don't be surprised if &quot;theythink you're talking about opening up a video store.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
