In a surprising development, the leader of the Soviet Unioncalled on the summit chiefs to link his country's economy to theirown.   The extraordinary appeal became the principal subject ofdiscussion at the summit leaders' dinner meeting, according toFrench spokesman Hubert Vedrine. He called Gorbachev's lettertotally unexpected.   Aside from the Soviet leader's appeal, the economic summit was soharmonious the world leaders decided to end their three-day meetingseveral hours earlier than scheduled Sunday, the first time any ofthe 15 annual gatherings was cut short.   The letter from Gorbachev was read to the leaders by FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand. Gorbachev said it ``is obvious thatthe rest of the world can only gain by the opening to the worldeconomy of a market such as that of the Soviet Union.''   He petitioned the West to consider the reforms he is making inthe communist Soviet economy and to let his country play a largerrole in world economic affairs.   Any disputes that did occur among the leaders of the UnitedStates, France, West Germany, Japan, Britain, Italy and Canada wereeither papered over or ignored as the summit nations issued apolitical communique Saturday.   The second day of discussions was held on the 35th floor of theGrand Arch, an avant-garde marble and glass office building offeringa spectacular view of Paris.   Secretary of State James Baker, in a briefing for reporters,called his ninth consecutive summit ``the most harmonious and one ofthe most productive summits that I have attended.''   The rich nations were lavish in their encouragement for politicaland economic reforms in Poland and Hungary, but they did not back upthe kind words with any specific commitment of money.   But Bush indicated that he was pleased with the support providedby his fellow summit leaders, saying the commitments they made had``vindicated'' his approach to fostering economic and politicalreforms in the communist East bloc.   Bush attended the summit at the end of a history-making trip toPoland and Hungary, where he unveiled a $140 million package of aidto the two nations.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said that all of thesummit nations were ``very anxious to help. We are all helping, eachin our own way.''   The annual economic gathering was interspersed between the pompand pageantry of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.Mitterrand, who considers himself a champion of Third World causes,invited more than two dozen leaders of developing countries to rubshoulders with the Summit Seven during the festivities.   But the French president gave up an effort to get his summitpartners to endorse a call for a North-South summit between rich andpoor countries to address the economic plight of poor countries.   The summit will conclude Sunday with a round of meetings and theissuance of a final communique, expected to focus on such issues asThird World debt and a pledge to clean up global pollution.   At the urging of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the documenton political issues was amended Saturday at the last minute toinclude a proposal to convene an emergency meeting within the nextfew weeks to deal with the ``urgent need for food assistance'' forPoland.   Officials said the session could be used as the launching pad fora massive foodlift to shortage-plagued Poland.   European nations are currently stockpiling surplus meat, sugar,grain and some dairy products that could be used to ease theeconomic difficulties of the Poles.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, briefing reporters,said that it was envisioned that the conference would organize bothfood and cash contributions for Poland but it was unclear just howmuch food aid would be forthcoming.   The leaders also reaffirmed their support for easing Poland's $39billion foreign debt burden but skipped specifics on how muchrelaxation in the repayment schedule they were willing to finance.   On China, the seven democracies called on Beijing to ``ceaseaction against those who have done no more than claim theirlegitimate rights to democracy and liberty'' but the leaders stoppedshort of announcing any stiffer sanctions in response to the bloodycrackdown on dissent.   In his letter to the summit gathering, Gorbachev called forincreased East-West cooperation on economic matters saying suchlinks would prove beneficial to both sides.   ``Our perestroika (restructuring) is inseparable from the policytending toward full and entire participation in the world economy,''wrote Gorbachev.   The summit leaders, while not responding directly to Gorbachev'smessage, expressed their approval for easing East-West tensions butsaid Moscow ``remains a threat to each of us'' because of a militarybalance that favors the Communist bloc.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the Sovietletter was read by Mitterrand during the leaders' afternoon sessionand that the Bush administration was generally supportive ofGorbachev's proposals for greater economic coordination.   The leaders also condemned international terrorism and vowed tobring terrorists to justice.   They called for stepped up international efforts to protectagainst aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of the bombingof Pan Am flight 103 that killed 270 people in Lockerbie, Scotland,last December.   In a clear reference to Iran and its allies in Lebanon, theleaders called ``on those holding hostages to release themimmediately and unconditionally and on those with influence overhostage-takers to use it to this end.''</TEXT></DOC>
