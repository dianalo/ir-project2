(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The stone likenesses of four presidentscarved into a mountain at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial inthe Black Hills have made a cameo appearance in a Hitchcock filmand inspired President Reagan to recite a poem.   ``Mount Rushmore is not simply a tribute to four men, but ratheris a memorial to the ideas they represent,'' Rep. Tim Johnson,D-S.D., said at a ceremony last year celebrating the 50thanniversary of Abraham Lincoln's 66-foot face. ``Mount Rushmore isnot a place of stoic stone faces. It's a place of dreams.''   The monumental visages of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, can be seen for 60 miles.   Mount Rushmore is the No. 1 tourist attraction in South Dakota,with more than 2 million visitors a year. Custer State Park draws 1million people a year and ranks third in the state's $520 milliontourism industry.   Gutzon Borglum began work on the monument in 1927, but died in1941 shortly before it was completed. His helper and son, LincolnBorglum, finished the work.   The national memorial, which occupies 1,275 acres, is two mileswest of Keystone and about 20 miles southwest of Rapid City.Keystone was evacuated Wednesday night as a brushfire headed towardthe memorial, but the monument was reopened on Thursday.   The monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in``North By Northwest,'' Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1959 thrillerstarring Cary Grant.   It has also been the scene of protest. Last October, fivemembers of the environmental group Greenpeace were arrested whenthey illegally climbed Mount Rushmore and tried to unfurl a160-foot by 50-foot banner reading ``We The People Say No To AcidRain.''   In October 1986, Reagan was moved after flying over the monumentin Air Force One.   ``I may gaze on planets born of farther suns,'' Reagan recited.   ``I may greater glories one day see.   ``But today, dear Earth, how I love thee.''</TEXT></DOC>
