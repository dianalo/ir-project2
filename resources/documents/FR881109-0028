We have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission(ITC) of our determinations and have directed the U.S. Customs Serviceto suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandise from theUK as described in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our final determinationsby January 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>November 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gary Taverman, Mary Clapp, CaroleShowers, or Bradford Ward, Office of Antidumping Investigations, ImportAdministration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. 20230,telephone: (202) 377-0161, 377-3965, 377-3217, or 377-2239 respectively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Determinations</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that antifriction bearings (other than taperedroller bearings) and parts thereof (hereinafter referred to as AFBs orthe subject merchandise) from the UK are being, or are likely to be, soldin the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1673b) (the Act). Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. We also preliminarily determine that critical circumstancesdo exist with respect to imports of a certain class or kind of AFBs fromthe UK, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On May 17, 1988, the ITC determined that there isreasonable indication that U.S. industries are materially injured by reasonof imports of the subject merchandise from the UK (53 FR 18909, May 25,1988).On May 31, 1988, the Department presented Section A of the antidumpingduty questionnaires to INA Bearings Ltd. (INA), RHP Bearings Ltd. (RHP),SKF UK Limited (SKF), and Rose Bearings, Ltd. These companies account fora substantial portion of exports of the subject merchandise from the UKto the United States during the period of investigation. The remainingsections of the questionnaire were issued on June 15, 1988. Responses toSection A were due on June 14, 1988, and responses to the remaining sectionswere due on July 15, 1988.On July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandum stating that the subjectmerchandise constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise (<T3>see</T3>, ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice).In light of this decision, the Department re-examined the sufficiency ofpetitioner's less than fair value (LTFV) allegations for each class orkind of merchandise from the UK. The Department afforded petitioner anopportunity to provide additional information in support of its LTFV allegationsfor particular classes or kinds of merchandise where needed. On August1, 2, and 29, 1988, petitioner submitted additional data. We determinedthat petitioner provided sufficient information in support of the LTFVallegations for each class or kind of merchandise from the UK.However, we have only recently been able to identify an exporter of plainbearings from the UK, Rose Bearings, Ltd. (Rose). On October 21, 1988,a questionnaire was issued to Rose; responses will not be received untillate November. Given these circumstances, we consider it appropriate topreliminary determine that plain bearings from UK are not being, nor arelikely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.On July 15, 1988, the Department determined that these investigations areextraordinarily complicated in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)of the Act, and postponed the preliminary determinations until no laterthan October 27, 1988 (53 FR 27738, July 22, 1988).On August 8, 1988, we issued revised reporting requirements based on ourdecision to simplify these investigations (<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Accordingly, response deadlines were extended several times, with the finaldue date for responses being no later than September 6, 1988. A numberof supplemental questionnaires were issued subsequent to that date. Supplementalresponses were received from the respondents prior to these preliminarydeterminations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging the Torrington Company's standingto file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the groundsthat it was not filed by ``an interested party'' ``on behalf of'' the UnitedStates industry as required by section 732(b)(1) of the Act. Section 771(9)(c)of the Act defines ``interested party'' to include ``a manufacturer, producer,or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' With the exceptionof an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,'' the ITC categorizationof the subject merchandise into six like products is identical to the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations. Torringtonhas demonstrated that it produces all five classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer, producer or wholesalerin the United States of the like products under investigation, and is an``interested party'' with standing to file this petition.The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry.'' Section732(b)(1) of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases (<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February28, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia </T3>(50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985),the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the petition. The Departmentbases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor its legislativehistory restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiring that partiespetitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmatively that amajority of the members of the relevant domestic industry support the petition.The only requirement is that the party filing the petition act as the representativeof the domestic industry.When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorproportion of the domestic industry.In order to determine whether a major proportion of the domestic industryopposes the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of The Torrington Company. Responsesto the standing questionnaires are due on October 28, 1988. We will continueto examine the standing issue for purposes of the final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS) and all the merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date willbe classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Untilthat time, however, the Department will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions. Aswith the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The Department's written description of the products under investigationremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all petitions filed with the Departmentthrough the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.Additionally, all U.S. Customs offices have reference copies, and petitionersmay contact the import specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.For a complete description of the products subject to these investigations,see Appendix I attached to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise</ITAG>In our notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), we treated thesubject merchandise as one ``class or kind of merchandise.'' Subsequentto initiation, we received numerous comments from petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties in these investigations on whether the subjectmerchandise constitutes one or more classes or kinds of merchandise. Aftercareful consideration of all views expressed, and based on our discussionswith product experts at the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and within theDepartment, we issued a decision memorandum on July 13, 1988, stating thatthe subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kinds of merchandise,as follows:1. Ball Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Ball Bearings)2. Spherical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (SphericalRoller Bearings)3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Cylindrical Roller Bearings)4. Needle Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (NeedleRoller Bearings)5. Plain Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Plain Bearings)This July 13, 1988 decision memorandum is on file in the Central RecordsUnit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.38(a), the Department ``normally will examine atleast 60 percent of the dollar volume of exports to the United States fromany country subject to an antidumping investigation.'' Due to the enormousvolume of sales by respondents during the period of investigation and thecomplexity of identifying similar merchandise, we have attempted to reducethe reporting requirements for respondents while maintaining a reasonablebasis for our analysis. Accordingly, on July 15, 1988, we issued a letterto all interested parties requesting comments on two alternatives to ourstandard methodology. One alternative was to select at random a certainnumber of products sold in the United States and to compare the U.S. pricesfor those products with the home market prices of identical or similarmerchandise, as appropriate.The second alternative was as follows: if at least 33 percent by volumeof the respondent's U.S. sales could be compared to home market sales ofidentical products, then fair value comparisons would be limited to identicalcomparisons. If a respondent failed to reach the 33 percent requirementwith identical matches, then, in addition to identical comparisons, wewould compare the largest volume products sold in the United States tosimilar products sold in the home market within each class or kind categoryuntil the 33 percent threshold was met.After reviewing comments from interested parties on this issue, we selectedthe second alternative. The August 5, 1988 memorandum explaining the proceduresoutlined above is on file in the Central Records Unit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Production Allegations</ITAG>Based on information presented in the petition and supplemental submissions,on April 20, 1988, we initiated an investigation of sales at LTFV fromthe UK. At that time, we also initiated an investigation of whether salesin the home market were being made at prices below the cost of production(COP). As stated above, on July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandumstating that the products under investigation constitute five separateclasses or kinds of merchandise. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice.)Accordingly, on July 22, 1988, the Department requested that petitionersubmit evidence of sales at below the COP for each class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for which sufficient information had not been provided.In addition, several respondents objected to the Department's decisionto initiate COP investigations. Citing <T3>Al Tech Speciality Steel Corp. v. United States,</T3> 575 F. Supp.1277 (CIT 1983) (<T3>Al Tech</T3>), these respondents argued that petitioner's sales belowcost allegations were deficient because they were based on country-wide,rather than company-specific home market pricing data. After review ofthese comments, the <T3>Al Tech</T3> decision, and Section 773(b), on August 22, 1988, we discontinuedthe COP investigations, but allowed petitioner additional time to submitcompany-specific home market price information to substantiate its allegationsof sales at below the COP. The August 22, 1988 decision memorandum outliningour analysis of this issue is on file in the Central Records Unit. Petitionersubmitted such new allegations of home market sales below the COP.After analyzing petitioner's new allegations and the numerous supplementsthereto, we have determined that sufficient company-specific allegationshave been provided with respect to the following investigations:1. Ball Bearings_SKF2. Spherical Roller Bearings_SKF3. Needle Roller Bearings_INATherefore, the Department has reinstated COP investigations for these companieson the classes or kinds of AFBs listed above. Petitioner submitted on October21, 1988, a new allegation of sales below the cost of production for salesby RHP of ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings. The Departmentis currently reviewing this allegation and will make a determination inthe near future.<ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Respondents</ITAG>On July 1 and 7, 1988, we issued questionnaires to companies which hadexpressed interest in submitting voluntary responses in these investigations.On September 15, 16, and 19, 1988, we received a voluntary response fromCooper Bearings Ltd. (Cooper), a producer of cylindrical roller bearingsin the UK. This response was not timely as it was received after the finaldue date for questionnaire responses (September 6, 1988). This responsealso contained material deficiencies. Therefore, it was not consideredfor purposes of this investigation. Accordingly, cylindrical roller bearingsexported by Cooper will be subject to the ``All Other'' rate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>This period of investigation is October 1, 1987 through March 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether there are sufficient sales of the subject merchanidisein the home market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign marketvalue, we normally compare the volume of home market sales to the volumeof sales to third countries within each respective such or similar category.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed thematching criteria set forth in <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan,</T3> (52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, we sought and considered commentsfrom interested parties and consulted product experts at the U.S. CustomsService, the ITC, and within the Department. Given the enormous numberof products sold and the numerous physical permutations among bearing types,it would have been virtually impossible to determine home market viabilitybased on such or similar categories within each class or kind of merchandise.Therefore, home market viability was calculated based on home market andthird country sales of each class or kind of merchandise.Pursuant to our alternative reporting requirements, where 33 percent ormore of U.S. sales by volume were identical in all physical respects tohome market products, comparisons of similar merchandise were unnecessary(<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).In those instances where similar comparisons were necessary for a givenclass or kind of merchandise, we instructed respondents first to narrowthe pool of possible product comparisons by matching each of the followingcriteria: (1) Number of rows of rolling elements, (2) load direction, (3)bearing design, and (4) precision rating. Respondents were then to applya ten percent deviation test to each bearing in this pool of possible productcomparisons based on the (a) outside diameter, (b) inside diameter, (c)width, and (d) dynamic load rating to determine the most similar home marketcomparison.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from the UK to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements:1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent;2. This was a customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer.Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball BearingsA. <T3>RHP: </T3>RHP reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated purchase price and ESP based on packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions from purchaseprice and ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage and handling, foreign inlandfreight, foreign inland insurance, ocean freight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inlandfreight in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We made furtherdeductions from ESP, where appropriate, for advertising, commission, creditexpenses, and indirect selling expenses pursuant to sections 772(e)(1)and (2) of the Act. RHP has calculated its foreign inland freight, ocean freight, packing,and U.S. inland freight based on value rather than weight or volume. Wehave requested that RHP calculate revised allocation rates for these expensesbased on how their costs were incurred (<T3>i.e., </T3>by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of our preliminarydetermination, we have accepted RHP's allocation rates as the best informationavailable. RHP claimed advertising expenses incurred on its U.S. sales as an indirectexpense. For purposes of this determination and as the best informationavailable, we are treating advertising expenses as a direct selling expensebecause RHP did not clearly specify whether these expenses were directedat its customers or its customers' customers. B. <T3>SKF: </T3>SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling, duty, inland freight, marine insurance, and ocean freight, inaccordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions,where appropriate, for cash discounts and rebates. We made further deductionsfrom ESP, where appropriate, for credit, ``other expenses'', repackingexpenses in the United States, technical service expenses, warranty expenses,and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) ofthe Act. SKF claims that the category ``other expenses'' should be used as an adjustmentto its United States price to account for data entry and invoicing errors.The data included both positive and negative values. Given that SKF didnot provide any information regarding how this adjustment should be treated,<T3>i.e., </T3>whether it should be added or subtracted from United Statesprice, we added these expenses to United States price. II. Spherical Roller Bearings<T3>SKF: </T3>SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for sphericalroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings<T3>RHP: </T3>RHP reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated purchase price and ESP for cylindrical roller bearings basedon packed, delivered prices to unrelated customers. The adjustments wereidentical to those described above for ball bearings.IV. Needle Roller Bearings<T3>INA:</T3> INA reported that less than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market and did not providehome market sales of similar merchandise. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Lacking these comparisons, we have applied best information available forthose sales which would achieve the 33 percent threshold. We have usedthe margin calculated as best information available since this rate washigher than the rate provided in the petition for this class or kind ofmerchandise from the UK.All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse price to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling (which included containerization, marine insurance, ocean freight,U.S. inland freight and insurance), foreign inland freight, foreign inlandinsurance, and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.We made further deductions from ESP for credit expenses, warranty expenses,and U.S. indirect selling expenses and non-U.S. indirect selling expenses,pursuant to section 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act.For the following expenses, INA used the same allocation rates for U.S.sales of merchandise from INA-FRA, INA-France and INA-UK: brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, packing andnon-U.S. selling expenses. We have requested that INA calculate separateallocation rates, by country, for these charges. Also, INA has calculatedits foreign inland freight, ocean freight and packing based on value, ratherthan weight or volume. We have also requested that INA calculate revisedallocation rates for these expenses based upon how their costs were incurred(<T3>i.e.</T3>, by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of the preliminarydetermination, we have accepted INA's allocation rates as the best informationavailable.V. Plain Bearings<T3>Rose:</T3> As stated in the ``Case History'' section of this notice,given that we have only recently identified Rose as an exporter of plainbearings, and its response will not be due until late November, we havepreliminarily determined that Rose's sales of plain bearings are not beingmade at less than fair value.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales. The calculation of foreign market valuefor each respondent is detailed below.I. Ball BearingsA. <T3>RHP: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on packed, deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions formthe home market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing and rebates. We added U.S. packing to the home marketprice in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expensesand credit notes, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15. For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we made further deductions from home market price, whereappropriate, for credit expenses and credit notes. We also deducted indirectselling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home marketproducts used in fair value comparisons are identical to the products soldin the United States, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandisewere required.RHP calculated its home market freight and packing based on value ratherthan weight or volume. We have requested that RHP calculate revised allocationrates for these expenses based on how their costs were incurred (<T3>i.e.</T3>, by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of this preliminarydetermination, we have accepted RHP's allocation rates as the best informationavailable.B. <T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, home market packing,and rebates. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We also deducted certainindirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since allhome market products used in fair value comparisons are identical to theproducts sold in the United States, no adjustments for physical differencesin merchandise were required.SKF's response included a claim for home market ``indirect selling expenses''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, SKFfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of these indirect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination.II. Spherical Roller Bearings<T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for spherical roller bearingsbased on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. Theadjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings<T3>RHP:</T3> We calculated the foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on packed, delivered prices to unrelated customers in thehome market. The adjustments to home market price for comparisons involvingpurchase price and ESP sales were identical to those described above forball bearings.IV. Needle Roller Bearings<T3>INA:</T3> We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price for inland freight and inland insurance, and discounts.We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We also deducted indirectselling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home marketproducts used in fair value comparisons are identical to the products soldin the United States, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandisewere required.INA has calculated its foreign inland freight based on value rather thanweight or volume. We have requested that INA calculate a revised allocationrate for this expense based on how its costs were incurred (<T3>i.e.,</T3> by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of the preliminarydetermination, we have accepted INA's allocation rate as the best informationavailable.V. Plain Bearings<T3>Rose Bearings, Ltd.:</T3> Refer to ``Case History'' section of thisnotice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the UK. Section733(e)(1) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 733(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.We have determined in past investigations whether imports have been massiveby examining the Department's import data. However, because the Department'simport data pertaining to the subject merchandise are based on basket TSUSAcategories, we determined in these investigations that company-specificdata on shipments of the subject merchandise are the most appropriate basisfor our preliminary determinations of critical circumstances. Furthermore,we believe that company-specific critical circumstances determinationsbetter fulfill the objective of the critical circumstances provision ofdeterring specific companies that may try to increase imports massivelyprior to the suspension of liquidation. We have asked all respondents ineach of the AFB investigations to supply monthly volume shipment data fromJanuary 1986 through the present in order for the Department to base thecritical circumstances determinations on company-specific data. Based onour analysis of the monthly shipment data submitted by respondents, wehave preliminarily found that there is a reasonable basis to believe orsuspect that imports of cylindrical roller bearings from RHP have beenmassive over a relatively short period of time. Therefore, we find thatthe requirements of section 733(e)(1)(B) are met for RHP's exports of cylindricalroller bearings.SKF, however, has failed to provide the Department with adequate informationupon which to base a determination. Therefore, as best information available,we are assuming that imports from SKF have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time for spherical roller bearings. Therefore, we alsofind that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(B) are met for SKF andspherical roller bearings.We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by UK manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 733(e)(1)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.[<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy </T3>(52FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient [<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR12552, April 15, 1988).] Since RHP and SKF sell in the United States throughrelated companies, and their rates are sufficiently high, we find thatthe requirements of section 733(e)(1)(A) are met for these companies withrespect to two classes or kinds of merchandise. Therefore, the followingchart sets forth our company-specific preliminary determinations with respectto the existence of critical circumstances for each company and each classor kind of merchandise from the UK.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s36,r10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Critical circumstances</H1>Ball bearings:<ITAG tagnum="3">SHP</ITAG><D>No.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">SKF</ITAG><D>No.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">All others</ITAG><D>No.</D>Spherical roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="3">SKF</ITAG><D>Yes.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">All others</ITAG><D>Yes.</D>Cylindrical roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="3">RHP</ITAG><D>Yes.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">All others</ITAG><D>Yes.</D>Needle roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="3">INA</ITAG><D>No.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">All others</ITAG><D>No.</D>Plain bearings:<ITAG tagnum="3">Rose</ITAG><D>No.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">All others</ITAG><D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>We will verify the information used in making our final determinationsin accordance with section 776(b) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandisefrom the UK, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of thisnotice, with the exception of Rose and all other producers of plain bearings,that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or afterthe date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of theAct.
