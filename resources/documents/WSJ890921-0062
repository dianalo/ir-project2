A decision is still pending on which subsidiary.    NEC also hasn't decided when to launch its U.S.-based production. A spokesman said a decision on the starting date will be made within a year.    The new computer, called the &quot;PC9801LX5C,&quot; was introduced inside Japan in late August and is characterized as the first personal computer with a color liquid crystal display to be commercialized in the world.    The product is designed for lap-top use and displays information in eight colors.    Production is expected to help expand the company's business in the U.S. where its share in the personal computer market is about 5%, compared with its more than 50% share of the Japanese personal computer market. </TEXT></DOC>
