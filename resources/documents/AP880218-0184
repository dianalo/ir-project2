The offer represented the first significant union victory inBritain in seven years. Ford made several concessions to end thestrike, which began Feb. 8.   Voter returns Thursday night showed 70 percent of the workers atthe 22 British plants favored the offer, Ford said. The companysaid it expected workers to be back on the job Monday.   The Transport and General Workers Union, which representstwo-thirds of the workers, confirmed that about 70 percent of itsmembers supported the proposal.   A final vote count was expected to be released Friday.   The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday betweencompany and union officials.   The company backed down on its demand for a three-year contract,offering the two-year pact instead, and agreed to a wage increaseof at least 14 percent over the term of the contract.   Previously, it offered an increase of 7 percent in the firstyear and 2.5 percent above the rate of inflation _ which iscurrently 3.3 percent _ over the next two years.   A middle-range worker earned $327 a week under the old contract.   Ford won some changes in work practices to boost productivity,but they must be agreed to on the plant level rather than imposedby management.   The last major British union victory occurred in February 1981,when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher backed off plans to closecoal pits after miners threatened a nationwide strike.   The Ford strike has prompted layoffs of more than 9,700 Fordworkers in Genk, Belgium. It also threatened production at Fordplants in Spain and West Germany, which rely on parts made at theBritish plants.   The car company said it didn't know when production at the Genkplant would return to normal.   Ford said the strike, the to hit the automaker in Britain innearly a decade, was costing the company $350 million in lostproduction. Ford's British workers last struck in 1978, when theywalked out for nine weeks.   The strike, combined with a recent walkout by ferry workers andlabor unrest in the state-run National Health Service and coalmines, prompted concern that there might be a new wave ofindustrial strikes and an increase in pay demands in Britain.   Britain has been relatively free of labor strife since Mrs.Thatcher's Conservative government came to power and curbed theinfluence of Britain's once-powerful unions.   The last major industrial strike in Britain was a yearlongwalkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-85. It ended indefeat for their union.</TEXT></DOC>
