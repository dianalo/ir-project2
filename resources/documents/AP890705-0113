Weather permitting, in separate firings at the Longhorn ArmyAmmunition Plant, two missile sections strapped horizontally onreinforced stands will consume their solid fuel propellant. Afterthe firing renders the missile useless, the sections are to becrushed.   The operation comes under provisions of the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty between the United States and the SovietUnion, signed in December 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev.   A 10-member Soviet inspection team was scheduled to monitorThursday's event, which marks the destruction of the 169th and lastPershing 1A, plant spokeswoman Dorothy Grant said.   The INF treaty, which took effect June 1, 1988, requireselimination of 859 American intermediate-range and shorter rangemissiles and 1,752 similar Soviet missiles within three years.   The missiles marked for destruction, which have a range of 300 to3,400 miles, are unarmed. Nuclear warheads and electronic guidancesystems were removed, with the warheads being stored by theDepartment of Energy.   The destruction of the 5,500-pound Pershing 1A is being handledby Utah-based Morton Thiokol Inc., which built many of the Pershingmotors at Longhorn.   Larger Pershing 2 missiles will continue to be destroyed underterms of the treaty. At Longhorn, Ms. Grant said nine Pershing 2missiles have been eliminated, with 234 more headed for the junkheap worldwide. In addition, hundreds of ground-launched cruisemissiles will be destroyed by the Air Force, she said.   Besides Longhorn, Pershing 2 missiles also are being eliminatedfrom an Army depot near Pueblo, Colo. Other missiles are being takenout of service at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., and nearFrankfurt, West Germany.   The Soviets began destruction of several classes of similarmissiles a year ago.   The treaty allows the missiles to be burned in place and thencrushed, to be destroyed with explosives or to be launched withoutwarheads. American officials have said they chose burning in placebecause it is the cheapest and cleanest method.   Thursday's affair was expected to be a much lower-key event thanthe first destruction at Longhorn Sept. 8, 1988.   Then-Vice President Bush made the first missile's demise a stopon a campaign swing through Texas. Trailing him were about 300reporters and photographers. Bush hailed the event as ``the day webegan to reverse the arms race ... the day we began destroying theweapons of destruction.''</TEXT></DOC>
