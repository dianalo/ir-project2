For checking the accuracy of the method,acurately weighed amount of Hg is added to the cell and the amount isredetermined. It is found that the error is within +- 0.3%. This methodis not only more convenient for use, but is also much more accurate thanthe old method of weighing the Hg that has to be emptied from the cell.</TEXT></DOC>
