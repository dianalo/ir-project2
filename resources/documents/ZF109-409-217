 Samples are first ionized, and then the charged fragments are separatedand analyzed according to their mass-to-charge ratios.andP;  Hp makes quadrupolemass spectrometers, which accomplish this separation using a quadrupolarelectrostatic field.andM;The ionization method determines the nature of the fragmentation of themolecules.andP;  So-called soft ionization causes less fragmentation and hardionization causes more.andP;  Electron impact (EI) ionization, a hard ionizationtechnique, has evolved as the most useful technique, especially for gettinginformation on the structure of the molecule.andP;  When the electron energy iscontrolled, the resultant fragmentation is extensive, thus elucidating thestructure of the molecule.andP;  The process is also quite reproducible.andP;  The massspectra that result can be compared to spectra stored in a library and thusused to identify the compound being analyzed.andM;Chemical ionization (CI) is a softer ionization technique than EI.andP;  It isoften used when EI fragments the molecule to the point where little or nounfragmented molecules are left and thus the analysis will not yield themolecular weight of the compound.andP;  CI spectra do not contain sufficientfragmentation information to be library-searchable.andM;In addition to identification, mass spectrometers are also used forquantitation down to very small concentrations parts per million andsometimes parts per billion.andM;Many samples of interest are not single compounds but are mixtures ofcompounds.andP;  Examples are metabolytes in a biological sample or the seepagefrom a toxic waste dump.andP;  Before the mass spectrometer can do its job, thesample must be separated into individual compounds.andP;  This separation isaccomplished using a gas chromatograph (GC) or a liquid chromatograph (LC).andO;Both types of instruments are produced by HP.andP;  In a gas chromatograph thesample is first vaporized and then separated into its components as they arecarried by a gas stream.andP;  This gas stream can then be introduced directlyinto the mass spectrometer and each compound in the mixture analyzed as itenters.andP;  This combined technique is known as GC/N4S.andM;Many compounds are not volatile enough to be readily changed into the gaseousstate without decomposing.andP;  With mixtures containing these relativelyinvolatile and thermally labile compounds an LC is usually the separationinstrument.andP;  In an LC the compound mixture is dissolved in a suitable solventsuch as water or methanol and then separated into the individual compounds.andM;A problem is that this liquid stream cannot be introduced at normal LC flowrates directly into the mass spectrometer without overloading the vacuumsystem.andP;  Even if this were not a problem, the liquid would have to beevaporated and the solvent pumped away before the ionization would bepossible.andP;  Various techniques have been tried over the years to solve thisdilemma.andP;  With the moving belt interface,' the liquid is deposited on amoving belt, which carries it through a desolvation stage and finally intothe mass spectrometer.andP;  With the direct liquid introduction interface,&quot; aportion of the LC flow is nebulized directly into the mass spectrometer.andO;While the moving belt interface can be used in a variety of ionization modeswhich generate a range of analytical information, mechanical and thermallimitations make operation difficult and problematic for compounds of limitedvolatility or stability.andP;  Although direct liquid introduction shows improvedcapability with respect to thermally labile compounds, the techniquegenerates only chemical ionization spectra with the reagent gas limited toHPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) mobile phase components.andP;  HPhas made a direct liquid introduction product in the past.andM;None of these earlier techniques has earned liquid chroum separator in whichthe relatively low-momentum vapor molecules are pumped away while thehigher-momentum particles continue into the source of the mass spectrometer,where they are vaporized, ionized, and finally mass analyzed.andM;The nebulizer, which is pictured in Fig.andP;  3, consists of a simple coaxialpneumatic nebulizer.andP;  The HPLC effluent passes through the fused silicacapillary running down the center of the nebulizer while the heliumnebulization gas flows around the capillary and forms the aerosol at theexit.andP;  The HPLC effluent can be any commonly used HPLC mobile phase, such aswater, methanol, acetonitrile, hexane, or chloroform.andP;  The single restrictionon the mobile phase is that if a mobile phase buffer is necessary, the buffermust be volatile.andP;  HPLC flow rates between 0.1 and 1.0 ml/min are acceptable.andO;Typical helium flows are between 1 and 2 l/min.andP;  The nebulizer has areplaceable 2-/Lm filter to prevent clogging of the fused silica capillary.andO;However, since the capillary internal diameter is 100  Am, the in-line filteris merely a precaution.andM;The desolvation chamber is a hollow cylindrical section between the nebulizerand the momentum separator.andP;  The purpose of the desolvation chamber is toallow sufficient time and travel space for effective thermal transfer-via thecarrier gas-from the desolvation chamber walls to the aerosol droplets toevaporate the solvent.andP;  The desolvation chamber is maintained atapproximately 200 toff and 45'C.andP;  Although earlier attempts in similarinterfaces used lower pressures at this stage, the relatively high pressureis necessary for the helium gas to maintain thermal transfer between thedesolvation chamber wall and the solvent droplets.andP;  The desolvation chamberis thermostatically controlled to replace the heat that is absorbed as thesolvent droplets evaporate.andM;The momentum separator consists of three main parts: a nozzle and twoskimmers.andP;  The nozzle funnels the flow of the vapor particle mixture,creating a supersonic jet expansion (and consequently the particle beam).andP;  Ina supersonic jet expansion, the fluid flow exits from the nozzle atsupersonic velocity.andP;  At a specific distance from the nozzle orifice, aregion known as the mach disk exists, where the flow makes a transition fromsupersonic to subsonic velocity.andP;  The first skimmer orifice is placed justinside the mach disk so that the central particle beam is efficientlytransmitted while allowing the vapor molecules to be pumped away.andP;  Similarly,the second skimmer removes more of the vapor while transferring a highproportion of the analyte particles.andP;  The ultimate result of this two-stageprocess is a pressure reduction from 200 torr in the desolvation chamber toapproximately 5 toff in the space between the nozzle and the first skimmer,then to 0.2 torr in the space between the two skimmers, and finally to 2  X10-5  torr in the mass spectrometer source manifold.andM;After exiting the momentum separator, the particle beam passes through atransfer tube into the mass spectrometer ion source.andP;  The particles strikethe inner walls of the source body (which are held at approximately 250'C)and are vaporized.andP;  The vapor phase molecules thus generated can be ionizedby either electron impact or chemical ionization.andM;Performance OptimizationandM;One of the most important features of the particle beam LCIMS system is itsease of use.andP;  In most cases, optimization of performance can be accomplishedby a single adjustment, the nebulizer.andP;  It is also possible to adjust severalother operating parameters, such as desolvation chamber temperature, heliumflow rate, and source temperature, but default values for these parametersusually work well.andP;  All of these parameters are mobile phase dependent exceptfor the MS source temperature, which is compound dependent.andM;A knob on the back of the nebulizer can be turned to adjust the axialposition of the fused silica capillary in the nebulizer body.andP;  Since theoptimal position is mobile phase dependent, the position must be adjustedwhen running different mobile phases.andP;  For gradient elution, a compromiseposition is chosen.andM;Fig.andP;  4 shows the signal intensity for long injections of caffeine as afunction of nebulizer position and mobile phase.andP;  Although the exact shape ofthis surface will change for different fused silica capillary tips, thetwo-maxima shape is typical, the minimum being at a point where the fusedsilica capillary tip is almost flush with the nebulizer orifice.andP;  Note thatwhen higher proportions of water are used in the mobile phase, there is aloss of signal.andP;  This trend is seen with other reversed-phase solvents aswell, such as water/acetonitrile and water/THF mixtures.andP;  If the nebulizer isadjusted properly, the loss of signal is approximately 50%.andP;  In the case ofnormal-phase solvents, such as hexane and chloroform, this signal loss is notseen.andM;Although the desolvation chamber temperature can have a significant effect onsensitivity, it is generally unnecessary to adjust it, since a temperature of45C is near optimal for most mobile phases.andP;  The effects on sensitivity ofdesolvation chamber temperature and mobile phase composition are shown inFig.andP;  5.andP;  Again, higher proportions of water show poorer sensitivity thanpure organic solvents.andP;  In cases where high proportions of water are usedexclusively (isocratic), it is sometimes advantageous to raise thedesolvation chamber to 50 degrees C.andM;The helium nebulization gas flow rate also has an effect on sensitivity forhigh aqueous mobile phases.andP;  In most cases, a flow of 2 l/min (approximately40 psi inlet pressure) is optimal, but when using high organic mobile phases,it is possible to reduce the flow to 1.5 l/min.andP;  The effects on sensitivityof mobile phase characteristics and helium flow rate are shown in Fig.andP;  6.andM;Operation of the particle beam LC/MS system has been optimized for liquidinlet flows of 0.5 ml/min or less.andP;  Although flows as high as 1 ml/min can beused, there is a loss of sensitivity at higher flows as illustrated in Fig.andO;7.andP;  Below approximately 0.5 ml/min, the response plateaus at a maximum level.andO;This trend is true for both high aqueous and high organic solvents.andP;  Inpractice, the need to use a flow rate of approximately 0.5 ml/min or less formaximum performance is not a limitation since this is the ideal flow rangefor 2-mm i.d.andP;  columns.andP;  These columns can be used with conventional HPLCequipment as a simple alternative to more conventional 4.6-mm i.d.andP;  columnswhile offering the additional advantages of reduced solvent consumption(approximately fivefold), reduced packing consumption for exotic stationaryphases, and increased mass sensitivity when used with concentration dependentdetectors such as UV.andP;  Columns are commercially available with a wide rangeof selectivities and efficiencies comparable to 4.6-mm i.d.andP;  colunms.andM;Finally, the mass spectrometer source temperature plays an important role inparticle beam LC/MS spectral quality.andP;  If the source temperature is too high,significant thermal degradation may occur.andP;  Actually, this effect is similarto that seen for all MS operation modes.andP;  The effect of temperature dependsupon the thermal stability of the analyte.andP;  Caffeine, for example, shows verylittle change in either signal intensity or spectral characteristics over awide temperature range (150 to 350 degrees C), while some corticosteroidsshow a very strong effect.andP;  Typically, signal intensity and thermaldegradation increase with increasing source temperature.andP;  Thermal degradationis evidenced by a decrease in the ratio of higher-mass ions to lower-massions.andM;Quantitative PerformanceandM;Because of its relatively recent introduction, particle beam LCIMS has notbeen fully characterized.andP;  In particular, the quantitative performance hasbeen evaluated in depth for only a small number of compounds.andP;  In addition tostudies already under way, however, user-generated results will quickly helpto clarify this area in the near future.andP;  This section summarizes theperformance to date.andM;Response factors for particle beam LC/MS are not totally uniform.andP;  As aresult, different compounds exhibit a range, of detection limits.andP;  This isillustrated by the histogram shown in Fig.andP;  8.andP;  The data in this plot showsthe minimum detectable quantities (MDQS) for 92 pesticides in nanograms.andP;  Thetests were run on an HP 5988A mass spectrometer in flow injection analysis(plug injections) and calculated as the amount required to generate a signalto peak-to-peak noise ratio (S/N) of 2 using total ion current (TIC) infull-scan (scan width of 50 amu to the molecular weight + 50 amu) dataacquisition.andP;  It can be seen from this data that 50% of the compounds testedshow detection limits below 25 ng.andP;  As a rule of thumb, 100 ng of mostcompounds will generate useful mass spectra.andP;  There are compounds thatperform especially poorly in EI, such as glyphosine (MDQ = 635 ng) andcompounds that perform especially well, such as diuron  (MMQ = 2 ng).andO;Although tests for the NMQs of these pesticides had not been run on the newerHP 5989A mass spectrometer at the time this paper was written, the resultsare expected to improve by about a factor of five when using the newerinstrument.andP;  It should be noted that while the response factors do show somevariation, the range is less than that seen for thermospray on similarcompounds.andM;The linearity of particle beam LCIMS is relatively independent of samplecharacteristics.andP;  Although the calibration curve is fit well with a standardlinear function ([r.sup.2] = 0.9995), there appears to be a reproducibledeviation from linearity at lower levels.andP;  This can be seen in Fig.andP;  9, whichis a calibration curve for caffeine.andP;  The data shown is from selected ionmonitoring for a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 194.andP;  (The molecular weight ofcaffeine is 194.)andM;The reproducibility of particle beam LC/MS is excellent.andP;  Typically,full-scan EI TIC data shows relative standard deviations (RSD) of 10% orless, while extracted ion currents or selected ion monitoring data shows RSDsof 5% to 7%, depending on the concentration level.andP;  This reproducibility ispartially the result of noise characteristics that are relatively independentof HPLC flow pulsations, yielding smooth spike-free chromatograms.andM;ApplicationsandM;Particle beam LC/N4S has potential utility in solving varied analyticalproblems.andP;  From the confirmation of identity and quantitative analysis ofenvironmental contaminants to structure elucidation of pharmaceutical andbioscience related samples, the capability of generating EI or CI spectrafrom previously unapproachable compounds opens a number of excitingpossibilities.andM;One of the application areas of greatest potential for particle beam LC/MS isthe analysis of samples of environmental interest.andP;  Particle beam LC/MSsolves two critical problems in this area.andP;  First, it allows samples to beanalyzed that cannot be analyzed by GC/N4S.andP;  In a recent study of aCalifornia site,5 it was determined that only 10% of the total organichalogen (TOX) could be accounted for using conventional analytical methods.andO;This brings up the frightening question, &quot;What potential health hazards arewe exposed to but unable to monitor because of analytical limitations?&quot;andO;Particle beam LC/N4S may allow us to expand the range of compounds that weare able to examine.andP;  Second, because of the legal and economic ramificationsof environmental monitoring, it is critical that the identification ofenvironmental contaminants be unequivocal.andP;  In many cases, the CI spectraprovided by thermospray or other LCIMS techniques simply lack sufficientinformation content to make these identifications.andP;  The EI spectra providedby particle beam LC/MS, on the other hand, are generally specific enough tobe a source of positive identification.andM;In 1987, approximately 150 compounds were removed from the U.S.A.andO;Environmental Protection agency's Appendix VIII to form Appendix IX, for themost part because of insufficient analytical methodology.andP;  Fig.andP;  10 shows theseparation of some of those compounds.andP;  Note the excellent chromatographicresolution and fidelity.andP;  Of the compounds shown, the spectra of all but one(amitrole) were found in the Wiley/NBS spectral library and were, in fact,the first choice identified by probability-based matching (PBM) using acomputer-based library search in spite of the fact that none of them isamenable to GC/MS separation.andP;  Many of the spectra found in the Wiley/NBSspectral library were generated by direct insertion probe  (DEP).andM;A similar environmental application, the analysis of triazine pesticides, isshown in Fig.andP;  11.andP;  Although some of the triazine pesticides can be separatedusing GC, RPLC is the separation method of choice because of its simplicityand the on-line sample handling characteristics of automated HPLC.andP;  Using avery simple valving configuration, it is possible to preconcentraterelatively large volumes of environmental samples automatically.andP;  The spectrashown on the left in Fig.andP;  11 are extracted from a peak in the total ionchromatogram that appears to be a single homogeneous peak but is, in fact,two nearly coeluting components.andP;  Through selected ion profiles, it ispossible to separate and quantify these two compounds.andM;Fig.andP;  12 shows an example of a sample of pharmaceutical interest, theseparation of corticosteroids.andP;  As mentioned above, corticosteroids show astrong temperature dependence.andP;  Although signal intensity can be enhanced byusing a higher source temperature, this results in increased thermaldegradation.andP;  The chromatogram shown represents 100 ng per component at 250degrees C.andM;Another example of a life-science application is the separation of aflatoxinsB1, B2, G1, and G2, as shown in Fig.andP;  13.andP;  Through the use of selected ionmonitoring, it is possible to detect and confirm the presence of thesecompounds at relatively low levels.andM;Finally, the analysis of monosaccharides and disaccharides using ammoniachemical ionization particle beam LC/MS is shown in Fig.andP;  14.andP;  Thisapplication provides a means of performing group-type separations since allpentose monosaccharides, hexose monosaccharides, and homogeneous and mixeddisaccharides yield group-specific spectra.andP;  Note that the detection limitsare well below those obtainable with conventional HPLC and refractive indexdetection.andM;ConclusionandM;Particle beam LC/MS offers an exciting new approach to interfacing LC and MS.andO;Its El capability, excellent quantitative performance, and ease of usepromise to make it the new standard for routine LC/N4S operation.andP;  It shouldbe noted that, like any technique, particle beam LC/N4S does have itslimitations, and there are samples that will be better approached using othertechniques such as thermospray LC/MS.andP;  Furthermore, particle beam LC/MS is arelatively new technique and is not totally mature.andP;  There are a number ofareas that remain to be understood and characterized.andP;  Hewlett-Packard's goalin implementing particle beam LC/N4S is to provide a tool for solvinganalytical problems.andP;  As experience accumulates, strengths and limitations ofthe technique will become more clearly defined.andM;AfterwordandM;As this article was going to press, the HP 5989A mass spectrometer wasintroduced, along with a new particle beam interface.andP;  The data in thisarticle was acquired using the older HP 5988A system.andP;  Data taken to date onthe newer HP 5989A system indicates an improvement in sensitivity on theorder of five to one over the HP 5988A.andP;  This improvement is compounddependent.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;The authors wish to thank Rune Brandt and Mirko Martich for their outstandingcontributions to the design of the instrument, Laura Cerruti for her diligentrunning of test samples, Jean-Luc Truche for his gentle and knowledgeableleadership, John Michnowicz who recognized from the start the power of thetechnique, Dave Gunn and Ernie Strehlow for modelmaking bordering on magic,and all the people at the HP Scientific Instruments Division who worked sohard to make this product a success.andM;ReferencesandM;1.andP;
