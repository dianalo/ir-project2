ADDS byline.^By DENNIS REDMONT</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul began a tour of one ofAfrica's most prosperous and democratic countries today as theVatican announced a fifth papal visit to the continent next year.South Africa was not included.   ``Botswana is an island of peace with itself and itsneighbors,'' the pope told an airport crowd of several thousand,among them a choir of barebreasted schoolgirls. ``In fact, it canbe rightly called an island of peace in a troubled sea.'   The diamond-rich nation maintains a Western-style, multipartydemocracy in a region of one-party black-ruled states. Besidesconflict over racial segregation in South Africa, southern Africais torn by guerrilla warfare and civil strife.   Botswana has largely avoided involvement in these conflicts butSouth Africa has made several raids against what it claims areguerrilla centers of the African National Congress, which isfighting to overthrow South Africa's government. Botswana hasdenied that it harbors guerrillas.   Before the pope flew from Zimbabwe for the second stop on hisfive-nation African tour, Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro saidJohn Paul had accepted invitations to visit Madagascar and Tanzania.   There has been speculation that John Paul also would visitAngola and possibly South Africa on that trip, expected next May.Navarro said neither country was ``on the program,'' although heconfirmed that Angolan bishops had recently addressed an invitationto the pope.   On his current visit, the pope has coupled condemnation of SouthAfrica's apartheid policies with pleas for dialogue with SouthAfrica to solve regional problems.   According to Navarro, the Vatican plays an active role inregional peacemaking efforts, and sent French Cardinal RogerEtchegarray, a top aide, to the region three times in the pastyear. Etchegarray met with officials of South Africa, Angola andMozambique in May and presented them with a letter from John Paul.   The pope concludes his tour with a visit to Mozambique onSaturday. Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas, in a statementissued in Lisbon, Portugal, said they would declare a unilateralcease-fire around the Mozambican cities the pope will visit _Maputo, Beira and Nampula.   But Navarro stopped short of claiming a mediation role for theVatican.   ``The role of the Holy See in affairs of the region is not anddoesn't want to be a mediation role in the diplomatic sense of theword,'' Navarro told reporters. ``It wants to create a climate inwhich dialogue can be possible.''   John Paul was scheduled to meet Botswana President Quett Masireand give a Mass at the national stadium in Gaborone during a visitof less than 24 hours. The expected crowd of 50,000 at the stadiumwould be larger than the number of Roman Catholic church members inthe country, about 45,000.   The pontiff was scheduled to leave Wednesday morning for themountain kingdom of Lesotho, where thousands of pilgrims from SouthAfrica were expected to attend ceremonies.   During a three-day visit to Zimbabwe, the pope appealed forreconciliation and human rights, and for an end to racial andtribal discrimination. He celebrated two masses, held a rally ofmore than 30,000 young people, talked with diplomats and metCatholic bishops and other Christian leaders from the region.</TEXT></DOC>
