An FDIC researcher has been analyzing the thrift industry's problems because a merger of the FDIC and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has been proposed as one alternative to recapitalizing the insolvent Sandamp;L deposit insurance fund.    Congress is considering a plan that would raise $8.5 billion for the FSLIC by selling long-term bonds financed by the nation's 3,200 insured thrifts.    The General Accounting Office, citing FSLIC data, has put the tab for closing the most troubled thrifts at $25 billion. But the FDIC study, prepared in the spring, concludes that that figure was too low, the spokesman said.    The document and its findings were first reported in American Banker, a trade publication. </TEXT></DOC>
