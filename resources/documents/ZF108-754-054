 But it was only the beginning.andM;The business recovery planning team taht championed the backup data centreand recovery plan was immediately rewarded with a new project -- createbusiness resumption plans for every critical department in the bank, upwardsof 90 separate plans.andM;To date, our four-member recovery planning group has completed 13 plans ineight bank divisions -- about one a month.andP;  This rate of plan implementationwould not be possible without the continued support of TD Bank's topmanagement and the productivity enhancement provided by the PC-based Rexsysbusiness recovery planning system from Recovery Managemetn Inc. of Littleton,Mass.andM;While TD Bank's backup site was under construction, a contingency plan fordata processing was created using a commercial planning package and a numberof home-grown procedures.andP;  However, our planning group concluded that this adhoc method of contingency plan development would never work forthe bank'snumerous and diverse business units.andM;A faster, more powerful planning system was needed that could provide astandardized means of evaluating departmental criticality, provide audittrails and be easy enough for departments to use if need be.andM;In addition, the new planning tool had to be flexible enough to adapt to themany different business operations the group would encounter.andP;  Each of the 80to 90 plans that TD Bank needed to develop would be unique to some extent, soa system with sets of rigid pre-written procedures was unacceptable.andM;After evaluating several contingency planning systems, we selected Rexsys.andO;Rexsys is an expert system that offered us the tools we needed to tackle themulti-faceted planning task that lay ahead.andM;Rexsys offers a natural language interface that puts our departmental clientsat ease.andP;  We often let department representatives use the system for planmaintenance.andP;  Just as important to us as the natural language interface wasthe system's inference engine, which not only helps us determine whichdepartments are critical to our business, but what functions in thosedepartments are either critical, necessary or optional.andM;The system is built around a relational database which provides a singlepoint of data entry and single point for updating.andP;  The relational databasedesign lets us enter information once and use it in a number of differentways.andM;The system's report generation feaures make it easy to print and distributemacro prototype and final plans to departments.andP;  The system's audit utilityautomatically tracks our use of the system, which helps our internal auditinggroup in their annual audits.andM;In 1988, a single copy of Rexsys was purchased in order to demonstrate thesytem for others in the bank.andP;  After a successful trial, a corporate licencewas purchased and the bank began to develop business recovery plans for ourcritical departments.andM;There are 11 corporate divisions within TD Bank.andP;  Recovery planning effortshave focused first on the domestic money making divisions, such as Corporateand Investment Banking and Investor and Payroll Services.andP;  This was an easydecision for a number of reasons.andM;First and foremost, we're in business to make money and providemoney-handling services.andP;  The need to protect these fundamental elements ofour business was a prime concern.andM;Second, the business recovery planning project needed early and visiblesuccess in order to bolster credibility.andP;  By gaining the support of and byimplementing recovery plans for TD Bank's key money-making divisions we havesmoothed our path into other areas of the bank.andP;  We can point to the earlyplans and use them as leverage in dealing with other divisions.andM;The first department we tackled was our Treasury operation, which includesour traders and a very large international network.andP;  We have trading desks inLondon, Tokyo and New York.andP;  Everything comes through Toronto.andP;  We used thedevelopment of the Treasury recovery planning approach as a template forother areas of the bank.andM;The Securities division was an area that required special attention becauseit is an inherently manual and paper-based operation.andP;  Physical securitiesare an essential part of the business -- they're negotiable.andP;  As part of ourrecovery planning analysis, we recommended that they use a PC-based system totrack the group's holdings.andP;  At least, in the event of a disaster, we'll knowwhat we're liable for.andM;Another critical area addressed early in recovery planning was HumanResources.andP;  The Rexsys system's inference engine helped us rate each of the25 departments within HR as either critical (must be covered by a plan),necessary or optional.andM;Each department manager completes a Rexsys questionaire, which asks them torate different departmental functions.andP;  The manager is asked to imagine whatwould happen if a particular function was not performed for a day, a week ora month.andP;  What would be the impact?andM;Managers typically come up with about 10 to 20 per cent of their businessunits that are absolutely critical to provide service.andP;  In this way, wedetermined that three departments within the HR division -- Employee Payroll,Pension and Employee Communications -- would be critical to recover followinga disaster.andM;Employee payroll was an obvious must -- if you don't pay employees, theywon't work.andP;  the Pension area is a highly sensitive area.andP;  Most pensionersare highly dependent on their pension disbursement, so that area was deemedcritical.andP;  Employee communications is an area that we felt was criticalbecause it is our lifeline, our link to employees following a disaster.andM;Once we determine which departments are critical, as well as what functionswithin those departments are critical, we use Rexsys to build a plan.andP;  Wework with the manager to develop procedures and systems, using only a subsetof the normal environment, that will allow them to restore critical servicefollowing a disaster.andM;We assume that anything that is connected to either the central computingfacility or a regional centre, is automatically protected in terms of data,applications and hardware backup.andP;  When we come across an area that is solelypaper-based, we recommend ways that applications could be written toeliminate the paper database.andM;Rexsys structures and accelerates the planning process so that we cangenerate macro-level plans in a matter of weeks and use them as a discussiontool.andP;  The analysis aspect of the system helps us keep an objective view ofdepartmental functions.andP;  The inference engine provides the rationale, in manycases, for leaving a departmental function unprotected in a disaster.andM;From start to finish, working part time, we spend about five to six monthswith each division.andP;  Each business recovery analyst works on two to threedepartments simultaneously.andP;  Often, information is required that takes adepartment manager two to three weeks to gather.andP;  We'll work with anotherdepartment while waiting for a response.andM;We've completed 13 departmental plans to date, and hope to increase the paceas we move on to increasingly less critical and less complex departments.andP;  By1992, we hope to complete recovery planning for each of the 80 to 90 targetdepartments, branch offices and subsidiaries.andP;  With continued managementsupport and through the use of expert system tools, we believe this is anattainable goal.andM;Des O'Callaghan joined Toronto Dominion Bank in 1973 and is now manager ofbusiness recovery planning based in Toronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
