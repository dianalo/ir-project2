Still, Airspace Branch(ATO-240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air TrafficOperations Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue,SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267-9250.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">History</ITAG>On July 15, 1987, the FAA proposed to amend Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) to alter the descriptions of several airwayslocated in the vicinity of New York (52 FR 26494). Interested parties wereinvited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting writtencomments on the proposal to the FAA. Congressman Dean A. Gallo requestedthat implementation of Phase II of the EECP be suspended pending a fulland complete study of the noise impact over the State of New Jersey.The State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection commentswere mostly directed at the jet route changes, but were additionally concernedwith what impact these jet route changes would have on the flight pathsin the lower altitudes. They state that ``consideration of the direct andindirect aircraft noise impacts on residential communities should havebeen factored into the EECP planning process.'' People Against Newark Noisecommented that certain residents of New Jersey object to changes in airroutes which will bring jet noise upon previously peaceful communities.Environmental assessment of airspace actions by the FAA is conducted inaccordance with FAA Order 1050.1D, Policies and Procedures for HandlingEnvironmental Impacts. Appendix 3 of the order requires environmental assessmentof a Part 71 airspace action only when it would result in rerouting trafficover a noise-sensitive area at altitudes less than 3,000 feet above thesurface. No such low-altitude routings where involved in the airway modificationadopted in this amendment, and we do not consider that an environmentalassessment is required under the National Environmental Policy Act or theAgency's Environmental Guidelines. In view of the comments of the New Jerseyparties, however, the FAA is in the process of conducting a review of theenvironmental implications of the overall impact of Phase II of the EECP.In consideration of the importance of the airway actions for the safe andefficient handling of air traffic on the east coast, and of the fact thatthe agency has complied with Federal environmental review requirements,the FAA does not believe that this action should be delayed pending theoutcome of the review. With respect to the studies being conducted by theGeneral Accounting Office and the New Jersey state government, the FAAwill fully consider the results of these studies when completed, but wedo not agree that important airway changes should be delayed pending theoutcome of those studies.People Against Newark Noise also questioned the basis for the FAA's determinationthat a regulatory evaluation is not required. The action does not meetthe threshold requirements for a major rule under Executive Order 12291,and for that reason, a regulatory impact analysis under that order is notrequired. Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11031) require an economic evaluation of agency rulemaking actionsexcept in emergencies or when the agency determines that the economic impactis so minimal that the action does not warrant a full evaluation. Sucha determination was made in this case, in consideration of the minimaleconomic impacts of the airway changes proposed. Similarly, a regulatoryflexibility analysis is not required since this action will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities underthe criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.AOPA objected that this proposal will impose complicated routings and/oradditional mileages. The FAA agrees there will be additional mileages oncertain airways due to the realignment of the standard instrument departuresand standard terminal arrival routes. Nevertheless, this change in trafficflow has resulted in more than a 40% reduction in departure/arrival delaysin the New York Metroplex area, thereby saving time and fuel. This actionshould more than offset the slight additional distance. The FAA does notconsider these actions to constitute a complication of routing. Shouldunforeseen problems arise as a result of this phase of the EECP, the FAAwould initiate appropriate remedial action as required.The Air Transport Association (ATA) endorsed the objective of the EECPto establish an improved air traffic system which reduces delays for aircraftdeparting and arriving terminals in the eastern United States. However,ATA requested an overview of the total plan. Also, ATA requested a longerresponse time to the NPRM's because of the large volume of very technicaland complicated material. FAA appreciates the comments and will carefullyreview and consider their suggestion. Section 71.123 of Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook 7400.6C datedJanuary 2, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters thedescriptions of VOR Federal Airways V-249, V-268 and V-270 located in thevicinity of New York. These airways are part of an overall plan designedto alleviate congestion and compression of traffic in the airspace boundedby Eastern, New England, Great Lakes and the Southern Regions. This amendmentis the final segment of Phase II of the EECP. Portions of Phase II wereimplemented on November 19, 1987, and January 14, 1988. Phase I was implementedFebruary 12, 1987. The EECP is designed to make optimum use of the airspacealong the east coast corridor. This action reduces en route and terminaldelays in the Boston, MA; New York, NY; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; and Atlanta,GA, areas, saves fuel and reduces controller workload. The EECP is beingimplemented in coordinated segments until completed.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, VOR Federal airways.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
