Sears said it has agreed in principle to sell the deposits of 22 of those branches, totaling $165 million, to California Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a unit of CalFed Inc. Terms weren't disclosed.    The Chicago retailer and financial services concern said the sale is part of its strategy to offer consumer financial services through nontraditional channels such as direct mail and Sears's Discover card. It said it will maintain its Glendale, Calif., headquarters office and continue to offer deposit products through that office.    Sears has been gradually disposing of its California savings and loan branches, which are owned by its Sears Savings Bank unit. In June 1986, Sears sold 16 of the branches to Financial Corp. of America, and in February, it sold another 50 branches to a unit of Citicorp. </TEXT></DOC>
