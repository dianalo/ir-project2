No pickup.</UNK><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two U.S. helicopters today rescued 32 people from aCypriot freighter battered by gale-force winds and heavy waves inthe Atlantic.   ``Everyone is off,'' a duty officer at the Coast Guard MaritimeRescue Center at Falmouth reported, about an hour and 15 minutesafter the two MH53-J helicopters had reached the 42,000-tonYarrowanga.   There was no report of any injuries to the crew members, who werelifted by winches into the helicopters, the officer said.   The listing ship, which was bound from Norway to the St. LawrenceSeaway in Canada to take on iron ore, suffered one large gash belowthe waterline on the right side of the hull and a larger hole higherup on the left side.   The ship's boiler had failed for a time on Friday, but it wasrestarted and the ship had been moving under its own power.   Fifteen people were taken aboard one helicopter and the other 17were on the second rescue craft, which were returning to ShannonInternational Airport in Ireland. Those aboard included the Germanmaster, his wife and 30 Filipino seamen. An earlier report said only31 people had been aboard.   The rescue, about 200 miles west of the Irish coast, wascompleted quickly despite winds in excess of 40 mph and 30-foot seas.   The helicopters, based at Woodridge-Bentwaters 70 miles east ofLondon, were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Herculestanker aircraft, which are specially designed for long-range rescuework.   A spokesman for Britain's Minister of Defense said the Royal AirForce had no helicopters capable of in-flight refueling.   The rescue center said a Dutch tug, the Typhoon, was expected toreach the Yarrowanga on Sunday and attempt to salvage it.   The Royal Air Force Rescue Center in Plymouth said the ship hadlost 120 square yards of plating below the waterline on the rightside and about 200 meters of plating above the water on the left.   Two British Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes from St.Mawgan in Cornwall, southwest England, reached the bulk carrierbefore dark on Friday and took pictures, showing a gaping hole inits left side and three hatches open.   Relays of Nimrods, designed for long searching at sea, circledthe ship overnight.</TEXT></DOC>
