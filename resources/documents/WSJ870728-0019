John McMahon, deputy CIA director under the late William Casey, is the most senior of the four. The others are Clair George, deputy director for operations; Duane Clarridge, the former chief of the European division; and Alan Fiers of the Central American Task Force. Mr. McMahon, who is retired from the agency, played a tangential role in the early stages of the Iran initiative, while the other three face questions regarding their contacts with former White House aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.    Messrs. George and Clarridge have been linked to a November 1985 shipment of U.S. arms sold through Israel to Tehran, and while protective of his friend, Col. North said Mr. Clarridge was instrumental in giving him operational advice.    Col. North implicated Mr. Fiers in knowing about the details of a covert airlift used to funnel arms to the Contras during the ban on U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan resistance.    According to investigative sources, the four men have previously been questioned by attorneys for the committees, but after Col. North's testimony, it was decided to call them back in a closed-door executive session. </TEXT></DOC>
