Following yesterday's strong close on the New York Mercantile Exchange, many analysts expect further gains in the days ahead.    U.S. oil prices should &quot;steadily, stair-step their way up to over $19&quot; a barrel, said Michael McDermott, vice president, institutional energy futures, at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York.    Crude oil contracts for March delivery on the Merc rose 32 cents to $18.58 a barrel. As has been the case in recent days, however, distillate prices led the market. March heating oil futures prices, for instance, soared 1.52 cents a gallon to 51.02 cents, and March unleaded gasoline contracts rose 1.11 cents to 51.96 cents a gallon.    Meanwhile, the spot, or noncontract, price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, surged 35 cents to $18.60 a barrel. The February spot price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European crude blend, rose 20 cents to $17.95 a barrel in late trading.    Much of the price movement was triggered by traders buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, brokers said. Chart-oriented technical buying accelerated the gains, traders said.    Strong demand by major oil companies in the U.S. Gulf Coast for fuel oil also triggered some early gains, traders said. &quot;Buyers who had been scaling back the past few days started picking up the pace of their bids,&quot; said Stephen Piasio, vice president, international energy department, at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York.    Moreover, estimates of continued low Saudi Arabian production led to some buying, said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago. Private oil industry analysts estimated that the Saudis produced an average of 3.5 million barrels a day for all of January, compared with its quota of 4.135 million barrels, Mr. Ritterbusch noted.    Some analysts also said unconfirmed reports that Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite was shot and critically wounded after he tried to escape his captors in Lebanon led to additional buying.    The reports &quot;didn't have an enormous effect,&quot; but led some nervous traders to cover their short, or selling, positions, said Edward Ryan, an oil broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York. Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York, added, &quot;Any political instability in the Middle East will eventually come to roost in the oil patch.&quot;    Whatever the motivation, however, &quot;the buyers have finally started to resurface,&quot; said Eric Bolling, oil broker in Boston for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    INTEREST RATES: Futures prices rose sharply on reports that Japanese investors bought about half of the $9.3 billion of 29 3/4-year Treasury bonds sold at auction yesterday. A stronger dollar also boosted bond futures, as the Treasury bond futures contract for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade closed up 1 1/16 at 100 5/8. &quot;The 30-year auction went really well, the market was up nearly all day,&quot; said Jon Pedersen, director of futures trading at Swink andamp; Co. in Little Rock, Ark. Speculation about an imminent Japanese discount rate cut or meeting of finance ministers from leading industrial countries also boosted demand for the auction, traders said. Mr. Pedersen said that futures traders were focusing on this morning's release of unemployment figures for January as the next gauge of the economy's health.    COTTON: Futures prices fell about one cent a pound in featureless trading. After the close, the Agriculture Department said export sales of cotton for the week ended Jan. 29 amounted to a net total of 37,600 bales. Gross sales were 68,300 bales, but contracts involving 30,700 bales were canceled. The relatively low net figure was similar to the number two weeks ago, when large cancellations created a net of 27,500 bales. Some analysts speculated that a tapering off is under way that could leave this season's exports short of the department's projection of 6.8 million bales. But Ernest Simon, who follows cotton for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he believes that total exports could exceed seven million bales because &quot;many of these contracts that have been canceled may have to be filled sooner or later. If they can't get the cotton one place, they'll get it in another,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
