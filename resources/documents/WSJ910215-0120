In closed-door meetings this month in Paris,representatives of the U.S. and 16 allies are writing newrules governing which computers, telephone exchanges andother high-technology products can be shipped eastward. Theresult, expected at the end of the month, &quot;will be a furtherliberalization, but nothing nearly as extensive&quot; as people inWestern industry had expected, says Eric Hirschhorn, anofficial of a high-tech industry lobbying group inWashington.</LP><TEXT>   A senior German government official in Bonn agrees: &quot;Wereally don't feel that we will succeed now in fulfilling thevery ambitious targets&quot; for trade liberalization that manyWestern governments had set for themselves last summer.   Several factors are behind the chill. One is the turmoilin the Soviet Union's Baltic republics that's giving greaterweight to U.S. conservatives' arguments that the Westshouldn't reward the Soviets with greater trade privilegesnow. Also, there's continuing concern, chiefly among U.S. andBritish electronic spy agencies, that the West may havealready moved too far toward authorizing some exports.   At a Paris meeting last June, the U.S. and its allies,flushed with euphoria from the Cold War's end, agreed onsweeping measures to liberalize exports in several categoriesof high-tech gear. Western businesses were allowed to exportto the East most personal computer models and many types ofmachine tools and telephone exchanges, includinghigh-performance, fiber-optic communications equipment.   But in Paris this month, European government and industryofficials say, the U.S., Britain, Australia and Canada haveteamed up to urge a freeze -- and on one product, a rollback-- in liberalization in communications. Arguing for greaterliberalization are Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Spainand the Netherlands.   For 42 years, the U.S. and its main allies have regulatedthe flow of technology to the East to protect Westernsecurity. Operating from Paris, the Coordinating Committeefor Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, sets guidelines.Each Cocom-member government then incorporates the guidelinesin its national export laws or regulations.   At this month's meeting in Paris, an added measure ofliberalization is expected to be authorized by Cocomofficials. Among other things, says one U.S. officialscheduled to attend the talks, export controls will likely beended for all PC models, including the most advancedgeneration using Intel Corp.'s i486 chips. Also, the groupwill likely pare down its detailed, 118-item list ofcontrolled goods to eight broad categories of embargoedproducts.   But what disappoints many Western exporters is what theyprobably won't get from the meeting, especially intelecommunications. Big-business groups in Germany, Britain,France, Japan, the U.S. and some other Cocom countries plansoon to issue a joint statement protesting what they see as aslowdown in liberalization.   U.S. officials acknowledge they are disputing with someallies how much further liberalization should go. Among themost controversial issues are specialized lasers used astransmitters in fiber-optic telecommunications cables. TheU.S., Britain, Canada and Australia want to roll back lastyear's agreement liberalizing exports of lasers that emitlight at wavelengths of as much as 1,370 nanometers.Communications lasers now being installed in the Westtypically operate at wavelengths of as much as 1,550nanometers, and consequently transmit far more telephonecalls and data over a single optical cable.   Although an arcane issue, it epitomizes this month's Cocomdebates in Paris. Arguing for liberalization, ChristopherPadilla, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.'sgovernment-affairs manager in Washington, says the disputedlasers &quot;aren't state-of-the-art and are used in basiccivilian communications&quot; in the West, posing little securityrisk if exported.   But U.S. and British officials, in particular, worry thatallowing the installation of such high-performancefiber-optic networks would make it harder for them toeavesdrop on Soviet communications.</TEXT></DOC>
