What makes awoman active?;   Holly Micelli, 22, of Cupertino, mountain bikes, skis, worksout at a health club and is a full-time student majoring in English. To her,&quot;An active woman doesn't let the circumstances of life change her goals. Sheis always willing to try something new, and she uses her mind and body to getin touch with nature.&quot;;   Micelli remembers hiking with her father and sisterswhen she was young. But being physically active and involved in the outdoorsdidn't really come until later.;   &quot;In high school none of my friends wereinto sports, just partying. I started working (at an outdoor equipmentretailer) when I was 16, and that's when I started doing the activities I donow. I had contact with other people that were into lots of different sports.There were always people to go mountain biking or skiing with.&quot;;   TriciaKeen, 39, of Mountain View, hikes, practices Tai Chi and Zen Buddhism, andworks in a literacy program. She thinks being an active woman &quot;is not justabout physical exercise, but exercising all parts. It's maintaining balance,challenging and growing in body, mind, and spirit. It looks different on eachwoman.;   &quot;It's an attitude.&quot;;   She says that &quot;I've been active all my life.I've always had so many interests. Sometimes it's hard to choose. Beingoutside has always been very important. I have very early memories ofpretending to be a cave woman sitting in the dirt in my back yard.&quot;;   Keenstarted a hiking program at the Cupertino Senior Center three years ago. &quot;It'sgreat having the seniors as models for getting older,&quot; Keen said. &quot;One of mybiggest challenges right now is just growing older. The kind of activities Ido has changed. The how and what has changed. Having been active all my life,it's harder to let go of a 'young' body. It looks different now.&quot;;   One ofthe women who hikes with Keen is Betty Dahlin, 62, who lives in Cupertino. Shealso walks every morning, plays bridge, bowls in a league, spends time withher grandchildren, and volunteers at the Senior Center. Dahlin considers anactive woman &quot;one that gets up and goes.&quot;;   Her husband of 38 years died sixyears ago. His death devastated her.;   &quot;My daughter found an ad for theMid-Peninsula Center for Widows and Widowers in the paper and put it on myrefrigerator,&quot; Dahlin said. &quot;She would call and ask, 'Have you gone yet?' Shekept on me so finally I went.;   &quot;At the meeting I saw a notice about a hikeso I decided to try it. It was the first thing I had done in six months. Wehiked at Wunderlich County park. I was in really bad shape. I wasn't eating orsleeping. I was weak and malnourished.&quot;;   She says that &quot;the hike was veryhard for me. I thought if this doesn't kill me, I'm going to be here for awhile.;   &quot;Now I just take one day at a time. I'm much better these days.&quot;;  Micelli, Keen and Dahlin have changed as a result of their active lives. Theyhave realized the benefits to the mind, the spirit and the body.;   LinaPelayo, 24, San Jose, who is active in theater arts, summed it up this way:&quot;An active woman doesn't have to do everything. It isn't necessarily beingbusy.&quot;;   Dr. Gabriel Barrio at Stanford's Children's Hospital believes thatan active lifestyle affects physical systems positively, that everyone canimprove the quality of their life though regular activity.;   &quot;The first thingthat leaps to mind when discussing women's health is the concern forosteoporosis,&quot; Barrio says. &quot;We know that bone density in women goes down withage. It peaks about mid-adolescence, then the bone deposition breaks down.This is especially true for women who don't exercise. We know that anythingthat gets you up and moving -- any repetitive movement like bicycling,walking, weight training -- will improve bone density and decreaseosteoporosis.&quot;;   He notes that &quot;almost every woman is concerned about herweight. In active women, hunger becomes more in tune to a need basis. Peoplein shape tend not to overeat.&quot;;   Barrios says that &quot;women who exerciseregularly have an enhanced sense of well being. This is true not just whenthey are exercising. They have an enhanced level of self-confidence. Exercisegives a feeling of accomplishment. People feel good about themselves.&quot;;  There are many ways to be an active woman. And many reasons why we choose it.Each of us manifests our activities differently.;   To be an active woman isnot always easy but it is simple. It requires desire, willingness, commitmentand time. Age is not a limitation, nor is fitness level or experience.;  Decide on an activity. Make a date to do it. Finding time can be the hardestpart, so schedule your choice or you may never do it. Then go.;   Be all thatyou can be. Be an active woman.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Stewart column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  900  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 28, 199100333005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
