Research efforts are intended: toevaluate the effectiveness of phenolase in metabolizing the most andleast toxic phenolic compounds studied; to determine the types and quantitiesof phenolic compounds produced by pine seedlings inoculated with {italPisolithus tinctorius} and receiving boron fertilization; to determinethe effects of hydroxylation of phenolic compounds on the growth of {italPisolithus tinctorius}, a known ectomycorrhizal fungus, grown in pureculture; and to determine the effect of phenolic glycosides on the growthof {ital Pisolithus tinctorius}, grown in pure culture.</TEXT></DOC>
