This instrument is basically comprisedof three high speed micro gas chromatographs that operate in parallelas a single unit. This instrument is designed specifically for determiningthe composition of natural gas from nitrogen to octane in less than twominutes. Using the gas composition, heating value and specific gravityof natural gas are calculated with an accuracy of less than 0.1% (1 BTU).The benefits of using this new analyzer technology are simple field installation,fast startup, easy operation, modular maintenance and extended analysisof gas through octane. 3 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
