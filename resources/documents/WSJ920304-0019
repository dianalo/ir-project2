The Sandamp;L regulators issued a subpoena to Ernst andamp; Youngeight months ago, seeking work documents for 23 Sandamp;Ls the firmadvised or audited. Those included Silverado Banking, Savingsandamp; Loan Association, Denver, and Vernon Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, Dallas. Their combined losses approach $2billion. The accounting firm has been fighting the subpoena,and the OTS went to court in January to enforce it.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The court sees no reason why OTS should not be able toinvestigate Ernst andamp; Young and enforce the subpoena in thiscase,&quot; federal Judge Royce Lamberth said in a 23-pageopinion.   He further noted that 690 failed financial institutionswere audited by Ernst andamp; Young or its predecessor firm.&quot;Accounting firms may have been responsible for many of theabuses which have led to this country's savings-and-loancrisis,&quot; the judge wrote, adding: &quot;. . . the court will notallow parties such as Ernst andamp; Young to avoid even beinginvestigated.&quot;   Judge Lamberth issued an order for the two sides to agreewithin 10 days on the scope of the document review, and howto provide the requested data. &quot;We will begin the process ofnegotiation while reviewing options for a stay and anappeal,&quot; an Ernst andamp; Young spokesman said.   The thrift office has pursued, in particular, law firmsand accountants to recover losses at Sandamp;Ls where theyperformed professional duties.</TEXT></DOC>
