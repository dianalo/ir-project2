Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX ECO MON </IN><G> FED </G><TEXT>   Picture this: Corporate profits explode; the Dow Jones Industrial Average soars past 3000, and the trade deficit approaches zero as U.S. companies batter their competitors around the globe.    That scenario may sound far-fetched, but it's a lot more pleasant to contemplate than the alternative: widespread unemployment as excessively leveraged companies and banks collapse and the economy plunges into a severe recession.    Suresh Bhirud is betting on the former scenario, simply because he thinks policy makers are terrified of the latter. Mr. Bhirud, a portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., has been arguing to clients for some time that the Federal Reserve, fully aware of the dangers of pushing a highly leveraged economy into a recession, will want to avoid recession at all costs. And that, he says, will give U.S. companies the leeway they need to exploit an unfamiliar role -- that of low-cost producer for the world.    &quot;I'm making an assumption that the Fed is comprised of normal people who will act rationally,&quot; he says. &quot;Since the late 1960s, the Fed has used recessions to fight inflation, and typically they've gotten carried away. But now that we've got all this debt, it may be the guarantee we need to avoid having the Fed put us into another recession.&quot;    Although Mr. Bhirud concedes that the U.S.'s debt load -- government, corporate and personal -- is staggering, he argues that the time is arriving for the big paybacks to begin. The dollar's devaluation, coupled with improved productivity in U.S. factories, has in many cases made U.S. manufacturers the low-cost producers among industrialized nations. That new competitiveness will reduce the U.S. trade deficit and boost corporate profits.    &quot;Corporations have done a wonderful job of controlling costs, and we're going to be amazed at their profits in 1989 and beyond,&quot; Mr. Bhirud says.    Further, full employment -- the result of running factories at high operating rates to meet world demand -- will not only reduce federal payments for unemployment and social security but also produce a healthy flow of tax revenue to reduce the federal deficit. And the U.S.'s &quot;baby boomers&quot; are approaching the age at which their acquisitive impluses are being transformed into a propensity to save and invest for eventual retirement.    Taken together, all that means a healthy economy and a booming stock market through at least the early 1990s, Mr. Bhirud argues. &quot;I think 3000 or more on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is easily doable in the next leg,&quot; he says.    Of course, that assumes there isn't a recession this year or next. &quot;That hangs over everything,&quot; he says.    Mr. Bhirud has become more cautious about the near-term outlook for the economy and the stock market because he thinks the risk of inflation -- and the possibility that the Fed will overreact and tighten the money supply enough to start a recession -- is high now. That's because the economy is approaching full employment, production is bumping up against capacity in several industries, and prices of imports are rising as a consequence of the weaker dollar.    But the inflation risk is likely to begin easing soon, he says, as heavily indebted consumers begin pulling back and corporations discover that they will gain more world-wide market share by building advanced factories than by taking over existing companies.    In any event, Mr. Bhirud is confident enough of his longer-term outlook that he would view any further fall in stock prices as an invitation to buy.    &quot;If in the middle of this summer the stock market is testing its lows and the world is throwing in the towel, my view would force me to say this is a buying opportunity,&quot; he says.    ---   Friday Market Activity   Stock prices retreated in thin pre-holiday trading, as only dividend-related activity kept the session from being the slowest of the year.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.31 points to 1956.44. Despite the decline, the average ended the week with an advance of 3.84 points, or 0.2%.    New York Stock Exchange volume was 133.6 million shares, off from Thursday's 164.3 million. Two high-yielding utility stocks -- Duquesne Light and Texas Utilities -- accounted for more than 43 million of Friday's total. Decliners led advancers by a 777-618 margin.    Among active issues, Texaco, which rejected Carl Icahn's takeover offer, eased 3/8 to 49 5/8. Burlington Northern climbed 6 to 66 3/4, and Polaroid added 1 3/4 to 33 1/2 on rumors of restructurings.    Macmillan gained 2 3/8 to 72 1/2 in brisk trading fueled by speculation that it is about to begin a leveraged buyout at $80 to $81 a share.    Huffy dropped 3 1/2 to 21. It said it expects second-quarter net income to fall short of last year's record 71 cents a share.    Maxus Energy advanced 1 1/2 to 8 1/2 after rising 5/8 Thursday. Analysts said the company could be close to making an announcement about a sale of a large part of its Indonesian oil reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
