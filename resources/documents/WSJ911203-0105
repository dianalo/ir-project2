In a switch from last year's changes in the code,the feds' government's primary aim this season is to give(back) rather than receive.   Surely some will find coal in what ultimately emerges fromthe Corridors of Power. Less certain is whether any tax cutswill be well targeted at what fundamentally ails the economy,job scarcity.</LP><TEXT>   Employment anxiety is clearly a key to confidence, andsour spirits are what have turned a pause into a panic. Thisis new stuff for policy makers schooled in inventoryrecessions, or ones caused by a price spike (a la OPEC) thatrequired the sticky parts of the economy to be greased.   Prices are a factor this time, to the extent that fallingproperty values lead to less consumer spending. Some havesuggested expanding the money supply to bring on assetappreciation in the current emergency. This policy wasrejected in the course of other sectoral deflations (farming,energy) in the 1980s, and is an awkward way to prevent abanking calamity, if bad loans pose that threat.   Maybe tax changes, then? The implication might be that the1986 tax law, once considered a crowning achievement ofReaganomics, is somehow responsible for this recession. Someof its changes were silly, but if lower marginal tax rates onincome aren't the cornerstone of economic growth, where arewe?   In fact, it's an incentivist saw -- tax something andyou'll get less of it -- that is as relevant as ever in thejobs debate. To put more people on payrolls, make it easierto do so. Not through special credits, or the latest versionof jobs programs (the transportation bill), but by curbingthe employment killers that have crept up since the Reaganboom: the add-on expenses for each worker.   Between 1987 and 1991, total compensation per hour workedrose less than 15% in the U.S., according to the Bureau ofLabor Statistics (BLS). But the share of that cost outside ofbasic wages and salaries -- the health, retirement and otherobligations of the employer -- grew at a faster clip, and islikely to rise even more quickly as things now stand.   The biggest leap in benefit costs, to no one's surprise,occurred in insurance, mostly medical. Its share of the totalpayroll pie increased by more than 20%, according to the BLS.This cost varies widely among companies and industries, andamong studies of the issue. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce surveyof 1,000 member firms found that in 1990, employer medicalcosts were 9.9% of payroll. (Both the BLS and the EmployeeBenefits Research Institute show a smaller number.) To puttoday's costs in historical perspective, the Chamber notes,&quot;The 1990 increase of $231 for medical and dental insurancepremiums {per employee is} only $29 less than the $260 spentby employers for health and life insurance in 1969.&quot;   Legislation to discipline costs or prevent their beingshifted from nonpaying patients to the insured is iffy. Morelikely, employers will look to self-insuring (as 59% alreadydo), with the leeway to cap exposures apparently allowedunder last week's federal appeals court ruling out of NewOrleans. But then the lawmakers probably will try tocounteract the judiciary on that score, just as they arelikely to crimp the option to hire part-timers who aren'teligible for benefits.   The next biggest component of the BLS's payroll pains isworkers' compensation. This scam varies by state, dependingon how many lawyers are in residence and how much slack isgiven physicians who make a living by telling juries aboutsuffering on the job. In California, which is having one ofthe worst employment falloffs and not coincidentally is aworkers' comp playground, the &quot;forensic doctors&quot; actually gotmore from the game in 1990 than did the attorneys.   The federal government itself was the No. 3 payroll-costpusher with its rising Social Security (plus Medicare) tax.This, too, is destined to go up and up, unless one of theschemes to reduce it (temporarily) is enacted. Those whodesigned the increases said they were needed to build asurplus for paying future benefits. Now it appears that wasonly a whoopee cushion: Receipts trail projections and --guess what] -- pay-outs exceed expectations. So SocialSecurity, despite the bailout, will be at least partly apay-as-you-go welfare program in the out years, unless itwere somehow privatized soon. Thus, the case for bearing thecross now is no longer such a clean one, and a lowering ofthis heavy tax on working people -- half of it exacted viatheir employers -- may be possible.   Elsewhere on the payroll front, there's little hope forsavings. Some cost components actually fell between 1987 and1991, but they are more likely to move up now. Retirementcontributions were diminished because of robust investmentperformance and a move to self-directed pensions. This week'sissue of Barron's argues that future retirees are gettingshorted. State unemployment-insurance taxes dropped becauseof low joblessness. That will reverse now -- Michigan's ratejust was doubled. Paid time off the job has been steady, butnew mandated leave could change that.   All these costs amount to at least 20% of total payrollexpense, up from 9% in 1960. They run as high as 30% in theChamber survey, including understated benefits to retirees.As the chart shows, this burden on business is creeping upagain, even as the interest expense on corporate borrowingtrails off thanks to lower rates (see accompanyingillustration -- WSJ Dec. 3, 1991).   Not counted here are intangibles the boss assumes eachtime a worker is added, including the possibility of job biaslitigation and theft by the employee. Even with out thosevariables, it's easy to see why the Chamber doesn't expecthiring to reach its mid-1990 level again until late 1992.   It's always possible that the payroll add-ons simply getsubtracted from whatever wages and salaries would otherwisebe paid, and that the employer's net cost is zero. As intracing who actually pays various taxes -- companies orconsumers, for example -- this is contentious territory.Either way, the present and future worker can be worse off.Either he gets less take-home pay, or he risks joblessnessbecause employers have to cut back.   One happy element of the payroll crisis is that stategovernments are in a position to act on it: Except on SocialSecurity, they needn't wait for Washington. In the heightenedcompetition to keep and attract business, perhaps they willplay Rudolph and guide the congressional sleigh.</TEXT></DOC>
