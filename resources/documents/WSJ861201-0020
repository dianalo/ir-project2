McCarthyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women executives have made significant salary and career gains since 1980, but they still have a long way to go, a new survey shows.    According to a study of women executives at the nation's Fortune 1000 companies, women from the vice president's level on up earn only about half as much as their male counterparts. The survey, conducted by Heidrick andamp; Struggles Inc., an executive-search consulting firm, shows the average salary this year for women employed at the vice president level or higher is $124,623; last year, in a separate survey, the search firm found that their male counterparts averaged $213,000.    Nonetheless, the survey shows sizable gains since 1980, the last time Heidrick andamp; Struggles did a similar study. This year, the typical female officer's cash compensation is $116,810. In 1980, less than 10% of the group earned that much.    What's more, four out of five women surveyed have reached the level of vice president or above; in 1980, only one-third had. The overwhelming majority of respondents were promoted from within their companies.    The study paints a picture of female executives who are somewhat different from their male counterparts. According to the study, the typical female executive is 44 years old, white and Protestant, and has no children. She thinks many high-achieving women forgo children to stay on the corporate fast track. Forty-one percent of the women are unmarried, compared with only 7.5% of the men.    She works 55 hours a week at the office, but isn't always happy with what she gets for it. More than half the women officers said they believe women are increasingly becoming self-employed because of managers' continued &quot;discomfort&quot; with women in executive posts.    Nonetheless, she wouldn't stay at home even if she were paid her full salary to do so.    The women find that their high rank sometimes causes conflicts with spouses. One of five married female executives resolves relocation conflicts by allowing the spouse with the higher pay to govern those decisions. But of those earning more than $160,000, one of four solves those problems with a commuter marriage.    Forty-two percent of the women said there should be a national parental leave policy guaranteeing mothers or fathers their jobs if they take time off to be with their newborn infants, but 40% disagreed.    The women surveyed most frequently cited Katharine Graham, chairman and chief executive officer of Washington Post Co., as the &quot;most influential woman in American business today.&quot;    Heidrick andamp; Struggles based its results on responses from about half of the 412 women sent questionnaires. It expects to release the survey tomorrow. </TEXT></DOC>
