Kennedy, chairman of the Tri-County Commuter Rail Organization,said passenger totals should grow as communities improve busconnections and traffic worsens on Interstate 95.   The 67-mile train line was born as an answer to traffic problemsexpected during almost five years of planned construction to widenI-95 between Boca Raton and Miami.   But officials hope it will become popular enough to survivebeyond that.   The federal government provided 90 percent of the $118 millionneeded for the trains, with the state and local governments pickingup the rest. Federal transportation officials are carefully watchingthe project, the largest of several in the nation using existingAmtrak or freight tracks to create commuter lines.   The track record on mass transit in South Florida is not good.Metrorail, a $1 billion elevated railway system in Dade County, hasfailed to attract many riders.   Commuter Bill Morgan said he was riding because ``the drivers inSouth Florida are the worst I've ever known.''   Adam White, a commuter who boarded in Palm Beach County, saidriding the train ``is less stressful. You can think more ... planthe week more.''   Kennedy said he hopes to see the daily passenger total grow to14,000 in three years.   He said he knew of only two problems Monday morning: amalfunctioning switch that delayed a train 20 minutes; and a 20 mphspeed limit on a stretch of track in Dade County that needs to belifted.   Longer range problems include an $800,000 station near the FortLauderdale airport that may be torn down because it is directlyunderneath the flight path of planes and a shortage of bus serviceto many of the stations.   No fares will be charged for riding the train until May 1, when aone-way trip of any length will cost $2.</TEXT></DOC>
