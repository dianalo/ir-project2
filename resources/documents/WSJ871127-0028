The bank's executive-committee president, John Dils, said that the fiscal year was marked by a &quot;substantial&quot; rise in deposits and a &quot;notable&quot; increase in loans to the private sector.    Mr. Dils said the bank won't have to build up any special provisions in the wake of the plunge on world stock markets. He noted that Belgian law doesn't allow banks to make long-term investments in commercial and industrial companies. </TEXT></DOC>
