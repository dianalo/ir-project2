On Wednesday, GMAC became the first frequent U.S. corporate user of the Eurobond markets to announce that it has no &quot;present intention&quot; of calling issues by a Netherlands Antilles subsidiary.    That move seemed to pay off, as investors snapped up the company's 8 1/4%, three-year offering, led by Salomon Brothers International.    Conservative pricing undoubtedly also helped. The issue's spread of 62 basis points over U.S. Treasurys matched that of GMAC paper outstanding and comparable bonds by Ford Motor Credit Co. A basis point is 1/100 of a percent.    But the major lesson, contended Salomon officials and other dealers, was that carefully managed launches of U.S. corporate issues still are feasible, even in the recent climate of wariness over Netherlands Antilles bonds.    The Antilles situation was caused by the U.S. Treasury Department's announcement June 29 that it was ending a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles that had exempted pre-mid-1984 bonds issued through Antilles financing subsidiaries from withholding tax.    The Treasury is now expected to announce that it will keep the portion of the treaty that exempted the bonds from withholding.    Elsewhere in the Eurobond market, Sumitomo Trust andamp; Banking Co. led what is expected to be the first in a series of equity-related offerings by various Japanese banks, which are under pressure from the Japanese government to increase their capitalization ratios.    Sumitomo's $100 million of 15-year convertible Eurobonds indicated a semiannual 1 3/4% coupon at par.    In other syndications, Daewoo Corp., a large Korean concern in markets ranging from electronics to construction, reportedly will launch today $175 million of eight-year floating-rate notes, paying 3/16 over the six-month London interbank offered rate.    The issue is significant in that there have been few Eurobond offerings by Korean companies. Daewoo, like other Korean borrowers, is believed to be aiming at bolstering its name recognition in European markets to open the way to future offerings. </TEXT></DOC>
