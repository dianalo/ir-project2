This scheme creates openspace zones or greenbelts where development is off limits; it promises toprevent sprawl by forcing building into existing communities, where transit isavailable and no new infrastructure is required.;   When growth managementlegislation is considered next year, some type of urban-limit line proposal isexpected to be part of the legislative package.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEBATE BUILDS OVER GROWTH MANAGEMENT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Real Estate; Bradley Inman is an Oakland-based real estate writer.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But critics -- primarily home builders -- charge that this in-fill approachhas one major drawback: How does a growth management plan that is pinned ongreenbelts ensure that the state's housing needs are met within urban areas?;  &quot;It sounds good, but in the final analysis, there will be no affordablehousing under this scenario,&quot; said Gregory McWilliams, vice president ofKaufman andamp; Broad in Los Angeles.;   For an industry that thrives on exurban andsuburban locations, the politics of building housing on in-fill locations isintimidating. Residents in built-up communities shun growth and are oftenorganized into neighborhood groups that know how to stop development. Plus,urban land is more expensive and, therefore, in-fill development oftenrequires high-density housing, which is unpopular in established communities.;  Nevertheless, Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to address the issue when heunveils a comprehensive growth management plan in January. Administrationofficials have said privately that the state's real estate developmentpatterns must be re-examined. Unchecked sprawl into rural locations aggravatestraffic problems and requires greater state spending from an already-squeezedhighway budget, they say.;   Support for in-fill; As the Legislature gears upto debate growth management, there are signs that the in-fill philosophy isgathering steam among a wide variety of interest groups.;   Supported by majorindustrial companies and labor groups, the California Council forEnvironmental and Economic Balance recently released a report recommendingstate guidelines for &quot;where development should be discouraged,&quot; such as areasthat lack public services.;   But supporters of in-fill concede that such aplan must provide certainty that the state's housing needs will be met inurban centers.;   Proposals; Several proposals have been discussed.;   (check)Create an appeals mechanism for housing projects that are turned down by localofficials.;   (check) Recast the role of local redevelopment agencies, whichwere created by state law 42 years ago and charged with rebuilding blightedareas with new hotels, office buildings and other commercial development.;  (check) To overcome the outcry from neighborhood organizations, environmentalgroups that support the greenbelt strategy should become advocates for in-fillhousing developments.;   Without grass-roots support and leadership from thestate's political leaders such as Governor Wilson, the urban limit-line ideawill give way to more sprawl.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bradley Inman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911012  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  468  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 12, 199100286010,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
