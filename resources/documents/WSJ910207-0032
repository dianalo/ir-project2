The reason is that multistate bank holding companies,which sprang up as a result of changes in state laws in theearly 1980s, now must maintain separate bank subsidiaries --with separate administrative structures -- in each state.Eliminating that requirement could mean significant savingsfor the holding companies.</LP><TEXT>   The prospect of reducing costs and improving profits hasled many regional bankers to drop their opposition tointerstate branch operations. Another factor that makes theprospect less frightening to executives of smaller banks isthat many big banks that once had dreams of buildingcoast-to-coast branch networks are choking on a glut of badloans and will be unable to expand aggressively.   &quot;I think that the reason the politics on interstatebranching have changed so much in the last five years is thatthe regional multibank holding companies in the Southeasthave realized how inefficient their structures are,&quot; saidKaren Shaw, president of the Institute for StrategyDevelopment, a Washington-based bank consulting firm. &quot;Ithink a lot of those CEOs are getting tired of going to 15board meetings a month,&quot; she said.   But while the interstate branching proposal pleased manybankers, they were less supportive of the Treasury's plan togrant banks limited powers to sell insurance. Banks wouldlike to &quot;cross-sell&quot; insurance, meaning that loan officerscould pitch insurance policies to borrowers, but the Treasurydidn't propose lifting the current ban on such activities.   Though interstate branching might eventually spur mergersof currently unaffiliated banks or bank holding companiesacross state lines, the potential cost savings would besignificantly less in those cases, bank analysts, consultantsand investment bankers said.   James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; WoodsInc., a securities firm specializing in bank stocks, said: &quot;Ithink the biggest impact of interstate branching would befelt by the likes of a First Interstate Bancorp or First BankSystem Inc. or Norwest Corp. If they were able and inclinedto collapse their cost structure into a branching system,there could be considerable expense savings.&quot;   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said BankAmerica Corp.,which owns big banks in California and Washington, estimatesthat it could save $50 million a year if it were allowed toconsolidate operations. A BankAmerica spokesman confirmed thesavings estimate.   First Bank System, a Minneapolis-based holding companythat operates 34 banks in seven states, said it would &quot;take avery hard look&quot; at consolidating its various banksubsidiaries if the current law is changed.   &quot;There clearly are some efficiencies that are available tous operating as one bank that aren't available under thecurrent environment,&quot; its vice chairman, William Farley,said.   But not all multistate banking companies are ready toforce such consolidations.   Banc One Corp., a Columbus, Ohio, company with 52 banks insix states, says it likes that arrangement.   &quot;We believe strongly in running our banks on anindependent basis in each of the markets that they serve,&quot; aBanc One spokesman said. &quot;While we centralize {back office}operations and technical functions, the `people side' of ourbusiness is decentralized to the city level.&quot;   James McCormick, president of First Manhattan ConsultingGroup, which specializes in the banking industry, estimatesthat a 10% cost reduction at a typical bank could improve itsearnings enough to cause a 50% increase in the bank's stockprice.   If interstate branching is allowed, Mr. McCormick said, &quot;Iwould not see a landslide of new acquisitions. I would seethat as an important element that will allow banks to operateon a more systematic basis and make significant expensereductions, which are massively needed. It's important overthe longer term.&quot;   Ms. Shaw predicts that if Congress makes any structuralchanges in the banking system this year, it will change thelaw that prohibits banks from having branches in more thanone state. However, she also expects that Congress willinsert a provision, not included in the Treasury planunveiled Tuesday, giving states the right to bar interstatebranching.   The fate of the Treasury's proposal to allow banks to selland underwrite insurance, subject to restrictions by thestates, is viewed as more uncertain.   In all but 16 states, banks aren't allowed to sellinsurance, and the Treasury doesn't propose to override thosebans. In most states, current laws would also preventcross-selling, in which a banker making an auto loan mightsuggest that a customer buy auto insurance from the bank'saffiliated insurance company.   Large banks are generally interested in setting upoperations to both sell and underwrite insurance. Smallbanks, however, are mainly interested in setting up insurancebrokerage firms that would generate commission revenuewithout exposing the banks to the risks of underwritinginsurance and having to pay big claims.   For most banks, the prohibition on cross-selling wouldlimit the appeal of the insurance business. Many bankersbelieve their advantage in the insurance business would liein cross-selling deposit accounts and life insuranceproducts, such as annuities.</TEXT></DOC>
