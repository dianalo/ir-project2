Constitution: In a spent fuelstorage facility, atmospheric air intrudes into a small chamber of abuilding opened at the upper portion, and enters through an atmosphericair inlet to an outside flow channel. Then, the atmospheric air is guidedthrough a communication aperture formed in the central portion of a airvent channel cover to the inside of an inner flow channel. The atmosphericair flowing into the inner flowing channel directly cools the outer surfaceof a spent fuel storage pot and, as the result, its temperature is elevatedand specific gravity is decreased. Then, the air is flown upwardly, andthen released by way of the external exit and a draft chimney into theatmosphere. Since the spent fuel storage pot and the building can becooled by the repeating natural convection of atmospheric air, thereis no requirement for disposing water pool facility and relevent poolwater cooling and purifying systems.
