Since the late 1970s, the situation has changedfrom limited proven reserves and deliverability, and a fear of potentialsupply shortage to one of today's significant surplus situation. Oneof the prime reasons was that of price. The rising world energy pricesof the late 70s saw the wellhead price for natural gas rise dramaticallyin Canada and the US. It became profitable to explore for and developnatural gas reserves, and therefore deliverability was enhanced. As wellexpectations of world energy shortages with high energy prices has changedto a situation where these higher price expectations resulted in explorationactivity which brought the world markets vast new energy supplies. Theresult is a substantial surplus of natural gas and increased competitionfrom low cost world crude oil. At the same time, consumers looked toways of reducing their energy and natural gas needs. As a result, naturalgas demand dropped in the US from the 21 TCF range in the late 70s tothe 16 TCF range in the mid 80s. Supply shortage became surplus accompaniedby a drop in market demand. Government regulatory changes have resultedin open competition, negotiated price, quick short term arrangements,revised exportable surplus, and specific export hearings. Innovationsseen by the author as needed within the industry include purchasing gasat the wellhead, fixed prices, rate of take, and marketing methods.</TEXT></DOC>
