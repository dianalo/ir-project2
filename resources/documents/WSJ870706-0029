A Union spokesman said the reorganization reflects the company's inability to &quot;reconcile&quot; its strategy of building a large energy company with continuing to pay an annual dividend of 80 Canadian cents (60.1 U.S. cents) a share, a goal that was established when Union was exclusively a gas utility.    Unicorp Canada Corp. owns 60% of Union.    Under the plan, Union's non-utility assets, which consist mainly of oil and gas holdings, would be transferred to Unicorp. Union holders other than Unicorp would exchange each of their common shares for one new preference share and one warrant of Unigas Corp., a new company that would own Union Gas Ltd., Union's gas utility unit. Unicorp would own all of the Unigas common. The new Unigas preference shares would be valued at 13.10 dollars each and pay an annual dividend of 95 cents a share.    Union Enterprises has about 34 million common shares outstanding. On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, Union closed at 12.25 dollars, up 12.5 cents.    The Union spokesman said directors have been reluctant to reduce the dividend rate even though the company paid about 27 million dollars in common dividends last year, when it earned 32.5 million dollars from operations.    In 1985, Union Gas reorganized as a holding company, Union Enterprises, to pursue acquisitions. In the reorganization, the gas utility became a subsidiary, and the rest of the company was freed from utility regulation. Unicorp acquired control of Union soon after the reorganization. </TEXT></DOC>
