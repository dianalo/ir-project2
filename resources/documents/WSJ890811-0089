After being let in by a pleasant-looking doorman with a submachine gun &quot;hidden&quot; in his left inside coat pocket, I was led to the living room where the congressman's 19-year-old daughter, Soledad, was recounting the day's events.    Less than an hour earlier, as she was coming out of a bank in a Lima suburb, two men had pushed a gun into her back and forced her into a car. A hood was placed over her head, and she was addressed by name: &quot;Soledad, you had better be careful.&quot; The assailants clearly were not after her money, as they did not even check her pockets. Nor did they attempt to abuse her physically. After a 20-minute car ride, the young woman was abandoned in another part of Lima by her assailants.    Soledad's father, Manuel Piqueras, is head of a congressional commission formed to investigate the Rodrigo Franco Command, a paramilitary band of vigilantes presumed to be responsible for her abduction. In inflation- and violence-ridden Peru, the Rodrigo Franco Command is merely another actor in what increasingly resembles a tragicomedy. But its emergence adds a frightening new twist to the increasingly Lebanese-like situation here: The command purportedly has links to high-ranking members of President Alan Garcia's government, Mr. Garcia's APRA Party, and segments of the police and armed forces. The very legitimacy of Peru's judicial and political institutions is at stake.    Peru already claimed two major guerrilla groups, the Castroite Tupac Amaru movement (MRTA), and the far more violent &quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot; -- Shining Path. The Shining Path guerrilla movement has claimed more than 15,000 lives since it launched activities in 1980. Its vision for Peru is an apocalyptic one, blending Gang-of-Four Maoism with a &quot;back to the Incas&quot; vision of society -- a vision that involves the destruction of all institutions and members of society that are non-Indian in origin. Since the 1985 elections, Shining Path has effectively sabotaged all development efforts in the Andean region, and has killed 45 mayors, a direct threat to the coming municipal elections in November. The army has grown increasingly impatient with the government's failure to adopt a coherent counterinsurgency policy, as well as with a drastic shortage of funds. Army officers in some of the emergency zones were rumored so short of funds that they could not buy boots. The air force, meanwhile, is forced to contract its helicopters out for private flights in order to cover costs. The counterterrorist intelligence agency, &quot;Dircote&quot;, is extremely frustrated with a judicial system that it believes is too lenient with terrorist suspects. In the words of one former Dircote agent: &quot;All of our exhaustive and patient work . . . disintegrated in midair when it reached the hands of the judges.&quot;    In July 1988, Sendero's supposed No. 2, Osman Morote, was captured and tried, but was found not guilty on several counts of terrorism. On July 28, Osman Morote's defense lawyer, Manuel Febres, was kidnapped and murdered. A group calling itself the &quot;Comando Rodrigo Franco&quot; -- named after a promising young APRA official killed by Sendero in August 1987 -- took responsibility.    The command has been most active in the emergency zones that are under military control. It seems highly organized and secretive and clearly has access to intelligence information and sophisticated weapons, such as East German silencers that are normally used only by the military. It almost always claims responsibility for its assaults, and targets not only Sendero sympathizers but anyone who criticizes the government.    Among its most infamous actions are:    --The murder of Ayacucho journalist Juvenal Farfan, his wife and two children;    --The dynamiting of the home of Oiga magazine editor Francisco Igartua, a conservative critic of the government;    --The bombing of the tomb of a famous Ayacucho Senderista, Edith Lagos;    --The murder of MRTA member Luis Miguel Pasake;    --The murder of the head of the powerful anti-government miner's union, Saul Cantoral.    Although the crimes display the characteristics of terrorist assaults, all of the crimes committed by the command have been processed by the Homicide Division of the Police Services. Its investigations have not led to the detention of a single suspected member of the command. Protection requested by individuals receiving threats has not been extended.    Much of the speculation about government involvement with the command centers on the Ministry of the Interior and its new minister, Agustin Mantilla. In May 1986, an executive Supreme Decree gave the ministry authority to approve budgets and obtain weapons for the expansion of &quot;internal civil defense.&quot; Mr. Mantilla, who was vice minister at the time, allegedly became personally involved in importing huge shipments of arms, apparently without the approval or knowledge of the joint armed forces command.    In October 1986, reporters received a tip about a shipment of 10,000 Kalashnikov rifles, 300 machine guns and 6.6 million pounds of ammunition from North Korea, which they discovered being unloaded from the ship El Maranon at the port of Callao. Another large cache of weapons from North Korea -- mislabeled as &quot;batteries and parts&quot; -- was discovered on the ship Sabagal in March 1988 by Oiga magazine reporters. Mr. Mantilla's brother, Coco, reportedly was seen directing the offloading of the second shipment. Although he is not an official member of the ministry, he has been given a special license to import arms and is allegedly responsible for mislabeling the Sabagal shipment. Promised investigations of the scandals have not been pursued by the government.    On Oct. 2, 1987, a car exploded outside the pro-Sendero newspaper, El Diario. Two of the three youths in the car were killed, and one survived. All three were members of the APRA youth. The survivor, Jaime Rios Saenz, was taken to a police hospital and given priority treatment under direct orders from the Interior Ministry. His whereabouts remain unknown, and there has been no progress made on judicial proceedings for the case.    The congressional commission appointed in June to investigate the command and its alleged links to the Interior Ministry is unlikely to turn up anything implicating APRA; Congress appointed an Aprista, Abdon Vilchez Melo, as its head. Also, the seven-member commission has little funding and virtually no protection. The assault on Mr. Piqueras's daughter was clearly an attempt to dissuade him from continuing the investigation. The daunting task for those like Mr. Piqueras, who seek to support political and judicial institutions in this troubled nation, is to make sure that the term &quot;Peruvianization&quot; does not vie with &quot;Lebanonization&quot; as a code word for a nation's demise.    ---   Ms. Graham is a research fellow in foreign-policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
