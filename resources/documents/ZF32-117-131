(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Excel 3.0 is more than just an upgrade of the most popular spreadsheetprogram for the Mac.andP;  Innovative new tools boost Excel's data-analysis power,and the program's presentation-quality output gains more polish.andP;  But best ofall, these considerable enhancements haven't decreased the program'saccessibility.andP;  In fact, the new version of Excel is easier to use than itspredecessors.andM;One-Stop Tool BarandM;The first readily apparent change to Excel is the new tool bar, which extendsbeneath the main menu headings.andP;  The tool bar provides handy, one-stopshopping for commonly used spreadsheet functions.andP;  For example, rather thanrequiring several steps to sum a row or column of numbers, Excel 3.0 lets youclick once on the Autosum button.andP;  Autosum is smart enough to analyze yourdata and select the numbers either above or to the left of the active cellfor summation.andP;  With tool-bar functions, you can also set cell formatting andalignment.andP;  position a chart.andP;  add a text block, or use a marquee to selectgraphics objects in a worksheet.andM;An innovative addition is Excel 3.0's outlining, capability, which lets yououtline your data much as you outline text with a word processor.andP;  If youhave many levels of information on a worksheet, for example, you can organizeit hierarchically so that detail data is subordinated to the correspondingsummary rows.andP;  You can organize your data outline manually, or you can letExcel automatically create the appropriate categories and subcategories of aselected range for you-which it does very well.andP;  The program supports eightlevels of outline in all.andM;Once you've created an outline, you can expand and collapse it to show thevarious levels of detail, using the outline icons.andP;  This provides a terrificmethod for quickly and easily creating a variety of summary reports.andP;  A hostof other improvements to version 3.0 make Excel more accessible to novicesand more convenient for power users.andP;  If you've ever fussed with sizingcolumn widths for a worksheet, for example, you'll welcome the way version3.0 handles sizing.andP;  You double-click on a column border, and Excel thenfinds the widest element in the column and sets the width accordingly.andP;  Youcan even highlight multiple columns that require different widths, and Excelwill set them all to the correct size automatically.andM;If you've ever miscalculated the number of rows or columns needed toaccommodate the data before pasting it in to your worksheet, you'llappreciate a new option that creates the appropriate number of cellsautomatically.andM;Another handy feature is the Add button in the Define Names dialog box, whichlets you define range names more quickly than you could in earlier versions.andO;However, although you can drag the dialog box around within the worksheet toget a better view of the ranges you're looking for, you can't actually selectranges from within the worksheet while you're accessing the dialog box.andP;  Thismeans that most range names created by use of the Add button are likely torefer to simple ranges or constants,andM;Excel 3.0 no longer makes you plod back and forth from Print Preview to yourworksheets in order to fine-tune the final appearance of your worksheets.andP;  Inearlier versions of Excel, Print Preview let you view documents but wouldn'tlet you make any changes to them.andP;  The new Print Preview lets you changecolumn widths and set margins without returning to your worksheet.andM;3-D ChartsandM;Excel was the first spreadsheet program to integrate a solid charting tool,and the new version continues to build on this strength.andP;  There are 24 new3-D-chart options in version 3.0, including area, column, line, and piecharts.andM;With version 3.0, you can at last combine text, worksheets, and charts on asingle page, as well as place more than one chart on a page, to create trulyinformative reports.andM;The program also provides drawing tools for creating lines, arrows,rectangles, ovals, and arcs on worksheets.andP;  Graphics objects created withExcel's new drawing tools are attached to the underlying cells.andP;  This meansthat when the cells shift, the objects move or change size with them.andP;  Youcan also choose to detach objects from underlying cells if you don't wantthem altered.andM;In Excel 3.0, you can use pasted graphics as chart units, stacking orstretching the graphics to fit the corresponding data.andP;  You can even playwith your data graphically by altering charts with the mouse.andP;  Results arereflected in the corresponding worksheet.andM;Excel 3.0 has style sheets that mimic those of Microsoft Word.andP;  You can namecombinations of number format, font, alignment, border setting, patternsetting, and cell protection and then apply those settings without repeatedreturns to the Format menu.andP;  A nice finishing touch is a button that lets youcopy any predefined style into the current worksheet.andM;Version 3.0 delivers several enhancements specifically designed for powerusers.andP;  If you've been waiting for a way to consolidate your worksheets, forinstance, the wait is over.andP;  With Excel 3.0, you can combine data from anunlimited number of worksheets as well as from different ranges within thesame worksheet.andP;  You can also consolidate by using links that update yoursummaries as you edit values.andP;  Excel even consolidates worksheets withdifferent row and column positions, as long as they have consistent labeling.andM;For what-if analysis, Excel 3.0 supplies a powerful new tool called the GoalSeek function.andP;  Goal Seek lets you calculate the input values necessary todrive a formula to a specified value without making you use trial and error.andO;For example, the function can provide the monthly sales revenues needed tomaintain a 6-percent profit margin when your monthly overhead is  1,800.andM;The separate Solver application takes Excel's analytical powers even further.andO;The Solver calculates solutions to problems that use multiple variables basedon the same formulas.andP;  For example, you can use the Solver to calculate aquarterly advertising budget that optimizes profits for the year.andM;For those who depend heavily on macros, version 3.0 offers several usefulimprovements.andP;  Perhaps the most significant is the ability to create astartup folder for Excel.andP;  You can create a special macro sheet named ExcelStartup that loads whenever you launch Excel.andP;  There's also a new macro-sheetformat called Add In that opens macro sheets invisibly and adds theirfunctionality to Excel, just as if they were built in.andM;Setting UpandM;Excel 3.0 and all its support files require more than 4 megabytes of diskspace for installation.andP;  Fortunately, you don't have to install everything.andO;If you're an experienced user, for example, you can save 770K by notinstalling the program's tutorial.andM;Excel's documentation is better organized this time around, so it's easier tofind what you're looking for.andP;  The Help system is also effective, butunfortunately it loses its place as you navigate through it: Click on atopic, read it, and press the Back button, and the first topic in the list ishighlighted rather than the section you just completed.andM;You also can't print the Help screens from Excel.andP;  Although this may beenvironmentally correct, it can be truly frustrating, because you can't leavethe Help screen open as you try out the prescribed steps.andM;The Bottom LineandM;With the addition of the tool bar and numerous other interface enhancements,Excel 3.0 succeeds in being more accessible to novices and more convenientfor experienced Excel users.andM;Moreover, unique features such as the Solver and the outliner providefunctionality that no other Mac spreadsheet program offers.andP;  The long waitfor significant Microsoft Excel upgrades can often be frustrating-version 3.0was in the works for almost two years - but the result is well worth thewait.andP;  Each new version of Excel has included impressive, innovativefeatures.andP;  Excel 3.0 is no exception.andM;- Louis E.
