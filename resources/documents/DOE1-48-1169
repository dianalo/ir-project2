The concept utilizes a delta-wing turbine design usingsimple-to-build flat plate blades which can be made from steel, plywoodor fabric-covered frames. The design further uses low rotor speeds toavoid rotor stress, and achieves maximum torque when the rotor is notmoving (zero speed). This allows the unit to start under load withoutneeding a clutch. These two features are suitable for direct water pumping,whereas high-speed low-torque rotors are more suitable for generatingelectricity. In 1978 Abacus Engineering and Machine Ltd. agreed to buildand test large-scale wind turbines based on this design. Performancetesting was conducted, along with an economic assessment, indicatingthat the turbine could be cost competitive rich with water pumps poweredelectricity or driven by engines fueled by natural gas, propane or diesel.The turbine was also compared with four other commercially availablemachines and the results indicated that its design was marginally moreeconomic over 6 months of operating time and better on an annual basis.</TEXT></DOC>
