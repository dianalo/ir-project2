The carriers said cutbacks in their management ranksprevented them from trying to maintain limited service withsupervisory personnel. &quot;We simply don't have the number ofsupervisors to run the trains,&quot; said Michael Walsh, chairmanof Union Pacific Corp.'s rail unit.</LP><TEXT>   But labor leaders said the railroads' decision promptedCongress to act quickly to settle the strike and adoptrecommendations made by a presidential board in January. Theboard's recommendations for changes in wages, health benefitsand work rules are more popular with management, while railunions call the changes damaging.   Shippers generally said their pre-strike preparations foralternate transport would protect them if the rail shutdowndoesn't last more than a few days. Electric utilities saidthey could weather a long rail strike, because their coalstockpiles are at unusually high levels. But automobilemakers said they already had to curtail some operationsbecause of a shortage of parts that normally arrive by rail.   Commuter trains in New York and Chicago ran regularschedules yesterday, but a San Francisco commuter line wasshut down, affecting about 4,300 riders. Amtrak reportedextensive disruption of its long-distance passenger trains,which operate over the tracks of the freight railroads. Butits Boston-Washington Northeast Corridor and a few other busylines operated without interruption.   A spokeswoman for General Motors Corp. said the company'sassembly plants operated normally yesterday. But she said thecompany expects the rail strike to affect 70% to 80% of itsassembly plants within the next 24 hours and all its assemblyplants by the end of the week. That could lead to reducedwork shifts or shutdowns, she said. Most of the items GMships by rail are heavy parts and materials that would be toodifficult or costly to switch to trucks.   Ford Motor Co. said all but one of its 14 U.S. autoassembly plants weathered the first day of the rail strikewithout serious problems. But its Chicago plant, which buildsFord Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, cut output about 50%,reflecting a shortage of parts and a lack of storage spacewhere it could have built inventories. &quot;It would belogistically impossible to divert all inbound rail shipmentsto truck,&quot; said Bill Anderson, a transportation manager atFord. He added that the strike's effects would become &quot;acute&quot;at other Ford plants by the end of the week.   &quot;If it lasts only two or three days, the rail strike won'tdisrupt much,&quot; said James Bartley, president of the NationalIndustrial Transportation League, a shipper group inWashington. &quot;But if it extends beyond that, the strike wouldreally start to cripple the nation's supply line.&quot;   Chevron Corp.'s Chevron U.S.A. unit said that if thestrike lasts more than six days, its chemical and oiloperations face some closings. Meanwhile, the company'scontingency plans are working. It turned to trucks for someshipments, and it brought extra rail cars into its facilitiesbefore the strike to store raw materials and finished goodstemporarily.   But Marty Javinsky, manager of transportation planning andservices at San Francisco-based Chevron U.S.A., said, &quot;Beyondsix days, it really gets dicey. We could see significantshutdowns,&quot; particularly at its inland refineries that don'thave access to alternate waterborne transportation.   California Steel Industries Inc., a closely held Fontana,Calif., company, is counting on a quick end to the strike. Itneeds to move at least 20,000 tons of steel-slab imports fromthe docks in Long Beach, Calif., to Fontana by tonight. Thecompany hasn't lined up any trucks to move it at $3 a tonmore than rail costs, partly because it expects Congress toend the strike. California Steel hasn't stockpiled slabs,which it uses to make steel sheets for Los Angeles-areacustomers.   Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., said it has been buildinginventories of raw materials in anticipation of a strike. Thecompany uses rail mainly for intra-company transport from onemanufacturing operation to another. &quot;We can take a little bitof disruption, but if the rail strike goes longer than a fewdays we would get into serious difficulty,&quot; said CliffordSayre, vice president, Du Pont materials, logistics andservices.   Du Pont's Consolidation Coal Co. unit is scrambling tofind storage space for the coal it isn't able to ship byrail. It is already storing coal in concrete silos or instockpiles on the ground because of weak demand fromutilities. &quot;At some mines in our system, it won't be morethan a day or two before we'll have to look at a cutback orshutdown,&quot; said Thomas F. Hoffman, a vice president ofConsolidation Coal.   Some shippers have taken aggressive measures to getthrough the strike. Inland Container Corp., a unit ofTemple-Inland Corp., leased a railroad locomotive at itslargest paper-making facility so it can move boxcars on andoff its rail siding as needed. As a result, the company willbe able to load products onto cars that will be ready to gowhen the strike ends.   Asian shippers are adjusting their plans to avoid delayscaused by the strike.   Toyota Motor Co. is switching some loads to truck. As muchas 60% of Toyota's exports to the U.S. from Japan normallyare unloaded at West Coast ports and put on trains for therest of their journey.   Robert Larson, director of Kmart Taiwan Ltd., said he hasbeen instructed to use those ship lines that sail directly toEast Coast ports rather than those that get cargo therethrough a combination of ship and rail. Fortunately, the railstrike comes at a good time for apparel shippers, he said.They have completed their export shipping for the summerseason and won't begin exporting for Christmas until nextmonth.   The strike is giving a boost to railroads' chiefcompetitors, truckers. &quot;We're ecstatic,&quot; said Paul Bergant,executive vice president, marketing, of J.B. Hunt TransportServices Inc., a Lowell, Ark., trucker. Mr. Bergant said thatJ.B. Hunt has picked up additional shipments of paper, autoparts and building materials that normally move on the rails.As a result, the company now is running at 100% of capacity,up from 90% before the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
