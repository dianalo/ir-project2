The accounting standard is related to Consumers Power's attempt to recover all or part of its $2.1 billion investment in the unfinished Midland nuclear power plant from ratepayers. CMS abandoned part of the plant in 1986 because of cost overruns, delays and opposition, and it plans to convert the rest into a gas-fired cogeneration plant. The Michigan Public Service Commission so far has refused to allow CMS to pass on the costs to consumers.    The standard requires Consumers Power to recognize a $600 million balance sheet write-down of its current plant assets. The write-down reflects the difference between the $2.1 billion it has invested in the plant and the current value of the money it seeks in its state agency application to recover over the next 15 years.    The standard will be applied retroactively to 1986, and the company said it will restate its 1986 earnings. For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, CMS had net income of $132.7 million on revenue of $2.86 billion.    The company said the rule also allows it to &quot;reverse&quot; the entire write-down over a 15-year period, and thus boost earnings during those years. In 1988, the company said, this accounting procedure will add $60 million to earnings. The procedure was developed by the Connecticut-based Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets rules for the accounting industry. </TEXT></DOC>
