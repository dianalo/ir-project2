This proposal is prompted by recent legislation which mandatesthat the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) amend the current requirementsfor installation and operation of flight recorders and CVRs aboard aircarrier and commuter air carrier aircraft. Legislation also requires theFAA to consider National Transportation Safety Board recommendations oninstalling flight recorders and CVRs on general aviation aircraft. TheFAA has determined that the investigatory information currently availablefrom accidents involving aircraft not required to be equipped with CVRsand/or flight recorders is insufficient to determine the causes of manyof those accidents. This rulemaking action would, therefore, ensure thatdata eventually used to prevent accidents from recurring are preserved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before March 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments on this notice may be mailed in triplicateto: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attn:Rules Docket (AGC-204), Docket No. 25530, 800 Independence Avenue SW.,Washington, DC 20591.

Distribution System, which described the applicationprocedure.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On December 22, 1987, legislation was enacted compelling the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) to initiate rulemaking proceedings which would expandthe cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight recorder requirements currentlycontained in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Congress stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * [Five] per centum of each sum [for necessary expenses] providedunder this head for the Immediate Office of the Secretary, and the Officeof the General Counsel shall not be available for the obligation untilon or after the date that [a] final rule[] [is] issued by the Departmentof Transportation that * * * expand[s] existing requirements for installationand carriage of cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders to smallersizes of commuter air carrier aircraft and to require cockpit voice recorderand flight data recorder retrofits on certain types of existing commuterair carrier aircraft to be determined by the Federal Aviation Administration.Continuing Resolution (referring to the Department of Transportation andRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988), Pub. L. No. 100-202 (December22, 1987).</ITAG>On December 30, 1987, President Reagan signed the Airport and Airway Safetyand Capacity Expansion Act of 1987. Title III, Section 303(c) of that actstates:<ITAG tagnum="21">COCKPIT VOICE RECORDERS AND FLIGHT DATA RECORDERS_Not later than 120days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary [of Transportation]shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider the use of cockpit voicerecorders and flight data recorders on commuter aircraft and other aircraft,commensurate with the recommendations of the National Transportation SafetyBoard. Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-223, andSection; 303 (December 30, 1987).</ITAG>In light of the recent legislation, and in light of the National TransportationSafety Board's (NTSB) Safety Recommendation letter of June 19, 1987, theFAA reviewed the CVR and flight recorder requirements. The FAA considersthe Safety Recommendation letter of June 19 an appropriate starting point.Since the NTSB issued its last flight recorder recommendations in August1982, a number of significant events have occurred, including the March25, 1987 (52 FR 9622), amendments to 14 CFR 91.35, 121.343, 125.202 and135.151. Other events have necessitated that the FAA reconsider its requirementsas well as the NTSB's recommendations: the technological development ofsolid-state flight data recorders (SFDRs), the continued growth of thecommuter air carrier industry, the recent amendment of 14 CFR Part 23 toprovide for the definition and certification of a commuter category airplane,and the adoption of revised CVR standards and recommendations developedby the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The NTSB alsobelieves its views, which are based on years of experience as the primaryuser of flight recorder information for accident investigation purposes,satisfy the safety objectives of both government and industry.The June 19, 1987, NTSB recommendations proposed two distinct recordergroups: one for airplanes and rotorcraft used in air carrier operations,and one for commuter category and selected smaller aircraft operated under14 CFR Parts 135 and 91, respectively. The proposed requirements pertainingto large airplanes would expand the current requirements (as detailed inAppendix B of 14 CFR Part 121) to include the NTSB's recommendation fornewly manufactured airplanes and existing airplanes equipped with an AeronauticalRadio, Inc. (ARINC) 429 digital data bus or its equivalent. In addition,the recorder requirements of Appendix B would be extended to include Part135 operations with airplanes and rotorcraft capable of carrying 20 passengersor more. Another flight recorder requirement would apply to newly manufactured,multiengine, turbine-powered aircraft capable of carrying 10 or more passengers.It would be required that airplanes be equipped with flight recorders thatat least record the parameters detailed in Appendix B of Part 121. Flightrecorders capable of recording the parameters detailed in Appendix C ofPart 135 would be required on rotorcraft with a 10- to 19-passenger seatingcapacity. On all existing and newly manufactured rotorcraft with a 20-or more passenger seating capacity, flight recorders that at least recordthe parameters detailed in Appendix E of Part 135 would be required.Specifically, the NTSB has stated that the amendments to 14 CFR Parts 91,121, 125 and 135, issued in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 9622, March 25, 1987], were a step inthe right direction, but that additional requirements are needed. The NTSBconsiders that the following requirements are essential to assist themin establishing the probable causes of accidents and to develop recommendationsthat might preclude those types of accidents from recurring:(1) Require that each large airplane (Ref. Federal Aviation Regulation(FAR) andSection; 121.343) that is equipped with a ARINC 429 digital databus or equivalent be retrofitted with a flight recorder capable of recordingthe parameters listed in Appendix B of Part 121.(2) Require that each newly manufactured large airplane (Ref. FAR andSection;121.343) be equipped with a flight recorder capable of recording the parameterslisted in Appendix B of Part 121.(3) Require that each rotorcraft used in scheduled air carrier operations(Ref. FAR Part 135, Subpart A) and each newly manufactured rotorcraft beequipped with a flight recorder capable of recording the parameters listedin Appendix E of Part 135.(4) Require that each newly manufactured, multiengine turbine-powered airplaneor rotorcraft capable of carrying 10 to 19 passengers, brought onto theU.S. register, be equipped with a flight recorder capable of recordingthe parameters listed in Appendix B (airplanes) or Appendix C (rotorcraft)of Part 135.(5) Require that each multiengine, turbine-powered airplane or rotorcarftcapable of carrying 6 or more passengers and for which two pilots are requiredfor any type of operation (14 CFR Parts 91, 121, or 135), be equipped witha CVR.(6) Require that each airplane or rotorcraft capable of carrying 20 ormore passengers (Ref. 14 CFR 135.2) be equipped with a flight recordercapable of recording the parameters listed in Appendix B of Part 121, anda CVR (Ref. FAR andSection; 135.151).(7) Require that each multiengine, turbine-powered airplane or rotorcraftcapable of carrying 10 or more passengers and operating under part 91 beequipped with a flight recorder capable of recording the parameters listedin Appendix B (airplanes) and Appendix C (rotorcraft) of Part 135.(8) Require that the design of any new aircraft (see 14 CFR Parts 23, 25,27 and 29) be evaluated to determine if any additional parameters mustbe recorded on the flight recorder due to any unique features or operationalcharacteristics.(9) Require that each newly manufactured airplane (Parts 23 and 25) andeach new CVR installation provide for uninterrupted recording from theboom or mask microphones and headphones of each flight crew position andfrom an area microphone and that the recordings be made on dedicated channelsof the CVR.(10) Require the use of boom microphones by all flight crewmembers operatingunder Parts 121 or 135 and below 18,000 ft. on aircraft equipped to recordthe uninterrupted audio signals.(11) Issue a technical standard order (TSO) for solid state flight recordersspecifying all required criteria not covered by TSO-C-51A.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Flight Recorder Requirements, 14 CFR Part 121The NTSB considered the 14 CFR Part 121 rule changes [52 FR 9622; March25, 1987] eliminating the foil-type flight recorders a step forward, butit is still concerned with the adequacy of the minimum standards set forthin 14 CFR Part 121, Appendix B, which were not affected by those rule changes.The accident investigation experience acquired by the NTSB during the last17 years has permitted it to identify the usefulness of the required parametersand the potential significance of parameters that are not currently required.The NTSB has concluded that there is an urgent need to update the mandatoryparameter list and to define new parameters, improved accuracies, ranges,and sampling intervals. (See June 19, 1987, safety recommendation letter.)The international aviation community has also become aware of the needfor improved flight recorder standards as exemplified by ICAO's adoptionof new flight recorder standards that recommend a 32 parameter flight recordersystem. These 32 parameters and associated accuracies and recording intervalsare consistent with those recommended by the NTSB. In addition, the EuropeanOrganization for Civil Aviation Electronics (EUROCAE) was recently taskedto develop a minimum operational performance requirement (MOPR) which definesthe minimum operational performance standards, guidance material for installation,parameters recorded, data compression, data retrieval, and crash survivabilitytesting for the next generation of recorders.The above concerns indicate that technological changes have had a significanteffect on the information needed to properly analyze an accident or incident.The current lists of flight recorder parameters, whether required by theFAA or recommended by the NTSB or ICAO, have always presented a compromisebetween desired parameters and economically feasible parameters. However,new electronic display systems (i.e., ``glass cockpits''), that includean ARINC 429 data bus provide some relief from economic constraints and,at the same time, introduce additional investigative requirements. TheARINC 429 digital data bus, which is on the Boeing 757, 767, and 747-400,as well as the Airbus A300-600, A310, and 320, can provide a wealth ofadditional data. In fact, the amount of data is so extensive that the onlyconstraint to the flight recorder system appears to be the recording capacityof the flight recorder. On the other hand, such new electronic displayspose new investigative challenges due to their operational and physicalcharacteristics. For example, the video display units will supply littleuseful information in the post-accident environment. With the expandingrole of technology in the operation of modern aircraft, a thorough knowledgeof the interaction of man and machine in accident investigations has becomeeven more critical. The introduction of the Airbus A320 with its fly-by-wiretechnology will present new challenges in accident investigation that willrequire the recording of information of a quantity and quality that goesfar beyond the current minimum standards. The FAA agrees with the NTSBthat there is a definite need for additional flight recorder parameters;that the core requirements be increased to include those recommended bythe NTSB and ICAO; and that the minimum parameter list for a particularmake and model aircraft be based on any unique design or operational capabilitydefined at the time of type certification.<T3>Commuter Category/General Aviation Flight Recorder Requirements, 14CFR Parts 91 and 135.</T3> According to the 1986 Annual Report of the RegionalAirline Association, the number of passengers enplaned by commuter aircarrier operations between 1981 and 1986 grew by 84 percent and is expectedto grow at an annual rate of 8.3 percent during the next decade. This growthhas resulted in the acquisition of newly manufactured aircraft designedspecifically for the commuter market. The maximum takeoff weight of mostof these new airplanes is in excess of 12,500 pounds, but since a significantnumber of them carry less than 30 passengers and have payloads of 7,500pounds or less, they presently may be operated without flight recordersunder Part 135. The NTSB is concerned by the substantial growth trendsof the commuter air carrier fleet and the lack of flight recorder and,until recently, CVR requirements.These technological and operational changes in the commuter air carrierindustry are comparable to those faced by the certificated air carrierindustry some years ago when wide-bodied jets were introduced. At thattime, the existing flight recorder requirements were considered inadequate,and a new set of standards was developed.A closer examination of the ``commuter category'' concept is necessaryto understand more fully the impact of industry growth and developmenton the need for CVRs in this category. The NTSB has stated that the January15, 1987, change to 14 CFR Part 23, that defines the ``commuter category''for type and airworthiness certification, is consistent with a logicaldivision point for the complexity and type of recorder required. As definedin Part 23, ``communter category'' airplanes are those having a seatingconfiguration, excluding the pilot seats, of 19 or less, and having a maximumcertificated takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds or less. An examination (addressedin the 1986 Annual report of the Regional Airline Association) of the commuterair carrier fleet indicates that only three airplane models have a seatingcapacity of from 20 to 30 passengers, and a maximum payload of 7,500 poundsor less. Two of the three airplanes, the Embraer EMB-120 and Shorts 330,have a seating capacity of 30 passengers. The other airplane, the CASA212, has a seating capacity of 26 passengers. The FAA agrees with the NTSBthat these airplanes are of sufficient size and complexity to warrant theinstallation of flight recorders that meet the requirements of 14 CFR Part121. At least two models, the EMB-120 and Shorts 330, are being operatedin Europe with complete flight recorder and CVR systems.Therefore, the airplanes that fall into the designation of commuter category,19 or less passengers and 19,000 pounds or less, are distinctly differentfrom their larger Part 135 counterparts. The NTSB believes that a morelogical division for those airplanes requiring compliance with 14 CFR Part121 flight recorder rules would be 20 passengers or more. This would bemore consistent with the current division that exists within the commuterfleet. It would also align those few airplane models of larger capacitywith the intent of the 14 CFR Part 121 recorder rules.As previously discussed, the technological economical feasibility of aflight recorder for the commuter category aircraft (19 passengers or less)is no longer in question. In fact, one recorder manufacturer has developeda recorder for the general aviation market that meets the technical standardsset forth in the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., document, ``MinimumPerformance Standards, General Aviation Flight Recorder'' (SAE 8039). Inaddition, the U.S. Army has just embarked on a prototype program to install200 flight recorders in its UH-64 Blackhawk helicopters. These recordersare a standard off-the-shelf version of a digital data recorder currentlyin use by a number of U.S. and foreign air carriers. This prototype programis a prelude to a much larger program which specifies that solid-stateflight data recorders (SFDRs) be installed on the U.S. Army's entire fleetof aircraft. Also, the U.S. Air Force is currently flying F-16 and B1 airplanesequipped with solid state flight recorders. In addition, a solid-stateversion of the 25-hour air carrier flight recorder has been proposed byone recorder manufacturer and is under development by others. Consequently,it is considered that small lightweight recorders can be retrofitted intogeneral aviation/commuter category aircraft with systems similar to thosegenerally found in the commuter air carrier fleet.Recent investigations of commuter airplane accidents continue to emphasizethe need for CVRs and flight recorders. On December 6, 1984, a ProvincetownBoston Air (PBA) Embracer EMB-110 crashed shortly after taking off fromJacksonville, Florida. Although the evidence of an in-flight structuralfailure was obvious, the reason for the failure was not. In fact, the investigatorshad so few clues with which to work that Emergency Airworthiness Directive85-01-51 was issued on January 10, 1985, which essentially grounded theU.S. EMB-110 fleet until a inspection of remaining airplanes could be completed.The investigation continued for 18 months. In addition, the degree of certaintyas to why the accident occurred would have been significantly more positivehad CVR and flight recorder information been available.During a 7-month period from August 25, 1985, to March 13, 1986, the commuterair carrier industry suffered a number of fatal accidents in which thesubsequent investigations ``revealed'' a lack of information pertinentto the causes. (For more detailed information, read Aircraft Accident Report-``BarHarbor Airlines, Flight 1808, Beech B-99, N300WP, Auburn Lewiston Airport,Maine, August 25, 1985'' [NTSB/AAR-86-07], Aircraft Accident Report-``HensonAirlines Flight 1517, Beech B-99, N339HA, Shenandoah Valley Airport, Grottoes,Virginia, September 23, 1985'' [NTSB/AAR-86-07], and Aircraft AccidentReport-``Simmons Airlines, Flight 1746, Embracer Bandeirante EMB-1101P1,N1356P, Near Alpena, Michigan, March 13, 1986'' [NTSB/MAR-87-02].)In all three accidents, the flightcrews were involved in precision instrumentapproaches in instrument meteorological conditions. The recorded air trafficcontrol (ATC) communications in all three instances gave no indicationthat the flightcrews were experiencing any mechanical or ILS navigationalproblems. The ensuing examinations of the airplane wreckage and navigationalaids did not disclose any problems that would have caused or would havecontributed to the flightcrew's wings level controlled crashes. Therefore,with the lack of any evidence to suggest mechanical malfunctions, the investigationsfocused on flightcrew performance.Unfortunately, the lack of flight recorder information severely limitedthe scope of the flightcrew performance investigations. As a result, theinvestigators were confined to areas such as interviews with fellow crewmembers,training records, FAA surveillance, cockpit standardization, and a numberof additional operational factors. Although the investigative efforts produceda number of significant safety recommendations based on sound evidenceof potentially hazardous conditions and practices, the specific flightcrewactions, inactions, environmental conditions, previously undetermined equipmentfailures or combinations thereof that caused the accidents could not bepositively identified. Furthermore, the lack of a definitive accident causediminished the effectiveness of the NTSB's ability to recommend safetyrecommendations. However, the NTSB indicates confidence that, had flightrecorder information been available, the specific deficiencies in flightcrewperformance or some heretofore unknown failure or malfunction would havebeen determined for these accidents.Two more recent incidents further exemplify the need and benefits of flightrecorders and CVRs. The first incident involved a 42-passenger turbopropairplane. (For more detailed information read, Aircraft Accident/IncidentSummary Investigation No. DCA-87-IA015.) On the same day, a second airplaneof the same type operated by the same operator had a similar but far lesssevere encounter. The FAA acted promptly to prohibit operations into forecastedicing conditions until the airworthiness of the airplane could be furtherevaluated. The flight recorder from both airplanes and the CVR from thefirst airplane were removed and analyzed. The recorded data clearly identifiedthe cause of the loss of control as operational rather than anything relatedto airworthiness and thus allowed for a prompt implementation of correctiveaction and the removal of the icing prohibition. This all took place withina matter of days.In stark contrast is the March 4, 1987, fatal accident in Detroit, Michigan,involving a 26-passenger CASA 212 that crashed inverted while on finalapproach to the airport. This type of airplane is not currently requiredto have a CVR or flight recorder installed. Without the CVR and flightrecorder information, the investigation was limited to witness statements,ground impact marks, badly damaged and burned wreckage, limited air trafficcontrol radar data, and flight test data. An FAA flight test team was dispatchedto Madrid, Spain, to conduct a flight test in the area of stall characteristics,stall warning, directional stability, and engine-out controllability. Theteam determined that the natural stall warning was inadequate. An NPRMwas issued on April 10 that would require the installation of an artificialstall warning system in the CASA-212. However, even with the informationobtained from this flight test program, a positive determination of factorsthat caused the accident may never be made. In the interim, however, thereare 29 CASA 212s in the United States and over 300 worldwide operatingwithout restriction and without a determination as to what caused the accidentor even what happened.On May 8, 1987, another CASA-212 in scheduled commuter operation crashedon the final approach to the airport in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. The airplanewas destroyed. There was no CVR or flight recorder aboard the airplane,and investigations were limited to information similar to that availablein the Detroit accident.Cockpit Voice Recorder ``Hot Mic,'' 14 CFR Parts 23, 25, 121, and 135The NTSB indicates that the performance of CVR installations where theaudio signal from the boom microphone of each flight crewmember is continuouslyrecorded on a dedicated channel, often referred to as a ``hot mic,'' tobe far superior to the standard cockpit area microphone (CAM). This conclusionwas reached after the NTSB investigated a number of accidents/incidentsinvolving both U.S. and foreign registered airplanes equipped with CVR``hot mics.'' In fact, the ``hot mic'' has proven to be a most significanttechnological improvement in CVRs. This level of improvement far surpassesany technological improvement that could be achieved by state-of-the artrecording or signal processing equipment.In contrast, the quality of the audio signal recorded by the standard CAMcan generally be described as poor because it requires considerable timeand effort to produce a transcript. Frequently, the tape contains unintelligibledialogue that is important to the determination of causal factors. Thehigh quality audio signal available from the ``hot mic'' should eliminatethis problem for the most part, and at the same time, provide additionalbenefits, as follows:(1) Positive crewmember identification,(2) Redundant multichannel recordings,(3) A potential for the evaluation of crewmember incapacitation by monitoringrespiration rates, and (4) Improved accuracy in determining which pilot was controlling the aircraft.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom (UK) has requiredCVR ``hot mic'' since 1974. The UK Accident Investigation Branch's nearly13 years of experience in analyzing CVR ``hot mic'' recording has promptedit to promote the adoption of standards by the international aviation community.As a result, both ICAO and EUROCAE have adopted CVR ``hot mic'' standards.In addition, the Board of Directors of the Air Line Pilots Associationvoted in May 1987 to adopt a resolution to promote the use of CVR ``hotmics.''Although the benefits of CVR ``hot mic'' are numerous, the economic penaltiesare slight. In fact, most if not all major airplane manufacturers are nowoffering CVR ``hot mics'' as standard equipment, and wiring an existingmicrophone jack to a CVR is a relatively easy task. Therefore, a CVR ``hotmic'' requirement would not pose an economic penalty either for operatorspurchasing new equipment or retrofitting a CVR on an existing aircraft.General Aviation, 14 CFR Part 91The general aviation (multiengine, turbine-powered aircraft) fleet is undergoinga technological evolution similar to, and in some respects greater than,that occurring in the air carrier and commuter fleets. The technologicaladvances in the general aviation fleet have been numerous and varied. Anindication of how pervasive the introduction of state-of-the-art technologyhas become was the November 1986 release by the General Aviation ManufacturersAssociation (GAMA) of three digital data bus standards for general aviationaircraft. As discussed earlier, these digital systems offer both an opportunityand a challenge to future accident/incident investigations. The opportunitystems from the relative ease by which vast amounts of significant informationcan be accessed and recorded. The challenge will come if this opportunityis not taken, because without ``crash-protected'' information (i.e., pre-impactinformation that usually is preserved after impact) future investigationswill have even less evidence than is currently available on conventionalaircraft from cockpit instruments, light bulbs, switch settings, etc.Accident experience continues to present evidence of the formidable cost,both in lives and property, of inadequate flight recorder information.The accident/incident histories of the Mitsubishi MU-2 and the Gates LearjetModels 24 and 25 airplanes have been well documented in previous SafetyBoard recommendations (see the June 19, 1987, NTSB safety recommendationletter) and need not be reiterated in detail. Briefly stated, however,both airplanes have a history of experiencing a sudden loss or reductionof control, which in many instances have resulted in uncontrolled, high-speedcollisions with the ground.In a recent MU-2 accident, shortly before the fatal uncontrolled groundcollision, the pilot radioed that the autopilot was pitching the airplanenose-down and that he could not control it. Because of this information,the NTSB has been able to focus its investigative efforts in this accident,and other MU-2 accidents, on specific components of the autopilot system.This was accomplished by the correlation of the service difficult reportsand accident/incident histories of the MU-2 and Learjet airplanes. Althoughthese investigative efforts appear to be providing some answers, the investigativeprocess is still too long and costly in terms of lives and property. Thetime taken to reach this point stems directly from the lack of informationof the type provided by modern recorders. If data similar to that proposedhad been available, a more timely resolution of the safety problems couldhave been made which might have prevented subsequent occurrences.A number of flight recorders have been installed voluntarily and have begunto yield valuable information. An indication of this was the recent NationalBusiness Aircraft Association (NBAA) policy that now encourages its membersto consider voluntary installation of CVRs. In stating this policy, theNBAA cited the value of CVR information in the recent investigation ofa collision between a corporate jet and a small plane.Expanded Flight Recorder Requirements for New Airplanes, 14 CFR Part 25Recent technological advancements as well as those envisioned for the futureraise serious questions about the adequacy of any fixed listing of requiredparameters for new airplanes. New airplanes may have unique design or operationalcharacteristics that affect their performance, such as unique handlingqualities and performance limitations; critical autopilot configurations;and, particularly, artificial intelligence dedicated to a monitoring functiondeemed critical to airplane operation. Such design features and operationalcharacteristics must be evaluated at the time of airplane certification.This would ensure that sufficient information will be recorded to helpdetermine airplane and crew performance.One can conclude that the aviation community, particularly the commuterairlines, cannot afford to identify its safety problems by an accumulationof accidents in which the cause cannot be determined in a timely and definitivemanner. The public expects and deserves a prompt and accurate determinationof cause, and it should never be subjected to a repeat of unresolved accidents.The NTSB believes that the CVR and flight recorder installations they recommendwould provide data of sufficient quality and quantity to determine specificsafety problems in a much more timely manner and with a much higher degreeof certainty.The FAA also recognized the benefits of recorders, as evidenced by NPRMNotice No. 85-1 ``Flight Recorders and Cockpit Voice Recorders,'' whichencouraged the voluntary installation of approved flight recorders andthe soon-to-be adopted Technical Standard Order (TSO) C-111, ``GeneralAviation Flight Recorders.'' Technology has progressed, and there are anumber of solid state fight recorders in operation on military aircraftwhich might be adapted for use in the commuter and general aviation fleets.A regulatory schedule that would require a prewire phase for newly manufacturedaircraft to precede the mandatory compliance date would ensure the mostcomprehensive coverage with the least retrofit cost.Rotorcraft Air Taxi Operations and Commercial Operators, 14 CFR Part 135NTSB recommendation A-87-79 proposes an amendment to Part 127, SubpartH, to require that all existing and newly manufactured rotorcraft, regardlessof the date of original type certificate, be equipped with one or moreapproved flight recorders.However, the FAA issued a final rule, SFAR 38-2 (50 FR 23944, June 7, 1985),as amended, which requires rotorcraft operations that were conducted underPart 121 or Part 127 to be conducted under Part 135. The amendment, ineffect, suspends Part 127 and 121.13 and 121.157(e), and requires all rotorcraftoperations to be conducted under Part 135. Therefore, those recommendedamendments to Part 127 will be included in the pertinent sections of Part135 and will address rotorcraft with a seating configuration of 20 or moreseats.Flight Recorder Requirements for Transport Category Aircraft, 14 CFR Part29Consistent with the NTSB safety recommendations, flight recorder requirementswould be added to mandate digital flight recorders on rotorcraft with 20or more passenger seats. The flight recorders would be capable of recordingthe parameters listed in proposed Appendix E of Part 135.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>This notice of proposed rulemaking would expand the cockpit voice recorder(CVR) and flight recorder requirements for various categories of aircraft,including airplanes and rotorcraft operated under Parts 91, 121, and 135.This rulemaking responds to a congressional mandate that the Departmentof Transportation initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider the useof CVRs and flight recorders on commuter aircraft and other aircraft, commensuratewith the recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The NTSB recommendations were listed in a recent letter to the Administratorwhich consolidated earlier NTSB recommendations that were not adopted asregulations in the final rule on cockpit voice and flight recorders issuedin March 1987 by the FAA. The NTSB letter also reflected developments inrecorder technology that had occurred since its earlier recommendations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Costs</ITAG>Compliance costs have been estimated for the various proposals containedin this notice. It is anticipated that the proposals, if adopted, wouldbecome effective in late 1988 or early 1989. Therefore, the 10-year periodof this analysis is from 1989 to 1998. All costs are expressed in 1987dollars. Discounted present values have been calculated using the 10 percentdiscount rate prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget for regulatoryactions.The major compliance cost categories that have been estimated for the variousproposals include equipment and installation costs (for both newly manufacturedand existing aircraft); maintenance costs; fuel consumption costs becauseof the additional aircraft weight; and miscellaneous costs resulting fromengineering, certification, support equipment, and administrative start-uprequirements. Cost information was obtained from various recorder manufacturers,and fleet forecast information was obtained from the FAA Forecasting Branchand several industry publications. Total compliance cost for these proposalsis estimated to be $222 million (discounted present value). Cost estimatesare summarized below in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Recorder: Total Costs byAircraft Type and Operating Rule</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[1989 through 1998]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Undiscounted</H1><H1>Discounted present value</H1>Part 91_Airplanes:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation </ITAG><D>$130,805,000 </D><D>$99,184,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Maintenance </ITAG><D>4,906,000 </D><D>2,914,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fuel consumption </ITAG><D>12,124,000 </D><D>7,212,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Certification, start up, and support equipment (10 percent of equipment/installation)</ITAG><D>13,080,000 </D><D>9,918,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>160,915,000 </D><D>119,228,000</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R>Part 91_Rotorcraft:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation </ITAG><D>18,802,000 </D><D>10,955,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Maintenance </ITAG><D>291,000 </D><D>151,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fuel consumption </ITAG><D>785,000 </D><D>410,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Certification, start up, and support equipment (10 percent of equipment/installation)</ITAG><D>1,880,000 </D><D>1,096,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>21,758,000 </D><D>12,612,000</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R>Part 135_Airplanes:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation </ITAG><D>53,633,000 </D><D>38,622,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Maintenance </ITAG><D>2,645,000 </D><D>1,539,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fuel consumption </ITAG><D>7,593,000 </D><D>4,480,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Certification, start up, and support equipment (10 percent of equipment/installation)</ITAG><D>5,363,000 </D><D>3,862,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>69,234,000 </D><D>48,503,000</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R>Part 135_Rotorcraft:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation </ITAG><D>32,609,000 </D><D>20,522,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Maintenance </ITAG><D>1,114,000 </D><D>626,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fuel consumption </ITAG><D>3,767,000 </D><D>2,099,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Certification, start up, and support equipment (10 percent of equipment/installation)</ITAG><D>3,261,000 </D><D>2,052,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>40,751,000 </D><D>25,299,000</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R>Part 121_Airplanes:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation (other cost categories are minimal) </ITAG><D>8,090,000 </D><D>4,708,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>8,090,000 </D><D>4,708,000</D>Part 125_Airlines:<ITAG tagnum="3">Equipment/Installation </ITAG><D>10,600,000 </D><D>9,651,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Maintenance </ITAG><D>1,080,000 </D><D>659,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fuel consumption </ITAG><D>1,170,000 </D><D>714,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Certification, start up, and support equipment (10 percent of equipment/installation)</ITAG><D>1,060,000 </D><D>965,000</D><R>n,s,s</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total </ITAG><D>13,910,000 </D><D>11,989,000</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="5">Total cost for all operating rules </ITAG><D>314,658,000 </D><D>222,339,000</D></ITAG>These costs are based on existing electro-mechanical digital recordingsystems. Solid state digital recording systems are in use in many militaryapplications, and corresponding commercial crash recorder applicationsare under development. Early projections from manufacturers indicate thatthese solid state recorders will cost approximately the same as their electro-mechanicalcounterparts. However, they do offer important advantages over older systems,such as reduced weight and space requirements.Installation of the relatively heavy electro-mechanical recorders on manyof the small aircraft that would be affected by these proposals could resultin diminished payload carrying capability and/or reduced range. Althoughthese costs have not been quantified in this analysis, they may be significant,especially for commuter aircraft. Further, there may be limited space availableto install these units on small aircraft. These limitations could resultin lost transportation capacity, and require tradeoffs with other equipmentthat operators might need or wish to install as a result of regulatoryor voluntary actions, such as traffic alert and collision avoidance systems(TCAS), ground proximity warning systems, weather radar, etc. Some manufacturersbelieve that potential reductions in volume and weight that may be achievedusing solid state technology could eliminate or substantially reduce theseproblems. Commenters are invited to submit their views on these issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">Benefits</ITAG>The benefits of flight recorders and CVRs cannot be measured in specificterms of numbers of lives saved or accidents prevented. Nevertheless, thesetools have provided invaluable information in determining the primary andcontributing causes of accidents in the past, and they have become an indispensablepart of aircraft accident investigation.It is universally recognized that accident investigation has played a primaryrole in increasing the safety of air transportation. Even so, accidentinvestigation itself is not credited with specific increases in safety.Instead, the credit is given to those changes to aircraft, flight procedures,airmen certification, etc., that are implemented to resolve safety deficienciesthat come to light as a result of accident investigations. Since the benefitsof improvements to CVRs and flight recorders are intangible, this benefitsanalysis will discuss qualitatively how flight recorders can contributeto improvements in aviation safety, but will not attempt to estimate safetybenefits quantitatively.Expanded parameter flight recorders have proven effective in the determinationsof aircraft structural, mechanical, and systems failures which have leddirectly to corrective actions, such as aircraft modifications or changesin operating procedures that will prevent future accidents. Expanded parameterrecorders are extremely useful in identifying the response of flight crewsto hazardous situations. Determinations can then be made whether or notthe crew's response was appropriate for the situation and consistent withthe training they had received, and whether additional or modified trainingand procedures would help prevent similar accidents in the future. Humanfactors analysis is one of the primary areas of study where flight recorderscan be extremely beneficial.The determination that an accident was <T3>not</T3> caused by an aircraft mechanical, structural, or systems problemcan also be quite beneficial because costly but unnecessary design analysesor modifications to an aircraft prompted by hypotheses rather than conclusiveevidence can be prevented. Similarly, use of expanded parameter flightrecorders could prevent temporary grounding of aircraft and avert economiclosses to passengers and operators alike.Another benefit resulting from the determination of accident cause throughexpanded parameter flight recorders is the ability to define more preciselythose operational problems that need to be addressed through research anddevelopment programs, such as windshear encounters. Analysis of windshearaccidents aided by expanded parameter flight recorders has resulted incombined government and industry efforts to develop ground-based and airbornewindshear detection systems, improved flight guidance systems, better crewtraining, and other corrective actions that are now being implemented toprevent future catastrophic accidents.New aircraft are now being developed with innovative design features suchas fly-by-wire technology, canards, extensive structural use of compositematerials, and tilt rotors. The result is that some aircraft are now enteringservice with these design features. Additional recorded information wouldaid significantly in the analysis of those accidents that will inevitablybe experienced by aircraft embodying these emerging technologies. The introductionof new technology raises a greater possibility that a particular aircrafttype will experience a series of accidents that are especially difficultto resolve as to cause. A fuller understanding of the factors contributingto these types of accidents will reduce the probability of their recurrence,as well as the possibility of aircraft being unnecessarily grounded.Experience has shown that existing recorders do not monitor some factorsthat may cause accidents, and that accident investigation of smaller aircarrier aircraft not currently equipped with recorders is greatly handicapped.The amendments proposed in this notice, if adopted, would increase theamount of information provided by recorders and significantly increaseaccident investigators' ability to identify modifications that will reducethe number of accidents involving commuter aircraft, high performance generalaviation airplanes and rotorcraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment</ITAG>These proposals would have little or no impact on trade for either U.S.firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign firms doing businessin the United States. The proposed amendments would affect only U.S. aircarriers and operators. Foreign air carriers are prohibited from operatingbetween points within the United States; therefore, they would not gainany competitive advantage over the domestic operations of U.S. carriers.In international operations, foreign air carriers are not expected to realizeany cost advantages over U.S. air carriers because many foreign countrieshave recorder requirements that are as stringent as those proposed in thisnotice. Further, general aviation operations conducted in the United Statesare not in any direct competition with foreign enterprises. For these reasons,the FAA does not expect that these proposals will result in any trade impact.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress toensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionatelyburdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to reviewrules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.''Any small entity that operates any aircraft in the categories that areincluded in the proposed amendments to Parts 91, 121, 125, and 135 wouldbe affected by this notice, if adopted. Some of these proposals could resultin ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number'' of small entityoperators and air carriers. Most manufacturers that certificate aircraftunder Parts 25 and 29 are not small entities and, therefore, are not subjectto the RFA.The following analysis explains the reasons for this determination concerningoperators and air carriers. In developing estimates of annualized net compliancecosts, uniform annualized costs for capital investments have been determinedby multiplying the amount of the investment by a capital recovery factorappropriate for the discount rate and period of the analysis. A capitalrecovery factor of .155, based upon a 10 percent discount rate over a 10-yearperiod, has been used in this analysis. Threshold cost values and smallentity size standards are those stated in FAA Order 2100.14A, <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance.</T3> Values have beenadjusted to 1987 dollars.The threshold values defining a significant economic impact for scheduledcarriers are $96,200 if the entire fleet has a seating capacity of over60 seats, and $53,800 for other scheduled carriers. The threshold valuefor an unscheduled operator is only $3,800. Furthermore, a small entityoperator of aircraft for hire is defined as one which owns nine or feweraircraft.The annualized cost for the least expensive requirement proposed in thisnotice, a CVR retrofit, is approximately $3,500 per aircraft. Therefore,an operator owning only one aircraft is very close to the $3,800 thresholdfor unscheduled operators, and any operator owning more than one aircraft(but less than ten) is well over the threshold. This would apply to virtuallyall small Part 135 operators affected by the proposal. A similar argumentcan be made for Part 125 operators owning only one aircraft because theywould be required to retrofit the far more expensive flight recorders aswell as CVRs. It is possible that a substantial number of other small entities(defined as one-third of the small entities affected by the particularproposal) could incur significant economic impacts, particularly scheduledPart 135 operators (commuters) if they obtain between six and nine newaircraft with 19 or fewer seats, or retrofit between four and nine aircraftwith 20 to 30 seats. Further, any small unscheduled Part 121 operator purchasingone or more new aircraft not equipped with an ARINC 429 data bus will exceedthe threshold for nonscheduled operators.Part 91 operators of aircraft affected by these proposals generally arenot small entities, however, and, therefore, would not be subject to theRFA.For these reasons, the FAA has determined that these proposals may havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of those small entitiesoperating under Parts 121, 125, and 135, and a regulatory flexibility analysisis required under the terms of the RFA. The regulatory flexibility analysisfor these operators follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>As required by section 603 of the RFA, the following analysis deals withthe proposed flight recorder requirements as they relate to small operators.A. Why Agency Action is TakenThis rulemaking is in response to congressional action and to several recommendationsmade by the NTSB. The reasons for agency action are detailed in the noticeand the regulatory evaluation.Briefly, the advantages of additional recorded information have been demonstratedby those aircraft so equipped, and it is desirable that more specific informationbe obtained following an accident involving additional categories of aircraftthan is possible under current regulations.B. Objectives of and Legal Basis for the RuleThe objective of these proposals is simply to make air transportation safer.The Federal Aviation Act explicitly states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrator (of the FAA) shall exercise and perform his powersand duties under this Act in such manner as will best tend to reduce oreliminate the possibility of, or recurrence of, accidents in air transportation,but shall not deem himself required to give preference to either air transportationor other air commerce in the administration and enforcement of this title.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Ref. Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Title VI_Safety Regulation ofCivil Aeronautics, section 601(b).)This objective has been discussed in the notice and the regulatory evaluation.The legal bases of these proposals are sections 313(a), 314(a), 601 through610, and 1102 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1354(a), 1421 (as amended by the Airport and Airway Safety and CapacityExpansion Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-223, December 30, 1987) 1422 through1430, and 1502); 49 U.S.C. 106(g) (Revised Pub. L. 97-449, January 12,1983); and the Continuing Resolution of December 22, 1987, Pub. L. 100-202.C. Description of Small Entities Affected by the ProposalsThe small entities are operators subject to Parts 121, 125, and 135 withnine or fewer aircraft in those categories stipulated in the NTSB letterand the proposals. This is covered in detail in the Regulatory FlexibilityDeterminations above.D. Compliance Requirements of the RuleThe proposals would require the installation of various types of cockpitvoice recorders and flight recorders in several categories of new and existingaircraft.E. Overlap of the Proposals With Other Federal RulesThere are no other Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict withthe proposed rules.F. Alternatives to the ProposalsNo alternatives to these proposals have been considered. The Secretaryof Transportation has been directed by Congress to initiate a rulemakingthat considers the recommendations of the NTSB to the FAA concerning theuse of cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders on commuter andother aircraft.The FAA intends to issue a final rule in this proceeding with respect tolarge and commuter air carrier aircraft no later than June 30, 1988. TheFAA has greater flexibility with respect to requirements for flight recordersin Part 91 aircraft than with respect to Part 135. If the record indicatesthat additional time is necessary for the commenters and the FAA to examinethe Part 91 issues, the agency may deal separately with Part 91 at thefinal rule stage. In the absence of any such indication, however, the FAAexpects to issue a final rule on Part 91 at the same time as it concludesthe proceeding on Parts 135 and 121.The FAA believes it is especially important that interested parties address,in their comments, the costs and benefits of flight recorders and cockpitvoice recorders in Part 91 operations. The FAA is particularly interestedin receiving comments from the NTSB and others who would participate inthe accident investigation about the benefits to be gained from recordersin aircraft operated under Part 91, and about whether there are any alternativesthat would provide essential information but still be less burdensome tothe owners and operators of these aircraft. What other regulatory optionsto NTSB's recommendations for Part 91 aircraft should be considered, basedon such factors as: newly manufactured versus existing aircraft, variousaircraft types and uses, and the extent to which new technology is incorporatedinto aircraft designs.Because the costs of this rule as it applies to Part 91 operations aresignificant, and may approach those of a major rule, the FAA invites commentersto provide estimates, and the bases for those estimates, on the following,with respect to aircraft types that would be affected by the proposals:1. The frequency of operation of existing aircraft in the following groups:6-9 passengers, 10-19 passengers, and 20-30 passengers; and2. The percentage of aircraft in each group with ``glass cockpits'' (i.e.,new electronic display system). Such data, if available, would be relevantto the cost per seat mile of CVR and FDR for different sizes of aircraft.In addition, the FAA has available a substantial amount of data with respectto:1. Acquisition costs of various flight recorder and cockpit voice recorderinstallations;2. Maintenance and operational costs of recorder installations;3. Projections of new aircraft entering service;4. Accident information, including fatalities, injuries, and severity ofproperty damage.This data will be placed in the docket for public inspection, along withall relevant assumptions and analyses performed by the FAA in formulatingits proposal.The benefits of this rule will mainly take the form of an increased understandingof the causes and contributing factors of crashes. Therefore, the FAA isalso interested in the following: To what extent has the availability ofCVR and/or FDR facilitated the success of accident investigations, as indicatedby the ability of the NTSB to determine the cause of, and factors contributingto, accidents? To what extent has NTSB's confidence in such a finding beenenhanced be the availability of CVR/FDR or reduced by the lack of it? Also,to the extent that data resulting from coverage under other parts may beapplicable to Part 91 aircraft, what are the additional benefits of thePart 91 proposals to operations conducted under Part 91 and other parts?<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.14 CFR Part 29 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.14 CFR Part 91 Air carriers, Aviation safety, Safety, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Pilots.14 CFR Part 121 Aviation safety, Safety, Air carriers, Aircraft, Aircraft pilots, Airplanes,Transportation, Common carriers.14 CFR Part 125 Aircraft, Airplanes, Airworthiness.14 CFR Part 135 Air carriers, Aviation safety, Safety, Air taxi, Aircraft, Airplanes, Rotorcraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administrationproposes to amend Parts 25, 29, 91, 121, 125, and 135 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 25_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES</ITAG>1.

(b) No person may operate a multiengine, turbine-powered airplane or rotorcrafthaving a passenger seating configuration, excluding any pilot seat, of10 to 19 seats, that is brought onto the U.S. register after (2 years afterthe effective date of this rule) unless it is equipped with one or moreapproved flight recorders that utilize a digital method of recording andstoring data, and a method of readily retrieving that data from the storagemedium. The parameters specified in Appendix B or C, as applicable, ofthis part must be recorded within the range, accuracy, resolution, andrecording intervals as specified. The recorder shall retain no less than8 hours of aircraft operation. (c) After (2 years after the effective date of this amendment) no personmay operate a multiengine, turbine-powered airplane having a passengerseating configuration, of 20 to 30 seats or a multiengine, turbine-poweredrotorcraft having a passenger seating configuration of 20 or more seatsunless it is equipped with one or more approved flight recorders that utilizea digital method of recording and storing data, and a method of readilyretrieving that data from the storage medium. The parameters in AppendixD or E of this part, as applicable, must be recorded within the range,accuracy, resolution, and recording intervals as specified.  (d) Whenever a flight recorder required by this section is installed, itmust be operated continuously from the instant the airplane begins thetakeoff roll or the rotorcraft begins the lift-off until the airplane hascompleted the landing roll or the rotorcraft has landed at its destination. (e) Except as provided in paragrpah (d) of this section, and except forrecorded data erased as authorized in this paragraph, each certificateholder shall keep the recorded data prescribed in paragraph (b) of thissection until the aircraft has been operating for at least 8 hours of theoperating time specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and each certificateholder shall keep the recorded data prescribed in paragrpah (c) of thissection until the aircraft has been operating for at least 25 hours ofthe operating time specified in paragraph (d) of this section. A totalof 1 hour of recorded data may be erased for the purpose of testing theflight recorder or the flight recorder system. Any erasure made in accordancewith this paragraph must be of the oldest recorded data accumulated atthe time of testing. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section,no record need be kept more than 60 days.  (f) In the event of an accident or occurrence that requires the immediatenotification of the National Transportation Safety Board under 49 CFR Part830 of its regulations and that results in termination of the flight, thecertificate holder shall remove the recording media from the helicopterand keep the recorded data required by paragraph (a) of this section forat least 60 days or for a longer period upon request of the Board or theAdministrator.  (g) Each flight recorder required by this section must be installed inaccordance with the requirements of andSection;25.1459 or 29.1459, as appropriate,of this chapter. The correlation required by andSection;25.1459 or 29.1459(c)as appropriate, of this chapter need be established only on one rotorcraftof a group of rotorcraft.  (1) That are of the same type;  (2) On which the flight recorder models and their installations are thesame; and  (3) On which there are no differences in the type design with respect tothe installation of the first pilot's instruments associated with the flightrecorder. The most recent instrument calibration, including the recordingmedium from which this calibration is derived, and the recorder correlationmust be retained by the certificate holder.  (h) Each flight recorder required by this section that records the dataspecified in paragraph (a) of this section must have an approved deviceto assist in locating that recorder under water.  4.
