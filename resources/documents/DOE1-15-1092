Before that thermodynamicargumentation was infrequent and nonequilibrium statistical physics wasabsent in the scattering theory for atomic nuclei. The theory of nuclearphysics was mainly written in terms of pure quantum states. The generalacceptance of concepts like friction and diffusion took some time becausethe textbook arguments for a statistical treatment seem to be not applicable.Neither is the number of partaking constituents very large nor is theidentification of the macroscopic variables evident, and the absenceof a heat bath did not allow to use conventional nonequilibrium physicswhere the response of the subsystem to small deviations from equilibriumis studied. Nevertheless, the highly incomplete experimental measurementsshowed clearly a dissipative behaviour in observables like energy, scatteringangle, mass and charge number. The collected data resemble the actionsobserved in Brownian movement but the fluctuations are much larger thanexpected from Einstein's relation between friction and diffusion. Asthe study of Brownian movement is the key to the understanding of alldissipative phenomena we use it to introduce the concepts which we thenmake use of in a specific dissipative model. We discuss the ''One-bodyDissipation model'' in its richness of phenomena and compare its predictionsto measured data. Special attention is paid to the nonequilibrium relationbetween friction (or mobility) and diffusion.</TEXT></DOC>
