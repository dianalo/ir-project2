Buttheir cheers were restrained.   ``I don't want to be a downer, but he's said things before ...he said he was going to let all the diplomats go,'' said PaulineGerard of New Harmony, Ind. ``Everything hinges on this ... and Idon't want to be crushed.''   Mrs. Gerard's pregnant sister got trapped in Kuwait when a visitwith in-laws collided with Iraq's invasion Aug. 2. Since that day,the family has been waiting for news like this. But when it finallycame the Gerards, like many of the hostages' families, reined intheir emotions.   ``We've been waiting for this almost a month now,'' Mrs. Gerardsaid. ``I don't want to get my hopes up too much because I don'twant to fall down too far if it doesn't work out.''   ``I'll believe it when I see them home in this state,'' saidMargaret Nuzum of Hutchinson, Kan. Her daughter, son-in-law and twoyoung children last got a call through from the U.S. Embassy inKuwait on Aug. 19. ``Until them I'm just praying.''   The Coming Home Committee's founder was more effusive. ``It'sjust an excellent sign,'' said Michael Saba, a Champaign, Ill.,businessman who escaped Iraq shortly after the invasion.   ``Whether the men are soon to follow or whether that's somethingthat has to be worked out isn't clear, but I'd say the signs aregood,'' he said. ``I think we're seeing some signs that say there'ssome ... interest in de-escalating the situation.''   Saddam's decree, broadcast by the Iraqi news agency, followed ameeting Tuesday with hostages in which he agreed to talk toPresident Bush and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher aboutending the Persian Gulf crisis.   But despite the conciliatory gestures, Baghdad hardened itsposition on Kuwait, declaring it a 19th province of Iraq. Thisstand is one that concerns Jo Ellen Buehler, whose sister ismarried to a Kuwaiti air force officer.   ``I'm going to stay excited and keep everyone's spirits as highas I can because that's all we have to clutch onto,'' Buehler saidfrom Memphis, Tenn. ``(But) I don't want to jump the gun.''   Saddam decreed that ``all women and children who are foreignersin Iraq are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel wheneverthey want starting tomorrow, including the families Iraq ishosting,'' the Iraqi News Agency said, in a report monitored inNicosia.   But Buehler said she's worried Saddam means only to free theestimated 500 Americans trapped in Iraq.   ``He didn't say anything about Kuwait,'' said Buehler, whosesister and three young nephews are among about 2,500 Americansstuck in the annexed country. ``What about Kuwait?''   Or, worse still, ``what if this is a way of gathering up andcarting them off to another place in a larger mass?''   Buehler, who hasn't heard from her sister since Aug. 3, was notalone in her trepidation. Families around the country said theywere trying to blot out thoughts of an elaborate, hope-crushingscheme.   ``You don't know what they're going to do,'' said EleanorGicking of Arlington, Tenn. ``They might even have a trap forthem.''   But, in her heart of hearts, Mrs. Gicking said, she can'tbelieve that. She choked up at hearing her baby grandson anddaughter, who is married to a Kuwaiti, could be freed Wednesday.   ``They're going to get out,'' she said, her voice strainingagainst tears. ``They have to get out.''</TEXT></DOC>
