ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane, his face red and his eyes filling with tears, lashed outat the prosecutor in the Oliver North trial Tuesday when asked abouta letter he wrote Congress on the day before he tried to commitsuicide.   The first openly emotional moment at the North trial, now in itssecond month, was triggered by chief prosecutor John Keker whosuggested to McFarlane that his Feb. 8, 1987, letter to Rep. LeeHamilton, D-Ind., was ``just complete nonsense.''   ``Well, Mr. Keker, if I had sat down in my state of mind the daybefore I tried to take my life, if I had tried to parse every lastdime that went to the Contras, it probably would have come outdifferent,'' McFarlane retorted.   In the letter, McFarlane told Hamilton, then chairman of theHouse Intelligence Committee, that a foreigner had offered in a May1984 meeting with him to contribute money to the Nicaraguan Contrasand that the amount eventually donated was $5 million or less.   McFarlane had known for two years that the offer came from thegovernment of Saudi Arabia through its ambassador and that thecountry donated $32 million to the Contras starting in 1984.   But McFarlane testified he had wanted to be sure the committeehad the full facts about the contribution. Speaking rapidly, he said:   ``You're quite right. If I had taken the time, it probably wouldhave come out differently. In my state of mind at the time, if I hadreally taken the time to tote it up, it would have toted up farmore.''   Glaring at Keker, he said, ``If that's your point, you're right,I'm dead wrong. I knew darn well it was something close to a milliondollars a month. ... I was acknowledging my participation in athird-country donation. And I wanted that on the record.''   When Keker pointed out that the letter claimed the money was fromthe foreigner's own wealth and ``not from any government'',McFarlane replied: ``That is a gloss, but that is what he (the Saudiambassador) told me.''   While Keker was asking questions, defense attorney BrendanSullivan often interposed objections. When it came Sullivan's turnto interrogate McFarlane, Keker turned the tables and the two argued.   ``Calm down, both of you,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell.   McFarlane's testimony, devoted mostly to aid given to the Contrasat a time when it was forbidden by U.S. law, also touched on therevelation that money from the sale of arms to Iran had beendiverted to the Contra cause.   Testifying about the events in late 1986 when details wereemerging, McFarlane said North told him on the night of Nov. 18 thatgovernment lawyers ``believed there might be a problem'' with ashipment of 18 U.S. Hawk antiaircraft missiles from Israel to Iran ayear earlier. He had gone to North's office because the aide askedfor his help in preparing a chronology for investigators and for astatement then-President Reagan was to deliver the next night at anews conference.   The Central Intelligence Agency had helped arrange the missileshipment and the prossible problem was ``whether or not theinvolvement of the CIA was appropriate ... or properly executed,''McFarlane said.   According to North, ``he and I hadn't learned of this shipmentuntil later on. ... He wasn't certain about it,'' McFarlane said,adding that at the time other American officials believed thematerial being shipped was oil-drilling equipment.   McFarlane had been told about the shipment in November 1985 whenhe was in Geneva but said that a year later ``I had no clearrecollection'' of it and thus used North's comments as the basis forthe chronology.   One of the accusations against North is that he obstructedCongress by saying in the final version of the chronology that noone in the U.S. government learned before January 1986 that Hawkmissiles had been shipped to Iran in November 1985.   McFarlane also testified that on a car ride to the White House onNov. 21, 1986, North said ``we're going to have a shredding party.''He agreed with Keker that North probably referred to hundreds ofdocuments, including memos spelling out North's involvement in theContra aid efforts.   McFarlane agreed under cross-examination by Sullivan that Northwrote only two paragraphs of a Sept. 5, 1985, letter to Hamilton _ aletter in connection with which North is accused of making falsestatements to Congress.   But he also said much of North's thinking _ as submitted toMcFarlane in a draft of the letter _ was incorporated in the finalversion.   The draft said that National Security Council staffers did notsolicit funds or other support for the Contras and didn't offertactical advice to the Contras.   McFarlane also testified that he didn't know whether Northprepared a subsequent letter to then-Rep. Michael Barnes for whichNorth also is accused of making false statements to Congress.   McFarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congressin connection with the letter to Barnes.   ``Did you know they are charging Ollie North'' in connection withthe Barnes letter? asked Sullivan.   ``No,'' responded McFarlane.   ``All you know is that you wrote it?''   ``Yes.''   Sullivan also brought out that North proposed letters to Congresssaying that executive privilege was being invoked and that the NSCwould not turn over documents that Barnes was requesting on North'sContra-related activities.   McFarlane said he had an NSC lawyer consult with the White Housecounsel's office, which rejected North's idea. Sullivan brought upthe matter to suggest that North wanted to refuse to respond toCongress rather than provide it with information that might be wrong.  </TEXT></DOC>
