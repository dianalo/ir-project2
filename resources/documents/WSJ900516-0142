The notice, which paves the way for a possible new basesaccord, came yesterday during the second day of talks inManila on the future of the six U.S. bases in thePhilippines: Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Station and foursmaller installations. Clark and Subic are Washington'sbiggest overseas military facilities.</LP><TEXT>   Both sides emphasized that the notice doesn't necessarilymean that the bases will leave the Philippines afterSeptember 1991. &quot;The serving of this notice of terminationdoesn't preclude a new agreement,&quot; said Stanley Schrager, aspokesman for the U.S. negotiating team. President CorazonAquino said during a news conference: &quot;We felt that since thebases talks have begun, this would be a good opportunity&quot; toserve notice.   Diplomats and other political analysts said the move wasexpected and noted that it served several purposes:fulfilling a domestic legal requirement, appeasingnationalist sentiment, and enabling the Philippine governmentto ensure that the current agreement doesn't extendindefinitely.   Manila's constitution stipulates that foreign bases aren'tallowed in the Philippines after September 1991 except undera new treaty. The present agreement requires a one-yeartermination notice, even after the 1991 expiration date.   The future of the bases looms as the Philippines's biggestforeign-policy decision and one with far-reaching politicalimplications. For those who support continued U.S. presence,the bases are essential to the country's prosperity. But formany of those opposed to a new agreement, removing the basesis a prerequisite for national sovereignty, and necessary forbreaking the links to a colonial past.   The bases issue is highly divisive for a country alreadyfragmented along social, economic and political lines. OnSunday, the eve of the talks, two U.S. airmen were shot deadoutside Clark Air Base. Yesterday, the communist New People'sArmy claimed responsibility and warned it might target otherAmericans.   While the notice may satisfy some Philippine domesticconsiderations, it doesn't necessarily resolve the legalcomplexities surrounding the date the bases can't any longerfunction under the current agreement. The U.S. continues tomaintain that unless both sides agree to either a new compactor an earlier end for the old agreement, the 1966 accordwould actually lapse in 1992. This assumes the 25-yearagreement plus one year for termination.   But few analysts believe negotiations will drag on untilthe disputed cutoff date. Mr. Schrager said preliminary talkscould end in one week, after which the two sides could agreeto negotiate a new treaty -- though that could take months.</TEXT></DOC>
