That is our raison d'etre. Our members holddegrees not only in library science but also in their fieldof specialization. When it comes to harvesting data, we arethe cream of the crop. And we're pretty good weeders too --weeding out &quot;irrelevant information.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A recent survey conducted in cooperation with themanagement-consulting firm Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane revealedthat nearly 90% of the senior-level managers in the 164companies surveyed felt their librarians were deliveringeffective service, and nearly 80% agreed that librarians wereresponding to changing needs of companies. None of therespondents saw a decrease in the impact of the library onbusiness. Hardly supportive of the statement that &quot;in-houselibraries might be slimmed or eliminated.&quot;   Perhaps the reason the ad executive mentioned in thearticle had such a long wait for information and subsequentlyturned to the information broker was that the firm's New Yorklibrary had closed years prior to the start of his search --a fact uncovered by one of our members minutes after she readthe article.
