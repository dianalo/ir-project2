Matas, a kidney transplantsurgeon at the University of Minnesota.   ``Now you're not penalizing anybody,'' said Dr. Robert Soberman,a nephrologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, where thestudy was conducted.   Matas reported at the annual meeting of the American Society ofTransplant Physicians that patients whose blood no longer testspositive for extreme sensitivity to donor organs enjoy just as muchsuccess with transplanted kidneys as anyone else.   In the past, such patients usually were turned down on the basisof their old sensitivity tests, even if more recent tests show achange, because doctors have been reluctant to waste precious donorkidneys on such patients.   About half of the 13,000 people awaiting kidney transplants inthe United States are considered particularly sensitive totransplants because of a previous transplant, pregnancy, bloodtransfusion or other circumstances that result in an unusuallylarge amount of cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream, said Dr.Lawrence G. Hunsicker, president of the American Society ofTransplant Physicians.   Until now, the best hope for sensitized patients was to receivea perfectly matched kidney with all six antigens, or geneticmarkers, identified. Such perfect matches are extremely rare,however.   But Matas said that in about a fourth of these sensitizedpatients, the level of cytotoxic antibodies drops on its own for noknown reason. His research concluded that these people do as wellwith a transplant as those who were never sensitized.   From 1983 to 1987, kidney transplants were done on 64 people atMontefiore Medical Center who had shown sensitivity to transplantsat one time but had negative sensitivity tests for at least sixmonths.   Matas and Soberman compared their transplant success rates withthose of 166 other kidney transplant patients at Montefiore, whoall had never tested positive for sensitivity.   The success rates were about the same. One year aftertransplantation, 79 percent of the 64 formerly sensitive patientshad a properly functioning kidney, as did 77 percent of the regularpatients. At three years, the success rates for both groups wasaround 70 percent.   The findings were similar regardless of whether it was apatient's first, second or even third transplanted kidney, Matassaid.   While such findings can give hope to many people who are forcedto exist on dialysis for years, awaiting a transplant, the shortageof donor organs remains a problem for all kidney patients, theexperts said.   `The worst part of (the new study) is that it only enlarges thepool of people to get kidneys,'' Soberman said.   Last year, 8,972 kidney transplants were performed in the UnitedStates, down slightly from than the year before, according to theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Early indications arethat even fewer kidneys are being offered for transplantation in1988.</TEXT></DOC>
