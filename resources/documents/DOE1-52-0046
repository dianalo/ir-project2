Three hundred and nine patients were staged as Ib,319 as II, 99 as III, and 56 as IV. The patients treated before and afterthe introduction of paraaortic lymph node irradiation (P-A I) were comparedwith respect to prognosis and side effects. Patients of all advancedstages treated during the era of P-A I had a significantly better prognosisthan those before that. The incidence of acute radiation complicationswas significantly higher in the group with extended P-A I than the groupwith irradiation confined to the intrapelvic region (p = 0.01). However,as for late complications, none of the patients treated with P-A I haddamage grade II or III, as compared to 2.5 % in the group with intrapelvicirradiation alone. The results indicate the benifit of P-A I in patientswith cervical cancer. (Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
