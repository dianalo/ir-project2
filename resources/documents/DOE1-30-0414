<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0414 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Department of Energy's human genome project is one of several majornew departmental initiatives that will strengthen the Nation's economicand technological competitiveness. It will provide the computational,engineering and biological capabilities needed to reduce the cost andaccelerate the analysis of DNA, the basic genetic material. Knowledgeof the entire human genetic map and the genomic sequence will allow investigatorsto more rapidly and effectively identify genes involved in genetic diseases,individual variabilities including radiation sensitivities, and physiologicalprocesses, as well as to make unprecedented inroads into evolutionaryrelationships. DOE-sponsored investigators in national laboratories,universities, and industry are constructing physical maps of human chromosomesmade up of linearly ordered fragments of DNA, developing new techniquesfor use in determining the chemical sequence of the genetic code, andimproving data acquisition, storage and analysis capabilities using thecomputer resources at Los Alamos. Development of these and other technologiesin the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, instrumentation, automationand computing will place the United States at the forefront of the biotechnologyof the 21st century. The workshop has been organized to bring togethermany of the leaders working in scientific disciplines that are eitherintegral parts of the genome project or that represent important ancillaryconsiderations. The aim is to provide a forum in which science writers,reporters and other interested individuals can gain a firsthand knowledgeabout the scope and direction of the human genome project and its supportivetechnologies.</TEXT></DOC>
