Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   Delaware's controversial anti-takeover legislation appears headed for approval by the state General Assembly and is expected to be signed by Gov. Michael Castle as early as next week.    The bill, if it becomes law, would bar hostile acquirers from merging with their targets for three years after an offer is launched, except under certain conditions. The Delaware House of Representatives unanimously passed the legislation Tuesday. The Senate is expected to approve it today.    Richard Templeton, Delaware's assistant secretary of state, predicted a Senate victory for the legislation by a &quot;pretty good&quot; margin.    Texas investor T. Boone Pickens Jr. has led an intensive lobbying effort against the bill. But state Rep. Charles Hebner, a sponsor of the statute, said Mr. Pickens's personal appearances, media advertisements and mass mailings &quot;had the opposite effect from what he intended. People didn't believe him.&quot;    Delaware's actions are being watched closely because 56% of Fortune 500 companies and almost half of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are incorporated in the state.    Proponents of the bill have said it's more moderate than laws in many other states and will discourage poorly financed hostile bids without significantly reducing the volume of mergers. Opponents have said the law would block takeovers that enhance corporate efficiency and benefit shareholders.    Some members of the Senate had proposed a weaker version of the bill that would have required a company's shareholders to approve the anti-takeover provisions. But that version got little support and isn't expected to resurface today.    The bill that's likely to be approved would bar a hostile acquirer of 15% or more of a company's voting stock from merging with the target for three years, unless the bidder meets one of two tests:   --It could purchase at least 85% of the target's stock in the same transaction in which it crossed the 15% threshold. Stock held by directors who are also officers and by certain employee stock plans wouldn't be included in determining whether the 85% level had been reached.    --Alternatively, if the acquirer gained control of the target's board but fell short of the 85% threshold, it could complete the merger without the three-year delay if it got the approval of two-thirds of the target's voting shares other than those shares held by the bidder.    The restrictions would apply to acquirers who accumulated a 15% stake in their targets after Dec. 23, 1987, Rep. Hebner said. </TEXT></DOC>
