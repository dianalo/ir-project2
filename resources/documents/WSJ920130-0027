It also said it would slash employmentby 25%, or 6,500 workers, and omit its dividend.   The company's departure from light structural steels usedin construction and machinery marks yet another retreat byBig Steel from a business it once dominated. It underscoresBethlehem's continuing move away from commodity-type steels-- which are now almost entirely dominated by more efficientminimills -- in favor of higher value flat-rolled steels.</LP><TEXT>   The move also may presage a broader retreat fromstructural steels altogether. Bethlehem, the nation'ssecond-ranked steelmaker, still must decide what to do withits structural and rail products. The fate of those productsis in doubt after joint venture talks with British Steelfailed last year. Bethlehem is the only major steelmaker thathasn't found a foreign partner.   And for cash-poor Bethlehem, which said it expects torecord another deficit this quarter, the fourth-quarterresults mark a return to the financial troubles the companyendured throughout the 1980s. Bethlehem didn't pay a dividendfor four years until 1989, when it resumed a 10-cent a sharequarterly payout. The steelmaker, which also will trim 1992capital expenditures to $400 million from $564 million,yesterday saw its debt placed on review &quot;with negativeimplications&quot; by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Bethlehem shares fell $2.25 to $13.75 in late New YorkStock Exchange trading.   With the steel industry mired in its worst slump in years,Bethlehem's prospects for a quick recovery look bleak. Steelis plentiful and prices reflect that. &quot;They're making theright move,&quot; says J. Clarence Morrison of PrudentialSecurities Inc. &quot;The question remains how quickly they canturn up with the economy.&quot;   Bethlehem's fourth-quarter loss, which translates to $8.47a share, includes the $575 million charge, mostly to exit thebar, rod and wire business and one of its rail productoperations. The two employ 3,000 workers. Beyond these cuts,as well as closures of two other facilities employing 440 andreductions associated with the sale of its coal business,Bethlehem will reduce its total work force by about 1,250 in1992 and 1993. In all, the company will trim its employmentby 6,500, from 26,500 to 20,000.   Even without the charge, Bethlehem's loss of $63 million(compared with a loss of $33 million a year ago) translatesinto about $21 a ton and was more severe than analysts hadexpected. The company blamed weaker pricing, higher costs anda lower proportion of high-end products.   The company isn't alone in its difficulties. Armco Inc.yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss of $241.5 million,or $2.75 a share, including $203.1 million for specialcharges and items.   Except for USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel unit, Bethlehem's majorAmerican rivals had already omitted their dividends. OnTuesday, U.S. Steel reported a $165 million loss, and InlandSteel Industries Inc., which had a loss of $275 million, saidit would trim 3,500 jobs.   While Bethlehem said it would seek buyers for the bar, rodand wire business, analysts said it is unlikely a buyer couldbe found. The company had offered to keep and modernize thebusiness if granted a new labor agreement by the UnitedSteelworkers union, but the two sides couldn't reach asettlement by the time talks ended last week.   Bethlehem reiterated its willingness to modernize itsstructural and rail products operations if it wins a morecompetitive agreement with the Steelworkers. Most analystsbelieve Bethlehem must go it alone now, with no clear partneror buyer in sight after the failure of the British Steeltalks. Ike Gittlen, president of the Steelworkers' Local 1688in Steelton, Pa., said he was optimistic that Bethlehem andthe union could reach a long-term agreement covering thecompany's structural and rail products. &quot;We can't keeplimping from one restructuring to the next,&quot; he said.   Also included in the charge are plans to sell Bethlehem'scoke-making facilities in Lackawanna, N.Y., which employ 400.It also will close its coke production in Sparrows Point,Md., which had been idling.   Bethlehem also said its charge for retiree health benefitsas required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board wouldreach $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion, but it didn't say when itwould be booked.   In the 1990 fourth quarter, Bethlehem had a loss of $516.8million, or $6.91 a share, including a restructuring chargeof $550 million. For all of 1991, Bethlehem had a loss of$767 million, or 10.41 a share, compared with a loss of$463.5 million, or $6.45 a share in 1990. Sales dropped 15%in the quarter, to $1.03 billion from $1.20 billion, and 12%in the year, to $4.32 billion from $4.90 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
