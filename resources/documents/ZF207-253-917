(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steve RosenthalandM;A scanner does not have to be built like a desktop photocopier to find favorwith many PC users.andP;  Hand-operated scanners, which users roll across a pagemanually to capture an image, are also popular.andM;While list prices that fall below $250 for some units are one majorattraction, convenience and flexibility also win plaudits from users of thesedevices.andM;''A big scanner can be a pain to use,'' said Stephen Saks, informationsystems director for the California Trucking Association, in West Sacramento.andO;''It sits out there; it takes as much room as a printer.andP;  It becomes anannoyance.''andM;Although his organization uses Hewlett-Packard Co.'s ScanJet when a full-pageimage isn't necessary, Saks prefers the hand-operated Handy Scan from DiamondFlower Electric Instrument Co. (USA).andM;As with their full-size desktop cousins, some hand-operated scanners aredesigned to capture graphic images, while others are meant for opticalcharacter recognition (OCR).andP;  Some units handle both, and almost all graphicsunits can be adapted for OCR with add-on character-recognition software.andM;''The products are very appropriate for selective data or informationcapture,'' said Jennifer Mitchell, senior industry analyst for theelectronic-publishing service at Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm inSan Jose, Calif.andM;''There are instances where you don't want to capture everything on thepage,'' she added.andP;  ''The hand-held design is good for selectivelyidentifying what you want and capturing that information.''andM;Consequently, hand scanners are used in data entry to read selected fieldsfrom larger documents.andP;  In desktop publishing, they are used to extract orduplicate small images, and they are also used in cataloguing or visualdatabases, where a small and quickly obtained picture is important.andM;The first generation of hand scanners included mostly pricey devices,optimized for OCR and based on custom hardware designs.andP;  Long before thearrival of the PC, hand scanners were used with point-of-sale terminals, andfor factory data collection and other applications where a human-readablealternative to bar-coding was desirable.andM;As with their desktop cousins, hand scanners use some combination of threebasic techniques to recognize letters.andP;  Matrix matching finds the best fitbetween the image of a character placed on a grid and a prestored collectionof character images.andM;Feature extraction looks for structural elements, such as the pattern ofcurves and straight lines.andP;  So-called intelligent character recognition addsmore sophisticated analysis and processing algorithms.andM;For data-entry use, matrix-matching scanners must be loaded with the outlinesof fonts that will be scanned.andP;  They generally are limited to eithermonospaced characters from typewriters or mainframe printouts, or to alimited number of proportionally spaced typeset or laser-printed typefaces.andO;Scanners that use the other methods usually accept a wider range ofcharacters.andM;Hand-operated scanners for graphics range in size from models with widths of2-1/2 inches, such as The Complete Hand Scanner from The Complete PC, to thefull-page-wide cryptically named SP-MD216AF from Mitsubishi ElectronicsAmerica Inc.andM;For many users, even the smaller widths are sufficient.andP;  ''Desktop publishingtends to use small images,'' explained Jeffrey Albertine, R and D programmanager for graphics-software publisher ZSoft Corp., in Marietta, Ga.andP;  Awidth of two inches is usually sufficient for a one-column graphic or photo,and is large enough to capture most company logos and special symbols.andP;  Inmany cases, he said, ''if you were scanning large pieces, you wouldn't beusing hand scanners.''andM;As with laser printers, many of the newer generation of units are builtaround standard engines made in Japan, with interfaces, software, systemintegration and support added by the product manufacturer.andP;  As a result,groups of scanners built on the same engine tend to share basiccharacteristics, and sometimes even basic drivers and control software.andM;Scanning ResolutionandM;Most of the scanners also feature a basic resolution of 200 dots per inch(dpi), set by the characteristics of the charge couple device (CCD) array,which is the active element that captures the image.andP;  However, some modelsallow scanning at lower resolutions so users can scan larger areas withoutrunning out of memory to store the image.andM;A few models supposedly have a 400 dpi mode, but so far that level has beenobtained by interpolating the basic 200 dpi image rather than by actuallyacquiring values at the higher density.andM;Despite certain similarities among models and whether vendors in this areamake or buy their basic engines, enough features exist to differentiate theproducts.andP;  Hand scanners built on the same engine, for example, may have verydifferent methods for connecting the adapter cards necessary to communicatewith the PC bus.andM;''We found that if we used an I/O [input/output] port, it was very simple,''said Bo Willyard, a product engineer with scanner maker Comar Systek Inc., inDallas.andP;  The interface board for his firm's Niscan hand-held scanner can beswitched to any of four I/O port addresses, making it unlikely that it willclash with any other devices in the user's system.andM;Direct memory access (DMA) connections, which are used by severalhand-scanner makers, are faster than an I/O-based interface.andP;  Comar Systekmight use one on future higher-speed products, said Willyard, but most basicPC models that frequently host machines for hand-operated scanners don't haveany more DMA channels available.andM;''If they have other devices, such as a network controller or an extra harddisk, you might not be able to use the scanner,'' he reported.andP;  ''With theIRQ [interrupt request line], you run into the same problems.andP;  Mice needinterrupts -- serial ports, printer ports, they all need interrupts.''andM;Further, he noted, a faster connection doesn't necessarily speed up thecapture process.andP;  ''You can only drain the CCD array at a certain speedanyway.andP;  The limiting factor is the speed at which the CCD stabilizes.''andM;Dropout color can also be an important difference, said Jin Wong, marketingdirector for Diamond Flower in West Sacramento.andP;  Most hand scanners, he said,use red LEDs and red-sensitive circuits, so they see red and white as thesame.andP;  That can be a problem when scanning color photos, he pointed out,because red is an important component of many flesh tones.andP;  Consequently, hisfirm offers a green-dropout scanner, which draws more power but does a betterjob on images containing red.andM;The software that comes with a scanner is particularly vital, according toAldric Lee, president of Computer Aided Technology Inc., in Dallas.andP;  Forgraphics, the purpose of scanning is usually to place an image into anotherprogram.andP;  It's important, he said, to make sure that the scanner has driversto use directly with the software, or that the scanner can export images intothe file formats.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
