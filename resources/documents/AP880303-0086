The 36-year-old legislator, Petrus Mbatha, was a member ofInkatha, a Zulu political organization that has been locked in thefierce feud in KwaZulu homeland with backers of militantanti-apartheid groups.   Mbatha lived near Camperdown on the fringe of the area aroundthe Natal province capital of Pietermaritzburg, where more than 400people have been killed in the feud since early last year.   Police said it was not known who killed Mbatha late Wednesday,but reported finding cartridges from Soviet-made AK-47 automaticrifles. Police regularly link these weapons to members andsupporters of the outlawed African National Congress, the mainguerrilla group fighting to end white-minority domination.   Inkatha's prinicpal rival in the Natal power struggle has beenthe United Democratic Front, South Africa's largest anti-apartheidcoalition.   Last week, the government banned the UDF from political activityand barred several of its senior leaders from further involvementwith the organization. Several of these leaders had been involvedin negotiations aimed at halting the Inkatha-UDF feud, and thegovernment's action was widely viewed as undermining the peaceprocess.   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of Inkatha and chief minister ofKwaZulu, contends UDF cooperates with the African National Congressin a campaign to seize control of black townships and oust blackmoderates who oppose violence.   UDF leaders have criticized Buthelezi for refusing to supportmilitant anti-apartheid strategies such as boycotts and sanctions.   This week, the government reinforced its security forces aroundPeitermaritzburg with 300 so-called ``instant constables'' _ blackpolicemen assigned to duty after relatively short training programs.   The Law and Order Ministry has declined to comment onallegations most of the new constables are Inkatha members.   Buthelezi describes Inkatha as a Zulu cultural organization,although it functions as KwaZulu's dominant political party.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
