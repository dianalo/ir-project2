(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A teen-ager reportedly inspired bythe recent Kuwaiti airliner hijacking took a semi-automatic rifleto school and held 70 students hostage before he was overpowered byclassmates.   Two shots were fired, police said, but no one was hurt duringthe ordeal, which lasted more than a half hour Tuesday at SanGabriel High School, 12 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.   Authorities said Jeff Lyne Cox, 18, was being held at theAlhambra Police Department today for investigation of assault witha deadly weapon and false imprisonment. Bail was set at $100,000and an arraignment was scheduled for Thursday, said policeDetective Dennis Hamby.   Ruben Ortega, identified as the youth who first tackled thegunman, said he saw his chance when the hostage-taker talked on thetelephone.   ``I could see people were getting close to him and he wasn'tdoing anything ...and he was busy talking on the phone,'' Ortegasaid. ``So I just went up to him and brought him down.''   Cox, a senior at the school, was enrolled in the class heldhostage, Hamby said.   ``He said he got the idea from the hijacking of the Kuwaitiairliner and from Stephen King's book `Rage,''' said senior ScottFrench, who said Cox was his friend. ``He told us to calm down, andhe said he wanted $1 million in cash tax free.''   Gunmen who seized a Kuwaiti airliner were allowed to go freelast week after releasing the hostages they held for more than twoweeks. Two hostages were killed during that incident.   Hamby said the gunman in Tuesday's incident ordered teacherJulie Rivera to leave the room and fired a shot into the air whenshe at first refused. Another shot was discharged when the studentstackled the gunman and disarmed him, the detective said.   ``It's the same kind of ammunition that we used in Vietnam,''said Lt. Robert Smith. ``It's just lucky it didn't hit somebody.''   Students said Cox entered the room saying, ``We have a problemhere,'' then threatened to kill his hostages, beginning with theones he did not know. They said he told them to barricade the doorswith desks and cabinets and to put their keys and wallets in atrash can, and demanded cigarettes and soft drinks.   At first they thought he was joking, said classmate Jason Burke,17.   ``He's a joking-type person and we didn't know if he was seriousor not at first,'' he said.   But that changed when the shot was fired. ``Then I was scaredlike everyone else,'' Burke said.   At one point school officials called the classroom to say theywould be late in delivering the soft drinks and cigarettes. Coxallegedly told them a 7-Eleven store was 10 minutes away, adding heplanned to start shooting students in 9 minutes and 40 seconds ifthe delivery was late.   But Burke said Cox told the students, ```I don't have anyintention of killing anyone. I don't think I can do it.'''   The crisis was not revealed to the school's 3,200 other studentsuntil after Cox's arrest, said school Principal Jack B. Mount.</TEXT></DOC>
