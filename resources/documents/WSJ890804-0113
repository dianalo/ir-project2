By 412 to 7, House members struck down special breaks for Chemical Banking Corp.; First Interstate Bancorp; Sears, Roebuck and Co.; Great Western Financial Corp.; Merrill Lynch and Co.; Paine Webber Group and others that had been larded into the huge savings and loan bailout bill.    Lightning is striking more and more in Congress these days. Lawmakers are voting against powerful, monied interests -- at least on high-profile issues ranging from the Sandamp;L crisis to Medicare reform.    An outbreak of statesmanship? Hardly. It's an outbreak of fear: Amid the recent Washington scandals, even the appearance of being in the pocket of rich contributors and powerful interests can be political poison. &quot;In the new climate, there is a countervailing power against special interests,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat. &quot;People are worried that their hometown newspapers and TV stations will start writing about how they're voting.&quot;    But the fundamental forces at work haven't changed. As long as the current campaign-finance system rewards incumbents who amass huge treasuries to frighten off challengers and allows corporate-sponsored political-action committees to give lawmakers as much as $2,000 for doing nothing more than showing up at a reception, special-interest lobbyists will be able to win friends and influence people in Congress.    &quot;When the spotlight of attention moves on, the special-interest groups and special-interest money does not,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause, the citizens lobby. &quot;That's when the improper and damaging impact of the present buddy system on Capitol Hill really comes into play.&quot;    Even as this wind of reform seems to be blowing across the Hill, business as usual can be found in some shielded corners. Meeting in closed sessions, for instance, the House Ways and Means Committee, whose members attract special-interest campaign money as if it were directed by some force of nature, has been busily searching for ways to continue a wide range of expiring tax breaks for high-tech companies, real-estate developers and bond underwriters.    But, for now anyway, propriety is in and impropriety is out -- in reaction to public cynicism toward government that has been growing for some time.    In 1964, 64% of voters questioned by the University of Michigan's National Election Studies believed that government is &quot;run for the benefit of all,&quot; while only 29% said it is &quot;pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves.&quot;    Last year, 24 years and innumerable Washington scandals later, the same survey group found the proportion reversed: 63% believed America is run by a government of the few and for the few, while 31% thought it is run for the greater good.    Events this year are hardly likely to regenerate confidence: House Speaker James Wright resigned after being charged with a host of ethical violations, and now an influence-peddling scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development is unfolding.    In reaction, many in Congress are adopting pro-ethics stances that would make Caesar's wife look like a trollop. In June, about 200 House Democrats and aides were briefed by party lawyers on current do's and dont's. GOP Rep. John Duncan of Tennessee went so far as to report on his financial-disclosure report that his 19-year-old daughter earned $1,500 working part time for a Knoxville dress shop. &quot;I have no control over her money at all,&quot; he wrote, ascribing the notification to &quot;an abundance of caution.&quot; And to the chagrin of congressional staffers, there is even talk of banning them from accepting lunches and other favors from lobbyists.    The key to many stands against special interests is public scrutiny: The brighter the spotlight focused on an issue, the less likely are special interests to prevail. Money still talks, it seems, but few want to be seen paying attention.    &quot;What used to be clubby, behind-the-scenes has now begun to see the light of day, and it's become much more difficult to do,&quot; says Steven Stockmeyer, a Washington lobbyist and spokesman for the National Association of Business Political Action Committees.    As a result, even some time-honored, back room legislative traditions are under fierce attack. The Senate, for instance, just last week passed a measure that would bar recipients of federal grants, contracts or loans from using that money to pay people to lobby either Congress or the executive branch. The measure, which is supported by an unlikely coalition of House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, would also require the recipients to disclose the lobbyists and consultants they do hire.    Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who wrote the legislation, says he was responding to both the HUD scandal and news reports that Cassidy andamp; Associates, a well-connected Washington lobbying firm, has solicited university clients -- including one in his home state -- and won large federal grants for them from the appropriations committees. In a marvelous mix of metaphors, Sen. Byrd declares: &quot;I don't want our Appropriations Committee to look like a cesspool. . . . The system needs a shot of castor oil.&quot;    Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, has ended the practice of using indirect language to hide beneficiaries of special tax-law breaks -- in the Senate, at least. No longer will General Motors, for instance, be described as &quot;an automobile manufacturer that was incorporated in Delaware on Oct. 13, 1916.&quot; Henceforth, all such deals will have to be generic, and senators sponsoring them must list all those who would benefit.    &quot;It's a matter of fairness and equity,&quot; the Texas Democrat says. &quot;The fellow in the boondocks without an expensive Washington lawyer should have the same opportunity as the fellow with expensive counsel,&quot; adds Mr. Bentsen, who once set up a short-lived breakfast club for lobbyists making $10,000 campaign donations.    Bipartisan groups in both the House and Senate are working on revamping campaign-finance and personal-ethics laws. House Republican leaders are considering a plan to require that at least half of a candidate's contributions come from constituents, a move that would erode the influence of special-interest donations.    Even President Bush is finding it politically advantageous to call for elimination of campaign-donation committees. &quot;Today's special-interest political-action committees and their $160 million war chests overshadow the great parties of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln,&quot; he said in a speech.    Terror about being tainted is changing the way lawmakers deal with lobbyists. Sandamp;L lobbyists, accustomed to cozy relations with lawmakers that some blame for the current Sandamp;L crisis, are suffering from the current backlash. Despite surging contributions from industry-sponsored PACs and their trade associations to members of the House and Senate -- up 42% from the 1984 elections to $1.85 million in the 1987-88 election cycle -- lobbyists found most lawmakers skittish to their pleas on the pending $166 billion bailout bill.    Kenneth Guenther, a Washington bank lobbyist, recalls being told by one lawmaker: &quot;This is not the time for you guys to lobby us on this point or that point.&quot; Adds Mr. Butera, the lobbyist, accustomed to seeing the Sandamp;Ls get their way: &quot;I've never seen a bill like this one.&quot;    &quot;Business-as-usual created the problem,&quot; says Rep. Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who offered the motion to strip the bill of the special provisions. &quot;It shouldn't further the problem.&quot;    If the Sandamp;L lobby is having problems, the well-heeled American Medical Association is ready to have a coronary. The AMA shells out millions of dollars in political contributions in every election. The physicians' lobby makes lots of House calls, giving to 95% of all House members since 1983 and directing much of its largess to Ways and Means Committee members.    In a show of ingratitude, the panel recently infuriated the AMA by voting to limit total Medicare payments to doctors, a policy called &quot;expenditure targets.&quot; The top four Ways and Means recipients of the AMA's donations since 1983, and two others among the top 10, voted against the association's position.    The AMA's money may have hurt rather than helped it. &quot;A lot of people are concerned that you will appear bought, and there is a tendency to go the other way,&quot; Rep. Rod Chandler says. The Washington Republican, second among Ways and Means members in AMA contributions since 1983 with $22,352, nonetheless voted for the Medicare-payment limit. In addition, the AMA wounded itself with newspaper advertisements showing a glum-looking elderly woman under the headline: &quot;How Do You Tell Someone on Medicare She's an 'Expenditure Target'?&quot; The ad so outraged administration officials that they sent White House lobbyists with copies of it to campaign against the group's position.    Special interests have been through valleys before. Spurred on by muckraking indictments of social conditions and the crusading leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive era of the early 1900s, Congress enacted legislation regulating such powerful forces as the meat packers. That was followed by the rise in the power of business groups in the years leading up to the Depression. There also have been spasms of personal-ethics reforms in Congress -- followed by Abscam, Koreagate and the Wright affair.    The current press scrutiny of lawmakers' behavior will probably wane, and Congress could go back to its old ways. &quot;Most issues in Congress normally aren't carefully monitored,&quot; Common Cause's Mr. Wertheimer says. &quot;In those cases, the power and influence of special-interest groups is vastly increased.&quot;    Oddly enough, the new ethical environment could prove to be a boon for one special interest-lawyers. Armed with newspaper clippings detailing possible ethics violations by lawmakers, Arnold andamp; Porter, a high-powered Washington law firm, solicits corporate customers for &quot;political audits&quot; to &quot;ensure that our clients' Washington activities are fully and comfortably within the requirements of the law.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
