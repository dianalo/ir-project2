(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pre-dawn arrests of 57 people on poachingcharges came under sharp attack, with one official saying residentsof the economically depressed San Luis Valley were entrapped by thelure of fast money.   State and federal warrants cited more than 850 alleged wildlifeviolations involving bear, bobcat, elk, deer and bald and goldeneagles, among other animals.   About 275 game officials, aided by aircraft, made the arrestsearly Monday in the valley and the Taos, N.M., areas.   Gov. Roy Romer said he had been told in advance about the raid,but was unaware of the planned tactics, which triggered at least 30complaints from people who said they were unnecessarily harassed.   ``Obviously I am concerned about the feeling, the trauma in thatcommunity,'' Romer said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting in Denver. ``Ido not criticize the fact we have to enforce the law. I simply ...and I do not want to make judgments about how it was done. ... Isimply know that there was trauma that resulted from it.''   Costilla County Sheriff Pete Espinoza said wildlife agents kickedin doors, dragged people outside in their underwear at gunpoint andimproperly stopped and searched people.   ``People were crying, babies were crying,'' he said. ``They(wildlife officers) didn't care.''   Galen Buterbaugh, regional director of the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService in Denver, denied Espinoza's charges and said the sheriffand others were worried about retaliation.   Espinoza said he and his family have been threatened by peoplewho assumed he was involved in the operation. He said he sent two ofhis children out of town and a third child was wearing a bulletproofvest. His house was burned down two years ago after he angered someresidents by breaking up a disturbance at a party.   Buterbaugh said so many agents were needed to make the arrestsbecause the suspects had threatened federal officials.   The investigation targeted commercial poachers, who illegallyhunt and sell game, and used an undercover agent who posed as ataxidermist first in Fort Garland, 175 miles south of Denver, andlater in Costilla, N.M.   Officials said up to 100 could be arrested before the 2{-year-oldinvestigation ends.   Buterbaugh said the undercover agent did not encourage poachingand paid less than the going rate for carcasses. The area wastargeted because the agent happened to be there and because therewere reports of a huge market in illegally obtained wildlife,Buterbaugh said.   ``We always work to make sure that we do not create a market (forillegal wildlife),'' he said. ``The market there was very large.''   ``The operation was well-performed in a highly professional andhighly workmanlike fashion,'' U.S. Attorney Mike Norton said at anews conference in Lakewood, where wildlife officials displayeddozens of illegal trophies and carcasses that had been confiscated.   But the sheriff said the agent, known in San Luis as John Morgan,was known to hang out in bars and ``place orders with poachers.''   He said that encouraged poaching and entrapped residents. The SanLuis Valley chronically posts 20 percent unemployment. One of everythree people is on government aid.   ``For that part of the county that is unemployed, $500 or $600sounds real good to them. They're going to go for it,'' Espinozasaid.   Officials would not say how much the agent paid for carcasses.   ``Why did they bring 250 people with helicopters and guns andeverything else?'' Espinoza asked. ``We're not animals; we're humanbeings. I don't know what they were expecting _ a war or something?This isn't Nicaragua.''   San Luis town trustee Augustin Jaramillo said the board ``willpass a resolution Wednesday asking Governor Romer to investigate thetactics used in this so-called raid.''   The governor did not immediately respond to the request.</TEXT></DOC>
