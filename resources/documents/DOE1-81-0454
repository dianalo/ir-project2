Exercise lowered the threshold foradrenalin production during stress. Adrenalin increased more quicklyand decreased faster in exercised than in non-exercised fish. An exercisedfish is more like a wild fish than the typical hatchery product. Exercisemay also enhance disease resistance. There were some cases of a lowermortality rate, in this case from bacterial kidney disease, in exercisedfish than in controls. Vigorous fish are more alert and more active,as well as having increased swimming stamina. Conversion efficiency increases,although sometimes at the cost of slightly increased food consumption.In some cases exercised fish appear to be less concerned about theirneighbors, perhaps because they were too busy swimming to be aggressivewith the other fish around them.</TEXT></DOC>
