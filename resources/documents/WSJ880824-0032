Although neither company would comment on the talks, Farmers stock rose $2.50 a share to $69.75 on rumors that B.A.T would make a higher offer that the insurer might accept.    Separately, the chief attorney for the Kansas state insurance department said a hearing on B.A.T's application to acquire Farmers had been delayed until Friday. The hearing had been scheduled for today, but the companies requested a delay because of the continuing merger talks.    The joint request for a delay in the hearing was another indication that Farmers is softening its hard-line defense against B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services giant. The companies on Monday issued a statement that said negotiations were &quot;progressing satisfactorily.&quot;    B.A.T needs approval of regulators in nine states to acquire Farmers. Its bid already has been turned down by insurance regulators in three states, but analysts believe that if the transaction becomes friendly, the regulators will change their rulings upon a request from Farmers. </TEXT></DOC>
