Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl told the jury in North's trial thatthe lunchtime document sweep occurred on Nov. 22, 1986, the dayafter North had announced to Earl that it was ``time for Ollie tobe the scapegoat'' in the Iran arms initiative.   Earl said William Bradford Reynolds and John Richardson, twoaides to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, had come into theNational Security Council office that Saturday morning, the dayafter massive document destruction by North caused the officeshredder to break.   At North's request, Earl had turned over his own records on thesecret arms initiative to Iran, which included a document showinghow the Iranians had been overcharged for the weapons they hadpurchased.   Some of the overcharges were funneled to the Nicaraguan Contrarebels while much of the remainder wound up in private bankaccounts controlled by arms dealers Richard Secord and AlbertHakim, who are awaiting trial in the Iran-Contra affair.   During a morning of reviewing documents at North's office,Reynolds iscovered the diversion memo outlining a plan to channelproceeds from the Iran arms sale to the Contras. Evidence of adiversion raised the possibility that crimes had been committed.   North stepped off the elevator down the hall from his office asReynolds and Richardson left for lunch and the three men spokebriefly, Earl testified.   While Reynolds and Richardson were at lunch, North begancollecting documents, Earl testified. ``I believed that those weredocuments that should have been sabotaged'' the previous day ``butweren't,'' he said.   Earl said North then went outside through an alleyway and headedfor a shredder in the White House Situation Room, where nationalsecurity crises are monitored.   ``It was your understanding that those papers would never beenseen again?'' prosecutor David Zornow asked.   ``Yes, sir,'' Earl replied.   Meese and his aides had launched, with approval from PresidentReagan, a fact-finding inquiry into the Iran arms sales in anattempt to develop a complete account of what happened.   The prosecution closes out its case this week with testimonyfrom Meese and two of his ex-aides. They will testify about North'salleged lies in connection with the diversion of Iran arms salemoney to the Contras.   Meese, now with the Heritage Foundation, a conservativeWashington think tank, will testify about North's allegedstatements that the NSC wasn't involved in the diversion.   North is accused of falsely telling Meese that the Israelisdetermined how much would be diverted to the Contras and that Northhad advised a Contra leader to open bank accounts in Switzerland toreceive money from Israel. The alleged false statements were madeat a Nov. 23, 1986, meeting with Meese and his aides, includingCharles Cooper and John Richardson, who both are scheduled totestify.   Meese's weekend fact-finding mission in November 1986 thatuncovered the channeling of Iran arms sale money to the Contras wascriticized later as inadequate by congressional investigatingcommittees.   The inquiry started as an effort to gather information on thesecret Iran arms sales. During it, a Meese aide discovered a memoby North outlining a plan to divert money from the Iran weaponssales to the Contras. Two days later, Meese announced that therewould be a criminal investigation.   Meese said he never asked CIA Director William Casey about thediversion and waited two days to speak to North's superior,national security adviser John Poindexter.   When he did, Meese said he didn't ask Poindexter whether he hadtold the president about the diversion of Iran arms sale proceedsto the Contras.   After North admitted to Meese there had been a diversion, theNSC aide went back to his office and shredded documents until earlythe next morning.   Meese ``waited too long to seal North's offices'' and ``theselapses placed a cloud over the attorney general's investigation,''Congress concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
