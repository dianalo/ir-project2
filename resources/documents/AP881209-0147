But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk ifnecessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and thesatellite was successfully deployed high over the Soviet Union,Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology reported in its Dec. 12 issue.   The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers thesatellite's batteries.   The magazine, citing Defense Department sources, said deploymentof the $500 million Martin Marietta radar satellite took place onthe shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it waslaunched at 9:30 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 2.   After the astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to release thesatellite, they kept their spaceship close enough to watch thedeployment, and were able to visually confirm when it was fully opento its 150-foot span.   Had it not, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr.William M. Shepherd were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair orretrieve the satellite.   The magazine said Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson first maneuveredthe shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the Lacrosse, then toabout 5 miles away, then further at 5-mile increments.   These maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateurastronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by TedMolczan of Toronto, Canada, according to the magazine.   It said the astronomers observed close-formation flight betweenthe Atlantis and the Lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits. ByDec. 6, just before the shuttle returned to Earth, members of thegroup in Australia observed the Lacrosse about 180 miles fromAtlantis, the magazine said.   The mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight, andneither NASA nor the Air Force released any information about itspurpose. However it was widely reported _ even by the officialSoviet news agency Tass _ that the Lacrosse was being deployed toobserve Soviet and Eastern European military operations throughdarkness or cloud cover.   Such information would be valuable for verifying Soviet armscompliance. The satellite would also serve as a ``radar eye'' forthe new B-2 stealth bomber.</TEXT></DOC>
