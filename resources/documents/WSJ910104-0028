Here are answers to some basic questions about federal andprivate insurance programs for credit unions:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Question: Are private insurance funds for credit unions inother states in danger of failing the way the Rhode IslandShare andamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp. did?   Answer: None of the other private insurance funds haveexperienced the same type of big loss, allegedly stemmingfrom fraud, that drove the Rhode Island Fund to seek stateaid. However, the funds' ability to prevent such a big lossdepends largely on how rigorously the credit unions aresupervised and on the state regulations that govern theirinvestments. Credit unions that make commercial loans,especially commercial real estate loans, may be exposed togreater risks because of the currently depressed state of thereal estate markets, analysts say.                                                                                                          Q: How does the financial condition of the federalinsurance fund for credit union deposits, known as NationalCredit Union Share Insurance Fund, compare with the conditionof the federal deposit insurance funds for banks and thrifts?   A: The credit union fund is healthier, according toseveral financial analysts. The credit union fund is &quot;on muchsounder footing&quot; than the Bank Insurance Fund, says R. DanBrumbaugh, a San Francisco economist and consultant who hasstudied all the federal deposit insurance programs. &quot;Theapparent number of credit unions that could conceivably getinto trouble and impose losses on the insurance fund does notappear to be remotely close to the number of troubled banksand Sandamp;Ls,&quot; Mr. Brumbaugh says.                                                                                                          Q: Are depositors in federally insured credit unions atany greater risk than depositors in federally insured banksor thrifts?   A: Not as long as the amount on deposit remains under thelimit for deposit insurance, which is generally $100,000 perperson in each institution. (Depositors can get more than$100,000 worth of coverage by setting up a variety of jointand trust accounts. Depositors also can obtain more coverageby spreading their deposits among more than one institution.)                                                                                                          Q: How can depositors in privately insured credit unionsevaluate the safety of their deposits?   A: Some analysts warn depositors against trying toevaluate the health of any financial institution. Bert Ely,an Alexandria, Va., consultant, says such an evaluation islike &quot;trying to do surgery on yourself.&quot; But depositorscertainly can find out whether their credit union is insuredby the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, which is afederal agency, or by one of the private insurance funds.                                                                                                          Q: What other questions should a depositor ask about acredit union?   A: Depositors should ask how much capital or net worth thecredit union has, figured under generally accepted accountingprinciples, and what its operating income was for the mostrecent full year, Mr. Brumbaugh says. &quot;You want both numbersto be positive,&quot; Mr. Brumbaugh says. Capital or net worth isthe amount by which an institution's assets exceed itsliabilities, and it serves as a cushion to absorb losses onloans or other investments.   Depositors might also ask how their credit union's assetsare divided among various types of loans or investments.Credit unions generally have large amounts of personal loans,car loans and home loans. A high percentage of commercialloans or commercial real estate loans could indicate that thecredit union management has taken greater than average risksin lending, analysts say.                                                                                                          Q: What are the risks of depositing money in a privatelyinsured credit union instead of a federally insured creditunion, bank or thrift?   A: The depositor faces a greater risk of losing some moneyif both the credit union and its private insurer fail,analysts say. In addition, depositors in privately insuredinstitutions face a greater risk that their funds may befrozen for some time if the private insurer fails, ashappened in Rhode Island, Ohio and Maryland. &quot;In thefederally insured institutions, the full faith and credit ofthe U.S. government stands behind the insured shares{deposits} and therefore there is zero risk of loss to thedepositor,&quot; Mr. Brumbaugh says. &quot;There is no full faith andcredit of the government behind a privately insured creditunion and losses can occur,&quot; he adds.                                                                                                          Q: What are the benefits of depositing money in aprivately insured credit union?   A: Many privately insured credit unions pay higher rateson deposits than federally insured institutions. In addition,at least one private insurance fund, the Florida Credit UnionGuaranty Corp., offers coverage of $250,000 per person.   Q: Are U.S. taxpayers going to be asked to bail out thefederal credit union insurance fund?   A: That appears highly unlikely, analysts say. The creditunion insurance fund is better-capitalized than the bankinsurance fund, and credit unions generally have made loansthat are less risky than the commercial real estate loansthat helped sink many thrifts and banks. Though losses onconsumer loans are likely to increase during the currentrecession, analysts don't think the losses will be enough toendanger the fund. &quot;I think that the probability of ataxpayer bailout of the credit union fund is zero unless thisis one of the worst recessions in the history of thecountry,&quot; Mr. Brumbaugh says.</TEXT></DOC>
