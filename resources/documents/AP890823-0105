The old town now is putting that name on a sign.   Mickey Spillane, the best-selling detective story writer whocreated the Mike Hammer novels, had a street named in his honorTuesday by the City Council.   Spillane, 71, was born in the New York City borough of Brooklynand now lives in South Carolina, but spent most of his boyhood inElizabeth.   Walter Milos, a classmate from Theodore Roosevelt Junior HighSchool's class of 1932, remembers Spillane as a sharp dresser andgood student.   ``I was his bodyguard,'' Milos said. ``He was picked on becausehe was small.''   Spillane initially downplayed the proposal to rename part ofSouth Broad Street to Mickey Spillane Way.   ``I don't believe in self-adulation,'' he said. ``Streets shouldbe named after birds or numbers or something.''</TEXT><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, wearing a pony tail and anearring, and daughter Lee, sporting purple hair, appear in a newOldsmobile advertisement the carmaker hopes will attract youngerbuyers.

Military officials said the new victims were all killed inviolence stemming from the country's radical Sinhalese backlash. Theradicals are fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government, which theyaccuse of making too many concessions to ethnic Tamil militants.   Premadasa said he had sent new proposals to New Delhi for thespeedy withdrawal of the 40,000 Indian soldiers in northeastern SriLanka.   ``I have sought specifically to ensure that our country'ssovereignty is recognized, safeguarded and maintained while thewithdrawal of the Indian peacekeeping force proceeds on anaccelerated basis,'' he said.   ``This will ensure the realization of our objective of safety andsecurity for all and an early restoration of peace and normalcy,''he said.   However, the statement gave no details of the new proposals.   Indian troops were deployed in Sri Lanka's Tamil-majority northand east to enforce a 1987 peace accord that gave Tamil rebelslimited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. However, theIndian troops later began fighting a rebel militia that renouncedthe peace plan.   Premadasa, who was elected to office in December with a mandateto negotiate an Indian withdrawal, had called for a complete pulloutof the soldiers by July 29.   The demand caused a diplomatic battle with New Delhi, which saida hasty withdrawal could allow violence to escalate on this islandoff its southern coast. However, both countries agreed to talks, andIndia withdrew about 2,000 soldiers.   India got involved in Sri Lanka's strife because of thesympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the country's population.   Militants Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983, claimingthey were being discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The war hasclaimed at least 11,000 lives, including about 4,000 people killedin the Sinhalese uprising.   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 57of those victims were killed or found dead on Tuesday and Wednesdayin scattered violence across the Sinhalese south and center of theisland.   The victims included 18 policemen and soldiers, eight suspectedradicals, seven civilians killed in militant attacks, and 24 bodiesfound with gunshot wounds, they said.   Among them were six government soldiers killed when Sinhalesemilitants ambushed an army jeep in southern Sri Lanka, the officialssaid.   Opposition groups and human rights organizations have claimedthat bodies found in the Sinhalese heartland are those of suspectedradicals killed by security forces or pro-government vigilantegroups.   The government has denied the charges, but senior officialsprivately admit that members of the security forces have committedabuses in their efforts to halt the radicals' campaign ofassassination and terror.   On Tuesday, officials and independent sources said at least 61people had been killed since Sunday in the Sinhalese violence.</TEXT></DOC>
