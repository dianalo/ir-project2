Mr. Ozal said he was certain his party had maintained its parliamentary majority. &quot;There will be no coalition,&quot; he told reporters.    With 45% of the ballots counted, the Motherland Party had 36% of the vote, according to state radio and television, followed by the Social Democratic Populist Party, the main opposition group, with 24%, and the right-of-center True Path Party, with 20%. The four other parties, including a Moslem fundamentalist group, were all below the 10% needed to take seats in parliament.    Turnout among voters was high, in the most open election since the 1980 coup. Aside from a couple of minor skirmishes, voting at the nation's heavily guarded polling sites was calm and orderly, news agencies reported.    Turkey, which applied last April to join the European Community, is eager to brush up its tarnished democratic image.    The 60-year-old Mr. Ozal had campaigned on his record of political stability and economic liberalization since taking office in 1983's military-supervised elections.    &quot;It {polling} has been completely free. There has been no trouble. There has been no ballot-box stuffing as in the past,&quot; Dilek Ocal, a Social Democratic official election observer, said in Ankara.    President Kenan Evren, who as a general led the 1980 coup, told reporters after voting in Ankara: &quot;Let it be beneficial to the country.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
