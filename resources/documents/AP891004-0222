The announcement was made in a Nicaraguan government statementat the end of a 24-hour visit by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze. The Soviet official told reporters it amounted to ajoint statement.   The communique said the suspension ``is a contribution Nicaraguaand the Soviet Union are making toward a total solution to theconflict in the region and a decided support of the CentralAmerican presidential agreements.''   President Daniel Ortega and the presidents of four other CentralAmerican countries signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling fordemobilizing the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in bordercamps in Honduras.   In exchange, the leftist Sandinista government agreed to makedemocratic reforms, including allowing free campaigning by theopposition for elections advanced to February 1990.   The temporary halt to weapons shipments ``opens greatopportunities,'' Shevardnadze said. He said a total and permanentsuspension in weapons shipments would have to be ``reciprocated''by the United States.   However, he said the region also needs a way of setting limitson combat forces in the Central American countries.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President Bush in Maythat the Soviet Union had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaraguaat the end of 1988.   Soviet aid totaled $11.2 billion from 1980 to 1988, half of itin military assistance. Though it says it has cut off supplies ofweapons, the Soviet Union has still sent Ortega's government $500million in various forms of military aid this year.   The United States has supported the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,who have fought to overthrow the Sandinistas. However, it haltedweapons shipments to them in February 1988 while continuing suchaid as uniforms, food, vehicles and other supplies.   However, the Sandinistas want the United States to cut off allaid to the rebels.   Washington also provides military and economic aid to theSalvadoran government in its 10-year-old war against a leftistinsurgency.   On the battlefront, Contra rebels attacked a military patrol inwestern Nicaragua on Wednesday, killing six soldiers and woundingsix, the Defense Ministry said.   In a news release, the ministry said the attack occurred nearthe village of Puerto de Paris, 110 miles west of Managua. It gaveno details of the fighting.   The government radio, the Voice of Nicaragua, called the attack``cowardly and treacherous,'' noting that the government has calleda unilateral cease-fire in an effort to end the war.   Also Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said two electionofficials were kidnapped by Contras near the town of San Nicolas,about 80 miles north of Managua. Its news release gave no details.</TEXT></DOC>
