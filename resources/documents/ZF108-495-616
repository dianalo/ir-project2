FancherandM;New Rochelle, New York The &quot;45-and-older&quot; crowd that seems to be souncomfortable with computers may simply be experiencing the effects ofculture shock-a disorientation that results when one's cultural patterns haveno meaning in the new culture.andP;  Perhaps as the cultural patterns around themhave changed, they have retreated back into their old, familiar lifestyles.andM;Tom KelleyandM;Memphis, Tennessee John C. Dvorak's computerphobia article about the45-and-older crowd brought back fond memories of conversations with my eldestson in the late '60s.andP;  He believed that the brain died at age 30.andM;Now, at the age of 42, as a practicing M.D.andP;  and the father of three sons,his outlook has undergone a remarkable transformation.andP;  I'll bet that Mr.andO;Dvorak will likewise grow into wisdom with the passage of years.andM;Richard HuddlestonandM;Houston, Texas What is this claptrap about computerphobia hovering around theover-45-crowd? Let's hear it for those computerphiles who have crossed thatdreaded age barrier and found that we did not suddenly grow yellow stripesdown the middle of our backs !andP;  I have been in the systems developmentbusiness for 22 years, having embarked on a career in that dreaded field,then called &quot;data processing,&quot; and I have met computerphobes of all ages !andO;What the world does not need is more stereotypes !andP;  Marianne K. MickelaandM;Stoughton, MassachusettsandM;INDEXING REVIEWSandM;As a current subscriber (for the past five years!), I'd like to ask a smallfavor.andP;  Do you print a cumulative index? I don't remember seeing one.andM;Walter GeorgeandM;San Francisco, California Your magazine is terrific, but I have a suggestion:When rewarding subscribers, stop sending diskettes full of cute utilitiesthat rarely get used.andP;  Instead, send something we really need: a simpledatabase that summarizes your product reviews.andM;I can't be your only reader who regularly hauls 20 pounds of PC Magazines outto the recycling bin for lack of space.andP;  I hate doing it, because the productreviews are invaluable.andM;Chris ButlerandM;Campell, CaliforniaandM;Both an index to PC Magazine and a database of reviews are available throughour on-line service, PC MagNet.andP;  A down-loadable index can be found in theUtilities section of PC Magnet, while an index of reviews is available underthe main menu.andP;  In addition, readers can access Computer Database Plus, whichoffers full text from 130 different publications.andP;  This is a surchargedatabase, costing $24 per hour plus hit charges in addition to the PC Magnetcost of $12.50 per hour.andM;PUTTING IN A GOOD WORDandM;I hope you give Microsoft Word for Windows another hearing soon.andP;  Your review(First Looks, PC Magazine, February 13,1990,) missed several highlights ofthe program.andP;  In noting that clippings from Excel spreadsheets can beimported as tables, you neglect the exciting use of tables within theprogram.andM;Another point is overlooked when you described the draft mode as &quot;ugly butfast.&quot; Many new Word for Windows users have told me they do not like to seethe Windows screen fonts during document creation.andP;  This is because a VGAdisplay appears fuzzy and slow to someone used to DOS character-basedapplications.andP;  The Draft View uses a single, clear screen font, and graphicimages are replaced by empty boxes.andP;  This lets users concentrate on writingand worry about viewing fonts and graphic images later.andM;David DeanandM;Contributing EditorandM;PC Publishing MagazineandM;New York, New YorkandM;JUNE 12,1990 PC MAGAZINEandM;EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYSandM;WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT LANS I just wanted to offer kudos to Pete Maclean forhis Lab Notes, &quot;Extending the Local Area Network to the Laptop Computer,&quot; andFrank Derfler for his Connectivity column in your March 13, 1990, issue.andO;Both articles were great.andM;We use a lot of this equipment at work, and I've always wondered how it allfit together and what else was possible.andP;  The half-hour I spent reading thosetwo columns was the most useful reading I've done in weeks.andM;Annette NapoliandM;Houston, TexasandM;WORDS FOR ZACHMANNandM;While William F. Zachmann's column of February 13th brings up someinteresting points, it fails to tell how a PC-based system will be able toreplace a mainframe with hundreds of users simultaneously accessing an OLTP(on-line transaction processing) application updating a large centraldatabase.andM;The needs of some corporations cannot be met by local PC networks withyesterday's database, or even last hour's database.andP;  These functions are, andwill be, best served by a custom application running on a mainframe.andM;What micros do offer, though, is a replacement for smaller systems,especially minicomputers.andM;Bruce GrembowskiandM;Los Gatos, California I wish to take issue with William F. Zachmann'scontinuous shilling for OS/2 since it is becoming obvious to even the mostcasual observer that the failing OS/2 is fundamentally and profoundly flawedto its core.andM;The most damaging OS/2 flaw is the bid to strike out (pun intended) in a newdirection: the failure to make OS/2 a compatible extension of DOS.andP;  Themasses are not going to trash their DOS applications for the sake of anoperating system-and that doesn't mean just the majors like spreadsheets,word processors, desktop publishing programs, and the like, but all thelittle games,shareware, utilities, and dinky COM and EXE files that make upthe environment.andM;Extending operating environments so that present applications will still runis a time-honored tradition in data processing, and it was pure pomposity onthe part of the Microsoft/IBM cabal to believe that they didn't have tofollow this tradition.andP;  They didn't have to do it like this; with softwareyou can do anything, and that includes extending DOS.andM;By the middle of the '90s, OS/2 will have achieved a status comparable toCP/M today, and its death will be unmourned.andM;Jeffrey FialaandM;Brookfield, illinoisandM;WHAT PRICE INTEGRATEDandM;SOFTWARE? I enjoyed your very thorough article on low-cost integratedsoftware (&quot;Integrated Software Gets it Together,&quot; PC Magazine, December 26,1989).andP;  However, I disagree with your judgment call on Integrated 7 Advanced.andM;You need to amplify the information about the market price of the testedsoftware.andP;  Integrated 7 Advanced, Microsoft Works, and PFS:First Choice allsell at discounted prices in the $90 to $100 range.andP;  Better WorkingEight-in-One discounts to about $40.andP;  At least six of the seven reviewedpackages are available for under $100.andP;  So calling Integrated 7 the mostexpensive of the group is somewhat moot.andM;Alan C. SmithandM;Apo, New YorkandM;UTILITY TO THE RESCUEandM;We finally used one of the utilities listed in PC Magazine  &quot;PCRemote,&quot;Utilities, January 16,1990), and it was exceptional !andP;  Last week a client,the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), had a problem with the FoxBASEdatabase files used to maintain individual and team season stats.andP;  Previouslywe would have either transferred files or sent the disks back to the vendorto check and repair the problem.andM;Instead I logged onto PC MagNet, downloaded PCRemote, transferred a copy tothe MISL, and used PCRemote to run the league's computer from our office justas if I were at its keyboard.andP;  Exactly as described, we were able to run ourclient's version of FoxBASE, edit the files, and within 30 minutes repairedthe problem.andM;Thank you for PCRemote, and keep up the good work.andM;James L. DaigleandM;PresidentandM;Sports Systems Services Inc.andM;New York, New YorkandM;A PLEA FOR SURGE PROTECTIONandM;Normally, I can rely on PC Magazine for good performance reviews on all majorbrands of computer equipment, components, and peripherals.andP;  Unfortunately, inthe two years of back issues I have sitting on my office shelves, I have beenunable to find a single review of power-conditioning equipment.andP;  Thisequipment is vital to the regular operation of PCs and peripherals, yet yourefuse to recognize its importance.andM;Having spent the last several weeks trying to deal with differentmanufacturers claiming that theirs is the only true surge-suppression device,uninterruptible power supply, or standby power supply, I could use some help.andO;I know it's boring.andP;  But it is not as boring as watching your $4,500 laserprinter sitting there unused because it was severely damaged due to inferiorpower-conditioning equipment.andM;Pete C. WilsonandM;Fort Wayne, IndianaandM;PC Magazine recognizes the importance of protecting your computer equipment,and we will be featuring an in-depth look at power conditioning equipment inone of the fall issues this year.andM;GUIs AND LITERACYandM;In response to the letter from John Boots (Letters, PC Magazine, February13,1990), GUIs are here to stay! The form that literacy is taking is changingwith the technologies that are prevailing in our society.andM;We are a nation that has been weaned on remote, baptized by Nintendo, andsoon to be confirmed by camcorders.andP;  As a remedial education specialist with15 years of teaching experience and an enthusiast for computer-basedinstruction, I applaud the use of GUIs as an innovation that enhances thelearning process.andM;Educational software packages that incorporate GUIs are encouraging ourstudents to learn through their generation's medium.andP;  Perhaps one so opposedto graphical user interfaces would prefer hieroglyphics, another form ofcommunication that also incorporates silicon-based icons.andM;Janice NazarewiczandM;Worcester, MassachusettsandM;LOTUS AND OS/2andM;We would be pleased if you would explain a statement made by Richard HaleShaw in the February 27, 1990 article, &quot;Excel for OS/2: A New Home for an OldFavorite.&quot;andM;In his article he states, &quot;We found that when we switched to its full-screensession under OS/2 1.2, 1-2-3  Release 3) consistently crashed.&quot; Thisstatement requires clarification.andM;Immediately prior to the release of OS/2 1.2 in September 1989, Lotus learnedof a change in the operating system code between versions 1.1 and 1.2 ofOS/2.andP;  Since 1-2-3 Release 3 had shipped prior to OS/2 1.2, this changerendered Release 3 display drivers incompatible with the new version, OS/21.2.andM;Lotus immediately offered its customers a solution to the problem byproviding an update to the Release 3 Display Drivers disk for OS/2 1.2.andP;  Thisdisk may be obtained, free of charge, by contacting Lotus Customer Service at(800) 345-1043.andM;Paul McNultyandM;Director of Marketing, 1-2-3 Release 3andM;Lotus Development Corp.andM;Cambridge, MassachusettsandM;PC Magazine tested Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 for the &quot;Exce/forOS/2&quot; article usingthe package Lotus shipped us in mid-October, 1989.andP;  It included neither anupdated version of the software on the disks nor an upgrade notification.andO;Nor were the support personnel we talked to able to answer why we had aproblem when we brought it to their attention.andP;  *andO;</TEXT></DOC>
