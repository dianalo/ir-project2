Introduction </ITAG>A. Test Rule Development Under TSCA The final rule is part of the overall implementation of section 4 of TSCA(Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq.,</T3> 15 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et seq</T3>.), which contains authority for EPA to require the developmentof data relevant to assessing the risk to health and environment posedby exposure to particular chemical substances or mixtures (chemicals).Under section 4(a) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical to developdata if the Administrator makes certain findings as described in TSCA undersection 4(a)(1)(A) or (B). Detailed discussions of the statutory section4 findings are provided in the EPA's first and second proposed test ruleswhich were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300). B. Regulatory History The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) recommended isopropanol with intentto designate for health effects testing consideration in its 19th Report,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 14, 1986 (51 FR 41417). The ITC designatedisopropanol for priority testing consideration in its 20th Report (May20, 1987, 52 FR 19020). The ITC recommended that isopropanol be testedfor chronic toxicity including oncogenicity, and for genotoxicity includingmutagenicity in mammalian systems and clastogenicity. Testing for developmentaland reproductive effects was deferred from consideration pending the outcomeof relevant studies that were being conducted in the United Kingdom bythe British Industrial and Biological Research Association (BIBRA). EPA responded to the ITC's recommendations for isopropanol by issuing aproposed rule (March 16, 1988, 53 FR 8638), which proposed that isopropanolbe tested for subchronic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmentaltoxicity, neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, oncogenicity,and pharmacokinetics. Consent order negotiations for isopropanol, attemptedprior to rulemaking, were abandoned when consensus could not be reachedbetween EPA and the Isopropanol Panel of the Chemical Manufacturers Association(CMA) on the requirements of a two-species oncogenicity bioassay. The proposed rule for isopropanol contained the discussions on the attemptedconsent order, chemical profile of isopropanol, section 4(a) findings,and the proposed test standards and reporting requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Public Comments </ITAG>EPA received written comments on the isopropanol proposed test rule fromthe Isopropanol Panel of CMA (the Panel), the Procter and Gamble Company(PGC), and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) on May 16, 1988(Refs. 1 through 3). The Panel members are: Arco Chemical Company, ExxonChemical Corporation, Shell Oil Company, and Union Carbide Corporation.A public meeting was also requested by the Panel and was held on June 1,1988. The Panel submitted supplemental written comments on July 21, 1988that reiterated the issues discussed at the public meeting (Ref. 4). Asummary of the comments received on the isopropanol proposed test ruleare stated in the following Units II. A. and B. along with EPA's responsesto the comments. A. Exposure Finding The Panel stated that it does not dispute EPA's finding that there is ormay be substantial exposure to isopropanol, although it does not acceptall aspects of EPA's characterization of exposure (Ref. 1). 1. <T3>Exposure during isopropanol manufacture.</T3> The Panel expressed concernthat EPA's proposed rule may have overstated worker exposure to isopropanolduring its manufacture. The Panel indicated that it had initiated a surveyof its four members, who produce all of the U.S. isopropanol at five manufacturingsites, to obtain data on potential and actual exposure during productionof isopropanol (Ref. 1). The survey results, submitted to EPA as part ofthe Panel's supplemental written comments, showed that there are 395 manufacturingemployees in the United States who are potentially exposed to isopropanol.The concentration of isopropanol to which employees are exposed rangedfrom 0.02 parts per million (ppm) to 6.41 ppm (Ref. 1). The worker exposure level to isopropanol of 50 mg/m3 (approximately 20ppm) during its manufacture, stated in the proposed rule, is the upperlimit of exposure derived from EPA analysis (Ref. 5). Although worker exposureto isopropanol from manufacturing operations is generally less than thisvalue, EPA believes that worker exposure from isopropanol manufacturingoperations is only a minor source of occupational exposure to isopropanol.Worker exposure from industrial use is a much greater source of occupationalexposure to isopropanol (Ref. 5). Therefore, the data on exposure to workersat manufacturing facilities are of only limited use, since exposure toworkers from processing and use of isopropanol, which contributes a fargreater proportion of the exposure upon which the substantial exposurefinding is based, was not considered by the Panel. 2. <T3>Inhalation exposure within the general population.</T3> The Panel suggestedthat isopropanol may be a naturally occurring constituent of milk, therefore,the Pellizarri mother's milk study (Ref. 6) should not be used as evidenceof exposure to isopropanol in the general population. The Panel also pointedout several serious flaws with this study. EPA agrees that there are flaws in the Pellizzari study and is not usingthe study to support the findings in the rule. B. Health Effects Testing Requirements The Panel agreed with EPA that additional health effects testing for isopropanolis warranted. Therefore, the Panel's comments are directed principallyat the scope and sequence of the required tests and the selection of appropriatemethodologies (Ref. 1). 1. <T3>Route of exposure.</T3> a. The Panel stated that, since inhalationis the principal route of exposure to isopropanol, inhalation should bethe preferred route of exposure for all of the major health effects studiesconducted, including reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, anddevelopmental neurotoxicity studies. The Panel envisioned no technicaldifficulties in conducting the required studies by inhalation. The Panelrecommended that exposure be through drinking water if EPA concludes inhalationis an inappropriate route for any of the major health effects studies.The Panel further stated that gavage administration is particularly inappropriatefor testing isopropanol because isopropanol demonstrates saturable metabolism.EPA concurs with the Panel that there are no major technical difficultieswith conducting developmental toxicity tests by the inhalation route. Thereare, however, technical difficulties with conducting both the reproductivetoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity tests by inhalation. In theselatter tests the animals are exposed to isopropanol both during pregnancyand through the period of weaning. During the time from just prior to birthuntil the end of weaning it would be difficult to transfer animals dailyto the inhalation chamber for the required exposure periods. This excessivehandling of the animals (particularly removal of the mother from the pups)would likely result in adverse effects on the pups which was not chemicallyrelated and would confound the interpretation of the results. This wouldbe particularly true in assessments of developmental neurotoxicity whereaberrant behavior might be easily be attributed to handling. In addition,if it was decided to expose both mothers and pups in an inhalation chamber,the nesting material required during the latter part of pregnancy and duringweaning could easily absorb vapors during an inhalation exposure, and thesaturated bedding could provide an important, yet unquantified, exposureto the test substance to both the mothers and the pups. For these reasons,EPA disagrees that inhalation route should be used for conducting reproductivetoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity tests. Further, EPA considersit advisable, for the ability to compare reproductive performance, thatthe developmental toxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, and reproductivetoxicity tests be conducted by similar routes. Administration by gavage has some distinct advantages for the developmentalneurotoxicity testing. The use of gavage administration permits relativelyprecise estimations of the dosages administered. By comparison, drinkingwater studies require estimates of individual water consumptions. Also,some spillage of water may occur during drinking and volatile chemicalsmay be lost. Furthermore, in the developmental neurotoxicity study, exposureextends through the period of weaning, and gavage administration ensuresthat exposure of the pups only occurs through the mother's milk. Since,as mentioned above, it is desirable to perform all the reproductive testsby the same route of administration, EPA believes that gavage administrationis the most appropriate route for these studies. b. While the Panel supported the use of inhalation exposure for most ofthe health effects testing, the Panel stated that the <T3>Drosophila</T3> assay and the in vivo cytogenetics assay should notbe conducted by inhalation exposure. The Panel contended that, since thedata from these assays will not be used directly for human risk assessment,the greater expense involved in inhalation studies is not justified underTSCA. In addition, the Panel contended that vapor phase exposure has providedinconclusive results in tests of glycol ethers (Ref. 7), and that testsof a similar compound, methanol, have been conducted by feeding. Finally,the Panel contended that the use of a feeding study would allow a moreready comparison with other <T3>Drosophila</T3> assays. EPA does not agree that feed should be the route of administration in the<T3>Drosophila</T3> assay because of the relative difficulty of determiningthe dosages administered by feed. There is no apparent major technicalobstacle to performing this study with isopropanol using vapor exposure.The study of glycol ethers by McGregor (Ref. 7) does not indicate thatthere is any inherent limitation to the use of vapor exposure, but, onthe contrary, demonstrates that this experimental system is feasible andhas been performed in the past. The inconclusive results reported in thisstudy were attributed by the authors to the metabolic status of <T3>Drosophila</T3> and not to the exposure conditions. Thus, EPA is requiringthat isopropanol be administered by vapor exposure or by injection. The Panel may choose to conduct the in vivo cytogenetic assay by a routeother than inhalation. EPA is requiring the other route to be either oralgavage or interperitoneal (IP). 2. <T3>Reproductive toxicity testing.</T3> The Panel stated that the availabledata on reproductive toxicity of isopropanol are adequate. The Panel citesexisting reproductive toxicity data in rats to indicate that reproductiveeffects are more severe in the first generation. The Panel also noted thata recently completed BIBRA one- generation reproductive toxicity study,currently under review in the United Kingdom, may provide the necessarydata to assess the reproductive toxicity of isopropanol. The question of one- vs. two-generation reproductive effects studies wasrecently evaluated by a panel of experts in a workshop sponsored by theEPA's Risk Assessment Forum. The Panel of experts concluded that, by itself,a one-generation reproductive effects study is insufficient to identifyall potential reproductive toxicants and that a two-generation study isneeded for an adequate assessment (Ref. 8). Thus, EPA considers that theone-generation study conducted by BIBRA, even when it becomes availablein the United States, will not provide the data needed for an adequateassessment of this endpoint. Because there is no benefit in delaying thetwo-generation reproductive toxicity testing for isopropanol until theBIBRA study becomes available, EPA is requiring testing for this endpointin this rule. 3. <T3>Developmental toxicity testing.</T3> The Panel recommended that EPAinclude a two-species developmental toxicity study in its final rule butstay the requirement to conduct testing in the rat until the results ofa rat developmental toxicity study conducted by BIBRA becomes available.It further recommended that at this juncture, following a public meeting,EPA could determine whether additional testing in the rat is needed. EPA concurs with the Panel's contention that the BIBRA study may fulfillthe data needs for developmental toxicity testing in rats. To assure thatadequate testing is available if BIBRA data are not submitted in a timelymanner, EPA is requiring a two-species developmental toxicity test in thisrule. The testing requirement in the rat will be reexamined after the BIBRAdata are received by EPA. 4. <T3>Developmental neurotoxicity testing.</T3> a. The Panel noted that inprevious test rules, developmental neurotoxicity tests have only been requiredwhen data exists to raise concern about this endpoint for the test compound,and that the tests were required as a tier-II type study. The Panel disagreedwith EPA's decision to use data on other short chain alcohols, ethanoland t-butanol, to support the decision to require developmental toxicitytesting of isopropanol. The Panel stated that studies by Nelson and co-workerson ethanol and 1-propanol (Refs. 9 and 10) only reported changes in neurotransmitterlevels and hence can only be used to support similar types of testing ratherthan the more extensive tests required in the proposed rule. EPA is concerned that data on other short chain alcohols have shown developmentalneurotoxic effects. As stated in the proposed rule, EPA is basing the developmentalneurotoxicity testing requirement for isopropanol on the authority of section4(a)(1)(B), not section 4(a)(1)(A), of TSCA. Because there is a high degreeof exposure to isopropanol, EPA has decided that testing should not bedelayed. b. The Panel also noted a number of technical issues with regard to theconduct of the developmental neurotoxicity tests. For instance, statisticalquestions concerning the number of animals required for each test and neuropathologyissues regarding such questions as the type of histologic stains to beused, the techniques for examining the spinal cord and other nerve tissues,and the measurement of brain tissues need to be resolved. The neuropathology issues were raised earlier in a July 9, 1987 letterfrom Dr. John L. O'Donoghue to the CMA Glycol Ethers Program concerningsimilar testing under a consent order for triethylene glycol ethers (Ref.11). These issues were subsequently addressed (Refs. 12 and 13). c. Finally, the Panel maintained that an even greater problem with regardto the developmental neurotoxicity tests is the lack of testing facilitiesthat can perform these tests by the required Good Laboratory Practice Standards(GLPS). On the basis of information available to EPA, it appears that some capabilityexists for conducting developmental neurotoxicity studies at this timeand additional capability will be available in the near future (Ref. 14).5. <T3>Neurotoxicity testing.</T3> a. The Panel stated that the existing studyin humans by Maizlish et al. (Ref. 15) provides sufficient data to indicatethat exposure to isopropanol does not result in any neurologic impairment.In this study, workers were exposed to isopropanol at an average concentrationof 161 ppm, with both naphtha (50 ppm) and hexane (39 ppm) also presentin the air. The Panel noted that neither hexane nor naphtha is metabolizedby alcohol dehydrogenase, nor would it be anticipated that these compoundswould induce this enzyme, and thus the metabolism of isopropanol shouldnot be affected by the co-exposure. In this study, no relation was observedbetween solvent exposure and 10 behavioral variables. The Panel contendedthat the lack of observed effects in humans is supported by the animaldata by Boughton (Ref. 16), who observed only slight reversible decrementin performance in rats maintained on drinking water containing sufficientisopropanol to result in weight loss in the test animals. The Panel statedthat this is sufficient evidence that isopropanol has little potentialto be a neurotoxic agent, and that EPA should not require further testing.EPA disagrees that the studies cited by the Panel provide sufficient datato evaluate the neurotoxicity of isopropanol. The study of Maizlish etal. has severe limitations. The entire exposed population in this studyconsisted of 240 workers in four plants; however, the subgroup referredto by the Panel was made up of only 26 individuals from one plant who signedconsent forms and were tested. Not only was this group small, but the authorsof the study were concerned with biases since only those who volunteeredwere tested. Also the extent of exposure was determined through an analysisof air in the breathing zone taken only during the week that the behavioraltesting was conducted. There is no data to indicate that the reported exposurewas representative of exposure in this plant. Possibly the most criticallimitation was with regard to study design. As the authors noted, thiswas a cross-sectional study which has many inherent limitations. The predominantconfounders are the healthy worker effect since workers who have ill healthare likely to either leave employment or be transferred to other jobs,and not be present at the time the study is conducted. In addition, subjectsare not followed up with time, and this does not permit evaluation of deteriorationof performance as the subjects age. Also, the early study by Boughton isinadequate, since only one dose was used, 5 percent in drinking water,and the only behavioral test performed was the activity and maze learningtests which would allow for only a limited ability to detect neurologicaleffects. Taken together, these two studies are inadequate to predict thepotential for isopropanol to produce neurologic effects, and are insufficientto justify elimination of the proposed testing. b. The Panel stated that the subchronic neurotoxicity test should not beinitiated until completion of the acute study. The benefits cited by thePanel include the ability to identify appropriate doses for the subchronicstudy, and the identification of potential important endpoints in the acutestudy which may be monitored more closely in the subchronic test. EPA agrees that there are advantages to conducting these tests sequentially.There are, however, disadvantages which include delays in the receipt ofdata, and the inability to conduct the acute tests as a satellite of thesubchronic test. Since it is estimated by the Panel that performing thetests sequentially would result in an extension of the reporting requirementsfrom 15 to 30 months, EPA has decided that this would unduly delay obtainingthe needed data and that the schedule as outlined in the proposed ruleshould be maintained. c. The Panel stated that EPA must resolve technical issues with regardto the adult neurotoxicity tests before the tests are required. Some ofthese issues are the same as discussed for the developmental neurotoxicitytests and have been addressed. (Refs. 12 and 13). In addition, the Panel notes that for each of the proposed motor activitytests, ``...each test or control group must be designed to contain a sufficientnumber of animals at the completion of the study to detect a 40 percentchange in activity of the test groups relative to the control group with90 percent power at the 5 percent level.'' The Panel maintains that testinglaboratories and industrial company laboratories have insufficient experiencewith these test protocols to be able to predict the number of animals needed.Data would not be available from published studies since published articlesoften underestimate variation, and these tests have been conducted by universitygroups which have a great deal of experience in conducting such tests.Although the Panel expects that many of these issues will be resolved byneurotoxicity testing that is now underway, the Panel wants the adult neurotoxicitytesting to be stayed if unresolved issues remain at the time of promulgationof the final rule on isopropanol. As noted in the memorandum from Rees (Ref. 13), some judgment is requiredin determining the parameters to be used in the determination of samplesize. The determination of sample size to allow for confidence in experimentalresults is not limited to neurotoxicity testing, but is an integral partof all test protocols. It is professional judgement which allows an investigatorto determine the number of animals needed and doses to be used to havesufficient animals at the termination of the study for valid interpretationof the results. EPA believes that, with the information gained by ongoingtesting and the use of professional judgment, it will be possible to reasonablypredict the numbers of animals needed for the adult neurotoxicity tests,and that the small amount of uncertainty involved with regard to the questionof number of animals does not justify a delay in testing. 6. <T3>Mutagenicity testing.</T3> a. The Panel agreed that additional assessmentof the genotoxic potential of isopropanol is warranted; however, it recommendedthat the first tier tests be modified. The study of Thompson (Ref. 17)compared 181 compounds tested for induction of chromosomal aberrationsin both in vitro and in vivo assays, and reported that similar resultswere obtained with 126 compounds while 53 were positive when tested invitro and negative in vivo, 2 compounds were positive in vivo and negativein vitro, and 35 had equivocal results. The Panel stated that this dataindicates that in vitro chromosomal aberration tests are not predictiveof results obtained in vivo, and hence the requirement for in vitro testingfor chromosomal aberrations should be eliminated and an in vivo micronucleustest performed instead. The Panel also stated that the available data onclastogenic effects in vitro, negative tests for meiotic nondisjunctionin <T3>Neurospora crassa</T3> and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in culturedV79 cells, indicate that it is unlikely that isopropanol will be activein other in vitro systems. In addition, since EPA considers the in vivochromosome aberration assay to be equivalent to the in vivo micronucleustest, the Panel requested that the rule be modified to substitute the latterfor the former. Further, the micronucleus test is substantially less expensiveand hence fulfills the requirement under TSCA of cost effective testing.EPA is not requiring the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay for isopropanol.The study of Von der Hude et al. (Ref. 18), which evaluated the potentialinduction of SCE in vitro, has become available since the evaluation ofthe data for the proposed rule and fulfills the requirement for an in vitrocytogenetic assay. This recently published study reported on an assay ofisopropanol at four concentrations, 3.3, 10.0, 33.3, and 100 mM, in thepresence and absence of metabolic activation, and determined that isopropanolwas negative. The highest concentration tested was reported to producecytotoxicity as indicated by a delay in the cell cycle. In regards to the Panel's arguments for elimination of the in vitro cytogeneticassay as a general rule, EPA does not agree with the Panel. The study byThompson should not be interpreted to indicate that in vitro testing isunnecessary. In that report, the in vitro tests identified more compoundsas potential genotoxic agents than did the in vivo tests. As noted by theauthors, the occurrence of activity in vitro and not in vivo may resultfrom detoxification mechanisms or barriers present in the whole animal.It should be concluded from this study that these ``false positives'' areonly false positives as related to the in vivo bone marrow assay, whilethe activity observed in vitro may be expressed at other target sites.b. The Panel agreed to perform Tier III tests if earlier results are positive;however, the Panel noted that there is some controversy over the mousevisible specific locus (MVSL) test, that EPA is reexamining the test, andthat there is a question whether this relatively expensive test can actuallybe performed. The Panel recommended that the EPA not require any Tier IIItests in the rule, but instead reopen the rulemaking proceedings if TierIII tests are to be required. EPA is requiring the MVSL test in this rule, but plans to amend all testrules requiring the MVSL through a separate rule. EPA has proposed separatelyto amend the requirement for the MVSL (40 CFR 798.5200) for proposed andfinal test rules promulgated under section 4(a) of TSCA. EPA plans to allowtest sponsors of current test rules, including this rule for isopropanol,to choose either the MVSL or the mouse biochemical specific locus test(MBSL), after it is promulgated, to test for heritable mutations in mammals.EPA believes that the MBSL and MVSL are comparable tests and are acceptablefor detecting this endpoint in mammals. The test guideline for the MBSLwas proposed on December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51847) to be codified at 40 CFR798.5195. EPA is proposing a reporting requirement of 51 months for thecompletion of testing for either the MVSL or MBSL once triggered. The provisionin this final rule for public review prior to requiring Tier III testingwill permit EPA and the public to address many of the concerns raised bythe Panel with regard to Tier III testing. Requiring the Tier III MVSLtesting in the rule will permit a more expeditious treatment of questionsconcerning Tier III testing than would be obtained by requiring the reopeningof the rulemaking process. 7. <T3>Oncogenicity testing.</T3> The Panel's comments reiterate the positionit took during the consent order negotiations that the design of the oncogenicitystudy be determined by evaluation of data on the pharmacokinetics, subchronic,and mutagenicity testing of isopropanol. After evaluation of this data,a determination would be made as to whether a one species or two speciesoncogenicity study would be required. EPA requires data from two species under its oncogenicity testing guidelines(40 CFR 798.3300) and cancer risk assessment guidelines (51 FR 33992).For chemicals of unknown activity, such as isopropanol, two mammalian speciesare needed to increase the power of the test to detect potential carcinogens.Also, a negative single-species bioassay would be insufficient evidenceto exonerate isopropanol as a potential carcinogen (Ref. 3). 8. <T3>Pharmacokinetics testing.</T3> a. The Panel did not dispute that pharmacokineticsdata were insufficient. The Panel argued that the reporting requirementsspecified in the proposed rule on isopropanol will make it necessary toinitiate subchronic toxicity studies prior to completion of the pharmacokineticsstudies. This would preclude use of the pharmacokinetics data for settingdose levels for the subchronic studies. The Panel suggested that it willbe necessary to adjust the maximum dose level so that it does not exceedthe metabolic saturation point, as defined from the results of pharmacokineticsstudies. The Panel proposed that the subchronic and chronic toxicity studiesbe delayed to allow for completion of the pharmacokinetics studies. The proposed reporting requirements allow 15 months from the effectivedate of the final rule for completion of the pharmacokinetics study andthe 90-day subchronic study, and 53 months for completion of the 2-yearchronic study. EPA believes that the reporting requirements allow sufficienttime for completion of the pharmacokinetics study and preliminary dataanalysis prior to initiating the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies.b. The Panel suggested that an additional 9 months will be required todevelop inhalation exposure methods and assay procedures for isopropanoland its metabolites, and that these tasks will be time-consuming becausethe metabolism departments of many testing facilities are unaccustomedto using the inhalation route for pharmacokinetics and metabolism studies.EPA conducted a study to assess the availability of adequate test facilitiesand concluded that there will be test facilities and personnel to performthe testing specified in this rule. Copies of the study, ``Chemical TestingIndustry: Profile of Toxicological Testing,'' can be obtained through theNational Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,VA 22161 (PB 82- 140773). With respect to assay procedures, the Panel'scomments indicated that methods already exist for determining isopropanoland its metabolites in biological materials. Therefore, EPA believes that15 months allows sufficient time for completion of the pharmacokineticstesting. c. The Panel suggested that pharmacokinetics data for the mouse may beuseful for interpreting mouse bioassays. The Panel indicated that it isprepared to work with EPA to initiate such testing voluntarily. EPA agreesthat this data would be extremely useful and encourages the Panel to performthese studies on a voluntary basis. d. The Panel would like EPA to specify whether inhalation exposures areto be conducted in dynamic or static exposure systems. EPA is requiringinhalation exposures to be conducted in dynamic exposure systems. Inhalationtoxicity studies are generally performed under dynamic exposure conditions;guidelines for subchronic inhalation toxicity studies specify dynamic exposures(see 40 CFR 798.2450). It is also the most consistent with the goals ofrisk assessment extrapolations, which are based on assuming continuousexposures to a constant concentration of air-borne chemicals. Furthermore,it is the only exposure system in which exposure to volatile metabolitescan be prevented. e. The Panel expressed concern about the requirement for use of radioisotopesin the pharmacokinetics studies. The Panel suggested that very large quantitiesof radioactivity would be required for dynamic inhalation exposures andthat incorporation of radiolabel into tissue constituents may lead to confusingor misleading data on distribution of the test substance. EPA believes that use of radiolabel in conjunction with chromatographictechniques provides the most reliable and sensitive means for detectingmetabolites and for evaluating mass balance for the carbon skeleton ofthe test substance. The objective of the metabolite identification requirementsspecified in the proposed rule is to identify the major metabolites ofisopropanol in tissues and excreta, to provide data for evaluating thecontribution of metabolism to detoxification or activation of isopropanolin the test species. If metabolic incorporation of the radiolabel intotissue constituents is a quantitatively significant metabolic fate of isopropanol,then this should be documented with data regarding the identity of theincorporated label. Such incorporation may represent fixation of CO<T2>2</T2> derived from the degradation of isopropanol or may representa covalent interaction of tissue constituents with reactive metabolitesof isopropanol. In either case, it will be important to document the natureof the incorporation. Indeed, only with the use of radiolabeled isopropanolis this kind of rigorous analysis possible. f. The Panel expressed concern about the requirement for collection ofexhaled air, urine, and feces excreta during nose-only or head-only inhalationexposures, and indicated that the latter is not technically feasible. EPAagrees that collection of multiple samples of urine and feces from suchan apparatus may be very difficult and has modified the guideline accordingly.g. The Panel expressed concern about the definition for percent absorptionthat is cited in the proposed rule. The definition given by EPA is ``...100times the ratio between total excretion of radioactivity following oralor inhalation administration and total excretion of radioactivity followingintravenous administration of test substance.'' EPA agrees that for compoundsadministered by the oral route, this calculation may overestimate the actualpercent absorption by that amount of chemical that passes through the gastrointestinaltract without absorption. Thus, EPA has modified the guideline to reflectthis change. h. The Panel expressed concern over the selection of an appropriate toxicityendpoint on which to base the selection of the high dose level to be usedin the pharmacokinetics studies. The objective of the high-dose level study is to examine the absorption,distribution, metabolism and excretion of the test substance at the highestdose level that can be achieved without severely perturbing or impairingthe above mechanisms. Dose levels that produce frank effects, e.g., convulsions,coma, and death, are clearly unacceptable since the disposition mechanismsare likely to be severely perturbed or impaired in severely poisoned animals.Ideally, the high dose level should be the lowest observable effect level.This effect will vary depending on the chemical and its toxicologic characteristics.In the case of isopropanol, for which narcosis represents an importantcritical effect, the dose level at or just below that required to producemild symptoms of narcosis seems appropriate. The relevant observation periodin which to define the effect would include the exposure and sampling period,since it would not be productive to expose an animal to a dose that resultsin unconsciousness or frank effects after the exposure and before the samplingwas completed. Note that toxicity will define the highest dose level acceptablefor testing; however, this does not preclude testing of several levelsbelow the high-dose level, although EPA requires that only one nontoxicdose level be examined. C. TSCA Sections 4 and 12(B) RequirementsPGC proposed that EPA exclude small manufacturers and importers from therequirements of section 4. PGC suggested this exclusion include productionor importation of 25,000 lb/yr or less. In addition, PGC suggested thatEPA eliminate the requirement for all section 12(b) reporting for isopropanol,since the benefit would not be commensurate with the burden that this reportingrequirement would place upon EPA. If all section 12(b) reporting is notexempted, then PGC further recommended that a small quantity exemption(shipment of 25,000 lb/yr or less) be used to eliminate the burden to smallcompanies. Since these issues apply to all section 4 rules and consent orders andthe commenter has not distinguished how this rule is any more burdensomethan other section 4 rules, EPA rejects these comments. EPA is continuingto look at the burden of section 4 and 12(b) requirements. EPA has proposedamendments to its procedural rule that would alleviate the requirementof certain manufacturers to submit letters of intent to test or submitexemption applications (54 FR 21237; May 17, 1989). EPA has also proposedamendments to its section 12(b) rules (54 FR 29524; July 12, 1989) to reducethe burden of section 12(b) notification as it relates to section 4. D. Summary of NRDC's CommentsIn general, NRDC concurred with the testing program outlined by EPA inits proposed rule for isopropanol. Specifically, NRDC agreed that oncogenicitytesting must be conducted in two species and that a two-generation studyis necessary to adequately assess reproductive effects. NRDC recommendedthat the BIBRA study on the developmental effects be used to replace therequired developmental testing in the rat only if it is submitted and reviewedin a timely fashion. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Final Test Rule for Isopropanol</ITAG>A. Findings EPA is basing its final health effects testing requirements for isopropanolon the authority of section 4(a)(1)(B) of TSCA. EPA finds that isopropanol is produced in substantial quantities and thatthere is or may be substantial human exposure to isopropanol from its manufacture,processing, use, and disposal. The available data on isopropanol, discussedin Unit II. of the preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 8638), show thatthe annual production volume of isopropanol has been in excess of 1 billionpounds since 1956, and that it was ranked 50th among chemicals producedin the United States in 1985. There is or may be a substantial number ofworkers exposed to isopropanol from activities related to its manufacturing,processing, distribution in commerce, and use. The National OccupationalHazard Survey (NOHS) conducted by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) from 1972 to 1974 estimated that there were 8,899,594exposures in 357,173 plants, potentially exposing 5,483,862 people to isopropanolin the workplace in 1970. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES)estimates that 1,857,972 workers, 60 percent of whom were female, werepotentially exposed to isopropanol in the workplace in 1980. Isopropanol is used as a solvent and is a component of numerous industrialproducts, consumer products, and commercial sprays. The above uses mayresult in widespread exposure to workers and consumers (Ref. 5). EPA believesthat exposures associated with the manufacture, processing, use, and disposalof isopropanol and its products provide a sufficient basis for a findingthat there is or may be substantial human exposure under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B)for isopropanol.  Under TSCA Section 4(a)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii), EPA finds that existing dataare insufficient to reasonably determine or predict the subchronic, reproductive,developmental, neurotoxic, developmental neurotoxic, mutagenic, and oncogeniceffects of human exposure to isopropanol resulting from its manufacture,processing, use, and disposal. EPA also finds that there are insufficientdata to reasonably predict and compare the absorption, distribution, metabolism,and excretion of isopropanol in the body as a result of oral or inhalationexposure due to isopropanol's manufacture, processing, use, and disposal,and that an oral/inhalation comparative pharmacokinetics study of isopropanolis necessary to develop such data. The reasons data are insufficient arefurther discussed in Unit II. B. of this preamble. EPA believes that thedata generated from this testing will be relevant to a determination asto whether the manufacture, processing, use, and disposal of isopropanoldoes or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.B. Required Testing and Test StandardsOn the basis of these findings, EPA is requiring that certain health effectstesting be conducted for isopropanol in accordance with scientific testguidelines set forth in 40 CFR 795 and 798. To assess the degree of toxicological activity of isopropanol upon varioustarget organs, EPA is requiring that isopropanol be tested for subchronictoxicity by inhalation (40 CFR 798.2450). EPA is requiring that testing for reproductive effects (40 CFR 798.4700),and developmental toxicity (40 CFR 798.4900) be done by gavage. To assess the effects of acute neurotoxic inhalation exposures to isopropanol,EPA is requiring an acute neurobehavioral toxicity evaluation consistingof a functional observational battery (40 CFR 798.6050), and measurementof motor activity (40 CFR 798.6200). To assess the neurotoxic effects of repeated inhalation exposures to isopropanol,EPA is requiring a subchronic neurobehavioral toxicity evaluation consistingof a neuropathologic evaluation of tissues perfused in situ (40 CFR 798.6400),a functional observational battery (40 CFR 798.6050), and measurement ofmotor activity (40 CFR 798.6200). This required battery of neurotoxic evaluationmay be combined with the subchronic test (40 CFR 798.2450). To assess the developmental neurotoxicity potential of isopropanol, EPAis requiring a developmental neurotoxicity evaluation (40 CFR 795.250).To assess the potential for isopropanol to cause gene mutations, EPA isrequiring that testing be conducted for gene mutations in cells in culture(40 CFR 798.5300). If the results of the cells in culture test are positive,a <T3>Drosophila</T3> sex-linked recessive lethal assay (SLRL) shall be conducted(40 CFR 798.5275). A positive result in the SLRL assay shall trigger amouse visible specific locus (MVSL) test (40 CFR 798.5200). If the cellsin culture test is negative, no further testing is required. If the SLRLassay is negative, the MVSL test is not required. To assess the potential for isopropanol to cause chromosomal aberrations,EPA is requiring that an in vivo bone marrow assay (40 CFR 798.5385) beconducted. Should the in vivo bone marrow test results prove negative,no further chromosomal aberrations testing is required. If the resultsof the in vivo bone marrow test are positive, a dominant-lethal assay isrequired (40 CFR 798.5450). A positive result in the dominant-lethal assaywill trigger a heritable translocation assay (40 CFR 798.5460). If the results from the dominant-lethal assay and/or the SLRL are positive,EPA will hold a public program review prior to requiring initiation ofthe heritable translocation and/or mouse specific locus testing. Publicparticipation in this program review will be in the form of written publiccomments or a public meeting. Request for public comments or notificationof a public meeting, if one is held, will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Should EPA determine, based on the weight ofthe evidence then available, that proceeding to the heritable translocationtest and/or MVSL assay is no longer warranted, EPA will propose to repealthat test requirement and, after public comment, will issue a final amendmentto rescind the requirement. For a more detailed discussion concerning mutagenicitytiered testing and program review, see the final test rule for the C<T2>9</T2> aromatic hydrocarbon fraction (50 FR 20662; May 17, 1985). EPA believes that the oncogenicity testing is justified without waitingfor the results of gene mutation tests. EPA is thus requiring a 2-yearinhalation bioassay in two species (40 CFR 798.3300). To aid in the assessment of the potential toxicity of isopropanol for riskassessment purposes, EPA is requiring metabolism and pharmacokinetics testingby the oral and inhalation routes of exposure. EPA believes this testingof isopropanol is necessary to reduce uncertainties associated with theextrapolation of test data from high to low doses, from species to species,and from one route of exposure to another. Pharmacokinetics testing inrats is being required to develop comparative, dose-dependent, oral andinhalation absorption, tissue distribution, bioaccumulation, metabolism,and excretion data. These data are needed for extrapolation purposes. Thenecessary extrapolations can be made on the basis of metabolism and pharmacokineticsdata obtained from studies performed by both routes of isopropanol administration.Repeated dose studies are needed to learn whether multiple exposures modifythe metabolism and/or pharmacokinetics of isopropanol. Although there aresome human and rat data, these are not adequate to support the requiredextrapolations. EPA is establishing the TSCA health effects test guidelines as the teststandards for the purpose of the required tests for isopropanol. The TSCAtest guidelines for health effects testing specify generally accepted minimumconditions for determining the health effects for substances like isopropanolto which humans are expected to be exposed. C. Test SubstanceEPA is requiring that isopropanol of at least 99.8 percent purity be usedas the test substance. Commercial isopropanol of such purity is availableaccording to comments received from the Panel (Ref. 1). EPA has specifieda relatively pure substance for testing to best evaluate the effects attributableto isopropanol itself. In addition, radiolabeled 14C isopropanol is requiredfor the pharmacokinetics. D. Persons Required to Test Section 4(b)(3)(B) of TSCA specifies that the activities for which EPAmakes section 4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,use, and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testinga chemical. Because EPA has found that there are insufficient data andexperience to reasonably determine or predict the effects on human healthfrom manufacture, processing, use, and disposal of isopropanol, EPA isrequiring that persons who manufacture and/or process, or who intend tomanufacture and/or process, isopropanol, other than as an impurity, atany time from the effective date of the final test rule to the end of thereimbursement period be subject to the testing requirements in this finalrule. While EPA has not identified any byproduct manufacturers of isopropanol,such persons are covered by the requirements of this test rule. The reimbursementperiod will end 5 years after the last final report is submitted to EPAor an amount of time equal to that which was required to develop data,whichever is later. E. Reporting Requirements EPA requires that all data developed under this rule be reported in accordancewith its TSCA GLPS, which appear in 40 CFR Part 792. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors are required to submit individual study plans at least 45days prior to the initiation of each study. EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data.

Final rules interpreting the requirements of section 12(b) arein 40 CFR Part 707. In brief, as of the effective date of the final testrule, an exporter of isopropanol must report to EPA the first annual exportor intended export of isopropanol to each country. EPA will notify theforeign country concerning the test rule for the chemical. F. Enforcement ProvisionsEPA considers failure to comply with any aspect of a section 4 rule tobe a violation of section 15 of TSCA. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes it unlawfulfor any person to fail or refuse to comply with any rule or order issuedunder section 4. Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any personto fail or refuse to: (1) Establish or maintain records, (2) submit reports,notices, or other information, or (3) permit access to or copying of recordsrequired by TSCA. Section 15(4) makes it unlawful for any person to failor refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by TSCA section 11.Section 11 applies to any ``...establishment, facility, or other premisesin which chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured, processed, stored,or held before or after their distribution in commerce...'' EPA considersa testing facility to be a place where the chemical is held or stored and,therefore, subject to inspection. Laboratory inspections and data auditswill be conducted periodically in accordance with the authority and proceduresoutlined in TSCA section 11 by duly designated representatives of EPA forthe purpose of determining compliance with the final rule for isopropanol.These inspections may be conducted for purposes which include verificationthat testing has begun, schedules are being met, and reports accuratelyreflect the underlying raw data, interpretations, and evaluations, andto determine compliance with TSCA GLPS and the test standards establishedin the rule. EPA's authority to inspect a testing facility also derives from section4(b)(1) of TSCA, which directs EPA to promulgate standards for the developmentof test data. These standards are defined in section 3(12)(B) of TSCA toinclude those requirements necessary to assure that data developed undertesting rules are reliable and adequate, and to include such other requirementsas are necessary to provide such assurance. EPA maintains that laboratoryinspections are necessary to provide this assurance. Violators of TSCA are subject to criminal and civil liability. Personswho submit materially misleading or false information in connection withthe requirement of any provision of this rule may be subject to penaltieswhich may be calculated as if they never submitted their data. Under thepenalty provisions of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 of TSCA could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for eachviolation with each day of operation in violation constituting a separateviolation. This provision would be applicable primarily to manufacturerswho fail to submit a letter of intent or an exemption request and who continuemanufacturing after the deadlines for such submissions. This provisionalso applies to processors that fail to submit a letter of intent or anexemption application and continue processing after EPA has notified themof their obligation to submit such documents (see 40 CFR 790.28(b)). Knowingor willful violations could lead to the imposition of criminal penaltiesof up to $25,000 for each day of violation, imprisonment for up to 1 year,or both. In determining the amount of penalty, EPA will take into accountthe seriousness of the violation and the degree of culpability of the violatoras well as all the other factors listed in TSCA section 16. Other remediesare available to EPA under section 17 of TSCA, such as seeking an injunctionto restrain violations of TSCA section 4. Individuals as well as corporations could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates provisionsof TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as wellas companies themselves. In particular, this includes individuals who reportfalse information or who cause it to be reported. In addition, the submissionof false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements is a violation under 18U.S.C. 1001. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis of Final Rule </ITAG>To assess the potential economic impact of this rule, EPA has preparedan economic analysis (Ref. 19) that evaluates the potential for significanteconomic impact on the industry as a result of the required testing. Theeconomic analysis estimates that costs of conducting the required testingand evaluates the potential for significant adverse economic impact asa result of these tests costs by examining four market characteristicsof isopropanol: (1) price sensitivity of demand; (2) market expectations;(3) industry cost characteristics; and (4) industry structure. Total testing costs for the final rule for isopropanol are estimated torange from $2.6 to $3.8 million. To predict the financial decision makingpractices of manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualizedcosts are compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period to finance the testing expenditurein the first year. The annualized test costs, using a 7 percent cost of capital over a periodof 15 years, range from $289,000 to $412,000. Based on 1987 productionof 1.4 billion pounds, the unit test costs range from $0.00021 to $0.00029per pound. These costs are equivalent to 0.09 to 0.13 percent of the currentprice of $0.23 per pound. EPA believes that the potential for adverse economic impact resulting fromthe costs of testing is low. This conclusion is based on the followingobservations: 1. The annualized cost of testing is very low, at approximately 0.13 percentof product prices in the upper bound case. 2. Demand for isopropanol does not appear to be sensitive to a price increasein this range. Refer to the economic analysis which is contained in the public recordfor this rule making for a complete discussion of test cost estimationand potential for economic impact resulting from these costs. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel </ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``...the reasonably foreseeableavailability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testingrequired under the rule.'' Therefore, EPA conducted a study to assess theavailability of test facilities and personnel to handle the additionaldemand for testing services created by section 4 test rules. Copies ofthe study, ``Chemical Testing Industry: Profile of Toxicological Testing,''can be obtained through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS),5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB 82-140773). On the basisof this study, EPA believes that there will be available test facilitiesand personnel to perform the testing specified in this rule. EPA has reviewed the availability of contract laboratory facilities toconduct the neurotoxicity testing requirements (Ref. 20) and believes thatfacilities will be made available for conducting these tests. The laboratoryreview indicates that few laboratories are currently conducting these testsaccording to TSCA test guidelines and TSCA GLPS. However, the barriersfaced by testing laboratories to gear up for conducting these tests arenot formidable. Laboratories will need to invest in testing equipment andpersonnel training, but EPA believes that these investments will be recoveredas the neurotoxicity testing programs under TSCA section 4 and the FederalInsecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) continue. EPA's expectationsof laboratory availability were borne out under the testing requirementsof the C<T2>9</T2> aromatic hydrocarbon fraction test rule (50 FR 20675; May 17,1985). Pursuant to that rule, the manufacturers were able to contract witha laboratory to conduct the testing according to TSCA guidelines and TSCAGLPS. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule is not major because it does notmeet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order; i.e.,it will not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,will not cause a major increase in prices, and will not have a significantadverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterprises to competewith foreign enterprises. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA, and any EPA responses to those comments, are included in therulemaking record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> Pub. L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), EPA is certifyingthat this test rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses because: (1) They are not likely to performtesting themselves, or to participate in the organization of the testingeffort; (2) they will experience only very minor cost, if any, in securingexemption from testing requirements; and (3) they are unlikely to be affectedby reimbursement requirements. C. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisfinal rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>., Pub. L. 96-511, December 11, 1980), and has assignedcontrol number 2070-0033. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 1,190 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento, Chief, Information Policy Branch (PM-223), U.S. EPA, 401 M St., SW,Washington, DC 20460 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,OMB, Washington, DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 795 and 799 </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Testing, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Chemicals,Laboratories, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 22, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
