Watkins todayannounced a 10-point plan to ``chart a new course'' for what hecalled the department's failed system of protecting the environmentand public health from nuclear weapons production.   Watkins also said he would press for Senate confirmation ofVictor Stello as his chief assistant for nuclear weapons even ifinvestigations of Stello's controversial background reveal ``somechinks in his armour.''   Bush announced the Stello nomination as assistant secretary fordefense programs last week.   In 1987 a Senate panel conducted a hearing on whether Stello, asthe staff chief of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was guilty ofimproprieties in connection with a commission investigation of theTennessee Valley Authority.   The probe included the question of whether Stello improperlyadvised the manager of nuclear power at TVA on how to respond to acommission inquiry about the readiness of a plant underconstruction. Stello denied any improprieties.   ``If he has some chinks in his armour ... so be it,'' Watkinstold a news conference before flying to New Mexico to tour a desertsite on which the department is building the nation's firstpermanment dump for waste generated by the weapons program.   He disclosed that the dump, which was scheduled to open inSeptember, would not start receiving any waste until sometime nextyear.   Watkins said Stello has the knowledge, experience and commitmentto perform the job, which Watkins said is one the most importantmanagement spots in the department.   Watkins said the Stello nomination was part of a broader effortto improve Energy Department management of the nuclear weaponsprogram, which has been crippled in recent years by a series ofmechanical failures and questions about safety.   The program, conducted through 17 major weapons facilities in 12states, produces plutonium and other nuclear materials for theweapons, assembles the arms and conducts tests on them.   ``I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I have seen overmy first few months in office,'' Watkins said. ``As a result, I mustcontinue to implement measures that can lead the department to a newculture which takes pride in being good stewards of public lands....''   Among the measures announced by Watkins:   _Creation of a set of environmental ``tiger teams'' to conductindependent assessments of whether the weapons plants are complyingwith federal and state laws.   _Changing the terms of department contracts with the privatecompanies that run the weapons plants, to put more emphasis onrewards for safety and environmental compliance.   _Accelerating the cleanup of the weapons plants by allocating anadditional $325 million for the budget year beginning Oct. 1,bringing the total for the year to $2.4 billion.   Also today, a group of 21 environmental, scientific and churchgroups sued the Energy Department to try to force a broad publicreview of plans for modernizing the weapons plants.   The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington said thedepartment should be compelled to prepare a ProgrammaticEnvironmental Impact Statement, a comprehensive analysis of theenvironmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives.   Watkins, at his news conference, declined to comment directly onthe suit except to say he was committed to ensuring full compliancewith all environmental requirements.   The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental groupthat announced the suit, said the department is required by theNational Environmental Policy Act to prepare a public review of itsmodernization plans.   ``It is time DOE came clean with the American public about itsplans for what is really one of the nation's largest and mostdangerous industrial operations,'' said Dan W. Reicher, an attorneyfor the group.   Among the groups that joined in the suit are the EnvironmentalPolicy Institute, Greenpeace, the Federation of American Scientists,the Lawyers Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control Inc., and thePhysicians for Social Responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
