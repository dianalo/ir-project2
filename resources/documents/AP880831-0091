(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential nominee GeorgeBush said today that ``the waiting period for action on acid rainis over'' and promised to support a program to reduce emissions bythe year 2,000.   In turning his attention to environmental issues, the vicepresident visited a park alongside Lake Erie near Detroit where hesaid the specifics of his acid rain program could be worked outlater with Congress, ``but we must have a clear commitment toemissions reductions, a clear time table.''   Aides traveling with the vice president said his pledge wasdesigned to demonstrate that he would go beyond the steps takenduring the Reagan administration to clean up acid rain.   The president has been criticized by environmentalists forfailing to do more to solve the problem during his two terms inoffice. Earlier this month, however, Reagan gave the go-ahead forcontinuing negotiations toward U.S. participation in aninternational treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acidrain.   The administration had been divided on United Nations-sponsorednegotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, toward a treaty that wouldfreeze emissions of nitrogen oxides until 1996.   In a speech prepared for delivery, Bush said, ``I am anenvironmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days as acongressman ... and I always will be.''   Aside from acid rain, he proposed several steps to clean up theenvironment, including a global conference on the issue at theWhite House at which all nations would be welcome.   He also called for implementation of a protocol alreadynegotiated to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides. He said theSuperfund established to clean up toxic waste dumps has enoughmoney for the job and said the Environmental Protection Agencyshould use its authority to enforce a program.   ``Polluters should pay,'' the vice president said.   Bush called for a ``zero tolerance'' policy for polluterssimilar to the one used to combat drugs.   On the acid rain issue, Bush said, ``the time for study alonehas passed. ... As president I will ask for a program to cutmillions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 andto significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''   ``I will work out the exact amount and the exact methodologywith the Congress,'' he said.   Bush addressed the environment issue on a brief campaign trip toMichigan regarded by strategists of both parties as a keybattleground for the fall campaign. The state has 20 electoralvotes.   For the first time in several days Bush made no reference to hisDemocratic rival Michael Dukakis in prepared remarks, but aidessaid the vice president was considering a trip to Boston Harborlater in the week to dramatize a pollution problem in theMassachusetts governor's home state.   Later in the week, Bush, who has proposed a ban on oceandumping, also will visit several beach sites in New Jersey and NewEngland.   Bush aides said that the vice president would continue hisenvironmental pitch on a campaign swing to the West Coast that willbegin on Labor Day. The aides said this may follow a jointappearance with running mate Sen. Dan Quayle at a park in JerseyCity, N.J., across from the Statue of Liberty, where Ronald Reaganlaunched his campaign on Labor Day 1980.   Bush on Tuesday wound up four days of attacks on Dukakis'defense stands by telling an American Legion post at Fort Campbell,Ky., he had ``deep, wide and worrisome'' differences with theDemocratic nominee on defense issues.   ``If he doesn't want to modernize his snow blower, that's hisconcern,'' Bush said, ``But if he doesn't modernize our weaponssystems, that puts the national security of the United States inconsiderable risk.''   The barbed reference to Dukakis' decades-old snow blower,highlighted in a film at the Democratic National Convention,brought cheers from Bush's audience of military veterans.   Bush, a decorated World War II torpedo bomber pilot, describedhimself as ``tested in combat'' in his talk in which he did notmention Quayle, whose service in the Indiana National Guard duringthe Vietnam war has become a heated campaign issue.   However, at an earlier rally Tuesday at North Carolina WesleyanCollege in Rocky Mount, N.C., Bush voiced strong praise for Quayle.   ``I'm proud of my running mate... It's nice to have a runningmate going in the same general direction as I am... We'll do justfine,'' Bush told several thousand students.   Meanwhile, Bush stood firmly behind his decision to agree to nomore than two presidential debates with Dukakis, suggesting anymore would bore U.S. viewers. The Democrats are asking for threedebates between Dukakis and Bush.   Talks in Washington between Bush and Dukakis representativesbroke down on Tuesday after Bush Campaign Manager James A. BakerIII refused to budge from the two-debate format, with an additionaldebate for vice presidential contenders. Talks were to resume onThursday.   ``This is a firm position ... This is our only offer,'' saidBush chief of staff Craig Fuller.</TEXT></DOC>
