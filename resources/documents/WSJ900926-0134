The device detects fires involving polyvinyl chloride, acommon cable insulation material used in the electricalwiring for nearly all homes and businesses. Polyvinylchloride, or PVC, also commonly is used in telephoneswitching offices and data centers, covering the connectorsbetween personal computers and large mainframe computersystems.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The purpose of the device is to detect a fire very earlyon,&quot; explains Glen Neuburger, who invented the fire detectorfor Bell Communications, also known as Bellcore. WithPVC-related fires, Mr. Neuburger says, &quot;a few minutes canmean the difference between a minor, localized event and onethat can cause widespread damage to remote equipment.&quot;   In June 1988, a fire involving PVC gutted a two-storyIllinois Bell Telephone Co. building in the Chicago suburb ofHinsdale, Ill. The fire crippled key elements of thecompany's central switching office and fiber-optic network.It also knocked out service for about 35,000 customers.   Bellcore's zinc-based device works by &quot;sensing&quot; a PVC firein its initial stage, reacting chemically to the presence ofhydrogen chloride gas. The gas, emitted when PVC overheats orburns, is extremely corrosive and destructive to electronicequipment. It also can cause severe irritation to workers'throat and lungs.   Other sensors detect fires by &quot;seeing&quot; the smoke, usinglight scattering technologies, or by &quot;feeling&quot; the heat,using thermal sensing devices. Accordingly, in fires thatdon't involve PVC, the Bellcore device wouldn't trigger analarm. The device &quot;isn't meant to replace fire detectors,&quot;says Mr. Neuburger, &quot;but to work in conjunction with them.&quot;   Bellcore, the research arm for the seven regional Bellcompanies, is banned from manufacturing such devices itself.That restriction is part of the consent decree that broke upthe Bell System in 1984.   Instead, Bellcore licenses its technology. Several of theregional Bells have expressed interest in the product.BellSouth Corp. has been testing the device in its switchingoffices in Kentucky.   The device is expected to cost about the same asconventional smoke detectors used in office buildings today.   As its active sensing element, Bellcore's fire detectoruses an inexpensive quartz crystal coated with zinc andactivated by electrical current. The crystal is calibrated tovibrate at a certain frequency. The sensor is attached to apalm-sized computer that monitors frequency changes.   Zinc is one of the prominent metal finishes used intelecommunications equipment. When hydrogen chloride gas ispresent, zinc corrodes and forms zinc chloride, which rapidlyabsorbs water from the air. The added water weight and zincresidue on the crystal combine to alter the frequency and setoff an alarm before smoke and flames erupt.   Other devices that detect hydrogen chloride gas costseveral thousand dollars each. Among the makers arePyrotronics, Fenwal Inc. and Simplex Time Recorder Co. Mostof these products are used mainly in factories where hydrogenchloride can be released inadvertently.</TEXT></DOC>
