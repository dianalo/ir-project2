(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Williams once contributed to JimBakker's PTL ministry, but on Monday he was just trying to make anhonest buck off it.   The 22-year-old Williams set up his lunch truck, called the``Tummy Taxi,'' in a parking lot next door to the federal courthousewhere Bakker went on trial on conspiracy and fraud charges. Fromthat strategic location, he sold coffee and food to journalists andpassers-by.   ``I thought I would try to get a little bit of my money back,''Williams said. ``I gave money to him regularly right up until heresigned _ even a little after he left.''   Williams said he bought his parents a lifetime partnership, for$1,000, in the PTL ministry and planned to give it to them forChristmas in 1987.   ``But they never got to use it,'' he said. Bakker quit the PTLministry in March 1987 in a sex-and-money scandal. Soon after, theministry went into bankruptcy and later was sold to a Canadiandeveloper.   Williams, who lives in Charlotte, operates the lunch truck and acopy toner recovery business. He said he comes from a Methodistbackground but ``developed the charismatic mindset'' when he went toOral Roberts University in Oklahoma.   He said he knew the Bakkers spent lavishly but wasn't concernedabout it in the years before Bakker resigned.   ``I knew they had a more luxurious lifestyle than any otherminister I knew,'' he said. ``But that really didn't bother me untilI found out how much better it really was. When you're talkingmillions of dollars, that's a different story.''</TEXT></DOC>
