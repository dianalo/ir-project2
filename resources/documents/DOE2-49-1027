Phorbol ester and lipopolysaccharide increased the steady-statelevel of Il-1{beta} mRNA. Glucocorticoids markedly decreased IL-1{beta}mRNA levels by two mechanisms. Transcription of the IL-1 gene was inhibited,as shown by in vitro transcription assays with nuclei isolated from glucocorticoid-treatedcells. Moreover, kinetic analyses and pulse-labeling of mRNAs showedthat glucocorticoids selectively decrease the stability of IL-1{beta}mRNA, without affecting the stability of {beta}-actin and FOS mRNAs.Inhibition of the formation and effects IL-1 is a mechanism by whichglucocorticoids can exert antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.</TEXT></DOC>
