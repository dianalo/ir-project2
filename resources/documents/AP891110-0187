The parties willmeet again next week.   The talks recessed in the midst of discussing the toughestissue, whether the Contras would commit to a timetable fordisbanding as part of a package deal including a cease-fire andamnesty.   ``We are negotiating now our return to Nicaragua in accord withthe Tela agreement, and we are ready to go back once there is ameeting of minds between the Sandinistas and our side,'' saidEnrique Bermudez, the Contra military commander and chiefnegotiator.   The agreeement, signed in Tela, Honduras, by the five CentralAmerican presidents last Aug. 7, calls for disbanding of theContras by Dec. 5.   ``We are negotiating; in that sense it is positive. It isnegative in the sense that we could not achieve a cease-fire. Thereis a war in Nicaragua,'' said Bermudez.   The chief Nicaraguan negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister VictorHugo Tinoco, said, ``I think we were able to find some coincidence(of views), and next week in Washington we are going to continuethose discussions, and we hope we will able to get a soundagreement that will incorporate the demobilization and thecease-fire.''   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said the talks will resumeMonday at the Washington headquarters of the Organization ofAmerican States.   The talks are being jointly mediated by the OAS and the UnitedNations.   Diplomats said privately that the Contra delegation wanted toconfer over the weekend with a new rebel leadership commission thatwas announced this week.   Brandt confirmed the Contras were still discussing the detailsof demobilizing.   Earlier, he said headway was being made on the Sandinistainsistence on an agreement for the Contras to disband, and on rebeldemands for an amnesty and truce.   Bermudez has not rejected the Dec. 5 deadline or the concept ofdemobilization in the Tela accords, which the Contras did not sign,said a source close to the talks, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The leftist Sandinistas and Contras are close to agreement on acease-fire, but the government wants the truce to be part of a pactto disband the Contras, said the source.   Despite tough talk, both sides appeared committed to reachingagreement on ending an 8-year-old war that has cost an estimated12,000 lives.   One new element of uncertainty is whether all Contra fieldcommanders will abide by any agreement reached at the UnitedNations.   This week, a new rebel civilian-military commission wasannounced.   The leader of the new commission, Israel Galeano, said in aletter to Vice President Dan Quayle released Friday, ``It would befoolish to voluntarily hand over our weapons before free electionsare held'' Feb. 25.   The new commission still authorizes Bermudez to negotiate on itsbehalf. The Nicaraguan negotiators recognize the new commission.   When the first direct talks in more than a year began Thursday,the U.S.-backed rebels said they would not disband until theSandinistas granted amnesty and renewed the cease-fire PresidentDaniel Ortega canceled last week.   Government negotiators said Nicaragua would not reinstate thetruce nor grant amnesty until the Contras agreed to demobilize.   The agreement Ortega and the presidents of Costa Rica,Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador signed at Tela requires thatthe Contras be disbanded by Dec. 5 and Nicaragua hold freeelections by Feb. 25.   Asked if an agreement was possible, Bermudez replied: ``Anythingis possible with political will.''   In Managua, government and rebels accused each other Friday oflaunching recent attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
