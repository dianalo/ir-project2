Producing companies have largely been ineffectivein implementing oilfield power technology and cost control due to thewidespread nature of oilfield operations. This paper deals with a verysuccessful power technology enhancement and cost control program employedby Amoco Production Company that has allowed producing operations tocontrol and reduce electric power costs. The power technology availableto producing operators and examined in this paper include cogeneration,electric substations, computer modeling of electric distribution systems,computer automation of power consumption and regulatory intervention.</TEXT></DOC>
