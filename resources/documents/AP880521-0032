At his installation Friday as chancellor of the University ofthe Western Cape, the nation's most militant university, the blackAnglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough Westernsanctions against South Africa.   ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable,non-violent alternative,'' said the prelate, who is the Anglicanspiritual leader for all of southern Africa and winner of the 1984Nobel Peace Prize.   Tutu said he accepted the position of chancellor on behalf ofdetainees, political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of``this vile and obscene system'' of apartheid, the country's racesegregation system under which the black majority has no voice innational affairs.   The prelate returned home Thursday from a month in Europe andthe United States during which he asked for punitive sanctionsagainst this country.   The calls were widely covered here in the news media anddenounced not only by the government but by white and blackmoderates who say sanctions will increase black unemploymentwithout inducing whites to accept reforms.   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tutusaid Friday. ``I want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it canbe done away with without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''   Tutu was greeted by hundreds of cheering students upon hisarrival.   As chancellor at the University of the Western Cape, Tutu willbe the honorary leader of a university that the governmentestablished for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of itssegregated educational system.</TEXT></DOC>
