In a statement Wednesday, the FDIC said it will halt all dealsuntil it is finished taking control of 224 insolvent institutionsover the next month under orders from President Bush. After that, itwill only deal with cases that can be supported by the cash of theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   On Tuesday, FSLIC officials said perhaps three or fourliquidations would be completed this quarter, but rescue deals wouldnot go forward. The FDIC's Wednesday statement confirmed thosecomments, made at a briefing for reporters.   The FDIC typically insures deposits at commercial banks, but wasordered Tuesday by the White House to oversee the ailing Sandamp;Ls untilthe government can decide whether to sell the institutions or closethem and pay off depositors.   Sandamp;L regulators rescued or propped up 223 institutions last year,mostly by issuing promissory notes to investors buying failingthrifts, and by pledging to cover future losses. The deals have beencriticized as more expensive to taxpayers in the long run.   Now, no notes or loss guarantees will be considered. Allinvestors who had been negotiating to buy ailing savings and loansfrom the FSLIC will have to deal with the FDIC, the announcementsaid.   In another development, the president of a quasi-public agencycreated to sell loans and property from failed savings institutionsannounced his resignation.   Gerald P. Carmen, former head of the General ServicesAdministration and a political ally of former President RonaldReagan, resigned effective next month as head of the Federal AssetDisposition Association.   FADA, established in 1985, had been severely criticized forconflicts of interest and mismanagement. In a statement, Carmen saidhe had turned the agency around in his year at the helm.   The agency currently manages about 2,500 assets worth $3.8billion, spokesman Dave Bunton said. He said John Wills, currentlyexecutive vice president, will serve as acting president.   FADA's fate under Bush's Sandamp;L reorganization plan is unclear, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
