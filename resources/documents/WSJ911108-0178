Anderson's Oct. 25 editorial-pagearticle &quot;Zimbabwe Makes Living With Wildlife Pay&quot;: Surely, an&quot;environmental free marketeer&quot; like Mr. Anderson canunderstand that a reopening of the ivory market willstimulate demand, sending a positive message to poachers andillegal traders. You simply cannot expect to save the Africanelephants by killing them.   The initial call for an international ban on ivory camefrom African countries that were losing important resourcesand human lives to poachers. The ban was passed in October1989 by a vote of 76 countries to 11 at the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES). The banwas the last hope after implementation of legal ivory-tradecontrols had failed miserably the previous decade, reducingthe elephant population to its lowest level in history.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Anderson asserts that the international ivory-tradeban has little hope for success. The fact is, the ban isworking. Poaching has declined dramatically over most ofAfrica. Kenya lost only 43 elephants in 1990 compared withthousands the year before the ban. However, poaching has beenincreasing in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi for a very specificreason: these countries have stated their intention to reopentheir ivory markets in contravention to the ban.   Mr. Anderson misinforms the public by stating the ZimbabweCampfire program is an alternative to the ivory-trade ban.The economics of the ivory trade are being distorted.Revenues from ivory represent a tiny fraction of a country'sincome, while large and healthy herds of elephants willinduce tourists to visit and spend more money than ivorysales could hope to generate. Campfire is successful becausemoney has been earned from tourism-related industries -- notfrom ivory trade.   He also misleads by claiming a ban has taken away moneyfrom poor African villagers. This is a cruel and exploitativeassertion, since most villagers have never benefited fromivory revenues.   Mr. Anderson should be made aware that in Zimbabwe, thepeople who stand to gain from renewed trade are the ivorybarons. The reality is that an illegal trading syndicate isstill operating out of Zimbabwe and surrounding countries.The Zimbabwe government has promised, but has failed toinitiate, an investigation into local allegations thatZimbabwean National Parks and National Army personnel havebeen involved in poaching.   The international ban to be debated at the next CITIESmeeting in March 1992 should not be threatened bymisinformation or the attempt by some southern Africancountries to undermine it. With a gestation period of 22months, not one elephant has been conceived and born sincethe ban began in early 1990.   Mr. Anderson preaches a simplistic slogan -- &quot;What iseconomical is also ecological.&quot; But the bitter reality facingwildlife in most of the world is that demand quicklyoutstrips supply, particularly in much of Africa where poorenforcement and economic and political turmoil dictatepractice, not pious platitudes.
