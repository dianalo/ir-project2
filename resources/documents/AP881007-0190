Labor and company negotiators met with federal mediators inWashington for about 30 hours since Wednesday, but could not reachan accord to end the wage dispute. Friday was day 99 of the strike.   Officials at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service saidthey would be in contact with both parties, but no furthernegotiating sessions were set.   Representatives from the sub-building division of GeneralDynamics Corp. said they reoffered their previous proposal, afour-year contract with bonuses and a one-time 3 percent wageincrease.   The Metal Trades Council, an umbrella group representing all thestriking unions, had said it wanted a three-year contract with 4percent raises in at least the second and third years.   In a prepared statement, the company said, ``It appears thatthis unnecessary and illegal strike will continue indefinitely aswill the hiring of permanent replacements.''   The bargaining sessions with the mediation service were thefirst major negotiations since another round of federally mediatedtalks broke off in August without an agreement.   Hopes were high that the strike would be settled this week aspressure mounted on the union.   More than 1,500 of the original 10,000 striking workers havecrossed picket lines and returned to work.   And a key union, the Boilermakers International, told the MetalTrades Council that it wanted the strike settled immediately,fearing the job action may be declared illegal. Electric Boat couldfire striking workers if the strike is found to be illegal.   A National Labor Relations Board official has questioned thestrike's legality because it did not receive a strike notification30 days in advance from the Metal Trades Council as required bylaw. The union sent the notification to the wrong address.   MTC officials have said they believe the strike is legal becausethey notified federal officials orally of the strike plan.   Electric Boat is the Navy's sole producer of the giant Tridentnuclear submarines and competes annually with the Newport News(Va.) Shipbuilding andamp; Drydock Co. for contracts to build thesmaller, SSN-688 fast attack subs.   The company said it needs to hold down labor costs to remaincompetitive for Navy submarine contracts.   Electric Boat, one of New England's largest employers, normallyhas 18,000 workers at the Groton plant and another 6,000 at itsNorth Kingstown, R.I., facility. The Rhode Island workers did notstrike.</TEXT></DOC>
