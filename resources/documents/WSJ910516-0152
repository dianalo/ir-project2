President Bush has nominated Robert Gates to headthe CIA, and the first and only question on that town's mindis how much he knew about the Iran-Contra fiasco. Don't thesepeople have anything better to ask about?   Arizona Democrat Dennis DeConcini wants anothercongressional investigation. He wants to know when Mr. Gates,formerly deputy CIA director, knew &quot;about the funding of theContras and what did he do when he knew it.&quot; Havingdispatched Mr. DeConcini's Keating Sandamp;L case with a merewrist-slap, the Senate Ethics Committee no doubt has time forthe job. Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum says he's &quot;surprisedand disappointed&quot; by Mr. Bush's &quot;controversial choice,&quot; whichhe vows to make even more controversial.</LP><TEXT>   We admit to not knowing how much Mr. Gates knew, andespecially to not caring. Iran-Contra has become a greatplaypen for Congressional Democrats who know they'll neverwin the presidency and want to anklebite Republicans who dowin. The Gates investigation can join the other greatDemocratic campaign themes of the day -- the alleged Reagandeal to free the hostages in the 1980 campaign, and whetherDan Quayle should be vice president. Who says Democrats don'thave an agenda?   Most Americans may prefer to know what Mr. Gates thinksabout the biggest intelligence challenges of the day, such asthe disintegrating Soviet Union. His track record is betterthan most. In an April 1989 speech, Mr. Gates, by then thedeputy national security adviser, argued that &quot;Gorbachevintends improved Soviet economic performance, greaterpolitical vitality at home, and more dynamic diplomacy tomake the U.S.S.R. a more competitive and stronger adversaryin the years ahead.&quot;   Mr. Gates, a Soviet specialist, also said that &quot;our viewof the Soviet Union cannot be based on the personality of oneor another leader, but must be based on the nature of theSoviet system itself.&quot; He predicted enormous difficulties forperestroika, especially since &quot;Gorbachev's Leninism stillmeans the continued political monopoly of the CommunistParty.&quot;   None of this was popular to say amid the Gorbo-mania ofthe time, but two years later he's been proved correct. Mr.Gates's skepticism will also be useful now, when Mr.Gorbachev is grasping for food aid, arms deals, summits andother life preservers from the West.   Last week Mr. Gates gave another speech insisting that theU.S. wants Saddam Hussein out of power. &quot;All possiblesanctions will be maintained until he is gone,&quot; said Mr.Gates. &quot;Any easing of sanctions will be considered only whenthere is a new government.&quot; Senators might ask why this viewdoesn't seem to be shared by State Department and Pentagonofficials who want to cut a deal with Saddam in order to getU.S. troops out of Iraq.   Senators could also ask Mr. Gates how he thinks U.S.intelligence should serve the &quot;new world order.&quot; We hope ithas uses other than monitoring arms-control agreements. Forexample, should the CIA pay attention to a money-launderingforeign bank that disguises its ownership of a U.S. bank? Isit worth knowing about the relationship of that bank with thegovernment of Argentina or the former government of Peru? Ifthe world is truly less bipolar now, then these are importantquestions.   Mr. Gates has long experience in intelligence, and peoplewe respect say he's worked to improve it. He deserves betterthan to be dragged through the Iran-Contra mud again justbecause a few Senators want to spatter George Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
