The violence occurred Monday night, bringing to 36 the number ofpeople killed since Saturday in the Mao-inspired guerrilla group's9-year-old fight to install Marxist rule.   ``The Shining Path is intent on sabotaging all signs of economicactivity and isolating these regions from the rest of the country toexpand its armed fight,'' said a police spokesmen who refused to benamed for security reasons.   Police said three dozen rebels attacked a power generating planton the outskirts of Tingo Maria but were driven away by policeguards in a 30-minute gun battle that left four officers dead.   Another Shining Path column in San Jose de Quero shot dead74-year-old Alfredo Tacza, his son, and a daughter and her husbandafter accusing them during a mock trial of providing supplies tomilitary troops, police said.   Police said the family operated five dry goods stores in San Joseand four other hamlets surrounding the highland capital of Huancayo,125 miles east of the capital Lima.   The government has given the military broad policing andpolitical powers throughout the central highlands andcocaine-producing jungle to resist the Shining Path, whoseinsurgency has claimed more than 12,000 lives.   Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima, is the center ofgovernment anti-drug operations into the nearby Huallaga Valley,where officials estimate 60 percent of the world's cocaine-producingcoca leaf is grown.   Police said the valley's reputation as a lawless no-man's landhas grown since the Shining Path recently began providing protectionto drug traffickers _who smuggle semi-processed cocaine to Colombiafor refining _ in exchange for money to purchase weapons.   In previously reported violence since the weekend, rebels killed11 policemen near Tingo Maria, and 12 campesinos and five others inthe Andes Mountains.</TEXT></DOC>
