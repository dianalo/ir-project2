That's how itgoes.''   Subtropical Florida, a hub for Latin American cargo flights, hasemerged as the nation's center for legitimate exotic animal importfirms, whose inventories range from darting fish to sluggish treesloths.   But demand by high-paying customers tempts some of the companiesto forge inventories and try other schemes to bring in prohibitedanimals as well.   The smugglers, like the parrot ring, try to blend into the legalanimal traffic and hope to escape notice from inspectors, said Quinn.   ``I've seen fake bottoms in crates, fake invoices, boxes markedthey are filled with venomous snakes to try to discourageinspection. People will try just about anything to get these animalsin,'' said Quinn. ``I'm to the point now where nothing shocks me.''   Officials estimate 36 companies and 300 individuals in southernFlorida are licensed by the state to deal in the internationalanimal trade. Many bring in several large shipments of fish, mammalsor reptiles each week, with only a handful of state and federalinspectors to check the contents.   ``We're overwhelmed,'' said Inspector Patrick Hyde of the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service in Miami. ``If we could check all theshipments we would. The sheer volume of the animal traffic is justtoo much.''   Animals imports are regulated by state statutes and other lawssuch as the Lacey Act, which bans interstate transportation of rarespecies.   Internationally, inspectors watch for violations of the8-year-old Covenant on International Trade of Endangered Species, anagreement signed by 120 nations that sets bans on some animals andstrict limits on others.   But the more scarce an animal becomes, the more it's sought bysmugglers. Some exotic birds, such as the black-palmed cockatoo fromSoutheast Asia, fetch up to $25,000 each. A Bengal tiger bringsbetween $10,000 and $15,000.   ``We see a lot of these real expensive animals turn up in thehomes of the drug dealers down here,'' said Quinn. ``Among thedopers, having these animals is a real status symbol.''   Federal drug agents found a small zoo, including two cheetahs anda leopard when they raided the Miami property of an alleged drugtrafficker last summer.   ``Animals are affected by trends, just like fashion,'' saidQuinn. ``One time cobras were popular. Then it was black animals.Then albino animals were hot. It comes in cycles.''   Quinn's single best advantage is surprise. Unannounced, he combsthe warehouses around southern Florida and pokes into cages and fishtanks.   ``It's like going to a casino,'' he said. ``You never know whenyou'll hit the jackpot.''</TEXT></DOC>
