Background </ITAG>FDA has long been concerned about maintaining the quality and therapeuticequivalence of multisource drug products. With the passage of the DrugPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which providesfor the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) process to be extendedto large numbers of generic copies of approved drug products, a controversyregarding the safety and comparable effectiveness of these generic copiesarose. In an effort to provide a forum for all interested persons to expresstheir views on this and other issues relating to the bioequivalence ofsolid oral dosage forms, FDA sponsored a public hearing from September29 to October 1, 1986 (bioequivalence hearing). A major concern expressedat the bioequivalence hearing was the ability of the current adverse drugreaction (ADR) reporting system to detect therapeutic failures of drugproducts. The agency established a Task Force to evaluate the recommendationsmade at the hearing. The Task Force released its report on February 29,1988 (53 FR 6036). The Task Force report recommended that FDA improve agencyprocedures to detect and evaluate reports of drug product therapeutic failurethat could be indicative of product inequivalence. In response to the TaskForce recommendation, FDA established TIACC, a special committee in CDER,to evaluate reports of clinical failure attributed to switching from onebrand of drug product to another that is rated therapeutically equivalentto the first, including reports of no drug effect and reports of toxicity.Drug products considered therapeutically equivalent by FDA are rated AA,AB, AN, AO, AP, or AT in FDA's publication entitled ``Approved Drug Productswith Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations'' (commonly known as the ``OrangeBook''). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. TIACC's Procedures and Responsibilities </ITAG>TIACC is composed of scientific and regulatory staff from four officeswithin CDER: The Office of Drug Standards, the Office of Epidemiology andBiostatistics, the Office of Compliance, and the Office of Research Resources.TIACC conducts the agency's review and evaluation of reports of therapeuticfailure and toxicity of multisource drug products and issues committeereports on its findings. TIACC meets monthly; it may also meet more oftenwhen it has significant reports to review. Below is a brief summary ofhow the units within TIACC monitor and evaluate reports of therapeuticfailure. The Office of Drug Standards chairs the meetings, monitors the literatureand other sources to identify instances of potential therapeutic inequivalence,and has overall responsibility for the committee. It may also evaluatereports regarding bioequivalence and other areas within its expertise.The Office of Epidemiology and Biostatistics monitors ADR's to identifyclusters of reports and reports with documented plasma level data. In addition,the office analyzes quarterly reports of ADR's describing therapeutic failuresor toxicity. The office also collects ADR's from each participating unitof TIACC, evaluates each report, and decides which reports merit furtherinvestigation by TIACC. The Office of Compliance monitors drug product problem reports which aresubmitted under a program designed to encourage reports from practitionersand others regarding product problems that may affect the drug product,including problems with labeling, packaging, and product potency. Thisoffice generally initiates field investigations when TIACC deems it appropriate.The Office of Research Resources monitors the literature for publishedreports of therapeutic failure or toxicity, acts as Executive Secretaryto TIACC, and prepares meeting agendas, minutes, and committee reports.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Availability of Reports</ITAG>TIACC will prepare a written report of its findings and recommendationsfor action for each report of therapeutic failure or toxicity for whichan investigation is conducted. These reports are available to the publicfor review at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) from 9 a.m.to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Requests for copies of the reports maybe obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Submit written requeststo the Freedom of Information Staff, address above. TIACC has placed allthe written reports it has prepared in the public file, including the following:Phenytoin toxicity_dated February 11, 1988; Therapeutic failure of generic Primidone_dated Febraury 29, 1988. Reports drafted in the future will be placed in this public docket underthe docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document forinterested persons to review. The agency does not plan to announce thefiling of each report in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 2, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank E.
