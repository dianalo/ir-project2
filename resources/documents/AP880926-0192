Gen. Henri Namphy and more than 50 of his militarycommanders promised Monday to protect the rights of the poor.   ``We are not only defending the enlisted men, we are speakingfor all the poor people,'' an unidentified soldier was quoted astelling Radio Haiti Inter at army general headquarters in downtownPort-au-Prince.   ``People have the right to demonstrate, to express what's intheir hearts, as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said, addingthat soldiers would guarantee the safety of demonstrators.   Another soldier said the 50 or more superior officers who havebeen ousted by their troops since the Sept. 17 uprising againstNamphy will not be allowed to return to the army.   ``We won't allow it,'' he said, adding that soldiers are stilldemanding the ouster of more officers because of their unpopularityor ties to the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship.   The soldiers were not identified by the radio station.   Members of Namphy's Presidential Guard, led by 27-year-old Sgt.Joseph Heubreux, said they ousted Namphy because they were``sickened'' by his alleged collusion with thugs of the Duvalierregime who massacred 13 parishioners and wounded more than 77others people during a Mass on Sept. 11.   The soldiers appointed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as the newpresident.   Also Monday, soldiers ordered the dismissal of the director ofthe general post office, Jean Malette, after employees went onstrike demanding his ouster. Malette was replaced by Jean-ClaudeJean-Jacques, a managerial level employee.   Employees of state agencies, following the example of Haiti's7,000 soldiers, have ousted the unpopular directors of the stateflour mill, telephone company and water authority.   Jacques Armand Charles, the new state prosecutor, was sworn inMonday at the Palace of Justice, replacing Namphy-appointeeMireille Zamor Pluviose.   Meanwhile, Haiti Inter and Radio Metropole reported Monday thatformer members of the Tonton Macoutes, the private army under theDuvalier regime, killed three peasants who were protesting theirpresence in Verrette, a village 60 miles north of the capital.   The alleged Tonton Macoutes were accompanied by local policeChief Dumarsais Charles, the radio stations reported.   The regime begun by dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier in1957 ended when his son, Jean-Claude, fled into exile in February1986. Namphy took over as head of a three-man junta until LeslieManigat was elected president last January in balloting widelythought to be fraudulent.   Namphy ousted Manigat in a coup last June.</TEXT></DOC>
