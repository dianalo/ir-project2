As lawmakers work to reconcile the bill passed lateWednesday by the House with a Senate-approved version, DuPont is scrambling to anticipate final details of thelandmark legislation.</LP><TEXT>   Thousands of companies will be hit by the new clean-airrequirements, but the anticipated impact on Du Pont, with itsvast array of products, illustrates the proposed law'spervasive nature through the eyes of a single corporation.&quot;From a legislative standpoint, it has probably assignificant an effect on the company as anything else everhas,&quot; says Bruce Karrh, Du Pont's vice president forenvironmental affairs. The company, which once fought a newclean-air law, now says it supports one.   The wide-ranging bill will force factories, power plants,cars, gasoline and eventually many other consumer products tobe less polluting, at a cost to industry and consumers thatthe Bush administration estimates at $21.5 billion a year by2005. Within 15 years, it aims to clean up the smog in allcities except Los Angeles, partly by forcing oil companies todevelop cleaner-burning gasoline. For the first time, itattacks the acid rain widely accused of harming lakes andstreams in New England by forcing coal-fired utilities tosharply reduce emissions. Factories nationwide will have toinstall new anti-pollution equipment to protect people livingand working nearby from dangerous fumes.   Congress and President Bush are largely in agreement onthe clean-air provisions, although the White House isthreatening a veto because of House approval of specialunemployment benefits for workers who lose jobs because ofthe law. The final legislation will be worked out in aHouse-Senate conference.   As the nation's fifth-biggest air polluter, based onfederal reports, Du Pont is a natural target for the public'senvironmental demands. Name nearly any pollution attacked bythe clean-air legislation, and the giant company famous forthe Freon in refrigerators, the Teflon in cookware and thenylon in Stainmaster carpets somehow shares the blame. Eventhough Du Pont is also known as a corporate leader inanti-pollution efforts, the final clean-air law will force aseries of tough requirements that will influence, for betteror worse, the future of its far-flung operations.   At Du Pont's chemicals operations, plant managers arewondering whether some production lines might have to be shutdown because of federal estimates suggesting that their fumespose cancer risks to people nearby. Refiners at its Conocosubsidiary are alarmed at a new, probably very costly recipethat Congress is writing for cleaner gasoline. Still inquestion, too, is whether the law will deter Du Pont's U.S.investment in substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, thechemicals that it sells for use in refrigeration andinsulation and that are widely blamed for destroying theEarth's protective layer of ozone.   How the new law is finally written will go a long way indetermining how Du Pont spends its growingenvironmental-equipment budget, now scheduled to nearlydouble within one year to $500 million in 1991. That spendingcould expand much more in the 1990s, especially to reducetoxic emissions, if some of the two bills' tougher provisionsend up in the law. No fewer than 80 Du Pont chemical plantsfrom Delaware to Texas will fall under the law's mandates.   But the law will reach beyond questions of where toinstall better pollution filters and tighter valves. It willprobably cost jobs, particularly in Du Pont's ConsolidationCoal subsidiary. Consol estimates that acid-rain controls maytrigger the closing of as many as three of its fourhigh-sulfur mines on the Ohio River south of Wheeling, W.Va.,and put up to 1,000 miners out of work in the depressedregion.   Denny Pickens's job dispatching coal movements at Consol'sShoemaker mine may ride on whether the Senate accepts asingle provision in the House bill. Without it, 337 miners,including Mr. Pickens, his brother and most of his friends,could be idled. Mr. Pickens, 38, says he would have to uproothis family from Wheeling to find a new job. &quot;Except forflipping hamburgers at McDonald's, I don't know what I'd doaround here,&quot; he says. &quot;I just think it's a God-awful shame.&quot;   Within the huge scope of Du Pont, whose 1989 sales totaled$35.5 billion, even some of the law's secondary effects willbe significant. Its electrical bill, for example, wouldsurely be inflated by the acid-rain provisions. Du Pont,which consumes about 0.5% of all the electricity generated inthe U.S., isn't offering estimates anymore. But whilestudying somewhat-tougher legislative proposals two yearsago, it calculated that its annual bill would soar by as muchas $40 million.   And because the law will provide for the gradualintroduction of pollution-control measures -- many stillunspecified -- extending into the next century, it willpreoccupy Du Pont for years. Many executives now running thecompany may well be retired before its full effect isunderstood.   Yet for all the hustling the company will have to do, thelaw isn't going to make or break it. &quot;It's very clear that DuPont has anticipated a good deal of what's in the Clean AirAct,&quot; says Paul Kleindorfer, a professor at the University ofPennsylvania's Wharton School who studies pollution-controlissues.   After years of fighting off new clean-air rules, Du Ponthas accepted their political inevitability, even though itstill insists that acid rain isn't a crisis and that itschemical plants aren't poisoning their neighbors. EdgarWoolard, who became Du Pont's chief executive last year, hasbeen preaching within the company that its plants willcontinue to operate only at the pleasure of the public.   Contrary to dire warnings from industry trade groups, DuPont doesn't believe that the legislation will inflict hugejob losses or cost consumers and businesses up to five timesthe government's estimate. The company even anticipatesmaking some financial gains. It expects, for instance, toexpand its own budding environmental-services businessestenfold during the 1990s, to annual sales of $1 billion.   Indeed, the new law is likely to create winners and loserswithin Du Pont.                                                                                                          Chemicals                                                                                                          Du Pont, the largest U.S. chemical company, has at leastfive production lines that could come under scrutiny if thelaw includes a Senate provision that threatens to shut downplants emitting high levels of toxic or cancer-causing fumes.Production lines at three Du Pont plants in Texas and one inLouisiana showed up this year on a controversial list in anEnvironmental Protection Agency study of cancer risksattributed to manufacturing.   The Senate bill could halt production unless the neighborsof industrial plants face no more than a one-in-10,000 riskof getting cancer from emissions. A different approach by theHouse, which Du Pont favors, calls instead for astill-unspecified margin of safety. Risk assessment being animperfect science, the law will provide for further studies,and the outcome could be years off. Yet the chemical industryis already fighting the shutdown prospect especially hard.   An example of how the issue affects Du Pont can be foundat its sprawling Beaumont Works, along the Neches River ineast-central Texas. The plant appeared on the EPA listbecause it emits carbon tetrachloride, a solvent used toproduce Hypalon synthetic rubber. The Hypalon line accountsfor about 100 of the plant's 1,000 jobs and supplies rubberfor use in roofing, pond liners and auto parts.   The Beaumont Works already uses a state-of-the-art carbonfilter to catch the emissions, according to Jeffrey Greif, anengineering specialist at the Texas Air Control Board. Andtwo years ago, the plant began to recycle carbontetrachloride from the filter more often, cutting the chancethat the gas would escape. What more could Du Pont do tocontrol the fumes? &quot;I don't think they could do a lot morewithout making it extremely expensive,&quot; Mr. Greif says.   If the regulatory pressure on the Beaumont Works grows, DuPont will no doubt try to prove the EPA's initial riskassessment wrong. Already, an industrial group including DuPont is trying to make the first actual measurements ofemissions outside the plant. By contrast, the EPA relied oncalculations that ignored conditions specific to that plant.One condition that would favor the Beaumont Works: Theprevailing winds tend to blow fumes away from residences andtoward a swamp.   A broader, more immediate task for Du Pont stems fromprovisions in both the House and Senate bills requiring thatevery production line nationwide install the bestpollution-control technology available. The EPA hopes thattoxic fumes, blamed for at least 2,700 cancer deaths a yearand other health hazards, will be cut 90%.   The tricky part for Du Pont is that it has already begunits own effort to cut total emissions 60% from 1987 levels by1993, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Bycontinuing along its own route, the company may yet exemptcertain plants from adopting EPA-specified controls ifemission reductions are deep enough. But at other plants, itruns the risk of installing new equipment only to find laterthat the EPA requires something else.   &quot;Do we want to proceed&quot; with current plans? asks Du Pontengineer William Walsh, noting the dilemma. &quot;Or do we want tofall back&quot; until the EPA regulations are clear?                                                                                                          Coal                                                                                                          No Du Pont unit is stung harder by clean-air legislationthan Pittsburgh-based Consol, one of the two biggesthigh-sulfur coal producers in the U.S.   Acid-rain provisions will hurt demand for high-sulfurcoal, which makes up 60% of Consol's production. ConsolExecutive Vice President William Karis sees &quot;a highprobability that some part&quot; of 10% of its total output --representing $40 million to $50 million in annual revenue --will be lost as utilities switch to cleaner-burninglow-sulfur coal to reduce emissions. Up to 1,500 coal minersthroughout the company could lose their jobs.   Consol hopes to make up its revenue losses by selling morelow-sulfur coal. But job losses seem inevitable, especiallyalong the Ohio between Moundsville, W.Va., and Clarington,Ohio. Acid-rain controls may force one or perhaps as many asthree of the company's four high-sulfur mines there to close,starting in 1995. &quot;This is the bull's eye as far as acid-rainlegislation is concerned,&quot; Mr. Karis says.   What happens depends on how two area power plants thatburn local coal from Consol's mines decide to cut theirsulfur-dioxide emissions. They can either install expensivescrubbing equipment that lets them burn local coal morecleanly or switch to low-sulfur coal from elsewhere.   The prospects aren't good. Ohio Power Co. currently thinksits Kammer power plant can't be economically retrofitted witha scrubber and will have to switch fuels. Ohio ElectricValley Corp. says the chances are 50-50 that its Kyger Creekplant also will switch.   Consol's problems would hurt the community, which hassteadily lost mining and industrial jobs. &quot;There's a pointwhere people's lives and jobs are much more important thanwhat's going up into the air,&quot; comments John R. Yanen, whoruns the Ford dealership in Moundsville.   In Pittsburgh, Consol executives are planning how to reactto the legislation. Mr. Karis says the company is acquiringmore low-sulfur reserves and plans to double the pace atwhich it develops new low-sulfur mines, at a significantcapital investment.   &quot;I could make an argument that on balance we should do aswell or maybe even better under an acid-rain bill,&quot; Mr. Karissays. But &quot;as it stands today,&quot; says Rafael Villagran, anenergy analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, &quot;Consol is majorloser.&quot; It has been slow in acquiring low-sulfur reserves,analysts say. They add that while companies with largelow-sulfur reserves may grow as much as 30%, Consol will havea hard time just staying even. However, the company has theability &quot;to pull this off if anybody can to make this thing awash,&quot; Mr. Villagran says.                                                                                                          CFCs                                                                                                          Du Pont, which supplies half the chlorofluorocarbons inthe U.S., pledged in 1988 to stop making CFCs by the year2000, the date now set in the House and Senate bills. But thebills also set phaseout deadlines for so-called HCFCs, thechemicals on which the company is relying most heavily as CFCsubstitutes.   So, Du Pont has to rethink where to put the $1 billion ithad planned to spend world-wide on substitutes by the end ofthe decade. Though working on various substitutes, thecompany still favors HCFCs because they retain many of theoperating characteristics of CFCs but only 2% to 10% of theirozone-depleting capacity. Yet it maintains that its customers-- makers of refrigerators, for example -- will be loath toswitch to HCFCs if soon afterward they have to switch -- and,for some refrigerants, redesign equipment -- again.   &quot;If our customers don't want the compound, there's noreason for us to make it,&quot; says Tony Vogelsberg,environmental manager in Du Pont's CFC business.   Some environmental groups say that Du Pont can stillrecoup its investment and that only tight limits on HCFCswill spur industry to seek still-better options. &quot;Thedeadline on HCFCs must be soon enough to keep the engine ofinnovation running,&quot; David Doniger, an attorney for theNatural Resources Defense Council, told a congressionalcommittee earlier this year. The current bills would freezeproduction of most HCFCs in 2015 and ban nearly allproduction in 2030; both dates are more than a decade earlierthan Du Pont had favored.   Mr. Vogelsberg declines to say how Du Pont may change itsspending plans. Even before Congress started debating the newlaw, however, Du Pont was hedging its bets. Its first newcommercial-size HCFC plant to serve the U.S., now underconstruction in Ontario, is designed to make only modestamounts of the chemical initially -- in case a market neverdevelops.                                                                                                          Gasoline                                                                                                          A few months after President Bush unveiled his clean-airproposal with a mandate for fuels cleaner than today'sgasoline, researchers at Conoco's lab at its Ponca City,Okla., refinery were reassigned to a new project:reformulated gasoline. Chemical specialists at other Du Pontlabs also were told to study cleaner-burning auto fuels.   Conoco does little business in the nine smoggiest U.S.cities where a cleaner gasoline would be required under thecongressional proposals. But officials of the Houston-basedcompany expect demand for a cleaner gas to spread. So, italready is exploring what will be needed to reconfigure itsfour U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.   Another oil company, Amoco Corp., estimates that it wouldcost the entire industry $20 billion in capital costs toreconfigure the 188 U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.David Rossiter, Conoco's energypolicy manager, declines toestimate the expense to Conoco but says &quot;it's not one we'regoing to go out of business on.&quot;   Like much of the oil industry, Conoco has big problemswith attempts by both the House and Senate to write aspecific formula for a new gasoline; the industry is expectedto lobby for changes before the bill goes to the president.Nevertheless, Mr. Rossiter says Conoco sees &quot;multiplebusiness opportunities&quot; ahead because of clean-airrequirements, not just for a new fuel at the pumps but inspecialty products such as additives and lubricants. &quot;We haveplenty of incentive to be right on top of this,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
