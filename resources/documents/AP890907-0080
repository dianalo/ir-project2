On a unanimous voice vote, the Senate Appropriationstransportation subcommittee adopted an $11.9 billion spending billfor transportation programs for fiscal 1990 that includes thestrengthened smoking prohibition. The 1990 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.   There was no debate on the smoking provision.   The full Appropriations Committee planned to vote on the billlater in the day. Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,who sponsored the proposal, said he expected to prevail there but toface a tough fight from tobacco-state senators when the legislationreaches the Senate floor next week.   ``We hear rumblings in the woods that the war drums are beingbeaten and we expect a full-dress battle in the future,'' he said.   On Aug. 3, the House adopted legislation that would permanentlyextend the current ban on cigarette smoking on flights of two hoursor less. The existing restriction, enacted two years ago, willotherwise expire next April.   House sponsor Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was blocked from offeringan amendment that would have applied the prohibition to all domesticflights.   The ban on two-hour flights covers four out of five U.S. airlineroutes.   Health groups and airline employee unions have worked for theextended ban, arguing that cigarette smoke inhaled by non-smokerscan cause cancer and other diseases. Cigarette manufacturers insistthat evidence of health problems is inconclusive, and say that theban harms tobacco farmers and others who rely on cigarette sales fortheir livelihoods.   The tobacco lobby has conceded that a permanent extension of theban on two-hour flights is inevitable. They have even signaled thatthey prefer the permanent ban to a temporary one, hoping it wouldeliminate a renewal of debate on the issue every time therestriction expires.</TEXT></DOC>
