That's because some of the hottest items on display at theshow, which starts Thursday in Las Vegas, will be electronicgames and books not much bigger than a wallet.</LP><TEXT>   The craze for handheld entertainment is being fueled bythe stunning success of Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy, a palm-sizeddevice with a tiny screen and game controls. While skepticsinitially cast stones at Game Boy's primitive black-and-whitescreen, customers have snapped up the $90 video game. In1990, its first full year on the market, Japan's Nintendosold 3.5 million Game Boy units, with an estimated 50% goingto people over the age of 15. Another 12 million pieces ofGame Boy software were sold last year, too.   The Game Boy boom shows no signs of fizzling, despiteweakening sales of Nintendo's Entertainment System, the homemodel. &quot;Game Boy was extraordinarily successful&quot; thisChristmas, says James McCurry, chairman of Babbages Inc.,which has 178 U.S. stores. Mr. McCurry said his Dallasconcern saw its Game Boy-related sales rise tenfold inDecember from the year-earlier period.   Now Nintendo's chief video-game rival, Sega EnterprisesLtd. of Japan, a distant second to Nintendo in the U.S.,wants to cash in on a piece of the handheld business, too. Atthe electronics show, Sega's U.S. affiliate will unveil GameGear, which lists at a price much higher than Game Boy, $160,but whose display is crisper -- and in color.   Critics are greeting Game Gear with enthusiasm, but Segawon't start shipping it until April and then only to LosAngeles and New York. It expects nationwide sales by summer,supporting Game Gear with an advertising campaign estimatedat $15 million. Sega also plans to sell a $99 attachment thatturns Game Gear into a portable color television.   Toy industry observers figure Sega is bound to attractsome customers who would otherwise have purchased Game Boy.But the company is releasing only a few software titles withthe product and must overcome resistance to its higher pricetag, says John G. Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton andamp; Co., SanFrancisco.   Playing games isn't the only thing the new batch ofhandheld devices can do. Two companies will unveil the firstgeneral reference books available in handheld form.   SelecTronics Inc. is offering the Random HouseEncyclopedia in a $350 package weighing 12 ounces andcontaining 20,000 entries. Franklin Electronic PublishersInc., Mount Holly, N.J., is rolling out the Concise ColumbiaEncyclopedia in a similar format. Both products cost hundredsof dollars more than their printed one-volume cousins, buteach has the power to search automatically through the entirereference work and flash answers to queries on the screen.   &quot;In the past, the only way you could use an electronicencyclopedia was through a {personal} computer,&quot; says MikeWeiner, chief executive officer of SelecTronics, Pittsford,N.Y. &quot;Now we throw in the computer for free, and it fits inyour pocket.&quot;   The future of electronic books is promising enough thateven makers of Game Boy software are testing the waters. Thisweek, even GameTek Inc., Miami, will unveil a series ofsoftware cartridges that endow Game Boy with a spellingchecker, dictionary, a thesaurus and an organizer. In thefuture, the company expects to introduce encyclopedias,travel guides and foreign-language translators.   Nintendo, which licensed GameTek to produce the software,is &quot;extremely intrigued with the whole concept of educationaladd-ons,&quot; says Peter Main, vice president, marketing, forNintendo's U.S. affiliate. &quot;There's an unbelievableopportunity for this {format} to be used for other things.&quot;   But many are skeptical about the chances of turning GameBoy into a productivity tool, partly because it lacks akeyboard. &quot;Without a keyboard, Game Boy really can't compete&quot;against the new batch of electronic books, said Morton David,Franklin's chief executive officer.   Other developments to watch at the Consumer ElectronicsShow:   -- Blaupunkt, maker of high-end car stereo equipment, willlift the curtain on its first navigation system for drivers.   -- Tandy Corp. and Philips N.V.'s Philips ConsumerElectronics Co. will demonstrate a new way to give audio tapethe sound quality of compact disks. The approach differs fromthat used in digital audio tape recorders currently on themarket and has the advantage of playing both digital andolder analog tape.   -- Sony Corp., which already is making a splash withcordless telephones, will show its first cellular phones.   -- Software Toolworks Inc. will display its Miracle Piano,a keyboard-attachment to the Nintendo Entertainment System,which is designed to teach &quot;absolute beginners&quot; to learn toplay the instrument. Michael Goldstein, chairman of Toys &quot;R&quot;Us Inc., which is carrying the Miracle Piano in two testmarkets, thinks it is &quot;a litmus test&quot; for whether educationaluses of Nintendo will catch on with kids.   -- Explore Technology Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., willdemonstrate a technique for transmitting video programs toviewers in seconds rather than the hours this now usuallytakes. The company says the new technique, called InstantVideo, should enable consumers to quickly access huge videolibraries over standard telephone lines or via satellite orcable.</TEXT></DOC>
