<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0224 </DOCNO><TEXT>The X-ray pulse analyzer for determining the level and profile of blastfurnace charge 'TAIR' is developed. It is based on the time-pulse methodof measurement and it includes a scanning X-ray generator, a primaryconverter, a detector, a data processing and representation unit, a controlunit for scanning. The analyzer is tested at Magnitogorsk integratediron-and-steel works under statical and dynamical conditions. Applicabilityof the X-ray pulse analyzer as an engineering device to control the processand conduction of investigations is shown.</TEXT></DOC>
