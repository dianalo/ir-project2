(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Moral Majority called it quits Thursday,but not before it made history by helping to marshal the religiousright into a political force in the last decade.   After raising $69 million from 6 million people, helping electthree Republican administrations and rallying conservatives behindissues ranging from abortion to pornography, the lobbying groupofficially disbanded a stroke before midnight Thursday, the end ofthe fiscal year.   ``The Moral Majority acted as a catalyst, as an energizer for theconservative movement. It had a major impact on bringing a new voterbloc into the political mainstream,'' said President Jerry Nims.   By Thursday, however, Nims said he was the last employee on thejob. ``I'm standing on the bridge until the gun goes off.''   It was 10 years ago in June that the Rev. Jerry Falwell gatheredreligious leaders from around the country in his office conferenceroom in Lynchburg to discuss how to get conservatives involved inpolitics.   ``It was really a brainstorming meeting,'' Falwell aide MarkDeMoss said Thursday. ``It was Paul Weyrich (president of FreeCongress Foundation in Washington) who actually said in thatmeeting, `I believe there is a moral majority in this country,' andsomebody said, `That's the name.' That's how it all started.''   Falwell, who carried the sword that carved out a permanent placefor the religious right in politics, is now devoting his time to hisexpanding ministry _ Thomas Road Baptist Church _ and LibertyUniversity in Lynchburg.   Falwell resigned as president of Moral Majority in 1987 andannounced two months ago the organization would meet its endThursday. He passed the position to Jerry Nims, an Atlantaentrepreneur who was Falwell's chief executive officer duringFalwell's brief, beleaguered leadership of PTL.   Nims said the plan had been to slowly dismantle the organization,which had a dozen employees in Washington and 20 in Lynchburg whenhe took over, to avoid damaging the conservative movement.   ``My specific job was to wind it down in an orderly fashion so wewouldn't trip going off the stage,'' he said by telephone from hisAtlanta office. The group also wanted to remain intact through theReagan administration and the presidential election, Nims said.   ``We didn't want a major headline right in the middle of a majorbattle battle: `Moral Majority Quits,''' he said.   The last legislative fight ended in December with passage of theChild Protection and Enforcement Act, which Nims said will help getorganized crime out of the pornography industry.   There were several objectives the Moral Majority failed to meet,such as cutting down the federal bureaucracy, increasingpresidential powers and reducing the re-election rate in Congress,Nims said.   But overall it was a smashing success, he said.   ``We are encouraged by the fact that 10 years ago there werevirtually no like-minded organizations,'' DeMoss said. ``Today,there are literally dozens of conservative organizations involved inmoral and social issues, family issues.''   The Moral Majority's work has been taken over by lobbying groupsof religious conservatives such as the American Coalition forTraditional Values, Concerned Women for America, the RutherfordInstitute, the Freedom Council and the American Family Association,Falwell said in June.</TEXT></DOC>
