OPEC oil ministers, who have been meeting since Thursday to seek an output-cutting plan that would boost oil prices to $18 a barrel, delayed yesterday's scheduled Geneva session until today. Iraq's insistence on demanding production parity with Iran, its enemy in the Persian Gulf war, has snagged the talks and stalled a recent rally in prices.    &quot;The longer the meeting drags on, the more skeptical traders become,&quot; Andrew Lebow, oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said. &quot;Until it's clinched, there'll be a lot of nervous traders.&quot;    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for January delivery slipped 26 cents to $16.10 a barrel; the more active February contract closed at $16.39, down 19 cents. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also fell.    Spot prices sagged as well. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was $16.10 a barrel, down 25 cents. And the European benchmark North Sea Brent was quoted in late trading at $15.90, down 30 cents.    Most trading on U.S. futures markets involved sales of contracts to offset those bought earlier, traders and brokers said. &quot;The uncertainty of a firm agreement prompted many traders to get out of their long positions,&quot; said Bill Hinton, oil broker for Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., New York.    Some analysts said further selling may result today from inventory data released by a trade group after the market closed yesterday. The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude oil and distillate stockpiles increased slightly in the week ended last Friday.    Other analysts said the report probably would have little effect on prices, however, because of an offsetting decline in domestic refinery utilization for the week, portending fewer refined products on the market in coming weeks.    In the meantime, until OPEC is able to nail down an accord, oil traders will tend to remain fidgety, brokers said.    &quot;OPEC has got the market on a rope,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant energy director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;Every time they extend the time needed to reach an agreement, the market swings back down.&quot;    Still, many U.S. oil companies, reflecting expectation that OPEC will soon formulate a pact, raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate crude. Sun Co., Koch Oil Co., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Permian Corp. all raised their posted prices $1 yesterday to $15 a barrel.    In other futures markets yesterday:    SUGAR: Futures prices extended Monday's declines. The March contract price briefly dipped below six cents a pound before recovering to finish at 6.04 cents, down 21 points, or hundredths of a cent, for the day. It was the first drop below six cents since early October, one analyst said. Selling pressure continued to be attributed to the smaller-than-expected new U.S. import quota for raw sugar. The quota of slightly over one million tons was down from 1,850,000 tons for the season ended Sept. 30. &quot;The last thing the world market needs is an extra 850,000 tons of sugar,&quot; one analyst said. Sugar not imported into the U.S. is offered for sale on the world market, which is already glutted. Activity in the world market for physical sugar was low yesterday, which worsened the lack of support in futures. Sri Lanka is due to buy 10,000 to 20,000 metric tons of refined sugar Friday for February delivery, and Syria yesterday raised the quantity of refined sugar it is seeking to 30,000 tons from a reported 20,000, for delivery in equal amounts in April through June. In addition, one source said, Iraq might seek 10,000 tons of refined sugar &quot;if it can find the right terms,&quot; and Bangladesh might be in the market on Saturday, but an amount wasn't specified. One analyst said Bangladesh had been scheduled to buy sugar the previous two Saturdays but hadn't done so.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices closed mostly higher, following through on Monday's rebound. A rally on the bond market, spurred by the lack of progress on an oil-production accord, also sparked a stock-index rally, analysts said, and widening premiums lifted stock-index prices. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index contract for March closed at 250.15, up 0.50. Analysts said the approach of Friday's so-called triple witching hour had little effect. &quot;I was looking for it; I just didn't see it,&quot; said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with G.H. Miller andamp; Co., Chicago. &quot;The market is continuing to focus on oil prices and interest rates.&quot; The triple witching hour -- the quarterly expiration of stock-index futures, options and options on individual stocks on the same day -- has roiled the market in the past.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell, primarily on OPEC's inability to solidify a production-cutting pact, traders and analysts said. &quot;Clearly OPEC was the key,&quot; said Frederick Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York. Many traders buy precious metals as an inflation hedge, and oil is a major barometer of inflation. A firmer U.S. dollar, especially against the Swiss franc, also helped depress prices, traders said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery fell $2.30 an ounce to $393.20; December silver prices dropped 12.8 cents to $5.358 an ounce. Aggressive trade selling and a rising stockpile at the Comex sparked the selloff in silver, some traders said. Meanwhile, platinum for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange skidded $6 an ounce to $487.70. Several analysts said that if the oil cartel can soon fashion an agreement to restrain output, gold prices will quickly rise over $400 an ounce. Mr. Demler said February gold contracts, for example, probably would reach $415 if there are indications that OPEC will stick to its quotas. Others, however, are less certain. William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York, said the expected 5% to 7% cut in the cartel's production already has been partly factored into gold prices. &quot;The potential for a drop in prices far outweighs the potential on the upside,&quot; he said. Some analysts said it will take more than a rise in oil prices to start a significant precious-metals rally. &quot;You'll need a broad-based rebound in commodity prices,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious-metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York. &quot;Oil can't do it on its own.&quot;    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices closed higher a day after a favorable seven-state cattle-on-feed report. The report, which the Agriculture Department released Monday, showed a 5% increase in marketings in November, compared with a year earlier. Higher cash wholesale prices and renewed retailer interest in beef also helped firm prices, analysts said. Hog futures closed mixed as pork product prices continued to decline. </TEXT></DOC>
