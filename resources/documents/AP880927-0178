Asked if an announcement of restoration of relations would beforthcoming after the meeting, scheduled for Thursday, Howe smiledand replied: ``Watch this space.''   Secretary of State George Shultz meanwhile said U.S. diplomatshave no plans to meet with Iranian envoys while they are in NewYork during the 43rd U.N. General Assembly.   Britain withdrew its embassy staff from Tehran last year afer anIranian diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain andafter Iranian militants beat a British diplomat in Tehran, theIranian capital.   But British-Iranian relations have thawed recently. London senta British trade officer to Tehran's trade fair this month, andBritish diplomat David Reddaway visited Iran for three weeks inAugust.   Last week, Britain's Foreign Office said other likely topics ofdiscussion between Howe and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati ofIran include the fate of Britons missing in Lebanon and U.N.efforts to end the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping withdepartment policy, said Britain would maintain its policy of notnegotiating for the release of hostages.   The missing Britons include Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite;journalist John McCarthy; and teacher Brian Keenan. All arebelieved held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, although noclaim of responsibility has ever been made for Waite'sdisappearance.   At a news conference in New York, Shultz was asked if Americandiplomats might meet with the Iranians during the General Assembly.   ``There's no plan or nothing that I know of that would bringsuch a meeting about,'' Shultz said.   Shultz said America and Iran carry on dialogue through othernations that take care of their interests in Washington and Tehran,and ``We have messages that come to us from countries that arefriends of both countries almost continuously.   ``We're certainly prepared for direct talks if the setting isright. But as of now, there's no plan,'' Shultz said.</TEXT></DOC>
