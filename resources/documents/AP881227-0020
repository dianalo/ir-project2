Take Paris' venerable Louvre Museum, add a painting by a 17thcentury Spanish master, stir in convicted fortune hunters, shadylawyers and the mysterious death of a wealthy heiress. Voila ... theDe Canson affair.   The case centers around the purchase of Bartoleme EstebanMurillo's stunning portrait, ``The Gentleman of Seville,'' for theLouvre by its head curator of paintings. The curator, PierreRosenberg, was charged last week with dealing in stolen property inconnection with the case.   The intrigue might well have gone unnoticed had suspicion notbeen cast on the Louvre and a host of high-profile lawyers,including Paul Lombard, who is known for handling the estates ofPablo Picasso and Marc Chagall.   Lombard was charged last Wednesday with complicity in falsifyinglegal documents _ also in connection with the case.   The legal document at issue is a will falsified by a former barmanager who stood to inherit paintings worth $50 million fromSuzanne Barou de la Lombardiere de Canson and sold the Murillo tothe Louvre.   The bar manager, Joelle Pesnel, had befriended the wealthyheiress and moved into the widow's home in 1983 as a confidante.   For some time before her 1986 death, Mrs. De Canson was heldprisoner in a locked room, newspapers have reported.   Miss Pesnel was convicted and jailed a year later forsequestering Mrs. De Canson and for failing to help her when she wasin danger. Newspapers have linked the heiress' death to theconditions in which she was kept.   The Louvre had looked into purchasing the Murillo portrait asearly as 1975, and in 1981, Rosenberg picked up where hispredecessors left off, writing to Mrs. De Canson, who owned thepainting. When the museum received no response, the matter wasdropped.   But four years later, Rosenberg learned the painting was to beauctioned by Christie's in London and that it was now the propertyof Miss Pesnel.   The Murillo portrait, however, never went on auction and theLouvre purchased it in 1985 for five million francs (now $833,000)from Miss Pesnel through her attorney, Lombard. France has strictlaws forbidding the export and sale of works of art that the stateis interested in obtaining.   Several years later, during a police probe prompted by Mrs. DeCanson's family members, Miss Pesnel told investigators sheinherited the Murillo and other paintings from her grandmother, whohad received them as a gift from Mrs. De Canson. She produced a willto prove her story.   The investigators found Miss Pesnel's grandmother had died fouryears before Mrs. De Canson and Miss Pesnel met.   Miss Pesnel has since been convicted and imprisoned for theft andfalsifying her grandmother's will. A Toulouse attorney who hadrecovered some art for Mrs. De Canson, Robert Boissonnet, also wasconvicted and sent to jail on the same charges.   The investigating magistrate, Jean-Pierre Bernard, accusedRosenberg of purchasing the painting with the knowledge that it wasillegally acquired.   The Louvre quickly came to its own defense.   Olivier Chevrillon, head of France's national museums, toldreporters at a news conference Dec. 14: ``The Louvre never had, atany time or from any source, any reason to doubt the origin of theMurillo.   ``It often happens that paintings change hands. This one was onthe market and that could have been the case,'' he said.   Chevrillon said the museum had no intention of returning theMurillo to the De Canson family.   ``We cannot be faulted for not verifying ownership because underFrench law, possession of a work of art is considered ownership,''Chevrillon said.</TEXT></DOC>
