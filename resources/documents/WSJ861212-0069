But those being driven to consider leasing should think twice.    Tax overhaul will eliminate deductions for sales tax and interest payments on car loans. As a result, a recent spate of advertisements and newspaper articles has suggested that consumers might be better off leasing than buying, starting next year.    But other provisions of the tax bill are expected to raise the cost of leasing. And some auto makers and finance companies have already concluded that the tax overhaul won't much affect consumer habits. &quot;I don't see any big change in the next year or two in the number of people leasing,&quot; says George Fenner, group vice president for marketing at General Motors Acceptance Corp., the finance subsidiary of General Motors Corp.    Under the overhaul bill, the sales-tax deduction will be eliminated next year. The interest-payment deduction will be phased out: 65% of interest costs will be deductible next year, dropping to 40% in 1988, 20% in 1989 and 10% in 1990. The deduction is eliminated altogether in 1991. These changes will make buying a car more expensive for people who itemize their tax returns. (According to estimates supplied by GMAC, 75% of customers use credit in car purchases, and 30% to 40% of car buyers itemize.)    Consider a $12,000 car, for which a customer puts down $2,000 and takes out a 48month loan for the balance at 10% interest. Assuming 5% sales tax, payments for tax and interest over the life of the loan would total $2,792. Under current law, deducting those payments would save a buyer in the 28% tax bracket $782 in taxes. A taxpayer in the 50% bracket would save $1,396. (Of course, the higher the price of a car, the greater the tax savings.)    According to a study by Merrill Lynch Economics Inc., payments on the $12,000 car will effectively cost the buyer in the 28% bracket 5.3% more in 1988. For the buyer in the 50% bracket, the cost will rise 10.9%.    But the tax overhaul already is making leasing more expensive. Under the new law, companies will lose the investment tax credit, a 6% to 10% credit given for investment in equipment. And leasing companies will have to stretch depreciation write-offs on vehicles over five years, compared with three years at present.    In July, even before the tax bill became law, GM told its dealers that the elimination of the investment tax credit would have &quot;a dramatic impact&quot; on the economics of a leasing company such as GMAC. And the finance unit increased its leasing rates.    Similar action was taken by smaller finance companies like Dynax Corp., a New York concern involved in automotive financing. In July, Dynax raised the monthly rate for a four-year lease on a $12,000 car by 5.3%, to $239 plus tax from $227; its president, too, cited the loss of the investment tax credit.    In a lease, the customer's monthly payments are lower than they would be for the same car bought on credit. But the lessee doesn't own the car, which is returned to the dealer when the lease expires -- normally after four years. (The dealer or leasing company then sells the returned vehicle in the used-car market.) The customer also must pay a per-mile fee if he exceeds an annual mileage limit, usually 15,000.    Leasing makes sense for people who can't or prefer not to make a down payment and don't mind giving up the car when the lease expires. But for those willing and able to make a down payment, owning provides an edge over leasing, even without the tax deductions.    Consider a moderately equipped Pontiac Grand Am that would sell for $11,288. GM calculates that the standard lease on the car would be $229 a month for 48 months, or a total of $10,992. With a 5% tax on the monthly payments, the cost would total $11,542.    If a person were to buy the car with the standard minimum down payment of 13%, or $1,481, and finance the rest at 11% for 48 months, the monthly payments would be $253, or a total of $12,144. Including the down payment and lost interest earnings on that amount, as well as 5% sales tax, the buyer's cost would be $14,840.    But with the loan paid, the buyer would own a car with a value of at least $4,400, according to GM. If the buyer sold the car for that price, his net cost would be $10,440, compared with the lessee's $11,542.    For homeowners, a loophole in the new tax law tilts the balance even more in favor of buying: By funding their purchases through home-equity loans, they can preserve the interest deduction. GMAC's Mr. Fenner says the company plans to offer such loans to prospective car buyers. He adds that GMAC is trying to devise other innovative financing packages to cope with the tax-law changes.    In addition, buyers stand to gain from continuing rebates and low-interest financing programs by auto makers. In the early fall, the leading U.S. auto makers offered some of their most extensive and lowest-rate incentive plans ever to clear 1986-model inventories. And in recent weeks, barely a month after the introduction of 1987 models, the auto makers have begun offering incentives on some new models.    The companies are expected to broaden their incentives next year. On top of the already weak sales climate, dealers and industry analysts say, the new tax law will dampen demand by making both buying and leasing more expensive.    GM is offering a leasing incentive program until year's end on a limited number of cars. For example, the Pontiac Grand Am, which ordinarily would cost $229 a month to lease, is being offered until Dec. 31 at a four-year lease of $189 monthly. Mr. Fenner calls the program &quot;extremely competitive with straight financing.&quot;    Generally, however, incentives aren't aimed at those who lease, and even when they are, lessees &quot;don't get as much of a break,&quot; says Nathan Shulman, a Chevrolet dealer in Hingham, Mass. &quot;As a customer, you are better served to buy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
