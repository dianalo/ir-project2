The platform committee meets onMonday afternoon to vote on adopting the draft as their finalreport.</TEXT><HEAD>Preamble</HEAD><TEXT>   An election is about the future, about change. But it is alsoabout the values we will carry with us as we journey into tomorrowand about continuity with the best from our past.   On the threshold of a new century, we live in a time ofunprecedented technological, social, and cultural development, anda rapidly emerging global economy. This election will bring change.The question is: Will it be change and progress with theRepublicans or change and chaos with the Democrats?   Americans want leadership to direct the forces of change, onAmerica's terms, guided by American values. The next stage of theAmerican experiment will be a new dynamic partnership in whichpeople direct government and government empowers people to solvetheir own problems and to have more choices in their lives.   In 1984, we said, ``From freedom comes opportunity; fromopportunity comes growth; from growth comes progress.''   In 1988, we reaffirm that truth. Freedom works. This is notsloganeering, but a verifiable fact. It has been abundantlydocumented during the Reagan-Bush administration in terms of realjobs and real progress for individuals, families, and communitiesurban and rural. ...   Defending and expanding freedom is our first priority. Duringthe last eight years, the American people joined with theReagan-Bush Administration in advancing the cause of freedom athome and around the world. Our platform reflects George Bush'sbelief that military strength, diplomatic resoluteness, and firmleadership are necessary to keep our country and our allies free.   Republicans know the United States is a nation of communities _churches, neighborhoods, social and charitable organizations,professional groups, unions and private and voluntary organizationsin city, suburb, and countryside. It is we, the people, buildingthe future in freedom. ...   At the very heart of this platform is our belief that thestrength of America is its people: free men and women, with faithin God, working for themselves and their families, believing in theinestimable value of every human being from the very young to thevery old, building and sustaining communities, quietly performingthose ``little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love''that make up the best portion of our lives, defending freedom,proud of their diverse heritages. ...   This is what the American people do, quietly, patiently, withoutheadlines, as a nation of communities, every day. This is thecontinuing American revolution of continuity and change.   This is the American people's true miracle of freedom. It is tothem that we dedicate this platform.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
