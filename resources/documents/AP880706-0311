Dietrich Vogel, an Economics Ministry spokesman, said Wednesdaythat the government plans to more than double its allocation to theaircraft program in 1989 to 524 million marks, or around $291million at current exchange rates.   The Airbus jetliners are manufactured by Airbus Industrie, aEuropean aircraft consortium financed by the governments of WestGermany, France, Britain and Spain.   The subsidy, originally planned at 200 million marks, will coverthe payments guaranteed by the West German government and made bythe state-controlled Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, which holdsthe West German share of the Airbus program.   Vogel said the agreement to increase the Airbus subsidy wasreached at a meeting Tuesday between Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg, Economics Minister Martin Bangemann and otherofficials from the two ministries.   The higher subsidy is expected to be endorsed by the governmentwhen it meets Thursday to finalize its 1989 budget plans, he said.   Vogel said he did not see ``any difficulties'' that could blockthe proposal at the cabinet meeting.   Also on Wednesday, the European Economic Community's executiveCommission proposed in Brussels, Belgium, that the EEC should spend60 million European currency units, or about $68.4 million, onaircraft research.   The funds would cover half of the program's costs over twoyears. The areas of research proposed by the Commission includeaerodynamics, aircraft materials, noise and manufacturingtechnology.</TEXT></DOC>
