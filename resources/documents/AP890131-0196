At the same time, the union expanded its effort to pressurePittston through protests and other actions aimed at the company'sbusiness partners, announcing a boycott of Virginia-based CrestarFinancial Corp. and its banks.   Despite the decision not to strike at midnight Tuesday, unionpresident Richard L. Trumka had harsh words for Pittston managementand said he was ``not overly optimistic'' an agreement would bereached in the next 30 to 60 days, the extension period requested bythe governors of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.   Trumka accused Pittston officials of failing to bargain seriouslyand of trying to break the union.   Pittston thanked the union for its action and, meeting alongstanding UMW request, said its chief executive officer, PaulDouglas, would accept Trumka's invitation for a face-to-facemeeting. UMW officials have sought the meeting because they contendcompany negotiators do not have the power to make concessions.   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom suggested the twosides ask the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service tointervene in the talks and promised the company would ``exert everyeffort to assure that the time during the cooling off period isutilized effectively to achieve a settlement.''   Govs. Gaston Caperton of West Virginia and Wallace Wilkinson ofKentucky hailed the decision to postpone a strike and urged bothsides to reach agreement on a contract. Virginia Gov. GeraldBaliles, through a spokeswoman, expressed similar sentiments.   Trumka said Crestar's decision to give Pittston a loan inDecember 1987 amounted to helping the company build a strike fund.The union's contract expired less than two months later and theminers have been working without a contract since then.   Union action against the bank, Trumka said, began with thewithdrawal of $29.7 million _ $23 million by the Bakery andConfectionary Union and Industry International Pension Fund and $6.7million by the UMW.   Crestar spokesman Neil Cotiaux said the bank regretted the unionaction and considered it to be unfair. ``Crestar has no dispute withunion or its members,'' Cotiaux said in a statement. ``Ourparticipation in the credit arrangement with Pittston is anextension of previous credit arrangements.''   Pittston Coal Group, based in Lebanon, Va., is a subsidiary ofThe Pittston Co. of Greenwich, Conn. Pittson last February refusedto sign a wage agreement the miners union negotiated with othermajor eastern coal producers.   Over the past week, the company has been considering a unionoffer made a week ago in response to an offer Pittston made inNovember. Pension and health benefits are the major sticking pointsin the talks, union officials said.   Pittston has said it planned to operate its mines in the event ofthe strike and possibly would hire permanent replacements.</TEXT></DOC>
