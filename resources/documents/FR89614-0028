App. 1989b), enacts into law the recommendationsof the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians establishedby Congress in 1980 (Pub. L. 96-317). This bipartisan Commission was establishedto review the facts and circumstances surrounding Executive Order Numbered9066, issued February 19, 1942, and the impact of such Executive Orderon American citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry;to review directives of United States military forces requiring the relocation,and in some cases, detention in internment camps of these American citizensand permanent resident aliens, and to recommend appropriate remedies. TheCommission submitted to Congress in February 1983 a unanimous report, <T3>Personal Justice Denied, </T3>which extensively reviewed the historyand circumstances of the decisions to exclude, remove and then to detainJapanese Americans and Japanese resident aliens from the West Coast, aswell as the treatment of the Aleuts during World War II. The final partof the Commission's report, <T3>Personal Justice Denied Part 2: Recommendations, </T3>concluded thatthese events were influenced by racial prejudice, war hysteria, and a failureof political leadership, and recommended remedial action to be taken bythe Congress and the President.On August 10, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil LibertiesAct of 1988 into law. The purposes of the Act are to acknowledge and apologizefor the fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation, and internmentof Japanese Americans and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry,to make restitution, and to fund a public education program to preventthe recurrence of any similar event in the future.Section 105 of the Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 1989b-4, assigned the Attorney Generalthe responsibilities and duties for the restitution provisions. The AttorneyGeneral delegated the responsibilities and duties assigned him by the Actto the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, who, in turn, establishedthe Office of Redress Administration in the Civil Rights Division to carryout the execution of the responsibilities and duties under the Act.The Office of Redress Administration (ORA) is charged with the responsibilitiesof identifying and locating persons eligible under the Act, without requiringany application for payment, within twelve months after the date of enactmentof the Act (August 10, 1988), or within twelve months after the appropriationof funds necessary to complete the identification process. To date no appropriationshave been made. It was estimated by the Commission on Wartime Relocationand Internment of Civilians that approximately 120,000 American citizensand permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry were affected by theexclusion. Of these, an estimated 60,000 individuals survive and are eligiblefor redress payment.In its efforts to identify and locate these individuals, the Office ofRedress Administration has initiated a highly publicized outreach programto the Japanese American communities to encourage those persons thoughtto be eligible to notify the Office with information concerning their eligibilityand current residence. On September 19, 1988, the Office of Redress Administrationannounced the establishment of a toll free telephone number and a U.S.Post Office Box specifically for individuals wishing to ask questions orvolunteer information concerning their eligibility. This announcement alsowas publicized in Japanese American newspapers. The Office has also placedits West Coast staff in San Francisco in order to facilitate its outreachefforts. In addition, the Office has endeavored to establish close workingrelationships with the leaders of Japanese American organizations, as wellas religious groups and senior citizens associations in Japanese Americancommunities to ensure communicating information to all eligible persons.Section 105 of the Act also requires that the Attorney General must notifyeach eligible individual in writing as to a determination of eligibility,and authorize the payment of $20,000, to each eligible individual. TheAct states that payment will be made to eligible persons in the order ofthe date of birth. Therefore, the oldest individual on the date of theenactment of this Act, or, if applicable, that individual's survivors,will receive payments first, until all eligible persons have received paymentin full. For this purpose, the Act specifies that a total of $1,250,000,000is to be placed in the United States Civil Liberties Public Education Fundfrom which payments may be made, and no more than $500,000,000 may be appropriatedin any one year. Therefore, not all payments can be made at one time.This proposed regulation in five subparts implements section 105 of theAct. Subpart A states the Purpose of the regulation and defines key terms;Subpart B lists the categories of individuals determined to be eligibleor ineligible in accordance with the statute; Subpart C establishes a procedurethrough which the Office of Redress Administration will identify and locateall eligible individuals; Subpart D establishes the procedures for payment;and Subpart E establishes an appeals process whereby an individual whois not determined to be eligible by the Redress Administrator may petitionfor a reconsideration of the finding.The purpose of this preamble is to highlight the following key issues raisedby this proposed rule and spcifically encourage public comment on them.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Standards of Eligibility</ITAG>During the period of drafting the proposed regulations, many individualsand organizations in the Japanese American community contacted the CivilRights Division to ask questions and express concern regarding the determinationof eligibility. In response to these concerns the Division published aNotice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 53 FR 41252 (October 20, 1988), inviting thepublic to submit comments during the proposed regulation's drafting periodon three issues that seemed to be of major concern to the public. Theseissues pertained to the eligibility of minors who were relocated to Japanbetween December 7, 1941 and September 2, 1945, persons of Japanese ancestrysent to the United States from other American republics during World WarII as a result of international agreements, and voluntary evacuees whodid not file ``Change of Residence'' cards.In response to this Notice, the Office of Redress Administration receivedone hundred forty-eight comments regarding these and other issues of eligibility,all of which have been placed for public inspection in the public readingroom of the ORA office. Some respondents were United States citizens ofJapanese ancestry who were relocated to Japan without consent as minorsduring the war. These individuals expressed the belief that their constitutionalrights had been violated at the time, and to exclude them now from compensationwould brand them as disloyal Japanese Amreicans. Most other comments concernedthe plight of individuals of Japanese ancestry who were brought to theUnited States from other American countries. Letters from those so interned,and others who were not, generally supported compensation to these persons.Comments regarding voluntary evacuees who did not file ``Change of Residence''cards, provided further evidence that verification of these individualswill need to be done on a case by case basis in order to determine if suchpersons evacuated as a result of government action. Finally, the Officeof Redress Administration received letters from Japanese American WorldWar II veterans whose families had been evacuated. These soldiers wereunable to return to unauthorized zones, and furthermore, were often prohibitedfrom visiting their families in relocation centers. These veterans voicedthe concern that the Act might not include them as eligible. All the commentsreceived during the drafting period have been placed for public inspectionin the public docket record of this proposed regulation.In drafting the implementation regulations, the Division read and consideredeach comment. The decisions that the Office of Redress Administration madein response to these comments were not made on the basis of the numberof commentators addressing any one point but on a thorough considerationof the merits of the points of view expressed in the comments.The first issue of eligibility is concerned with the threshold requirementthat an eligible person must be an individual of ``Japanese ancestry.''Records of the evacuation period indicate that there were approximately80 non-Japanese who were interned with their Japanese American spousesor children. (It is estimated that perhaps 40 such persons are still living.)The Government required these persons to sign a waiver of their rightsas non-excluded individuals in order to accompany spouses or children toassembly centers and relocation camps. These wives, husbands and parentsexecuted WPC Form PM-7, ``Request and Waiver of Non-Excluded Person,''which requested leave to accompany a member of his or her family throughall the stages of evacuation and internment as if they were persons ofJapanese ancestry. In reality these non-Japanese spouses and parents wereconfronted by a horrifying choice. They could either ``elect'' to accompanytheir spouses or children throughout the removal and internment process,or chose to be separated from them. In the event that there was no Japaneseparent or adult relative to accompany the child the Government policy wasto take the part-Japanese child and place him or her in an institutionand later transfer the child to the Children's Center under the supervisionof the War Relocation Authority at Manzanar, California. Obviously, everyhuman instinct would compel these parents to ``elect'' evacuation.Unfortunately, however, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 limits an ``eligibleindividual'' in Section 108(2) specifically to ``any individual of Japaneseancestry.'' Indeed, the focus throughout the Act is on those of Japaneseancestry and the discrimination they suffered based on their race. In lightof the specificity with which Congress has spoken and its focus on theracial discrimination suffered, it must be concluded that the statute authorizesthat compensation may be paid only to those of Japanese ancestry, and notto those who are of non-Japanese ancestry but who were nevertheless interned.While the phrase ``of Japanese ancestry'' in the Civil Liberties Act of1988 cannot be interpreted in the regulation to include non-Japanese familymembers for purposes of compensation, it is undeniable that these individualssuffered the very injury that the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 is designedto redress and compensate, and that they should be compensated. Therefore,the Department will submit legislation to the Congress to amend the CivilLiberties Act of 1988 to render eligible those non-Japanese family memberswho suffered the effects of the government's internment policy by accompanyingtheir spouses or children of Japanese ancestry through the evacuation andinternment process.Other questions regarding internment pertain to the ``place'' of confinement.It is clear from the findings by the Commission on Wartime Relocation orinternment of the Japanese Americans and Japanese resient aliens was nota single uniform action. Indeed, in section 108(2)(B)(i) Congress specificallyincluded language to ensure that the Act covered individuals confined,held in custody, relocated, or otherwise deprived of liberty or propertyas a result of any action taken by the United States or its agents solelyon the basis of Japanese ancestry during the period from December 7, 1941to June 30, 1946. Therefore, in addition to persons deprived of libertyor property solely on the basis of Japanese ancestry in relocation centersunder the supervision of the Wartime Relocation Authority, or in campsunder the authority of the Department of Justice or the U.S. Army, otherswho were similarly deprived of liberty would also be eligible. This categorywould include institutionalized persons who were unable to evacuate fromthe prohibited areas and were placed in the custody of the Wartime RelocationAuthority.In addition, some individuals who were members of the U.S. Armed Forceson or before mandatory evacuation on March 31, 1942, and not dischargedfrom duty by that date, and whose domiciles were in excluded areas, wouldbe determined to be eligible under section 108(2)(B)(i) as persons ``otherwisedeprived of liberty or property'' as a result of the acts enumerated insubsections (I), (II), and (III). The Western Defense Command Public ProclamationNo., 11 dated August 18, 1942, excluded all Japanese citizens and aliensfrom Military Area No. 1 and the California portion of Military Area No.2 without first securing written permission of the Western Defense Command.As a result, there were some soldiers who were unable to re-enter unauthorizedzones and safeguard their property. Such persons, as well as those whoseproperty was confiscated by the government, were ``deprived of property''as a result of the exclusion policy.This issue was raised in the Attorney General Adjudication for the JapaneseAmerican Evacuation Act of 1948. In <T3>Hirotoshi Oda, </T3>1 Adjudications of the Attorney General 361 (No.146-35-16597, November 5, 1954), it was held that persons of Japanese ancestrywho were members of the Armed Forces and sustained property losses as aresult of the exclusion policy were as much entitled to compensation underthe Act as if they had been evacuated to assembly centers and relocationcenters with the other members of their families. Therefore, in light ofthe statutory language of the Act and the given purpose of the Act, suchpersons are deemed eligible for redress.Furthermore, some Japanese American soldiers were ``deprived of liberty''by virtue of the fact that regulations prohibited them from entering relocationcenters to visit their family members or forced Japanese American soldiersto submit to undue restrictions amounting to a deprivation of liberty priorto visiting their families. (This group could also include a small percentageof members of the United States Armed Forces of Japanese ancestry fromHawaii whose families were interned.)Another major issue of eligibility concerns those persons who were notinterned but who evacuated their places of residence during the evacuation,relocation and internment period. The central question in determining eligibilityin all these cases is the same: whether the individuals concenred evacuatedtheir places of residence ``as a result of'' one or other of the statutorilyspecified types of governmental action, see Section 108(2)(B). Thus, ifthe individuals in question were ordered by the military to evacuate anarea, their evaucation was clearly a result of a governmental action. Similarly,if they evacuated in order to avoid internment, their evacuation resultedfrom governmental action. In contrast, if they evacuated voluntarily, notin response to any governmental order, it would seem that they are noteligible.First, there are those individuals who evacuated as a result of specificgovernmental or military directives. President Roosevelt's Executive Order9066, empowering the Secretary of War and the Military Commanders whomhe might designate to prescribe military areas from which ``any and allpersons may be excluded'' was issued on February 19, 1942. However, evenas early as December 7, 1941, agents of the government were taking custodyof enemy aliens, including Japanese. On January 29, 1942, the Departmentof Justice announced the first of a series of zones prohibited to enemyaliens on the West Coast, ordering such persons not to enter or remainin such areas after February 24, 1942. On February 10, 1942, the Departmentof Justice warned all Japanese aliens (of a total Japanese and JapaneseAmerican population of about 3,500) to evacuate Terminal Island, near LosAngeles: that evacuation took place, under orders of the Navy, around February25, 1942. Apart from these early evacuations preceding Executive Order9066, there was at least one later case of evacuations undertaken in responseto a specific military directive. On May 24, 1942, after the issuance ofExecutive Order 9066, but before evacuation from Miliatry Area No. 1 wasrequired by orders of the West Coast Military Commander, persons of Japaneseancestry were ordered to evacuate Bainbridge Island, near Seattle.The statute reaches all these events. Even assuming that none of theseevacuations ``resulted from'' Executive Order 9066, section 108(2)(B)(i)(III)declares evacuees eligible if their relocation resulted from any ``directiveof the Armed Forces of the United States, or other action taken by or onbehalf of the United States or its agents, representatives, officers, oremployees.'' Thus, actions of the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Army,the Navy, or any other federal entity, to exclude, relocate or intern personsof Japanese descent, whether taken pursuant to Executive Order 9066 ornot, create eligibility for these groups of evacuees.Another group of persons involuntarily evacuated who are also determinedin the proposed regulation to be eligible, consists of those who left theirplaces of residence on the West Coast between March 2, 1942, the issuanceof Public Proclamation No. 1, and March 29, 1942, the date on which thePublic Proclamation No. 4 took effect whereby persons of Japanese ancestrywere prohibited from removing from parts of the West Coast area in preparationfor later forced relocation. Section 108(2)(B)(ii) of the Act defines aseligible one who ``was enrolled on the records of the United States Governmentduring the period beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on June 30,1946, as being in a prohibited zone.'' The Conference Report explains thislanguage as a reference to some 4,889 Japanese Americans who left the WestCoast during the so-called ``voluntary'' phase of the government's evacuationprogram, and who filed ``Change of Residence'' cards with the Wartime CivilControl Administration. ``The conferees intend to include individuals whofiled Change of Residence cards during the period between the issuanceof Public Proclamation No. 1, on March 2, 1942 and Public ProclamationNo. 4 on March 27, 1942 as being `enrolled on the records of the U.S. Government.'''While some individuals may have evacuated after March 2, 1942 but not havebeen enrolled on such cards, they may be determined on a case by case basisto be eligible if such persons were directly ordered by the governmentto evacuate. (Clearly, any person of Japanese ancestry who was evacuatedform an excluded zone <T3>after </T3>March 29, 1942 is eligible, since such an evacuation wouldhave been a ``result'' either of Executive Order 9066 or of a militarydirective pursuant to it.)There remain those cases, if any, of evacuations occuring <T3>before </T3>March 2, 1942, but <T3>not </T3>in response to a governmental order directed specificallyat the evacuees. We believe that if there are any such evacuees, they cannotbe considered eligible.In addition, the Office of Redress Administration received questions pertainingto the eligibility of children born to parents after the parents had voluntarilyrelocated. While children born in assembly centers and relocation centersare included as eligible for compensation, the proposed regulation doesnot include as eligible children born after their parents had voluntarilyrelocated from prohibited military zones or from Assembly Centers or RelocationCenters.A unique eligibility issue raised by the public pertains to minors whowere relocated to Japan during the period beginning on December 7, 1941and ending on September 2, 1945. Records indicate that some minors whowere United States citizens were relocated with their families during thisperiod. Indeed, the Division received several letters of comment from suchcitizens recounting their difficulties. However, in implementing section105 of the Act, the Department must follow the clearly restrictive languagein section 108(2) that specifically excludes any individual who duringthe period beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on September 2, 1945,relocated to a country while the United States was at war with that country.Consequently, the exclusionary language of the Act would preclude fromeligibility the minors, as well as adults, who were relocated during theaforementioned time period.The last major eligibility issue pertains to persons of Japanese ancestrywho were sent to the United States from other American countries for restraintand repatriation pursuant to the international commitments of the UnitedStates Government for the security of the United States and its associatedpowers. The plight of these persons is described in the Appendix to PartI of <T3>Personal Justice Denied. </T3>While these individuals were evacuated,relocated or interned similarly to those of Japanese ancestry evacuatedfrom the West Coast, the statute's threshold requirement that an eligibleperson must be a citizen of the United States or a permanent resident alienexcludes most of these persons from redress payment. Records indicate thatthe people who entered the United States under these international agreementswere determined by the Department of Justice to be illegal aliens. As such,they were not lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.Consequently, the restrictive language of the Act pertaining to status,makes such persons ineligible. However, after World War II, some of theLatin American Japanese who were brought to the United States from otherAmerican republics for internment were permitted, under applicable statutes,to apply to the Attorney General of the United States for an adjustmentof their immigration status, and obtained the status of permanent residentalien extending retroactively to the internment period. Such persons wouldmeet the threshold requirement of being permanent resident aliens duringthe evacuation, relocation and internment period and, as such, be eligiblefor compensation. In addition, children born in the United States to theLatin American Japanese during their internment, would, by virtue of theirplace of birth, be United States citizens and therefore meet the thresholdrequirement for eligibility.While this section has endeavored to discuss eligibility issues of publicconcern, andSection;74.3 of the proposed regulation specifically sets forththose categories of individuals who are eligible or ineligible for compensationunder section 105 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Verification Procedures</ITAG>The Act forbids the Government from requiring persons to file claims forredress payments, but states that the Attorney General by using recordsalready in the possession of the United States Government shall locateand identify all eligible persons. However, any eligible person may alsonotify the Attorney General. In addition, the Attorney General may useany facility or resource of any public or nonprofit organization or anyother record document or information that may be made available to theGovernment. Section 74.5 describes the sources that the Government anticipatesusing for identification and location of eligible persons. Both officialand unofficial sources will be compiled in parallel files (andSection; 74.6)that will be compared in order to verify an individual's eligibility. However,in some cases names of eligible individuals might not be listed in thefiles from the official sources and further research will be done by averification analyst. For example, a comparison of information in two filesmight not necessarily identify an individual whose name was inadvertentlynot recorded on a family card at a Relocation Center.All information compiled in these files is subject to the statutory mandatesof the Privacy Act. Therefore, the Civil Rights Division is prohibitedfrom using or releasing this information for purposes other than thosedescribed in the Division's Privacy Act Notice of Records Systems.After an individual is determined to be a potential candidate for redresspayment, the regulation provides for a letter of notification to be sentto the individual to notify him or her of a preliminary finding of eligiblity(andSection;74.7). Enclosed with the letter will be a form and a requestfor proof of identification. The Division has completed draft forms whichare appended to this proposal as Appendix A to Part 74. The forms pursuantto 28 U.S.C. 1746 are unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury. Thepurpose of these forms and the requests for documentation is to verifythe identity of the individuals in order to prevent fraud or duplicationof payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Notification and Payment</ITAG>Upon receipt of a person's unsworn declaration, the Redress Administratorwill make a final determination of eligibility and notify the individualin writing of his finding (andSection;74.8). As required by statute, a persondetermined to be eligible has up to eighteen months after notificationto accept payment. The statute states that a person that accepts paymentwaives all claims against the United States arising from the acts describedin the Act (andSection;74.3(a)(5)). The regulation also incorporates thestatutory requirement that the refusal to accept payment by a person determinedto be eligible must be in writing and such refusal will be final for thatperson and his or her survivors (andSection;74.10).After funds have been appropriated and actual payments are to be made,the regulations provide that the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rightswill certify authorization for payment to the Assistant Attorney Generalfor Justice Management who will give final authorization to the Secretaryof the Treasury (andSection; 74.10). The oldest living eligible persons thathave been identified at the date the notice goes out, or his or her survivors,will receive payment first (andSection; 74.12). In accordance with the statute,the categories of survivors who can receive redress payments are limitedto spouses, children, and parents (andSection; 74.13). The methods for establishingproof of relationship to the deceased eligible person is set forth in andSection;74.14.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Appeal Procedures</ITAG>In order to fairly resolve those cases in which the Administrator makesa determination of ineligibility, the proposed regulation has establishedan appeal process. When an individual is notified in writing by the Administratorof a finding of ineligibility, the letter also shall inform the individualthat he or she may petition for a reconsideration of the determinationof ineligibility to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, orthe official designated by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,and the right to submit documentation in support of his or her eligibility(andSection; 74.15). The procedures for filing a request for reconsiderationare described in andSection; 74.16.Section 74.17 describes the appeal procedure in which the Assistant AttorneyGeneral for Civil Rights, or the official designated to act on his behalf,reviews the determination of the Redress Administrator and any documentationsubmitted by the requester, and then notifies the requester of his or herdecision to reverse or affirm the Redress Administrator's determinationof ineligibility. The decision shall constitute the final action of theDepartment on that appeal.This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291(46 FR 13193, 3 CFR 1981 Comp. p. 127). Moreover, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis has not been prepared under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601-612), because the rule is unlikely to have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 74</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Archives and records, Citizenshipand naturalization, Civil rights, Indemnity payments, Minority groups,Nationality, War claims.For the reasons set forth in the preamble and by the authority vested inme including 28 U.S.C. 509 and 510, Chapter I of Title 28 of the Code ofFederal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:1.
