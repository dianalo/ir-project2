The highlyelongated plasma leads to the possibility of high plasma {beta} and ignitionwith ohmic heating only. To achieve adequate plasma shaping control,ET needs thin blankets with beryllium multiplier. Several attractivethin blanket design options were obtained. The helium-cooled blanketwith lithium as the tritium breeder and beryllium as the neutron multiplierwas selected as the reference design.</TEXT></DOC>
