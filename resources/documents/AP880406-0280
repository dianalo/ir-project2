The measure, drafted by a legislative workgroup, now goes toGov. William Donald Schaefer, who has endorsed the ban as anecessary element in the multi-state effort to protect the bay'senvironment.   The upper house also approved two other bills that would givethe state a greater role in regulating oil and gas exploration andproduction elsewhere in the state.   While there is currently no drilling in the bay, theenvironmental community became alarmed late last year by reportsthat Texaco Inc. and Exxon Corp. would fund additional seismictesting in the bay to locate possible oil or gas deposits.   During an earlier hearing on the bill, Delegate Brian Frosh,D-Montgomery, chief sponsor of all three bills, likened oildrilling in the bay to ``playing Russian roulette.''   `A single spill could set back all of our bay cleanup effortsmany years,'' insisted Frosh. ``The Chesapeake Bay is far tooimportant to our heritage and our future to put at risk in thisfashion.''   At the same hearing, oil industry representatives said they havea good environmental record in off-shore drilling and urgedlawmakers not to thwart the search for new petroleum sources.   ``This country and this state cannot wait until the nextinternational oil crisis arises,'' argued Michael McDonald,director of the Maryland Petroleum Council.   The Schaefer administration also has given tentative backing tothe other two measures approved in the Senate Wednesday. Both billswill be returned to the House for further consideration.   Under HB296, the Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Commission wouldbe given the power to deny any application for drilling rights inso-called critical areas surrounding the bay.   HB296 would require the state Board of Public Works to adoptregulations to govern oil drilling leases in Maryland. The billalso would hold drilling companies liable for any environmentaldamage caused by their activities.</TEXT></DOC>
