Background</ITAG>An NSPS for Portland cement plants was promulgated on December 23, 1971(36 FR 24876) and revised on November 12, 1974 (39 FR 39872). The NSPSestablished emissions limitations for any Portland cement plant that commencedconstruction, modification, or reconstruction after the Agency originallyproposed the NSPS on August 17, 1971 (36 FR 15704). Following its first 4-year review of the NSPS for Portland cement plantsin 1979, the Agency did not revise either the standard or the associatedmonitoring and recordkeeping requirements (44 FR 60761). Four years later,the Agency reviewed the NSPS and the monitoring and recordkeeping requirementsa second time. As a result, although the Agency did not alter the emissionlimits for Portland cement plants, it did propose amendments to the monitoring,recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with the NSPS (September10, 1985; 50 FR 36956).After taking public comments on the proposed amendments, the Agency promulgateda final rule on December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50354). The revisions requiredmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting for all sources subject to theNSPS, i.e., all kilns and clinker coolers that were constructed, modifiedor reconstructed after August 17, 1971. The amendments required that eachowner or operator subject to the standards install, calibrate, maintainand operate a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) within 180 daysof promulgation of the amendments, i.e., by June 12, 1989. On February 10, 1989, the Portland Cement Association, et al., filed anadministrative petition with the Agency requesting reconsideration of thefinal rule or stay of the rule's effective date pending judicial review.Finding that petitioners had failed to meet the criteria for granting anadministrative stay, the Agency denied the request for a stay in a letterdated March 10, 1989. This notice addresses the petition for reconsideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Criteria for Reconsideration </ITAG>Section 307(b)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), limitspetitions for reconsideration in both time and scope. Specifically, itprovides that the Agency shall convene a proceeding to reconsider a ruleif a person raising an objection can demonstrate: (1) That it was impracticalto raise the objection during the comment period, or that the grounds forsuch objection arose after the comment period but within the time specifiedfor judicial review; and (2) that the objection is of central relevanceto the outcome of the rule. An objection is of  central relevance onlyif it provides substantial support for the argument that the standardsshould be revised (see Denial of Petition to Reconsider National AmbientAir Quality Standards for Particulate Matter, December 29, 1988 (53 FR52705, 52706); and Denial of Petition to Revise NSPS for Stationary GasTurbines, December 11, 1980 (45 FR 81653-54), and decisions cited therein).Congress sought to bring about a measure of finality in rulemakings underthe Clean Air Act by requiring interested parties to raise all availableobjections during the rulemaking proceedings or not at all. The only exceptionprovided is for objections based on ``new information'' of the type specifiedin section 307(d)(7)(B) (see id). Even if the petition were evaluated undersection 4(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(e), it wouldnot affect the standard for reconsideration because the criteria for evaluatingsuch petitions under the Administrative Procedure Act are essentially thesame as those for section 307(d)(7)(B) petitions (see Denial of Petitionto Reconsider National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter,December 29, 1988 (53 FR 52705, 52706); and Denial of Petition to ReviseNSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines, December 11, 1980 (45 FR 81653-54)),and decisions cited therein. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion </ITAG>The notice of proposed rulemaking for Portland cement plants clearly indicatedthat the Agency was proposing to impose on existing Portland cement plantsthe COMS requirement and related amendments. The petitioners' argumentthat section 111 precludes the Agency from applying NSPS retroactivelyand that section 114 does not authorize the Agency to apply monitoringrequirements to sources already subject to NSPS were addressed in the finalrule, December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50354, 50360), and in a letter of March10, 1989 denying the petitioners' request for a stay. The Agency explainedthat it had clear legal authority under section 114 to impose the requirementsin question on existing sources. In asserting that compliance costs areexpensive, petitioners are raising an issue that the Agency thoroughlyaddressed in the final rule in response to extensive comments (53 FR 50354,50356-60). Furthermore, the cost estimates submitted during the commentperiod are generally similar to those submitted with the petition ((seee.g., figure of $128,000 for estimated installation costs for one plantsubmitted with petition compared to figures of $125,000-$130,000 submittedduring comment period in a letter from the same company to the CentralDocket Section, (Docket No. A-84-08, Item No. IV-D-6)). To the extent petitionersmake new factual assertions regarding costs, petitioners have made no showingwhy these assertions could not have been raised during the rulemaking andin any event, these assertions do not rise to the level of ``central relevance''to the outcome of the rule. Moreover, the petitioners' arguments that the Agency was unjustified inapplying the rule to the existing Portland cement plants is based on themistaken premise that there were no environmental reasons to impose therequirements. The petitioners' arguments to the contrary are not supportedby new information of central relevance. The petitioners' continuing disagreementwith the Agency's conclusions does not establish grounds for reconsideration.The environmental justifications for the requirements were set forth inboth the proposed and final rule of September 10, 1985 (50 FR 36956, 36961)and December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50353, 50361). Accordingly, petitioners havefailed to present the Agency with new information that warrants reconsiderationof its decision to impose COMS and other requirements on Portland cementplants. Hence, the petition for reconsideration is denied. <ITAG tagnum="84">Docket </ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the material relevantto EPA's review and revision of the promulgated rulemaking. The docketingsystem is intended to allow members of the public and industries involvedto identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process. The contents of the docket, except for interagencyreview materials, serves as the record in case of judicial review ((seeClean Air Act, section 307(d)(7)(A), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(A)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>There are no information collection requirements associated with this action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, the Agency must judge whether a regulatoryaction is ``major,'' and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a regulatoryimpact analysis. This action is not major because it does not change theexisting regulation and, therefore, results in none of the significantadverse economic effects described in the Order. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, Portland cement plants.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
