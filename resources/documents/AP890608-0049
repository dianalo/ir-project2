The plea bargain came six weeks into the complex trial of one ofthe state's biggest white-collar crime cases ever. The agreementalso resulted in the dropping of charges against a sixth defendant.   King County Superior Court Judge Steven Scott last week urgedboth sides to negotiate a plea bargain to reduce time and costs.Without the agreement, lawyers had predicted a trial of at leastthree months, followed by trials in three other counties.   ``We've saved the taxpayers lots of money in court time,'' saidPatrick Sainsbury, chief of the King County prosecutor's frauddivision. ``While you never get everything you want, we'veaccomplished some of our goals.''   The trial was set to resume today for Brian D. Hodgson, 50,former president of the now-defunct Washington King Clam Inc. Hefaces multiple felony charges of stealing at least $1.8 million ofgeoducks, a type of giant clam, by underreporting harvests fromstate clam beds and encouraging divers to go outside legal clammingareas.   Hodgson has blamed any illegal harvesting on divers acting ontheir own and claims he took fewer clams from Puget Sound and HoodCanal than he was entitled to under state leases.   The geoduck, pronounced ``gooey-duck'' after an Indian word for``dig deep,'' weighs as much as 10 pounds and is raised mainly forexport to Japan, where it can fetch $12 a pound. The industry beganin 1970.   Under the agreement, the five defendants pleaded guilty withoutadmitting any wrongdoing, a so-called Alford plea.   The only defendant to be sentenced Wednesday was Roger W. Hondle,42, of Tacoma, who entered a modified guilty plea to misdemeanortheft. He was given 30 days in jail or on work release, put on ayear's probation and fined $500.   Mark E. Pearce, 37, of Olympia, pleaded guilty to felony chargesof conspiracy, theft and trafficking in stolen property.   Richard Myers, 33, of Auburn, pleaded guilty to theft andtrafficking in stolen property; Carol K. Kondo, 58, of Federal Way,and her company, T.C. Foods Inc., pleaded guilty to trafficking instolen property.   Their sentencing was postponed to an unspecified date. Thestiffest recommended sentence was one year in prison, one year ofprobation and $12,500 in fines for Pearce.   Kondo and Pearce could have faced life prison terms had they beenconvicted on the original charges of leading an organized crimeoperation in marketing geoducks.   The agreement also resolved civil proceedings in the case. Kondoagreed to pay $275,000 in civil damages and Myers agreed to forfeithis boat or pay its value in damages. A value was not specified.   Pearce, Myers and Kondo also agreed to stay out of the state'sfishing industry for three years.   Criminal charges against Kondo's daughter, Cindy L. Rommel, 29,of Puyallup, were dismissed, but she was ordered to pay $25,000 indamages.</TEXT></DOC>
