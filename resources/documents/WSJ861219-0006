The estimated futures-trading volume of 101,552 contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange surpassed by 39% the previous record of 73,054, set Monday.    But prices closed well below the day's highs as some traders remain skeptical about the final terms the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be able to reach. Cartel officials postponed a final communique and said they will meet again today for further discussions.    &quot;The only thing that's changed so far is the price,&quot; one trader in New York said.    Crude oil futures prices for January delivery on the New York Merc, after rising to an intraday high of $16.50 a barrel, closed at $16.06, up 20 cents for the day. The more active February contract rose 27 cents, to $16.38 a barrel. Heating oil and gasoline contracts also edged higher.    Spot, or noncontract, prices followed suit. The spot price of the U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, was $16.05 a barrel, up 20 cents. And the January price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European crude blend, rose 10 cents, to $15.75 a barrel.    &quot;Traders are still very nervous,&quot; said Edward Ryan, an oil broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York. Most of the late-day decline stemmed from those traders selling contracts to offset those bought earlier, Mr. Ryan said.    Early in the trading day, prices plunged as traders expressed disappointment that the cartel failed to meet for two days. &quot;Everyone had lost faith,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of energy at Elders Futures Inc., New York. The Merc's January crude oil contract, for example, skidded as low as $15.35 in early trading.    But quotes quickly changed course in midday when the cartel announced that OPEC ministers planned another full session. And soon rumors began flying that an agreement would be reached even without the approval of Iraq, which has demanded the same production quota as Iran, its Persian Gulf war rival. Iraq's insistence has blocked any pact so far.    Some traders and analysts said a majority agreement would suffice. &quot;Twelve out of 13 members is definitely enough&quot; for a meaningful accord, said William Byers, futures research director for Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York.    Yet many analysts are unconvinced. &quot;OPEC's intent is good, but the (Iran-Iraq) conflict has dismantled any positive effect&quot; the agreement would have, said Richard Marose, senior oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., Chicago.    And some traders predicted that even if the cartel reaches an accord today, prices wouldn't rise much above current levels. &quot;A tremendous amount of an agreement has already been factored into the market,&quot; one trader in New York said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Most stock-index futures prices closed lower on relatively light volume, leading some analysts to predict a volatile &quot;triple-witching hour&quot; today that may send the market lower. The triple-witching hour, which occurs once a quarter when stock-index futures, options and individual stock options expire the same day, has roiled the market in the past. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract, the industry's largest, proposed earlier this week to move the expiration of the contract to the start of trading to lessen volatility. The proposal won't affect today's expiration. &quot;The market is likely to be very volatile, and may close down&quot; as a result of the expiration today, said Gerald Walsh, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Courtney Smith, an analyst with Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York agreed, saying, &quot;the expiration is likely to have a moderate to negative impact&quot; on the market. The analysts noted that the open interest in the Sandamp;P 500 future was unusually large heading into the last day of trading for the contract. They said the majority of the futures contracts still held by traders appeared to be involved in arbitrage-related trades in which traders sold the futures and bought the underlying stocks to profit from the price discrepancy between the two. They said these trades are likely to be unwound at expiration, which would depress the market as traders sold the stocks they held as part of their arbitrage positions.    COFFEE: Futures eased in moderate trading. Analysts and trade sources attributed the thinness of trading to a pre-holiday mood. Dealers and merchants said roasters were reflecting on reports from Brazil on its 1987 marketing plans and price terms to U.S. roasters. Trade sources said there also were rumors that Colombia might take steps to lower the price of its coffee. All this caused some uncertainty, which was reflected in futures prices, the sources said.    SUGAR: Futures prices traded in a narrow range and closed slightly higher. One analyst cited a change in market reaction to the Agriculture Department's reduction in 1987 import quotas on raw sugar to slightly over one million tons from 1,850,000 tons this year. Initially the market fell on the announcement, reflecting concern that more sugar would be placed on the world market, he noted. But now, he said, observers are saying that the reduction may trigger long overdue production cuts in producing countries. They cited the Dominican Republic's announcement yesterday that it was closing two sugar mills as a result of the reduced U.S. quotas. Another analyst disagreed. He said the initial reaction was overblown, because a reduction nearly that large had been widely anticipated. &quot;I doubt if it will cause (foreign) output to be reduced,&quot; he said. Separately, the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange of New York announced that a world refined sugar contract has been approved by its board. The contract will be subject to approval by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. An increase in commercial trading of refined sugar and the fact that the price differential beween refined and raw sugar has become &quot;more unpredictable and variable&quot; prompted the creation of the contract, according to Bennett J. Corn, the exchange's president.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain and soybean futures prices closed fractionally lower in extremely thin pre-holiday trading. Good growing conditions in Brazil and lingering concerns about a farm trade spat between the U.S. and the European Community pressured prices moderately. But for the most part, &quot;there wasn't much at all to trade off of,&quot; said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller andamp; Co., Chicago. &quot;It's hard to make a story when there isn't much of a story to be told.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
