This submittal, a revision to North Carolina's plan for visibilityimpairment prevention for Class I areas, satisfies EPA's requirements asset forth in 40 CFR 51.300 through 51.304 and 51.306. These visibilityprovisions were submitted to EPA in order to satisfy the second part ofthe Settlement Agreement with the Environmental Defense Fund, et al., describedat 49 FR 20647 on May 16, 1984. The schedule for submittal and promulgationof these visibility provisions was renegotiated and subsequently extendedby a court order on September 9, 1986. The second part of the settlement agreement required EPA to propose andpromulgate Federal Visibility SIP's, henceforth called Federal ImplementationPlans (FIP's), addressing the general visibility plan provisions includingimplementation control strategies (andSection;51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection;51.302 through 51.307), and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306)for those states whose SIP's EPA had determined to be inadequate with respectto the above provisions (see January 23, 1986, notice of deficiency (51FR 3046) and March 12, 1987, notice proposing FIP's for deficient StateSIP's (52 FR 7803)). However, as provided in the renegotiated settlementagreement, a state could avoid the promulgation of said provisions if theysubmitted a visibility SIP by August 31, 1987. The State of North Carolinadid not submit a plan by August 31, 1987, and as a result EPA promulgatedPart 2 provisions for North Carolina to satisfy the Settlement Agreementon November 24, 1987. The December 15, 1987, State submittal replaces theEPA-promulgated provisions, which are removed. The principal effect ofthe North Carolina visibility plan revision is to assure that the Stateis making and will continue to make progress towards the national goalof ``prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairmentof visibility in mandatory class I Federal areas which impairment resultsfrom manmade air pollution.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates:</T2> This action will become effective on March 20, 1989, unlessnotice is received by February 17, 1989, that someone wishes to submitadverse or critical comments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>addresses:</T2> Written comments on this action should be addressedto Stuart Perry at the EPA Regional Office address listed below.

A discussion of the revision nowfollows. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On December 2, 1980, EPA promulgated visibility regulations at 45 FR 80084,codified at 40 CFR 51.300 et seq. The visibility regulations required thatthe 36 states listed in andSection;51.300(b)(2): (1) Develop a program toassess and remedy visibility impairment from new and existing sources,(2) develop a long-term (10 to 15 years) strategy to assure progress towardthe national goal, (3) develop a visibility monitoring strategy to collectinformation on visibility conditions, and (4) consider any ``integral vistas''(important views of landmarks or panoramas that extend outside of the boundariesof the Class I area and are considered by the Federal Land Managers (FLM's)to be critical to the visitor's enjoyment of the Class I areas) in allaspects of visibility protection. These regulations only address a typeof visibility impairment which can be traced to a single source or smallgroup of sources known as reasonably attributable impairment of ``plumeblight.'' The EPA deferred action on the regulation of widespread homogeneoushaze (referred to as regional haze) and urban plumes due to scientificand technical limitations in visibility monitoring techniques and modelingmethods (see 45 FR 80085 col. 3). In December 1982, environmental groups filed a citizen's suit in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of California allegingthat EPA had failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty under section 110(c)of the Act to promulgate visibility SIP's for the 35 states that had failedto submit SIP's to EPA (<T3>EDF</T3> vs <T3>Gorsuch</T3>, Number C82-6850 RPA). The State of Alaska had submitteda SIP which was approved on July 5, 1983, at 48 FR 30623. The EPA and theplaintiffs negotiated a settlement agreement for the remaining states whichthe court approved by order on April 20, 1984. EPA announced the detailsof the Settlement Agreement at 49 FR 20647 (May 16, 1984). The Settlement Agreement required to EPA to promulgate federal visibilitySIP's henceforth called Federal Implementation Plans (FIP's), on a specifiedschedule for those states that had not submitted visibility SIP revisionsto EPA. Specifically, the first part of the Agreement required EPA to proposeand promulgate FIP's covering the monitoring and new source review (NSR)provisions in 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 provided the states did not submitSIP's by certain dates specified in the Agreement. On April 15, 1985, North Carolina submitted visibility new source reviewregulations (revisions to Rule 15 NCAC 2D.0530 (Prevention of SignificantDeterioration) (PSD)) and visibility nonattainment NSR regulations (revisionsto Rule 15 NCAC 2D.0531 (Sources in Nonattainment Areas)) to EPA for approval.These revisions met the requirments of 40 CFR 51.307(a) and 40 CFR 51.307(b),and EPA subsequently approved them on January 21, 1986 (51 FR 2695). NorthCarolina also submitted a visibility monitoring plan to meet the 40 CFR51.305 requirments. The North Carolina monitoring plan was also approvedin the January 21, 1986, notice (51 FR 2695). The second part of the Settlement Agreement required EPA to determine theadequacy of the SIP's to meet the remaining provisions of the visibilityregulations. These provisions are the general plan provisions, includingimplementation control strategies (andSection;51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection;51.302 through 51.307), and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306).The Settlement Agreement required EPA to propose and promulgate FIP's ona specified schedule to remedy any deficiencies. However, the originaldeadlines for promulgating the FIP's were extended by a court order onSeptember 9, 1986. The order provided that a state could avoid federalpromulgation if they submitted SIP's to address the Part 2 (remaining visibilityprovisions) requirements by August 31, 1987. The State of North Carolinadid not submit a plan by August 31, 1987, and as a result EPA promulgatedPart 2 provisions for North Carolina to satisfy the settlement agreementon November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132). The December 15, 1987, State submittalreplaces the EPA-promulgated provisions, which are removed. The remaining visibility provisions are spelled out in andSection;51.302(c)(General Plan Requirements) and require that the SIP's include: 1. An assessment of visibility impairment and a discussion of how eachelement of the plan relates to the national goal, 2. Emission limitations, or other control measures, representing best availableretrofit technology (BART) for certain sources, 3. Provisions to protect integral vistas identified pursuant to andSection;51.304,4. Provisions to address any existing impairment certified by the FLM,and 5. A long-term (10-15 year) strategy for making progress toward the nationalgoal pursuant to andSection;51.306. On January 23, 1986, at 51 FR 3046, EPA preliminary determined that theSIP's of 32 states (including North Carolina) were deficient with respectto the remaining visibility provisions. In that same notice, based on informationreceived from the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Roosevelt CampobelloInternational Park Commission, 10 Class I areas in 7 states were identifiedas experiencing visibility impairment within the park boundaries whichmay be traceable to specific sources (reasonably attributable impairment(RAI)). However, the DOI stated in its certification of impairment thatthe results from the National Park Service (NPS) visibility monitoringprogram indicate that scenic views are affected by uniform haze at allNPS monitoring locations within the lower 48 states. North Carolina wasnot identified as experiencing RAI. Also, no integral vista has been identifiedfor any Class I area in North Carolina. Since North Carolina's Class Iareas are not experiencing reasonably attributable impairment of visibility,and since no integral vistas have been identified, items 2, 3, and 4 ofthe above list do not apply. The North Carolina plan revolves solely aboutthe State's long-term strategy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Plan Requirements_Long-Term Strategy </ITAG>EPA's regulations require that the long-term strategy be a 10 to 15 yearplan for making reasonable progress towards the national goal. The long-termstrategy must cover any existing impairment that the FLM certified andany integral vista that the FLM's have declared at least six months beforeplan submission. A long-term strategy must be developed which covers eachClass I area within the state and each Class I area in another state thatmay be affected by sources within the state. The strategy must be coordinatdwith existing plans and goals for a Class I area, including those of theFLM's. The strategy must state with reasonable specificity why it is adequatefor making reasonable progress toward the national goal and include provisionsfor the review of the impact of new sources as required by andSection;51.307.The state must consider as a minimum the following six factors in the long-termstrategy: 1. Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs;2. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance;3. Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities;4. Source retirement and replacement schedules;5. Smoke management techniques for agricultural and forestry managementpurposes, including such plans as currently exist within the state forthese purposes; and6. Enforcement of emission limitations and control measures.The SIP must include a statement as to why these factors were or were notaddressed in developing the long-term strategy.The state must commit to periodic review, and revision if appropriate,of the SIP on a schedule not less frequent than every three years. At thetime of the periodic review, a report must be developed in consultationwith the FLM's and submitted to the Administrator and to the public. Thereport must contain an assessment of the following:1. The progress achieved in remedying existing impairment of visibilityin any mandatory Class I federal area;2. The ability of the long-term strategy to prevent future impairment ofvisibility in any mandatory Class I federal area;3. Any change in visibility since the last such report, or in the caseof the first report, since plan approval;4. Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that maybe necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibilitygoal;5. The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedulesset forth in the long-term strategy;6. The impact of any exemption granted under andSection; 51.303; and 7. The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integralvista listed in the plan since the last such report, or, in the case ofthe first report, since plan approval.<ITAG tagnum="85">North Carolina's Plan for Visibility Impairment Prevention Programfor Federal Class I Areas Part 2</ITAG>The North Carolina plan is divided into two parts. Part 1 was submittedwith the April 15, 1985, submittal of North Carolina's visibility PSD andnonattainment NSR regulations and was approved on January 21, 1986 (51FR 2695). Part 2 (submittal date December 15, 1987) was developed in orderto satisfy the remaining visibility provisions identified in 40 CFR 51.302(c)(General Plan Requirements).Part 2 addresses each of the general plan requirements in 40 CFR 51.302(c)as follows:1. Assessment of visibility impairment_North Carolina states that ``Asof yet, no individual sources have been shown to be impairing the visibilityof a Class I area in North Carolina.'' They further state that ``the impairmentto visibility of the Class I areas in North Carolina appears to be theresult of widespread, regional haze from a multitude of sources that impairvisibility in every direction over a large area.''In Part 1, the State identified the five mandatory class I area locatedin the State as follows:1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park2. Joyce Kilmer Slickrock National Wilderness Area3. Linville Gorge National Wilderness Area4. Shining Rock National Wilderness Area5. Swanquarter National Wilderness AreaThe listing was not repeated in Part 2. The State provided in Part 1 thatthe FLM may, at any time, certify to the director that visibility impairmentexists. In Part 1, they also listed the pollutants involved in visibilityimpairment and distinguished between reasonably attributable impairmentand regional haze.2. BART_Since no source or small group of sources in North Carolina havebeen identified as causing impairment of visibility in any designated,mandatory Class I area, North Carolina states that ``Best Available RetrofitTechnology (BART) as required by 40 CFR 51.302 does not apply to any sourcein North Carolina at this time.'' They also provide that ``if a sourcein North Carolina is identified as impacting a Class I area in North Carolinaor in another State, then BART will be required.''3. Integral Vistas_The State specifies that ``although no integral vistashave been declared in North Carolina there are four scenic views associatedwith the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.'' These views are identifiedin the State plan. Since no integral vistas have been identified at thistime by the FLM pursuant to 40 CFR 51.304 for the State of North CarolinaClass I areas, this requirement does not apply to the State of North Carolina.4. Provisions to Address Existing Visibility Impairment_This item neednot be addressed since neither the Division nor the FLM's have identifiedany such impairment that can be reasonably attributed to a specific sourceor small group of sources in North Carolina. However, the NPS has identifiedthat scenic views are affected by uniform haze in all North Carolina ClassI areas. But, North Carolina notes that ``EPA has deferred action on theregulation of uniform haze due to technical limitations; and therefore,it is not being considered in this plan at this time.''5. Long-term (10-15 year) Strategy_The State of North Carolina providesa discussion on each of the six elements required in 40 CFR 51.306(e).These are as follows:a. Emission Reductions Due to Ongoing Programs_The State provides a discussionon the State regulations for the control of existing sources and for thecontrol of new sources. The State provides that its goal is to ``ensure100 percent compliance of sources through its ongoing inspection program,''and that these programs are adequate to meet the national goal.b. Additional Emission Limitations_The State provides a discussion on thepotential effects that an acid rain precursor reduction program (reductionof the quantities of sulfates in the atmosphere) would have on visibility.They feel visibility should improve if some program is enacted.c. Construction Activity_The State provides a discussion of the regulationswhich govern open burning of debris from land clearing and right-of-waymaintenance (Regulation 15 NCAC 2D.0520) and which govern hauling of materialsin vehicles (General Statute 20-116(g)). These regulations provide forthe minimizing of emissions from such operations. The State further providesthat little or no construction activity is occurring around the Class Iareas. Also, they state that ``with the possible exception of burning debrisfrom land clearing, construction activity appears to contribute littleto visibility impairment in Class I areas.''d. Source Retirement and Replacement_The State provides that ``no sourcesnear a Class I area are on approved schedules for retirement or replacement.However, as old sources are replaced or modernized, the quantity of emissionsfor a given unit of production should decline.''e. Smoke Management_The State provides that ``open burning of land foragricultural, wildlife, and forest management practices are to follow managementpractices acceptable to the Environmental Management Commission and, forforest lands, the North Carolina (NC) Division of Forest Resources.'' Theyalso state that when forest land is burned, procedures prescribed for smokemanagement and burning techniques are followed by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture Forest Service and the North Carolina Division of Forest Services.Also, private owners are encouraged to use the North Carolina Divisionof Forest Resources' procedures. They state that ``these requirements areadequate to protect visibility in Class I areas.'' f. Enforceability_The State provides that ``all current regulations andlaws are adequately enforced.''The final portion of North Carolina's long-term strategy involves the State'srequirement to periodically review and revise (as appropriate) not lessfrequent then every three years the long-term strategy, and to preparea report to the Administrator and to the public. The State of North Carolinahas fully met this requirement and will submit the required report to theAdministrator and to the public. The State of North Carolina has met all of the Federal Land Manager coordinationrequirements as required in andSection; 51.302. The State of North Carolinanotified the FLM's for each of the affected Class I areas via correspondencedated March 24, 1986 (draft of plan prior to hearing) and July 2, 1987(copy of plan which was taken to the August 17, 1987, public hearing) (copiesincluded in the appendix to the Part 2 plan). <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>After reviewing North Carolina's plan for visibility impairment preventionfor federal Class I areas, Part 2, EPA finds that the plan satisfies allof the remaining requirements of the visibility regulations specified inthe second part of the settlement agreement. EPA is therefore approvingthe visibility plan submitted by the State of North Carolina on December15, 1987, and removing the visibility provisions promulgated by EPA at40 CFR 52.1782 on November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132). EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective March 20, 1989, unless, within 30 days ofthe date of its publication, notice is received that adverse or criticalcomments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective March20, 1989. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709). The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by March 20, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
