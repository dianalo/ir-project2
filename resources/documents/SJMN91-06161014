That's according to a recent surveyof 1,518 firms by MassMutual Pension Management in Springfield, Mass.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE COMPANY'S 401(K)PLAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Personal FinanceJane Bryant Quinn writes about personal finance from New York.  </MEMO><TEXT>     These retirement plans, technically known as 401(k)s, are now offered bymost large employers and about half of the smaller ones, MassMutual reports.;   And chalk up one more casualty of investment inexperience: Employees arestashing the majority of their 401(k) money in the wrong kinds ofinvestments.;    An estimated 70 percent of 401(k) participants flock tofixed-interest accounts, which currently return something on the order of 7percent to 8 percent.;    But after inflation and income taxes (taxes fall duewhen you take money out of your 401(k) plan), fixed-income investments hardlygrow at all. You'd be lucky to gain 1 percent a year in real purchasing power,which is pretty puny.;    Professional pension-fund managers keep asubstantial portion of their money in stocks, which, over long periods oftime, perform substantially better than fixed-rate investments. The wise401(k) participant should be doing the same, by investing in the stock-owningmutual fund that most plans offer.;    Unfortunately, most workers shy awayfrom this choice. They're scared by the stock market's sudden ups and downs.They don't understand that, over 10 or 20 years, a stock fund will outperforma fixed-income fund by a couple of percentage points a year, says Doug Edwardsof the consulting firm Foster Higgins.;    An even more basic investmentmistake is not to join your 401(k) plan at all. Around 30 percent to 40percent of all eligible workers are not contributing. The young, inparticular, think they can't afford to.;    In my view, you can't afford notto. The 401(k) plan is the best investment deal in America today. First, youget automatic savings -- because a fixed amount of money comes out of yourpaycheck every month. Second, you lower your income-tax bill -- because bothyour contribution and the money it earns are tax deferred. And third, you mayget free money from your employer.;    Around 70 percent of employers matchyour 401(k) contribution, either in cash or with company stock, according tothe survey by MassMutual. You might receive 50 cents or $1 for every $1 youput into the plan, up to a certain percentage of pay. That's an instant 50 to100 percent return on your money! If you need some funds before retirement,most plans will grant you a tax-free loan.;    Your own, maximumtax-deductible contribution is a certain percentage of salary, up to a ceilingof $8,475 this year.;    Two changes in government regulations, probablycoming early next year, may make workers more aware of their 401(k)s.;   (check) Your employer will have to arrange for you to get good informationabout the investments offered by the plan.;    (check) You may be offered awider range of investment vehicles. The government will be encouragingemployers to offer at least three investment choices of varying risks.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Jane Bryant Quinn column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910609  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  545  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 9, 199100161014,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
