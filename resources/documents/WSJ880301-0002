Macy andamp; Co.    Federated's board adjourned late yesterday and directed its Wall Street advisers to study the new bid overnight. In a statement released late last night, the company said Macy bid $73.80 a share for about 80% of Cincinnati-based Federated, or about $5.29 billion, and proposed distributing shares in a Federated-Macy combination for the remainder. The shares would be equal to about 40% of the new firm's equity. The total bid would thus have a &quot;blended value&quot; based in part on the price placed on the new shares.    The board now plans to reconvene today to study both the Macy bid and the latest bid from Campeau Corp. The Toronto-based retailer appeared over the weekend to have sewn up its quest for control of Federated when the company tentatively agreed to its $6.02 billion, or $68-a-share, offer for all of Federated. The Macy bid is a severe blow to Campeau, which had hoped to complete a definitive merger agreement with Federated yesterday.    &quot;The board hasn't accepted either offer,&quot; said a source close to the transaction last night. &quot;What they're doing is negotiating both deals to the last detail and then deciding which one they want to take.&quot; Negotiators from all camps were in talks late last night.    In the statement, Federated said Macy proposed to call the new firm Macy/Federated Inc. and have its shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It said Federated executives would get &quot;significant representation&quot; on the new concern's board.    Macy's Wall Street advisers, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder Peabody, presented Federated with letters saying they are &quot;highly confident&quot; they can arrange $1.8 billion in subordinated debt financing for the deal as well as a $1.8 billion interim &quot;bridge&quot; loan if necessary. Federated said Bankers Trust Co. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said they were confident they could arrange additional financing.    Macy declined to comment yesterday.    A merger with Macy, which is roughly half the size of Federated, could be attractive to the larger retailer's executives. Macy's smaller size could leave Federated's officers with operating power in a combined concern. And feelings at Federated have run high against Campeau, which surprised the company with a hostile bid last month. However, Campeau's bid is all cash and the Macy bid isn't.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Federated shares jumped $2 to $66.50, on volume of about 1.6 million shares.    The appearance of the Macy bid derailed Campeau's hopes for a quick wrapup of the transaction and threw the Canadian concern's camp into disarray. Negotiations between Federated and Campeau had continued over the weekend, and sources close to the talks said only minor details remained to be settled.    Wall Street sources said Macy decided over the weekend to make its own bid for Federated, whose Bloomingdale's chain has long competed with Macy for leadership in New York City retailing.    Macy executives feel a Macy-Federated combination &quot;would be a match made in heaven,&quot; said one Wall Street source. &quot;The combination of these two companies would be an unbelievable entity. It would be the pre-eminent retailer in the United States.&quot;    Macy, one of the country's largest retailers with 91 department stores, posted 1987 sales of $5.21 billion and pretax profit of $59.6 million. Federated, for the most recent nine months reported, had sales of more than $7 billion and is the nation's largest retailer with more than 650 stores. </TEXT></DOC>
