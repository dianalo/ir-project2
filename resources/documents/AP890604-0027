The judges, whose current salaries range from $89,500 to$115,000 a year, are now pressing Congress for a 30 percent salaryincrease.   ``I think judges are entitled to a pay raise,'' said RobertMcWilliams of the U.S. 10th Circuit Court in Colorado. ``They areworth it. Judges' salaries, rather than being geared to the incomeof the average taxpayer, should be geared to the average ofpracticing lawyers.''   An Associated Press survey of 935 financial disclosure reportsfound that few federal jurists depend solely on their salaries. Allbut 15 of the judges had outside income _ with more than half thejudges reporting extra earnings in a range from $16,624 to $39,500.   For its study, AP examined reports for 1987, the most recentyear for which a complete set was available. Most material in thesereports is listed within wide numerical ranges rather than in exactdollar amounts.   Like other Americans with personal assets, the judges receiveinvestment income through interest, dividends, rent on real estate,and capital gains on land or securities. Four hundred judgesreported extra earned income _ some through teaching law, speakingfees or book royalties, but mostly through pensions from earlierjobs or settlements from their former law firms.   ``If I didn't have some farm and timberland that my father leftme, I doubt if I would be so sure that I will spend the rest of mycareer on the bench,'' Judge Duross Fitzpatrick said in a letterused to support the proposal for a 51 percent pay increase that wasdefeated by Congress in February.   According to his disclosure report, Fitzpatrick's outside incomemay have exceeded his $89,500 salary. The Macon, Ga., juristreported net investment assets between $472,388 and $865,379 andsaid he collected between $75,510 and $165,100 in outside income in1987.   For 10 years, financial disclosure forms have been required offederal officials, focusing considerable attention on Congress andthe Cabinet. The judges, in contrast, have received less scrutiny.   Some details from the judicial disclosures:   _Only five judges reported no household income other thansalaries.   _At least 555 judges, perhaps as many as 723, have investmentassets worth more than $100,000 after their debts have beensubtracted. The typical judge reported net investments worthbetween $140,000 and $350,000. These assets generally reflectfamily funds or substantial incomes before and after appointment tothe bench.   _At least 62, and as many as 176, of the judges aremillionaires. They include Gerhard Gesell, who presided over thetrial of Oliver North and whose holdings include stock and a358-acre Virginia farm. Sandra Day O'Connor appears to be the onlymillionaire on the Supreme Court.   _Many of the judges (at least 93 and perhaps as many as 258)have more money coming in from outside sources than they get fromtheir government salaries.   Judicial leaders, right up to Chief Justice William Rehnquist,say the judges are underpaid, and their salaries indeed lag behindAmerica's top corporate attorneys. Yet in comparison to mostAmericans, or even to most American attorneys, the judges findthemselves in comfortable circumstances.   The median U.S. wage and salary earner was paid $14,733 in 1987;at least 507 of the judges made more than that off the bench. Amedian means half are above that figure and half are below.   To look at the point raised by McWilliams, median income for allof America's 707,000 lawyers and judges was $45,069, according toCensus reports. At least 207 (and as many as 426) of the federaljudges made more than that outside the courtroom.   The disclosure reports put the median 1987 income for a federaljudge at between $108,018 and $130,300.   Myron Bright, a semiretired appeals judge in Fargo, N.D.,receives a $95,000 judicial salary and made more than $43,530 fromteaching and speaking in 1987. His total income was more than thecombined salaries of North Dakota's chief justice and attorneygeneral.   Personal finance isn't the lure for many of the attorneys whoaccept a lifetime appointment as judge. ``On an actual incomebasis, I think I'm making less than I did when I first got on thebench,'' said the 70-year-old Bright. ``But I'm not complaining.''   ``Being a federal judge is like getting the brass ring on amerry-go-round,'' said Avern Cohn of Michigan, a one-time prominentlawyer who is among the wealthiest judges in the country. ``I waslooking for other ways to prove myself professionally.''   America's most impoverished judge is Alcee Hastings of Miami,who is now fighting a perjury impeachment by Congress. Hastings hadlegal bills between $450,000 and $1 million in 1987 and reported hewas at least $699,005 in the red.   More representative of judges who report themselves in debt isThomas McAvoy of Binghamton, N.Y., who reported debts that exceedhis assets by $83,797 to $194,500. The bulk of McAvoy's holdingsare in mortgaged real estate.   Richard Cudahy of Chicago, scion of a Milwaukee meatpackingfamily, may be the wealthiest judge. The 63-year-old appellatejurist is worth between $8.4 million and $16.1 million.   Overall, the financial reports do not give a complete look atthe judges' wealth because they do not include their homes andholdings not held for investment purposes. Also, judges can valueproperty at the purchase price, sometimes decades out of date.   In addition, the AP understated the wealth by not countingassets and income of spouses and dependent children except wherespecifically noted.   Earlier this year, Congress balked at a 51 percent raiseproposed for judges, Congress and some executives. Chief JusticeRehnquist then held a rare news conference to appeal for raises toavert what he called ``the most serious threat to the future of thejudiciary.'' Rehnquist reports the net value of his investmentsbetween $71,000 and $230,000.   President Bush responded by proposing 25 percent increases forthe judges with some limits on outside income. The judges areasking for 30 percent with annual cost-of-living adjustments and nolimits.   The judges say an inflation-driven financial squeeze will forcemany of them from the bench and into higher-paying jobs at lawfirms. This assumes they in fact would land the relatively rarehigher paying jobs.   A survey by The American Lawyer magazine found that 1987 profitsper partner in the 100 firms with the most revenue ranged from$155,000 to $1.4 million. Their 10,098 partners _ concentratedprimarily in a handful of big cities _ represent 1.5 percent of allthe lawyers in America.</TEXT></DOC>
