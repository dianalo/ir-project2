Thiswill help expedite the obtaining of records for use in a variety of Serviceproceedings such as deportation, exclusion and recission. The Service isattempting to accelerate the obtaining of records to quicken the removalof criminal aliens who are citizens or nationals of Canada. This in manyinstances will save the Service detention costs while awaiting the receiptof documents authenticated in accordance with 8 CFR 287.6(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received no later than October 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments, in triplicate, to Director,Policy Directives and Instructions, Immigration and Naturalization Service,Room 2011, 425 I Street NW., Washington, DC 20536.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ira L.

This is particularly importantto the Service when seeking to obtain criminal convictions. Presently,records are requested by an immigration officer through an INS districtoffice closest to the location where the records are located. When therecords are received by that office, it is sent to the appropriate Americanconsulate for authentication. It is then returned to INS to be forwardedto the officer originally requesting the record. By eliminating the authentication,one time consuming step is removed. It is deemed that the record keepingsystem of the Canadian governmental records are comparable to our own andthat authentication by an American consulate is an unnecessary step inthe process. Shortening the time to obtain records can conserve resourcesby reducing the time and expense necessary to detain Canadian citizensand nationals facing explusion from the United States because of theirhistory of criminal conduct. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This is not a major rule within the meaning of section1(b) of E.O. 12992, nor does this rule have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 287 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Subpoenas, Deportation.Accordingly, part 287 of chapter I of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 287_FIELD OFFICERS; POWERS AND DUTIES </ITAG>1.
