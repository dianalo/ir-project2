Rust remains free on his own recognizance until then.;    &quot;Theaccused is, indeed, a weird man,&quot; said presiding Judge Juergen Schenck,agreeing that Rust had diminished mental capacity at the time of the attack.;   Wolfgang Walura, the victim's father, said that his daughter still sufferedphysically and psychologically from the attack, which Rust's lawyer concededwould have killed her had it not happened in a hospital. Stefanie Walura, whohas filed a civil suit against Rust, told the court that the attack has causedher to become claustrophobic.;    The three-judge panel concluded thatStefanie Walura must have said or done something to provoke Rust on Nov. 23,1989.
