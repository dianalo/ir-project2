<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0535 </DOCNO><TEXT>A multivariate analysis on 1195 patients with operable breast cancer andhistologically positive axillary nodes treated by mastectomy and completeaxillary dissection at the Institut Gustave-Roussy between 1958 and 1978suggests a beneficial effect of treatment of the internal mammary chain(IMC) on the risks of death and distant metastasis for the patients withmedial tumors. For these patients, surgical IMC dissection and post-operativeirradiation have similar effects on both the risk of death and of distantmetastasis. For the patients with lateral tumors, no beneficial effectof the treatment of the IMC on these two risks was observed. Postoperativeirradiation to the IMC, axilla, chest wall and supraclavicular nodessignificantly decreases the risk of locoregional recurrences independentof the tumor site and surgical management of the lymph nodes. 27 refs.;3 figs.; 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
