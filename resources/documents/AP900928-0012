As Germany mergespeacefully, he takes on renewed importance for a generation seekingto draw lessons from the past.   Tens of thousands of Germans, including political leaders, haveflocked to a major exhibit in West Berlin attempting to analyzeBismarck and the consequences of his policies for Germany and forEurope.   The German Historical Museum's exhibit, ``Bismarck - Prussia,Germany, and Europe'' was planned three years ago, when thequestion of unity seemed a distant dream to most Germans.   ``Nobody could have known three years ago how current theBismarck topic would be by the summer of 1990,'' says ChristophStoelzl, director of the German Historical Museum.   The impact of German unity next Wednesday has preoccupiedtoday's politicians, diplomats, financiers and historians much asit did when Bismarck united the country the first time in 1871.   Some Europeans have expressed concern the new Germany will betoo big and too powerful, and more interested in itself than inEuropean unity. Again, there is a parallel to the Bismarck era,because those same problems developed after 1871.   ``It is important to think about what the concept of nationhoodmeans because of what is happening in Germany, but also in theframework of European unity,'' said Bernard Falge, director of theFrench Intitute in West Berlin. The institute has set up twoacademic conferences on the topic.   The Bismarck exhibit has already attracted leading politicianssince it opened Aug. 26. West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker, Social Democratic chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel and hisEast German counterpart, Wolfgang Thierse, are among more than50,000 people who have seen it. The exhibit runs until Nov. 25.   It is hard to ignore Bismarck in Germany. Many towns have aBismarck street. There have been Bismarck submarines and ships.There are hundreds of books devoted to the statesman known as the``Iron Chancellor.''   Nearly 300 institutions in more than a dozen countries lentpaintings, sculptures, letters, books, uniforms, maps and otheritems to form the biggest collection of objects connected withBismarck ever assembled.   ``It is rather overwhelming to go see so many things from thattime,'' said Manfred Jehle, a researcher at the HistoricalCommission in West Berlin, after he saw the exhibit for the firsttime.   The first part of the exhibit concentrates on the powerfulregion of Prussia, named for an exterminated pagan tribe. Bismarck,a native Prussian, set German unity as one of his major goals whenhe became prime minister of Prussia in 1862.   But he looked down on a peaceful way to uniting Germany'sprincipalities, duchies, kingdoms, and states, which wereconstantly being overrun by the French or the Austrians because oftheir lack of unity.   ``The great questions of the time will not be decided byspeeches and majority decisions, but through iron and blood,''Bismarck said in one of his most famous speeches in 1862.   The exhibit follows through Prussian battles in the 1860s to theFranco-Prussian war and the 1871 proclamation of a constitutionalmonarchy - and a unified Germany.   This time, Germans are unifying after four decades of livingwith the legacy of the country's Nazi past. And in contrast toBismarck, current Chancellor Helmut Kohl got what he wanted inlarge part through skillful and patient diplomacy.   This time, the united Germany will combine the 11 West Germanstates with five new states being reorganized in East Germany. Muchof Bismarck's Prussia now lies in the Soviet Union and Polandfollowing Nazi Germany's loss in World War II.   The exhibit also focuses on Bismarck's policy toward Europe,which was based on isolating France and building up an armypowerful enough to defeat the enemy. Several of Bismarck's spikedhelmets form part of an extensive display of German military dress.   His strategy drove Europe apart and led to the glorification ofthe military, which continued through the world wars that defeatedand then divided Germany.   Kohl, however, espouses West Germany's postwar pro-Europeanpolicies and is committed to European unification. Kohl, the nextchancellor of a unified Germany, has promised to maintain thatpolicy rather than take Bismarck's militaristic path.</TEXT></DOC>
