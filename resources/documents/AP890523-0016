The White House on Monday took the unusual step of issuing astatement encouraging intervention by central government banks todrive down the dollar's value abroad.   The step was taken in conjunction with a sell-off of dollars bythe Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and several European centralbanks.   The decision to issue a statement was propelled byadministration fears that too high a rise in the dollar againstother major currencies will erase hard-won recent improvements inthe U.S. trade deficit.   The deficit, aided by record export sales, fell dramatically to$8.86 billion in March, a 9.8 percent drop from February'simbalance of $9.82 billion, according to the Commerce Department.The drop continued a downward trend in the trade deficit thatstarted early last year.   As the dollar goes higher against other major currencies,imported goods become less expensive here and prices of U.S.products go up abroad, aggravating the trade deficit.   Despite the selling of dollars by central banks, the dollar hascontinued to climb, surging to more than 2 West German marks and to140 Japanese yen, the upper limits of trading ranges unofficiallyset by the seven major industrial nations.   A reason for the dollar's unrestrained climb is that politicalproblems faced by ruling administrations in both Japan and WestGermany are undermining trader confidence in the yen and the mark,enhancing the attractiveness of the dollar.   In Japan, the announcement by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshitathat he would resign to take responsibility in the payoff scandalthat has rocked Japan is causing investor unrest, analysts said.The governing party's search for a successor has been complicatedby the scandal's links to most of its senior members.   And in West Germany, the current dispute over nucleardisarmament is causing problems for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Although his advocacy of early U.S.-Soviet talks on eliminatingNATO's short-range nuclear missiles is posing a problem for theUnited States in the upcoming NATO summit, Kohl is under even morepolitical pressure at home to take a stronger stand against themissiles.   ``Financial markets are getting nervous that Kohl is going tolose the election. And in Japan, we still don't know who the newprime minister will be,'' said David Wyss, chief financialeconomist for Data Resources Inc.   ``This makes people holding onto yen or marks very nervous, sothey buy dollars. And the interest rate on dollars(dollar-denominated investments and securities) is still very highcompared to those in Germany and Japan,'' Wyss continued.   Monday's White House statement by deputy press secretary RomanPopadiuk said the climbing dollar ``is a matter of concern'' that``has also prompted questioning of the administration's commitmentto the process of economic policy coordination'' among the Group ofSeven major industrial democracies.   They are the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada. The seven have agreed to take steps tocoordinate their economic policies _ including interest ratechanges and direct intervention on exchange markets _ to keep majorcurrencies stable.   ``This administration remains fully committed to this process,''the White House statement continued.   ``If the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies issustained for a prolonged period, or extended, it could undermineinternational efforts to reduce global trade imbalances,'' thestatement said.   Since the White House usually does not make such comments, thestatement appeared to be designed largely for its psychologicalimpact on traders, analysts suggested.   ``The dollar is getting out of hand, so they (the government)had to do something. But they're going to have to back it up withaction, to spend billions to move dollars around,'' said Michael K.Evans, who heads a private Washington-based economic consultingfirm.   Despite the White House plea and repeated central-bank selling,however, the dollar surged anew on Monday, hitting a new 2{-yearhigh against the mark and a 1{-year high against the yen.   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in aninterview in Monday's editions of the Milwaukee Journal that worldunrest was a major factor in the dollar's rise because it wasperceived as a safe investment haven.   ``You have a million Chinese rioting in the streets,'' he said.``You have NATO in an unsettled state of affairs. You have, inJapan, lack of clear definition of leadership really for the firsttime since the second World War. So it doesn't surprise me thatpeople pause for a moment and want to put their money in a countrywhere the people have settled their leadership question,'' Bradysaid.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
