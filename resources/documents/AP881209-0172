The countdown at the space center on the Atlantic coast of FrenchGuiana was halted just six minutes before the planned liftoff at9:01 p.m. (7:01 p.m. EST) to let a threatening storm cloud pass by.   It was resumed 20 minutes later, only to be stopped automaticallywhen there was a failure in the computerized link with the trackingstation on Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean, ArianespacePresident Frederic d'Allest said.   He said the liftoff was postponed until the second planned launchwindow, from 10:23 p.m. to 11:40 p.m. (8:23 p.m. EST to 9:40 p.m.EST).   But just as the second launch window was opening, d'Allest saidthe failure of a remote sensor on the rocket's third stage wouldforce a delay until Saturday night or Sunday.   A decision was expected Saturday morning on when to reschedulethe launch.   It is the first commercial mission for the Ariane 4, a morepowerful and more versatile version of previous Ariane rockets,developed by the European Space Agency, a 13-member consortium ledby France.   In June, the Ariane 4 put three satellites into orbit in asuccessful demonstration launch.   Luxembourg's Astra 1A satellite has the potential to change theviewing habits of millions of Western Europeans, as receiving dishessprout on roofs and in back yards.   Beginning in late January, it will be able to beam 16 channels ofprogramming to an area that includes 85 percent of West Europeanhomes.   The European Satellite Company, a Luxembourg-based consortium,announced the sale of the 11th channel Friday to the Swedish companyEsselte, which plans a pay-TV film service called Filmnet.   Other channels already sold will offer sports, news and movies.   A competing direct-broadcast satellite, France's TDF-1, waslaunched by Ariane last month, but it has not yet lined upprogramming for its six channels.   Britain's Skynet 4B, the other satellite being launched, is toprovide communications for submarines and surface vessels of theBritish navy and ground stations.   Arianespace, the company set up to handle commercial launches ofthe Ariane rockets, had six previous launches in 1988, allsuccessful.</TEXT></DOC>
