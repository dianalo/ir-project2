Roy Gamse, MCI's vice president, marketing, said the company believes the growth potential for 800 service is &quot;significant.&quot; MCI estimates that the market for the service is increasing at a rate of 15% to 20% annually, compared with a 12% growth rate for the overall long-distance market.    Currently, only ATandamp;T offers nationwide toll-free long-distance service. US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., said it plans to introduce a nationwide 800 service this year.    MCI said its charges will be based on a flat, per-minute rate that reflects the distance of a call. The 800 service also will reach &quot;select international locations,&quot; the company said.    Other features of MCI's 800 service include no additional charge for using the same number for in-state and out-of-state calls, volume discounts and detailed information about calls.    ATandamp;T declined to comment on MCI's claims.    Toll-free 800 calls are billed to businesses that want to allow customers to call them without incurring a charge. </TEXT></DOC>
