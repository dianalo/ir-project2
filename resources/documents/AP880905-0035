There are just vast seas of muddy brown water_ and millions of stranded people.   Floods have inundated three-quarters of Bangladesh and cuttransportation links from its major port to the capital and otherinterior cities, officials say, though adding today that floodwaters on three major rivers were receding.   In Dhaka, flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 yearsand covered three-fourths of the capital.   Dhaka newspapers reported 60 more flood deaths today, bringingthe toll to at least 1,007 since June, when rivers beganoverflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in thisimpoverished nation of 110 million people.   The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low.   Millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy,probably contaminated water, and 83,000 people nationwide havecontracted diarrheal diseases, said Health Minister Abdul Munim.   He said 65 people have died of the diseases so far.   ``It is a calamity,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman toldreporters Sunday night. ``It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.''   Flying in an airplane across Bangladesh Sunday from the Indianborder to Dhaka, even the civilian pilot couldn't differentiatebetween the rivers and the flood waters.   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' said Ghias Ahmad,who has been flying over his country for 19 years.   The waters swallowed up entire villages. Occasionally, tin roofsglinted in the sunlight, the houses beneath them completelysubmerged.   On a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved roadstill above water, people milled idly, small boats beached besidethem.   The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and their dozens oftributaries flow from India and through Bangladesh to the Bay ofBengal.   The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains inBangladesh and India. Last year, the flooding in Bangladesh killedabout 1,500 people.   This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centersor relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke oncondition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 millionpeople were either stranded in their homes or marooned on smalloutcroppings of high ground with few supplies.   Wells and pumps are flooded, officials said, and flood water,which is probably impure, is the only source of drinking water.   The central government has appealed for foreign aid, includingboats, helicopters and 3 million tons of grain.   Officials today reported water levels falling on theBrahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna rivers. But relief officials cannotreach many parts of the country because transportation has widelybroken down.   ``Shortages of medicine, cooked food and drinking water iscausing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' a reliefministry official said on condition of anonymity.   The information minister said flood waters destroyed crops andcould prevent planting of the winter rice crop. He said this mightlead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice.   The minister said Bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice ayear to feed its people. He said 16.5 million tons are grown athome and 1.5 million imported.   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million people, gasoline has become scarcefor the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets. Many gasstations are closed.   Boats have replaced cars and bicycle-powered rickshaws in manyparts of the city. River boats capable of carrying 100 to 200people sail between partly submerged houses in low-lyingneighborhoods flooded by the Buriganga, Turag and Sitalakhya riversthat surround Dhaka on three sides.   Many of the capital's streets are knee-deep and waist-deep inmurky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage, andadults and children alike wade through it.   Over the last week, the price of rice nearly doubled, from 15cents a pound to 28 cents, as those who could afford it startedhoarding.</TEXT></DOC>
