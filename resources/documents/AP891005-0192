Manuel Antonio Noriega wasdoomed by misjudgments by the rebels as well as by American forces'lack of flexibility.   ``Every administration has a shakedown in one way or another andwe've learned some things about our operation that we need toimprove,'' said a senior administration official who insisted onanonymity. ``And we'll improve them.''   ``This is our first bloodletting, if you will,'' he said, thefirst ``kind of a crisis operation.''   Another U.S. official, evaluating the events of the past twodays, said the American forces in Panama were prepared for anycontingency _ ``from the maximum all the way to the minimum.'' Butthis official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, saidconstraints were placed on Gen. Maxwell Thurman of the SouthernCommand, who assumed his duties in Panama just two days before theinsurrection.   Evaluations also were beginning on Capitol Hill where Sen. DavidBoren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saidhis panel and the Senate Armed Services Committee were conductingan investigation of the administration's handling of the coup.   ``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' said Boren, whowas among the earliest to criticize Bush for inaction.   The Senate adopted, 99 to 1, a resolution proposed by Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., that expressed support for Bush's efforts todemocratize Panama through a ``full range of economic, diplomaticand military options.'' Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., was the lonedissenter.   While the official post-mortems were under way, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney said it was ``hogwash'' to suggest that theUnited States had refused an offer from the rebels to take custodyof Noriega.   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., did just that, telling the Senate,``They (the rebels) told the U.S. officers that they were holdingNoriega captive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody ofNoriega and remove him to the United States.''   Cheney said that rebels refused in a ``face-to-face contact''with a U.S. military officer to turn over Noriega during the coupattempt.   Helms also said that coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, had beenexecuted in Panama, adding, ``I have received reports from Panamathat Noriega personally shot the major.''   U.S. officials agreed that Giroldi probably was killed but addedthey were not certain.   A State Department source, speaking on condition that he not beidentified, said U.S. officials are working on the belief thatreports of Giroldi's death are ``solid information.''   ``He and at least two others have been shot. The story is theywere trying to escape,'' the source said, adding that theadministration officials do not give much credence to allegationsof an attempt to escape.   One official, speaking anonymously, said if the rebels haddelivered Noriega to a U.S. military facility, he would have beenflown to Florida before nightfall Tuesday to face federal drugcharges dating to February 1988.   Cheney and other administration officials continued theirdefense of Bush's handling of the coup attempt, and the decisionnot to become involved militarily. White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said, ``To have a handful of congressmen suggest it wasthe wrong course is a pretty minor response.''   At the same time, the administration emphasized its continuedopposition to Noriega by arranging for former opposition vicepresidential candidate Guillermo Ford to meet with Bush, VicePresident Dan Quayle and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.   In an appearance at the Capitol, Ford said Guillermo Endara,whose election as Panama's president was nullified by Noriega, hadtaken refuge in a party headquarters building which was surroundedby Noriega security forces.   ``Mr. Endara feels he's been detained by the defense forces,''said Ford. ``He is a very brave man. We are going to fight thedictatorship, no matter what.''   He said democracies must help Panama, adding, ``It's very hardto overthrow a dictatorship with rocks in your hand.''   Helms was not alone in criticizing the administration.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the administration's storya ``weak-kneed explanation for failure'' and said the United Stateshad ``botched'' the handling of the coup. ``It's an incrediblestain on us,'' he said.   Speaking only on condition they not be identified by name, U.S.officials placed primary responsibility for the failure of the coupon the rebels.   ``It was their failure, not ours,'' one said.   Bush's personal involvement in Tuesday morning's events was notclear but the officials said his heavy schedule prevented him fromdevoting full time to the subject.   Two hours after the first shots were fired, Bush went to theWhite House south lawn for the arrival ceremony of MexicanPresident Carlos Salinas de Gortari and much of the late morningwas devoted to Salinas.   The rebels were described by one U.S. official as ``extremelynaive'' in their assumptions and judgments. Cited specifically werethe decision to release Noriega after holding him for several hoursand the assumptions that a key battalion would not come toNoriega's aid and that the Panamanian people would join therebellion.   Washington's reluctance to give U.S. commanders the flexibilityto deal with rapidly changing developments also was cited as animportant factor in the failure of the coup.   The U.S. Southern Command, having been alerted about 30 hours inadvance that a move against Noriega was afoot, began blocking keyaccess routes to the military headquarters before dawn on Tuesday.   Shortly after sunrise, an estimated 200 rebels seized control ofthe Defense Force headquarters and took Noriega into custody.   Most of the access routes pass through U.S. militaryinstallations, and U.S. commanders acted within their authority inblockading them, the officials said.   But the pro-Noriega forces surprised the rebels by using aBoeing 727 and some smaller aircraft to fly about 100 troops to anairstrip near the headquarters. Shortly thereafter, Battalion 2000,to the surprise of the rebels, threw its support to Noriega afterrefusing to take sides in the early going.   The U.S. officials said that although the U.S. military commandin Panama had troops on key routes, they lacked the discretionaryauthority to counter surprise moves by forces loyal to Noriega.   As officials described it, the worst misjudgment of the rebelswas to set Noriega free after the headquarters was surrounded.   If Noriega had been flown out, ``the loyalist forces wouldn'thave anybody to be loyal to'' and the post-Noriega era would havebegun in Panama, one official said.   Defending the Bush administration against charges that it actedtimidly in not coming to the aid of the rebels, Cheney said in aninterview with CBS that the coup leaders had no intention offorcing Noriega from the country. ``This was not a situation wherewe had a pro-democracy movement trying to topple a dictator andrestore democracy to Panama,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
