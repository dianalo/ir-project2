Peterson attributed the surge in last-minute applications toprocrastination and fear about the program. He said Sunday that hisoffice processed over 300 applications last week.   Undocumented aliens face a midnight Wednesday deadline to fileapplications for legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform andControl Act. They must prove continuous residency in the UnitedStates since Jan. 1, 1982. Filing is the first step towardcitizenship.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service office in CorpusChristi, Texas, handled about 250 applications Saturday and Sunday,said spokesman Carlos Paz, who believed many more would have shownup had they expected the office to be open through the weekend.   ``This whole month we have processed 1,858 people, which isalmost what we did in the first three or four months of theprogram,'' Paz said.   Paz said some applicants slept outside the center to completepaperwork and wait for a work permit rather than file applicationsand set a date for a later appointment.   ``They're getting desperate because they've waited too long, andsome are still looking for additional paperwork and they're findingout they don't have the documents,'' said Paz. ``And a lot of themdon't have the money (for the filing fee), let's face it.''   More than 1,000 illegal aliens applied in Oklahoma City lastweek _ fewer than expected, officials said.   James Walsh, officer in charge of the office, said the poorOklahoma economy may have made it tough for some applicants to comeup with the filing fee of $185 a person or up to $420 per family.He also cited the mobility of the illegal alien population for thesmaller than expected number of applicants.   In New York, officials believe the number of applications willexceed the revised target of 100,000. They cited a sharp upturn inthe number of aliens crowding INS offices in recent days.   One illegal immigrant who applied last week, Luis Lopez, 38,said receiving legal status means being able to work without fearon a western Michigan farm.   Lopez said he paid to be smuggled into the United States fromhis native Mexico in 1972.   ``I can look any man in the eye now and not be afraid,'' Lopezsaid. ``I can walk straight, as a man should. The burden has beenlifted off my shoulders.''   Wednesday's deadline does not apply to aliens applying for legalstatus under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker provision of theimmigration reform act. They have until Nov. 30.   With the amnesty program about to end, the government ispreparing to shift the emphasis to employers. The immigrationreform act mandates sanctions against employers who knowingly hireundocumented workers.   Starting June 1, the INS has the discretion to issue warningcitations or fine employers who violate the law. Currently, the INSmust initially issue warning citations.</TEXT></DOC>
