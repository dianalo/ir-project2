(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Brio Technology Inc.andM;DATAPRISM 1.1andM;DataPrism's ability to let the user quickly develop accurate queries islargely due to the power of its constraints.andM;When logging on to DataPrism, for example, information constraints can be setin the table filter.andP;  Constraints can be set against the creator name, tablename or a specified user name.andM;Filtering the list of table names in this fashion would be particularlyuseful in a company that uses many tables.andP;  For example, a user could set aconstraint asking for all tables created by a specific employee.andM;Within queries, double-clicking on a column name brings up a window forselecting one of 11 constraint possibilities, such as &quot;not equal to&quot; or&quot;contains.&quot; Double-clicking also allows users to enter custom SQL queries.andM;When a column is being constrained, a list of valid choices is presented; amouse is used to select the choices.andP;  This helps ensure that only validconstraints are specified.andM;As tables are loaded, DataPrism automatically joins tables with identicalcolumn names.andP;  Joins can also be manually established simply by drawing aline between two columns.andM;Each selected table is displayed as a scrolling list on-screen, with linesconnecting the columns to create logical relationships between them.andO;Creating a query is simply a matter of dragging the desired column names tothe Request bar at the top of the screen and clicking on the process button.andM;PC Week Labs found this process to be quick and easy to use.andP;  The results ofa DataPrism query are displayed in a file that can be saved in text format,Excel standard or SYLK format, or Lotus 1-2-3 WKS format.andP;  Results can alsobe printed directly from DataPrism, but the only format features that can bespecified are column widths.andM;The results of a query can be further constrained or sorted; all additionalprocessing occurs on the workstation.andM;DataPrism also offers a charting facility that lets users create bar charts.andO;PC Week Labs found this facility rudimentary, however.andP;  Users who havecomplex charting needs will probably import their data into a more powerful,full-featured charting package.andM;DataPrism gives users the option of viewing and editing the SQL code as it isgenerated.andP;  As with the other reviewed products, however, SQL code added bythe user is not checked for proper syntax.andM;DataPrism's documentation consists of a users guide with a brief tutorial anda reference guide.andP;  Although both volumes are slim, they are well-written,well-illustrated guides to the product.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;Brio Technology Inc.andM;Mountain View, Calif.andP;  (800) 486-2746andM;or (415) 961-4110andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1984andM;Number of employees: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;Source.andP;  Computer Directory on CompuServe.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
