The $9.73 billion British distiller, gambling and franchise concern said it is taking seriously reports that someone -- perhaps Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. -- is seeking buyers for all or parts of the company. Drexel is one of five investment banking concerns hired by Pillsbury to defend itself against Grand Met's $5.23 billion tender offer.    &quot;When there's a gap as big as there is between our share price and {breakup value} you have to take it seriously just as a technical matter,&quot; Ian A. Martin, chief executive officer of Grand Met's U.S. operations and a company director, said in an interview yesterday. &quot;On the other hand, it seems to me there's very little industrial logic for Pillsbury to try to take over Grand Met. So the only conclusion I can come to is that {if the rumors are true} they're trying to frighten us to abandon our bid, or something of that kind.&quot;    Despite his personal doubts, Mr. Martin said that for the company to protect itself, &quot;We have to get into a defensive crouch.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate.    A Pillsbury spokesman wouldn't comment on the reports, which first appeared in London's Sunday Telegraph.    Grand Met's breakup value has been assessed at between #7 and #10 a share ($12.46 to $17.80) by various securities analysts recently, Mr. Martin said. In late Friday trading on the London Stock Exchange, Grand Met closed at 438.5 pence ($7.80) a share, down 50 pence. Thus, Grand Met is trading at a substantial discount.    Pointing out that Pillsbury is half Grand Met's size, Mr. Martin said he doubts the Minneapolis food and restaurant concern would implement what is known as a Pac-Man defense. That strategy takes its name from the video game in which the smaller prey gobbles up its pursuers. &quot;I find it very hard to see it as other than a ploy or tactic to see if they can scare us off,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, he said: &quot;We have to take it seriously. We're in a major bid battle here. We don't know the source of the rumors or how serious they were.&quot;    In Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Pillsbury has listed the purchase of Grand Met shares, alone or with a third party, as among the options it was considering to repel Grand Met's $60-a-share tender offer. That offer is to expire at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, but there were indications that it might again be extended.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pillsbury closed at $58.375 a share, down 25 cents.    A Pillsbury lawyer said in a Minnesota court hearing Friday that one of Grand Met's outside directors is to face a deposition by Pillsbury tomorrow. &quot;If their offer is scheduled to expire Monday, it doesn't make a great deal of sense to produce the gentleman on Tuesday,&quot; said Steven J. Rothschild, of the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom.    Grand Met had no comment on Mr. Rothschild's speculation. It has extended its offer twice already. Grand Met said last week that nearly 75% of Pillsbury's stock has been tendered.    Since the bid for Pillsbury was made Oct. 4, both sides have been skirmishing in court over the validity of Pillsbury's poison pill, which thus far has prevented Grand Met from accepting the tendered shares, since it would make the acquisition significantly more costly.    Today, both sides were to present written briefs to a Delaware Chancery Court on the merits of the poison pill. There was no indication of when that court might rule on the matter.    The Minnesota court upheld Pillsbury's poison pill but encouraged the company to negotiate with Grand Met. The transcript in that case quotes Mr. Rothschild as saying that while the two sides haven't talked, Pillsbury has furnished Grand Met &quot;with just an enormous amount of information of a non-public nature . . . {which} even goes so far as to set forth numbers that were developed by our investment bankers.&quot;    ---   Richard L.
