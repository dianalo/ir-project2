We deplore both book-banning and fanatical threats on human lifewhich threaten the free exchange of ideas.   But we must also see that free expression is not the issue formany followers of Islam.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on refugees:   The problem of refugees is as old as the problem of humanconflict. Currently, more than 13 million people around the worldneed protection and assistance after fleeing their homes because ofwars and insurrections, political oppression or economic hardship.   Yet, according to a study from the Worldwatch Institute inWashington D.C., that sobering figure will soon be exceeded by aless traditional category of refugees _ people displaced from theirhomes because of environmental disasters.   Those disasters may be sudden, like the 1986 nuclear accident atChernobyl. ... Other disasters are more gradual, such as theimpoverishment of productive farmland in sub-Saharan Africa. ...   In many parts of Africa and Asia, land that is still usable hasbeen strained to the point that it can no longer yield enough toguarantee a suitable diet.   The result is malnutrition, a warning sign that migration _ themost drastic response to environmental degradation _ is likely to bethe inhabitants' next response.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 21   Los Angeles Times on South African racism and poverty in SouthAfrica:   An extraordinary eight-year study ... has detailed morethoroughly than ever before the appalling depths of South Africa'spoverty, the pervasive suffering of its black majority and theinexorable change taking place that may _ or may not _ lead todemocracy and liberation from racism. ...   The report, co-authored by South Africans Francis Wilson andMamphela Ramphele, rejects the present-day strategy of theirgovernment to eliminate piecemeal some of the elements of apartheid....   ``The agony of South Africa is due primarily to the fact thatthose with political power have left no room for those who wouldchange the society to use legitimate democratic channels to do so,''Wilson and Ramphele write. ...   Wilson is a professor of economics at the University of CapeTown. Ramphele is also on the faculty there and is a celebratedfigure in efforts to end apartheid.   They share the credit with 450 others _ scholars, researchers,experts in special fields _ who generated about 300 separate studypapers that were the basis for the final report. ...   It is already on sale in South Africa and will be available soonin American bookstores. It is required reading for anyone who wouldseek to understand South Africa and try to facilitate the cause ofjustice there.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 19   The Journal, Providence, R.I., on Winnie Mandela:   Among South Africa's repressed black majority, Winnie Mandela hasstood for years as a proud symbol of the fight against the country'shated system of apartheid.   Last week, however, her prestige was shattered when fellowapartheid foes denounced her, saying her increasingly erraticbehavior was injuring their cause. ...   Mrs. Mandela, who in 1986 had endorsed the practice of murderingblack informers and government collaborators, had become toomilitant for many other black leaders.   She became a publicity hound, built an enormous mansion in Sowetoand organized tough bodyguards into a so-called ``soccer club.''Hers became a cult of personal power run amok. ...   While it may have pained black South Africans to spurn a womanthey had once admired, they correctly saw that their cause was tooprecious to risk for anyone's personal ambition.   Perhaps from a distorted sense of loyalty to her jailed husbandand his quiet crusade, Winnie Mandela overreached herself.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 17   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on the Soviet withdrawal fromAfghanistan:   Like the U.S. departure from Vietnam, the exodus of Soviet forcesfrom Afghanistan will not bring peace to that devastated land.   In fact, the Soviet army's departure is only the prelude for whatmay be even more savage fighting between the government andguerrilla forces.   The parallels with Vietnam are remarkable. Soviet soldiersreturning home have reported that the public is indifferent and doesnot appreciate their service. ...   The United States went to Vietnam to stop the spread ofcommunism, but left with the entire country under Communistdomination. The Soviets went to Afghanistan to support a Communistpuppet regime, but left that regime to its fate at the hands of alarge and confident guerrilla force.   The lesson of the past two decades is one that has been learnedbefore: Wars often are fought for the wrong reason and createdisasters greater than the ones they were designed to prevent.   The Soviets have left Afghanistan. The disaster they leave behindwill be a cruel burden for the people of Afghanistan and for thosewho support them for decades to come.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
