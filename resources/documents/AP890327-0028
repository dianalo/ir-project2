(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Virginia is going to have the first statelaboratory in the nation with a data bank of genetic prints, whichallow police to nab criminals from scanty physical evidence likesaliva left at a crime scene.   The Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services willprovide DNA testing for the state's police and sheriff'sdepartments beginning May 1.   DNA testing is ``the most significant development for lawenforcement since fingerprinting, and that dates back about 100years,'' said Paul B. Ferrara, director of the state Bureau ofForensic Science.   The lab will develop a computerized data bank of DNA prints ofsex offenders in the state. State legislation passed last monthrequires sex offenders to submit blood samples for DNA analysis.   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes ofcells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bonemarrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, orgenetic blueprint.   Scientists in recent years have developed technology for takingDNA from body fluids or tissue left at a crime scene and matchingit with the genetic blueprint of a suspect.   ``If a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene ... he might aswell be leaving his Social Security card,'' Ferrara said.   He said DNA testing already helped nabbed one person in Virginia_ Timothy Spencer of Richmond, who was convicted of three capitalmurders on the basis of genetic printing.   ``I'm not a lawyer, but based on what I've been told, TimothySpencer probably never would have been convicted without the DNAtesting,'' Ferrara said. The case is under review by the stateSupreme Court.   Ferrara said DNA testing also could serve as a criminaldeterrent. He said criminals can be careful not to leavefingerprints, as Spencer was, but the chances of committing aviolent crime without leaving a DNA sample are slim.   Pre-DNA analysis of body fluids, tissue and hair left at crimescenes consisted of examining enzymes and blood types _ processeswhich only narrowed the list of possible perpetrators.   ``Conventional serological evidence was always circumstantial,''Ferrara said. ``You could say that a particular sample could havecome from, say, 13 percent of the male population. But with DNAtesting, you can say this sample definitely came from that person.It's just like fingerprints in that respect.''   DNA is inherited, with each parent contributing one-half. Forabout 10 years, scientists have used DNA testing to establishpaternity and to research genetically related diseases.   About three years ago, DNA testing was first used to solve arape in a small town in England, Ferrara said. The technology hassince been used to solve several crimes in the United States, butVirginia is among the first states to implement widespread DNAtesting.   Two Virginia serologists were trained in DNA testing at a lab inNew York and Ferrara received $80,000 from the state for equipmentand supplies.   Last year, Ferrara secured an additional $200,000 in state fundsto keep the program going.</TEXT></DOC>
