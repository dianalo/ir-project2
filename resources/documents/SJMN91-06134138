Fifteen buildings were destroyed andthree dozen shops have closed or moved.;    Add drought, freeze and thegeneral economic slowdown and you've got a blueprint for hard times in thisclose-knit &quot;Earthquake Capital of the World&quot; -- a town dominated by churchspires, a farm economy and San Benito Street, the main drag that was overrunin 1947 by 4,000 rowdy bikers, enough to inspire the 1954 Brando movie.;   &quot;People were saying, 'Why us? What the hell did we do?' &quot; said Al Martinez ofEconomic Development Corp. of San Benito County.;    &quot;They've taken it on thechin, and sure it hurts,&quot; Reyes said. &quot;But you pick yourself up. . . . It'sonly a temporary setback.&quot;;    When dust and smoke cleared, people realizeddisaster meant opportunity to rebuild even better, he said.;    &quot;Maybe it wasa blessing in disguise,&quot; said Stephanie Willhoft of the chamber of commerce.;   Said Mayor Mary Kuckenbaker: &quot;I'm feeling pretty optimistic. And people seemto be in better spirits.&quot;;    The jobless rate is up -- at 21 percent, it'sthe highest since 1983 -- but the number of available jobs is finally rising,for everything from farmworkers to professionals.;    &quot;It's starting to turnaround,&quot; said Marcelo Rodriguez of the local state employment office.;   Also, March rain gave the $123 million farm industry a needed drink. &quot;It didwonders,&quot; said Mark Tognazzini, county agriculture commissioner.;    Ranchersin the $14 million-a-year cattle business, No. 2 in the county's agriculturereport, have stopped thinning their herds. That's good news for a town thatdepends on their business.;    In Hollister itself, optimism centers on plansfor downtown renaissance, which picked up momentum, purpose and believersafter the earthquake and fires.;    &quot;It has never looked more promising,&quot; saidMichael Winn, owner of the burned-out Wooden Spoon eatery, where for 10 yearsa hearty New England clam chowder drew a steady lunch crowd.;    &quot;Sometimes ittakes a major catastrophe before things get going,&quot; said Winn, who, like othermerchants, prefers the historic downtown and its Main Street Americaatmosphere to modern shopping centers where rents are steeper.;    ElodieAlipaz, co-owner of Hollister-Goularte Floral Co., was burned out in Marchalong with eight other merchants, and reopened in cramped quarters off anearby alley. Rebuilding plans are under way, she said.;    &quot;We don't plan onleaving the downtown,&quot; she said.;    The city's downtown plan calls forspending $20 million over 10 years. New paving and landscaping, more parkingand lighting, and face lifts for tired shop fronts are among the strategies todraw people and business downtown.;    The keys are innovation and cooperationbetween the public and private sectors, redevelopment manager Reyes said.;   One example is what's happening with an empty lot earmarked for a three-storymix of senior housing, offices and stores. Some funding will come from stateand federal grants or loans, the rest from private investors.;    &quot;The cityhas gotten money from every source they could get their hands on,&quot; Martinezsaid.;    After more than 1 1/2 years of planning, rebuilding throughout thedowntown could start this summer. Some merchants plan to reopen byThanksgiving, Reyes said.;    &quot;When people see that happening,&quot; Martinez said,&quot;it will spark enthusiasm and lift spirits.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK FOLEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910513  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  705  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 13, 199100134138,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
