Already a decision istaking shape to deny arms to Baghdad -- at least if Saddam Hussein survives.;   If Saddam is forced from power, U.S. contingency plans include the prospectof providing aid to Iraq and other nations that suffered losses in the PersianGulf war.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AID TO IRAQ POSSIBLE IF SADDAM LEAVESU.S. SHAPING STRATEGY FOR POSTWAR MIDEAST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  War in the GulfSee also related stories on pages 1A, 12A-20A in this sectionAdditional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     New security arrangements, arms control, attention to the Arab-Israelidispute and economic reconstruction are the main goals. In addition, someIraqi officials may be tried for war crimes.;    President Bush said Wednesdayhe is sending Secretary of State James Baker to the Middle East next week tomake a survey.;    Final decisions by Bush rested on consultations with theallies in the 32-nation war coalition.;    Baker cautioned that the task wasformidable.;    &quot;Securing the peace in this region in the aftermath of thisconflict is not going to be any easy job,&quot; he said. &quot;It is going to be verydifficult.&quot;;    Referring especially to the Arab-Israeli dispute, Baker said&quot;there are both challenges and opportunities in the aftermath of this crisis.You are not going to make progress on Arab-Israeli peace unless the partiesthemselves really want to make progress.&quot;;    However, signaling hisdetermination to try, Baker added: &quot;At the first appropriate opportunity wewill be seeing the degree to which the parties on both sides are interested inintensively pursuing peace.&quot;;    On other fronts, even at this preliminarystage, the United States and Britain seem to be ready to urge the U.N.Security Council to maintain an embargo on arms shipments to Iraq if Saddamremains in charge.;    &quot;As long as that particular government continues inpower,&quot; Baker said, &quot;we want to make certain, at least with respect to arms,that there's some sort of constraints upon rearmament and on the shipment ofarms into that country -- in particular, weapons of mass destruction.&quot;;   Baker told Congress it might be possible for a coalition of countries in theregion to take on the job of economic reconstruction, with the United Statesand other outsiders providing technical advice.;    But achieving security inthe region is bound to require an aggressive U.S. role. The big question iswhether U.S. diplomacy will be supplemented by Bush keeping some U.S. groundforces in the region.;    The Navy, having patrolled gulf waters for 40 years,is certain to stay, albeit its size slashed from its current armadaproportions.;    There is broad consensus within the alliance, meanwhile, thatsecurity arrangements must be undertaken to shield Saudi Arabia and smallergulf states, such as Kuwait, from Saddam-like aggression.;    Iraq'sblitzkrieg thrust into Kuwait on Aug. 2 ignited a seven-month crisis, upsetthe region's uneasy equilibrium and exposed states such as Saudi Arabia andits smaller gulf partners -- as well as Israel -- to the frightening prospectsof a demonic dictator launching poison gas and indiscriminate missileattacks.;    U.S. officials say Bush has not yet decided on the two keypoints: whether American, Canadian and British forces will be part of asecurity shield along with Arab nations and whether the shield will extendnorthward.;    &quot;It's clear neither the United States nor Britain wants to keepforces in Iraq or in the region for any longer than is necessary,&quot; Hurd toldreporters.;    The Soviet Union, not having contributed troops to the assaulton Kuwait, evidently also will not participate in the security coalition. ButSoviet cooperation in controlling the spread of weapons into the volatileregion is considered essential.;    Three radical Arab states -- Iraq, Syriaand Libya -- built their arsenals partly on billions of dollars of Sovietweapons. Baker, with support from some members of Congress, will try toreverse the proliferation.;    Initially, U.S. officials said, the goal is toprevent the introduction of new weapons into the region and to stop the influxof ballistic missiles as well as nuclear and chemical weapons technology.;   Mounting evidence of Iraqi war atrocities also raises the prospect the allieswill hold war crimes trials.;    From the White House to the Pentagon toallied headquarters in Saudi Arabia, officials emphasize their intention tohold Iraqi officials responsible for violations of international law.;    U.S.authorities insist that they have not settled on a course of action to punishthe guilty, but the commanding general of the Joint Arab Forces has vowed thata war crimes tribunal will be held.;    &quot;We warn all who have taken part inthe many crimes against innocent civilians in Kuwait, whether by rape, murderor torture, that they will be held responsible before an international courtof justice and will be treated as criminals of war,&quot; Saudi Lt. Gen. Khalid binSultan said Monday.;    Allied military officials have accused the Iraqimilitary of brutalizing prisoners of war, conducting mass executions ofKuwaiti civilians, kidnapping civilians to be used as human shields andwidespread destruction of property.;    Homicide estimates range from a fewhundred to several thousand, and the cost of property damage has been placedin the billions of dollars.;    Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said militarylawyers have been &quot;making book on the Iraqis, keeping track of potential warcrimes, since this invasion started on Aug. 2.&quot;;    He said the allies stillare studying ways to track down Iraqi field commanders suspected of orderingtheir troops to commit the widespread atrocities reported against civilians inoccupied Kuwait.;    &quot;We won't be able to make any of the important decisionsabout that kind of procedure -- about war crimes procedure -- until . . . wehave a chance to look at the evidence,&quot; Williams said.; Mideast goals; Thefour principal U.S. policy objectives in the Middle East:; (box)New securityarrangements; (box)Control the influx and spread of arms; (box)Dealing withthe Arab-Israeli dispute; (box)Economic reconstruction  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910228  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  987  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 28, 199100059199,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
