In particular, the effects of the presence of a strong magneticfield on the development of a thermonuclear runaway (TNR) are studied.The magnetic field is capable of weakening the outburst both throughthe inhibition of shear and diffusion mixing (which results in lowerenrichments by heavy elements) and by interference with the developmentof convection during the TNR (which results in lower ejection velocities).The apparent absence of classical novae among AM Her systems may neverthelesshave been due to selection effects, which are a consequence of the loweraccretion rates below the period gap and the very narrow range in massratios capable of producing novae below the gap. 37 references.</TEXT></DOC>
