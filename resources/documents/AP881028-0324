(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham LambertInc.'s high-yield bond chief who's at the center of a federalinsider-trading probe, says the ordeal of the nearly 2-year-oldinvestigation has taken a personal toll.   ``The last 20 months have been very painful. The strain has beenenormous,'' Milken said in a rare interview, published Friday in TheTrentonian newspaper. ``Am I operating at my fullest capacity? No.Will my life be shorter? Possibly. I don't know how many morewrinkles there are on my heart.''   The Trentonian is owned by Ingersoll Publications Co., whosechief executive Ralph Ingersoll is a personal friend of Milken's anda Drexel client.   Ingersoll has been an outspoken defender of Milken and hasaccused the government of creating a witch-hunt atmosphere againstthe wealthy 42-year-old investment banker, who is considered apioneer in the $100 billion market for high-yield, non-investmentgrade securities commonly called junk bonds.   Drexel, Milken and three other key employees were accused by theSecurities and Exchange Commission of insider trading, stockmanipulation and other civil fraud charges Sept. 7, after a longinvestigation by the enforcement agency stemming from disclosuresfrom now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky.   More serious criminal charges have been expected since federalprosecutors notified the firm earlier this month that it was thetarget of a grand jury investigation. The defendants have denied anywrongdoing.   Milken declined to discuss the accusations against him in theinterview, but instead stressed what he called his deep affectionfor his family and extensive philanthropic activities. He downplayedthe importance he has placed on his high-flung career.   Professional milestones, he said, pale in significance to a son'sproblems with seizures and his father's bout with cancer.   ``My first bond issue?'' he asked. ``It was less satisfying thanfinding out what was wrong with Greg, less satisfying than learning(his son) Lance was chosen valedictorian.''   A dream day, he added, ``would begin with my wife calling me tosays she's pregnant.''   A native Californian who parlayed Drexel to the forefront ofhigh-yield bond underwriting, Milken is known for working 12-hourdays, seven days a week. He reportedly makes $40 million a year.   His wife _ a high school sweetheart whom Milken married at 22 _remains fiercely proud and defensive of him.   ``I've told (the children), `Your father is a genius and hasrevolutionized the finance industry,''' Lori Milken said in theIngersoll interview.   ```People don't like change, and they're trying to get rid ofyour father, and if you look in your history books, you'll see thatpeople who have tried to make change have had this happen.'''   Whatever his fondness for family, Milken denied wishing he couldgo back and pursue a lower-profile career.   ``Leave no mark in the sand?'' he asked. ``No, I haven't reachedthat point yet.''</TEXT></DOC>
