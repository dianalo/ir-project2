(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggart led thechoir but stayed away from the pulpit during Sunday services at hischurch, two days after separating from the Assemblies of God.   Swaggart announced Friday he was resigning from the Assembliesof God, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, shortlyafter the church said it was defrocking him in the aftermath of hisconfession to a moral failure.   ``Give the Lord a hand of praise,'' Swaggart shouted whileprancing on the stage as he led the choir in a rendition of ``HeSet Me Free.''   The 13-member Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies, based inSpringfield, Mo., ordered Swaggart last month to submit to atwo-year rehabilitation plan which included a one-year suspensionfrom preaching, a harsher punishment than originally ordered byLouisiana church elders.   Swaggart said separating from the church was necessary to savehis Bible college and $140 million worldwide ministry. His lawyer,William Treeby, said the organization is in a precarious position,but would not fail financially.   ``We believe that to stay out of the pulpit for a year wouldtotally destroy the television ministry and greatly adverselyimpact the college,'' Swaggart said Friday.   Soon after the Presbytery ordered the one-year suspension,Treeby announced that Swaggart would return to the pulpit on May22, coinciding with the end of the three-month suspension firstordered by Louisiana church leaders.   The Rev. Al Trotter, a guest preacher at Sunday's services, madea brief reference to Swaggart.   ``Just one thing is agitating me and just one thing is fillingme with nervous anticipation. That's for Sunday, May 22, to rollaround and for the bishop to take the pulpit again,'' Trotter said.   Swaggart's punishment was handed down after he publiclyconfessed to unspecified sin on Feb. 21. A self-describedprostitute said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him in NewOrleans.   Another defrocked Assemblies of God minister, Marvin Gorman ofsuburban New Orleans, reportedly hired men who photographedSwaggart with the woman outside a motel.   According to new ratings, Swaggart's television ministry was indecline even before his confession.   Swaggart's weekly program remained No. 1 among religiousbroadcasts, but viewership fell from 2.161 million households inFebruary 1987 to 1.961 million in February this year, Arbitron saidin a report released Saturday.   Nearly three weeks of the February sweeps period had passed whenSwaggart's scandal surfaced.   His daily program, ``A Study in the Word,'' fell from 410,000households to 323,000 households, according to Arbitron. It israted 10th in religious programming, according to Arbitron.   Swaggart's audience fell by 200,000 households or 10 percentduring the year for the weekly program and by 87,000 households or22 percent on a daily basis, according to Arbitron.   The television ratings to be taken in May, which would bereleased during the summer, will most accurately gauge whetherSwaggart's broadcast influence is languishing because of hisseparation from the Pentecostal denomination.   The Rev. Jerry Falwell's show dropped 40 percent during theyear. The PTL program, once hosted by defrocked Assemblies of Godminister Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, did not crack the Top 20.It had been rated No. 18 in November 1987, when the last ratingswere taken.   Three cable networks that carry Christian-oriented programs havethreatened to cancel Swaggart's shows, cutting him off from 68million potential viewers.   In mid-March, Swaggart's wife, Frances, and son Donnie hosted aweek-long telethon during which they begged viewers to send moneyor use their credit cards to make donations to keep the ministryalive.</TEXT></DOC>
