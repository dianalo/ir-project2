For cooling purposes, heat storage systemsusing ice have already been put to practical use. The latent heat offusion of ice is about 80 kcal/kg. Apparently, the heat storage tankto be used appears to require only a 1/18 theoretical capacity comparedto the use of water (7{sup 0}C-12{sup 0}C) for heat storage. Practically,however, the medium should be fluid and therefore should be of a freezerate of about 40 percent. Thus tanks for this purpose are usually designedwith a 1/6 capacity compared to water heat storage tanks. Major latentheat storage mediums that are under development or have already beencommercialized are listed, and some techniques and improvements requiredto use these heat storage mediums more effectively and practically aredescribed. Further studies are needed to develop latent heat storagemediums with a melting point suitable for heat pump systems, water heatersusing latent heat, and techniques for applying these mediums to floorheating.
