<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0723 </DOCNO><TEXT>Points out technological processes in GDR brown coal briquetting plantsthat were successfully automated by introduction of computerized monitoringand operation. The first process is automated raw coal distribution.A new type of mechanical force indicator at belt conveyor stripping bladeswas developed that transmits data for automated operation of coal feedbelt conveyors. The process of coal drying in large rotary dryers with2,000 m{sup 2} drying surface was automated by installation of indicatorsof dried coal moisture content (working indirectly, i.e. measuring bothvapor temperature and condensate temperature followed by computer calculationsof the remaining coal moisture according to an equation that is given).The equipment requires calibration; calculated indicating error was +/-1% for the coal moisture range of 17 to 25% during 18 months trial equipmenttesting. A further field of automation is maintaining the filling degreeof the dryer. A flowsheet of installed equipment configuration is provided.Other improvements concern monitoring dust released and filling briquettingpresses with the aid of controlled steam injection. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
