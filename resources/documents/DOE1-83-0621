The catalytic activity of 17 catalystsin the hydrogenation of the coal is examined. It is found that pure chemicalagents are better than natural iron ores and red mud - an industrialwaste. Stannous chloride is the best among them. The pyrite from Yangquanand red mud from Shandong are superior among the natural iron ores andred muds. Based on Freeman-Carrol method, the kinetic parameters of hydrogenationof Huangxian coal using SnCl{sub 2}, 2H{sub 2}/sub O/, Ni{sub 2}O{sub3} and pyrite from Yangquan as catalysts were calculated. The heat effectof Ni{sub 2}O{sub 3} in catalytic hydrogenation of Huangxian coal is1.92x10{sup 3}J/g. 11 refs., 2 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
