RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to let Idahoofficials tax the income of railway workers who live elsewhere butpass through the state as crew members on non-stop freight trains.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that such a taxwould violate the Constitution and be unfair to the workers.   The Idaho Supreme Court ruled last May that Burlington NorthernRailroad crews working on trains traveling between Spokane, Wash.,and Whitefish or Missoula, Mont., may not be forced to pay the tax.   The trains cross Idaho's panhandle without making any scheduledstops in the state.   Idaho officials in 1983 ordered the railway workers to pay taxeson income received from 1978 through 1982. The state sought toimpose the tax on a portion of the workers' income state officialssaid was earned while in Idaho.   The state Supreme Court said, ``Idaho is not the source of thisincome since there is no contribution by Idaho to the production ofthis income. It would be unfair to allow the state to impose a taxon the income of the train crews earned while they are merelypassing through Idaho.''   The state court said the tax violates the Constitution byinterfering with interstate commerce and by denying the workers dueprocess protection.   The state court added that the workers' wages while passingthrough Idaho ``are not attributable to any economic activity withinIdaho, and Idaho markets and commerce do not affect their income inany degree.''   The state court relied largely on U.S. Supreme Court rulingsholding that the test for the constitutionality of a state taxaffecting out-of-state residents is ``whether the state has givenanything for which it can ask return.''   The state Court said while the state has given something of valueto Burlington Northern, it ``has not given anything to the traincrews for which it can ask return.''   In the appeal acted on today, Idaho officials said the statecourt ruling ``sets a dangerous and disruptive precedent'' andconflicts with decisions by other courts giving states sweepingpower to tax non-residents who work within those states.   ``Taxpayers in other jurisdictions are now lining up to challengetaxation of non-residents based on Idaho's decision,'' the state'sappeal said.   The case is Idaho Tax Commission vs. Blangers, 88-1266.</TEXT></DOC>
