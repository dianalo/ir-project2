(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan, whose failure maycost the government $2.5 billion, invested $100 million with insidetrader Ivan Boesky, according to newspaper reports.   Lincoln's heavy investments in high-yield, high-risk corporatesecurities are well-known, and were one reason why the recentfederal savings-and-loan bailout bill banned thrifts from investingin such securities, called junk bonds.   Articles in Wednesday's editions of The Los Angeles Times and TheOrange County Register detailed other types of risky investments byLincoln, including attempts to profit in various ways from takeovers.   Lincoln officials apparently had no knowledge of Boesky's illegalinformation gathering, according to the Times, which citedunidentified sources familiar with Lincoln's operations.   Lincoln invested $100 million with Boesky's Hudson Funding Corp.Boesky, the Wall Street trader known for investing in companies thatfrequently became takeover candidates, was forced to liquidate thefund prematurely when he pleaded guilty to securities law violations.   The Times said Lincoln statements showed the company hoped toreap a 29 percent return on the investment in the fund, but quotedunidentified sources as saying the company realized a 9 percentprofit.   The Register said Lincoln broke even on the investment.   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, the day after itsparent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, filed forprotection under federal bankruptcy laws.   The House Banking Committee plans to reopen an investigation intoLincoln's collapse, a failure that regulators and analysts say couldresult in the government's most costly bailout, requiring more than$2.5 billion in federal funds.   Attorneys for American Continental dispute that figure, and saylosses were brought on by the regulators who seized the thrift.   In November 1986, Boesky pleaded guilty to felony insidertrading. He paid a $100 million fine and is serving three years in afederal prison.   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision found that Lincoln madenumerous risky investments with federally insured deposits, evenafter regulators, citing the Boesky expenditures, criticized thethrift in March 1987.   However, Lincoln fared well with some of its high-risk ventures.The Register said investments with British financier Sir JamesGoldsmith earned Lincoln $31 million in 1986.   In a related development, The Arizona Republic in Phoenixreported in a copyright story prepared for Thursday's editions thata California state official in late 1984 authorized Lincoln toengage in $800 million in risky ventures and then became a directorand officer of a San Diego firm about the same time the firmreceived a $2.9 million investment from Lincoln.   Larry Taggart, commissioner of California's Department of Savingsand Loan from March 1983 to Jan. 1, 1985, on Wednesday told theRepublic he helped arrange a meeting that may have led to Lincoln'sJanuary 1985 agreement to purchase stock in TCS Financial Inc., afinancial-services firm now known as TCS Enterprises Inc.   Taggart said there was no impropriety and no conflict of interestin his relationships with Lincoln and TCS.   ``I'm not going to apologize for anything,'' he told thenewspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
