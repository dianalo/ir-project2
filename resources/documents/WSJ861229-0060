Lord Patrick Spens, Ansbacher's managing director, confirmed a report that he has given evidence under oath to DTI inspectors about the purchase of 2.15 million Guinness shares by Down Nominees, a subsidiary of Ansbacher, last May 6, after Guinness had won the hard-fought battle for Distillers.    A DTI spokesman declined to comment on the latest disclosures. A spokesman for Guinness, a British brewer and distiller, also declined to comment.    A spokesman for Ansbacher said the bank's decision to inform the DTI inspectors of the transactions was &quot;normal practice&quot; in light of the current investigation. Ansbacher's participation in the probe doesn't mean that it is under investigation for any wrongdoing.    But the bank's involvement and that of Down Nominees came as a surprise to bankers who had been closely involved with rival bids for Distillers from Guinness and Argyll Group PLC. Although Lord Spens once worked for Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, Guinness's main investment banker in the bid for Distillers, the bankers said Ansbacher was generally regarded as a merchant bank that was hostile to the Guinness bid.    Indeed, Lord Spens said that in April Ansbacher refused a request from Morgan Grenfell to assist in buying Guinness shares. But a short while later, he said, institutional clients of Ansbacher bought Guinness shares while its offer for Distillers, a Scottish maker of spirits, was continuing. The shares were later sold to Down Nominees, he said.    The shares -- which bankers noted were relatively small compared with the 548 million Guinness shares currently issued -- were purchased from institutional clients of Ansbacher with funds provided through Morgan Grenfell. The price was equivalent to $5.17 a share, converting the pound at its current rate -- about 73 cents more than the market price for Guinness shares at the time. A spokesman for Morgan Grenfell said that the bank couldn't comment immediately on the latest disclosures. But he confirmed that Morgan Grenfell is cooperating fully with the DTI investigation.    Bankers said the latest disclosures have added to suspicions that the DTI is investigating an illicit &quot;concert party,&quot; which was aimed at boosting the value of Guinness shares during the bid for Distillers and so insuring that its offer of five Guinness shares and $7.52 in cash for every three Distillers shares remained attractive to Distillers' shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
