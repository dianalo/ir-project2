Southwestern Bell Corp.'s net income was down 34%, mainlyreflecting a onetime charge. Bell Atlantic Corp. reported a2.1% drop, and U S West's earnings were flat.</LP><TEXT>   St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell said net fell to $172.6million, or 57 cents a share, from $262.5 million, or 87cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included aone-time charge of $80.7 million, or 27 cents a share, forthe refinancing of $732 million of long-term debt. Excludingthe charge, earnings were down 3.5%. Revenue rose 3.4% to$2.24 billion from $2.17 billion.   The company said rate reductions by federal and Texasregulators also hurt earnings. Nevertheless, Edward E.Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said thatdespite lower earnings from telephone operations, &quot;we seesolid progress in the last half of this year.&quot;   The number of customer telephone lines in service at theend of the quarter was 12.2 million, up 2.5% from 11.9million at the end of the 1990 second quarter. The company'smobile communications unit added 68,000 customers in thelatest quarter, bringing its cellular customers to 799,000, a56% rise from 513,000 at the end of June 1990.   Denver-based U S West reported net of $276.6 million, or70 cents a share, compared with $276.4 million, or 72 cents ashare. The per-share drop mainly reflects the company's May1990 offering of 16.1 million shares. Revenue rose 3.7% to$2.5 billion from $2.41 billion.   Dick McCormick, president and chief executive, said phoneoperations were essentially flat, with rate reductionsoffsetting volume increases. While certain businessesreported higher earnings, they were offset by start-up costsof international joint ventures.   U S West said its number of customer phone lines rose 3.1%to 12.7 million from 12.3 million at the end of the 1990second quarter, while its cellular subscribers increased 37%to 240,000 from 175,000.   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said net slipped2.1% to $355.1 million, or 91 cents a share, from $362.8million, or 92 cents a share. Revenue was about flat at $3.08billion; increases in its directory business andphone-related services offset declines in the company'sfinancial services businesses.   Its chairman and chief executive, Raymond W. Smith, saidcost-cutting has largely offset the effects of the recession.But while the second quarter contained &quot;some encouragingsigns,&quot; he said, &quot;we have not yet seen across-the-boardindications of economic growth.&quot;   The number of customer lines rose only 1.7% to 17.6million at the end of the quarter from a year earlier. Thenumber of cellular subscribers rose 28% to 282,800 from221,300.   The results include Bell Atlantic's portion of TelecomCorp. of New Zealand. The company said the initial publicoffering of Telecom stock, scheduled for settlementWednesday, is expected to reduce Bell Atlantic's carryingcosts on its temporary Telecom investment and will result ina gain on the sale of the shares. The gain will be recordedin the third quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
