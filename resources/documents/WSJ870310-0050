HallAnd Touche RossSued by Regulators---By Patricia Bellew GrayStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FBHFINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York State's Superintendent of Insurance charged in a lawsuit against Frank B. Hall andamp; Co. and the accounting firm Touche Ross andamp; Co. that the firms committed fraud in connection with the collapse of Union Indemnity Insurance Co.    Union Indemnity, a New York insurance concern, was a unit of Hall before being taken over by regulators in July 1985 and placed in liquidation. At the time, Union had $138.5 million in debt. Touche Ross was the unit's auditor.    The lawsuit, filed in state court here, seeks $140 million in damages. Also named in the suit were 29 former directors and officers of Union.    The suit alleges that Hall, which acquired Union in 1977, &quot;neglected and abused&quot; the unit. Hall bought the concern, intending to use it to boost its other insurance-related businesses, the suit charges.    Union's annual statements to regulators in 1982 and 1983 were &quot;false and misleading,&quot; and concealed the unit's insolvency so that it could continue to sell insurance, the suit said.    &quot;Hall should not now be permitted to walk away and leave&quot; Union's policyholders and other creditors to &quot;bear the costs of Union's losses and insolvency,&quot; the suit says. &quot;Union was managed and operated without regard to its profitability or solvency and in a manner inconsistent with prudent business practices,&quot; the suit also says.    Hall said it intends to &quot;vigorously&quot; oppose the suit. &quot;Hall has a long history and successful record of cooperating with state insurance departments, and has recently resolved complicated issues in other jurisdictions amicably and responsibly without the need for litigation,&quot; the company said.    The suit also charges the accounting firm of Touche Ross with approving false financial statements and concealing errors, among other things.    Touche Ross's auditing was performed &quot;in reckless disregard of the facts and in a reckless, careless, unskilled and negligent manner,&quot; the suit charges.    Richard Murray, general counsel of Touche Ross, said the suit &quot;is an attempt to create new law -- to ignore the traditions of corporate limited liability -- at least in the insurance industry. The additional claim against Touche Ross is even more creative and is factually insupportable, as the litigation will demonstrate.&quot;    New York Superintendent of Insurance James P. Corcoran said any funds recovered as a result of the lawsuit will benefit Union policyholders and creditors. </TEXT></DOC>
