Growing up, my parents have taught me tolove my culture, and as I have passed through some of the challenges of life,I have learned about what it means to be Hispanic. There were two particularlysignificant experiences in my life that awakened me, if you will, to thereality of prejudice and negativism toward the Hispanic community. Bothepisodes occurred rather early in my life, leaving imprints that would lastforever and that, incidentally, pushed me to obtain success.;    The firstassimilation of prejudice, for me, exploded like a lethal gas when I was inthe third grade. Prior to that boom, children of all ages and color playedalongside each other, equally unique and beautiful in everyone's eyes, or so Ithought. It seems like yesterday I was with some other children when theyreferred to a newcomer as a &quot;stupid Mexican.&quot; Never before had I heard aderogatory comment regarding race or color, let alone my own. It hit bottomand hurt not only because of the reference toward Mexicans, but also becausemy feelings weren't kept accountable for. Instead of an apology, I rememberthe words, &quot;Well, you're not like other Mexicans.&quot; I could not quite fathomthe concept. My mother was Mexican and my father was Puerto Rican. Did thatmake me only a MexiRican? I was the best student in my class, earning straightA's. I suppose these just were not the expectations for the average Hispanic.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HISPANIC  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Gisette Chamorro, who graduated this year from Pioneer High School in SanJose, is the winner of the 1991 National Hispanic Essay Contest, sponsored byHispanic magazine and Toyota. She will be awarded a $4,000 scholarship at areception at the National Press Club in Washington on July 23. She plans toattend Santa Clara University.  </MEMO><TEXT>     That was most certainly not the last time I would encounter attitudes suchas that, but from then on I was prepared to stand tall and pride myself in myheritage. Whether it was being the only child in the neighborhood to have apinata at her birthday party or bringing homemade tortillas to my classes, Ialways wanted to show the rest what it was to be Hispanic.;    The secondgreat awakening for me occurred when my parents and I were crossing the borderfrom Mexico into the United States. We were roughed up as though we were dogstrying to escape. I remember being very confused. We were just returning fromvacation when suddenly our citizenship was questioned. Was there somethingdifferent about being Mexican-American? I remember thinking, &quot;I know 'TheStar-Spangled Banner' just like everyone else.&quot; I couldn't help but think thatwe had our own individual spice just like every other American citizen. As Igrew older, I tried to regard incidences such as these as a sad reality, butnot to dwell on them. Now every chance I receive, I talk of my rich culture,which thanks to my parents, I've learned to appreciate.;    In making &quot;un pasoal futuro&quot; I have undergone certain incidences that have made me strong, thusconfident. I look forward to the opportunities of sharing my Hispanic spicewith others and thrive on success because I am able to be a role model for allthose Hispanic youngsters who may not have grown secure and determined as Ihave. Now as I hear the sound of the guitarists playing &quot;Las Mananitas,&quot; on mybirthday, I reflect on my childhood, and smile when I think of the successthat being Hispanic has encouraged me to achieve.
