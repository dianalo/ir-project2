Underwriters said two seven-year offerings met strong demand: Credit Foncier de France's $150 million of 7 1/2% bonds and Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.'s $308.1 million of 5 3/4%, yen-denominated securities.    Meanwhile, seasoned Eurodollar bonds lost 1/8 point to 1/4 point as the political storm over the Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran continued to erode the dollar.    A bond manager at a Swiss bank said an attractive yield on the Credit Foncier offering helped explain its reception. Seasoned paper carrying the French government guarantee yielded 55 to 65 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes, while yesterday's issue came at a premium of 61 basis points. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point.    Underwriters said lead manager Societe Generale was able to provide an attractive return to investors because of the linked swap to give the housing credit agency cheap French francs and European currency units.    Another dollar issue, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.'s $200 million of 8%, 10-year bonds, also generated some demand, dealers said. The triple-A/double-A bonds were launched at a margin of 78 basis points over U.S. Treasurys.    In Euroyen, where seasoned issues were largely unchanged, Nippon Telegraph's bonds rose to produce yields close to those for top sovereign names, even though the Japanese borrower no longer carries a government guarantee.    The borrower, however, saved 31 basis points compared with levels in the Japanese market, and canceled its monthly issue there as a result, said Hiroshi Toda, syndication manager at lead underwriter Nomura International Ltd., who characterized these developments as signs of maturity in the Euroyen sector.    In the floating-rate note market, dealers said they were more concerned with continuing price losses of as much as 0.30 point on their seasoned holdings than with the three new issues totaling more than $600 million.    All three of yesterday's offerings were largely specialized products rather than traditional floating-rate notes appealing to a cross-section of market investors, dealers added.    Among these issues, there were $296.7 million in notes for CMO Trust, a unit of Salomon Inc. The notes are backed by collateralized mortgage obligations of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., pay a half-point over the London interbank offered rate with a 13% cap, and carry an expected average life of 8 1/2 years.    In another triple-A issue linked to the real estate market, Parklabrea Finance Corp. issued $165 million of 12-year floating-rate notes paying a quarter-point over Libor. </TEXT></DOC>
