The device is disposed along the drive train between the vehicle motor and      the transmission. The vehicle motor rotates an engagement wheel about an      axis of rotation. The engagement wheel is frictionally engaged to a shaft      section by a clutch. The shaft section is engaged to the transmission. An      impeller is disposed about the shaft section within an impeller housing.      The impeller is free to rotate about the shaft section but the impeller      housing is affixed to the shaft section and, therefore, must rotate with      the shaft section. The impeller is linked to rotate with the engagement      wheel. The impeller housing is filled with a viscous liquid which resists      the rotation of the impeller. Thus, the drive train is protected from      over-torquing by the clutch connection between the engagement wheel and      the shaft section, but slippage under normal racing conditions is      minimized by the resistance to impeller rotation provided by the viscous      liquid. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND </PAC><PAR>  This invention is directed generally to the field of miniature motorized      racing vehicles, and, in particular, to devices for protecting the drive      trains of such vehicles. </PAR><PAR>  The racing of miniature, motorized, usually radio-controlled vehicles      (commonly termed &quot;RC&quot; vehicles) has become a very popular hobby. For some,      in fact, the racing of RC vehicles has become a serious international      sport. </PAR><PAR>  Like their full-sized cousins, a typical RC racing vehicle has a drive      train which includes a transmission. The care and upkeep of vital drive      train components has been found to be as necessary in RC vehicles as it is      in full-sized vehicles. </PAR><PAR>  In this regard, it has been found to be necessary to protect the drive      train components in an RC racing vehicle from the sudden over-torquing      caused when the vehicle bounces into the air at high speeds and then lands      back on the track again. When the vehicle leaves the ground, the sudden      lack of load on the drive wheels causes the motor to accelerate to very      high rpms. When the vehicle comes to earth again, the sudden      reintroduction of the load on the drive wheels can do serious damage to      the drive train. </PAR><PAR>  Prior art methods of protecting RC vehicle drive trains have generally      employed one or more clutch assemblies. When the drive train is suddenly      over-torqued, a clutch plate is allowed to slip within the assembly,      thereby protecting the drive train components. </PAR><PAR>  There is a problem, however, with the use of such clutch assemblies. To      adequately protect the more fragile drive train components, the slippage      threshold on the clutch plate must often be set so low that the clutch      assembly tends to slip during normal operations. The problem is most      commonly experienced during accelerations and operations at high speeds,      and can become acute after the clutch plate becomes hot. Such slippage can      severely impair the performance of the racing vehicle. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, there is a need for a practical, inexpensive device which is      capable of protecting the drive train of a miniature, motorized racing      vehicle, but which has a minimum tendency to slip under normal racing      conditions. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention satisfies these needs. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is a unique assembly disposed within the vehicle drive train.      The assembly comprises a shaft section, a rotating engagement wheel, a      clutch, and an impeller disposed within an impeller housing. </PAR><PAR>  The engagement wheel is engaged to the motor in such a way that the      rotation of the motor causes a rotation of the engagement wheel. The shaft      section is engaged to the drive wheels in such a way that the rotation of      the shaft section causes the rotation of the drive wheels. </PAR><PAR>  The clutch provides a means for frictionally engaging the engagement wheel      to the shaft section in such a way that the rotation of the engagement      wheel causes the rotation of the shaft section about its longitudinal      axis. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller is comprised of at least five vanes radiating from a central      hub. The hub is connected to the engagement wheel in such a way that the      rotation of the engagement wheel causes the rotation of the impeller about      the shaft section. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller housing is comprised of a first impeller housing moiety and a      second impeller housing moiety. One or both of the impeller housing      moieties is fixed to the shaft section so that the impeller housing      rotates with the shaft section. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, the impeller housing is filled with a viscous liquid such as      ethylene glycol. Under normal racing conditions, the operation of the      motor causes the rotation of the engagement wheel. Via the clutch linkage,      the rotation of the engagement wheel causes the rotation of the shaft      section. The rotation of the shaft section, in turn, causes the rotation      of the drive wheels. The clutch assembly is adjusted so that, whenever      there is a sudden differential in the rotating velocities of the motor and      the drive wheels, the clutch plate slips vis-a-vis the engagement wheel to      prevent damage to the drive train. Under normal racing conditions,      however, the tendency of the motor-engagement wheel-impeller moiety of the      drive train to slip relative to the drive wheel-shaft section-backing      plate moiety of the drive train is minimized by the resistance to impeller      rotation provided by the viscous liquid. </PAR><PAR>  The invention provides an inexpensive, practical method of protecting the      drive train of a miniature racing vehicle while minimizing any problem of      slippage. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention is further described below with reference to the accompanying      drawings, wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a drive train protection device having      features of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a second perspective view of the drive train protection device      FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the drive train protection device of      FIGS. 1 and 2 taken along line 3--3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an exploded view of the drive train projection device of FIGS. 1,      2 and 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a miniature racing vehicle having features      of the invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a section view taken along line 6--6, shown in partial cut-away,      of the racing vehicle of FIG. 5. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The following discussion describes in detail several embodiments of the      invention. This discussion, however, should not be construed as limiting      the invention to those particular embodiments. Practitioners skilled in      the art will recognize numerous other embodiment as well. For a definition      of the complete scope of the invention, the reader is directed to the      appended claims. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in the drawings, a vehicle 10 having features of the invention      comprises a motor 12, a transmission 14, one or more drive wheels 16, and      a drive train protection assembly (shown generally as 18). The vehicle of      the invention 10 generally weighs less than about 25 pounds and usually      less than about 7 pounds. It has a wheel base less than about 12 inches.      Its overall dimensions are usually less than about 15 inches wide and      about 20 inches long. The vehicle 10 can be radio controlled and would      thus further comprise radio receiving equipment and associated operations,      control switches and equipment (not shown). </PAR><PAR>  The motor 12 can be any of the miniature vehicle motors known in the art.      In a typical RC racing vehicle, the motor 12 is an electric motor weighing      about 6 ounces and developing power of between about 0.25 and 0.50      electrical horsepower. </PAR><PAR>  Typically, the transmission 14 is a standard transmission having 2-8 gears. </PAR><PAR>  The vehicle 10 can have one or more drive wheels 16. In the embodiment      shown in the drawings, the drive wheels 16 are provided by the pair of      wheels at the rear of the vehicle 10. </PAR><PAR>  The drive train protection assembly 18 of the invention comprises an      engagement wheel 20, a shaft section 22, clutch means for frictionally      engaging the engagement wheel to the shaft section (shown generally in the      drawings as 24) and an enclosed impeller 26. </PAR><PAR>  The engagement wheel 20 is adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 28.      In the embodiment shown in the drawings, the engagement wheel 20 is a      gear. Typically, the engagement wheel 20 is made from a nylon or other      strong plastic. Preferably, the engagement wheel 20 is      temperature-resistant to at least about 300.degree. F., more preferably,      to at least about 500.degree. F. </PAR><PAR>  A first engagement means is provided to engage the engagement wheel 20 to      the motor 12 in such a way that the rotation of the motor 12 causes the      rotation of the engagement wheel 20. In the embodiment illustrated in the      drawings, the first engagement means is provided by an engagement gear 30      disposed at the end of the motor drive shaft 32 which meshes with the gear      teeth 34 on the engagement wheel 20. </PAR><PAR>  The shaft section 22 is a short, linear shaft element having a first end      36, a second end 38, and a longitudinal axis which is co-axial with the      axis of rotation 28 of the engagement wheel 20. The shaft section 22 is      typically made from a metal, such as a steel or an alloy of aluminum. </PAR><PAR>  The clutch means 24 for frictionally engaging the engagement wheel 20 to      the shaft section 22 is provided in the embodiment illustrated in the      drawings by a backing plate 40 and a clutch pad 42. The backing plate 40      is rigidly affixed to the shaft section 22 so that the backing plate 40      rotates with the shaft section 22. The backing plate 40 can be made from      any suitable material. Plastics or metals can be used. Typically, the      backing plate 40 is made from aluminum. </PAR><PAR>  The clutch pad 42 is sandwiched between the backing plate 40 and the      engagement wheel 20. To facilitate this, the clutch pad 42 has a central      aperture 44 so that the clutch pad 42 is easily disposed around the shaft      section 22. Typically, the clutch pad 42 is between about 0.03 inches and      about 0.06 inches thick. The clutch pad 42 can be circular and have a      circular central aperture 44. In such embodiments, the difference in the      radius of the central aperture 44 and the radius of the clutch pad 42 is      typically about 3/8 inches. The clutch pad 42 can be made from natural      fibers. Typically, fibers containing mica and/or ceramic fillers are used      for better dissipation of heat. </PAR><PAR>  A second engagement means is provided for engaging the shaft section 22 to      the drive wheel 16 in such a way that the rotation of the shaft section 22      causes the rotation of the drive wheel 16. In the embodiment illustrated      in the drawings, the second engagement means is provided by (1) the      transmission 14 which is directly engaged by the shaft section 22, and (2)      a pair of rear drive wheel shafts 46 each of which is directly connected      to the transmission 14 at a first end 48 and to the drive wheels at the      opposite end 50. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller 26 is comprised of a hollow central hub 52 and at least five      evenly spaced vanes 54 of equal length. The precise shape of the vanes 54      is not critical. In the embodiment illustrated in the drawings, each of      the vanes 54 has a flat, paddle-like configuration affixed to the central      hub 52 with the flat side facing in the direction of rotation. The number      of impeller vanes 54 is also not critical. Typically, the impeller 26 has      between about 10 and about 20 vanes 54. Impellers 26 having between about      15 and about 20 vanes 54 can be used. </PAR><PAR>  Typically, the impeller 26 is less than about 4 inches in diameter. An      impeller 26 having a diameter between about 1/2 inch and about 2 inches      can be used. For typical RC racing vehicles, the impeller 26 has a      diameter between about 1 inch and about 1.5 inches. </PAR><PAR>  For strength, the vanes 54 can be interconnected by a planar web 56. As      will be discussed below, the impeller 26 is disposed within an impeller      housing 58 which is filled with a viscous liquid. For this reason, the web      56 has apertures 60 to allow the viscous liquid to flow from one side of      the web 56 to the other. Preferably, the web 56 has an aperture 60 between      each of the vanes 54. </PAR><PAR>  It is important that the impeller 26 be made from a material which is      relatively heat resistant, preferably resistant to temperatures of up to      500.degree. F. It is also important that the impeller 26 be made from: (1)      a material with a relatively high tensile strength, (2) a material which      is resistant to a chemical attack by the viscous liquid and (3) a material      one which has a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion. The      impeller 26 can be made from alloys of aluminum. For ease of manufacture,      the impeller 26 is preferably made from a polyphenylene sulfide material,      reinforced with fiberglass. A polyphenylene sulfide material reinforced      with about 40% fiberglass has been found to work well in the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller 26 is disposed within an impeller housing 58. The impeller      housing 58 is comprised of a first impeller housing moiety 62 and a second      impeller housing moiety 64. The first impeller housing moiety 62 comprises      a circular first impeller housing moiety base wall 66 and a first impeller      housing moiety side wall 68 affixed at right angles to the first impeller      housing moiety base wall 66. Likewise, the second impeller housing moiety      64 comprises a circular second impeller housing moiety base wall 70 and a      second impeller housing moiety side wall 72 affixed at right angles to the      second impeller housing moiety base wall 70. The first impeller housing      moiety base wall 66 has a first impeller housing moiety central aperture      74 and the second impeller housing moiety base wall has a second impeller      housing moiety central aperture 76. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the inside face of at least one of the impeller housing moiety      base walls 66 or 70 defines at least two, evenly spaced ridges 78      radiating from the central aperture of that base wall towards the side      wall of that moiety. Such ridges 78 provide an additional impediment to      the flow of the viscous liquid within the impeller housing 58 so as to      further inhibit the rotation of the impeller 26 when the impeller housing      58 is filled with a viscous liquid. </PAR><PAR>  The first impeller housing moiety 62 and the second impeller housing moiety      64 are sealed together at the intersection of their respective side walls      to form an impeller enclosure 80. In the embodiment illustrated in the      drawing, the first impeller housing moiety 62 and the second impeller      housing moiety 64 are connected together by self tapping screws 82 and are      sealed by a large O-ring 84, a first small O-ring 86 and a second small      O-ring 88. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the diameter of the impeller 26 is between about 0.001 inches      and about 0.005 inches less than the internal diameter of the impeller      enclosure 80. Also, it is preferable that the clearance between the      impeller vanes 54 and both the first and second impeller moiety base walls      66 and 70 is between about 0.001 inches and about 0.005 inches. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller housing 58 is affixed to the shaft section 22 so that the      impeller housing 58 rotates with the shaft section 22. The impeller 26 is      disposed within the impeller housing 58 in such a way that the impeller      hub 52 is aligned with the first and second impeller housing moiety      central apertures 74 and 76. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller hub 52 is linked to the engagement wheel 20 in such a way that      the rotation of the engagement wheel 20 causes the rotation of the      impeller 26 about the axis of rotation 28. In the embodiment illustrated      in the drawing, the impeller hub 52 protrudes through the first impeller      housing moiety central aperture 74 to attach to the engagement wheel 20. </PAR><PAR>  The impeller 26 and the engagement wheel 20 are rotatably disposed about      the shaft section 22 so that both the impeller 26 and the engagement wheel      20 can rotate freely about the shaft section 22. For this reason, in the      embodiment illustrated in the drawings, the shaft section 22 has a      circular cross-section proximate to the impeller 26 and to the engagement      wheel 20. The impeller 26 and the engagement wheel 20 are rotatably      mounted to the shaft section 22 by a first ball bearing assembly 90 and a      second ball bearing assembly 92. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment illustrated in the invention, the shaft section 22 is      keyed proximate to the backing plate 40 and to the second impeller housing      moiety central aperture 76 to accomplish the affixing of the backing plate      40 and the impeller housing 58 to the shaft section 22 in such a way that      the rotation of the shaft section 22 causes the rotation of the backing      plate 40 and the impeller housing 58. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the first impeller housing moiety 62, the impeller 26, the      second impeller housing moiety 64 and the engagement wheel 20 are slidably      affixed to the shaft section 22 so that a laterally adjustable pressure      can be applied to the clutch pad 42. In the embodiment illustrated in the      drawings, a coiled compression spring 94 is disposed about the second end      38 of the shaft section 22 to urge the first impeller housing moiety 62,      the impeller 26, the second impeller housing moiety 64 and the engagement      wheel 20 in the direction of the clutch pad 42. The coiled compression      spring 94 impinges at a first end 96 against a third ball bearing assembly      98 comprised of a first washer 100, a ball bearing unit 102 and second      washer 104. The coiled spring 94 impinges at its opposite end 106 against      a threaded cap 108. The compressive tension on the coiled spring 94 is      adjustable by the rotation of the threaded cap 108 along the second end 38      of the shaft section 22. </PAR><PAR>  The viscous liquid which is used in operation to fill the impeller housing      may be any suitable liquid having a suitable viscosity. It is preferable      that the liquid be resistant to thermal breakdown at temperatures at least      as high as 500.degree. F. It is further preferable that the viscous liquid      be non-corrosive to the impeller 26 and impeller housing 58. Finally, it      is preferable that the viscous liquid have a relatively low surface      tension so that it will not foam excessively. A glycol can be used, with      ethylene glycol being preferred. A 5 weight ethylene glycol and a 10      weight ethylene glycol have been found to have little anti-slip effect for      typical RC vehicles. However, ethylene glycol grades 20 weight through 120      weight have been found to have substantial anti-slip effect </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment illustrated in the drawings, the drive train protection      assembly 18 is operatively disposed between the motor 12 and the      transmission 14. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the drive      train protection assembly 18 can also be operatively disposed between the      transmission 14 and the drive wheels 16. Also in the embodiment      illustrated in the drawings, the engagement wheel 20 is directly connected      to the motor 12 and the shaft section 22 is directly connected to the      drive wheels 16. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the drive      train protection assembly 18 would also work if reversed (with the      engagement wheel 20 directly connected to the drive wheels 16 and the      shaft section 22 directly connected to the motor 12). </PAR><PAR>  In operation, the impeller housing 58 is filled with a viscous liquid.      Under normal racing conditions, the operation of the motor 12 causes the      rotation of the engagement wheel 20. Via the clutch assembly 24, the      rotation of the engagement wheel 20 causes the rotation of the shaft      section 22. The rotation of the shaft section 22, in turn, causes the      rotation of the drive wheels 16. The clutch assembly 24 is adjusted so      that, whenever there is a sudden differential in the rotating velocities      of the motor 12 and the drive wheels 16, the backing plate 40 slips      vis-a-vis the engagement wheel 20 to prevent damage to the drive train      components. Under normal racing conditions, however, the tendency of the      motor-engagement wheel-impeller moiety of the drive train to slip relative      to the drive wheel-shaft section-backing plate moiety of the drive train      is minimized by the resistance to impeller rotation provided by the      viscous liquid. </PAR><PAR>  The invention provides an inexpensive, practical method of protecting the      drive train of a miniature racing vehicle. With the combination of the      invention installed, the drive train of a miniature racing vehicle is      protected against over-torquing but will not appreciable slip under      ordinary racing conditions. </PAR><PAR>  Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail      with reference to certain preferred versions, many other versions should      be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the spirit and scope      of the appended claims should not necessarily be limited to the      description of the preferred versions contained herein. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
