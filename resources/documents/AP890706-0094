Dennis C. Vacco, the U.S. attorney for the Western District ofNew York, said the FBI agents on the site, about 50 miles south ofBuffalo, were looking for evidence of possible criminal violationsof federal laws governing hazardous waste storage.   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the investigation wasthe first of 17 such probes by Energy Department specialists overthe next year at federal nuclear facilities. The Energy Departmenttook over operation of the New York state-owned plant in 1980.   Last month, FBI agents raided an Energy Department nuclearweapons plants in Colorado in search of criminal violations of wastestorage laws. DOE employees were not allowed to participate in thatraid, and Moore said last week that the resulting bad publicity hadtriggered a new effort to cooperate in such probes.   Moore said ``there is currently no evidence'' of waste-handlingviolations at the New York facility, known as the West ValleyDemonstration Project.   Christina Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said the plant hasbeen operated since 1966 and currently is being decommissioned anddecontaminated. The facility, which reprocessed nuclear fuel forpower plants during the 1970s, contains an unspecified amount oflow-level, high-level and other categories of radioactive waste.   Ms. Sankey said the investigation could last several weeks. Shesaid the Environmental Protection Agency also was participating inthe investigation.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced late last month thathe had created ``tiger teams'' of department specialists to assessenvironmental compliance at all department nuclear facilities,including the nuclear weapons plants.</TEXT></DOC>
