On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled33 cents lower at $14.57 a 42-gallon barrel Friday compared withThursday's closing price of $14.90 a barrel. Other contract monthsalso settled lower.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down1.41 cents at 44.22 cents a gallon compared with 45.63 cents agallon on Thursday. The contract rose more than 3 cents onWednesday on fears of a hurricane-induced gasoline shortage.   The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.33 cents agallon to close at 41.37 cents a gallon, compared with 42.70 centson Thursday.   Analysts said the market opened lower and traded in a narrowrange Friday before weakening at the end of the day along with theprospects of a disruption in domestic gasoline and crude oilsupplies in the Gulf of Mexico.   The market had rallied earlier in the week on reports thehurricane was approaching the U.S. coastline near Texas andLouisiana and that many U.S. refineries had ceased operations.   But by Thursday, analysts said the focus shifted to productionconcerns as threats of a hurricane doing serious damage dissipated.By Friday companies which had evacuated workers from oil platformsannounced they were resuming operations.   ``Once the hurricane is off the front pages, the market will beback to looking at the supply and demand situation and I don'tthink that looks constructive,'' said William Byers, an analystwith Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Reports this week indicated the 13-member Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries had reduced its production lastmonth, from 20 million barrels a day to below 19 million, but stillmore than the market can absorb, according to analysts.   That preceded an announcement that the cartel's price monitoringcommittee would meet Sept. 25 and 26, suggesting that OPEC might beserious about setting production limits that would strengthen worldoil prices.   But on Thursday, Iraqi's oil minister slowed the market's upwardmomentum by announcing his country would not lower its oil outputand might raise its production instead.   ``That dampens any optimism about what could come out of an OPECmeeting,'' said John Azarow, an analyst with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc.   Iraq has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7million barrels a day. Some observers hoped that after a recentcease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iran, Iraq would join withother OPEC nations in restraining production.</TEXT></DOC>
