Judge James J. Rashid said Tuesday that Susan Barbier ``sunk toan intolerable level of humanity,'' and showed no potential forrehabilitation.   Barbier, 29, who could be paroled in 10 years, was convicted offirst-degree criminal sexual conduct for giving her daughter to aman who raped her twice.   Anthony Sawyer, 28, was convicted on the same charge and wassentenced by another judge Thursday to 40 to 60 years in prison.   Barbier maintained her innocence.   In a letter to Rashid dated Aug. 18, she said: ``I feel I havebeen punished enough,'' in losing her children to her ex-husband,the letter said. ``The last two years of my life has been nothingbut tragedy.''   Rashid said he imposed more than the 10 to 25 years called for insentencing guidelines because they ``don't accurately reflect thenature of this crime.''   ``Your daughter trusted you and you abused that trust beyond allbounds of decency,'' Rashid told Barbier.   ``This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact ofdrugs on innocent people,'' the Wayne County circuit judge said. ``Ihave not heard of such a situation where drugs were responsible fora mother subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.''   Sawyer testified that Barbier offered her daughter to settle adrug debt, then smoked crack with him after the attack.   Assistant Prosecutor Kelly Ramsey said Barbier's daughter calledthe May 1988 rape the worst hour of her life.   ``The child is grateful her pain is finally over,'' Ramsey saidafter Tuesday's sentencing. ``She can begin rebuilding herself.''   The victim, now 14, had written a two-page statement beforesentencing, but was too shaken to read it in court, said her father,Michael Dare.   ``She wanted to ask the judge to keep her mother in prison longenough that she can't endanger (her) younger children,'' ages 6 and8, said Dare, 33. ``She spent so much time taking care of those kidsthat she felt like a mother instead of a sister.''   Dare said he plans to lobby for legislation easing regulations ontaking children away from parents who are drug users.   Wayne County Juvenile Court granted Dare temporary custody of thevictim and her sister, 13. The two other children, who arehalf-sisters, were staying with a relative.   Although Barbier will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Rashidmust first be notified and then has authority to deny her release,Ramsey said.</TEXT></DOC>
