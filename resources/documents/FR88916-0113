On August 8,1988 the petitioners and counsel met with officials of the Department ofLabor's Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance in Washington, DC to presenttheir information.The initial findings show that Texas Eastern Exploration had domestic andforeign producing properties. The findings show that no crude oil or naturalgas was imported by Texas Eastern Exploration during the period applicableto the investigation. Further, most of the domestic producing propertieswere sold before the time of the Department's investigation. Accordingly,it was difficult to obtain the production, sales and employment recordsfor the domestic division of Texas Eastern Exploration. Corporate officialsindicated that the petitioners were employed by Texas Eastern TransmissionCorporation although their work was charged to Texas Eastern ExplorationCompany, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation.On reconsideration, the Department viewed the Texas Eastern ExplorationCompany as an appropriate subdivision and obtained sales and productiondata for natural gas and crude oil and customer data from the company.The findings show that Texas Eastern Exploration was primarily a naturalgas producer. Crude oil production in 1986 was not significant.The Department's survey shows that Texas Eastern Transmission purchasedthe major share of the natural gas produced by Texas Eastern Explorationbut had declining imports of natural gas in 1985 and 1986. A survey ofTexas Eastern Transmission's natural gas customers shows that most customersdid not import natural gas. None of the customers of Texas Eastern Transmissionreported increased natural gas imports while reducing purchases from TexasEastern Transmission. The survey also shows that none of Texas EasternTransmission customers imported crude oil.The Department's survey of Texas Eastern Exploration customers show thatnone of the customers reported increased natural gas purchases while reducingpurchases from Texas Eastern Exploration. The Survey also showed that noneof the customers of Texas Eastern Exploration imported crude oil duringthe period applicable to the petition. Accordingly the ``contributed importantly''test of the increased import criterion of the Group Eligibility Requirementsof the Trade Act of 1974 is not met.Counsel for the plaintiff argues that the Department should have used naturalgas import data for 1985 since the workers were laid off in early 1986;natural gas and crude oil imports measured in British Thermal Units (BTU)stogether show an increase in energy imports in 1985 and 1986; and, theDepartment's decision is not consistent with its determinations in theExxon cases (TA-W-19,624; TA-W-19,625 and TA-W-19,626).Since the petition does not meet the ``contributed importantly'' test counsel'sfirst two points on imports are irrelevant. The Department's determinationsin the Exxon cases are based on much different findings. Exxon Company,U.S.A. sales of crude oil decreased in the first three quarters of 1986compared to the same period of 1985 while Exxon increased its imports ofcrude oil in 1986 compared to 1985. Also, Exxon's outside customers increasedtheir imports of crude oil in 1986 while decreasing their purchases ofcrude from Exxon. Investigative findings in the instant case show thatTexas Eastern Exploration was, in effect, a captive gas supplier to TexasEastern Transmission during the period applicable to the petition. TexasEastern Transmission had decreased imports of natural gas in 1985 and 1986and did not import crude oil. Further, none of the surveyed customers ofTexas Eastern Transmission reported increased imports of natural gas whilereducing their purchases from Texas Eastern Transmission. Lastly, noneof the crude oil customers of Texas Eastern Exploration Company importedcrude oil in the period applicable to the petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After reconsideration, it is determined that Texas Eastern ExplorationCompany, Houston, Texas is an appropriate subdivision of Texas EasternTransmission Company, Houston, Texas. I reaffirm the original denial ofeligibility to apply for adjustment assistance to workers of Texas EasternTransmission Corporation and this denial of eligibility is applicable toworkers of its subsidiary, Texas Eastern Exploration Company, Houston,Texas.
