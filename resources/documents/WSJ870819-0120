An unrelated robbery takes place at a downtown bank. Both perpetrators are eventually apprehended. Their criminal records are similar -- both have prior arrests and parole violations. One offender comes before a &quot;stern&quot; judge, who sentences him to 10 years in a federal penitentiary. The other comes before a &quot;lenient&quot; judge who gives him only a five-year prison term.    Such disparities in sentencing, along with widespread dissatisfaction with the criminal parole system, prompted Congress to include sentencing reform in the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act. It created the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a permanent body charged with developing and annually revising guidelines for federal sentencing. The commission formally submitted its proposed new guidelines to Congress last April. They will take effect Nov. 1 if Congress does not enact a law disapproving them.    Under the guidelines, federal crimes would be ranked in severity from 1 to 43. Such negative factors as a prior criminal record or parole violations would add points, whereas such factors as no prior arrest record or cooperation with law-enforcement authorities and prosecutors would subtract points. Once a value was established, judges would impose a sentence within prescribed parameters. Sentences outside the parameters would require a formal explanation and such deviations would be grounds for appeal by either prosecutor or defendant. Paroles are eliminated and time off for good behavior limited.    These reforms are meant to promote &quot;truth in sentencing.&quot; A seven-year sentence would require the convict to actually serve seven years, less time off for good behavior, rather than, say, four years, the average stay now for a seven-year sentence. As a trade-off, sentences could be appealed under the new rules.    Since President Reagan pushed through this and other reforms in 1984, civil libertarians and some members of the judiciary have waged guerrilla warfare on the measures. They complain that the reforms too sharply reduce judicial discretion and argue that the federal prison system will be overloaded.    These complaints are not impressive. Greater certainty of punishment deters crime, and that will offset to some unknown degree any growth of prison populations. As to civil liberties, it is hardly fair to have wide disparities in punishment for the same crime. But the commission has responded to these pressures by suggesting to Congress that implementation of the new guidelines be postponed nine months until Aug. 1, 1988, to allow further &quot;study.&quot;    But judges who are fighting these new limits on their discretion are not on very solid ground. Under the old system, nearly half of convicted criminals were not even sentenced to prison. Of those who were given prison terms, the majority served little more than half of their original sentences before parole. Of those paroled, almost half committed new crimes or violated parole conditions.    The 1984 law would never have come into being had there not been widespread dismay over the tendency of the criminal justice system to allow dangerous criminals to escape punishment and roam the streets in search of new conquests. Postponing reforms that promise to do much to restore some balance to the system will only foment greater public antipathy toward the authorities and institutions charged with upholding laws and protecting the citizenry. </TEXT></DOC>
