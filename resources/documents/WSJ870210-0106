He is the outsider, brought in by the federal government to replace their elected leaders, purge the local of corruption and exorcise the ghost of its imprisoned boss, Anthony &quot;Tony Pro&quot; Provenzano.    &quot;The government wanted to give me FBI protection,&quot; the 68-year-old, silver-haired Mr. Jacobson says. &quot;Ridiculous. How can I walk into union meetings with three FBI guys?&quot;    The 7,800-member local, one of the largest in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was put under federal trusteeship last June after the Justice Department charged in a civil suit that it had operated under Mafia control for more than a quarter of a century. In a non-jury trial in federal court in Newark, Judge Harold Ackerman upheld the Mafia charges and ousted Local 560's executive board. Mr. Jacobson was installed as trustee for a minimum of 18 months.    The trusteeship is the first imposed on a union under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO. The President's Commission on Organized Crime last year linked 36 Teamster locals to Mafia infiltration and warned that trusteeships may be the only effective tool against the mob. In New York City, federal prosecutors are seeking a court order to clamp a trusteeship on Local 6A of the Cement and Concrete Workers union and its district council.    Failure of the Local 560 experiment would cast doubt on the efficacy of trusteeships. Judge Ackerman and Mr. Jacobson have no illusions about the difficulties ahead. Even now, the judge warns, &quot;elements&quot; of the old regime are plotting to regain power. &quot;They're there, I know it,&quot; he says. &quot;It's like squeezing dirty water out of a wash rag. There's still a lot of dirty water in that rag.&quot;    Local 560 members who oppose the old regime are afraid to do so publicly. &quot;We have nothing to gain,&quot; says a veteran truck driver. &quot;There's 20 different ways they can get rid of you. You can have an 'accident,' like getting a pipe in the head. Or they plant stuff in your truck and say you were stealing.&quot; What's more, many members doubt the trustee's willingness to stand up to employers as forcefully as the old regime seemed to. &quot;When Jacobson came in,&quot; a New Jersey truck company official says, &quot;many of our {Local 560} guys were angry. Their initial reaction was that the government's coming in and the companies will totally have their way.&quot;    From 1958 to 1984, Local 560 was bossed by Mr. Provenzano, a reputed member of the Vito Genovese crime gang, and his two brothers, Salvatore and Nunzio Provenzano. The three are currently in federal prison for crimes committed while serving as Local 560 officers. During their reign, two Local 560 dissidents were murdered, union funds were misused, former convicts were put on the payroll, and officers took illegal kickbacks from employers in return for labor peace and &quot;sweetheart contracts&quot; calling for reduced wages.    Even so, Tony Provenzano's hold on the members of Local 560 remains strong. &quot;Tony Pro was a Robin Hood to them,&quot; says a dissident in the local. &quot;Because of Tony Pro, there were medical benefits and good wages. Whatever he may have done that the government charges him with,&quot; he adds, the union members &quot;remember that he took care of them.&quot;    No stranger to unions, Mr. Jacobson was an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in the late 1940s. For the next 25 years, he was a leader, successively, of the New Jersey CIO, the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers.    He was also among the first to urge Brendan Byrne to make his successful 1974 bid for the New Jersey governorship. After that, Mr. Jacobson headed the state's public utility commission and then its energy department. &quot;Bored silly&quot; as a member of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, he says, he quit to become Local 560's $71,000-a-year trustee.    His first -- and virtually only -- priority has been to win the confidence of the members. With obvious delight, he relates that some rank-and-filers last Christmas invited him to a party at a terminal. &quot;I didn't want to speak, but they dragged me to the mike,&quot; he says. &quot;After I spoke, they gave me an ovation.&quot;    He says that he typically gets up at 5 a.m. so that he can get to the freight terminals where the men are. &quot;I try to resolve problems,&quot; he says. &quot;Ackerman's decision to select a union man -- not necessarily me -- was a wise choice. If he had put in, say, a former U.S. prosecutor or former attorney general, that would have guaranteed defeat for the trusteeship.&quot;    On a recent morning, Mr. Jacobson met with 15 union members at the offices of Brinke Transportation in Jersey City. Stressing that he had no hidden motives, he told the men: &quot;I'm not running for office, and I'm not sponsoring anybody. I look forward to the day when I can play with my two grandchildren.&quot;    He also regaled his audience with an account of his response to a firing last year by Conway-Eastern Express in Jersey City. A Teamster, Dominick Romano, was dismissed because of what Mr. Jacobson calls &quot;trumped-up charges&quot; that he had someone else punch his time card for him. The firing cost Mr. Romano his non-paying post as an elected Teamster shop steward at Conway-Eastern.    When the company refused Mr. Jacobson's entreaties to rehire Mr. Romano, the trustee decided to play hardball. He hired Mr. Romano as a salaried business agent in charge of Teamster matters at Conway-Eastern. &quot;The company went wild,&quot; Mr. Jacobson says gleefully. &quot;They recanted the allegations and reinstated Mr. Romano.&quot; Conway-Eastern declines to comment on the incident.    To show his decisiveness, Mr. Jacobson says he dumped a law firm employed by Local 560 that charged some members &quot;unauthorized administrative fees&quot; for legal services. Moreover, he says, his trusteeship has won pay increases in some new contracts. And he is expanding the availability of dental and vision care.    But his foes are unimpressed. Over drinks in a back room of a Union City tavern, a group of shop stewards vent their feelings.    Says Anthony Valdner, employed at TNT Freight: &quot;A trusteeship is a waste of time and money. I want my officers back.&quot; James Bartolomeo, of Carolina Freight, says employers are trying to take advantage of what they see as weakness. &quot;Since June 23 {when Mr. Jacobson became trustee} we've got five grievances {against the company},&quot; he says. &quot;In the three years prior to Jacobson, no grievances.&quot;    Nunzio Spano, of Pacific Intermountain Express, scoffs at the notion that rank-and-filers are afraid to speak out. &quot;I've been a shop steward 11 years,&quot; he says. &quot;I run every year.&quot; Noting that he was reelected in June by a vote of 79 to 29, Mr. Spano adds, &quot;They can vote any way they like.&quot; His fellow members at Pacific Intermountain, in Moonachie, N.J., crowd around. &quot;I been in this local 36 years,&quot; an angry Ed Taglieri says. If the government thought the local was being intimidated, he adds, &quot;why didn't they ask us, 'Do you want a change?' We weren't asked!&quot;    Shop steward Valdner, who wears a baseball cap inscribed &quot;Free 560,&quot; says that when a petition demanding that Judge Ackerman permit immediate Local 560 elections was circulated early last year, &quot;5,300 people signed it. Nobody was intimidated, coerced or threatened.&quot; But a dissident, asked about the petition, says: &quot;They shoved it in front of you. They watched to see if you'd sign it.&quot;    The shop stewards provide a powerful base of support for the old leadership, says an official of a company employing Local 560 drivers and warehousemen. &quot;The guys know it's not in their interest to antagonize the shop steward,&quot; the official says. &quot;If a guy is facing a discharge, a discharge will occur by the steward's lack of support. Or, if a guy is facing disciplinary action, it'll be a lot harsher if he doesn't have the steward's support. It's a big fact of life.&quot;    For union dissidents, another fact of life is the local's long history of violence. Tony Provenzano drew a life sentence in 1978 for ordering the 1961 murder of a Local 560 rival, Anthony Castellitto. Mr. Provenzano is to serve that sentence after a 20-year term for taking illegal payoffs from employers.    Walter Glockner, a member, was murdered in 1963, one day after denouncing a Provenzano crony at a membership meeting. No one was indicted for the crime.    In 1983, August Muller, another member, criticized Salvatore Provenzano, then Local 560's president, in the presence of 300-pound Stanley &quot;Stosh&quot; Jaronko, who at that time was a member of the local's executive board. Mr. Jaronko, according to testimony at the 1983 trusteeship trial, then struck Mr. Muller, who was 58 and had a heart condition, and knocked him against a wall. Mr. Jaronko's attorney says that his client merely pushed Mr. Muller and wasn't aware of his illness.    Mr. Muller was exceedingly reluctant to discuss the incident as a government witness at the trusteeship trial. He was &quot;in the grip of extreme fear,&quot; Judge Ackerman said in his decision ousting the executive board.    The Provenzanos last faced opponents in local elections in 1962 and 1965, says Raymond Wren, a Labor Department special agent in Newark. Many of those opponents suffered economic retaliation, Mr. Wren says. &quot;They were fired and weren't adequately defended by the union.&quot;    Local 560 has contracts with more than 300 employers. Its members include office and factory workers, but drivers and warehousemen predominate, and it is from them that the Provenzanos drew their support.    In 1978, after his murder conviction, Tony Provenzano resigned as secretary-treasurer of Local 560. He was succeeded by Josephine Provenzano, his 23-year-old daughter. Josephine, who had been a Local 560 office worker, was elected -- by the unanimous vote of more than 1,000 members -- to a job that paid $64,000 a year and included a white Lincoln as a perquisite. Miss Provenzano, in testimony at the trusteeship trial, said she told her father that the standing ovation she received after her election was for him. &quot;Don't think I am dumb enough to think it was for me,&quot; she told him.    Tony and Nunzio Provenzano are barred by court order from any future association with Local 560; Nunzio is serving a 10-year term for a 1981 kickback conviction. Salvatore Provenzano, who drew a three-year term in 1984 after conviction in a kickback conspiracy, is prohibited by law from seeking union office until five years after he is freed from prison.    If elections were held today, Michael Sciarra, a member of the ousted executive board, would be the clear favorite to win the presidency. Says a Teamster at Pacific Intermountain Express: &quot;Mikey Sciarra knows my name and knows my family. When there's a problem, Mikey's there.&quot;    Conceding Mr. Sciarra's strong following, Mr. Jacobson says: &quot;I've seen Sciarra come into the barn and members come up and kiss him and hug him.&quot;    Mr. Sciarra received the most votes -- 2,062 -- of any of the 10 delegates from Local 560 who helped reelect Jackie Presser, the Teamsters national president, at the 1986 union convention. The meeting at which Mr. Sciarra was elected a delegate was &quot;like a circus,&quot; a Teamster recalls. &quot;These were full-grown men, stomping their feet, chanting, 'Mikey, Mikey,' over and over.&quot;    The 51-year-old Mr. Sciarra makes no secret of his admiration for Tony Provenzano. &quot;I don't know anything bad about the guy,&quot; he says. &quot;He was great for labor. He might be a tough guy, but that's what this union is.&quot;    Mr. Sciarra was the local's interim president, appointed by the board after the 1984 jailing of Salvatore Provenzano and forced to vacate when Mr. Jacobson became trustee. His role in Local 560 came under sharp scrutiny during the trusteeship trial. In the early 1980s, Mr. Sciarra handled contract and grievance matters for hundreds of Local 560 members, including drivers employed by Canny Trucking Co. in Elizabeth, N.J. Federal prosecutor Thomas Weisenbeck charged in court that during this period, Canny was using nonunion drivers supplied by a New Jersey trucking firm headed by Mr. Sciarra's longtime friend, Fred Furino. The prosecutor called this a violation of Canny's contract with Local 560.    Mr. Sciarra said that he wasn't aware of Canny's actions until Mr. Furino's death in 1982 and that he warned Canny never to use nonunion drivers again. Canny declines to comment.    Some of Mr. Jacobson's supporters fault him for failing to denounce corruption. &quot;He's got to make the guys wake up, show them what's going on,&quot; says one. Otherwise, says another, &quot;Mikey Sciarra's a shoo-in. And when he gets back, it'll be the same old story.&quot;    Another sore point is Mr. Jacobson's decision to keep Joseph Sheridan, a vice president of the ousted board, on the union payroll. In his decision, Judge Ackerman characterized Mr. Sheridan as &quot;decent, devoted, blind and bought.&quot; Arthur L. Fox, a Washington attorney who has represented Teamster dissidents, says that retaining Mr. Sheridan &quot;strikes the wrong message to the rank and file, if you're expecting real leaders to come out of the woodwork to clean up the union.&quot;    Mr. Jacobson cites &quot;humanitarian&quot; reasons for keeping Mr. Sheridan, who will be eligible for a union pension in five or six months. As for denouncing corruption, Mr. Jacobson says it would be poor strategy. &quot;You force all the Sciarra loyalists to come to his defense,&quot; he says. &quot;The candidate running against Sciarra -- that's the guy who should be scoring points, not me.&quot;    But so far, no one has come forward to challenge Mr. Sciarra. Will Judge Ackerman permit an election if Mr. Sciarra is the sole candidate? &quot;I'll jump off that bridge when I come to it,&quot; he says.    Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who was a government witness at the trusteeship trial, says that free elections are a pipe dream until dissidents feel so secure that they &quot;are willing to talk to reporters and let their names be used.&quot; Rank-and-filers backing Mr. Jacobson say it's ridiculous to believe that free elections can be held by year-end, as planned. &quot;To undo what's been done will take three to four years,&quot; says one. &quot;By then, the fear may be gone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
