Michael Aoun reportedly pressed for apullout within six months.   The 63 legislators were meeting in this western mountain resortto try to end 14 years of civil war. Anti-Syrian Sunni Moslemlegislators supported the Christian pullout demands, deepening thedeadlock as the deliberations moved into their second week.   The Maronite Catholics, the dominant Christian sect in Lebanon,want a pledge for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops fromLebanon before they will agree to political reforms that would giveMoslems an equal share of power.   The Arab League, which sponsored the conference, has suggested aSyrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of Beirut within two years tothe Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. After that,Damascus would negotiate on troop levels with a new Lebanesegovernment.   Lebanon has been ruled by two rival governments _ one Moslem andone Christian _ since September 1988.   The Syrian-backed Moslems have insisted there can be no pulloutuntil the Christians agree to the reforms.   Conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity saidAoun, a Maronite, is pressing for a Syrian pullout within sixmonths.   A Sunni Moslem lawmaker, Abdul-Majid Rafi'e of the northernSyrian-controlled port of Tripoli, told reporters that the Syriansshould at least withdraw from Beirut before a parliamentary sessionscheduled there for later this month to elect a new Lebanesepresident.   Many Lebanese Sunnis oppose the Syrian presence in their nation,although they are powerless to do anything about it because theyhave no military muscle.   For the second straight day, no formal sessions were scheduledSaturday as Arab League mediators sought to find a compromise tobreak the impasse.   Conference sources said a full session of the 33 Christian and30 Moslem parliamentarians will not be held until a compromise isreached.   Saudi Arabian, Moroccan and Algerian mediators, who comprise theArab League committee on Lebanon, sought international support forcompromise proposals and had intensive contacts with U.S., Soviet,French and Iraqi envoys, the sources reported.   The Soviet Union is Syria's main ally and also has close linkswith Iraq. France has historic links with the Maronites.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been arming Aoun to help himconfront Damascus in an attempt to thwart Syrian ambitions inLebanon.   However, all these outside powers have supported the ArabLeague's peacemaking effort.   Syrian forces moved into Lebanon in 1976, the year after thecivil war broke out, under a peacekeeping mandate by the 22-memberArab League.   Aoun claims the Syrians abrogated that mandate by openly sidingwith Lebanon's Moslems.   The Arab League peace plan announced last month hinges on theChristians surrendering some of their privileges. The Christianshave dominated the government, parliament, judiciary and army sinceindependence from France in 1943.   Along with a phased Syrian withdrawal leading to a security pactbetween Damascus and a united Lebanese government, the plan alsocalls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces occupying a border stripin southern Lebanon.   Syria, which considers Lebanon to be vital to its strategicdefense against Israel, has linked any troop withdrawal to anIsraeli pullout and political reforms.   Most Moslem lawmakers and some pro-Syrian Christians favor theArab league blueprint.   They contend the Syrians are the only force powerful enough tokeep Lebanon's unruly militias in check and maintain order in thewar-ravaged Mediterranean country.   Despite the differences, the meeting has made some progress.   The lawmakers have agreed to divide seats in Lebanon's NationalAssembly equally between the two sides. Since 1943, the Christianshave had a 6-5 edge.   They were considered to be the majority in 1943. But Moslems nowform an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population.   The 99-seat parliament was last elected in 1972. Twenty-fivelegislators have died or been killed since then and formerPresident Amin Gemayel's seat has been vacant since he was electedin 1982. Ten of the surviving legislators are not attending theTaif talks.</TEXT></DOC>
