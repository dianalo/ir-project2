If the Paris-based agency's forecast is accurate, it willmark the first significant annual gain after three years ofnearly flat world oil demand.</LP><TEXT>   In its first projection for 1992, the agency estimatedpetroleum demand should average 66.8 million barrels a dayfor the full year. That would be up 500,000 barrels a dayfrom 1991.   Most of the increase is expected in the 24-nationOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, orOECD. The IEA, which represents these Western nations, saidthat 1992 OECD oil demand is projected to increase by 400,000barrels a day to 38.3 million barrels a day, with most of thegrowth coming in North America.   Also, in its monthly oil market report released yesterdayin Paris, the IEA said that as expected, fourth-quarter OECDoil demand is estimated to have climbed by one millionbarrels a day over the year-earlier level. Most of thefourth-quarter growth was in Europe, according to the IEAfigures.   The IEA expects world oil demand to be up in every quarterin 1992. But the agency has again revised downward its firstquarter estimate because of a slower than previously expectedrecovery in the economies of some major oil-consuming nationssuch as the U.S.   The IEA now forecasts first-quarter demand at 67.8 millionbarrels a day. That is higher than the 67.6 million of theyear-earlier quarter but still is 300,000 barrels a day lessthan had been projected in the IEA's December report.   &quot;This could provide more ammunition for OPEC oil ministerswho are expected to push at their Feb. 12 meeting for a cutin the organization's output in a bid to defend prices,&quot;reported Energy Compass, a London-based oil industrypublication, in an analysis of the IEA figures.   &quot;A lot depends on that meeting,&quot; agreed William Randol, aninternational oil analyst with First Boston Corp. Hispetroleum demand projections are in line with those of theIEA, and he says they underscore the need for theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to makesignificant production cuts. If not, he said, West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, &quot;could break $15 abarrel until OPEC gets its act together.&quot; A similar type ofcrude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange closedyesterday at $18.47 a barrel.   In its supply figures, the IEA estimated that productionby OPEC edged up to 24.2 million barrels a day fromNovember's 24.1 million. Its figures also suggest thatrequirements for oil from OPEC and world inventories willtotal 24.6 million barrels a day in the first quarter. Butthis requirement will drop to 22.7 million barrels a day inthe second quarter when world oil demand slackens seasonallyto 65.2 million barrels a day, according to the IEAestimates.   The agency estimated oil production in the former SovietUnion averaged 10.4 million barrels a day in 1991 but wasdown to 10 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter. TheIEA expects the former union's 1992 oil output to average 9.5million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
