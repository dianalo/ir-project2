It maybe desirable to replace many of these generators with renewable energysystems, such as wind or photovoltaic systems. Improved reliability anddecreased operating costs could result in those places where the renewableresources are sufficiently abundant and diesel operation is expensive.Attempting to determine the cost effectiveness of hybrid renewable systemsrequires a design strategy based on the load, storage (or back up energyrequirements), and data for the local renewable source inputs. This paperdescribes a method using linear programming principles and monthly averageresource and load data to arrive at an optimal mix of wind and photovoltaicsfor system design. Storage or back up requirements are estimated by anumerical simulation of several TMY (&quot;Typical Meteorological Year&quot;) siteswith hourly data that relate system reliability and storage size. Thesefactors are then combined to give a total system cost and reliabilityestimate for comparison with existing systems.</TEXT></DOC>
