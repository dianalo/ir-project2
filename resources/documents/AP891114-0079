Also today, East Germany's new premier called for a coalitiongovernment but gave no indication the opposition will be part init, despite widespread protests pressing for an end to theCommunist monopoly on power.   Hans Modrow, considered a reformer, also said the Berlin Wall,though open to travel, must remain standing to keep AIDS, crime andother Western problems out of his Communist country, a newspapersaid today.   A leader of East Germany's biggest opposition group, New Forum,said today that the movement could work with a revamped CommunistParty but that naming Modrow premier was not enough.   Also today, the official East German news agency ADN reportedthat the government was considering opening part of the Berlin Wallnear the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage between East andWest Berlin. The gate, a huge columned monument, is one of thecity's best-known symbols.   Before East Germany opened its borders, the gate had been amajor rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel tothe West.   Since the opening of East Germany's borders last week, there hasbeen growing speculation and concern about the implications for theEast German and West German economies.   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, in announcingthe aid package today, compared his conditional offer to theMarshall Plan put together by the United States to help Europerecover from World War II destruction.   Haussmann did not name a figure for the proposed aid, and saidthe plan would be useless if East Germany did not carry out a``thorough change'' of its troubled centrally planned economy.   Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Haussmann said reforms promisedby East Germany's new Communist Party leader Egon Krenz had so farled to more questions than answers.   The minister said the aid plan being offered by Bonn wouldinclude massive investments in East Germany and joint ventures, aswell as revamping East Germany's outdated communications andtransport system.   East Germany's Communist governments in the past have flatlyruled out free-market principles in the Socialist state.   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper urged the federal government tomeet with East German officials to discuss ``pressing economicproblems'' created by the sudden opening of East Germany's borders.   Among the issues mentioned by Momper were currency problems,traffic and other economic problems.   Modrow was chosen Monday in a session of unprecedentedliveliness in East Germany's Parliament. Lawmakers, longsubservient to the Communist leadership, voted by secret ballot forthe first time and endorsed opposition calls for free elections.They also elected their first non-Communist Parliament speaker.   Some deputies even called for stripping the constitution of aclause that designates the country ``socialist.''   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschlandacknowledged today the country is in a ``deep crisis,'' but isexperiencing an ``awakening'' leading toward change.   Modrow, 61, is an anti-establishment Communist figure who builthis power base from his former position as Dresden's CommunistParty chief. He replaced Willi Stoph, who resigned last week alongwith his entire 44-member Cabinet.   The new premier supports step-by-step economic reforms,including the scaling down of East Germany's ponderous governmentbureaucracy.   Still, Modrow said the government has no intention of tearingdown the Berlin Wall, despite carving new passages through it forthe past five days in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees andgrowing public unrest.   ``In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases ofAIDS and drugs are virtually unknown. Our people are askingthemselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is,'' WestGermany's Bild newspaper quoted Modrow as saying.   He said doing away with the barrier completely could cause``chaos,'' echoing the Communist line that the wall was designed toprotect East Germany from threats of the West.   Modrow is to present his Cabinet on Friday. The official ADNnews agency quoted him as saying Monday night that the countryneeds a ``real coalition government.''   ``This will naturally be a broader cooperation within ouralliance,'' he said, referring to four small Communist-alignedparties that have had Cabinet positions in the past but neverimportant ones.   There was no indication he intended to offer Cabinet ministriesto opposition leaders.   The election of Modrow came as hundreds of thousands ofdemonstrators gathered around the nation, spurred by last week'sopening of East Germany's borders with the West. They shoutedanti-Communist slogans and demanded an end to the party's monopolyon power.   In the city of Leipzig, about 300,000 people paraded through thestreets in what has become a Monday night ritual, chanting ``We arethe people!'' Protesters shouted `Lazy bunch!'' outside the localheadquarters of the secret police.   Juergen Tallig, the Leipzig spokesman for New Forum, told WestGermany's Hesse state radio today, ``I can imagine cooperating witha reformed Communist party.''   He praised Modrow as a ``competent politician'' but said,``There are still too many people in top positions with whomdialogue is not possible.''   Krenz permanently opened East Germany's borders Friday in anattempt to stop hundreds of thousands of East Germans from fleeingWest and to buy time for his promised reforms.   The gamble appears to have paid off. The official ADN newsagency reported that more than 5 million visas had been issuedsince Thursday, but that only about 10,000 people applied toemigrate.   Monday's frequently uproarious parliamentary session was thefirst translation of East Germany's euphoria into concretepolitical action.   During the meeting, some parliamentarians blamed the previousparty and state leadership for the economic and social morass thathas engulfed this nation of 16.5 million.   Party leader Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 at the height ofthe exodus, and there have been calls for the entire party CentralCommittee to step down.   The new speaker of Parliament is Guenther Maleuda. TheCommunists did not field a challenger to his candidacy. Maleudaheads the Democratic Peasants, one of four non-Communist partiesthat had been allowed to exist in exchange for accepting Communistsupremacy.</TEXT></DOC>
