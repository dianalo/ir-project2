Gen. Chavailit Yongchaiyudh told reporters at Supreme CommandHeadquarters that he had no knowledge of any alleged corruption. Hesaid the charges, first reported in The Washington Post Sunday, havehurt morale in the army.   ``The Washington Post must reveal more details to back thoseallegations because it is irresponsible to talk lightly of somethingas accusatory as this,'' he said. ``That, or go to hell.''   Chavalit said he has ordered an investigation, but added that hedoubted anything could be proven because he said the Americanshandle the financial administration of the aid program.   ``If any U.S. official can identify the culprits, come tell us,''he said. ``But if he knows but won't come forth, then we cannot workwell together and cannot call ourselves friends.''   Other Thai officers have denied there was any corruption.   The program is operated by CIA officers in Thailand, which theguerrillas use as sanctuary and support in fighting Vietnamesetroops that invaded Cambodia in late 1978. The money is funneled tothe guerrillas at least in part through the Thai military.   The aid, in the form of non-lethal items and training, goes tothe forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and former Prime Minister SonSann and is intended to strengthen their position relative to thethird guerrilla group, the communist Khmer Rouge. The latter groupkilled hundreds of thousands in Cambodia before Vietnam invaded.   The aid program has since been cleaned up but is operating atreduced levels, U.S. officials in Washington say.   The Washington Post report said CIA officers in Thailand firstturned up evidence earlier this year that money had been skimmed offfrom the program, which totaled $12 million in fiscal 1988. An auditteam dispatched to Thailand by the Senate Intelligence Committeeconfirmed the scheme.   The team's report to the intelligence panel on July 12 sparkeddisagreement over whether the covert support should be continued,The Post reported.   At the time, the United States was seeking to increase the aidprogram.   It was decided to reduce the amount of U.S. support to $8 millionin the current year and to institute strict accounting procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
