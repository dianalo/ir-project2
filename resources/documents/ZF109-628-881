 Such efforts have ledto reductions in the time required to evaluate purchase requestsat NASA, and improved software screening at Farmers Home.andP;  The keyto a successful quality control program is instating the newprogram into the systems development process rather than merely asa guidance system that might be ignored.andP;  Testing is part of thequality control process, in addition to a clear elaboration ofrequirements and deadlines.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Quality ControlInformation Resources ManagementGovernment AgencyInformation SystemsSystemsTesting.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Struggle for Quality Pays Off In Government IRM ProgramsandM;There are no short cuts for federal IRM managers trying to establishaggressive quality assurance programs in their agencies.andP;  But reports frommany federal officials indicate that the payoff is worth the struggle.andM;For example, technology review efforts at NASA's Johnson Space Center inHouston led to systems that reduced the time it takes to evaluate purchaserequests by 57 percent.andM;Over at the Farmers Home Administration, officials have bolstered internalcontrols by screening all software distributed to the agency's 2,300 state,district and county field offices.andM;And at the Internal Revenue Service's Cincinnati Service Center, officialshave used the service's electronic filing system to improve the accuracy ofincome tax returns processing.andP;  By altering batch processing and tighteningwork cycles, the center reduced processing errors from 16 percent to 3percent.andP;  The interest paid to taxpayers dropped from $1.6 million in 1988 to$195,000 in 1989.andP;  But several IRM officials warned that successful programshinge on transforming quality control measures into agency policy, not simplyguidance.andP;  Agencies must make testing and quality control measures part ofthe systems development process, they said.andM;&quot;We have to spell out system requirements and set performance deadlines.andP;  Bthe time we've finished testing, we should have the problems sorted out,&quot;said Mark Boster, FmHA's assistant administrator of automated informationservices.andP;  &quot;We have to educate people about the importance of quality and putthe responsibility on our division directors and IRM managers.&quot;andM;&quot;We try to identify software problems before we begin, and it really pays bigdividends,&quot; said Ronald Nervitt, assistant commissioner of informationsystems in Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS).andP;  &quot;It's a tough jobbecause people don't get the kind of respect or recognition they deserve.andO;But they should, because it's a vital function.&quot;andM;Boster said FmHA has established a systems testing laboratory in Washingtonwhere members of the quality assurance branch can duplicate any field officeenvironment.andP;  All FmHA offices use ATandamp;T co. 3B2 minicomputers for wordprocessing, spreadsheet functions and tracking programs.andM;The hardware configurations, however, vary, and agency officials want to besure all off-the-shelf and custom programs meet user demands.andM;Boster said FmHA tests software in three stages, with developers doing theinitial system tests.andP;  Then representatives from the field offices andquality assurance branc do acceptance tests in the lab, where they simulateoffice functions and check for speed, accuracy and reliability.andP;  They alsoreview all documentation and training requirements.andM;Pilot TestsandM;During the final phase, members of the quality assurance staff run pilottests at four to six field offices.andM;They train the users and handle start-up problems.andM;&quot;Every single piece of software undergoes a test.andP;  If we find problems thenthat means we've done our jobs,&quot; Boster said.andP;  &quot;The test scripts varyaccording to user requirements, but there's a basic strategy and standard.andO;By the time we get through testing, the problems should be shaken out.andP;  Onceyou're done, there's no going back.andP;  You're committed.&quot;andM;Boster said the agency eventually wants to distribute software electronicallyusing the Agriculture Department's IBM Corp. mainframe computers at itsKansas City data center.andP;  He said the data center has an exemplary qualityassurance program and his staff is finishing work on standart testprocedures.andM;But electronic distribution will require more communications lines to fieldoffices and configuration management tools.andM;&quot;It's a matter of getting a common standard.andP;  When you're dealing with about2,300 field offices, you're bound to get variations,&quot; Boster said.andP;  &quot;We'relooking toward electronic distribution of software that will reduce errorsand verify how we install it.andP;  It all leads to a tighter configurationmanagement program.&quot;andM;At FMS, Nervitt said, quality assurance teams review every system developmentproject.andM;The teams consist of computer specialists and program managers with extensiveADP experience, including work with fourth-generation programming languages.andO;Much of the job involves adapting software to FMS' environment, whichincludes IBM 3081 and 4381 computers at the service's National Data Center inHyattsville, Md.andM;The teams use agency standards for stress tests and system response times.andO;They also examine all user documentation.andM;The teams have worked on major projects such as the redesign of FMS' CentralFinancial Management System known as STAR, and the FMS System 90 project.andM;Although a quality assurance team is assigned to every project, Nervitt saida team's influence depends on its being an independent audit group.andM;&quot;They work as a team but serve as independent assessors,&quot; Nervitt said.andP;  &quot;Ifthere are problems, you have to have a change control process.andP;  You have tokeep the integrity, and that means being separated from the developmentorganization.&quot;andM;Nervitt said no FMS system is approved until a quality assurance teamverifies it meets all user requirements.andP;  Systems with minor glitches may bepassed provided that problems can be corrected easily.andP;  But those decisionsare made by the teams.andM;&quot;If there are discrepancies that aren't critical, then we will make surethey're cleaned up later.andP;  But before any final approval, the project needs ateam's certification,&quot; Nervitt said.andP;  &quot;If the quality assurance is poor theneverybody loses.andP;  If it's good, then everyone comes out a winner.&quot;andM;Audit ReviewsandM;Meanwhile, other agencies are trying to boost quality by integratingmandatory systems audit procedures into comprehensive review program.andP;  Forexample, officials at Agriculture's National Finance Center do all securityand internal controls checks while drafting their annual five-year financialsystems plan.andP;  Larry Wilson, director of Agriculture's Office of Finance andManagement, said the plan contains all the ADP program and managementcontrols data required by OMB.andP;  He said combining the reviews ensures allinternal controls are evaluated.andM;&quot;We've made an attempt to meet our requirements under one process andeliminate overlaps,&quot; Wilson said.andP;  &quot;At the end of the year we pull togetherall this information and publish the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Actreport regarding our controls.andP;  We're probably the most audited organizationin government.&quot;andM;OMB is relying on these kinds of programs to salvage 112 &quot;high-risk&quot; agencyprograms and to avoid further financial scandals, like last year's debacle atthe Housing and Urban Development Department.andP;  OMB Director Richard G. Darmanhas attributed many agency internal control problems to obsolete andunreliable systems.andM;OMB officials have recommended agencies adopt quality improvement models likethe one at Johnson Space Center to develop stronger management controls.andP;  Thecenter, designated as a 1990 quality prototype, re-designed its procurementprocess and established a technology management system to identify priorityprojects and coordinate management activities.andM;OMB also created the Federal Quality Institute to help agencies developquality improvement strategies.andP;  But the institute does not offer specificADP advice.andM;&quot;We offer a general program on the whole issue,&quot; said Ira Jekowsky, one ofthe institute's senior quality executives.andP;  &quot;Our role is to serve asfacilitators, so we have to stay general.andP;  We can help provide start upservices and develop a vision statement.andP;  But we really need to develop morecase study examples of how others have done it for ADP.&quot;andM;Jimmie Brown, chief of OMB's Financial Systems and Policy Branch, saidagencies should consult the Joint Financial Management Improvement Project'sstandards on internal controls and edits.andP;  The standards are part of JFMIP'score requirements for government financial systems.andM;Brown said the standards can help agencies devise methods for trackinginformation and improving records management.andP;  But the key to any qualityimprovement program is strong internal controls, he said.andM;&quot;We at OMB don't have a technical staff to issue advice.andP;  But there's a lotof expertise at the department levels,&quot; Brown said.andP;  &quot;Quality is inherent inupgrading and building financial systems.andP;  The whole purpose is to ensureaccuracy, and that means a good internal controls structure.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
