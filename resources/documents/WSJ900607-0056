Although Brent blend crudes traded on the InternationalPetroleum Exchange in London were down as much as 15 cents abarrel, prices of fuels and crude oil were generally strongerin both spot and futures markets in Europe and the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   In U.S. futures trading, prices were higher across theenergy complex. The July crude contract on the New YorkMercantile Exchange rose 24 cents a barrel to settle at$16.92, near the $17 level that many traders consider to betechnically important. The August crude contract settled 18cents higher at $17.57.   These gains were hardly enough to offset the sharp dropsof Monday and Tuesday or the erosion of nearly $7 a barrelthat has taken place since the year's prices peaked inJanuary. But to a few traders they suggested a possibleturnaround in oil markets.   &quot;They probably signaled that the market has bottomed out,&quot;said Neil Chandi, president of Crescent InternationalPetroleum Ltd.   But oil prices still are subject to the course ofproduction by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries. &quot;All really depends on what happens between nowand mid-June,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-basedconsultant on OPEC affairs.   Mr. Karbassioun estimated that OPEC output dropped 300,000to 400,000 barrels a day in May from the April level. Helooks for a similar decline this month based on preliminaryestimates.   That would suggest OPEC output for June of around 23million to 23.2 million barrels a day. That would be downnearly one million barrels a day from the peak production of24 million barrels a day earlier this year. Although OPECagreed in early May to curb quota cheating and reduceproduction by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day, several oilministers conceded they expected cuts totaling one millionbut that amount should be sufficient to satisfy jittery oilmarkets.   But will it be enough to satisfy Saudi Arabia? The kingdomhas insisted it will continue to adhere to its quota of 5.4million barrels a day. But Saudis are known to be impatientwith Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, chronicoverproducers. Unless these two reduce output, the Saudisaren't likely to continue producing within their quota muchbeyond the late-July date of the next OPEC meeting.   At the opening of futures trading yesterday, oil pricesappeared to be continuing to plunge because of largeincreases in crude oil and fuel inventories reported lateTuesday by the American Petroleum Institute. The July crudecontract hit a low of $16.33 a barrel before turning up.   A late Tuesday statement by the Saudi oil minister, HishamNazer, that the kingdom would continue respecting its quotaas promised was a contributing factor in yesterday's rally.Also helping firm prices were rumors that a large cloud inthe Soviet Union was radioactive, but the reports have beendiscounted.   Also, there were rumors that an emergency meeting of OPECwould be called to deal with the price and productionproblems. But a senior OPEC official said: &quot;I've heard therumors, but I'm not aware of any such meeting.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: The price of soybean futurescontracts rose on an early buying flurry because of rumorsthat a potentially radioactive cloud was passing over theSoviet Union, but declined late in the trading day as newsreports played down the reports. The price of the Julysoybean contract rose 1.25 cents overall to settle at $5.94 abushel. Though weather became warm and dry throughout theMidwest, it wasn't enough to offset the unusually wet spring;so favorable planting and growing conditions yesterday hadlittle impact on grain futures prices, analysts said.However, any radiation problem likely to damage Soviet foodproduction capability and force the Soviets to buy U.S.grain, as in the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, would drivegrain futures prices up, said Steve Freed, senior grainanalyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The mysterious Sovietcloud continued to drift toward northern Finland last nightand was to be tested for radiation by Finnish authorities.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell back from Tuesday'sgains. August delivery gold was off $2.60 an ounce to$361.00. July silver declined 3.3 cents an ounce to $5.0630.July platinum eased $2.90 an ounce to $489.40. A strongerdollar triggered selling of precious metals futures, ananalyst said. Also a factor, he said, were news reports of alarge cloud over the Soviet Union, which was first thought tobe caused by a nuclear explosion. The possibility of anuclear problem caused selling of precious metals futures onthe belief that if the Soviet Union has more difficulties tocontend with it might have to sell more gold, the analystsaid, although he conceded that scenario was stretchingthings a bit. &quot;Actually, what it shows is the susceptibilityof the market to even the thought that producer selling mighttake place,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          COTTON: Most futures contracts rose to newlife-of-contract highs and retained a part of their gains.But the July 1990 contract, which represents the current1989-90 crop, hit a new high and then declined to end with anet loss of 0.24 cent a pound at 81.10 cents. Demand forcontracts early in the day was stimulated by asmaller-than-expected crop report on cotton plantings inChina, the world's top cotton producer, Thomas Mueller,analyst for Merrill Lynch, said. He noted that Chineseplantings were placed at around 13.2 million acres, about650,000 acres below industry expectations. However, Mr.Mueller said: &quot;I don't think the reported figure includescotton planted during the summer, which would add another450,000 acres to the total. I think the actual plantedacreage will be closer to 13.7 million acres.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
