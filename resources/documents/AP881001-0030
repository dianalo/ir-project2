The provision of ``modern weapons, including Stingers,long-range artillery and mortars and ground-to-ground rockets tothe extremist opposition groups and their transfer to Afghanistanis continuing,'' said Abdul Wakil, Kabul's foreign minister, onFriday.   The United States ``is still continuing the dispatch of weaponsand equipment to armed extremist groups,'' he continued, accusingPakistani militias of joining attacks in the Afghan regions of SpinBoldak, Kandahar and the Kunars.   Pakistan's ``centers of of training, arming and equiping ofarmed extremist groups on its territory have not been dismantled,''Wakil said in his speech to the 43rd General Assembly.   He contended that ``Afghanistan has never resorted to small- orlarge-scale border violations either from land or air and hasnothing to do with the internal incidents occurring in itsneighboring countries.''   Pakistan says Afghan warplanes have mounted numerous air raidson Pakistan's border villages and Afghan refugee camps to punishthe rebels, and also accuses Kabul of sponsoring terrorist bombingsin Pakistan.   Wakil said that Kabul has brought 547 cases of violations of theGeneva Accords on Afghanistan to the attention of Pakistan and theU.N. Good Office Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP).   He accused Pakistan of delaying UNGOMAP's investigation of thealleged shipment and transfer of weapons across the border ``on thepretext of the existence of tribal conflicts and lack of security.''   Soviet Foreign Ministry Gennady Gerasimov said Thursday thatUNGOMAP officials are ``not doing their job properly'' and shouldbe investigated by the secretary-general if future peacekeepingforces are to be approved.   The Afghan Accords, signed April 14 in Geneva by Pakistan andAfghanistan, with the Soviets and Americans as guarantors, call forthe Soviets to withdraw more than 100,000 Red Army troops fromAfghanistan, and for Afghanistan and Pakistan to respect eachother's territorial integrity.   On Tuesday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze saidthe Soviets had finished the first part of their troop withdrawal,but had not yet begun the second phase, and said it depended onwhether the violations of the accord cease.   U.N. observers have agreed that half the Soviet troops withdrewby Aug. 15, so Shevardnadze's statement meant the Red Army retreathas stopped for the last six weeks. The withdrawal began May 15,and is to be complete by Feb. 15, 1989.   Diego Cordovez, who mediated the Afghan Accord when he was aU.N. undersecretary, said Thursday: ``I am surprised that Mr.Gerasimov has been complaining about the monitoring mechanism(UNGOMAP), because I had a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with Mr.Shevardnadze and he said nothing to me about it.''   Cordovez recently left his U.N. post to become foreign ministerof Ecuador.</TEXT></DOC>
