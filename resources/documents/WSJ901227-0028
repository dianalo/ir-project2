FourPakistani soldiers bound out of the van with folding chairs,binoculars, maps and soft drinks.   It's time for the &quot;Indian aggression&quot; briefing. Capt.Shahid Ahmed, company commander in Pakistan's 7th NorthernLight Infantry, points across the river and says, &quot;Theirchaps opened fire from those bunkers, hitting five of ourchaps.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Capt. S. Qasim Shah, an army public relations officer,doesn't like what he hears. He didn't bounce for three hoursover a mountain road from Muzaffarabad to hear the enemyreferred to as &quot;their chaps.&quot; He interrupts: &quot;The enemy shotand badly wounded five innocent Pakistani civilians. It was abloody act of totally unprovoked Indian aggression.&quot;   Indian aggression, be it theoretical or actual, isimportant to Pakistan. It is pivotal to Pakistan's sense ofself-importance and relevance in the region, a sense that hasbeen shaken in recent months by the suspension of U.S. aidand the Soviet-U.S. agreement to cut off arms and money toneighboring Afghanistan's warring factions. For more than adecade, Pakistan served as a funnel through which the U.S.poured $300 million annually in arms and aid to Moslemguerrillas fighting the Soviet-supported Afghan government.   Without the Afghan war, Pakistan needs another role.Leaders in Islamabad see their nation as a key player in anyPersian Gulf post-crisis peacekeeping. In the meantime,Pakistan does its best to focus attention on its 43-year-oldconflict with India.   That has never been easy. Over three wars, in 1947, 1965and 1971, India and Pakistan have reminded the world thattheir mutual 1,200-mile-long border is a cut that won't heal.They were on the verge of war again last spring, this timewith each country, as local journalists like to put it,within &quot;a screwdriver turn&quot; of having nuclear weapons. Thatgot everybody's attention, but Saddam Hussein snatched itaway on Aug. 2 by invading Iraq.   Mammoth India never fades long from consciousness. ButPakistan is another story. It has a new prime minister, NawazSharif, who defeated Benazir Bhutto in an election this fall,and he has his hands full trying to govern 110 millionpeople, three out of four of whom can't read or write andmost of whom are landless laborers earning less than $400 ayear.   But these days men like Capt. Qasim have the toughest jobsin Pakistan: He and men like him have the increasinglyquixotic task of garnering the world's attention, sympathyand support for a nation that spends 52% of its nationalbudget on defense, fuels violence in adjacent India and workstirelessly to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. Congressrecently froze $573 million in military and economic aid overreports of Pakistan's continued persuit of the atomic bomb.   Capt. Qasim escorts visiting journalists to one of theworld's great flashpoints: the cease-fire line between Indiaand Pakistan in Kashmir. It is known officially as the Lineof Control. It divides Azad Kashmir, a semiautonomousPakistani state, and Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian state. TheIron Curtain has melted away with the Cold War. But thisline, older and longer than the demilitarized zone thatdivides Korea, remains, a symbol of hate and intransigence.   The message here is simple: Pakistan is still important ina world that doesn't seem to be paying attention; Pakistanijawans, enduring hardships, fend off Indian army hordes.After high-altitude artillery duels in September, thePakistan army announced success in &quot;shattering Indianarrogance.&quot;   Before 1971, Pakistan was considered important on groundsof size alone. It was the world's fifth most-populous nation.But in a war with India that year, it lost East Pakistan anddropped to ninth in the population standings, right behindBangladesh, the nation created out of territory it lost.   During the Cold War, Pakistan positioned itself as apro-Western bulwark &quot;squeezed between two militant neighbors,superpower Russia to the north and India, an aspirant to thatstatus, in the east,&quot; in the words of one writer. Today bothIndia and the Soviet Union are preoccupied with internaldisintegration.   The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 putPakistan on the map again. With U.S. and Saudi Arabianbillions, it funneled military hardware to Afghan mujahideeninsurgents. But the Soviets left almost two years ago,Afghanistan is being called the forgotten war, and thePakistan funnel is drying up.   From November 1988 to last August, Pakistan was notablefor being the first Islamic state to have a female primeminister. Benazir Bhutto was popular in the West, too --being young, female and educated at Harvard and Oxford. Shealso was unusual for heading one of only four electedgovernments in Pakistan's history-military dictators haveruled Pakistan for more than 25 of its 43 years.   Capt. Qasim has the task of telling visiting journalistswhat Pakistan isn't doing. The Pakistani military isn'tfueling the uprisings in the Indian side of Kashmir and thePunjab, he says. And it has no connection, he says, to thetwo main Kashmir liberation groups with headquarters inMuzaffarabad, where he also lives. Diplomatic sources sayPakistan has withheld support to the Jammu-Kashmir LiberationFront, which seeks independence, and supports the HezbulMujahideen, which wants all of Kashmir to be part ofPakistan.   &quot;Hezbul is our fighting force,&quot; says SheikhAqeel-ur-Rehman, a 34-year-old lawyer and president ofJamati-e-Islami in Muzaffarabad. Not only doesn't it get helpfrom the Pakistan military, it has had big trouble gettingammunition for its fighters, he says, adding: &quot;We appeal toall freedom-loving peoples and peace-loving countries inhelping us with ammunition.&quot;   Sheikh Aqeel says Hezbul's goal is to turn Kashmir intothe next Afghanistan and he says his group looks forward towelcoming the Afghan mujahideen to fight alongside them. &quot;Itis possible we may capture some parts of Kashmir by force,&quot;he says. The Afghan mujahideen want to send guns, ammo andfighters &quot;but the Pakistan government doesn't allow.&quot;   Also in Muzaffarabad is Amanullah Khan, 57-year-oldchairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. His house isguarded by young men with machine guns and full of youngKashmiris and their sleeping bags. &quot;Refugees,&quot; he says with awink. &quot;All right, we do it,&quot; he says when asked about bordercrossings. Weapons smuggling? &quot;We do it.&quot;   Sometimes, even Pakistan's friends are bad for its image.The secretary-general of the India-Pakistan FriendshipSociety is Satish Kumar, a college professor in New Delhi,India's capital. The organization promotes friendship betweenthe two countries, but that doesn't mean it has to play downPakistan's faults.   &quot;Over the years of prolonged military rule, an entrenchedgroup of officers has developed deep interests in theeconomy,&quot; says Prof. Kumar. &quot;Granting licenses for drugtrafficking is most lucrative for them. This business is verydirectly protected by the military establishment.&quot;   Pakistan aid for Kashmir is &quot;low-cost troublemaking,&quot; hesays. &quot;They don't want to end it. It doesn't cost much.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
