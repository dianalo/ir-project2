PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ron Webeck could barely walk,couldn't talk and was nearly blind when he was flown to hisfamily's home to die of a devastating AIDS-related brain disease.That was more than four years ago.   Today, Webeck, 42, is thriving and researchers are trying tofind out why.   ``I realize that I'm probably not supposed to be here,'' hesaid. ``I've been given an incredible gift _ I'm cured.''   Tests have failed to turn up the AIDS virus in Webeck's blood.Even rarer is that scientists can no longer find a trace of thevirus that caused his brain infection _ progressive multifocalleukoencephalopathy, or PML _ a disease that preys on AIDS victimsand usually kills within six months.   ``Sure he's healthy _ he looks good, he feels good and he can doanything he wants to do,'' said Dr. Joseph Berger, a University ofMiami neurologist and AIDS researcher who wrote about the case inthe medical journal Neurology.   ``But I'd have to say with 99 percent certainty that he'ssitting on a time bomb,'' Berger said, ``That what caused hisillness in the first place is somehow being suppressed and willcome back.''   AIDS researcher Sidney Houff, who examined Webeck at theNational Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., calls his recovery``remarkable,'' but he's not ready to call it permanent. ``Whatexactly caused him to survive and recover is a mystery. We hadnever seen anyone survive from it before. Up until that point,everyone with PML had died a miserable death.   ``There's no telling what may happen in the future. I'm hopefulfor him, but if his immune system is sufficiently challenged,there's always the chance the virus that causes PML will reappear.''   Webeck thinks doctors are being overly cautious.   ``I'm going on five years now. How long do I have to be healthybefore they finally give up and agree I'm well?''   For Webeck, who says he lived in the fast lane of SanFrancisco's gay community in his 20s, the first signs something waswrong came in the spring of 1985. While working as a waiter inProvincetown, Mass., he felt an aggravating twinge in his neck. Hesoon began falling down and had to quit because he could no longeradd customers' bills.   A culture of spinal fluid taken at Massachusetts GeneralHospital eight weeks later showed the presence of the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A scanrevealed lesions on his brain and a biopsy showed that PML hadinfected his brain tissue.   After weeks of violent illness and with his weight at just above120, doctors suggested Webeck make plans to be with his family.They thought he only had days to live. ``They didn't have to saythe word _ it was written all over their faces. They rushed me homewith no medicine, nothing.   ``They figured, `What's the use?'''   Dr. Leonard Mueke, who treated Webeck at Massachusetts General,said he had to tell the patient and his family the dismal prognosis.   ``Based on what we knew about other patients similarlydiagnosed, I don't think we had any option but to conclude that hedidn't have a very good outlook,'' said Mueke, now at the ScrippsClinic in La Jolla, Calif.   ``He was sent home with two medications to treat certainsymptoms of his illness that he opted not to take, but it's true wehad nothing to give him for his primary diagnosis of AIDS and PML.''   Under his parents' care in St. Petersburg, Webeck sufferedthrough seizures and a bout with depression that ended in hisattempt to take an overdose of sedatives. After 10 days in thehospital, he survived.   ``That was a big turning point for me. I met death and wasspared. I started to realize I got some work to do before I go.''   That's when, amazingly, Webeck started getting better.   Without medical treatment, only an attitude shaped by books onpositive thinking and an insatiable will to live, Webeck beganforcing himself to eat and teaching himself to walk again. By July1986, he set out to find a cause for his return to health. He wroteto every major medical center and AIDS researcher in the country.   After scores of encouraging but noncommittal responses, Bergerat Miami and then Houff at NIH agreed to make extensiveexaminations. Some procedures were painful, such as tapping bonemarrow and spinal fluid, but Webeck hoped for clues that could helpothers.   Huff, who completed more than three weeks of examinations ofWebeck in June, found that all components of his immune system werebasically normal. One odd thing was that Webeck had the usualnumber of B lymphocytes, white blood cells that produce antibodiesagainst disease. All other PML patients Houff had seen had producedvast numbers of tainted blood cells that made their way into thebrain tissue and caused the infection.   ``His immune system was able to shut down the production of Blymphocytes and slow the progress of the disease,'' Houff said.``Now, how he was able to do that is something we don't know.''   Houff, who has moved to the Veteran's Administration Hospital inWashington, D.C., and the faculty of Georgetown University,currently has five other patients involved in his study. Four havelived after bouts with PML, but for much shorter periods thanWebeck, and all but one are suffering other AIDS-related infections.   Meantime, the tanned, mustachioed Webeck is stronger than ever,recently put in the peculiar circumstance of being a one-time AIDSpatient forced to go on a diet when his weight topped 180 pounds.   Webeck receives a disability check from Social Security, so hehas time to speak to churches and civic groups, and to care for afriend with AIDS. He hopes to travel full-time to promote AIDSresearch and to show that the virus does not always mean a deathsentence.   ``I can't even count the number of people I've seen die fromAIDS,'' he said. ``Many of them were so devastated when they heardthey had it they sort of gave up. If people see me, maybe they willthink twice that miracles do happen.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
