Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 15 defendants, twoof whom remain at large, for allegedly trying to kill two formergovernment ministers and a magazine editor.   They are seeking penalties for the others of up to life inprison.   The defendants pleaded innocent and said they were tortured andabused by state security policemen and prosecutors duringquestioning. The prosecution denied the allegations.   The 15 facing possible death sentences are charged with formingan illegal organization called ``Salvation from Hell'' with theintent of destabilizing the government through assassinations andother attacks.   They are charged with the attempted murders last year of formerinterior ministers Hassan Abu Basha on May 6 and el-Nabawi Ismailon Aug. 13, and magazine editor Makram Mohammed Ahmed on June 4.   Abu Basha was wounded seriously, Ahmed sustained a minor handwound and Ismail was not injured.   All of the defendants are accused of illegally possessingfirearms, explosives and pamphlets that contained informationdesigned to incite anti-government violence.   Security was strong outside the courtroom, with at least fourarmored personnel carriers and scores of armed soldiers present.The 4{-hour session before chief Judge Omar el-Oteify of theSupreme State Security Court and two fellow judges dealt mainlywith procedural matters.   The 31 defendants in custody sat or stood in three cages in thecourtroom, a renovated exhibition hall.   White banners hanging on the cages' iron bars proclaimed ``TheMoslems Are Coming'' and ``Prison and Execution Won't Move Us Awayfrom Islam.'' The defendants chanted similar slogans.   Attorney Abdel-Halim Mandour, speaking for the group of 47defense lawyers, told the court that police fabricated evidenceagainst the defendants.   ``There is no illegal organization. This is a fabrication fromthe state security,'' Mandour said. ``It is an attempt by thesepeople to strike against Islam and religious men.''</TEXT></DOC>
