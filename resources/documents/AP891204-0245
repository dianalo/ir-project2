(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   To Konrad Trojniar the pension dispute withhis ex-employer turns on principles of justice and loyalty, but theopposing lawyers in the case of Continental Can Inc. are tradingcharges of racketeering, terrorizing and coercion.   Trojniar, now 49, is among some 2,500 former Continentalemployees who are suing the company in a class action arguing thatthey were laid off to prevent them from becoming eligible tocollect pensions.   ``In other words, they weren't loyal to us,'' said Trojniar, ofHinsdale, Ill. ``I would like to get what I got coming.''   Last May, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin sided with them.   But the workers haven't seen a dime as the company appeals theruling and a fight has broken out over how much should be paid towhom.   In the meantime, Trojniar, who was laid off in 1978 just twoyears short of pension eligibility, is earning $5.50 an hour as amaintenance man at a Chicago chemical company. That's half of whathe made feeding an aerosol can press for Continental.   ``I gave them the good years, so to speak,'' he said.   In its appeal Continental says Sarokin improperly extended hisruling from one plant to 46, allowed workers to join the classindiscriminately and ignored previous case law.   The ex-workers' attorneys say the cost to Continental could runto $1 billion. The other side expects a settlement in the $50million range, said a source familiar with court proceedings whospoke on the condition of anonymity. Attorneys said there waslittle progress on a settlement.   The dispute, involving dozens of attorneys at prominent firmsnationwide, took a rancorous turn in October. The workers filedpapers accusing Continental's owner, Peter Kiewit andamp; Sons Inc., ofsiphoning off more than $1 billion from Continental to avoid havingto pay a potentially huge judgment.   Last month, Kiewit agreed to submit certain asset transfers ordividend payments to the judge's review. The company denies seekingto transfer funds to avoid paying a judgment.   The workers' amended lawsuit also adds individual executives andKiewit parent companies as defendants on a claim of racketeering.An attorney for the workers, Robert Plotkin of Chicago, said thataction was intended to hold the Kiewit companies accountable fortheir subsidiaries' responsibilities.   But Continental attorney Edwin C. Thomas said that accusing theKiewit companies and individuals of racketeering is a ``coercive,terrorizing event'' designed to inflate the amount of money theworkers would receive in a settlement. Under the racketeering law,the defendants could be found liable for triple damages if theylose.   Thomas also accused the lawyers of making the funds transferallegation as a way to attack the company under cover of courtpapers, ``without facing any slander or defamation charges.''   The workers' court papers said that from the end of 1984, theyear of its purchase, Continental's net worth dropped from $1.5billion to $311 million by last March.   Assets were sold to pay off loans for Kiewit's leveraged buyoutof Continental, the court papers said. In addition, the workerscontended, huge dividends were paid to Continental's parent _amounting to $634 million in 1986 alone, when net earnings were $93million.   But Kiewit Continental Inc. general counsel Stephen Bermas saidassets were sold to pay off debt as in any other leveraged buyout,and many of them were non-can related, such as insurance, oil andgas and timberland interests.   ``Whatever transfer of funds from Continental Can that occurredwere fully explainable by other good, legitimate business reasonsthat had no relation whatsoever to this lawsuit,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
