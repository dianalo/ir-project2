Instead of the official exchange rate of 570 zlotys to thedollar, the state-owned PKO bank was offering dollars at a ``freemarket'' rate of 3,000 zlotys.   None of the customers seemed to mind. They were happy to have thegreenbacks at any price.   Until now, they were banned by law from buying dollars with theirzlotys, and had to avail themselves of the ubiquitous black market.   The bank also was selling zlotys at a rate of 2,900 for $1 _ aboon for those Poles who earn hard currency abroad or who providegoods or services for hard currency. That window was less frenzied,however.   No personal identification was required at the bank and noquestions were asked about where their money came from.   Demand for dollars is strong in Poland because the best materialgoods, ranging from houses and cars to imported electronicsequipment and infant formula, usually are available only for dollarsor other hard currency.   Poles who travel to the West also need hard currency to spend,since the zloty cannot be traded abroad.   The state-run news agency said the new foreign currency law isintended to end ``the legal fiction'' of the official exchange ratefor private transactions.   The law is part of the government's broader effort at economicreform, which has a goal of strengthening Poland's notoriously weakcurrency, devalued regularly on Mondays. Officials hope the zlotywill eventually find its correct level.   Before Wednesday, legally obtained dollars could be converted byPoles to zlotys only at the unrealistic official rate _ far too lowto be attractive. There was no legal way to buy dollars with zlotys.   For now, foreigners still are banned from engaging in the freecurrency market and are obliged to use the more disadvantageousofficial rate of 570 zlotys for $1.   Economic authorities say making the zloty fully convertibleimmediately would be too much of a shock to the economy, so for nowthey are trying only ``internal convertibility'' among Poles.   PKO bank officials said four of its branches in Warsaw weretrading in currencies, as well as banks in other cities.   Krzysztof Najgrodzki, manager of the capital's main PKO branch,said he regretted he couldn't spare more tellers, ``but we are asavings bank and we have to attend to our regular customers.''   Najgrodzki said the exchange rate would be watched closely andcould be adjusted even during the course of a day to ``balancedelivery to demand.''   It was too early to say how big the business would prove for thebank, he said. The PKO generally plans to sell as many dollars as itreceives, but, ``You can't sell what you don't have.''   Najgrodzki and his assistant, Robert Marianski, said the new lawallows Poles to do legally something that many have been doingillegally for years.   Marianski said the bank is under no illusion that black-markettrading will stop. ``The black market was, is and will be,'' he said.   The dozens of people pressed around the exchange windowrepeatedly were beckoned by many black-market operators millingaround in the bank. Some people even left the line to take advantageof the black-marketeers' faster service.   Rajmond, a 36-year-old operator who appeared to be the chiefblack marketeer present, sauntered up to a Western reporter and saidthe black-market traders were offering the same rate as the bank,but without having to stand in line.   For the traders, he said, the only difference now is that thebank can set the ceiling on the exchange rate. They won't chargemore for dollars than the bank, but they will charge less when theymust in order to generate business.   ``It's a capitalist life for us. I am a businessman,'' he saidphilosophically as his helpers worked the crowd. ``For us, it'sAmerica.''</TEXT></DOC>
