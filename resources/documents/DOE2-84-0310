The initial bench-scaletests with surrogate sludges have shown that wet or dry surrogates canbe processed into solid monoliths that meet the Waste Isolation PilotPlant (WIPP) waste acceptance criteria (WAC). Sodium Nitrate (NaNO{sub3}) binds the other solids when the wt% of NaNO{sub 3} is greater thanor equal to the wt% of the other solids. Microwave penetration depthexperiments have shown that a wet slurrey absorbs microwave energy withina few cm of the slurry surface while dried surrogates below 100{degree}Care heated throughout the depth (20 cm) of the surrogate volume. Thelatest bench scale processing of wet surrogates has demonstrated goodprocess control, provided that certain diagnostics which monitor, temperature,boiling absorbed microwave power, and arcing are implemented.</TEXT></DOC>
