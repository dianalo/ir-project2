But some board members said the action might be insufficient to solve future clearing snarls after heavy trading sessions.    After a 2 1/2-hour special meeting late yesterday, the exchange's board of governors authorized a process that will require clearing member firms -- and not brokers as at present -- to relay trades directly to the exchange by computer to be matched and cleared. Clearing firms process trades for exchange customers.    The board also required all traders to be guaranteed by a clearing member, and to provide complete customer-account information to the clearing member with each trade.    Currently, a Comex floor broker writes up trades made with other brokers and passes the information along to a clerk. The clerk brings the cards every half hour to a &quot;write up&quot; room. There, other clerks punch the trades into the exchange's computer system. The data finally are passed along to a clearing firm that matches up the trades.    The new system effectively eliminates the middle step, transferring the responsibility of entering the trades into an exchange computer from about 450 floor brokers to the approximately 70 clearing firms. Floor traders will submit trade information to clearing members for electronic submission to the exchange's computer system, where matching and clearing occur.    But some Comex board members criticized the move, saying the exchange failed to act on a more significant point.    Specifically, some members said, the board failed to approve a proposal that would require all trading booths located on the floor to be staffed and operated by clearing member firms. Currently, all floor members, including independent traders, can have booths.    Comex clearing members now will have to guarantee that all traders make good on their trades, as is the practice at the nation's two largest futures exchanges in Chicago. Some clearing firms complain that because they will be responsible for trades, they should also have control of all the booths where orders are taken.    &quot;I'm not sure clearing members will be willing to accept some trades without verifying the firm that made the trade,&quot; said Jack Lehman, senior executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York and a Comex board member.    &quot;The process of verifying that may cause delays and an unwillingness to clear those trades, resulting in a large number of uncleared trades,&quot; said Mr. Lehman. &quot;Therefore, they're not solving the clearing problem.&quot;    Comex officials declined to comment on the criticism, saying only that the proposal in question is being studied.    An exchange computer system that can handle the new trading system has been in place since November, Comex officials noted. The new system likely will be phased in during the next few months, industry analysts said.    A backlog of unresolved trades forced the Comex two weeks ago to halt trading early for three consecutive days. The clearing crunch, which has been largely resolved, stemmed from higher volume and volatility in precious metals trading, especially silver. </TEXT></DOC>
