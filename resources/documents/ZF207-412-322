 Justice Department attorney Mark Rasch sumsup the ongoing efforts to strengthen computer crime legislation with an oldHill aphorism: &quot;Those who like sausage, and have respect for the law, shouldnever watch either being made.&quot;andM;In question are two House bills reintroduced to the 101st Congress to amendtitle 18 of the U.S.andP;  Criminal Code.andP;  Proponents of H.R.andP;  55, VirusEradication Act and H.R.andP;  287, Computer Protection Act are confident thebills successfully tighten any remaining loopholes in the original statuteand offer much more potent legal protection against computer crime.andP;  Critics,however, claim the acts are so laden with ambiguity that translations mayrender many common practices illegal (see boxes).andM;In essence, H.R.andP;  55 is designed to provide penalties for persons interferingwith the operations of computers with programs containing hidden commandsthat can cause harm.andP;  Whereas, H.R.andP;  287 would create civil and criminalpenalties for persons (or organizations) which knowingly and maliciouslyalter computer hardware or software so as to disable a computer eitherthrough the loss of stored data or interference with its proper functioning.andM;As the coordinator for all Justice Department computer fraud cases prosecutedunder section 1030 of the U.S.andP;  Criminal Code, Rasch is often asked to reviewand comment on new legislation in the field.andP;  He sees several problems inH.R.andP;  55, primarily its attempt to address certain parts of the problem, butnot the entire problem.andP;  The real test, he points out, is the phrase &quot;knowingor having reason to believe (a program) may cause damage&quot; because theinterpretation can include every piece of software in America.andM;&quot;Frequently, statutes are written that criminalize things that should not becriminal,&quot; Rasch explains.andP;  &quot;You want to write them broad enough so that theydeal with the problem you want to deal with, and narrowly enough so that theydon't criminalize a whole class of activity that might otherwise beprotected.&quot;andM;The Virus Eradication Act was originally introduced last July--months beforethe Internet worm or West German spy ring incidents--to aless-than-enthusiastic Congress, recalls Douglas Riggs, legislative assistantto H.R.andP;  55 author Wally Herger (R-CA).andP;  Since then the bill, andCongressional membership, have been somewhat reorganized and recent computercrime stories have heightened political interest.andM;&quot;There is a lot the bill cannot address initially in terms of its language,&quot;Riggs explains.andP;  &quot;We are just offering a base on which we could expand whenwe go into hearings.andP;  We think we've come up with something that is the bestpossible solution at this point as we see it.&quot;andM;There are no sanctions for unauthorized access in H.R.andP;  55, and the omissionwas intentional.andP;  If a person, authorized or not, creates a virus thatintentionally endangers a single file--which could mean anything from loss oftime to loss of business because of customers losing trust in a company--thatperson has committed a crime and will be held accountable.andM;The purpose of the proposed bill is to introduce specific legislation againstviruses into section 1030, the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.andP;  Thebroadness of the bill, Riggs explains, is due to the fact that the term virusis still difficult to define and probably destined for obsolescence.andM;Fortifying the Criminal Code against acts of malicious computer sabotage isalso the impetus behind H.R.andP;  287, authored and introduced in the House byTom McMillen (D-MD) subsequent to H.R.andP;  55.andP;  Although sabotage can beprosecuted under the current law, it is not presented explicitly in the codeand therefore is difficult to try.andM;The goal of H.R.andP;  287 is to impose stronger criminal and civil fines onpersons who maliciously invade a computer system.andP;  &quot;This is not about aperson who accidently stumbles into a system and messes things up,&quot; says aspokesperson for Rep.andP;  McMillen.andP;  &quot;The bill is specifically worded toindicate that malice and motivation must be proven.&quot;andM;As beneficial as legislation against computer crime might appear, Jay J.andO;BloomBecker warns that talk is cheap.andP;  As chair of ACM's Legal Issues inComputing board and director of the National Center for Computer Crime Data,Los Angeles, BloomBecker warns that it's one thing to have more opportunityto go after those that have clearly broken laws, it's another thing to makethose laws effective.andM;&quot;In general, most of the discussion of computer crime law has beenself-indulgent, self-aggrandizement by lawyers who assume what the laws saywill have some effect,&quot; he asserts.andP;  &quot;The biggest fallacy is that the lawsdon't say anything until you put some money behind them to enforce them.andP;  Forthe most part, that hasn't happened yet on a state or federal level.&quot;andM;Senate Gets Into ActandM;While Herger and McMillen await hearing dates for their bills on the Housedocket, the Senate has initiated some basic groundwork into its owninvestigation of computer security problems.andP;  On May 15, the Sub-committee onTechnology and the Law of the Senate Judiciary Committee held its firsthearing on the issue of computer viruses.andP;  The hearing, set to examine thescope of the threat posed by computer invasions, was chaired by Sen.andP;  PatrickLeahy (D-VT), and featured panelists William S. Sessions, director of theFBI, and Wily Hacker sleuth Cliff Stoll, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centerfor Astrophysics.andP;  (See Communications, May 1988, p. 484.)andM;Sessions maintains that while existing federal statutes could use sometightening up and stronger enforcement, they are basically adequate from theFBI's perspective.andP;  He pointed out how the Computer Fraud and Abuse Actsigned in 1984 was strengthened by 1986 amendments that expanded itscrime-oriented base to include federal interest computers.andP;  (Those computersused exclusively by financial institutions or the U.S.andP;  government, orcomputers that are one of two or more located in different states and used incommitting and underlying offense.)andM;The Bureau chief also noted that the educational benefits derived from thefree flow of information must be balanced with the need to prevent criminalactivity having the potential for millions of dollars in damage.andP;  WarnsSessions: &quot;Once the balance tips to criminal activity, the FBI intends topursue vigorously those who violate federal law through the creation andintroduction of viruses.&quot;andM;Stoll detailed the integral role computer networks play in the academic andscientific environs, portraying them as intricate and as necessary as thestreets, roads and highways that tie global communities together.andM;He touched on his own two-year experience tracking the West German hacker whowas apprehended last spring, and ended by urging both government and industryto recognize their responsibility in protecting this vital resource ofinformation.andP;  &quot;Now, our electronic communities are threatened,&quot; Stollstresses.andP;  &quot;Vandals have spread computer viruses and worms.andP;  Foreigninstitutions have been robbed electronically.andP;  Alas, our golden age of trustis ending.&quot;andM;Strength in NumbersandM;The ACM and other professional organizations can play a definitive role inthe direction and effectiveness of computer crime legislation.andM;In his June 1989 President's Letter (Communications, p. 660) Bryan Kochercalls for computing professionals to take control of their industry beforeoutsiders do.andP;  Although federal legislation assures consistent, higherquality regulations, Kocher fears a mishmash of nightmarish state laws.andP;  Heis proposing that ACM and IEEE and other industry associations adopt andenforce standards for computing professionals.andM;BloomBecker agrees and has already made plans to suggest at his next boardmeeting that ACM and the IEEE jointly create a standard or bylaw thatindicates how the organizations will respond and react to members involved incomputer-related crime.andM;Rasch and Riggs urge computer associations to voice their comments on theissue of computer crime to local state representatives, and to the offices ofCongressman Wally Herger (1108 Longworth, Washington, D.C.andP;  20515.andP;  Phone:202-225-3076), or Tom McMillen, (327 CHOB, Washington, D.C.andP;  20575.andP;  Phone:202-225-8090).andP;  The Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law (The HartOffice Building, Suite 815, Washington, D.C., 20510.andP;  Phone: 202-224-3406)has also issued an invitation to ACM to discuss computer crime concerns.andM;Riggs points out that Herger's office has already met with members of severalindustry trade organizations regarding H.R.andP;  55, insisting it is the only wayto create comprehensive laws against high-tech crime.andP;  &quot;We've been trying towork as much as we can with people in the real world,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;D.C.andP;  isnot the real world, and all too often we have a tendency here to think wehave the best solution to any problem.&quot;andM;Sen.andP;  Leahy, addressing the Senate hearing, presses the issue with theultimate scenario: &quot;As a nation, we cannot afford data that scientists cannottrust.andP;  We cannot afford to have scientists refusing to use computer networksto share their discoveries, and thus, advance technology.&quot;andM;Excerpts from H.R.andP;  55: Virus Eradication ActandM;(Whoever) knowingly:andM;(A) inserts into a program for a computer, or a computer itself, informationor commands, knowing or having reason to believe that such information orcommands may cause loss, expense or risk to health or  welfare...to users whorely on information processed on such computer;
