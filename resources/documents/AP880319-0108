Sandinista Defense Committees, the party's neighborhoodwatchdogs, have organized meetings and marches against the presenceof the 3,200 U.S. soldiers in Honduras, sent in response to areported incursion into Honduran territory by Sandinista troopspursuing Contra rebels.   Before the Reagan administration announced the deployment of thetroops, the Sandinistas were undergoing their worst economic,social and political crisis since coming to power in a 1979revolutionary war.   Complaints that had been whispered for years turned into openconfrontations with the government.   Economic measures announced Feb. 14, which included priceincreases, sparked demonstrations. Workers staged wildcat strikesto demand higher salaries. Family members openly protested againstthe military draft.   Such displays were illegal under a state of emergency enacted inMarch 1982. The government revoked the law in January as part ofNicaragua's compliance with a Central American peace plan callingfor democracy in the region.   But with the announcement that American troops were going toHonduras, the opposition's gripes were overshadowed by warnings ofa possible invasion.   ``We are calling on the Nicaraguan public to be alert, to be incombat readiness, ready to repel, resist, defeat whateveraggression from the United States,'' President Daniel Ortega toldthe nation.   On Wednesday, the government ordered all radio stations to hookinto a government-controlled national network, which has beenbroadcasting ``alerts'' to the public to prepare for directmilitary invasion.   ``We are ready to repel and annihilate any attempt by theAmerican infantry. A free fatherland or death,'' network announcersdeclared all of last week.   The Nicaraguan government has denied its army crossed intoHonduras, claiming instead that it began an offensive on March 8 toroust the Contras from bases along the rugged, jungle border area.   Ortega claimed the Reagan administration alleged the Nicaraguanincursion to obtain congressional approval for more Contra aid.Congress twice rejected renewed Contra assistance earlier this year.   Two years ago this month _ a week after the Congress voted downa $100 million aid package for the rebels _ the Reaganadministration said Sandinista troops had entered Honduras. U.S.pilots ferried Honduran soldiers to the border. Congress approvedthe aid package three months later, on June 25, 1986.   Congress once again began discussing renewed Contra aid onFriday.   American troops in Honduras have also brought the Sandinistasinternational attention.   Protests of the U.S. deployment erupted in the United States.   On Saturday, a U.N. spokesman said a team of U.N. observerswould visit Nicaragua to investigate the Honduran-Nicaraguan bordersituation, at Nicaragua's request.   Honduran war planes buzzed and then dropped bombs Thursday alongthe banks of the Coco River that forms the border, and theSandinista government blamed the United States for the attack,filing diplomatic notes of protest to Washington.   The Nicaraguan government said it will appeal to theInternational Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to issuean injunction against ``any military activity that could raisetension in Central America.''   Appearing on a television talk show Saturday morning, Ortegasaid Peru has condemned the presence of troops in Honduras. Peru isa member of the eight-nation Contadora group that has been tryingto negotiate an end to Central American conflicts for the pastseven years without success.   The Sandinistas have said they are ready to start cease-firetalks with Contra leaders on Monday in an effort to end the6-year-old war. The Contras had threatened to boycott the talksbecause of the border conflict, but said Saturday that they wouldparticipate.   The Honduran government has not offered proof that theNicaraguan troops are or were in its territory, and Ortega contendsthat Honduras was following the whims of Washington when it calledfor the U.S. troops.</TEXT></DOC>
