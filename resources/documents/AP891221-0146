After the 50-minute meeting, the civilian president-elect toldreporters he asked Pinochet to consider relinquishing the command,which he cannot be forced to do under the constitution his militaryregime wrote in 1980.   ``I thought it my duty to let him know I considered itpreferable that he not make use'' of the special constitutionalprovisions, Aylwin said. ``He told me the opposite.''   ``The issue was left pending for another conversation,'' Aylwinsaid. When asked whether he thought Pinochet would change his mind,the president-elect said: ``You'll have to ask him.''   Aylwin, a 71-year-old moderate Christian Democrat supported by a17-party coalition, won a landslide victory in elections Dec. 14and will take office March 11th with a new civiilian Congress.   He said several other issues were discussed in Thursday'smeeting at the presidential palace, including a bill prepared bythe ruling junta that would give the military virtual autonomyunder civilian rule.   Pinochet, 74, made no immediate comment, but Interior MinisterCarlos Caceres, who was present at the meeting, gave an accountsimilar to Aylwin's.   The general seized power in September 1973, overthrowingPresident Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist who died in thecoup. He was forced to call elections when voters rejected areferendum proposal last year that his presidency be extended to1997.   According to Aylwin, Pinochet said his remaining as commanderwas ``the best guarantee of the army's loyalty to the constitutionand the future government.''   Thursday's meeting was the first known direct conversation sincethe coup between Pinochet and any leading critic of hisauthoritarian rule.   About 2,000 Aylwin supporters waited outside the palace for hisarrival and chanted, ``Give it to him hard!'' as thepresident-elect entered the building.   When some government officials peered through trough gtrgout ofwindowsped out palace windows, the crowd waved and shouted, ``Goaway, Pinochet!'' and ``The dictatorship will fall!''   Aylwin said he and Pinochet they discussed a proposed ArmedForces Law that would bar the new government from cutting thedefense budget, limit its influence in promotion of officers andallow the military to decide on arms purchases without governmentapproval.   The four-man military junta that acts as a legislature underPinochet has yet to approve the legislation.   Pinochet invited him to prepare written comments on the ArmedForces Law and other issues, ``then our people and people from thegovernment would debate their differences and look for reasonablesolutions,'' Aylwin said.</TEXT></DOC>
