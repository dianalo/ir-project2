The recent publication of ``A Woman Named Jackie'' and her 60thbirthday on July 28 prompted Stafford, founder of Sidewalks of NewYork, to come up with the tour. Also included are churches whereshe has worshiped; her bank and favorite shops; the Carlyle Hotel,where President Kennedy allegedly had trysts with Marilyn Monroe;the Pierre Hotel, where Aristotle Onassis kept a suite; and thehomes of her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and otherrelatives.   Stafford did exhaustive research.   ``There are about 22 different books written on Jackie throughthe years and I have all of them,'' he said. ``I've seen herseveral times. About four years ago, we were walking up FifthAvenue when my friend screamed, `There she is!' I tripped and fellat her feet. One of her bodyguards picked me up by the collar.''</TEXT><DATELINE>JUPITER, Fla.

The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback asked in a letter datedAug. 1 that a meeting be set up between representatives of theEastern pilots union and Roger Porter, Bush's domestic policyadviser.   Staubach said the striking pilots include the best man at hiswedding, football teammates and classmates at the U.S. NavalAcademy, where Staubach also was a quarterback.   From his conversations with those friends and from ``all otheraccounts,'' Staubach wrote, ``it is obvious that the Easternsituation is far more than a traditional labor-management dispute.It goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within ourcountry.''   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no commenton Staubach's letter or speculation that the former footballplayer, who now runs a real estate company in Dallas, might getinvolved in making a buyout offer for the company.</TEXT></DOC>
