Section 6831 <T3>et seq</T3>. The Federal agencies are required to design new Federalcommercial and multi-family high rise residential buildings in accordancewith the energy efficiency requirements prescribed by the interim voluntaryenergy performance standards. The standards do not regulate non-Federalconstruction, however DOE recommends the use of the interim standards tothe design professions and owners and operators of commercial and multi-familyhigh rise residential buildings as guidelines for the design of energyconserving buildings.Prior to the promulgation of the interim standards, DOE published, on May6, 1987, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) (52 FR 17051 <T3>et seq.</T3>) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The NOPR announced DOE's intention to promulgateinterim voluntary standards for new Federal commercial and multi-familyhigh rise residential buildings and provided for a ninety day public commentperiod and three public hearings. The comment period closed on August 4,1987.In response to public comment and with the availability of additional technicalinformation, DOE made revisions to the proposed interim standards.The interim standards represent a significant Federal effort to assistthe private sector in developing energy conservation standards withoutregulatory intrusion. Congress has directed Federal agencies to regulatetheir own design practice instead of someone else's by setting an examplethat may be transferred to the private sector by adoption of similar standards.For this reason, the interim standards issued today are presented in theformat of commercial standards instead of a Federal regulation. A moreconventional regulatory format could easily serve to regulate Federal designpractices but it would not be as easy to transfer to private sector designpractices. To facilitate such transferability, DOE has used the commercialstandards format for the interim standards that can be better understoodand more readily used in the private sector. Also, for the same reasonthe interim standards contain extensive explanatory material not normallyincluded in Federal standards.<ITAG tagnum="74">I. Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">II.

Background</ITAG>Originally enacted on August 14, 1976 as Title III of the Energy Conservationand Production Act, Pub. L. 94-385, 90 Stat. 1144 <T3>et seq</T3>., 42 U.S.C. 6831, the Act required the Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD) to develop, promulgate, implement and enforcecompliance with performance standards to improve the energy efficiencyof all new buildings in the nation. On August 4, 1977, the Act was amendedby Section 304(a), 42 U.S.C. 7154, of the Department of Energy OrganizationAct, Pub. L. 95-91, 91 Stat. 565 <T3>et seq</T3>., which transferred from HUD to DOE the responsibilityto develop and promulgate the standards. The amendments to the Act didnot change HUD's implementation responsibilities. In November 1979, DOE published proposed performance standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 44 FR 68120 (November 28, 1979). The noticewas controversial and generated over 1,800 comments totalling 40,000 pages.The comments included technical and other substantive criticisms of theperformance standards. Less than a year after the publication of the proposed standards, the Actwas again amended. Section 326, 94 Stat. 1649, of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-399 (October 8, 1980) required thatDOE promulgate interim standards by August 1, 1981 and extended the promulgationdate of the final standards to April 1, 1983. The interim standards wereonly to apply to new Federal buildings. In addition, the Act required demonstrationprojects to be conducted in at least two geographical areas.In August 1981, Congress again amended the Act. Subtitle D of Title 10of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 621,amended the Act to create the term ``voluntary performance standards'',eliminated the provision for a possible statutory sanction for noncompliance,added a provision that, except for Federal buildings, ``voluntary standardswill be developed solely as guidelines to provide technical assistancefor the design and construction of energy efficient buildings'', and extendedthe deadline for DOE to furnish reports on the demonstration projects toCongress. The legislative changes that have taken place since the original 1976 enactmentrequired DOE to make fundamental changes to the compliance aspects of thestandard regulatory approach which Congress had earlier directed the Departmentto take. DOE retains the responsibility for developing performance standardsto achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency anduse of non-depletable resources for all new buildings. However, these standardsnow serve a dual purpose. The performance standards serve one purpose forthe Federal sector where the standards prescribe mandatory design requirements.For non-Federal buildings, voluntary performance standards serve only asguidelines for the purpose of providing technical assistance for the designand construction of energy efficient buildings. Accordingly, the performancestandards serve a second purpose of providing sound technical informationand examples of efficient design practices for voluntary use in the privatesector.On August 20, 1986, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 29754) proposed interim mandatory energyconservation performance standards for new Federal residential buildings.These proposed Federal residential standards were the first of three proposedinterim standards; the second being the interim standards for commercialand high rise residential buildings being promulgated today. The Departmentalso intends to publish voluntary interim standards for new non-Federalsector residential housing sometime in the future. DOE has completed aresearch project with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating andAir-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) that has culminated in recommendationsbeing made to both DOE and ASHRAE on new residential building standards.Following promulgation of these interim standards, DOE will undertake ademonstration project that will at minimum include an analysis of the impactof the standards on the design, construction costs, and the energy savings,including the types of energy to be realized from utilizing these energystandards. In addition, DOE will analyze the impact on residential builders,especially small builders and the impact of construction costs on the abilityof low-and-moderate-income persons to purchase or rent units in such buildings.The Act requires that the demonstration program has a duration of at leastone year and that within 180 days of its completion, a report of the resultsfrom the demonstration program be sent to the Congress. The Act also requiresthat the standards be reviewed on a non-specific periodic basis and revisedaccording to more recent information and research.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Interim Standards</ITAG>A. Summary of the Interim StandardsThe interim rule establishes interim energy conservation voluntary performancestandards for the design of new commercial and multi-family high rise residentialbuildings. The interim standards reflect DOE's attempt to simplify compliance,incorporate an improved understanding of building component interactionsthat affect energy use, ensure architectural and engineering design flexibility,and encourage consideration of energy conserving design measures in theearliest stages of the design of commercial and multi-family high riseresidential buildings.The format is similar, but not identical, to that proposed in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESStandard 90.1P recommended for the design of new commercial buildings bythe American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,Inc. and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES). Boththe DOE interim standards and the proposed ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1Pwere developed based on a joint DOE/ASHRAE research project that culminatedwith the publication of the research findings in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 26, 1984, (49 FR 3245 <T3>et seq</T3>.). Since the completion of the research project, the DOEand ASHRAE/IES standards have followed a parallel track. ASHRAE/IES haveprovided, through their committee structure, much of the technical expertisethat has been necessary in the development of the standards. DOE has providedcomplementary expertise and research results and has also been responsiblefor the majority of the technical analysis.The format used is intended by DOE to facilitate the voluntary use of theinterim standards by designers. DOE believes that the interim standardswill make more obvious the interaction between the requirements for differentbuilding subsystems, permit increased designer flexibility, and producemore energy efficient and cost-effective commercial and multi-family highrise residential buildings.The research employed to develop the interim standards comprised five majorelements performed sequentially but with considerable overlap: (1) Evaluationof ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980 and the identification of its problemareas; (2) basic research to develop improvements; (3) the test for energyconservation and economic effectiveness, (4) the formulation of a DraftStandard that would provide the basis for proposed interim standards forFederal use concurrent with promoting its voluntary use in the privatesector, and (5) extensive analysis of the provisions of the Draft Standardfollowed by additional research in key areas such as envelopes and lighting.The provisions of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980, the baseline standards,were evaluated by conducting a careful line by line review of the language,by investigating reported problems encountered in the application of thestandards, and by rigorous testing of its energy and economic implicationson 10 test buildings. This testing involved applying ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard90A-1980 to ten real building designs. Plans for the buildings were re-configuredfor compliance with both ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-75 and 90A-1980 ineach of eight cities. DOE-2.1B, a computerized and verified analysis andresearch tool developed by DOE and widely used by building design groups,was used to evaluate and identify potential cost-effective improvementsto ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980. This evaluation of energy and economic impacts revealed numerous areaswhere the standards could be improved. Envelope requirements did not addressthe real energy issues in modern buildings and restricted designer flexibility.Many of the most important energy consumption determinants, such as externalbuilding orientation and configuration, glass placement, shading, and theneed to match the envelope design to internal loads, were entirely ignored.The major problem associated with HVAC systems centered on system selection.Something needed to be done to encourage the selection of the most cost-effectiveand energy-efficient systems during the design process. In addition, abetter way to apply the air transport factor to system design was needed.Also, the need to modify the lighting system requirements became apparent,with the more obvious changes being in the areas of compliance complexityand lower lighting power densities. Following completion of the Draft Standard, DOE and ASHRAE/IES separatelyfollowed a path of additional research. Throughout this period, which beganin 1984, DOE and ASHRAE/IES have jointly shared the information createdfrom new research, public comments received on proposed drafts, and therationale and analysis supporting responses to comments. Therefore, theDOE interim standards and the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1P contain manysimilarities. However, the interim standards are written primarily forFederal agencies and are provided only as voluntary guidelines for thenon-Federal sectors.The interim standards contain minimum requirements that are mandatory forFederal agencies only. As such, the heads of Federal construction agenciesmust, within 180 days of today's promulgation, either adopt the interimstandards or indicate that the standards currently in use by their agencymeet or exceed the interim standards. In addition, Federal agencies arebound by the provisions of Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 436 that require thehead of each Federal agency responsible for the construction of Federalbuildings to assure that the decision-making process for the design ofnew buildings employs a specified methodology for estimating and comparingthe life-cycle cost of Federal buildings and for determining life-cyclecost-effectiveness. A more detailed description of the interim standards is presented below,together with discussion of certain specific comments from members of thepublic, as well as identification of technical changes that have been madeto the proposed version of the interim standards.B. Section by Section Analysis of the Interim Standards (With Major TechnicalChanges)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 435.097: Purpose</ITAG>Section 435.097: The interim standards are designed to achieve the maximumpracticable improvements in energy efficiency and increases in the useof non-depletable sources of energy. In addition, Federal agencies adoptingenergy conservation standards for new building construction must complywith Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 436, which requires that construction belife-cycle cost-effective.These regulations provide that, except in the case of Federal buildings,use of the interim standards is voluntary. However, DOE recommends useof these interim standards for the design of energy efficient non-Federalnew commercial and multi-family high rise residential buildings. The interimstandards promulgated today will be used by a Federal agency for the designof a new commercial building or a multi-family residential building, ofthree or more stories, constructed by or for the use of a Federal agency.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 435.098: Scope</ITAG>Section 435.098 provides that the design requirements do not apply to acommercial building or spaces within a commercial building with high processloads, manufactured homes, single family residences, and low-rise multi-familyresidential buildings of less than three stories.In the proposed interim standards, buildings used for industrial purposesand spaces within buildings used for industrial and commercial processesthat have substantial energy requirements unrelated to space conditioningand lighting were exempted. Many who commented felt that the terms industrialpurpose and process were insufficiently defined. The Section has been rewrittenby stating the conditions under which spaces used for industrial purposesand processes would be exempted.Preliminary results of the analysis, conducted in developing the proposal,indicated that compliance with the provisions of the proposed interim standardswill provide a range of 15% to 30% in annual energy savings to Federalagencies constructing office buildings, and smaller but still significantsavings will be realized in other types of commercial building categories.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 435.099: General Definitions and Acronyms</ITAG>Section 435.099 provides a listing of all the general definitions and acronymsused in the text of the proposed interim standards. Several definitionsand acronyms have been added since the proposed interim standards werepublished. The additions were made in response to public comment requestingfurther clarification of terms used in the interim standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 435.100: Explanation of Numbering System for Standards</ITAG>Section 435.100 provides an explanation of the unique numbering systemused in the interim standards. The interim standards uses a combinationof numbering systems employed by the Code of Federal Regulations and asystem commonly used by voluntary standards organizations. The headingsof each section will have a number, such as 435.109 which identifies theService Water Heating Systems section. This number designates the sectionas a proposed section of Chapter II of Title of the Code of Federal Regulations.Within each section, a decimal system more common to the building industryis used, such as 9.4.2. This number identifies a specific subsection inProposed Section 435.109. For purposes of clarity, the first five digitsare dropped from the subsection number. <ITAG tagnum="81"/><T4>5. Section 435.101: Implementation and Compliance Procedures for FederalAgencies</T4>This section prescribes the process for meeting the requirements of theproposed rule. It imposes the requirements of the interim standards oneach Federal agency responsible for the construction of a Federal commercialor multi-family high rise residential building. The section does not necessarilyapply to those in the non-Federal sector proposing to use the interim standards.It imposes both design requirements and a life-cycle costing requirement.The design requirements call for the designer to apply the general andspecific Principles of Effective Energy Building Design, employ the minimumcriteria for good practice prescribed in each proposed section from 3.0through 10.0 and select an appropriate design compliance method.The alternative compliance methods that a designer may choose from includeprescriptive, system performance, and building energy cost budget or energybudget methods. The section provides suggested selection criteria for useof each of the paths. This criteria is merely instructional and the designer/builderhas the option of the most suitable choice.1. The prescriptive alternative specifies criteria for particular buildingelements, such as the attributes of the building envelope, lighting powerallowances for specific building types, or the types of controls that mustbe used for HVAC system control.2. The system performance alternative specifies criteria for the designof the load reduction, energy distribution, and energy-using and transfersystems of buildings. For lighting it provides a procedure for determininglighting power densities for specific spaces and areas. For the buildingexterior envelope, this section considers a number of factors importantto energy conserving thermal and daylighting envelope design across a rangeof building functions and climates.3. The two building energy alternatives provide for a building design whosecalculated annual energy consumption is less than or equal to the calculatedconsumption of a building that meets the prescriptive or system performancerequirements, but which does not meet the specific requirements of thosecompliance paths.Section 435.101 also permits an interchangeable approach that permits adesigner to select between the prescriptive and system performance methods.The selection of a compliance method requires consideration of the advantagesand disadvantages of each method. The prescriptive alternative affordssimplicity of calculations at the expense of design flexibility. The prescriptivecriteria method requires the minimum amount of calculation and effort toachieve compliance, but permits only a few trade-offs or optimization procedures.The system performance criteria can be the method of choice when a moreinnovative design is required, or when the prescriptive method does notprovide the necessary flexibility. It requires some increased (manual)calculation compared with the prescriptive method. This method is expectedto be particularly useful in locations where high electric demand or peakfuel consumption carry a high economic or social burden. This method requiresthe incorporation of lighting and HVAC controls to insure that, even thoughpeak use is specified, the duration of use is also within acceptable bounds.The building energy methods allow compliance with even the most innovativedesign concepts to meet the proposed interim standards. However, in mostcases, it will require the use of a computer energy simulation programto model building energy use in accordance with the building loads andthe proposed schedules of operation. The building energy methods are notinterchangeable with the other compliance methods. Once selected, one orthe other must be used consistently throughout the design process.The widespread use of prescriptive criteria tends to inhibit the designof innovative and creative building subsystems since detailed componentspecifications are the basis of the criteria. The building energy methodsof compliance are far more flexible, even though they are more demandingin terms of computations. However, the rapid promulgation of suitable micro-processor-basedbuilding energy programs is making this procedure suitable for an increasinglylarge number of smaller buildings.The interim standards have already been analyzed for life-cycle cost-effectivenessand have been found to be cost-effective for the buildings tested. However,at the present time there is an additional life-cycle costing requirementthat applies only to Federal agencies. It provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The head of each Federal agency responsible for the construction ofFederal buildings shall also assure that the decision-making process forthe design of the building shall employ the methodology for estimatingand comparing the life-cycle cost of Federal buildings and for determininglife-cycle cost-effectiveness prescribed in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 436.</ITAG>The language in Paragraph 1.1.2 of this Section merely calls attentionto the existing Federal agency life-cycle costing requirements of SubpartA of 10 CFR Part 436. It does not add additional life-cycle costing requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Section 435.102: Principles of Effective Energy Building Design</ITAG>This section establishes the fundamental principles of energy conservingdesign practices and presents design strategies to help accomplish theobjectives. It addresses the interactions among systems, a concept thatis in fact ignored by component-based or system-based energy standards.The section was added to provide a framework for good design practices.It reflects DOE's recognition that the ultimate objective of energy efficientdesign requires a designer to make careful evaluations of energy requirementsand use good professional judgment. The criteria found in andSection; 435.102are not minimum requirements; rather they are guidance to the designer.The section provides the designer with additional information on the kindsof actions needed to develop an energy conserving building design.The principles encouraging good design practice are stated as follows:andbullet; Minimize the impact on functional requirements.andbullet; Reduce loads.andbullet; Reclaim waste energy where possible.andbullet; Use non-depletable sources of energy where possible.andbullet; Improve transport system efficiency.andbullet; Improve energy using system efficiency.andbullet; Control operation and scheduling of systems.andbullet; Optimize the interaction of the above.The design procedures and specific strategies that would be used to accomplishthe conservation objectives that underlie the above principles are presentedsequentially so as to roughly parallel the building design process. Thespecific strategies are found in each subsequent section.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Section 435.103: Lighting</ITAG>This proposed section identifies the scope of the lighting requirements,principles for effective lighting design, minimum lighting criteria andthe procedures for complying with either the prescriptive or system performancelighting requirements.<T3>3.1 General. </T3>This subsection identifies the types of rooms, spacesand areas of a building that are included by the interim standards. Basically,only interior spaces, building exteriors and grounds where lighting isenergized through the building's electrical service are covered by thestandards. There are several exceptions to the types of spaces coveredand a few of these, such as building exteriors and roads and grounds, andoutdoor processing facilities, have been amended.This subsection also identifies the Building or Facility Lighting PowerAllowance for a proposed design, the procedures by which designers cantake credit for Daylighting, and the requirements for compliance with thelighting section.<T3>3.2 Principles of Design. </T3>The principles to be applied with respectto lighting include such strategies as:andbullet; Reduction of actual demand load rather than just the apparentconnected load.andbullet; Use of more efficient lamps with appropriate luminous efficacy,life expectancy, spectrum distribution and color rendering characteristics.Also consideration of light distribution, glare control and visual characteristics.andbullet; Use of more efficient ballasts for fluorescent and HID lamps.andbullet; Use of luminaires with heat removal and heat recovery capabilities.andbullet; Illumination required for tasks limited to the location of thetask and from a direction that minimizes glare.andbullet; Appropriate use of indirect lighting with schemes that createreasonably uniform ceiling luminances.andbullet; Reduction of light absorption.andbullet; Consideration of appropriate uses for daylighting, local tasklighting or ambient lighting together with the proper use of controls.andbullet; Limitations on the use of lower efficiency lamps.Several editorial comments were made on this section and the majority ofthem included in the interim standards.<T3>3.3 Minimum Requirements. </T3>Minimum requirements have been specifiedfor the use of the following:andbullet; Lighting controls; andandbullet; Fluorescent lamp ballasts.Lighting requirements for Exterior Lighting power have shifted to the prescriptivecompliance path of Section 3.4. If the system performance path is chosenby a designer, Section 3.5 refers to the applicable exterior lighting subsectionin Section 3.4 for criteria. The minimum requirements have been revisedsignificantly from an editorial standpoint. The revisions will simplifythe compliance process. Revisions include clarification of the complianceprocess, a reduction in the number of tables, and a straightforward explanationof the prescriptive and system performance compliance paths.<T3>3.4 Prescriptive Compliance Alternative. </T3>This subsection providesa prescriptive procedure for determining the upper power limits for illuminationsystems installed inside and on the exterior of new commercial and multi-familyhigh rise residential buildings. It also serves as a basis for calculatingthe lighting heat gain and energy usage of buildings. This method prescribesa maximum allowable unit power density for lighting by building type, fora limited number of building types as listed in specified tables. Thereis no recognition of specific makeup of spaces and activities within thebuilding. The procedure is not to be used as a lighting design procedurebut as a method of determining the lighting power limit.Several editorial changes have been made on this subsection. The most prominentis the deletion of two subsections. The two, Lighting Equipment and LampEfficiency, were judged to be lacking in solid and documentable information.Although some felt that the proposed requirements were too stringent andothers felt they were too lax, parties on both sides of the issue feltthat the subsections were not appropriately placed in the prescriptivecriteria. DOE has revised the principles section (3.2) to reflect the benefitsof using luminaire and ballast efficiencies in the design of buildingsand has placed the proposed tables in an attachment to the section as examples.<T3>3.5 System Performance Compliance Alternative.</T3> This subsectionspells out a system performance procedure for determining the upper lightingpower limits for buildings, roads and grounds. It also provides a basisfor calculating the lighting heat gain and energy usage of individual rooms,spaces and areas as well as the total building. The procedure used in thissubsection is known as the Unit Power Density procedure and it establishesthe lighting power limit for building interiors plus the lighting powerallowance for building exteriors and roads/grounds. Once the lighting powerlimit for a building has been determined, the designer shall strive todesign lighting systems that will provide effective and pleasing visualenvironment without exceeding the lighting power limit. No specific commentswere raised on this section.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Section 435.104: Auxiliary Systems and Equipment</ITAG>This section identifies the scope, principles and minimum requirementsfor auxiliary systems and equipment in buildings.<T3>4.1 General.</T3> Even though their impact upon the internal loadsof most buildings is usually limited, design principles and minimum requirementsfor auxiliary systems and equipment were found to be useful. DOE receivedthree comments requesting the deletion of the entire section, but stillbelieves the requirements are necessary. The minimum requirements for transportationand freeze protection systems and retail food and food service refrigerationare important because they effect significant energy using systems notcovered elsewhere by standards. For example, the standards require thatfood refrigeration systems match capacity with loads and not be oversized,and also require heat recovery from such systems and apply them to spaceconditioning use where applicable.<T3>4.2 Principles of Design.</T3> The principles of effective energy conservingdesign that are applicable to this system are contained in andSection; 435.102,Principles of Effective Energy Conserving Building Design.<T3>4.3 Minimum Requirements.</T3> The minimum requirements for auxiliarysystems and equipment cover:andbullet; Transportation systems;andbullet; Freeze protection systems; andandbullet; Retail food and food service refrigeration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Minor changes have been made to paragraph 4.3.3.2 revising energy(heat) recovery requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Section 435.105: Building Envelope</ITAG>This section identifies the scope, design principles, minimum requirements,prescriptive and system performance methods for building envelopes.<T3>5.1 General.</T3> The building envelope requirements of this subsectionare for determining compliance with the interim standards. They are notintended to replace the building loads calculations procedures in publicationssuch as the <T3>ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume.</T3><T3>5.2 Principles of Design.</T3> The principles to be applied with respectto building envelope include such strategies as:andbullet; Balancing of building loads between and among the internal andexternal loads.andbullet; Control of conduction and convection.andbullet; Control of radiation.andbullet; Control of internal loads.andbullet; Balancing and minimizing the thermal impact of equipment and appliances.andbullet; Control of high ventilation loads.DOE believes that the principles are an important feature of the envelopesection of the interim standards because they provide designers with additionalinformation on energy conservation strategies that cannot be quantifiedas part of the standards. In order to strengthen the principles section,DOE has made several editorial changes as suggested by those who commented.The most significant change was the deletion of paragraph 5.2.1.6.1. Thisparagraph was a description of how balance points are an integral partof building design. Several who commented on the interim standards foundthe paragraph extraneous and out of context, therefore it has been dropped.<T3>5.3 Minimum Requirements.</T3> Minimum requirements for the buildingenvelope have been set for the following:andbullet; Overall Thermal Transmittance (U<T2>o</T2>) of the Building Envelope Above Grade Assembly;andbullet; A new paragraph on the Thermal Transmittance (R) of Each IndividualPath of the Envelope Assembly;andbullet; Thermal Transmittance (U<T2>i</T2>) of an Individual Path through an Envelope Assembly, includingFenestration;andbullet; Gross Area of Envelope Components;andbullet; Shading Coefficients;andbullet; Air Leakage and Moisture Migration; andandbullet; Shell Buildings.Several editorial changes were suggested by those who commented on theproposed interim standards. DOE appreciates the diligence with which thesechanges have been offered and has made many of the changes in the text.<T3>5.4 Prescriptive Compliance Alternative. </T3>This subsection requiresthe use of Alternate Component Packages (ACP) that prescribe precalculatedminimum criteria for elements of the exterior envelope of new commercialand multi-family high rise residential buildings in locations having lessthan 15,000 heating degree days (base 65 anddegrees;F). The criteria considervariations important to thermal envelope design including fenestration,shading, thermal mass, daylighting, internal loads and climate ranges.Several changes have been made to the ACP tables based on public commentsand new research. The tables have been updated based on new available reserveddata on thermal mass. These changes have primarily been for colder climates.In addition, the format of the ACP tables has been changed to allow allrelevant information for a climate area to be placed on one table. In theproposed standards, the user would have had to refer to several tables.The language in this section has been modified to correspond with the newformat of the ACP tables.DOE received several comments that the Receptacle Power Densities in Table5.4-30 (now Table 5.4-32) were too low based on the fact that U.S. buildingsare equipped with an increasing number of electronic products. DOE wascognizant of this fact when the research to develop the interim standardswas conducted and incorporated some sensitivity into its research. Basedon the findings of its research it still believes that the receptacle powerdensities are adequate.<T3>5.5 System Performance Compliance Alternative. </T3>This subsectionprovides a number of criteria important in energy conserving thermal envelopesystems design across a range of building functions and climates. The systemperformance approach requires the application of specified criteria forthe following factors:andbullet; Roof Thermal Transmittance;andbullet; Floor Thermal Transmittance;andbullet; Thermal Transmittance for Walls Below Grade;andbullet; Thermal Transmittance for Opaque Walls Enclosing Conditioned SpacesExposed to Interior Unconditioned Spaces;andbullet; External Wall Criteria for Heating and Cooling;andbullet; Wall Heating and Cooling Compliance Values;andbullet; Constraints on thermal transmittance values;andbullet; Lighting and equipment power densities;andbullet; Daylighting; andandbullet; Thermal mass.DOE received one comment complaining that the roof values are too low.DOE has analyzed the material provided in support of this comment and doesnot believe the commenter's recommendations are supported by the citedstudy because it does not provide enough relevant information on whichto base the change. DOE, through its own research, believes that the roofvalues used correspond to good practice and are readily achievable.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Section 435.106: Electric Power and Distribution</ITAG>This section identifies the scope, design principles, minimum requirementsfor the electric power and distribution system. Included are specific requirementsfor electrical distribution systems, transformers, electric motors, andoperation and maintenance systems. It should be noted that the sectionhas undergone many editorial changes. These changes reflect the amendmentsoffered by those who commented. They were made to clarify the languageused in the section. For example, language has been added to clarify electricaldistribution requirements of multi-tenant buildings. Another modificationclarifies the standards to be used in rating different types of electricalmotors.<T3>6.1 General. </T3>Emergency systems do not have to comply with therequirements of this section.<T3>6.2 Principles of Design. </T3>The specific design principles to beapplied with respect to electric power and distribution systems includesuch strategies as:andbullet; Consideration of the sizing of transformers and generating unitsto assure that they are close to the actual anticipated load.andbullet; Minimization of the use of distribution system transformers.andbullet; Submetering of tenant facilities.<T3>6.3 Minimum Requirements. </T3>Minimum electric power and distributionrequirements have been set for the following:andbullet; Submetering of electrical distribution systems;andbullet; Transformers;andbullet; Electric motors; andandbullet; Operation and maintenance of electrical systems.<ITAG tagnum="81">11.

Systems that recover heat can be usedin place of larger systems that require more fossil fuel.<T3>7.3 Minimum Requirements. </T3>Minimum requirements for the building'sHVAC System have been set for the following:andbullet; Calculation Procedures;andbullet; System and Equipment Sizing;andbullet; Separate Air Distribution Systems;andbullet; Temperature Controls;andbullet; Off-hour Controls;andbullet; Humidity Controls; andandbullet; Materials and Construction.Please note that Tables 7.3-1, Minimum Pipe Insulation, and 7.3-2, MinimumDuct Insulation, have been revised to reflect updated information.<T3>7.4 Prescriptive Compliance Alternative. </T3>This subsection providesthe criteria for the design of the HVAC Systems using the prescriptivepath. Prescriptive criteria is provided for the following:andbullet; Zone controls;andbullet; Economizer controls; andandbullet; System design requirements.A new andSection; 7.4.6, System Temperature Reset Controls has been added.<ITAG tagnum="81">12.

It should be noted that while equipmentefficiencies for 1984, 1988, and 1992 have been considered for this section,the rule requires Federal agencies to use the more stringent 1992 equipmentefficiencies. HVAC equipment that meet the 1992 efficiencies are alreadyon the market. By employing the more stringent efficiencies, the standardsrequire that Federal agencies become a model for equipment energy efficiency.<T3>8.2 Principles of Design.</T3> The principles to be applied with respectto HVAC Equipment include such strategies as: andbullet; Allowance for HVAC equipment operation at the highest efficiencyrates.andbullet; Ascertainment of the rate of energy inputs and the heating orcooling outputs of all HVAC equipment.<T3>8.3 Minimum Requirements.</T3> Minimum requirements for the building'sHVAC Equipment have been set for the following:andbullet; Equipment performance;andbullet; Field assembled equipment and components;andbullet; Equipment controls;andbullet; Comfort heating equipment; andandbullet; Maintenance.As part of the section, minimum efficiencies have been established fora wide variety of HVAC options.

It has much more stringentmetering, monitoring, and testing requirements. This was done to provideagencies with information necessary to assure the building is operatedat its designed efficiency and permit prompt identification and quantificationof problems. It will also ensure that Federal agencies have the informationon new buildings to meet their reporting responsibilities under ExecutiveOrder 12003 (June 20, 1977) and the National Energy Conservation Act of1978, Pub. L. 95-619.<ITAG tagnum="81">15. Section 435.111: Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative</ITAG>This section sets forth the requirements for using one of two alternativemethods of whole building performance compliance. This alternative, asopposed to the one found in andSection; 435.112, uses local monthly energycosts as a basis. It is particularly effective for builders of speculativeor tenant occupied buildings. Compliance under this building energy pathrequires detailed energy analyses of the proposed design (referred to asthe ``design energy cost'') and comparison against an energy cost budget.Compliance is achieved when the estimated design energy cost is less thanor equal to the energy cost budget. Section 435.111 provides instructionsfor determining the budget and for calculating energy analysis of prototypeor reference building designs configured to meet the prescriptive or systemsrequirements of the standards. It should be noted that the language inthis section has been considerably revised since the publication of theproposed interim standards. The changes are editorial. They have been madeto clarify the intent and compliance procedures of the section.This approach allows a designer maximum flexibility in the design process,while ensuring that the building is designed to consume no more energythan is allowed under the other compliance paths. This path provides anopportunity for the energy conservation benefits of innovative designs,materials, and equipment to be used when they cannot be evaluated adequatelyunder either the prescriptive or system performance procedures. Building energy compliance analyses are not required for proposed designsthat meet either the prescriptive or system performance compliance paths.This compliance path is one of four alternative paths. It may be used asan alternative for those designs that fail to meet either the prescriptiveor system requirements of the ten previous sections.Designers are encouraged to employ the proposed building energy compliancepath set forth in this section for evaluating proposed design alternatives,in preference to using the prescriptive and system performance paths. Usingthis path enables the designer to establish the relative effectivenessof each design alternative in saving energy, thus providing a reliableenergy basis upon which the building owner and designer may select onedesign over another. <ITAG tagnum="81">16. Section 435.112: Building Energy Compliance Alternative</ITAG>This section is constructed under the same basic approach as that foundin andSection; 435.111. It too provides an alternative path for compliancewith the interim standards that allows flexibility in the design of buildings.However, compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing thatthe calculated annual energy usage for the proposed building design isequal to or less than a calculated design energy use target.A life-cycle cost economic analysis is required to evaluate alternativefuel sources and energy reduction strategies. This analysis is used todetermine the feasible alternatives for energy sources of the design'sHVAC systems, service hot water and process loads. Fuel sources selectedfor the proposed design and prototype or reference buildings are determinedby considering the energy cost and other cost and benefits that occur duringthe expected economic life of the alternative. The procedures set forthin Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 436 are used to make the determination. Oncethe analysis is completed, the user is directed to compare the total life-cyclecost of each energy source alternative. The alternative with the lowesttotal life-cycle cost must be chosen as the energy source for the proposeduse. During the compliance process, when the proposed design is comparedto the prototype or reference building, the same subsystems and fuel sourcesare used so that the subsystems of each correspond.Table 12-1 contains fuel conversion factors for computing the energy budgetfor and the design annual energy use of the proposed design. In this compliancealternative, energy consumption is measured at the building five foot linefor all fuels, therefore ``site'' rather than ``source'' conversion factorsare specified for certain fuels in Table 12-1. This was done on the assumptionthat, in the equivalent energy consumption path, the comparison of proposeddesigns and prototype and reference buildings, with similar subsystemsand fuel types, minimizes the influence of the conversion number. In addition,it was felt that architects and engineers were more familiar with ``site''factors. However, it has been the policy of the Department to use ``source''conversion factors when conducting national policy studies on fuel useand energy savings potential and when measuring the impact of energy conservationprograms. This has been done because ``site'' factors do not account forthe conversion and transmission losses inherent in the use of some fuels.This policy will continue with respect to national studies.The same basic procedures used in andSection; 435.111 are also used in andSection;435.112 with some minor exceptions. The design is defined by the energythat would be consumed within the five foot line of a proposed buildingper square foot over a 24 hour, 365-day year and specified operating hours.The estimated design energy use is then compared to a calculated energyuse target determined by calculating the annual energy usage for a prototypeor reference building that is configured to comply with the standards.The approach would normally be favored by governmental entities and largeowners who would be interested in tracking energy use over the life ofa building. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Summary of Public Comment Received on the May 6, 1987, Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) and DOE Responses</ITAG>A. SummaryOn May 6, 1987, DOE issued a Notice of Public Rulemaking (52 FR 17051 <T3> et seq</T3>.) to afford the public an opportunity to comment on theproposed interim standards for new commercial and multi-family high risebuildings. At the close of a 90 day comment period, DOE had received responsesfrom 135 individuals, firms, and organizations. Many of the comments indicateda favorable response to the format used and the fact that DOE developedinterim standards that were parallel and of similar technical content tothose standards being developed by private sector organizations. Becausemost of those who commented had multiple comments, total comments numberedapproximately 630. The comments dealt primarily with specific sectionsof the interim standards, although there were some general comments. Thesecomments are discussed below.B. General Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Time Extension</ITAG>DOE received three comments requesting an extension of the comment period.Those who commented indicated that the complexity of the proposed interimstandards prevented an in-depth review and therefore requested additionaltime.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE considered an extension of time, but declinedbecause of the relatively few number of requests indicating that most whowished to comment had sufficient time. Comments were received by all threerequesting time extensions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. DOE Interim Standards vs. ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1P</ITAG>DOE received sixteen comments related to the differences between the proposedinterim standards and the proposed ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1P. Severalwho commented suggested that DOE employ the same consensus review and commentprocess used by ASHRAE. Another questioned the use of DOE standards asmodel energy codes. Many of those who commented suggested that DOE waituntil the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1P is finalized and then promulgatethat standard verbatim. Finally, one person who commented suggested thatDOE should be completely different from the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES standard becauseof the ``controversy'' surrounding that standard.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The interim standards are promulgated under a systemadopted by the Federal government for all public rulemakings. This systemdictates that any or all individuals or organizations are invited to providecomment on a Federal rulemaking.It is not DOE's intention that the interim standards become model energycodes. Rather, they are established as guidelines from which model energycodes may be developed. As has been stated previously, the interim standardsare mandatory only for Federal agencies and voluntary for the non-Federalsector.DOE intends that the interim standards be complementary to the privatesector standards established by voluntary industry organizations such asASHRAE and IES. It does so because it believes that the nation is betterserved by consistent energy conservation standards. However, it recognizesthat federal construction practice is somewhat different than that foundin private industry. For example, financing processes and laws governingfederal construction and building operation are quite different and requiresome unique considerations. Therefore, the DOE interim standards will notbe the exact parallel of those standards prepared exclusively for othersectors.Finally, DOE believes that the lengthy process to develop the interim standardswas very valuable and that the interim standards are practical tools tohelp save energy. The computer aids that will be provided to interestedentities as technical support documents greatly enhance the ``usability''of the standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Practicality of Interim Standards</ITAG>Six who commented questioned the practicality of the proposed interim standards.One said compliance was impossible. Others said it was overly complicatedand would increase first-costs of buildings. Finally, another said it favoreddesigns using natural gas for heating and was unfair to electricity.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The standards were prepared from an analytical standpoint.It was DOE's intention to address the complex interactions within a building,especially those within the building envelope and lighting systems. Itwas also important to develop several compliance paths in order to increasedesigner flexibility. This has led to standards that appear far more complexthan earlier prescriptive standards. In fact the standards can be far lesscomplicated because the designer must only choose one compliance path andbecause DOE has prepared several computer programs to assist in makingthe standard calculations of each component section.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. ``Site'' vs. ``Source'' Energy</ITAG>DOE received four comments on this issue. Three who commented favored ``site''over ``source'' energy; the other preferred ``source''. The person opposedsaid that ``site'' favored electricity as a fuel.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE believes that the original decision to use life-cyclecosting to select HVAC, service water heating, and process equipment fuelsin andSection; 12.0 remains valid. For this compliance alternative, it isalso appropriate to only consider energy as it is delivered to within thefive-foot line of the building site. Therefore, fuel selection is heldconstant for both the Prototype or Reference Building and the ProposedDesign when determining compliance.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. General Comments_Section 435.98</ITAG>a. Process Energy ExceptionDOE received four comments questioning the exclusion of buildings fromthe interim standards whose energy loads were not primarily for occupantcomfort and sanitation purposes. Most of those who commented were confusedby the wording used in the exclusion.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>It is DOE's intent to include energy related tooccupant comfort on sanitation (service hot water) with exceptions onlywhere that criteria will result in significant impact on operations inthe building that fall outside the intended scope of the interim standards.Section 435.98 has been revised to clarify the exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. General Comments_Section 435.101</ITAG>a. Standard Reporting ProceduresA comment was received requesting DOE to provide standardized reportingprocedures for Federal agencies in their adoption of the interim standards.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> The statutory mandate under which DOE promulgatedthe interim standards does not cover enforcement. Adoption and enforcementof the interim standards by Federal construction agencies is the responsibilityof the heads of those agencies.b. Cost-Effectiveness of the Interim StandardsDOE received four comments suggesting that language in andSection; 435.101be amended to require that the standards be life-cycle cost-effective aswell as require the maximum practicable energy savings.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE agrees that cost-effectiveness is an importantpart of new building design criteria. However, its mandate was to establishstandards that promoted energy savings to the maximum extent practicable.In conducting the research that led to the formulation of the interim standards,one requirement was that the redesigned buildings being tested have a life-cyclecost equal to or lower than a building designed to existing industry standards.Therefore, DOE believes that the interim standards do consider cost-effectivenessin their make-up. Additionally, as was mentioned previously, Federal agenciesare required by Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 436 to conduct life-cycle costanalyses on each new building project. This requirement is listed in Section435.101, paragraph 1.1.3.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. General Comments_Section 435.103</ITAG>a. Support for Proposed LightingStandardsDOE received several comments on the general requirement levels of thelighting standards found in andSection; 435.103. An equal number of thosewho commented felt that the standards were appropriate given current technologyand design skills, as were those who were opposed to the levels. Thosein favor cited several examples of designs that easily met the criteria.Those opposed mostly agreed that the levels were achievable given currenttechnology, but that the skill level of most lighting designers was suchthat the lighting standards could not be universally met. Several of thoseopposed suggested the use of existing Illuminating Engineers Society ofNorth America guidelines or that additional research be conducted. <T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE agrees that many of the key components of optimallighting designs, given current technology, are still missing. These includemore information on spectral composition of lamplight, a more thoroughknowledge of lamp and ballast efficiencies and lighting maintenance, andthe proper use of automatic lighting controls. However, DOE believes thatthe minimum levels specified in the interim standards for current implementationare well within the capability of lighting designers. Therefore, with fewmodifications, the minimum levels will stand as written.b. Proposed 1992 Lighting LevelsIn its proposed interim standards, DOE published minimum lighting levelsfor both 1987 and 1992. Several who commented were opposed to the use of1992 levels as technically impractical and unsubstantiable. Others whocommented were in favor of the 1992 levels. In fact, one who commentedopposed the use of 1987 levels and would prefer that DOE utilize the proposed1992 levels immediately. <T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE will retain the 1992 lighting levels in itsinterim standards. It is convinced that the levels are currently achievableby good designers with current technology and will certainly be broadlyachievable beyond 1993 under programs of continued industry and professionaleducation. However, in the interest of those opposed, DOE will change theeffective date to 1993 and address the issue in-depth during the demonstrationprogram phase that will follow today's publication of the interim standards.c. Lighting ControlsDOE received several comments about lighting controls and switching requirements,and the credits allowed for automatic lighting controls. A few who commentedstated that the number of switches to be required per unit of electricitywas not economical. Others disagreed with requirements for switch and controlplacement. Still others disagreed with the ballast control requirements.A few who commented felt that the credits for controls allowed in proposedTable 3.3-3 were excessive. Others commented that areas equipped with automaticcontrols should have manual override switches for individual work centers.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE believes that the lighting control requirementsare equitable and has not made any changes to the number of controls required.It has, however, provided for some additional lighting control optionsand has made editorial changes to the standards where appropriate on therequirements and control placement. DOE also believes that the ballastefficacy factors are appropriate and has not made any changes to that subsection.Based on research conducted by DOE at its Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,DOE disagrees with the comment that the credits given for lighting controlsin proposed Table 3.3-3 were excessive. Properly used with fluorescentlamps, controls can have a great effect on energy consumption. DOE doesagree that controls used in conjunction with incandescent lamps are notas effective and therefore has not given credit for controls on incandescentlamps in new Table 3.3-1. DOE disagrees in concept with the comment onmanual overrides because excessive manual overrides can diminish the expectedenergy conservation effect of the automatic controls. DOE has made someeditorial changes that more clearly delineate the placement of manual controlsto ease the concerns of the commenters.d. Power Adjustment FactorsOne commenter requested the addition of Power Adjustment Factor credits(proposed Table 3.3-4) for energy saving lamps, high efficiency conventionalballasts and electronic ballasts.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> The purpose of the Power Adjustment Factor is togive credit for use of daylighting and other lighting strategies in thedesign of buildings. Since the interim standards are minimum standards,it is expected that the designer will use more efficient lighting and ballasttechnologies as they are cost beneficial.e. Unit Lighting Power AllowancesSeveral comments were received in regard to proposed Table 3.4-3 (now Table3.4-1), Unit Lighting Power Allowance, including a request to eliminatefactory spaces, to reverse the allowances for fast food and leisure fooddining, to provide better definitions for the building categories listed,and to place the lighting allowances at the minimum possible for maximumenergy conservation.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE has eliminated the factory requirements as theymay represent high process energy space which has been exempted from theseinterim standards. Please consult andSection; 435.098, General Definitionsand Acronyms for more information. DOE has further redefined the buildingcategories found in Table 3.4-3 (now Table 3.4-1) by combining four retailbuilding types into one category, retaining the mall concourse category,and adding a service establishment category. The building areas for eachtype now range up to 250,000 ft\2\ rather than 35,000 ft\2\. The lightingpower allowances have been adjusted to reflect the new space categories.Also Unit Lighting Power allowances have been added for the year 1993 sothat Table 3.4-1 would be consistent with the Unit Power Densities of andSection;3.5, the system performance criteria. DOE has not reversed the allowancesfor fast food and leisure dining as suggested because it believes thatthe order is correct.f. Interior and Exterior Lighting TradeoffsSeveral comments were made concerning the tradeoffs between interior andexterior lighting found in proposed paragraph 3.4.4.2.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> This language has been amended to consolidate allexterior lighting allowances into a single budget. Tradeoffs between interiorand exterior allowances are still not allowed in an effort to keep exteriorlighting at minimum necessary energy usage and so that interior lightinglevels not suffer because of higher exterior levels.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. General Comments_Section 435.105</ITAG>a. Minimum Requirements inEnvelope Section Not Regulatory GuidanceDOE received a few comments that stated that andSection; 5.3 was a ``philosophicalengineering discourse'' rather than minimum requirements.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE disagrees; while it is true that the sectionruns through several fundamentals of physics and engineering, it also containsspecific minimum requirements for the items listed above. b. Use of anddegrees;F (degrees Fahrenheit) vs. Fanddegrees; (Fahrenheit degrees)Several who commented were opposed to the use of Fanddegrees; throughoutthe text of Section 5.0 and the rest of the proposed interim standards.Most were opposed because F anddegrees; is not used in common building anddesign practice, although it may be proper in a physics laboratory.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE agrees to make the change throughout the interimstandards to maintain consistency in terminology and avoid confusion withinthe professions that will apply and implement the standards.c. Buildings in Climates Greater Than 15,000 HDD65DOE received several comments on the requirements for buildings designedfor colder climates. Several suggested that the U<T2>o</T2> values found in the envelope section for such buildings wereincorrect. Others requested specific requirements for buildings over 10,000HDD65 and 20,000 HDD65. A couple pointed out that the tables found in thesystem performance criteria section (Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-4) did nothave values for the colder climates. Another requested that skylights notbe allowed in communities above 58 degrees north latitude.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE realizes that the specifications for colderclimates were not complete in the proposed interim standards. In response,it has strengthened several paragraphs to correct the problems. Table 5.3-5,the requirements for locations with heating degree-days greater than 15,000,has been amended. Included as part of the amendment was a prohibition ofskylights in locations of greater than 15,000 HDD65. Also, Tables 5.5-1through 5.5-4 have been modified. Unfortunately, the lack of weather datafor the colder climates prevents the adoption of more specific requirements.d. Thermal Mass CreditsDOE received a few comments about the thermal mass credits. Some were infavor of retaining the credits and others were opposed. Most asked howthe credits were determined.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> There is a reference to the research that establishedthe credits in Appendix D to andSection; 435.105 entitled, ``Rules for ExternalWall Criteria''. The thermal mass analysis was documented in the peer reviewedpaper ``The Effects of Thermal Mass Exterior Walls on the Heating and CoolingLoads in Commercial Buildings'' by Wilcox, et al., published in the proceedingsof Thermal Performance of the Exterior Envelopes of Buildings III, DOE/ASHRAE/BTECC,December 1985, pp. 1187-1224. The analysis of thermal mass effects was performed using the same buildings,operating assumptions, internal gain assumptions, and glazing characteristicsas were used to study insulation, glazing U-value, glazing shading coefficient,daylighting and all the other aspects of the building envelope. Great carewas taken to ensure that the analysis was consistent. DOE sees no reasonto remove the only thermal mass aspect from the interim standards.e. Vapor RetardersOne person who commented suggested more detailed specifications for vaporretarders.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE believes that the current criteria are adequatewhen viewed in conjunction with the referenced material for a nationalstandard. Local climatic conditions may warrant more detailed criteria,but such criteria should not be imposed nationally.f. Shell BuildingsTwo comments were received which indicated that lighting power densitiesand equipment power densities for shell buildings, found in proposed Table5.3-4 were too low.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> They have been modified in the interim standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. General Comments_Section 435.106</ITAG>a. Opposition to Inclusionof SectionSeveral who commented on this section were opposed to one entire sectionof the interim standards being devoted to electric power. Their reasonsincluded the belief that electricity had been treated differently thanother fuels and that check-metering should be required for other fuel uses.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> Because electrical energy is such a critical ingredientin our way of life, we must consider every means of conserving its use.The almost complete reliance on electrical energy by building subsystemsis recognized by this separate section. The treatment is not intended tobe discriminatory since other types of equipment are addressed in othersections of the interim standards. DOE has included requirements for otherfuel types, including sub-metering requirements for natural gas, oil andsteam, in andSection;andSection; 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0. It believes the requirementsof the interim standards have been designed to minimize burden and maximizebenefits.The technical provision for check-metering is intended to facilitate energymanagement and not to encourage a building owner to act as a utility andcharge tenants for service. Such provisions do not constitute submetering,which may be in conflict with some local regulatory requirements. DOE alsobelieves there is informational value to check-metering even where permanentmetering is not warranted.Metering and measurement are essential to the proper operation of the building,as well as for checking on energy consumption. While the interim standardsdo not and cannot address operation, they do attempt to provide the operatorwith the proper tools for good operation and maintenance. Not all operatorsand owners will operate the building systems in the most appropriate waybut the increasing sophistication on the part of occupants and tenantsis causing owners to be more aware of the need for proper operating practice.b. Transformer RequirementsA few who commented found the transformer requirements of paragraph 6.3.2burdensome. This paragraph recommends that transformer efficiency shallbe considered in electrical distribution systems.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> Transformers are a part of most such systems. Theirno-load and part-load losses can be significant and should not be ignored.c. Electric MotorsA couple who commented indicated that the electric motors covered by theinterim standards serve a variety of applications and that some of theelectric motors covered serve purposes that are inappropriate for energyefficient motors. They recommended that a section be added to address performanceand use requirements other than efficiency to determine the choice of motor.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The purpose of the table is to provide minimum efficiencystandards for motors and not to require high efficiency motors, thereforethe section was not changed. However, reference has been made to a NationalElectrical Manufacturers Association publication for detailed design guidance.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. General Comments_Section 435.107</ITAG>a. Zoned Space ConditioningA few who commented felt that DOE should recognize the benefits of zonalspace conditioning for HVAC system design. <T3>DOE Response: </T3>The interim standards in no way preclude zonal systems.In fact, zonal systems inherently meet the provisions of andSection; 435.107,as they provide separate air distribution systems to every zone. The purposeof the section is to discourage the use of large central systems servingzones with very different load characteristics and in that way actuallyencourages zonal systems.b. Insulation LevelsA few who commented felt that insulation levels for piping and ductworkfound in andSection; 435.107 were below economic levels and should be increased.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The insulation requirements were based on an economicanalysis to determine the insulation thickness that results in the lowestlife-cycle cost. For example, Table 7.3-1 is a table of minimum insulationthicknesses listed as a function of fluid temperature range and nominalpipe size. For each fluid temperature range, a conductivity range is specifiedon which thicknesses in the Table were based. The conductivities representa broad range of commercially available insulation products, includingfiberglass and expanded foam.c. Thermal Storage Systems for Comfort CoolingOne who commented on this section suggested that DOE was missing a conservationopportunity by not making more use of thermal storage systems for comfortcooling.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE has recognized the benefits of thermal storagesystems for cooling and recommends, but does not require, them in andSection;435.108.d. Economizer CyclesA couple of commenters suggested that DOE investigate the increase in energyuse caused by increased fan transport energy and the elimination of heatreclaimed from the building, based on its economizer cycle and variableair volume systems requirements.One who commented suggested that an enthalpy economizer will show verylittle use in most of the country and if temperature controlled units areused, humidity control is completely lost. Another who commented felt thatair economizer systems are not cost-effective for units smaller than 5,000cfm. It was suggested that units with supply capacity of less than 3,000cfm or total cooling capacity of less than 90,000 Btu/h should be changedto 5,000 cfm or 134,000 Btu/h.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE believes economizers are the most generallyapplicable and effective energy conservation measure to take advantageof cool and cold weather cooling requirements characteristic of commericalbuildings. Heat recovery systems are only effective when heating loadsoccur simultaneously with cooling loads. Economizers reduce energy consumptionboth during cold weather and during mild weather when heating loads donot exist due to the generally high internal loads.DOE agrees in part with the comment on enthalpy economizers and has revisedthe economizer control section to allow calculations to determine whetheran enthalpy economizer is practical and useful in particular situations.In regard to the comment on air economizers, economizer controls are readilyand relatively inexpensively obtained for the size range required. Formost unitary products of this size range, economizers are factory installedoptions. DOE determined that economizers would therefore be cost-effectivein most applications.e. Oversizing of SystemsA few who commented found that in setting design conditions, no penaltyis given for maximizing of set-back and set-up temperature, therefore reasonableoversizing of the HVAC system is necessary. One who commented felt thatan exception should be allowed for oversizing equipment in a building whereplanned future expansion could be better served from an existing system.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The only oversizing permitted is the 10% safetyfactor of andSection; 7.3.1.9. The allowed 30% factor of andSection; 7.3.1.10is not oversizing but rather a simple and commonly used method for calculatingpickup loads. Pickup is a load that a system must be designed to meet ifsetback is used and reasonable warmup times are to be achieved.If a future expansion is designed at the time of the HVAC system design,then it could be considered part of the design load and not oversizing.However, it is believed that specific exceptions for future expansion wouldbe too vague to be enforceable; the scope and timing of expansion couldnot be tightly designed.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. General Comments_Section 435.108</ITAG>a. Uniform Equipment StandardsIt was felt by several that DOE should strive to establish equipment efficiencyrequirements at an acceptable high and uniform level, regardless of theequipment's fuel source. Accordingly, the interim standards should notattempt to dictate the type of energy or fuel selection for a particularapplication. <T3>DOE Response: </T3>There seems to be the belief of some respondentsthat the interim standards discriminate against electric energy. DOE believesthat the contrary is true. The interim standards recognize the almost completereliance of building systems on electrical energy and provides equitabletreatment for consideration of all energy sources. Because electric energyis such a key ingredient to our way of life, we need to consider meansto conserve its use for long-term needs. Such conservation will certainlybe required as these buildings go through their 40- to 50-year lifetimes,and varying degrees of energy scarcity are experienced.b. Agreement with NAECAMany who commented urged that the interim standards be revised to complywith the provisions of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA)of 1987. <T3>DOE Response: </T3>The interim standards are now based on the provisionsof NAECA.c. DOE Use of 1992 Efficiency RequirementsIn its interim standards, DOE has chosen to set efficiency levels at 1992minimum levels. This means that DOE has chosen to forego 1988 levels formore stringent standards. A few who commented objected to these levels.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE contends that the standards are primarily foruse by Federal agencies and that these agencies should become models forthe rest of the nation and design the most efficient buildings possiblein a life-cycle cost-effective manner. Since equipment bearing the 1992efficiencies are currently available and considered cost-effective, Federalagencies are required to meet these efficiencies in all new construction.Because the standards are voluntary for the non-Federal sector, a choicecan be made to utilize the 1988 equipment efficiencies found in proposedprivate sector standards.d. Equipment Omitted From Interim StandardsDOE received several comments about equipment that have seemingly beenomitted from the interim standards.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>There is no intent to encourage or discourage theuse of specific classes of equipment. Rather, those types of equipmentnot specifically included in andSection; 435.108 may qualify under eitherof the two Energy Budget compliance paths, andSection;andSection; 11.0 or 12.0.e. Electric Resistance HeatingA few who commented felt that electric resistance heating was unfairlysingled out because the only recommended use of electric resistance heatwas as a supplement to heat pump operation.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>In practice, any type (oil, gas, electric) fuelcould be used to supplement heat pump operation and should be regulatedto maximize system efficiency. Revisions have been made to the standardsthat allow the use of electric resistance heating in selected primary situationsand that allow other electric, gas, and oil furnaces to supplement heatpump operation.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. General Comments_Section 435.109</ITAG>a. Minimum Service Hot WaterPerformanceSeveral comments were received concerning the minimum performance tablesfound in this section. Those who commented suggested that the service waterheating standards comply with the provisions of the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE agrees and has made the appropriate changes.b. Standby Loss RequirementsDOE received a comment that the standby loss requirements in Table 9.3-1for residential oil water heaters are far too stringent.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>Current research results indicate that the levelsof stringency are well below the current state-of-the-art, that substantialimprovement in efficiency can be made, and that the efficiency requirementsof the interim standards are defensible.c. Heat Pump Water HeatersSeveral comments were received that requested the elimination of requirementsthat a heat pump water heater be used in all applications of electric waterheater where supply temperatures are under 145 anddegrees;F.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The interim standards make no assumptions aboutthe cost of electricity. Data and analysis reviewed by DOE show that heatpump water heaters can yield substantial improvements in efficiency comparedto resistance heat that are almost always economical. Clearly, there aresome conditions in which heat pump water heaters will not make economicsense, but no general prescriptions for such situations have been found.d. Thermostat ControlsDOE received a few comments on the requirements for thermostatic controlsfor service water heating. One comment suggested that andSection; 9.3.4.1is a meaningless requirement; all automatic water heaters have temperaturecontrols adjustable through a range of settings.Other comments indicated concern that lowering water temperature wouldincrease the likelihood of the production of organisms that cause diseasessuch as Legionnaires' Disease.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>The requirement stands because some water heatersare incapable of settings as low as 90 anddegrees;F. DOE believes that thelow settings will provide substantial energy savings for most types ofnon-residential buildings. For residential dwelling water heaters thatrarely are capable of settings below 110 anddegrees;F, an exception is provided.DOE agrees that the issues of health and safety are important and has raisedthe required thermostat settings to conform with health and safety standards.e. Removable Showerhead Flow RestrictorsDOE received a comment advocating that the restrictions on using removableshowerhead flow restrictors, in andSection; 9.3.4.2, be amended to allowfor their use. The rationale was that this requirement would eliminatethe major portion of all showerheads manufactured today.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>Since this is a design standard for Federal buildings,DOE will not make the change. DOE believes the potential for removal isso great that removable flow restrictors cannot be counted on unless somevandal-proof feature is required.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. General Comments_Section 435.110</ITAG>a. Minimum RequirementsDOE received a few comments concerning the requirements of this section,including a few that recommended that either additional guidance be providedon the use of central monitoring and control systems, or that the sectionbe deleted. Other comments requested that DOE temper its requirements forpost-construction testing for small buildings.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>DOE has taken these comments under considerationand will examine them and other requirements of this section during therequired demonstration period following promulgation of the Interim Standards.b. Metering RequirementsDOE received a few comments that the metering requirements of andSection;435.110 are not apropos. The first of these deals is the misconceptionthat DOE is exceeding its mandate by addressing utility metering. The secondconcerns the use of individual tenant meters; unless the individual tenantmeters are required for billing purposes, the commenter felt that the additionalexpense for meters in government facilities is generally not justified.Finally, it is suggested that some smaller buildings be exempted from therequirement for cost reasons.<T3>DOE Response: </T3>There seems to be a misunderstanding about the meteringprocess required by andSection; 435.110. It is not the intention of DOE totry to regulate utility meters. Rather it is DOE's intent to have each``distinct utility-provided fuel source'' metered. The purpose of the systemis to measure and record delivered energy so as to identify when and wheredesign energy use is being significantly exceeded and to permit timelycorrective action to be taken. Such meters will be used in analyzing andreporting energy use.With respect to tenant metering, when tenants are of a single Federal agencyand no separate billing is required, the agency is free to define tenantsto avoid unjustified cost/benefit results.Finally, DOE agrees that metering some small buildings would be overlycostly and has amended the interim standards accordingly.c. DOE Training for Federal AgenciesThroughout the comments, but most prominently in those comments directedtowards andSection; 435.110, requests were made for simplification of thecompliance process. <T3>DOE Response: </T3>As mentioned earlier, DOE intends to make availableeasy-to-use computer programs that will help in determining compliancewith the lighting, envelope, HVAC, and service hot water sections of theinterim standards. In addition, DOE would like to provide further guidancethrough educational workshops, seminars, etc. It is presently preparinga plan for the required demonstration program and will link its educationalplanning to the demonstration.d. Exemption for Fossil Fuel EquipmentA few who commented requested revision to andSection;andSection; 10.3.1 and10.3.2 which require individual meters for fossil fuel equipment. The commentssuggested that requiring individual meters for fossil fuel equipment inhigh rise apartment buildings is impractical and will slant installationsto electric equipment. <T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE believes that the proposed metering is consistentwith that for other fuels in the standard and has made no change in thisrequirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">14. General Comments_Section 435.111</ITAG>a. Deletion of andSection;435.111 and/or andSection; 435.112Several who commented suggested that DOE eliminate andSection; 435.111, the``Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative.'' Others commenting on andSection;435.112, the ``Building Energy Compliance Alternative,'' suggest that DOEeliminate that section and leave only andSection; 435.111. The disagreementscenter around the perceived reasons for the inclusion of two separate energypaths in the interim standards and the basis for each. Those who disagreewith the use of andSection; 435.111 see it as intended primarily for buildersof speculative or tenant-occupied buildings. Compliance under this alternativeuses local monthly energy costs as a basis. Their contention is that whilethe alternative does provide for more design flexibility, the annual energycost calculations ignore life-cycle costs. Others contend that the alternativediscriminates against electricity because it appears to be based on ``source''energy.Those suggesting that andSection; 435.112 be retained and andSection; 435.111deleted, present counter-arguments. They contend that DOE should focuson developing a method of accounting for the energy lost in the productionand transmission of each form of energy. Others complain that it will takea sophisticated computer user to contend with either path.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE disagrees with the basis for all these comments.It contends that neither path discriminates against any fuel types. Ratherit has presented two different compliance alternatives, each that providesmaximum design flexibility, that are easy-to-use, and that provide similarcriteria no matter which alternative is chosen. b. Modeling of CogenerationDOE received a comment on the modeling of cogeneration when using thissection. The proposed interim standards did not permit the sale of energyoff-site that was supplied by either cogeneration or renewable energy sourcesas a credit. It was contended that the paragraph will effectively eliminatethe use of cogeneration and renewable energy systems power in new buildingdesign.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE has not changed its provision and contends thatthe section allows the use of cogeneration and renewable energy sourcesand it only precludes using the proceeds from resale of electricity asa means of offsetting energy consumption costs for the building.c. Prototype Building RequirementsSeveral who commented oppose the andSection; 11.5 requirements for a PrototypeBuilding. The typical comment was that a Prototype Building will generallygive an unrealistic comparison with the Proposed Design of the building.Most suggested that the use of the Reference Building only is more appropriate.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> DOE believes that the Prototype Building defaultassumptions are needed to maintain consistency and to provide a standardmeans of comparison for all designers.<ITAG tagnum="81">15. General Comments_Section 435.112</ITAG>a. Update Life-Cycle CostRequirementsIt has been suggested by a couple who commented that DOE should amend itslife-cycle cost procedures, 10 CFR Part 436, to include the necessary provisionsfor non-government buildings.<T3>DOE Response:</T3> The life-cycle cost procedures, 10 CFR Part 436,are developed and intended for use by the Federal government only. Theyare part of the requirements of DOE's Federal Energy Management Program.DOE has no intention of incorporating a methodology for non-governmentbuildings. It suggests that private sector use of this section base itslife-cycle cost analysis on accepted procedures for private sector construction.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Technical Support Documents: Micro-Computer Programs That WillEase the Use of the Interim Standards</ITAG>Along with the interim standards DOE will issue several technical supportdocuments that will assist the users of the interim standards in determiningcompliance. Each program will be an exact duplicate of the requirementsand the compliance calculations contained in the relevant sections of theinterim standards. The computer programs include the following:andbullet; Lighting Program, inclusive of the prescriptive path, system performancepath, and the lighting requirements for roads and grounds;andbullet; Two (2) Envelope Programs, one each for the prescriptive path(ACP Tables) and for the system performance path; andandbullet; HVAC and Service Hot Water Program, inclusive of prescriptiverequirements (there is no system performance path for these areas).The technical support documents will be available from: National TechnicalInformation Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road,Springfield, Virginia 22161.The computer programs have been written in the ``C'' computer language.The compiled versions of the programs will be provided on a 5\1/4\ inchcomputer diskette, which will be accompanied by a user's manual. The programswill run on any MS-DOS compatible micro-computer, requiring only the MS-DOSoperating system. A listing of the source code will also be provided onrequest to DOE.To run the programs, the following equipment will be needed:andbullet; An IBM-PC, -XT, or -AT; COMPAQ; or MS-DOS compatible micro-computerwith at least 256K RAM memory, and a double-sided, double-density floppydisk drive or a double-sided, double-density floppy disk drive and a harddisk;andbullet;  A monochrome or color monitor;andbullet; An 8087 or 80287 or equivalent math coprocessor (optional); andandbullet; MS-DOS operating system, version 2.0 or later.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. National Environmental Policy ActDOE prepared and issued on May 6, 1987, concurrently with the proposedinterim standards, an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed interimstandards under the Implementing Regulations of the Council of EnvironmentalQuality (CEQ) (40 CFR Parts 1500-1800) and the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, (Pub. L. 91-190, 4221 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which requires agencies to conduct environmental assessmentswhen their regulations constitute a significant Federal action. A <T3>Finding of No Significant Impact </T3>was issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 52 FR 17224 <T3>et seq</T3>. on May 6, 1987. The Environmental Assessment concludedthat no significant impacts will result to the indoor or outdoor environmentsfrom implementing the Interim Voluntary Performance Standards for New Commercialand Multi-family High Rise Residential Buildings that are mandatory forFederal agencies. Based upon the findings in the Environmental Assessment,DOE determined the proposed interim standards do not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentwithin the meaning of NEPA.<T3>EPA Review:</T3> As required by section 7(a)(2), 15 U.S.C. 776(c)(2),of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, 15 U.S.C. 761 <T3>et seq.</T3>, a copy of this proposed rule was submitted to the Administratorof the Environmental Protection Agency for comments on the impact of theinterim rule on the quality of the environment. The following commentswere provided:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports the general goalof the rulemaking, which is to identify measures by which energy can beconserved. EPA has some specific comments concerning the potential environmentaleffects from radon within structures built to comply with DOE's performancestandards.The President signed the Indoor Radon Abatement Act on October 28, 1988.This law established a national goal that ``air within buildings in theUnited States should be as free of radon as the ambient air outside ofthe buildings'' and places a wide variety of new requirements on the EPAAdministrator toward meeting this goal.Several of the requirements established by the Act create areas of commoninterest between EPA and DOE with respect to the Interim Final Rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Section 304 (Model Construction Standards and Techniques)requires the Administrator to ``develop model construction standards andtechniques for controlling radon levels within new buildings.'' This sectionalso requires the Administrator to ``work to ensure that organizationsresponsible for developing national model building codes * * * adopt theAgency's model standards and techniques.'' EPA believes that the DOE standardsconstitute a ``national model building code.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Section 309 (Study of Radon in Federal Buildings) requiresall Federal agencies owning buildings to ``conduct a study for the purposeof determining the extent of radon contamination in such buildings.'' Thissection also requires the Administrator to ``identify and compile a listof areas * * * which have a high probability of including Federal buildingswhich have elevated levels of radon.'' This section also requires the Administratorto provide to the departments or agencies conducting studies guidance andrelated information concerning methods for reducing radon levels.</ITAG>The public good is best served if EPA's radon related requirements andDOE's conservation requirements mesh smoothly. While these are not mutuallyexclusive requirements, there is no assurance that the pursuit of one willnecessarily result in the accomplishment of the other. DOE's standardswere initially developed before EPA's radon protection mandate was establishedby law. EPA recommends that the appropriate staffs of both agencies engagein some dialogue to ensure that DOE's standards do not result in constructionrequirements that later have to be modified to conform to EPA radon reductionguidance.B. Executive Order No. 12291Section 3 of Executive Order No. 12291, 46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981,requires that DOE determine whether a proposed rule is a ``major rule''as defined by Section 1(b) of that Order, and prepare a preliminary regulatoryimpact analysis for rules which fall within that definition.DOE prepared an ``Economic Analysis,'' 52 FR 17065, May 6, 1987, whereinDOE reviewed the proposed Final Interim Rule. DOE has determined that therule will not have an annual effect on the national economy of $100 millionor more, nor certain other effects listed in the Order, and that the FinalInterim Rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the Order.The rule was submitted to the Director of the Office of Management andBudget for a 10-day review period as required by section 3(c)(3) of ExecutiveOrder No. 12291. The Director has concluded his review under that ExecutiveOrder.C. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603, 604) requires DOE to calculatethe effect its rulemaking will have on small businesses in the nation.DOE analyzed the small business impacts the rule would have, includingits impacts upon manufacturers of building and construction materials andequipment, architects, builders, construction companies and utilities.In accordance with the findings of Chapter 3 of the Economic Analysis,52 FR 17065, May 6, 1987, DOE certifies that the Interim Energy ConservationStandards for New Commercial and Multi-Family High Rise Residential Buildingswill not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.D. Paperwork Reduction ActNo information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed onthe public by the Final Interim Rule. Accordingly, authorizations are notrequired under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq., </T3>as amended, or its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part132.E. Federalism EffectsExecutive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulationsor rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on therelationship between the national government and the States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.If there are sufficient ``substantial direct effects,'' then ExecutiveOrder 12612 requires preparation of a Federalism Assessment to be usedin all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a regulationor a rule. Sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12612 set forth theprinciples, criteria, and requirements to be used in preparing a FederalismAssessment.The principal impacts of today's rule will be on commercial and multi-familyhigh rise residential buildings constructed by the Federal government.These interim standards are being promulgated pursuant to legislation thatstates ``except in the case of Federal buildings, voluntary performancestandards shall be developed solely as guidelines for the purpose of providingtechnical assistance for the design and construction of energy efficientbuildings.'' Therefore, the rule will not have a substantial direct effecton the States, the relationship between the States and Federal government,or distribution of the power and responsibilities among various levelsof government.F. Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974The interim rule references several building industry standards and requiresbuilding designers to use these standards in order to comply with the interimstandards.

numbering system for standards.</ITAG>(a) For purposes of this subpart, a derivative of two different numberingsystems will be used.(1) For the purpose of designating a section, the system employed in theCode of Federal Regulations (CFR) will be employed. The number ``435,''which signifies Part 435, Chapter II of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations,is used as a prefix for all section headings. The suffix is a two or threedigit number beginning with ``.97.'' For example, the lighting sectionof the standards is numbered andSection; 435.103.(2) Within each section, a numbering system common to many national voluntaryconsensus standards is used. This system was chosen because of its commonalityamong the buildings industry. A decimal system is used to denote sectionsand subsections. For example, andSection; 9.4.2 refers to section 9, subsection4, paragraph 2.(b) The hybrid numbering system is used for two purposes:(1) The use of the Code of Federal Regulation's numbering system allowsthe researcher using the CFR easy access to the standards.(2) The use of the second system allows the builder, designer, architector engineer easy access because they are used to the system employed.(c) To avoid confusion in the use of the two systems, andSection; 435.101through andSection; 435.112, the substantive technical sections of the standards,have been numbered so that the last two digits in the suffix designatethe section. For example, once the reader enters the body of andSection;435.105: Building Envelope, the number ``5'' is used to designate the section.References throughout the standard do not employ the ``435'' prefix butrather refer to the section by the single or double digit numbers from1-12.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 435.101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Implementation and compliance procedures for Federal agencies.</ITAG>Alternative methods of achieving compliance are illustrated in Figure 1.1-1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 112</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C </ITAG>1.1 Compliance1.1.1 The head of each Federal agency responsible for the constructionof Federal buildings shall adopt such procedures as may be necessary toassure that the design of the building shall:1.1.1.1 be undertaken in a manner that provides for appropriate considerationof the Principles of Effective Energy Building Design prescribed in andSection;andSection;2.0, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2 and 10.2;1.1.1.2 comply with the minimum requirements of andSection;andSection; 3.3,4.3, 5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3 and 10.3; and1.1.1.3 meet or exceed, based upon the analysis of life-cycle cost-effectivenessrequired by andSection; 1.1.2 below, the following additional requirements:1.1.1.3.1 the lighting design shall meet either the prescriptive requirementsof andSection; 3.4 or the system performance requirements of andSection; 3.5,1.1.1.3.2 the building envelope design shall meet either the prescriptiverequirements of Section 5.4 or the system performance requirements of Section5.5, and1.1.1.3.3 the heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems designshall meet the prescriptive requirements of Section 7.4, and1.1.1.3.4 the service water heating systems design shall meet the prescriptiverequirements of Section 9.4.1.1.2 In lieu of meeting the provisions of Section 1.1.1 above, the buildingdesign shall meet the criteria of the building energy method of Section11.0 or 12.0, Building Energy Compliance Alternatives I and II.1.1.3 The head of each Federal agency responsible for the constructionof Federal buildings shall also assure that the decision-making processfor the design of the building shall employ the methodology for estimatingand comparing the life-cycle cost of Federal buildings and for determininglife-cycle cost-effectiveness prescribed in Subpart A of 10 C.F.R. Part436.1.2 General Approach to Compliance1.2.1 The standards, in addition to minimum requirements, establish threealternate methods to determine whether the design has achieved compliance.1.2.2 There are several alternative methods of achieving compliance providedfor in the standards:1.2.2.1 Prescriptive (Sections 3.4, 5.4, 7.4 and 9.4),1.2.2.2 System Performance (Sections 3.5 and 5.5), or1.2.2.3 Building Energy (Section 11.0 or 12.0).1.2.2.4 The criteria established for each of the methods allow for designsthat are roughly equivalent in terms of energy conservation. The equivalencyof the methods can be demonstrated by designing a building using the Prescriptiveapproach, then modeling the building using either the System Performanceor Building Energy criteria calculation procedures and comparing results.1.2.3 Compliance with these standards shall be demonstrated by meetingthe set of minimum requirements defined in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3,5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3, 7.2, 7.3, 8.2, 8.3, 9.2, 9.3, 10.2, and 10.3 and oneof the alternative methods.1.3 How To Select a Compliance Method1.3.1 Use the Prescriptive method when the minimum amount of calculationand effort to achieve compliance is of primary concern. Its requirementscan be readily specified in construction documents and are easily reviewedby building code enforcement authorities. The Prescriptive method permitsfew trade-offs or optimization procedures, but does permit several energy-effectiveand cost-effective alternate construction options to be used. See Figure1.1-2.1.3.2 Use the System Performance method when more innovative design isrequired, or when the Prescriptive method does not provide the necessarydesign flexibility. It requires more manual calculations than the Prescriptivemethod. See Figure 1.1-21.3.3 Use either of the Building Energy methods (Sections 11.0 or 12.0)when the most innovative design concepts are being considered. The BuildingEnergy methods allow the trade-off of energy among the building systemsas long as the total calculated design annual energy consumption does notexceed the limit prescribed. It will, in general, require the use of acomputer program to simulate the operation of the various systems and tomodel building design energy use in accordance with the building loadsand the proposed schedules of operation. See Figures 11-1 and 12-1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 116</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;435.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Principles of effective energy building design.</ITAG>2.1 General2.1.1 This section complements the other sections of the standards by providinggeneral principles of effective building design. The intention of thissection is to provide ideas on how to improve the integration of the building'smajor energy using subsystems in a cost-effective manner without compromisingthe building's intended functional use or internal environmental conditions.In addition, more narrowly focused principles are included in sections3.0 through 10.0.2.1.2 To comply with the principles of effective design, designers shalluse their professional judgment to identify the building's most significantenergy requirements and select appropriate solutions from the general strategiesfound in this section and the more specific strategies found in sections3.0 through 10.0.2.2 Identification of Significant Energy Requirements2.2.1 Before energy design strategies can be developed for a commercialor multi-family high rise residential building, a clear picture of itsmost significant energy requirements must be developed. The basic approachto achieving an energy conscious design is to improve the energy efficiencyof the building by shifting or reducing loads, improving transport systems,and providing efficient environmental systems and controls. This is accomplishedby first determining which aspects of the building's energy requirementsare the most significant, those that would result in the largest annualenergy costs to the building owner if energy conserving strategies wereotherwise not applied. For example, for a given building, the largest annualenergy cost component may be lighting, followed by cooling, heating, andventilation, respectively. In this example electricity would be the majorenergy source. Therefore, peak time-rates of energy use (i.e., peak powerdemands), as well as direct energy use, would have to be included in anyenergy analysis. Consideration of peak demands will reduce the requirementfor oversizing of energy systems in the building and will also have theadded impact of helping to reduce the need for additional, low utilizationpeak capacity on utility grids.2.2.2 Once the most significant cost components of the building's energyrequirements have been determined, apply the strategies and design solutionslisted below and those that appear in each of the following sections ofthe standards. ln the example noted above, lighting solutions would beaddressed first, followed by cooling, heating, and then ventilation.2.2.3 Research results indicate that the most significant energy uses forany given commercial or multi-family high rise residential building aregenerally not accurately identifiable by professional intuition. Therefore,use shall be made of one of the several available analysis tools, someof which are microcomputer-based.2.3 General Solution Strategies2.3.1 Consider energy efficiency from the initiation of the building designprocess, since design improvements are most easily and effectively madeat that time. Seek the active participation of members of the design teamearly in the design process, including the owner, architect, engineer,and builder, if possible. Consider building attributes such as buildingfunction, form, orientation, window/wall ratio, and HVAC system types earlyin the design process. Each has major energy implications. These considerationsmost likely will result in solutions that minimize both construction andoperation costs, including energy demand charges.2.3.2 Address the building's energy requirements in the following sequence:minimize impact of the building functional requirements; minimize loads;improve the efficiency of distribution and conversion systems; and integratebuilding subsystems into an efficient whole. Each of these is discussedbelow.2.3.2.1 Minimize impact of functional requirements by identifying majorareas that offer energy efficiency opportunities based on the building'sfunctional use, human occupancy requirements, and site characteristics.These areas will vary considerably from building to building dependingupon function and service requirements, and shall be considered when applyingthe criteria of these standards.2.3.2.2 Minimize loads by analyzing the external and internal loads tobe imposed on building energy-using subsystems, both for peak-load andpart-load conditions. Include a determination of how the building relatesto its external environment in the analysis, either adaptively or defensively.Consider changes in building form, aspect ratio, and other attributes thatreduce, redistribute, or delay (shift) loads.2.3.2.3 Improve subsystems by analyzing the diversified energy and demand(power) requirements of each energy-using subsystem serving the functionalrequirements of the building. Consider static and dynamic efficiency ofenergy conversion and energy transport subsystems and include considerationof opportunities to reclaim, redistribute and store energy for later use.2.3.2.4 Alternative ways to integrate systems into the building will beaccomplished by considering both power and time components of energy use.Identify, evaluate, and design each of these components to control theoverall design energy consumption. The following shall be considered whenintegrating major building subsystems:2.3.2.4.1 Address more than one problem when developing design solutions,and make maximum use of building components already present for non-energyreasons (e.g., windows, structural mass);2.3.2.4.2 Examine design solutions that consider time since sufficientenergy may already be present from the environment (e.g., solar heat, nightcooling) or from internal equipment (e.g., lights, computers) but availableat different times than needed. Thus, active (heat pumps with water tanks)and passive (building mass) storage techniques may be considered;2.3.2.4.3 Examine design solutions that consider anticipated space utilization.For example, in large but relatively unoccupied spaces, task or zone heatingmay be considered. Transporting energy (light and heat) from locationsof production and availability to locations of need shall be consideredinstead of the purchase of additional energy;2.3.2.4.4 Never reject waste energy at temperatures usable for space conditioningor other practical purposes, without calculating the economic benefit ofenergy recovery;2.3.2.4.5 Consider design solutions that provide more comfortable surfacetemperatures or increase availability of controlled daylight in buildingsin which human occupancy is a primary function;2.3.2.4.6 Use design solutions that are easily understood as they havea greater probability of use by building occupants; and2.3.2.4.7 Where the functional requirements of the building may change,the installed environmental system should be designed to be adaptable tomeet functional changes that can be anticipated as well as providing flexibilityto meet indeterminate future changes in use, occupancy or other functions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 435.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Lighting.</ITAG>3.1 General3.1.1 This section contains principles of design, a set of minimum requirements,and two alternative compliance procedures, prescriptive and systems performance,for the design of building lighting and lighting control systems, and includesprovisions for daylighting credit. The procedures in this section are solelyfor use in establishing lighting design budgets and are not intended foruse as lighting design procedures.3.1.2 <T3>Scope</T3>. The following are covered by this section:3.1.2.1 Interior spaces of buildings;3.1.2.2 Building exteriors and exterior areas, such as entrances, exits,and loading docks; and3.1.2.3 Roads, grounds, parking, and other exterior areas where lightingis energized through the building electrical service.3.1.3 <T3>Exemptions</T3>. The following are exempt from these standards:3.1.3.1 Outdoor manufacturing, commercial greenhouses, and processing facilities;3.1.3.2 Lighting power for theatrical production studios and stages, televisionbroadcasting studios, audio-visual presentation, and entertainment facilitiesin spaces such as stages, hotel ballrooms, nightclubs, discos, and casinos,and where lighting is an essential technical element for the function performed;3.1.3.3 Specialized luminaires for medical and dental purposes;3.1.3.4 Outdoor athletic facilities;3.1.3.5 Lighting power for display lighting required for art exhibits ordisplays in galleries, museums and monuments;3.1.3.6 Exterior lighting for public monuments;3.1.3.7 Special lighting needs for research;3.1.3.8 Lighting power for lighting used solely for indoor plant growthduring the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.;3.1.3.9 Emergency lighting that is automatically ``off'' during normaloperation;3.1.3.10 High risk security areas or any area identified by local ordinancesor regulations or by security or safety personnel as requiring additionallighting;3.1.3.11 Lighting power densities for spaces with enhanced lighting specificallydesigned for primary use by the visually impaired, hard of hearing, orfor senior citizens;3.1.3.12 Lighting for signs;3.1.3.13 Store-front exterior-enclosed display windows in retail facilities;and3.1.3.14 Lighting for dwelling units.3.1.4 <T3>Building Lighting Power Allowance</T3>. The lighting power allowancefor a building consists of the Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA),in accordance with Section 3.3, plus the Interior Lighting Power Allowance(ILPA) in accordance with Section 3.4 or 3.5. This lighting power allowanceis the upper limit to which the building can be designed, based on thecriteria of the compliance alternative chosen.3.1.4.1 The prescriptive criteria in Section 3.4 provides a single complianceprocedure based on calculating a lighting budget by building type or majorarea type within which a designer can flexibly design a lighting solution.To obtain credit for specific lighting energy conservation measures, useSection 3.5, Section 11.0, or Section 12.0.3.1.4.2 The systems performance criteria in Section 3.5 provides a morecomplex compliance procedure based on calculating a lighting budget byactivity or spaces within which the designer can flexibly design a lightingsolution and receive credit for energy conserving controls and daylightingmeasures. To receive credit for more complex lighting conservation measuresuse Section 11.0 or 12.0.3.1.5 <T3>Credit for Daylighting</T3>. Daylighting credit, for reduced use ofelectric lighting energy resulting from the use of automatic lighting controldevices in conjunction with fenestration (e.g., windows and skylights),may be taken if the systems performance alternative in Section 3.5 is chosen.However, if such daylighting credit is to be applied to other buildingsubsystems, such as use of additional fenestration area, Section 11.0 or12.0 must be used. Thermal credit provisions for daylighting are foundin Section 5.0. 3.1.6 <T3>Compliance</T3>. A building shall be considered in compliance withthis Section if the following conditions are met: 3.1.6.1 The minimum requirements of Section 3.3 are met;3.1.6.2 The exterior lighting power to be installed is not greater thanthe Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA), calculated using Equation3.3-1;3.1.6.3 The interior lighting power to be installed is not greater thanthe Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), based on either the PrescriptiveCriteria in Section 3.4 or the Systems Performance Criteria in Section3.5.3.1.6.4 Tradeoffs between ILPA and ELPA are not allowed. Tradeoffs of theinterior Lighting Power Budgets (LPB) among interior spaces are allowedas long as the total Connected Lighting Power (CLP) within the buildingdoes not exceed the Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) and LightingPower Control Credits (LPCC) are used only for connected lighting powerin those spaces for which credit is claimed. Tradeoffs of exterior lightingpower budgets among exterior areas are allowed as long as the total ConnectedLighting Power (CLP) of exterior lighting does not exceed the ExteriorLighting Power Allowance (ELPA) and the allowance for the building exteriorsurfaces is not exceeded.3.1.7 <T3>Multi-Building Facilities</T3>. The total lighting power allowancesfor each building in a multi-building facility shall be calculated separately.3.2 Principles of Design3.2.1 The lighting system is designed to provide a productive, safe, andpleasing visual environment for the intended use of the space. However,lighting is both a major energy end use in commercial buildings (especiallyin office buildings) and a major contributor to internal loads by increasingcooling loads and decreasing heating loads. Therefore, it is importantto produce a design that meets the lighting functional criteria of thespace as well as one that minimizes energy use. Recommended maintainedilluminance levels for visual tasks and surrounding lighted areas are includedin the <T3>IES Lighting Handbook, Applications (1983) or Reference (1985)</T3>.Principles of energy conserving design within that context are describedbelow.3.2.2 The following Design Concepts shall be considered in the design oflighting that is both energy efficient and visually effective.3.2.2.1 Energy use is determined by the lighting load (demand power) andits duration of use (time). Minimize the actual demand load rather thanjust the apparent connected load, and control the load rather than justswitching, if switching may adversely affect the quality of the luminousenvironment.3.2.2.2 Consider daylighting along with the proper use of controls so thatthe savings from electric lighting can be realized. Design should be sensitiveto window glare, sudden changes in luminances, and general use acceptanceof controls. Window treatment (blinds, drapes and shades) and glazing shouldbe carefully selected to control direct solar penetration and luminanceextremes while still maintaining view and daylight penetration.3.2.2.3 Design lighting systems so that illumination required for tasksis primarily limited to the location of the task and from a direction thatwill minimize direct glare and veiling reflections on the task. For example,the ideal positioning of work stations is between the rows of ceiling-mountedluminaires with the direction of view parallel to the primary task. Indensely-occupied work spaces, uniform distribution of general lightingmay be most appropriate. Where supplementary task illumination is necessary,general or ambient illumination should not be lower than a third of theluminance required for the task. This will help maintain luminance ratesthat are visually comfortable.3.2.2.4 Use task lighting, whenever possible, to accommodate the need forhigher lighting levels due to task visual difficulty, glare, intermittentlychanging requirements, or individual visual differences (poor and agingeyesight).3.2.2.5 Group similar activities so high illuminance or special lightingfor particular tasks are localized in certain rooms or areas, and so thatless efficient fixtures required for critical glare control do not haveto be installed uniformly when they are only required sparsely.3.2.2.6 When indirect lighting is appropriate, use schemes that createreasonably uniform ceiling luminances. If this is achieved, work spacesmay be located anywhere and occupants may face in any direction withoutbeing subject to excessive veiling reflection on the tasks. The indirectsystem may allow more effective use of the space than other types of lightingsystems. However, indirect lighting systems generally have lower utilizationfactors, and may require increased ceiling height to provide uniform ceilingluminance.3.2.2.7 Use lighting controls throughout that maintain proper lightinglevels when and where it is needed but also allow reductions in lightingwhen tasks are less critical, or spaces are not fully occupied. The designermust consider user acceptance of control strategies to maximize energyefficiency.3.2.2.8 Use lower levels of ambient lighting in situations such as merchandising,where the contrast between accent lighting and ambient lighting is critical.Accent lighting shall not exceed five (5) times the ambient level. Considerfewer, more effectively-accented displays, rather than more ineffectively-accentedones.3.2.3 The following guidelines identify Fixture and Lamp selection strategiesto be considered in the selection of luminaires and lamps for inclusionin an energy efficient, visually-effective design:3.2.3.1 Consider the use of more efficient equipment with appropriate distribution,glare control and visual characteristics. Utilize fixture designs thatwill provide high lighting efficiency while meeting the other lightingobjectives of the installation.3.2.3.2 Review visual comfort probability (VCP) data, available from manufacturers,for specific luminaires when minimizing discomfort glare is a criterion.3.2.3.3 Consider luminaire construction that minimizes light loss due todirt collection.3.2.3.4 Investigate the use of dimmers to reduce energy consumption whenthe system is new and capable of providing more light than the averagedepreciated design value.3.2.3.5 Use more efficient lamps with appropriate luminous efficacy, lifeexpectancy and spectrum distribution and color rendering characteristics.3.2.3.6 Use more efficient ballasts for fluorescent and HID lamps withappropriate ballast factors, power factor, noise rating, starting and restartingcharacteristics.3.2.3.7 Use luminaires with heat removal and heat recovery capabilities,thereby allowing the lighting equipment to operate more efficiently ata lower ambient temperature. 3.2.3.8 Limit the use of lower efficiency lamps, such as incandescent,to only those applications where their color, lumens or distribution characteristicscannot be duplicated by other sources. Due to their lower efficiency, theuse of ``extended service'' incandescent lamps should be limited to thoseapplications where fixtures are difficult to reach and/or maintenance costsfor revamping will be excessive.3.2.4 Space Design3.2.4.1 It is important to carry through on the lighting design when completingthe interior design. Reduce light absorption by encouraging the use oflighter finishes, particularly on ceilings, walls and partitions. Selectcolors and surface materials so that their reflectance values are withinthe ranges recommended by the IES. This will aid the efficient use of lightand help to provide comfortable luminance ratios. 3.2.4.2 In offices with visual display terminals (VDT) that are susceptibleto reflections, it may be necessary to use reflectances for some room surfacesat the low end of the recommended ranges to reduce unwanted reflectionson the screens. Where practical, treat the screens of VDTs with anti-glarematerials to avoid veiling reflection.3.3 Minimum Requirements3.3.1 Lighting Controls.3.3.1.1 All lighting shall be provided with manual, automatic, or programmablecontrols.3.3.1.1.1 <T3>Exception to Section 3.3.1.1:</T3>(a) controls for emergency or exit lighting.3.3.1.2 <T3>Minimum Number of Lighting Controls</T3>.

It sets principles of good envelope design, andprovides a set of minimum requirements and two alternative compliance paths_prescriptiveand system performance.5.1.2 <T3>Compliance</T3>. A building shall be considered in Compliance withthis section if the following conditions are met:5.1.2.1 The minimum requirements of Section 5.3 are met;5.1.2.2 The design of the building envelope complies with either the prescriptivecriteria of Section 5.4 or the system performance criteria of Section 5.5.For the design of buildings with high internal heat gains, unusual operatingschedules, or that incorporate innovative design strategies, considerationshall be given to using the compliance paths set forth in Sections 11.0or 12.0.5.1.3 The prescriptive compliance alternative of Section 5.4 provides requirementsfor buildings designed to take advantage of perimeter daylighting, thermalmass, high performance glazings, and fenestration shading. The designeris allowed to make trade-offs between thermal mass, wall insulation, amountof fenestration, shading coefficients, shading projections, thermal transmittanceof the glazing, daylighting for several different climate locations.5.1.4 The systems performance compliance alternative of Section 3.5 providescalculation procedures that give credit for the benefits of more complexenergy conserving envelope designs.5.1.5 Information on thermal properties, performance of building envelopesections and components, and heat transfer shall be obtained from the <T3>ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume</T3>. When information isnot available from this source, the data shall be obtained from laboratoryor field test measurements conducted in accordance with <T3>ASTM Standard C-177-85</T3>, ``Standard Test Method for Steady-StateThermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded Hot Plate,'' <T3>ASTM Standard C-518-85</T3>, ``Steady-State Thermal Transmission Propertiesby Means of the Heat Flow Meter,'' <T3>ASTM Standard C-236-80</T3>, ``Standard Test Method for Steady-StateThermal Performance of Building Assemblies by Means of a Guarded Hot Box,''and <T3>ASTM Standard C-976-82</T3>, ``Thermal Performance of Building AssembliesBy Means of a Calibrated Hot Box.'' 5.1.6 <T3>Daylighting Credit</T3>. In this section, daylighting credit for reducedenergy use resulting from the use of automatic lighting control devicesin conjunction with fenestration, is given only for space heating and coolingloads. Credit for the reduced use of electric lighting energy is calculatedin Section 3.5.6. If daylighting credit for reduced electric lighting energyuse is desired to be applied to other building systems, such as more fenestrationarea, Section 11.0 or 12.0 should be used.5.1.7 The requirements of this section are not intended to replace buildingloads calculation procedures.5.2 Principles of Design<ITAG tagnum="81">5.2.1 Building Loads</ITAG>5.2.1.1 Building loads result from sources external and internal to thebuilding. (1) External loads, from outdoor temperature, humidity, wind,and insolation, fluctuate daily and seasonally. (2) Internal loads fromthe activities conducted within the building, including heating and moistureproduced by the occupants, lights, and process equipment (e.g., appliances,computers) vary with internal activities. Improving energy efficiency ina building depends on achieving a balance between and among the internaland external loads. The building design should, therefore, offset gainsand losses of heat, light, and moisture between the interior and exteriorof the building, among interior spaces, and over-time, (daily, seasonally,and annually). 5.2.1.2 This balance of loads can be most efficiently achieved if the buildingenvelope is viewed as, and designed to be, a controlled membrane ratherthan an immutable barrier. The typical design of a modern building hasconsidered the building envelope to be a fixed barrier that restricts heatand air flow to the maximum extent possible. This will not usually yieldthe most energy efficient building. 5.2.1.3 The desired goal of the energy design of the building envelopeshall be to produce a controlled membrane that allows or prevents heat,light, and moisture flow to achieve a balance between internal and externalloads. Thus the envelope becomes an integral part of the building's environmentalconditioning systems.5.2.1.4 To achieve control of the building envelope as a membrane, andto simultaneously achieve occupant comfort in the perimeter zones, manyof the traditional building skin components must be used (insulation, mass,caulking and weather stripping). However, other concepts shall also beconsidered to temper supply air or utilize waste heat in exhaust air totemper envelope conditions, such as operable solar shading devices, andthe integration of glazing systems with the HVAC distribution system.<ITAG tagnum="81">5.2.1.5 Control of External Loads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">5.2.1.5.1 Control of Conduction </ITAG>(a) Controlled conductivity may be considered through the careful use ofinsulation, sensible (mass) or phase-change storage and movable insulationat levels which minimizes net heating and cooling loads on a time integrated(annual) basis. (b) Unintentional or uncontrolled thermal bridges shall be minimized andconsidered in energy related calculations since they can radically alterthe conductivity of a building envelope. Examples include wall studs, balconies,ledges, and extensions of building slabs. <ITAG tagnum="81">5.2.1.5.2 Control of Infiltration (Heat Loss or Gain) </ITAG>(a) Infiltration shall be minimized and all efforts to achieve a zero levelshall be taken. This will minimize fan energy consumption in pressurizedbuildings during occupied periods and heat loss (or unwanted heat gainin warm climates) during unoccupied periods. Infiltration reduction shallbe accomplished through design details that enhance the fit and integrityof building envelope joints in a way that may be readily achieved duringbuilding construction. This includes infiltration control by caulking,weather stripping, vestibule doors and/or revolving doors with constructionmeeting or exceeding accepted specifications.(b) The quantity of mechanical ventilation must vary with the need, withrecommended values at any given time equal to that required by ASHRAE Standard62-1981. Higher levels of ventilation (e.g., economizers) shall be consideredto substitute for mechanical cooling. (c) Operable windows may be considered to allow for occupant controlledventilation. When using operable windows, the design of the building'smechanical system must be carefully executed to minimize unnecessary HVACenergy consumption, and building operators must be cautioned about theimproper use of the operable windows. (d) Non-mechanical ventilation can be enhanced in the shape of the buildingas well as the physical elements of the building envelope, such as cupolas.(e) For hotels and high rise dwelling units and other systems having exhausttotalling 3000 cfm or more, with annual operation in excess of 3000 hoursand within 200 linear ft of simultaneous make-up air equipment, they shallincorporate energy recovery or treatment to ASHRAE 62-1981 quality levelsand reuse exhaust air when allowed by code.<ITAG tagnum="81">5.2.1.5.3 Control of Radiated Heat Losses and Gains </ITAG>(a) Capability for occupant radiant comfort shall be maintained regardlessof whether the building envelope is designed to be a static or dynamicmembrane. Opaque surfaces shall be designed so that the <T3>average </T3>inside surface temperatures will remain within 5 anddegrees;Fof room temperature in the coldest anticipated weather (i.e., winter designconditions), and the coldest inside surface will remain within 25 anddegrees;Fof the room temperature. (b) In a building with time-varying internal heat generation, thermal massmay be considered for controlling radiant comfort. In the perimeter zone,thermal mass is more effective when it is positioned internal to the envelopeinsulation. (c) The effective control of solar radiation is critical to the designof energy-efficient buildings due to the high level of internal heat productionalready present in most commercial building types. In some climates, thelighting energy consumption savings due to daylighting techniques can begreater than the heating and cooling energy penalties from additional glazedsurface area, provided that the building envelope is properly designedfor daylighting and lighting controls are installed and used. In otherclimates they may not. Daylighting designs are most effective if directsolar beam radiation is not allowed to cause glare in building spaces.(d) The transparent portions of the building envelope shall be designedto prevent solar radiant gain above that necessary for effective daylightingand solar heating. On south-facing facades, the use of low shading coefficientsis generally not as effective as external physical shading devices in achievingthis balance. Light shelves offer a very effective means of admitting daylightwhile shading the view glazing and simultaneously allowing occupants tomanipulate interior shading devices (draperies, blinds) without eliminatingday light. (e) The solar spectrum contains a range of wavelengths including visibleand infrared (heat). Designers shall consider which portion of the spectrumto admit into the building. For example, low emissivity, high-visible-transmittanceglazings may be considered for the effective control of radiant heat gainsand losses. For shading control designers may consider the careful useof vegetation that can block excess gain, year-around or seasonally dependingon the plant species chosen. 5.3 Minimum Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">5.3.1 Overall Thermal Transmittance (U</ITAG><T2>o</T2>)5.3.1.1 The overall thermal transmittance of the building envelope abovegrade assembly shall be calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s100 </C> <H1>U</H1><T2>o</T2>=SU<T2>i</T2>A<T2>i</T2>/A<T2>o</T2>=(U<T2>1</T2>A<T2>1</T2>+U<T2>2</T2>A<T2>2</T2>+ . . . +U<T2>n</T2>A<T2>n</T2>)/A<T2>o</T2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Equation 5.3-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U<T2>o</T2>=the area weighted average thermal transmittance of the grossarea of the building envelope assembly, e.g., the exterior wall assemblyincluding fenestration and doors; roofs and ceiling assembly; or the floorassembly, Btu/handCx.1;ft \2\andCx.1;anddegrees;F.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A<T2>o</T2>=the gross area of the envelope assembly, ft \2\.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U<T2>i</T2>=the thermal transmittance of each individual path of the envelopeassembly (see Section 5.3.2), U<T2>i</T2>=1/R<T2>i</T2> (where R<T2>1</T2> is the total resistance to heat flow of an individual path throughan envelope assembly). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A<T2>i</T2>=the area of each individual element of the envelope assembly,ft \2\.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">5. 3. 2 </ITAG><T3>Thermal Resistance of Below Grade Components (R)</T3>5.3.2.1 In calculating the thermal resistance of all below grade components,the thermal performance of the adjacent ground shall be excluded.<ITAG tagnum="81">5.3.2.2 </ITAG><T3>Slabs</T3>5.3.2.2.1 The R-value required for slabs refers only to the insulationmaterials.

ThisACP is not available for those climates that do not usually require spacecooling by means of mechanical refrigeration.(a) This daylighting credit is in addition to the increased lighting powerallowance provided in Section 3.5. Some perimeter daylighting options allowa greater proportion of fenestration area due to the increased visibleand decreased thermal transmittances of high performance glazings in combinationwith automatic lighting controls.5.4.1.3 Each ACP provides a limited number of complying combinations ofbuilding variables for a set of climate ranges. The criteria, such as maximumpercent fenestration, were calculated using the system performance criteriaof Section 5.5. Values were chosen from within climate and other variableranges for the most restrictive results, to ensure compliance of any combinationof values within those ranges. Thus, for most climate locations and envelopeparameters, the prescriptive criteria may be slightly more stringent thanthe system performance criteria of Section 5.5.5.4.1.4 Both the base and perimeter daylight cases have two or three fenestrationU-value ranges depending on the climate.5.4.2 Compliance.5.4.2.1 The envelope design of the building being evaluated is in compliancewith the prescriptive criteria of this section provided that:5.4.2.1.1 The minimum requirements of Section 5.3 are met.5.4.2.1.2 All envelope thermal transmittance (U) values are less than orequal to those chosen from the ACP Table selected for roofs, opaque walls,walls next to unconditioned spaces, and floors over unconditioned spaces.5.4.2.1.3 The percentage of fenestration of the combined gross wall areais less than or equal to the value permitted for internal load range andglazing in the selected ACP Table.5.4.2.1.4 Slab-on-grade floors have insulation around the perimeter ofthe floor with the thermal resistance (R<T2>u</T2>) of the insulation as listed in the ACP table. The slab insulationspecified shall extend either in a vertical plane downward from the topof the slab for the minimum distance shown or downward to the bottom ofthe slab then in a horizontal plane beneath the slab or outward from thebuilding for the minimum distance shown. The horizontal length, or verticaldepth, of insulation required varies from 24 in. to 48 in. depending uponthe R-value selected. For heated slabs, an R of 2 shall be added to thethermal resistance required.(a) Vertical insulation shall not be required to extend below the foundationfooting.(b) There are no insulation requirements for slabs in locations havingless than 3,000 HDD65 or for footings extending less than 18 in. belowgrade.5.4.2.1.5 The thermal resistance of the below-grade wall assembly mustbe greater than or equal to that listed in the ACP table, or the heat losscalculated in accordance with Chapter 25 of the <T3>ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals</T3> shall be less than or equalto that of a wall below grade having a thermal resistance equal to thatspecified in Figure 5.5-3. No insulation is required for climates withless than 3,000 HDD65 or for those portions of walls more than one storybelow grade.5.4.3 Procedure for Using the Alternate Component Packages (ACP).5.4.3.1 The prescriptive envelope criteria for each of 30 climate rangesare contained in Tables 5.4-2 through 5.4-31. 5.4.3.2 The following steps shall be used to determine compliance withthese prescriptive envelope criteria.5.4.3.2.1 Determine appropriate climate range using either (a) or (b) below.(a) From Table 5.4-1, select the appropriate ACP Table based on the climatefor the building site. The main climate variables that are needed for theproper selection of an ACP Table are cooling degree-days base 65 anddegrees;F(CDD65), heating degree-days base 50 anddegrees;F (HDD50), and annual averagedaily incident of solar radiation on the east or west vertical surfaceof the facade, Btu/ft\2\/day (VSEW). For certain climate ranges this mustbe augmented by cooling degree-hours base 80 anddegrees;F (CDH80).

If the site is not one of the cities listed or ifthe climate at the site differs significantly from a listed adjacent city,obtain the information from the weather bureau or other reliable sourceand use (a) above. The column designated ``ACP Table No.'' contains thetable number of the appropriate ACP Table.(c) For information purposes only, the climate data used to develop theACP tables for the above-grade wall section are shown in Table 5.4-32.The criteria for all other envelope sections was based on the most stringentlevel for the cities listed in the ACP Table.5.4.3.2.2 Determination of Maximum Allowable Percent Fenestration.(a) Using the appropriate ACP Table, determine the maximum allowable percentfenestration. The maximum allowable percent fenestration is the total areaof fenestration assemblies divided by the total gross exterior wall area,considering all elevations of the building. Determining the maximum allowablepercent fenestration requires the following five steps:(1) Based on the Internal Load Density (ILD) for the proposed design, selectone of the three Internal Load Ranges as the point of entry to the tables.Note for ILD's greater than 3.5 W/ft \2\ use the 3.5 W/ft \2\ range. Forshell buildings, see procedures in Section 5.3.8. Determine the ILD ofthe proposed design, based on the sum of the Internal Lighting Power Allowance(ILPA), the Equipment Power Density (EPD) and Occupant Load Adjustment(OLA), as shown in Equation 5.4-1.<ITAG tagnum="26">ILD=ILPA+EPD+OLA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Equation 5.4-1</ITAG>Where:The Internal Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) shall be:1. The building average Internal Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) of thedesign building in W/ft \2\ as determined in Section 3.4 or 3.5;2. The average of the Lighting Power Budgets (LPB) for all activity areaswithin 15 ft of each exterior wall based on the procedures specified bythe Systems Performance Criteria of Section 3.5.3, or3.

The building average receptacle power density selected from Table 5.4-33in W/ft \2\; or<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 235 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/>2. The actual average receptacle power density for all activity areas within15 ft of each exterior wall in W/ft \2\, considering diversity. For determiningcompliance in Tables 5.4-2 through 5.4-31, the actual average receptaclepower densities calculated by this method that exceed 1.0 W/ft \2\ shallbe limited to 1.0 W/ft \2\ in Equation  5.4-1.The Occupant Load Adjustment (OLA) shall be either:1. 0.0 W/ft\2\. This recognizes the assumed occupant sensible load of 0.6W/ft\2\ that is built into the ACP tables; or2. A positive or negative difference between the actual occupant load and0.6 W/ft\2\ if the design building has a larger or smaller occupant load.(2) <T3>Select external shading projection factor (PF)</T3>. If no externalshading projections are used in the proposed design, select the columndesignated Projection Factor=0.000^0.249. If external shading projectionsare used, determine the average area weighted projection factor on thewindow in accordance with Equation 5.4-2. Then select the appropriate columnin the ACP Table.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,10 </C> <H1>PF=P</H1><T2>d</T2>/H<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Equation 5.4-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PF=Average area weighted projection factor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P<T2>d</T2>=External horizontal shading projection depth, in. or ft</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H=Sum of height of the fenestration and the distance from the topof the fenestration to the bottom of external shading projection in unitsconsistent with P<T2>d</T2>.</ITAG>(3) Select the Shading Coefficient of the fenestration (SC<T2>x</T2>) including internal, integral, and external shading devices,but excluding the effect of external shading projections (PF). This includescurtains, shades, or blinds. Reference <T3>ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume</T3>, Chapter 27.(4) Select one of the daylighting options, either:1. Base Case, no daylighting; or2. Perimeter Daylighting (automatic daylight controls for lighting systemmust be used). This option is not available in some locations.(5) Select appropriate fenestration type. For most options, this is determinedby the thermal transmittance value (U<T2>of</T2>) of the fenestration assembly. For some fenestration options,the visible light transmittance (VLT) of the fenestration should not beless than the shading coefficient of the glazed portion of the fenestrationassembly, not considering any shading devices. The ranges generally correspondto single glazing, double glazing, triple glazing and high performanceglazing incorporating low emissivity coatings/films or more than two glazinglayers. Each ACP table includes at most, three ranges of glazing U-value.5.4.4.2.3 <T3>Determine the Maximum U</T3><T2>ow</T2> <T3>for the Opaque Wall Assembly</T3>. In the appropriate ACP Table theMaximum U<T2>ow</T2> for the opaque wall assembly is determined using the followingsteps:(a) For a lightweight wall assembly, heat capacity (HC) less than 5 Btu/ft\2\andCx.1;anddegrees;F,use the value indicated. This U<T2>ow</T2> is constant over all internal load ranges.(b) To use the mass wall adjustment, the following additional steps arenecessary:(1) Select the same internal load range as that used in determining themaximum allowable percent fenestration.(2) Select the mass wall heat capacity (HC) and insulation position. Ifthe wall insulation is positioned internal to or integral with the wallmass, use the column headed Interior/Integral Insulation. If the wall insulationis positioned external to the wall mass use the column headed ExteriorInsulation. For HC less than 5 Btu/ft\2\andCx.1;anddegrees;F this adjustmenttable cannot be used. At this step you will have two choices of U<T2>ow</T2> that are keyed to a small or large percent fenestration. Thisrepresents the full range of U<T2>ow</T2> values allowed.(3) Select or interpolate the appropriate maximum U<T2>ow</T2> for the opaque wall based on the maximum allowable percentfenestration determined in Section 5.4.4.2.2 or the actual building percentfenestration whichever value is lower. The U<T2>ow</T2> shall be determined by straight line interpolation for fenestrationpercentages between the smallest and largest values listed. If the designbuilding percentage fenestration is less than the smallest value listed,select the U<T2>ow</T2> for the largest percentage fenestration listed.5.4.4.2.4 <T3>Determine Other Envelope Criteria</T3>.

The use of distribution system transformers shall be minimized.6.2.1.3 Tenant submetering can be one of the most cost-effective energyconservation measures available. A large portion of the energy use in tenantfacilities occurs simply because there is no economic incentive to conserve.6.3 Minimum Requirements6.3.1 Electrical Distribution System6.3.1.1 All commercial or multi-family high rise residential buildings,having designed connected electric service over 250 kVA, shall have electricalenergy consumption check metered on the basis of usage category or tenantoccupancy, depending on conditions defined below. For buildings that areoccupied by multiple tenants, the metering shall be per tenant, if thetenant has a connected load of 100 kVA or more. HVAC and service hot watersystems, shared among tenants, need not meet this requirement but shallbe separately metered.6.3.1.2 The electrical power feeders for each facility for which check-meteringis required shall be by tenant and shall be subdivided in accordance withthe following categories:6.3.1.2.1 Lighting and receptacle outlets;6.3.1.2.2 HVAC and service water heating systems and equipment; and6.3.1.2.3 Special occupant equipment or systems of more than 20 kW, suchas elevators, computer rooms, kitchens, printing equipment, and balingpresses.6.3.1.2.4 <T3>Exception to Section 6.3.1.2:</T3>(a) 10% or less of the loads on a feeder may be from another usage category.6.3.1.3 The power feeders for each category shall contain portable or permanentsubmetering prior to or within any primary or secondary distribution panels.Such provisions shall include a separate compartment or panel of adequatesize and design to house the necessary voltage and current transformers.An accessible means of attaching clamp-on meters or split-core currenttransformers shall be provided.6.3.1.4 The locations of these points of measurement may be central ordistributed throughout the building, as appropriate to the layout of thebuilding. A minimum arrangement shall provide a safe method for accessto the enclosures through which feeder conductors pass, and have sufficientspace to attach clamp-on or split-core current transformers. These enclosuresmay be separate compartments or combined with electrical cabinets servinganother function. Enclosures so furnished shall be identified by availablemeasuring function. A preferred arrangement would include kWh meters anddemand registers, or a means to transmit such information to a buildingenergy management control system.6.3.1.5 In multiple-tenant buildings, where designed connected electricalservice is over 250 kVA, each tenant space having a total connected loadof more than 100 kVA shall have provision made to permit check-meteringof the total tenant load. If the building is served by a common HVAC system,the HVAC loads need not be check metered for each tenant.6.3.2 Transformers6.3.2.1 All permanently wired transformers, that are part of the buildingelectrical distribution system, except utility-owned transformers, shallbe selected to minimize the combination of no-load, part-load, and full-loadlosses, without compromising the electrical system operating and reliabilityrequirements.6.3.2.2 If the total capacity of the transformers exceeds 300 kVA, a calculationof total estimated annual operating costs of the transformer losses shallbe made.

It is recommended that the designer evaluate otherenergy conservation measures that may be applicable to the proposed design.7.1.2 A building shall be considered in compliance with this section ifthe following conditions are met:7.1.2.1 The minimum requirements of Section 7.3 are met; and7.1.2.2 The HVAC system design complies with the prescriptive criteriaof section 7.4. For the design of HVAC systems that incorporate innovativeor alternate design strategies, the compliance paths set forth in Section11.0 or 12.0 should be used.7.2 Principles of Design7.2.1 Control of Equipment Loads7.2.1.1 The thermal impact of equipment and appliances shall be minimizedby use of hoods, radiation shields, or other confining techniques, andby use of controls to assure that such equipment is turned off when notneeded. In addition, major heat-generating equipment shall, where practical,be located where it can balance other heat losses. For example, computercenters or kitchen areas could be located in the north or northwest perimeterareas of buildings depending on climate and prevailing wind directions.In addition, heat recovery shall be specifically considered for this equipment.7.2.2 HVAC System Design7.2.2.1 Separate HVAC systems shall be considered to serve areas expectedto operate on widely differing operating schedules or design conditions.For instance, systems serving office areas should generally be separatefrom those serving retail areas. When a single system serves a multi-tenantbuilding, provisions shall be made to shut-off or set-back the heatingand cooling to each area independently.7.2.2.2 Spaces with relatively constant and weather-independent loads maybe served with systems separate from those serving perimeter spaces. Areaswith special temperature or humidity requirements, such as computer rooms,shall be served by systems separate from those serving areas that requirecomfort heating and cooling only, alternatively, these areas shall be servedby supplementary or auxiliary systems.7.2.2.3 The supply of zone cooling and heating shall be sequenced to preventthe simultaneous operation of heating and cooling systems for same space.Where this is not possible due to ventilation or air circulation requirements,air quantities shall be reduced as much as possible before reheating, recooling,or mixing hot and cold air streams. Finally, supply air temperature shallbe reset to extend economizer operations and to reduce reheat, recool,or mixing losses.7.2.2.4 Systems serving areas with significant internal heat gains (lighting,equipment, and people), especially interior zones with little or no exposureto outside air, shall be designed to take advantage of mild or cool weatherconditions to reduce cooling energy if heat recovery systems are not used.These systems, called air or water economizers, shall be designed to providea partial reduction in cooling loads even when mechanical cooling mustbe used to provide the remainder of the load. Economizer controls shallbe integrated with the mechanical cooling (leaving air temperature) controlsso that mechanical cooling is only operated when necessary and so supplyair is not overcooled to a temperature below the desired supply temperature.The systems and controls shall be designed so that economizer operationdoes not increase heating energy use. For instance, single fan dual ductor multizone systems that use the same mixed air plenum for both heatingand cooling supplies shall not be used.7.2.2.5 Controls shall be provided to allow systems to operate in an occupiedmode and an unoccupied mode. In the occupied mode, controls shall providefor a gradually changing control point as system demands change from coolingto heating. In the unoccupied mode, ventilation and exhaust systems shallbe shut off if possible, and comfort heating and cooling systems shallbe shut off except to maintain ``setback'' space conditions. The setbackconditions shall be the minimum and maximum levels required to preventdamage to the building or its contents and provide for a reasonable morningpick-up period. Note however that night setback may not conserve energyin buildings with large amounts of thermal mass.7.2.2.6 In areas where diurnal temperature swings and humidity levels permit,the judicious coupling of air distribution systems and building structuralmass may be considered to allow the use of night-time precooling to reducethe use of day-time mechanical cooling.7.2.2.7 High ventilation, such as in hospital operating rooms, can imposeenormous heating and cooling loads on HVAC equipment. In these cases, considerationshall be given to the use of recirculating filtered and cleaned air, ratherthan 100% outside air, and pre-heating outside air with solar systems orreclaimed heat from other sources.7.2.3 Energy Transport Systems7.2.3.1 Energy shall be transported by the most energy efficient meanspossible. The following options, are listed in order of efficiency fromthe (most efficient) lowest energy transport burden to the highest:7.2.3.1.1 Electric Wire or Fuel Pipe,7.2.3.1.2 Two-Phase Fluid Transfer (Steam or Refrigerant),7.2.3.1.3 Single-Phase Liquid Fluid (Water, Glycol, Etc.), and7.2.3.1.4 Air.7.2.3.2 The distribution system shall be selected to complement other systemparameters such as control strategies, storage capabilities, and conversionand utilization system efficiencies.7.2.3.3 Steam Systems7.2.3.3.1 Provisions for seasonal or ``non-use time'' shutdown shall beincorporated.7.2.3.3.2 The venting of steam and ingestion of air shall be minimizedwith the design directed toward full vapor performance.7.2.3.3.3 Subcooling shall generally be prevented.7.2.3.3.4 Condensate shall be returned to boilers or source devices atthe highest possible temperature.7.2.3.4 Water Systems7.2.3.4.1 Design flow quantity shall be minimized by designing for themaximum practical temperature differential.7.2.3.4.2 Flow quantity shall be varied with load where possible.7.2.3.4.3 Designs shall be for lowest practical pressure rise (or drop).7.2.3.4.4 Operating and idle control modes shall be provided.7.2.3.4.5 When locating equipment, the critical pressure path shall beidentified and the runs sized for minimum practical pressure drop.7.2.3.5 Air Systems7.2.3.5.1 Air flow quantity shall be minimized by careful load analysisand an effective distribution system. If the psychometric nature of theapplication allows, the supply air quantity shall vary with the sensibleload (i.e., VAV systems). The fan pressure requirement shall be held tothe lowest practical value. Fan pressure shall be avoided as a source forcontrol power.7.2.3.5.2 Each fan system shall be designed and controlled to reduce mechanicalcooling requirements by taking advantage of favorable weather conditions.7.2.3.5.3 ``Normal'' and ``idle'' control modes shall be provided for thefan systems as well as the psychometric systems.7.2.3.5.4 Duct run distances shall be as short as possible, and the runson the critical pressure path sized for minimum practical pressure drop.7.2.4 Radiant Heating7.2.4.1 Radiant heating systems shall be considered in lieu of convectiveor all-air heating systems to heat areas which experience infiltrationloads in excess of two (2) air changes per hour at design heating conditions.7.2.4.2 Radiant heating systems should be considered for areas with highceilings, for spot heating, and for other applications where radiant heatingmay be more energy efficient than convective or all-air heating systems.7.2.5 Energy Recovery7.2.5.1 Systems that recover energy should be considered when rejectedfluid is of adequate temperature and a simultaneous need for energy existsfor a significant number of operating hours.7.3 Minimum Requirements7.3.1 Calculation Procedures7.3.1.1 Heating and cooling system design loads for the purpose of sizingsystems and equipment shall be determined in accordance with the proceduresdescribed in the <T3>ASHRAE Handbook, 1985 Fundamentals Volume, </T3>or a similar computationprocedure.

Energy cost is used as the common denominatorin determining compliance. Using unit costs rather than units of energyor power such as Btu, kWh or kW allows the energy use contribution of differentfuel sources at different times to be added and compared. This path allowsfor innovation in designs, materials, and equipment, such as daylighting,passive solar heating, heat recovery, better zonal temperature control,thermal storage, and other applications of off-peak electrical energy,that cannot be adequately evaluated by the prescriptive or system performancealternatives found in sections 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, and 7.4. This compliancepath is intended for design comparisons only and is not intended to beused to either predict, document, or verify annual energy consumption orannual energy costs.11.1.2 The Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative is to be used inlieu of the prescriptive or system performance methods and in conjunctionwith the minimum requirements found in sections 3.3, 4.3, 5.3, 6.3, 7.3,8.3, 9.3 and 10.3.11.1.3 <T3>Compliance.</T3> Compliance under this method requires detailed energyanalyses of the entire Proposed Design, referred to as the Design EnergyConsumption; an estimate of annual energy cost for the proposed design,referred to as the Design Energy Cost; and comparison against an EnergyCost Budget. Compliance is achieved when the estimated Design Energy Costis less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget (see Figure 11-1). Thissection provides instructions for determining the Energy Cost Budget andfor calculating the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost. TheEnergy Cost Budget shall be determined through the calculation of monthlyenergy consumption and energy cost of a Prototype or Reference Buildingdesign configured to meet the requirements of sections 3.0 through 10.0.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 365</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C </ITAG>11.1.4 Designers are encouraged to employ the Building Energy Cost Budgetcompliance method set forth in this section for evaluating proposed designalternatives in preference to using the prescriptive/system methods. TheBuilding Energy Cost Budget establishes the relative effectiveness of eachdesign alternative in energy cost savings, providing an energy cost basisupon which the building owner and designer may select one design over another.This Energy Cost Budget is the highest allowable calculated Energy CostBudget for a specific building design. Other alternative designs are likelyto have lower annual energy costs and life cycle costs than those thatminimally meet the Energy Cost Budget.11.1.5 The Energy Cost Budget is a numerical target for annual energy cost.It is intended to assure neutrality with respect to choices of HVAC systemtype, architectural design, fuel choice, etc., by providing a fixed, repeatablebudget target that is independent of any of these choices wherever possible(i.e., for the prototype buildings). The Energy Cost Budget for a givenbuilding size and type will vary only with climate, the number of stories,and the choice of simulation tool. The specifications of the prototypesare necessary to assure repeatability, but have no other significance.They are not recommended energy conserving practice, or even physicallyreasonable practice for some climates or buildings, but represent a reasonableworst case of energy cost resulting from compliance with the spirit andthe letter of sections 3.0 through 10.0.11.2 Determination of the Annual Energy Cost Budget11.2.1 The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in accordancewith the Prototype Building Method in section 11.2.5, or the ReferenceBuilding Method in section 11.2.5. Both methods calculate an annual EnergyCost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each monthly EnergyCost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy Consumption ofeach type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy Cost per unitof energy for each type of energy used.11.2.2 The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance with Equation11-1 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">ECB=ECB<T2>jan</T2>+ . . .

These costs shall include demandcharges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptable service rates, deliverycharges, taxes, and all other applicable rates for the type, location,operation, and size of the proposed design. The monthly Budget Energy Consumptionshall be calculated from the first day through the last day of each month,inclusive.11.2.4 The Energy Cost Budget, Design Energy Consumption and Design EnergyCost calculations are applicable only for determining compliance with thesestandards. They are not predictions of actual energy consumption or costsof the proposed building after construction. Actual experience will differfrom these calculations due to variations such as occupancy, building operationand maintenance, weather, energy use not covered by these standards, changesin energy rates between design of the building and occupancy, and precisionof the calculation tool.11.2.5 Prototype Building Procedure11.2.5.1 The Prototype Building procedure shall be used for all buildingtypes listed below. For mixed-use buildings the Energy Cost Budget is derivedby allocating the floor space of each building type within the floor spaceof the prototype building. For buildings not listed below, the ReferenceBuilding procedure of section 11.2.5 shall be used.11.2.5.1.1 Prototype buildings include:(a) Assembly;(b) Office (Business);(c) Retail (Mercantile);(d) Warehouse (Storage);(e) School (Educational);(f) Hotel/Motel;(g) Restaurant;(h) Health/Institutional; and(i) Multi-Family.11.2.5.2 Use of the Prototype Building to Determine the Energy Cost Budget11.2.5.2.1 Determine the building type of the Proposed Design using thecategories in section 11.2.5.1. Using the appropriate Prototype Buildingcharacteristics from Tables 11-1 through 11-8, the building shall be simulatedusing the same gross floor area and number of floors for the PrototypeBuilding as in the Proposed Design.11.2.5.2.3 The form, orientation, occupancy and use profiles for the PrototypeBuilding shall be fixed as described in section 11.5.3. Envelope, lighting,other internal loads and HVAC systems and equipment shall meet the prescriptiveor system requirements of section 3.0 through 10.0 and are standardizedinputs.11.2.6 Reference Building Method11.2.6.1 The Reference Building procedure shall be used only when the ProposedDesign cannot be represented by one or a combination of the Prototype Buildinglisted in Section 11.2.5.1 or the assumptions for the Prototype Buildingin Section 11.5, such as occupancy and use-profiles, do not reasonablyrepresent the Proposed Design.11.2.6.2 Use of the Reference Building to Determine the Energy Cost Budget11.2.6.2.1 Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner for the ReferenceBuilding as in the Proposed Design. The form, gross and conditioned floorareas of each floor and the number of floors shall be the same as in theProposed Design. All other characteristics, such as lighting, envelopeand HVAC systems and equipment, shall meet the prescriptive/system requirementsof Section 3.0 through 10.0.11.2.7 Calculation Procedure and Simulation Tool11.2.7.1 The Prototype or Reference Buildings shall be modeled using thecriteria of section 11.5 and section 11.6. The modeling shall use a climatedata set appropriate for both the site and the complexity of the energyconserving features of the design. ASHRAE Weather Year for Energy Calculations(WYEC) data or bin weather data shall be a default choice.11.3 Determination of the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost11.3.1 The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling theProposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, andsimulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, exceptas explicitly stated in 11.5. The Design Energy Cost shall be calculatedper Equation 11-3. If the Proposed Design includes cogeneration or non-depletableenergy sources designed for the sale of energy off-site, then energy costand income resulting from outside sales shall not be used to reduce theDesign Energy Costs. Such systems shall be modeled as operating to supplyenergy needs of the Proposed Design only.<ITAG tagnum="26">DECOS=DECOS<T2>jan</T2>+ . . .

In order to maintain consistency between the Energy Cost Budgetand the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions to be used are statedbelow. These inputs shall be used to determine the Energy Cost Budget andthe Design Energy Consumption.11.5.2 Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation. Defaultassumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate that a differentassumption better characterizes the building's energy use over its expectedlife. No modified default assumptions shall be used in modeling both thePrototype or Reference Building and the Proposed Design unless the designerdemonstrates clear cause to do otherwise. Special procedures for speculativebuildings are discussed in section 11.5.9. Shell buildings may not usesection 11.0.11.5.3 Orientation and Shape11.5.3.1  The Prototype Building shall consist of the same number of stories,and gross and conditioned floor area as the Proposed Design, with equalarea per story. The building shape shall be rectangular, with a 2.5:1 aspectratio. The long dimensions of the building shall face East and West. Thisis intended to provide an energy budget that can be met even if there areunfavorable site constraints. The fenestration shall be uniformly distributedin proportion to exterior wall area.11.5.3.2 Floor-to-floor height for the Prototype Building shall be 13 ftexcept for dwelling units in hotels/motels and multi-family high rise residentialbuildings where floor-to-floor height shall be 9.5 ft.11.5.3.3 The Reference Building shall consist of the same number of stories,and gross floor area for each story as the Proposed Design. Each floorshall be oriented in the same manner as the Proposed Design. The geometricform shall be the same as the Proposed Design.11.5.4 Internal Loads11.5.4.1 The systems and types of energy specified in this section areintended only as constraints in calculating the Energy Cost Budget. Theyare not intended as either requirements or recommendations for either systemsor the type of energy to be used in the Proposed Design or for calculationof Design Energy Cost.11.5.4.2 Internal loads for multi-family high rise residential buildingsare presented in Table 11-1. These assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions.Internal loads for other building types shall be modeled as noted in thissubsection.11.5.4.2.1 Occupancy(a) Occupancy schedules shall be Default Assumptions. The same assumptionsshall be made in computing Design Energy Consumption as were used in calculatingthe Energy Cost Budget.(b) Table 11-2, Occupancy Density, establishes the density, in ft\2\/personof conditioned floor area, to be used for each building type. Table 11-3,Building Schedule Percentage Multipliers, establishes the percentage oftotal occupants in the building by hour of the day for each building type.11.5.4.2.2 Lighting(a) Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the EnergyCost Budget shall be determined from section 3.0. The lighting power usedto calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be the actual adjustedpower for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the lighting controls inthe Proposed Design are more effective at saving energy than those requiredby section 3.3, the actual installed lighting power shall be used alongwith the schedules reflecting the action of the controls to calculate theDesign Energy Consumption. This actual installed lighting power shall notbe adjusted by the Power Adjustment Factors listed in Table 3.5-2.(b) Lighting energy profiles are shown in Table 11-3 that establish thepercentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or ReferenceBuilding by hour of the day. These profiles are default assumptions andcan be changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget to provide, forexample, a 12 hour rather than an 8 hour work day.11.5.4.2.3 Receptacles(a) Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The same assumptionsshall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as were used incalculating the Energy Cost Budget.(b) Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are typicalin a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage and HVACprimary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 11-4, Receptacle Power Densities,establishes the density, in W/ft\2\, to be used for each building type.The receptacle energy profiles shall be the same as the lighting energyprofiles in Table 11-3. This profile establishes the percentage of thereceptacle load that is switched on by hour of the day and by buildingtype.11.5.5 Building Exterior Envelope11.5.5.1 Insulation and Glazing11.5.5.1.1 The insulation and glazing characteristics of the Prototypeand Reference Building envelope shall be determined by using the firstcolumn under ``Base Case'', with no assumed overhangs for the appropriateAlternate Component Tables (ACP) in section 5.0, as defined by climaterange. The insulation and glazing characteristics from this ACP are PrescribedAssumptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the EnergyCost Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the ProposedDesign, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be used.11.5.5.2 Infiltration11.5.5.2.1 For Prototype and Reference Buildings, infiltration assumptionsshall be prescribed assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budgetand default assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltrationshall impact perimeter zones only.11.5.5.2.2 When the HVAC system is switched ``on'', no infiltration shallbe assumed. When the HVAC system is switched ``off'', the infiltrationrate for buildings with or without operable windows shall be assumed tobe 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels and multi-familyhigh rise residential buildings shall have infiltration rates of 0.038cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall area at all times.11.5.5.3 Envelope and Ground Absorptivities11.5.5.3.1 For Prototype and Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptionsshall be prescribed assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget anddefault assumptions for computing the Design Energy Consumption.

The solar absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80%(20% reflectivity).11.5.5.4 Window Management11.5.5.4.1 For the Prototype and Reference Building, window managementdrapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for setting the EnergyCost Budget. No draperies shall be the default assumption for computingthe Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is assumed to be internally shadedby medium-weight draperies, closed one-half time. The draperies shall bemodeled by assuming that one-half the area in each zone is draped and one-halfis not. If manually-operated draperies, shades, or blinds are to be usedin the Proposed Design, the Design Energy Consumption shall be calculatedby assuming they are effective over one-half the glazing area in each zone.11.5.5.5 Shading11.5.5.5.1 For Prototype and Reference buildings and the Proposed Design,shading by permanent structures, terrain, and vegetation shall be takeninto account for computing energy consumption, whether or not these featuresare located on the building site. A permanent fixture is one that is likelyto remain for the life of the Proposed Design.11.5.6 HVAC Systems and Equipment11.5.6.1 The specifications and requirements for the HVAC systems of thePrototype and Reference Buildings shall be those in Table 11-5, HVAC Systemsfor Prototype and Reference Buildings. For the calculation of the DesignEnergy Consumption, the HVAC systems and equipment of the Proposed Designshall be used.11.5.6.2 The systems and types of energy presented in Table 11-5 are intendedonly as constraints in calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They are notintended as either requirements or recommendations for either systems orthe type of energy to be used in the Proposed Building or for the calculationof the Design Energy Cost.11.5.6.3 HVAC Zones11.5.6.3.1 HVAC zones for calculating the Energy Cost Budget of the Prototypeor Reference Building shall consist of at least four perimeter and oneinterior zones per floor. Prototype Buildings shall have one perimeterzone facing each cardinal direction. The perimeter zones of Prototype andReference Buildings shall be 15 ft in width, or one-third the narrow dimensionof the building, when this dimension is between 30 ft and 45 ft inclusive,or one-half the narrow dimension of the building when this dimension isless than 30 ft. Zoning requirements shall be a default assumption forcalculating the Energy Cost Budget. For multi-family high rise residentialbuildings, the prototype building shall have one zone per dwelling unit.The proposed design shall have one zone per unit unless zonal thermostaticcontrols are provided within units; in this case, two zones per unit shallbe modeled. Building types such as assembly or warehouse may be modeledas a single zone if there is only one space.11.5.6.3.2 For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, no fewer zonesshall be used than were in the Prototype and Reference Buildings. The zonesin the simulation shall correspond to the zones provided by the controlsin the Proposed Design. Thermally similar zones, such as those facing oneorientation on different floors, may be grouped together for the purposesof either the Design Energy Consumption or Energy Cost Budget simulation.11.5.6.4 Equipment Sizing and Redundant Equipment11.5.6.4.1 For calculating the Energy Cost Budget of Prototype or ReferenceBuildings, HVAC equipment shall be sized to meet the requirements of section7.3.2, without using any of the exceptions. The size of equipment shallbe that required for the building without process loads considered. Thedesigner shall determine the final equipment sizing including the processloads by separate calculations.

The ProposedDesign shall use the two-zone schedule only if zonal thermostatic controlsare provided. For Proposed Designs that use heat pumps employing supplementaryheat, the controls used to switch on the auxiliary heat source during morningwarm-up periods shall be simulated accurately. The thermostat assumptionsfor multi-family high-rise buildings are prescribed assumptions.11.5.8.4 When providing for outdoor air ventilation in calculating theEnergy Cost Budget, controls shall be assumed to close the outside airintake to reduce the flow of outside air to 0 cfm during setback and unoccupiedperiods. Ventilation using inside air may still be required to maintainscheduled setback temperature. Outside air ventilation, during occupiedperiods, shall be as required by <T3>ASHRAE Standard 62-1981,</T3> ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air,''or the Proposed Design, whichever is greater.11.5.8.5 If humidification is to be used in the Proposed Design, the samelevel of humidification and system type shall be used in the Prototypeor Reference Building. If dehumidification requires subcooling of supplyair, then reheat for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be fromrecovered waste heat such as condenser waste heat.11.5.9 Speculative Buildings11.5.9.1 Lighting11.5.9.1.1 The interior lighting power allowance (ILPA) for calculatingthe Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from Table 3.4-1. The DesignEnergy Consumption may be based on an assumed adjusted lighting power forfuture lighting improvements.(a) The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate the DesignEnergy Consumption must be documented so that the future installed lightingsystems may be in compliance with these standards. Documentation must beprovided to enable future lighting systems to use either the Prescriptivemethod of section 3.4 or the Systems Performance method of section 3.5.(b) Documentation for future lighting systems that use the Prescriptivemethod of section 3.4 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted lighting powerfor the tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power allowance for tenantspaces shall account for the lighting power provided for the common areasof the building.(c) Documentation for future lighting systems that use the System Performancemethod of section 3.5 shall be stated as a required lighting adjustment.The required lighting adjustment is the whole building lighting power assumedin order to calculate the Design Energy Consumption minus the ILPA valuefrom Table 3.4-1 that was used to calculate the Energy Cost Budget. Whenthe required lighting adjustment is less than zero, a complete lightingdesign must be developed for one or more representative tenant spaces,demonstrating acceptable lighting within the limits of the assumed lightingpower allowance.11.5.9.2 HVAC Systems and Equipment11.5.9.2.1 If the HVAC system is not completely specified in the plans,the Design Energy Consumption shall be based on reasonable assumptionsabout the construction of future HVAC systems and equipment. These assumptionsshall be documented so that future HVAC systems and equipment may be incompliance with these standards.11.6 The Simulation Tool11.6.1 Annual energy consumption shall be simulated with a multi-zone,8760 hours per year building energy model. The model shall account for:11.6.1.1 The dynamic heat transfer of the building envelope such as solarand internal gains;11.6.1.2 Equipment efficiencies as a function of load and climate;11.6.1.3 Lighting and HVAC system controls and distribution systems bysimulating the whole building; 11.6.1.4 The operating schedule of the building including night setbackduring various times of the year; and 11.6.1.5 Energy consumption information at a level necessary to determinethe Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost through the appropriate utilityrate schedules.11.6.2 While the simulation tool should simulate an entire year on an hourby hour basis (8760 hours), programs that approximate this dynamic analysisprocedure and provide equivalent results are acceptable.11.6.3 Simulation tools shall be selected for their ability to simulateaccurately the relevant features of the building in question, as shownin the tool's documentation. For example, a single zone model shall notbe used to simulate a large, multi-zone building, and a steady-state modelsuch as the degree-day method shall not be used to simulate buildings whenequipment efficiency or performance is significantly affected by the dynamicpatterns of weather, solar radiation, and occupancy. Relevant energy-relatedfeatures shall be addressed by a model such as daylighting, atriums orsunspaces, night ventilation or thermal storage, chilled water storageor heat recovery, active or passive solar systems, zoning and controlsof heating and cooling systems, and ground-coupled buildings. In addition,models shall be capable of translating the Design Energy Consumption intoenergy cost using actual utility rate schedules with the coincidental electricaldemand of a building. Examples of public domain models capable of handlingsuch complex building systems and energy cost translations available inthe United States are DOE-2.1C and BLAST 3.0 and in Canada, Energy SystemsAnalysis Series.11.6.4 All simulation tools shall use scientifically justifiable documentedtechniques and procedures for modeling building loads, systems, and equipment.The algorithms used in the program shall have been verified by comparisonwith experimental measurements, loads, systems, and equipment.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M014</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 385-400</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 435.112</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Building energy compliance alternative.</ITAG>12.1 General12.1 This section provides an alternative path for compliance with thestandards that allow for greater flexibility in the design of energy efficientbuildings using an annual energy target method. This path, as does thepath used in section 11.0, provides an opportunity for the use of innovativedesigns, materials, and equipment such as daylighting, passive solar heating,heat recovery, and thermal storage as well as other applications of off-peakelectrical energy where they cannot be adequately evaluated by the prescriptiveor system performance methods found in sections 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, 7.4.,and 9.4.12.1.2 The Building Energy Use Budget Target alternative may be used asan option to the Building Energy Cost Budget method in Section 11.0 andis to be used in lieu of the prescriptive and system performance methodsand in conjunction with sections 3.3, 4.3, 5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3 and10.3.12.1.3 Compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing that thecalculated annual energy usage for the Proposed Design is less than orequal to a calculated Energy Use Budget. (See Figure 12-1). A life-cyclecost economic analysis is required to evaluate alternative fuel sourcesand energy reduction strategies. The procedures in this chapter are intendedonly for establishing design compliance, and are not intended to be usedeither to predict, document or verify annual energy consumption or annualenergy costs.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 402</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C </ITAG>12.1.4 Compliance under the Building Energy Use Budget method requiresa detailed energy analysis, using a conventional simulation tool, of theProposed Design. A life-cycle cost analysis shall be used to select thefuel source for the HVAC systems, service hot water, and process loadsfrom available alternatives. The Annual Energy Consumption of the ProposedDesign with the life-cycle cost-effective fuel selection is calculatedto determine the modeled energy consumption, called the Design Energy Use.12.1.5 The Design Energy Use is defined as the energy that is consumedwithin the five foot line of a proposed building per ft2 over a 24 hourday, 365-day year period and specified operating hours. The calculatedDesign Energy Use is then compared to a calculated Energy Use Budget.12.1.6 <T3>Compliance.</T3> The Energy Use Budget is determined by calculatingthe annual energy usage for a Reference or Prototype Building that is configuredto comply with the provisions of Section 11.0 for such buildings, exceptthat the fuel source(s) of the Prototype or Reference Building shall bethe same life-cycle cost-effective source(s) selected for the ProposedDesign. If the Design Energy Use is less than or equal to the Energy UseBudget then the proposed design complies with these standards.12.1.7 This section provides instructions for determining the Design EnergyUse and for calculating the Energy Use Budget. The Energy Use Budget isthe highest allowable calculated annual energy consumption for a specifiedbuilding design. Designers are encouraged to design buildings whose DesignEnergy Use is lower than the Energy Use Budget. Incorporated in this sectionis an optional life-cycle cost economic analysis procedure that may beused by the designer to examine the economic feasibility of all energydesign alternatives and to produce a more optimum design.12.2 Determination of the Annual Energy Budget12.2.1 The Energy Use Budget shall be calculated for the appropriate Prototypeor Reference Building in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section11.2 with the following exceptions: The Energy Use Budget shall be statedin units of Btu/ft2. yr and the simulation tool shall segregate the calculatedenergy consumption by fuel type producing an Energy Use Budget for eachfuel (the fuel selections having been made by a life cycle cost analysisin determining the proposed design).12.2.2 The Energy Use Budget (EUB) is calculated similarly for the Referenceor Prototype Building using the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="20">EUB=EUB</ITAG><T2>1</T2>andmultiply;f<T2>1</T2>+EUB<T2>2</T2>andmultiply;f<T2>2</T2>+ . . . . . +EUB<T2>i</T2>andmultiply;f<T2>i</T2><ITAG tagnum="73">Equation 12-1</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Where EUB<T2>1</T2>, EUB<T2>2</T2>, . . .

Separate the output of theanalysis by fuel type.12.3.2.2.3 Determine the unit price of each fuel using information fromthe utility or other reliable local source. During rapid changes in fuelprices it is recommended that an average fuel price for the previous twelvemonths be used in lieu of the current price.

Estimate the initial cost of theHVAC and service water systems and other initial costs such as energy distributionlines and service connection fees associated with each fuel source alternative.Estimate other costs and benefits for each alternative including, but notnecessarily limited to, annual maintenance and repair, periodic and onetime major repairs and replacements and salvage of the energy and servicewater systems. Cost estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognizedcost estimating tools, guides and techniques.12.3.2.2.4 Perform a life cycle cost analysis using the procedure specifiedin section 12.3.2.12.3.2.2.5 Compare the total life cycle cost of each energy source alternative.The alternative with the lowest total life-cycle cost shall be chosen asthe energy source for the proposed design.12.4 Compliance12.4.1 Compliance with this section is demonstrated if the Design EnergyUse is equal to or less than the Energy Use Budget.<ITAG tagnum="26">DEUandgreater;EUB</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Equation 12-3</ITAG>12.4.2 The energy consumption shall be measured at the building five footline for all fuels.
