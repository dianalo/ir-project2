The restructuring will split the agency's Center for Drugs and Biologics -- the unit responsible for reviewing all new medications -- into two distinct sections, one charged with reviewing conventional drugs that are derived from chemicals, and the other with so-called biologics that are developed from natural materials.    Carl Peck, a physician and pharmacologist from the Department of Defense, who will head one of the sections, said the motivation for the change is twofold: &quot;improving the drug approval process, and providing a special focus for AIDS-related biologics.&quot; The proposed split and Dr. Peck's appointment are expected to become effective Oct. 19.    The drug industry and others have for years criticized the FDA's procedures as hindering the marketing of new drugs. But the agency has come under increased fire in recent months since an FDA panel rebuffed Genentech Inc.'s tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, a heart-attack drug.    TPA is a natural clot-dissolving protein synthesized with gene-splicing techniques. Such techniques have helped to produce confusion over the distinction between conventional drugs and biologics, a factor that contributed to the controversy over the FDA's handling of TPA.    Indeed, TPA was originally reviewed as a biologic, but late in its review -- to the company's surprise -- had to face scrutiny by a drug panel. The panel recommended against approving the drug as a heart attack medication.    Scientists see the restructuring as a move to clarify the review of all new medications, and to avoid turf struggles and confusion over whether a new medication is classified as a drug or biologic.    Dr. Peck, 45 years old, will head the new Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. He is now director of clinical pharmacology and professor of medicine and pharmacology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a Bethesda, Md.-based military medical school.    In an interview, Dr. Peck said he plans to bring a strong research focus to a drugs section that is now &quot;largely devoid&quot; of it. &quot;I have an interest in excellent research and in training,&quot; he said, which &quot;can have a role in reducing drug approval time and enhancing the quality of drug review.&quot;    The University of Kansas-educated physician denied speculation that the FDA's restructuring was simply a reaction to industry outcry over TPA. He said he began discussions with FDA Commissioner Frank Young in November 1986, long before the May 1987 TPA meeting.    However, he added: &quot;That's not to say that the TPA thing couldn't have been done better. One of the possible outcomes could be an attempt to avoid the kind of problems that occurred with TPA.&quot;    Paul Parkman, who has served as acting director of the Center for Drugs and Biologics, will head the new Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and given responsibility for products related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Scientists in industry and government said the restructuring will help drug development -- but only if the top-level changes filter down to mid-to-lower echelons of FDA.    Dr. Peck &quot;is a good scientist and a reasonable person,&quot; said Bruce A. Chabner, director of the division of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. &quot;I'm concerned only that the changes at the top may not reach the rank and file,&quot; he said.    John Jennings, vice president of science and technology of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, said Dr. Peck may have two scientists below him handling drug review. &quot;Two portals instead of one, (headed by) two fine scientists&quot; may mean speedier handling of new drug applications, Dr. Jennings said. &quot;But if that door is just painted on,&quot; he added, &quot;it may not change . . . a lot.&quot;    Biotechnology companies, shaken by the rebuff of Genentech's TPA, assessed the changes cautiously.    George Rathmann, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology company, said he is always &quot;shaken up&quot; by any change. &quot;But if it'll lead to streamlining, far be it from us to tell government what to do.&quot;    Samuel Ackerman, a former FDA official who is now a vice president of Xoma Corp., an Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology company, believes the shake-up won't slow down products, but added that it isn't a guarantee of speedier marketing approvals.    In South San Francisco, Calif., a Genentech spokeswoman said the company had no comment on FDA matters, especially while TPA is pending.    ---   Joe Davidson contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
