Speaking forcefully and at times with passion, Alfonsin spokebefore a packed, special session of Congress in a nationallybroadcast speech.   ``The tensions between the armed forces and the powers of thestate are a problem that had to be presented,'' he said. ``Themilitary transition is everyone's task.''   Later, Alfonsin named Gen. Francisco Gassino as army chief toreplace Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, who resigned Tuesday along withthe next two ranking army generals, Miguel Abbate and EnriqueBianchi.   Gassino's promotion forced into retirement four generals whooutranked him in seniority, bringing to eight the number of generalswho resigned or were retired after the latest military rebellionended on Dec. 4. Gassino, 57, played a major role in quashing thatuprising and strongly sided with Alfonsin during the April 1987 andJanuary 1988 garrison revolts.   Alfonsin said military-civilian stresses in Argentine societystem largely from harsh actions to end terrorist subversion in thelate 1970s, and for that all society is to blame, not just itssoldiers.   However, in a reference to the 1976-83 military dictatorshipwhich ended with his inauguration in December 1983, Alfonsin said,``That which neither the government nor the people are disposed togrant is the vindication of state terrorism.''   Both the governing Radical Civic Union and the oppositionPeronist Party have stressed that they would not propose or allowCongress to pass amnesty legislation for crimes dating from the``dirty war'' against subversion.   The president said Argentines need to create a new, democraticfuture, not rehash violent incidents of the past. Toward that end,citizens should accept the necessity of the armed forces, and themilitary should accept their subordination to civilian rule.   He said the question of blame ``should be the task ... ofhistorians.''   Alfonsin made little direct reference to the Dec. 1-4insurrection of up to 800 army troops, to Caridi's departure or tocharges that the government made a deal with rebels.   Congressmen of various political parties described the speech aspositive, though some grumbled it failed to address such specificquestions as how extensive was support among loyal troops for rebeldemands and whether a deal was in fact struck to end the revolt.   ``The message ... contains a declaration of principles in whichwe all coincide, but nothing was said about what happened,''complained Sen. Eduardo Menem, the Peronist leader in the upperhouse and brother of Carlos Menem, the Peronist presidential nomineein elections next May.   Sen. Leopoldo Bravo of the small, conservative Bloquista Party,who has publicly called for a military amnesty, said Alfonsin ``didnot come up with solutions that would permit a vision of hope forthe future.''   Rebels led by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin demanded a halt to theprosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed in thelate 1970s during what they refer to as the civil war againstsubversion.   Human rights groups say the arrest and presumed execution of atleast 8,900 Argentines, by government count, amounted to organizedmurder. Other estimates put the number of ``disappeared'' at up to30,000.   Rebels also demanded a shakeup of the military high command,including Caridi's ouster; higher salaries and a bigger militarybudget.   Alfonsin insists he made no deal. Nevertheless, soldiers weregranted a 20 percent pay increase this month and a $100 bonus.   Eight generals have been ousted, and high government officialshave spoken publicly of the ``dirty war'' as necessary, lendingcredence to military arguments that human rights trials should stop.   The trials in civilian court of about a dozen officers, includingformer President and army Commander-in-Chief Leopoldo Galtieri, aredue to resume soon after a lapse of about a year.</TEXT></DOC>
