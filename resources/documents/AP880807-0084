(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ron Gerhardt says the upturn in thealuminum industry can be measured in the extra bales of beer andsoda-pop containers coming through the doors of his Evansvillerecycling business.   U.S. aluminum makers, buoyed by high prices and a worldwideshortage of products, mostly have recovered from the depths of aslump two years ago and are posting record profits.   Tzschoppe Industries Recycling sends more than 10,000 pounds ofaluminum per week to Aluminum Company of America's nearby WarrickOperations, the largest aluminum smelter in the United States.   ``Recycling started kind of as an oddity, but now it's gettingto be the normal thing to do,'' said Gerhardt, company president.   The aluminum turnaround is welcome news in the lower OhioValley, where major aluminum producers, lured to the region byplentiful coal supplies and excellent river transportation, haveput three smelters within a 40-mile radius. The plants representabout 16 percent of the country's aluminum smelting capacity.   Pittsburgh-based Alcoa is completing a four-year, $300 millionmodernization at the southern Indiana plant. A similar program isunder way at the company's Alcoa, Tenn., smelter just outside ofKnoxville.   Other nearby smelters include National-Southwire Aluminum inHawesville, Ky., and Alcan Aluminum in Sebree, Ky., where $15.5million in plant improvements have begun. The company shut downfour production lines in 1985-86.   ``Aluminum was going down the same path as steel was in the1980s,'' said Mike Deshaies, Alcoa spokesman in Indiana. ``So westarted cutting back the high-cost, low-profit end of thebusiness.''   Alcoa, the nation's largest producer, announced a 25 percentreduction in smelting capacity three years ago and other producerstook similar steps, closing less efficient plants and idlingproduction lines.   ``The industry was trimming down to fighting weight, so tospeak,'' said Frank Rathbun, spokesman for the Aluminum Associationin Washington.   Foreign countries with large reserves of raw material orelectric power _ a major cost component of aluminum _ could producethe metal more cheaply.   But recovering aluminum prices, up from about 40 cents per poundtwo years ago to around $1.20 in late July, have generated recordprofits for some of the major producers.   Alcoa reported profits of $200.1 million, or $2.25 per share, onsales of $7.77 billion for all of 1987 and profits of $416.3million, or $4.71 per share, on sales of $4.59 billion in the firstsix months of this year.   Reynolds of Richmond, Va., reported 1987 net earnings of $219.5million, or $4.33 per share, on sales of $4.32 billion and netearnings of $204.9 million, or $3.84 per share, on revenue of $2.65billion in the 1988 first half.   Labor unions that agreed to concessions during the slump alsohave noticed the boom times, and will be looking to share in theprofits when they negotiate their next contract.   The current two-year pacts with the United Steelworkers ofAmerica and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers InternationalUnion lowered benefits by 95 cents per hour for their members atAluminum Company of America and Reynolds Metals Co.   Talks on a new contract are scheduled to begin Monday inCincinnati. The old pacts expire May 31, 1989.   ``This is a very good time from the standpoint of bargaining,''said Larry E. Sigler, president of Local 104, which representsworkers at the Newburgh plant.   While celebrating the boom, industry leaders are cautious aboutcompetition from steel producers and also warn that metal pricesare cyclical.   A weakening of the western economies that use aluminum inhousing, containers and construction could send prices tumblingagain. No one knows how long the good times will last.   ``If you find 15 aluminum analysts in New York who want to talkto you about what's happening, you'll come up with 17 differentexplanations,'' said Alcan spokesman Stan Lampe.</TEXT></DOC>
