Sea-Land, like the majority of such companies, probably will do that. And so for most U.S. expatriates, while the new law will change their tax positions, the impact will be felt primarily by their employers.    &quot;It's going to be much more expensive to have Americans abroad,&quot; Robert Sharpenberg, a partner at accountants Ernst andamp; Whinney, predicts. The number of U.S. executives abroad &quot;is going down anyway,&quot; he says, for various reasons. He expects the new law to accelerate the trend, notably in high-tax areas such as Japan and Western Europe.    Accountants and corporate finance officials haven't yet arrived at firm estimates of what it will cost companies to equalize employees' tax positions under the new law. But the average executive overseas &quot;isn't going to pay that much more,&quot; Israel A. Press, a partner at Touche Ross andamp; Co., says. Thomas M. Nee, a vice president at American Home Products Corp., agrees that the law &quot;probably isn't going to have a dramatic impact&quot; on expatriates.    Mr. Sharpenberg, however, says one &quot;major surprise&quot; that may be in store for many executives overseas is the alternative minimum tax. Under the previous law, 100% of an individual's foreign tax credits could be used to offset potential liability to this tax. Now, only 90% can be used; and the alternative minimum tax rate has been raised to 21% from 20%.    &quot;It will apply to a lot of people,&quot; Mr. Sharpenberg predicts. Another accounting firm estimates that a typical U.S. expatriate earning $192,000 a year might pay about $2,200 more in tax in 1987 than in 1985 because of this tax.    The main change for most individuals will be a reduction in the amount of income earned abroad that can be excluded from U.S. taxes, to $70,000 a year from $80,000. (The exclusion was scheduled to rise under the old law to $85,000 in 1988, $90,000 in 1989 and $95,000 thereafter.) However, the effect will be largely academic to U.S. residents covered by a company tax-equalization program.    One provision of the new law that might save the expatriate some taxes applies to certain real estate transactions. Tax shelters have been sharply curtailed by the law. But individuals with real estate investments can deduct as much as $25,000 in losses from their adjusted gross income if that income is less than $100,000. Because expatriates can exclude as much as $70,000 earned overseas from their adjusted gross incomes, many may find that they can take advantage of the real estate loss provision.    Other parts of the new code are designed to increase tax-law compliance by U.S. citizens abroad. Persons applying for or renewing passports, for example, will have to fill out a separate information form for the Internal Revenue Service -- as will foreigners applying for permanent-resident status in the U.S.    The bill also directs employers to begin withholding tax from pension payments sent to foreign addresses unless the taxpayer can show the withholding isn't appropriate. And a provision with political overtones could affect a few taxpayers: The $70,000 exemption will be denied for those working in nations subject to official U.S. travel restrictions, such as Libya, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and Cambodia.    And what of the rich expatriates, the entrepreneurs ensconsed on low-tax islands or those living on dividends? Thomas Donnelly, a partner at Pannell Kerr Forster, says many such people already have tidy systems for converting investment income to earned income by setting up companies and paying themselves salaries. The expectation is that they will be affected by the new law to about the same extent as the rich living in the U.S.    ---   Mr. Northrup is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
