On theother hand, this process can, in some instances, such as the developmentof laser sources in fibers, result in unwanted effects. In this paper,the efficiency of the two photon upconversion process in heavy metalfluoride glasses and in halide crystals is reviewed. Methods for increasingor reducing the efficiency of the upconversion process as applicableto display, optical detection devices and the formation of efficientlaser systems in fibers are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
