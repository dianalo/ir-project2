Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted alate bid of $408.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $411 lateTuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, a troy ounce of goldfell to $408.70 from $410.80 on Tuesday.   Currency dealers said the dollar rose on news that U.S. fighterplanes shot down two Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean. TheU.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of internationaltension.   ``The dollar did snap back quite a bit,'' said Robert Hatcher,vice president of corporate foreign exchange in the New York officeof Britain's Barclays Bank PLC.   He described the dollar buying as a ``flight to quality''prompted by the incident in the Mediterranean.   In addition, many traders are said to be expecting Friday'sgovernment report on unemployment for December to show strong jobgrowth. Such a showing could prompt the Federal Reserve to raiseinterest rates to rein in growth, a move which would boost thedollar, analysts said.   Before European markets opened, the dollar fell in Tokyo againstthe Japanese yen on the first day of trading there after the NewYear holiday. Dealers in Tokyo said there was massive selling ofdollars after excessive buying at the end of 1988.   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.05 Japanese yen, down fromFriday's 125.90 yen before the holiday. In London late Wednesday thedollar traded higher at 124.95 yen. By the end of trading in NewYork, the dollar was quoted at 124.97 yen, up from 123.82 yen lateTuesday.   The dollar's fall in Tokyo didn't seem to affect dealing inEurope, where the U.S. currency rose after the opening on the heelsof a large number of commercial orders and expectations of higherinterest rates.   The dollar also gained against the British pound, which lost itstwo cent gain of Tuesday, dropping back to $1.8065 from $1.8270.
