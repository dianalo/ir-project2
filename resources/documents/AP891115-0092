Also today, East Germany's official news agency said nearly halfits 16.5 million people have been issued visas for the West sincetravel restrictions were lifted on Thursday.   ADN quoted an unidentified Interior Ministry official as saying7,765,881 visas for West Berlin and West Germany had been approvedby this morning.   Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaperBerliner Zeitung that East Germany can manage its own economicrecovery, an indication that Bonn's conditional aid offer may berejected.   ``I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or externalfinancial situation'' of East Germany, Arnold was quoted as saying.   The government newspaper Bauern-Echo, aimed at East Germany'sfarmers, warned of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany.   ``Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout,''the paper declared. ``Yes to meeting again, no to reunification.The two German states are politically and economically toodiverse.''   There was no official response from the government to WestGermany's offer, which would require Easter Germany's rulingCommunists to fundamentally reform their centrally planned economy.Communist officials have made clear they do not favor a fullfree-market system.   In Frankfurt, West Germany's third-largest bank said it wouldseek to open an office in East Berlin. The proposal by Commerzbank,however, requires the approval of authorities in both Germanys andWest Berlin.   Gorbachev, believed to have encouraged the ouster of hard-lineEast German leader Erich Honecker and the dizzying reforms that ledto the Berlin Wall's opening, warned Westerners not to gloat overthe demise of Communism in the East bloc.   ``When accusations of `exporting revolutions' are replaced withcalls for `exporting capitalism,' we have at hand a dangerousmanifestation of old thinking,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev assaying Tuesday in Moscow.   Even leaders of New Forum, the East German opposition groupleading massive protest marches for democratic change, haveexpressed concern that Western capitalists might exploit anunstable East Germany without helping its people.   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper said outsiders should notinterfere with East Germany's economic reforms.   ``East Germany needs no patronage. The society of East Germanyis strong enough to improve its economic performance,'' he said.``The citizens want self-determination and do not want to exchangethe decades of Communist Party tutelage for the patronage of theWest German state or society.''   West Germany's economics minister, Helmut Haussmann, offeredTuesday to rebuild East Germany's economy through broad-basedinvestments and joint ventures and to overhaul it moribundcommunications and transport systems.   While not offering details, Haussmann likened his plan to thebrainchild of U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall thatrevitalized postwar Western Europe with an infusion of $12 billion.   But he said such aid would be made available only if EastGermany carried out a ``thorough change'' of its centrally plannedeconomy.   East Germany's new premier, Hans Modrow, is known to favorgradual economic change and oppose a swift transition to fulldemocracy.   Modrow, a 61-year-old Communist reformer confirmed by Parliamentas premier on Monday, has resisted recognition of unofficial groupsas viable opposition forces or negotiating partners.   Modrow has said the government has no intention of tearing downthe Berlin Wall, which it opened to free travel in an effort tohalt an exodus of refugees and appease a public that has taken tothe streets en masse since early October to demand free electionsand other reforms.   In the newest challenge to the Communists' supremacy, ParliamentSpeaker Guenther Maleuda said Tuesday he would seek to amend theconstitution so the Communist Party is no longer deemed the leadingforce in society.   Maleuda, elected by Parliament Monday in the chamber'sfirst-ever secret ballot, made the remark at a meeting of hisDemocratic Peasants Party _ one of the four formal oppositionparties that have recently begun to assert independence.   The Liberal Democratic Party also called for increasedpower-sharing. It urged convening talks, to include the unofficialopposition, patterned after negotiations held in Poland that helpedusher in the Solidarity-led government.   In a development heralding the possible inclusion of anotherprominent reformer in the government, Politburo member GuentherSchabowski resigned as Berlin's Communist boss.   Schabowski, the party's propaganda chief, had announcedThursday's opening of East Germany's borders. His resignation wasconsidered a possible prelude to his appointment to an influentialpost in the government.   A celebration began at the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday after ADNsaid the East Germany leadership was contemplating a new hole inthe Berlin Wall that would reconnect the central monument with theWest.   In West Berlin, revelers who waited in excited anticipation ofreopening of the famed thoroughfare dwindled to a few hundred afterdawn when rumors spread that the new East-West crossing would openonly on Thursday.   East Germany's Red Cross said, meanwhile, that it is setting upreception centers for any East Germans who fled to the West and nowwant to return.   It said the centers can handle up to 10,000 people. The WestGerman Red Cross said it did not expect many of the 200,000 whohave fled to the West this year to return.   The emigration has seriously depleted East Germany's labor force.</TEXT></DOC>
