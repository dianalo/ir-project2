The jury returned guilty verdicts on all but one of 64 felony counts involving a variety of acts of conspiracy, racketeering, and securities, wire and mail fraud.    The verdict is a huge victory for prosecutors in their controversial effort to apply the potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, to securities transactions. And it seemed likely to pave the way for more indictments in the government's continuing war on Wall Street corruption.    At the end of a trial that lasted five weeks, the jury of nine men and three women took less than three days of deliberation to convict. The jurors found that all the defendants were guilty of cheating the government out of taxes and of running afoul of RICO, which provides for prison sentences of as long as 20 years for each count and forfeiture of illegally gotten gains.    In an indictment first brought a year ago, the government charged the six defendants with conspiring to create illegitimate tax losses through a series of prearranged securities transactions. In these deals, Princeton/Newport allegedly sold securities at a loss and then repurchased them by prior agreement at the same or slightly higher prices; such a practice is known as stock parking. The defendants faced an expanded indictment in January.    To prove its case, the government relied largely on dozens of tape-recorded conversations between several of the defendants and traders at several other securities firms, including Drexel, First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Among the government's witnesses were William Ward Hale, a former trader at Princeton/Newport who was fired in 1987, and Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer.    The government charged that between 1984 and 1986, Princeton/Newport created fraudulent tax deductions by engaging in rigged and prearranged trades in 59 different securities transactions. The government also alleged that Princeton/Newport helped Drexel manipulate the price of C.O.M.B. Co. stock on behalf of Drexel and illegally parked Mattel Co. stock for Drexel.    The defendants in the case were James Sutton Regan, the managing general partner of Princeton/Newport, and Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all of whom were general partners of the investment firm. Also convicted were Steven B. Smotrich, Princeton/Newport's comptroller, and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel junk-bond trader who worked for Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk-bond operations.    Mr. Newberg faces yet another trial next year, along with Mr. Milken, on charges that are related in part to alleged wrongdoing by Drexel in trading with Princeton/Newport. Yesterday's verdict, returned late in the day, is a major coup in the government's continuing investigation of Mr. Milken, certain other current and former Drexel employees, and several Drexel clients.    Prosecutors are understood to have hoped that Mr. Newberg would become a witness against Mr. Milken in return for a more lenient sentence if he was convicted in this case. A teary-eyed Mr. Newberg had no comment after the verdict was read. Fred Hafetz, one of his attorneys, said Mr. Newberg would appeal.    Defense lawyers in the case and others complained that the use of RICO against the six defendants in this tax-related case was a significant misuse of the statute.    The Justice Department also has seemed somewhat concerned lately. Last month, Paul Coffey, a Justice Department official, was understood to have told attorneys for some current and former Drexel employees who may soon be indicted that approval of RICO charges against those individuals was being held up pending the outcome of the Princeton/Newport case. The Justice Department must approve all RICO charges before they can be brought.    The victory may prove to be a vindication of Rudolph Giuliani, the former U.S. attorney now running for mayor of New York City, and Bruce Baird, the chief of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office's securities-fraud unit. Messrs. Giuliani and Baird were sorely criticized by defense attorneys last year who said that they were attempting to bludgeon defendants in this case into testifying against others by charging them with racketeering.    &quot;The government brought this case to terrorize these people into becoming witnesses&quot; against Mr. Milken and Robert Freeman, said Paul Grand, an attorney for Mr. Zarzecki, in an interview shortly before the verdict was returned. Mr. Freeman, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., was indicted in 1987 on insider-trading-related charges. Those charges were later dropped and the government has said it intends to seek an expanded indictment.    Jack Arsenault, a lawyer for Mr. Berkman, said that Mr. Baird told him in August 1988 that if Mr. Berkman was willing to &quot;cooperate, fine,&quot; but if not, &quot;we are going to roll right over you to get where we want to go.&quot;    Mr. Baird denied ever having made such a statement. Yesterday, he declined to comment on the verdict in this case.    Mr. Regan, the lead defendant in this case, is a close friend of Mr. Freeman. The two went to Dartmouth College together in the 1960s and have frequently done business together since. Some lawyers who weren't connected with the Princeton/Newport case have said in recent days that it is likely that a new indictment of Mr. Freeman would be sought after the Princeton/Newport case ends. Mr. Freeman's attorneys couldn't be reached to comment.    Because the defendants were found guilty of racketeering, the jurors will begin today to consider the amount that the government may seek from defendants in asset forfeitures. Under RICO, the government can require forfeiture of ill-gotten gains and certain other assets. Jurors weren't permitted to give interviews pending those deliberations. The government had tied up about $22 million in assets belonging to all six defendants before the trial began.    The verdict is likely to be viewed as an affirmation of Drexel's wisdom in agreeing in December to plead guilty to six felony counts, including one relating to trading with Princeton/Newport, rather than face RICO charges. Drexel had been criticized by lawyers for defendants in the Princeton/Newport case for agreeing to plead guilty.    Shortly before jurors returned the verdict yesterday afternoon, Mr. Zarzecki, a defendant in the case, turned to relatives of other defendants and turned up his thumbs in a gesture of confidence. But as jury foreman Ralph Jimenez, a bus driver, began to read the verdict, most of the defendants sat emotionless and numb. For most of the half hour it took Mr. Jimenez to recite the jury's findings, the wives of all of the defendants cried in disbelief.    Theodore Wells, Mr. Regan's attorney, said he planned to appeal, although he didn't say on what grounds. Mr. Grand said all of the defendants could be expected to appeal, partly on the grounds that U.S. District Judge Robert Carter wouldn't allow testimony from two tax experts that the defendants wished to call.    The defendants are also likely to appeal on the grounds that their attorneys were so limited by the judge in what they could ask Mr. Joseph on cross-examination, that it seemed worthless to do anything at all. </TEXT></DOC>
