Thompson-style &quot;gonzo&quot; journalism--a journalist just can'tstand back and merely cover it.andM;How else can one describe trying to navigate the aisles, hoping against hopethat you're in the right convention hall, and that booth No.andP;  1925 is justaround the corner.andP;  You recall the frustration of getting turned around forthe umpteenth time, existing on hot dogs and tepid beer, and how the steadilyincreasing weight of your backpack, loaded with product data sheets, madeyour shoulders hurt almost as much as you feet.andM;Yes, everyone in Las Vegas during Comdex week is forced to experience whatcould pass for the world's largest demo derby (as in demonstration, notdemolition).andP;  This is true even of those poor visitors who aren't aware thatmore network drivers than chauffeurs would be in Vegas that week.andM;Comdex does have its moments.andP;  for instance, watching show visitors inMicrosoft's booth scramble for the foam-rubber OS/2 footballs being passedout.andP;  Or trying to figure out what a small software firm from Taipei or Seoulor the Canadian northwoods expected to gain by exhibiting in a tiny booth ina corner of a Godforesaken casino's converted ballroom.andM;Amidst this chaos, some real business-related things were happenning.andP;  Wecan't begin to report on every seemingly important announcement at Comdex;the electronics industry is growing so fast, there were just too many.andP;  Thatsaid, we'll get on with some of the more noteable product releases,milestones, and what-have-yous.andM;For the RecordandM;For those into trade show numbers, Comdex began its second decade with somerecords: 1,740 companies from 22 countries exhibited their wares; theyconverged on 10 different venues.andP;  The exhibitions covered 930,000 squareft., and the show's producer said 120,000-plus attended Comdex.andM;As a press release that a company put out noted, this was quite a change fromthe first Comdex (it stands for Computer Distribution EXpo), held in 1979 inthe MGM Grand.andP;  Fewer than 4,000 attended that one, with 157 companiesdisplaying products.andP;  Other interesting Comdex statistics: Putting up all thbooths at Comdex encompasses about 125,000 &quot;man hours&quot; of work: tearing themdown another 50,000.andP;  If one person worked 37.5 hours a week, 50 weeks ayear, it would take him or her 66.6 years to set up the show, another 26.6 totera is down.andM;The Big AnnouncementsandM;Two of Comdex's myriad press conferences, a joint one hosted by IBM andMicrosoft, the second by Novell, stood out.andP;  There was little &quot;hard&quot; news ateither, but lots of attendees at both.andM;In one of the more ballyhooed announcements, IBM and Microsoft revealed plansto &quot;broaden the scope of their development partnership and have agreed todevelop jointly a consistent, full range of systems software offerings forthe 1990s.&quot;andP;  In practice, the two industry giants intend to beef up theirefforts to promote OS/2 and Presentation Manager while creating a leaner,Less-RAM hungry edition of OS/2 (see News, p. 6.)andM;Novel handed the first copy of the NetWare Programmer's Workbench to NormFrancis, vice president of development for Computer Associates.andP;  The toolkitwas missing a very critical element--the remote procedure call tool that letsdevelopers recompile code written to one networking protocol to run onanother.andP;  NetWare RPC was slated to ship in December 1989.andM;Software developers can use this toolkit to develop client-serverapplications, including NetWare Loadable Modules, for NetWare 386.andP;  Inaddition to NetWare RPC, the toolkit includes a prerelease version of theNetWare 386 3.1 Software Developers Kit, a library of C and POSIX compliantroutines, the Novell/Watcom C Network Compiler for compiling clientapplications, and the C Network Compiler/386 for compiling serverapplications.andP;  Both compilers include Novell's Btrieve for record management.andM;The NetWare Programmer's Workbench is available to qualified Novell StrategicPartners for $3,995.andP;  The C Network Compiler/386 and C Network Compiler canbe purchased through standard Novell channels for $995 and $695,respectively.andM;EISA Finally a RealityandM;The &quot;gang of nine&quot; grew to more than two dozen as that number of vendorseither announced or demonstrated products, primarily adapter boards, designedfor the 32-bit Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus.andP;  The &quot;gangof nine&quot; was so named because the EISA bus was developed by nine companies,spearheaded by Compaq Computers (houston, Texas), which released itsSystem-pro EISA-based computer the week before Comdex.andP;  EISA proponents weremuch in evidence at Comdex, hanging large banners from their booths and, inmany cases, handing out ISA/EISA pins to visitors.andM;Among the vendors showing EISA products were Madge Networks (Token Ringadapter), Novell (Ethernet adapter), Standard Microsystems (Arcnet adapter),Proteon (Token Ring adapter), Cogent Data Technology (Ethernet adapter),Thomas-Conrad (Arcnet adapter) and AST Research (two 486-based computers).andO;Others included Adaptec (small computer systems interface [SCSI] diskcontroller board) and Codenoll (Fiber Distributed Data Interface [FDDI]card).andM;Madge Networks, the San Jose, Calif-based winner of the LAN Drag Race,announced the Smart 16/4 EISA Ringnode.andP;  This Token Ring interface card cantransfer data up to the maximum speed of the EISA bus--that's 33M bytes persecond.andM;The Smart 16/4 EISA Ringnode is the first product to use Madge's Smart Serversoftware, which uses the bus master capabilities of EISA and Micro Channel.andO;Using the bus master concept, the Ringnode can take full advantage of EISA'sburst mode, the fastest of the bus master modes.andM;The Smart Server software runs on the dedicated communications processor onthe Token Ring adapter, thereby bypassing bootlenecks normally associatedwith Tokien Ring adapters.andP;  This allows the server to maintain networkcommunication with several networks at the same time.andM;Another neat feature of the Ringnode, and all of Madge's Token Ring cards, isthat the network protocols such as NetBIOS or SPX are down-loaded to 128KBonboard ROM.andP;  This can free up as much as 50KB of DOS memory.andP;  Plus, it makesthe card faster.andM;The Smart 16/4 EISA Ringnode will be available at $1,495 in small quantitiesduring the first quarter of 1990.andP;  Volume shipments will occur during thesecond quarter.andM;Proteon's (Westboro, Mass.) ProNet-4/16 EISA network card supports bothshielded and unshielded twisted-pair wire of 4M- and 16M-bits-per-secondToken Ring data transfers.andP;  The board is compatible with Proteon's Series 70Intelligent Wire Centers and ProNet-4 adapters, and supports both the LANManager and Novell NetWare operating system environments.andM;AST's (Irvine, Calif.) 25 MHz Premium 486/25TE tower is designed to operatein multiuser and file server environments, an AST spokesperson said.andP;  Itcontains 10 EISA expansion slots that support existing 8-, 16- and 32-bit ISAexpansion cards.andP;  The Premium 486/25TD can support six EISA bus masterboards, which can operate in a multiprocessor environment.andM;AST also announced a Premium 486/25E desktop machine.andP;  The tower and desktopcomputers are based on AST's so-called Cupid-32 (Completely UniversalProcessor, I/O Design) architecture.andP;  This design separates the processor andmemory from the I/O and BIOS.andM;Not every card maker was crowing about EISA.andP;  Thomas-Conrad (Austin, Texas)had a different reason to strut.andP;  It is one of two companies that has Arcnetcards for the MAcintosh.andP;  Thomas-Conrad already announced an Arcnet card forthe NuBus, and at Comdex, it was showing Arcnet cards for the Mac SE andSE/30.andM;Basides its own LocalTalk, Apple supports Ethernet and Token Ring but notArcnet, leaving many NetWare users out in the cold.andP;  Much of Arcnet'spopularity is due to the preponderance of Novell networks.andP;  Thanks toThomas-Conrad (as well as Actinet in San Jose, Calif.), Mac users can nowhave Arcnet.andM;Thomas-Conrad's Macintosh Arc-Cards work with twisted-pair, high-impedancecoax, or fiber optics.andP;  The twisted pair implementation is unique toThomas-Conrad.andP;  It uses an RS-485 signalling that permits for 800-ft.andP;  spansand bus configurations of over 30 workstations.andP;  The high-impedance coaxversion supports a 1,000-ft.andP;  bus topology of up to eight workstations.andO;Fiber offers the greatest distance--8,000 ft., plus immunity from noise andno emission of electromagnetic signals.andP;  Arc-Cards will begin shipping duringthe first quarter of 1990, and pricing will start just below $500.andM;Database FrenzyandM;Although many Comdex exhibits are not network companies, their products oftenindicate the future of networking.andP;  As the use of imaging increases, LANbandwidth will be in even greater demand.andP;  Optical disks, graphicsapplications, and color laser printers will contribute to the need for LANbandwidth.andP;  The price of color printers will come down, and as it does,people will print files that are several MB large, not just a couple of KB.andM;Database servers are finally more than just talk.andP;  Whereas last year,database vendors could only promise that the client-server architecture wouldbring better performance, added flexibility, and more efficientcommunication, today users can see for themselves.andP;  Although Informix,Oracle, Gupta, and Microsoft were there, Ashton-Tate was curiously absent.andM;Gupta Technologies (Menlo Park, Calif.) showed the benchmarks for its SQLBasedatabase server.andP;  According to the recent tests performed by the independentdatabase consulting firm Codd and Date, SQLBase is faster than SQL Server andOracle.andM;Oracle (Belmont, Calif.) showed the long-awaited, recently-announced OracleServer for OS/2.andP;  Oracle for OS/2 runs on many operating systems and networkoperating systems and is speedy to boot.andP;  How does it stack up?andP;  Microsoft'sSQL Server runs only on OS/2 LAN Manager and can only communicate using NamedPipes.andP;  Gupta's OS/2 database server runs on Named Pipes and NetBIOSnetworks.andP;  Oracle's server supports Novell's SPX, Named Pipes, and NetBIOs.andO;Gupta can run on DOS, OS/2, and UNIX.andP;  Microsoft can claim only OS/2.andP;  Oraclehas the PC operating systems covered, plus UNIX, VMS and MVS.andM;Oracle Server for OS/2 can transparently access IBM's DB2 and SQL/DS as wellas DEC's RMS.andP;  Gupta's SQLBase can transparently access DB2.andP;  SQL Server canget to neither.andP;  Oracle for OS/2 requires an OS/2 PC with a minimum of 8MB ofRAM and 30MB of hard disk storage.andP;  It costs $2,499.andM;Informix (Menlo Park, Calif.) was showing its new, fault-tolerant, multimediadatabase engine, Informix-OnLine.andP;  This is the first mainstream databasecompany to offer this capability.andP;  OnLine lets users integrate wordprocessing documents, graphs, spreadsheets with digitized and scanned images,facsimiles, and voice into a UNIX-based database.andP;  A single field of a recordmay be up to two GB.andP;  These objects are accesible through SQL.andP;  OnLine givesusers fast, constant access to their data.andP;  Data is archived incrementallyand all disks are mirrored.andM;Informix-Star is complementary to OnLine.andP;  Informix-Star allows Informixdatabases on UNIX hosts to be truly distributed.andP;  Informix-Star providesdistributed optimization, location transparency, and site autonomy.andP;  Acost-based optimizer analyzes all possible alternatives before determiningthe most efficient way to execute a query across a network.andP;  Unlike somedistributed databases, Informix does not use a static rule-based optimizer.andO;Because the Informix optimizer is dynamic, network traffic is minimized.andM;Local transparency is key to qualifying a database as distributed.andP;  It meansInformix-Star users can access and manipulate data without knowing exactlywhere it resides.andP;  As for the network administrator, it means he or she canchange the network and database configuration without changing theapplication.andP;  Each databased server is independent of other servers.andP;  Withsite autonomy, if one server fails, the others continue to run.andM;Microrim (Redmond, Wash.) entered the client-server database market withVanguard.andP;  Although the pieces won't start to appear until the summer of1990, the makers of R:Base say its next-generation database will run on OS/2Presentation Manager, a future extended memory version of Microsoft Windows,Macintosh, VMS, UNIX, MVS, and VM.andM;Vanguard is the server portion; Vanguard Surfaces are the client pieces.andO;Both the nontechnical person interested in decision support and thesophisticated user wanting to develop applications will have VanguardSurfaces.andP;  For the nontechnical users, an object-oriented interface willguide such users through ad hoc data management.andM;This same type of interface will allow other people to develop applicationswithout doing the programming.andP;  Developers can use the Vanguard Compiler tomaximize performance of applications written in Vanguard's SQL basedprogramming language.andP;  Microrim won't leave its R:Base behind.andP;  It willdevelop a client version of R:Base to work with Vanguard.andM;On The FloorandM;As we roamed the Main Hall and many hotels, we found lots of nifty products.andM;A better InBox.andP;  The Tops division of Sun Microsystems (Alameda, Calif.) usedComdex to unveil its new electronic mail products, version 3.0 InBox andInBox Plus.andP;  InBox is an entry-level E-mail system for workgroups of up to 20users; InBox Plus permits segmenting 100-user workgroups into message centerscapable of communicating through gateways to mainframe- andminicomputer-based mail systems, including IBM's Profs and VMS Mail.andM;In operation, the two provide a flexible E-mail environment that rivals3Com's 3+ and (and 3+Open) Mail for features and ease of use.andP;  According toTops, the two products are so easy to use and install, they do not requirethe presence of a central administrator.andP;  And both can reside on a PC or Mac.andM;In addition to letting users create storage &quot;in-boxes&quot; on local drives, InBoxand InBox Plus let users assemble personal &quot;address books&quot; with lists ofother network users they frequently send E-mail to.andP;  This allows the user tosee only those names in the address book, not everyone on the network, whichspeeds sending E-mail.andM;InBox Plus allows for creation of distribution lists for company-widerouting.andP;  Such lists help organize E-mail lists for departments or productteams, even when those on the list reside in different message centers.andP;  Thelocal storage-box feature lets users organize incoming drafts alphabeticallyor by date, for instance.andP;  They also reduce the memory needs of the serveracting as the message center.andM;Both packages run on the Macintosh Plus, SE, SE/30, and Mac II line as wellas IBM PC, XT, AT or compatibles and PS/2 Model 25, or higher with a minimumof 512K, and both run over LocalTalk or Ethernet cabling.andP;  They run onNovell's NetWare, 3Com's 3+, the LAN MAnager, Apple's AppleShare, and Tops'own Tops/DOS and Tops/Mac applications.andP;  Available via computer dealers andsoftware stores.andP;  InBox 3.0 will retail for $329, InBox Plus for $995.andM;LAN in a pocket.andP;  Although many companies are selling products that connectthe laptop to the LAN, few are as innovative as Xircom's (Woodland Hills,Calif.).andP;  The Pocker LAN Adapter plugs into the parallel port of any IBMcompatible laptop, so it can be used with any manufacturer's computer.andP;  ThePocket LAN Adapter does not weigh as much as the laptop.andP;  In fact, it isabout the size of a garage door opener.andP;  The Pocket LAN Adapter does notdemand a complex installation process nor a docking bay on the user's desk.andO;Until Comdex, the Pocket LAN Adapter's could only work with Ethernet; thatshortcoming was amended with its Arcnet and Token Ring versions.andM;The Pocket Arcnet Adapter connects laptops to Arcnet running over coax ortwisted pair.andP;  Whn it ships in January, it will cost $395.andP;  Both the PocketArcnet Adapter and Pocket Token Ring Adapter work with NetWare, and thePocket Roken Ring Adapter works with IBM PC LAN Program.andP;  Shielded andunshielded twisted-pair versions of Token Ring are priced at $895, it isscheduled to ship by December 1989, subject to chip availability.andM;Speedy X.25.andP;  As networks grow and demand interconnection, more bandwidth isnecessary.andP;  X.25 is one method of connecting geographically remote networks.andO;X.25 is a favorite of companies that need to connect a large number ofoffices to a central location.andP;  Gateway Communications (Irvine, Calif.) wasone of the few WAN companies at Comdex to debut its high-speed X.25 gateway,G/X25 Gateway 64.andP;  LAN users can now have a 64K-bits-per-second link througha public data network, such as Tymnet or Telenet.andM;G/X25 Gateway 64 fits into any AT or EISA bus machine on a NetWare or NetBIOSLAN.andP;  Its WNIM 186 adapter has a 186 chip and firmware for protocolprocessing, thereby offloading all communications functions from the PC inwhich it is installed.andP;  This allows the gateway PC to be used for otherfunctions.andM;Gateway offers 27 terminal emulators, instead of the usual one or two mostgateway companies offer.andP;  G/X25 Gateway 64 supports 256 virtual sessions.andO;Each LAN user may have up to four simultaneous sessions.andP;  Up to three G/X25gateways can be installed in the gateway PC.andP;  G/25 Gateway 64 costs $3,445.andM;Diskless wonderS.andP;  Earth and Esprit showed their new 16MHz, 80386SX disklessPCs.andP;  Their products, although they achieve similar functions, have taken adifferent approach.andP;  Earth Computer (Fountain Valley, Calif.) encloses thediskless PC completely within a keyboard.andP;  All the user adds is the monitor.andO;Esprit Systems (San Jose, Calif.) puts its diskless PC in the base of themonitor.andM;The EarthStation-III supports Arcnet, Ethernet, and Token Ring via aremovable LAN protocol module on the motherboard.andP;  VGA, EGA, CGA, andHercules graphics are standard, also on the motherboard.andP;  While 1MB of RAM isstandard, it can be expanded up to 4MB.andP;  Two serial ports and one parallelport is standard.andM;The LAMTerm 3 is larger than Esprit's other diskless PCs, but it is still asleek design.andP;  The LANTerm 3 works on Arcnet or Ethernet networks.andP;  TheEsprit machine is unusual in that it has built in DEC VT-100 terminalemulation.andP;  Users may hot-key between a LAN and a host session.andP;  VGA and EGAdisplays are supported.andP;  The LANTerm 3 operates with zero wait states andcomes standard with 1MB of RAM.andP;  It can be expanded to up to 8MB on themotherboard.andP;  Like the Earth diskless, the Esprit can be configured from thekeyboard.andP;  In addition to the 386SX, the LANTerm 3 supports a 12 or 16MHz80387 math coprocessor.andM;Keeping your PCs from walking.andP;  Do you lie away at night fearing for thecompany's PCs, hard drives, RAM chips, or modems?andP;  If your PCs hadAlarmCards, you could sleep soundly.andP;  AlarmCard is a burglar alarm for PCs.andO;Drop it into a PC's slot, and if any person moves that PC or tries to accessits keyboard without authorization, 85 decibel siren will shatter thesilence.andP;  If an 85 decibels is too quiet, a 120 decibel external siren isavailable.andM;Two types of people can access an AlarmCard-protected PC.andP;  Passwords can beestablished for users so that they may access certain software and data.andP;  ThePC security person can set up to four passwords for each PC, so four peoplecan use the same PC without sacrificing security.andP;  The second type of accesspermits a person who knows the password to move the computer or open thecase.andM;Many companies want to tie AlarmCard into their company's security system; awireless connection is possible to a security system, auto-dialer, cable TV,or guard station.andP;  AlarmCard, by the Bellevue, Wash., company of the samename, is $149.andM;Technical ExcellenceandM;Novell's NetWare 386 3.0 beat out products from XcelleNet and SynOpticsCommunications to win PC Magazine's 1989 Connectivity Award for TechnicalExcellence, the Ziff-Davis publication announced at Comdex.andM;In the connectivity category, Netware 386, released by Novell last spring,was selected over SynOptics' LattisNet Network Management System andXcelleNet's XcellNet.andP;  OS/2 won the award for Technical Excellence in theoperating environment, Compaq president Rod Canion was named 1989's Person ofthe Year, and the Pouquet PC from Poquet Computer won in the portable PCsdivision.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
