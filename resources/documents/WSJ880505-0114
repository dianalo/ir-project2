Lord Young, Britain's trade and industry secretary, yesterday asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to report within four months on what, if anything, the government should do about the Kuwaiti stake.    Analysts predicted the British probably would decide to block further Kuwaiti investment in BP and obtain binding promises that Kuwait won't seek a management role. That would reassure BP and United Kingdom officials, who worry that even a passive Kuwaiti holding could jeopardize the future of Britain's biggest company.    &quot;We think the likely outcome, and the government's desire, is that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission require various assurances in return for letting them keep the stake,&quot; said Jeremy Elden, an analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew.    The monopolies panel's task is unusually delicate. The commission, which typically rules on takeovers that raise explicit antitrust problems, faces vague public-interest concerns in this case. BP holds huge oil and natural-gas reserves in the North Sea and is the U.S.'s largest oil producer. Lord Young said Kuwait's oil interests and membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries warranted the investigation. He didn't elaborate.    BP has expressed worries that the Kuwaiti stake could harm its relations with the U.S. and other countries or wind up in the hands of less-friendly investors. But BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said the company didn't initiate the inquiry, although it has answered &quot;technical and factual questions&quot; and would cooperate.    Kuwait is one of the world's biggest investors, with holdings estimated at $85 billion. The Kuwait Investment Office in London, which manages the country's investments, said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; about the probe and will argue &quot;vigorously&quot; that its BP holding isn't inimical to Britain. &quot;The KIO considers it has always acted as a model investor in BP and that its presence as a shareholder in BP is not in any way contrary to the British public interest,&quot; the office said.    The U.K. usually asks involved parties to refrain from share purchases during such reviews. The government didn't say whether it asked Kuwait to cease its purchases. But analysts said further purchases now would only hurt Kuwait's case before the commission. The KIO hasn't boosted its holding since March.    Analysts expect the review will hold down BP's share price by removing the likelihood of Kuwaiti purchases. BP shares were quoted late yesterday on London's stock exchange at 266 pence ($4.96), down six pence. Partly paid shares were quoted at 72 pence, down four pence.    Late last year, Kuwait effectively rescued the British government. To salvage its #7.24 billion ($13.5 billion) offer of BP shares after October's stock-market crash, Britain said it would buy back unwanted BP shares. The Kuwaitis, apparently seeing the new BP shares as a chance to expand their portfolio, snapped up most of the shares. Their purchases relieved Britain of both expense and embarrassment.    Concern grew about Kuwait's influence over the oil giant as Kuwait continued to buy BP shares. The KIO in March announced a small increase in its stake, to 22%, and pledged to hold the stake to a maximum of 22.5%. Kuwaiti officials also repeated assurances that the BP holding was purely an investment and said they didn't want a board or management role. </TEXT></DOC>
