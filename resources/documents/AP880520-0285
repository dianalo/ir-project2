(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There is something so sad about the rows ofgraves freshly cut into the bright green grass.   Something so wrong about magnolias coming alive in these days ofmourning. Spring is a time of rebirth and renewal.   A week ago, the children of Radcliff were planning theirsummers, playing ball, practicing the trumpet. But these have beenseven days of sorrow. Each day, tears. And one question with noanswer: Why?   Most of the children, many of them classmates, were buried inthe warming soil this past week, seven days after their church buswas hit head-on by a pickup truck heading the wrong way on theinterstate highway.   The pickup driver, who police said was drunk, has been chargedwith 27 counts of murder _ one for each of 24 children and threeadults.   It was one of the nation's worst bus crashes and every parent'sworst nightmare. In this Army town, next to Fort Knox, these havebeen seven days in which faith has been tested, dreams destroyedand pain endured.   ``The shock really hasn't worn off,'' said the Rev. DanMattingly of the First Assembly of God, which lost 13 members.``It's going to take a long, long time to heal the hurt.''</TEXT><TEXT>   It began as a journey home, the end of a day's outing at KingsIsland amusement park near Cincinnati.   It ended in the still of the night May 14 on Interstate 71.   At 10:55 p.m., the bus was near Carrollton, 100 miles from home,heading south when it was rammed by the pickup, driven by LarryMahoney, traveling north on the wrong side of the road. Testsshowed his blood-alcohol level was 2{ times the legal limit.   The collision ruptured the bus gas tank, turning the front ofthe vehicle into a smoky fireball. Screaming, panicked childrenpiled on top of each other in their struggle to escape.   With 67 people inside, the front door blocked by flames and justone working door in back, dozens were trapped. Many were saved.Joshua Conyers, 14, died a hero _ pushing his critically burnedbrother, Aaron, 13, out a window.   ``He loved his family and his little brother,'' recalled MarthaTennison, wife of the pastor of the First Assembly of God.   By the time Trooper Jim Mudd arrived half an hour later,helicopters had ferried some of the injured to Louisville, about 50miles away.   ``There was quietness, somberness,'' he recalled. ``There wassmoke, the heavy stench of death from the remains.   ``Being a father and a parent,'' he said, ``it hurts so muchmore when you see young people, teen-agers, so many of them dead atone particular scene.''</TEXT><TEXT>   For the 27 dead, the trip home finally ended three days later ina procession of gray hearses from Carrollton, traveling the sameroute the bus would have taken. At the accident site, someone hassince placed a cross of pink plastic flowers.   The grim task of identification took two days. Dental recordswere used for most, clothing, shoes and jewelry for others.   Most bodies were taken to the Radcliff area; others went toMissouri, Florida, Colorado and Tennessee.   It took nearly four hours for all the hearses to leave.Departures were staggered to ease the pain.   ``The idea of seeing a bunch of hearses in front of the funeralhome ... we thought would be devastating to the community,'' saidAaron Smith, a Lexington funeral director who helped out.   ``I cannot identify with those families,'' he said softly. ``Ihave not lost a child. It is normal for them to start thinkingabout their children burying them in 40 or 50 years. They aresuddenly having to bury their own children. ... How can anybodydeal with it?''</TEXT><TEXT>   Talking. Day and night, people have met at churches, schools andFort Knox, where a 24-hour crisis phone line was set up.   Seventeen of those killed had some link to the Army post. Asergeant lost his entire family: his wife _ a childhood sweetheart_ and his two daughters.   ``If you're in the Army, the job is to do a soldier's work,''said Maj. John Eagles, a spokesman. ``That might include gettingkilled. (But) the children have been killed. Everything you'vetrained for _ all that is out the window.''   Every day people ask why _ a question with no answer.   `They're confused,'' said the Rev. Danny Glover, who counseledstudents at one middle school. ``They want to know why God let thathappen.''   There is anger, too, he said. ``At the same time, that anger ismixed with a feeling of pity for the driver _ human justice willnever be able to do anything worse than having him (live) with thememory of what happened.''</TEXT><TEXT>   They are now names and faces in the newspapers. A week ago, theywere sons and daughters, husbands and wives, leading quiet lives.Each has a story.   Robin Williams, 10, whose sister and mother were also killed,played her first softball game last week.   Phillip Lee Morgan, 13, a drummer, was to play in his firstconcert Monday.   Shannon Rae Fair, 14, was baptized on Easter last month.   And Jennifer Ann Arnett, 13, ``just wanted everybody to behappy,'' said Mrs. Tennison. ``She didn't want anybody to be hurt.And she loved to play her trumpet.''   And then there's John Pearman, the bus driver who died trying tosave his passengers. His 14-year-old daughter was criticallyinjured.   Neighbors remember Pearman from the child they held in theirarms to the man who grew to be a soldier in Vietnam, Hardin circuitcourt clerk, member of the Radcliff City Council. Last month, hewas ordained as a minister at the First Assembly of God.   John loved children, attended softball games with his girls and``wouldn't have left that bus with one person on it,'' said hisuncle, state Sen. Virgil Pearman.   Ironically, he said, John was always the one who consoledmourners. ``He always had the right words to say and was always theperson who took over.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Praying. All week, mourners have come to the Assembly of God,where scores of arrangements of roses, lilies and chrysanthemumsfrom across the nation are lined up at the altar.   The church has received nearly 1,000 letters, some from youngchildren expressing their condolences.   Folks here hold fast to their religion. ``This is a time youhave to draw on your faith,'' said Betty Durrance, whose16-year-old son escaped the bus.   Mrs. Tennison's son also got out safely. ``Someone pushed himout of the back door,'' she said. ``I'd rather say he's blessedthan lucky. God just blessed us.''   This week, the funerals will be over. The anguish will remain.   ``The worst is yet to come,'' said Pearman. ``As families try toget back to their ordinary lives, there's not going to be thosefriends and that support. They will get over it. Time's the onlything that heals the wounds.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 22</NOTE></DOC>
