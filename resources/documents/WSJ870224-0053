Gephardt AnnouncesPresidential Campaign, Cites Trade Issue---By Dennis FarneyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> ST. LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Richard A. Gephardt formally launched his campaign for president -- by running against Japan, South Korea and other U.S. trading partners.    Tough talk on trade was the centerpiece as the south St. Louis congressman began his bid before a flag-waving crowd here. Mr. Gephardt, the first Democrat to declare his candidacy officially, complained the U.S. is exporting industries and jobs -- &quot;selling our children's future for a fistful of marks and yen.&quot;    As sunlight streamed through the glassed-in roof of newly restored Union Station, he continued:    &quot;The real answer is not to drive the dollar down endlessly. . . . And the answer is not to rely on the untender mercies of our trading partners. . . . The next president must be as tough in negotiating the terms of trade as this president has been in negotiating with the Russians.    &quot;I know this position won't be popular with everyone. But people sitting in cushy offices, in secure jobs, have no right to tell workers on assembly lines that their hopes and livelihood have to be sacrificed on an altar of a false and rigid free-trade ideology.&quot;    Then he flew on to a campaign stop in Iowa, his 25th visit in 26 months to that state, which -- as it customarily does -- will hold the presidential campaign's first caucus.    &quot;Let me reassure the farmers of Iowa,&quot; he said at a Des Moines airport rally. &quot;The problems you are having . . . are the fault of the government that runs this country today.&quot; As congressman, Rep. Gephardt is backing a new farm bill that would sharply cut grain production while boosting the government's guaranteed loan price to farmers. Critics of the bill say it would hurt U.S. grain exports.    As a campaign theme, Rep. Gephardt's trade philosophy is likely to become a target as well as a weapon. Critics have assailed similar statements by the lawmaker during his 11 years in the House as &quot;protectionism&quot; that could backfire on export-dependent U.S. manufacturers and farmers. But Mr. Gephardt coupled such statements yesterday with pledges to help modernize industry and shore up depressed farmers.    The 46-year-old candidate, a cautious centrist, wears the earnest, well-scrubbed look of a student body president grown older.    As congressman, Mr. Gephardt also has opposed Ronald Reagan's &quot;Star Wars&quot; defense plan, but also Jimmy Carter's hospital cost-containment proposal. He's close to organized labor, but retains ties to conservative Southern Democrats.    With Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), he championed deep cuts in tax rates and the elimination of many deductions about two years before President Reagan made the idea his own.    He strongly opposes abortion, unusual for a national Democratic candidate. But in a concession to &quot;pro-choice&quot; activists within the party, he has dropped his support for a constitutional amendment prohibiting it.    Mr. Gephardt's strong suit is his capacity for work and organization. The big question about him is whether he can excite voters on the stump. Seemingly anticipating this problem yesterday, he delivered lines that echoed John F. Kennedy.    &quot;It's time to ask again what we can do for each other -- and not just what we can do for ourselves,&quot; he said here. &quot;. . . I want to see America on the move again.&quot;    He seasoned his speech with jabs at the Reagan administration and the spreading Iran-Contra scandal. &quot;If Congress outlaws military aid to the Contras, the duty of the executive branch is to carry out the law, not to figure out how to bend and break it covertly,&quot; he said to strong applause.    Rep. Gephardt is keying much of his strategy to next February's Iowa caucus, where he hopes to break out of the pack of contenders and establish himself as a serious candidate. Undaunted by the difficulty of running for president from the narrow base of a congressman, he brought a score of current and past congressional colleagues to hear his declaration.    &quot;I think he'd make a hell of a president,&quot; said one fellow lawmaker, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), to the crowd of 5,000. </TEXT></DOC>
