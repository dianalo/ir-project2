It's nice to see something written about a roll-up-your-sleeves individual entrepreneur, as opposed to ivory-tower corporate &quot;gray masses.&quot;    Having once served in New York City government as deputy administrator of the Economic Development Administration, I must say that there is a great deal to be said for Mr. LeFrak's position about building in New York. Contrary to what the mayor says, I don't think Mr. LeFrak wants a special law, but rather is simply asking what I think many developers are asking -- for a sensible and intelligent approach by city government to development, instead of an adversarial and obstructive bureaucratic nightmare.
