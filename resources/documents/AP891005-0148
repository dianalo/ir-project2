He also said it would mean the ``serious and legitimate concernsregarding care and support of our senior citizens will lose Cabinetlevel advocacy.''   Social Security is now part of the Department of Health andHuman Services.   Supporters of the proposals in Congress say that making SocialSecurity an independent federal agency would give Social Securityincreased visibility and would protect its trust funds from beingtapped for other uses.   Measures to make Social Security independent of HHS are in thebudget reconciliation bill passed by the House on Thursday and inthe Senate's reconciliation bill that will be acted on soon.   ``If the system ain't broke don't fix it,'' Sullivan said, ``andwe maintain that the system (Social Security) is working betterthan ever.''</TEXT></DOC>
