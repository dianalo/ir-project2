When the distributionof radiatively participating species is known in either a normal distributionor an exponential distribution in any direction of cylindrical coordinateswith respect to a referenced location, e.g. in a form, F = f exp (-arho-b phi/sup 2/-cz/sup 2/), where f, a, b, and c are distribution constantsfor individual species, the governing equation of radiation heat transferwithout scattering in such a system can be solved with relative easeby using the herein reported method. Several results from the presentauthors' work are explained that are employed for implementing the solution:a new coordinate transformation method to find the species distributionalong individual optical paths centered at any chosen location in thecombustor; a new formula for the aciabatic flame temperature in a logarithmicfunction expressed in terms of relevant variables; a new integral functionfacilitating solutions for various radiation equations; a new inverseerror function enabling some exact solution of the governing equationof radiation hat transfer, etc.</TEXT></DOC>
