Violet Holmes should know. She's the woman who supervises thedomino-like descent of 36 Rockettes in ``The Parade of the WoodenSoldiers,'' one of the most popular production numbers at Radio CityMusic Hall's annual Christmas show.   ``It's very difficult,'' says Holmes, a former Rockette who nowdirects the high-kicking dance line at New York's famous art decoentertainment palace. ``You can't just bend and get yourself up instiff, starched pants. The girls turn around and help each otherup.''   The five-minute dance is a precision military march done by theRockettes dressed as toy wooden soldiers. It ends with a cannon shot_ a puff of smoke that knocks over the line of dancers. They fall,one by one, on top of each other. And the audience cheers.   ``The fall has to be done just right,'' Holmes says. ``You haveto hold the girl in front of you, bringing her to you. As she fallsback, you have to fall back to the girl behind you. You have to makesure your legs are straight and that your arms are open, so that thegirl behind you, catches you. If they don't, the whole thing willslide right down.''   The march was choreographed originally by Russell Markert whofounded the Rockettes in 1932 when Radio City opened.   Markert had formed other high-kicking, precision kick lines. Hestarted with the St. Louis Rockets in 1925, moved them to New Yorkfor a part in the 1928 musical hit ``Rain or Shine,'' and then tothe Roxy Theater where they were know as the Roxyettes. It was atthe Roxy that Markert first choreographed ``The Parade of the WoodenSoldiers.''   Radio City beckoned four years later, and the line, with the nameRockettes, has been there ever since. So have those wooden soldiers,with Holmes supervising the march every year. It's one of thehighlights of the Christmas show which will be on view through Jan.4.   How do you teach someone to fall?   ``Slooow-ly,'' says Holmes. She usually begins by teaching it insections of 10 or 12 dancers lined up in a row. The others watch,and they all get pointers from dancers who have done the numberbefore.   ``A march of any kind is very difficult to teach,'' Holmes says.``The lines have to be perfect because it's so obvious if one girlsticks out. It's the guiding and keeping straight lines and walkingwith straight knees, not bent knees, in stiff, starched pants.''   Sometimes, the line has dancers who think that if they hold thefall a little bit, it's going to help the weight,'' Holmes adds. Itdoesn't.   If the fall starts and the line is crooked, there's nothing adancer can do to correct it. ``It's like you're in midair,'' Holmessays.   There have been injuries over the years, although none serious,the director says. ``If properly done, the number is notdangerous,'' she adds.   The first girl who falls has the easiest job. It's the lastdancer who has it tough, even though she collapses on a big, fatpillow.   ``She's waiting and looking at these 36 girls coming at her,''Holmes says. ``That's frightening. And you don't know how fast thefall is going to come. It can come very easily or like a whip.''   The fall is supposed to go easily, smoothly and slowly.   ``You are not supposed to look out and down because that wouldthrow the line crooked. They should only look at the girl's headright in front of them,'' she says. ``So you anticipate, but youdon't know what you're anticipating because you can't see anything.''   The parade has been modified slightly over the years. At someChristmas shows, the soldiers came down a ramp from a castle or outof sentry boxes. Today, the Rockettes just march out from the wingsof the large stage. Still, what audiences see at Radio City is muchof the original version, according to Holmes, although she has cutit by two minutes to fit more smoothly into the Hall's current90-minute Christmas extravaganza.   The director has her own charts and notes to guide her throughthe restaging. But she doesn't need them.   ``After all these years, you know it by heart,'' she says. ``Youdon't have to consult your notes anymore. Besides, I've tried tokeep it the same. Why change anything that is so successful?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
