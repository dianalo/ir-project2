Imaging was carried out in 26 patientswith suspected Alzheimer's disease, 14 with dementia of the frontal-lobetype, and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy. Images were evaluatedand reported without knowledge of clinical diagnosis with respect toregions of reduced uptake of tracer. Reduced uptake in the posteriorcerebral hemispheres was characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, whileselective anterior hemisphere abnormalities characterized both dementiaof the frontal-lobe type and progressive supranuclear palsy. The latterconditions could be distinguished on the basis of the appearance of integrityof the rim of the frontal cortex. The technique has an important rolein the differentiation of degenerative dementias.</TEXT></DOC>
