The account carried by Tehran's official Islamic Republic NewsAgency evidently referred to the incident Saturday night reportedearlier by U.S. officials.   They said American helicopters took ``evasive action'' whenfired on from an oil platform and several small boats in thecentral gulf about midnight Saturday.   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said there was no connection betweenthe helicopter incident and the movement of six U.S. warships upthe gulf today.   The ships' appearance off Dubai triggered speculation that theUnited States was planning to retaliate for the shooting Saturday.   All six, including a missile cruiser, three missile frigates, acombat stores ship and a chartered Navy tanker, were part of``routine movement, not connected with any other recent events inthe gulf,'' said Lt. Col. John Head, a spokesman for the U.S.Central Command.   Saturday's helicopter incident occurred as the aircraft werescouting ahead of the missile frigate Simpson, returning up thegulf after a convoy escort mission.   A U.S. statement said the helicopters took evasive action anddid not return fire when the Iranians shot at them.   It did not say what kind of helicopters were involved or howmany there were. Nor did the statement mention any warning by theIranians before they started shooting.   The platform was not identified by name or exact location,although the statement said it was not the Rostam platform. Rostamwas shelled by U.S. destroyers last October in a retaliatory raidafter an Iranian Silkworm missile hit a U.S. flagged Kuwaititanker, the Sea Isle City, anchored off Kuwait.   The Iranian account said: ``Two U.S. helicopters attempting toapproach an Iranian zone in the Persian Gulf early Sunday wereforced to flee by the anti-aircraft fire of naval forces of theIslamic Republic of Iran.''   It added: ``The navy anti-aircraft (unit) detected the twohelicopters on its radar and warned them to stay out of the Iranianzone. However, the Iranian navy fired warning shots after the U.S.helicopters violated the Iranian zone.''   Shortly after midnight Friday, U.S. officials said the missilefrigate John A. Moore fired at what were believed to be Iranianspeedboats seen on the radar screen before they disappeared.   Also Sunday, thousands of Iranians marched through centralTehran to the Soviet Embassy, claiming Moscow had supplied Iraqwith long-range missiles, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency saidin a report monitored in Nicosia.   IRNA said a number of students entered the embassy grounds byscaling a wall, but were thrown out by ``alert policemen.'' Iransaid it first learned about Iraq's new missiles seven months agoand had warned the Soviets that any use of the rockets would harmrelations between Tehran and Moscow, IRNA said.   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said a mob besieged theembassy, pelted it with rocks and tried to set fires, threateningthe lives of Soviet diplomats and their families. Similar ``hostileactions'' were directed Sunday at the Soviet Consulate in Isfahan,Iran, Tass said without elaborating.   Tass said the Soviet leadership ``rejects any allegations aboutthe Soviet Union's involvement in the missile attacks againstTehran.''   In the so-called ``war of the cities,'' Iran's official IslamicRepublic News Agency said 12 civilians, including women andchildren, were killed and 30 wounded when an Iraqi missile explodedin Tehran today. It said a clinic, several houses and 30 vehicleswere destroyed in the blast. The missile was one of two Iraq saidits army lobbed into Tehran early today.   IRNA said another 61 civilians were killed and 427 woundedSunday in Iraqi air raids on 16 Iranian cities and towns.   It reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired a missile ata ``military center'' in Baghdad around midnight. The officialIraqi News Agency said the missile exploded in a residential areaof the capital, killing and wounding ``a number of civilians,including women and children.''</TEXT></DOC>
