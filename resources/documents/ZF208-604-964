(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Poo, Gee-Swee; Ang, Wilson.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A driver program has been designed and developed to operate on thedata link layer of the IBM token ring Personal Computer adapter.andO;The program is written in the PC assembly language.andP;  It supportsthe Logical Link Control type 1 procedure, and serves as a basicbuilding block for the construction of higher level communicationssoftware.andP;  The design provides a mechanism by which to constructmultiple Service Access Points and multiple Command Control Blocksfor a SAP so that it can support the transmission of multipleframes without having to wait for the command completion of theearlier request.andP;  As a result, main memory processing in the PCcan continue in parallel while the adapter is preparing a framefor transmission, or awaiting its return.andP;  This overlapping inprocessing greatly enhances the efficiency of transmission, andreduces the link level processing overhead to a minimum.andP;  This isconfirmed by performance tests undertaken on the PC adapter.andO;(Reprinted by permission of the publisher.)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
