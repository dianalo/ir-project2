Koch regrettablyplaces himself with those who want to defeat necessary andreasonable legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Thislegislation would restore to Americans, be they women, racialand ethnic minorities, the elderly or the disabled -- thatis, you, your family members or friends --equal-employment-opportunity rights lost in the U.S. SupremeCourt's 1989 decisions.   Mr. Koch is wrong in saying that the Civil Rights Act hasanything to do with quotas. No one has produced any evidencethat the original interpretation of the civil-rights lawsthat the act is designed to restore ever led employers toimpose quotas. This legislation has to do with remedyingdiscrimination by allowing meritorious cases to proceed totrial.</LP><TEXT>   Look at the facts: The Civil Rights Act would reinstate astandard that had been in place nearly two decades. Thisstandard, that a business practice with &quot;disparate impact&quot;must have a &quot;significant relationship to successfulperformance of the job,&quot; was the touchstone of the 1971Griggs decision and any number of cases that followed,without any quotas resulting. It is a mystery why Mr. Kochwould think that this is not an appropriate standard. Equallymysterious is his contention that to avoid potentialliabilities, employers would resort to quota hiring. Again,such an action did not occur in the past and would, in anycase, be illegal.   Contrary to Mr. Koch's allegations, under the new billdisparate impact will continue to be a difficult standard forclaimants to prove. He disregards fact when he argues notonly that disparate impact will somehow be easier to proveunder the new bill, but that because of the bill's supposedlessened standard, employers will start keeping statisticsbased on employees' religions. Religious employmentdiscrimination always was prohibited by the civil-rights lawsand thus was covered by the reasoning in Griggs. Yet at notime did Griggs ever lead to the keeping of such statistics.Also wrong is Mr. Koch's allegation that the bill'sprovisions would pressure employers to hire lesser-qualifiedindividuals. The standard under Griggs, and affirmed in theCivil Rights Act, has to do with forbidding the use of jobtests and other selection criteria that, although neutral ontheir face, have a substantial disparate impact on otherwisequalified minorities and women, unless an employer shows thatthe practice was required by &quot;business necessity.&quot;   Mr. Koch implies that, because of the Civil Rights Act of1991, the workplace would have to reflect statistically thegeneral population. This is untrue, as evidenced by thebill's provision that a &quot;mere statistical imbalance in anemployer's workforce . . . is not alone sufficient toestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation.&quot;He then brings in an irrelevancy by criticizingaffirmative-action programs. Whatever their merits,affirmative-action programs have nothing to do with the CivilRights Act. This bill has nothing to do withaffirmative-action programs, but does include a crucialcivil-rights remedy: the expansion of a current provision ofcivil-rights law so that women and religious minorities, inaddition to racial minorities, would receive damages forintentional, malicious discrimination. Current law allowswomen and religious minorities to receive only back pay andreinstatement. (Would you want to return to a job where youhad been egregiously discriminated against?) The absence ofsuch damages in effect gives a free shot at violating thelaw. Experience under a related provision, which allowscompensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentionalracial discrimination, shows that there has not been anonslaught of cases.   Particularly disturbing is Mr. Koch's &quot;suggestion&quot; toJewish groups that they ought to be opposing this legislationin their own self-interest. American Jews have longunderstood that their rights will be protected fully only ina society that ardently protects the civil rights of all.That is why we overwhelmingly support the Civil Rights Act of1991.
