The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Matthew A. Evangelista, 6/8/88; HFA-0311</T3>Matthew A. Evangelista filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Director,DOE Office of Classification, of a request for information submitted underthe Freedom of Information Act. On review, the OHA adopted the determinationof the Office of Policy and Program Operations that some of the informationpreviously withheld under Exemption 1 (national security) should now bereleased to Evangelista because the withheld material has been determinedto be unclassified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Motion for Discovery</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Economoc Regulatory Administration, 6/10/88; KRD-0032, KRZ-0032</T3>The Economic Regulatory Administratin (ERA) filed a Motion for Discoveryand a Motion to Amend the Record relating to a Proposed Remedial Order(PRO) which the ERA issued to Gear Petroluem Company, Inc. (Gear Petroleum).In the PRO, the ERA seeks to recover overcharges in the sale of crude oilby Gear Petroleum because of the alleged misapplication of the ``NewlyDiscovered Crude Oil Price Rule.'' In the Motion for Discovery, the ERAsought information concerning a drill stem test performed at a well drilledby Gear Petroleum at its Finnup A-1 property in late 1978. In the Motionto Amend the Record, the ERA sought to substitute affidavits concerningwell testing activities at Finnup A-1.In considering the Motion for Discovery, the Office of Hearings and Appeals(OHA) determined that, as generally required by the discovery regulations,the ERA could have filed its requested discovery at the time it filed itsResponse to Gear Petroleum's Statement of Objections. For this reason,OHA denied the discovery as being untimely. OHA also found that the ERA'srequested discovery would unduly delay the proceeding because it couldhave obtained the information it sought during the evidentiary hearinggranted in <T3>Gear Petroleum Co., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 84,016 (1986). OHA stated, however,that if the evidentiary hearing did not resolve the factual issues raisedby the ERA's discovery, OHA would allow the ERA to renew its motion ormay grant the discovery <T3>sua sponte.</T3>In considering the Motion to Amend the Record, OHA found that the new affidavitonly highlighted information already in the record and applied the affiant'sexpert knowledge to those facts. In addition, OHA found there would beno prejudice to Gear Petroleum in accepting the new affidavit. Therefore,the affidavit substitution was allowed. Because of this substitution, OHAallowed Gear Petroleum to cross-examine the affiant at the evidentiaryhearing and to submit a list of witnesses to address the factual issuesdiscussed in the new affidavit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A. Inc./Saber Petroleum Marketing Company, et al., 6/6/88;RR139-1, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning nine Motions for Reconsiderationfiled by firms that were denied refunds under the spot purchaser presumptionin the Aminoil U.S.A., Inc. special refund proceeding. In considering thefirms' motions, the DOE found that during the prior proceeding each applicantfirm had been given a specific opportunity to submit material to rebutthe spot purchaser presumption before the initial Decision and Order wasissued, but had failed to do so. Moreover, the DOE found that the firmswere represented by an experienced attorney and, therefore, cannot be excusedfor their failure to respond to the DOE's requests for additional information.Therefore, the DOE determined that the firms' Motions for Reconsiderationbe denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>City of Bluffton Utilities, et al., 6/7/88; RF272-9619, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds for 10 applicants based on their respective purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27,1981. Each applicant used the products for various activities, and eachdetermined its claim either by consulting actual purchase records or bya reasonable method of estimation. Each applicant was an end-user of theproducts it claimed and was therefore presumed injured. The sum of therefunds granted in this Decision is $2,004. All of the claimants will beeligible for additional refunds as additional crude oil overcharge fundsbecome available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Delmar Rigdon et al., 6/10/88; RF272-6337 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds for 74 applicants based on their respective purchases of refinedpetroleum products during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27,1981. Each applicant used the products for various agricultural activities,and each determined its claim either by consulting actual purchase recordsor by estimating its consumption based on the acres it farmed. Each applicantwas an end-user of the petroleum products it claimed and was thereforepresumed injured. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $2,293.All of the claimants will be eligible for additional crude oil overchargefunds become available.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dorchester Gas Corp./Rash Oil Company, 6/10/88; RF253-49</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundin the Dorchester Gas Corporation refund proceeding. Rash Oil Company (Rash)was an indirect purchaser of Dorchester covered products during the consentorder period. Rash purchased propane from Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips)and gasoline from Cimarron Valley, Inc. (Cimarron). Both Phillips and Cimarronwere direct purchasers of Dorchester product and both received a refundin the Dorchester refund proceeding. Rash was eligible for 79.5642 percentof its allocable share for its propane purchases because the DOE had previouslydetermined that this was the amount available for distribution to Phillips'downstream customers. Rash was eligible for the full volumetric refundamount for its indirect purchases of gasoline because the direct purchaser,Cimarron, elected to limit its refund to the small claims threshold. BecauseCimarron was not required to submit proof of injury, the DOE found it mostequitable to presume that Rash was overcharged in its gasoline purchasesby the full volumetric amount. Rash's allocable share for its propane purchaseswas $5,331, and its allocable share for its gasoline purchases was $4,316.However, since Rash elected to limit its refund to the established $5,000threshold amount, the firm was not required to submit a detailed proofof injury. The total amount of the refund involved in this Decision is$6,878, representing $5,000 in principal and $1,878 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Herbert H. Moore, Edward Pagel, 6/10/88; RF272-2433, RF272-2481</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting two Applications for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds. The two claimants were farmers who usedsales receipts to determine the number of gallons of petroleum productsthey used during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Whencalculating the amount of grease used during this period, however, eachApplicant used pounds rather than gallons as the standard measure. Accordingly,the DOE converted the pounds of grease to gallons and added this convertedfigure of each Applicant's gallonage. Each applicant was an end-user ofthe products it claimed and was therefore presumed injured. The sum ofthe refunds granted in this Decision is $49. Both claimants will be eligiblefor additional refunds as additional crude oil overcharge funds becomeavailable.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Howard Oil Co., Inc./Bayside Fuel Oil Depot Corp., 6/10/88; RF286-5</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting in part an Application forRefund filed by Bayside Fuel Oil Depot Crop. in the Howard Oil Co., Inc.special refund proceeding. Bayside's documented purchase volumes were sufficientto qualify the firm for a refund greater than the $5,000 small claims threshold,but the firm elected to limit this claim to $5,000 in lieu of making adetailed showing of injury. Accordingly, Bayside received a total refundof $6,278, representing $5,000 in principal and $1,278 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc. et al., 6/10/88; RF272-5155 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 10 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant used the products for various business related activities, andeach determined its claim either by consulting actual purchase recordsor by estimating its consumption. The DOE determined that each method ofestimation was acceptable for purposes of this refund proceeding. Eachapplicant was an end-user of the products it claimed and was thereforepresumed injured. The sum of the refunds granted in this Decision is $2,671.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Lewis Bros. Farms, et al., 6/8/88; RD272-1384, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting seven Applications for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds based on the Applicants' purchases of refinedpetroleum products from August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Eachapplicant estimated its petroleum purchases by multiplying the number ofacres it farmed and/or head of livestock it raised by the correspondingaverage annual petroleum product consumption rate among the nation's farmers,as estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The DOE determinedthat the Applicants should be presumed injured because each was an end-userof the gallons it claimed. The refunds granted in this Decision total $502.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./General Motors Corporation, 6/8/88; RF225-10008 etal.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom the Mobil Oil Corporation consent order fund filed by the GeneralMotors Corporation (GM). GM was an end-user of Mobil refined petroleumproducts during the Mobil consent order period, and presented evidenceto prove that it purchased its refined petroleum products directly formMobil. The firm had records showing its total expenditures for Mobil productsduring the consent order period, and, using Energy Information Agency (EIA)retail motor gasoline price per gallon figures, was able to estimate thetotal gallons purchased from Mobil. According to the methodology set forthin <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), GM was found tobe eligible for a refund from the Mobil consent order fund. However, thefirm's total estimate was reduced to account for: (i) Purchases of productsafter their respective dates of decontrol; (ii) incorrect EIA price pergallon figures; and (iii) ineligible volumes purchased prior to March 6,1973. Based on the volume of its purchases times 100 percent of the volumetricrefund amount, the DOE granted GM a refund of $58,803 ($47,183 principalplus $11,620 interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Hughes Oil Company, 6/10/88; RF225-8780</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom the Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by Hughes Oil Company,a reseller of Mobil refined petroleum products. In the Mobil proceeding,an applicant may choose to either rely on the presumptions set forth inMobil Oil Corp., 13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), or it may choose to submitdocumentation demonstrating that it was injured to a greater extent thanthe average reseller. Hughes elected to submit additional documentationin an effort to demonstrate injury. Applying the competitive disadvanatageanalysis to the data submitted by Hughes, the DOE determined that the firmpurchased its motor gasoline at prices higher than the average market prices.The DOE determined that Hughes was therefore eligible to receive the fullvolumetric refund amount for its purchases of Mobil motor gasoline. Accordingly,Hughes was granted a refund of $62,040, representing $49,781 in principaland $12,259 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Jerry O'Brien; Hawkins Cove Oil Corp., 6/10/88; RF225-6781,RF225-6778, RF225-6779</T3>Jerry O'Brien (O'Brien) and Hawkins Cove Oil Corp. (Hawkins) filed applicationsfor refund from the Mobil Corporation escrow account. The DOE determinedthat O'Brien and Hawkins were spot purchasers of Mobil products. O'Brienand Hawkins failed to rebut the presumption that they were not injuredas a result of their purchases. Accordingly, the firms' applications weredenied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Jim Traughber Oil Co., 6/8/88; RF225-9384, RF225-9385,RF225-9386, RF225-9387</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting in part an Application forRefund from the Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by Jim TraughberOil Co., a reseller of Mobil refined petroleum products. In the Mobil proceeding,applicants may choose to either rely on the presumption set forth in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985) (<T3>Mobil</T3>), or they may choose to submit documentation demonstratingthat they were injured to a greater extent than the average reseller. Inthe case of Traughber, the firm elected to submit additional documentationin an effort to rebut these presumptions and demonstrate injury. The DOE,however, did not accept the approximated banks of unrecouped increasedproduct costs submitted by Traughber as the first part of an injury showing.The DOE found that the May 1973 profit margin, based on the profit madeby the firm as a Mobil consignee, was not a suitable basis for the firm'sapproximated banks. In <T3>Mobil, </T3>however, applicants who are unable to rebut the presumptionsof injury and who did not conclusively demonstrate that they were injuredare eligible for a refund nonetheless. The DOE therefore reviewed the presentapplication and determined that all necessary information had been providedfor a refund under the level-of-distribution injury presumption. Accordingly,the Application for Refund was granted. The total amount approved in theDecision and Order was $5,124, representing $4,111 in principal plus $1,013in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Jim's Mobil, 6/8/88; RF225-7595</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom the Mobil Oil Corporation escrow account filed by Jim's Mobil, a retailerof Mobil refined petroleum products. Jim's elected to apply for a refundbased upon the presumption set forth in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). After determiningthat Jim's estimates of its purchases volumes accurately reflected itsactual purchases from Mobil, the DOE granted the firm a refund of $415,representing in principal plus $82 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Kahale Walid et al., 6/10/88; RF225-4209 et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting applications filed by sixpurchasers of Mobil refined petroleum products in the Mobil Oil Corp. specialrefund proceeding. According to the procedures set forth in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), each applicant wasfound to be eligible for a refund based on the volume of products it purchasedfrom Mobil. The total amount of refunds approved in this Decision was $10,959,representing $8,793 in principal plus $2,166 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Silver Oil Co., Inc. 6/8/88; RF225-8771</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by Silver Oil Co., Inc. in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refund proceeding.<T3>See Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). Silver, a retailerof refined petroleum products, attempted to rebut the level-of-distributioninjury presumption for its purchases of Mobil motor gasoline in order toreceive a full volumetric refund of $30,772. After examining the firm'scost banks and applying a three-part competitive disadvantage test, theDOE concluded that Silver should receive a refund of $20,529 on its motorgasoline purchases, representing $16,472 in principal and $4,057 in accruedinterest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>National Helium Corp./Ohio, 6/7/88; RF3-104, RQ3-452</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving the Motion for Modificationand second-stage refund application filed by the State of Ohio in the NationalHelium Corp. refund proceeding. Ohio will use an additional $40,981.62for the Furnace Retrofit Program, which helps low-income residents improvethe efficiency of their oil heating systems. The State will also add $41,875to the Energy Auditor Training Program, which trains auditors who willprovide free energy audits to low and moderate income residents. Ohio requestedan additional $511.59 for these programs; the rest will come from reducedfunding levels for a previously-approved program. The DOE found that theprograms will help injured consumers reduce their residential fuel consumption.Accordingly, Ohio's requests were approved.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Pyrofax Gas Corporation/Godwin Gas Company, 6/6/88; RF277-70</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Godwin Gas Company (Godwin) in the Pyrofax Gas Corporation specialrefund proceeding. Godwin submitted cost banks in excess of its refundclaim and market price comparison material in support of a refund of morethan $5,000. After examining Godwin's application and supporting documentation,the DOE concluded that the firm should receive a refund of $34,858, representing$18,531 in principal and $16,327 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Richardson Ayres Jobber, Inc./SOS Truck Stop, Inc., 6/9/88; RF281-1</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled on behalf of SOS Truck Stop, Inc. (SOS) in the Richardson Ayres Jobber,Inc. (Ayers) special refund proceeding. SOS applied for a refund basedon the procedures outlined in <T3>Richardson Ayres Jobber, Inc., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85-368 (1986), governingthe disbursement of settlement funds received from Ayres pursuant to aSeptember 29, 1981 Consent Order. Because SOS was a retailer that limitedits claim to $5,000, the firm was presumed to have been injured by Ayres'alleged overcharges. After examining the application and supporting documentationsubmitted by SOS, the DOE granted the firm a refund of $8,879, representing$5,000 in principal and $3,879 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Supradur Companies, Inc. 6/10/88; RF 272-3463</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfrom crude oil overcharge funds based on the Applicant's purchase of refinedpetroleum products from August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981. To estimateits total purchase volume, the Applicant extrapolated from actual figuresthat were available for four years of the price control period. The DOEdetermined that the Applicant should be presumed injured because it wasan end-user of the gallons claimed. The refund granted in this Decisionis $345.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Vickers Energy Corporation/Arkansas, 6/8/88; RQ1-456</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving a second-stage refund applicationsubmitted by the State of Arkansas in the Vickers Energy Corp. specialrefund proceeding. <T3>See Vickers Energy Corp., </T3>12 Doe andpara; 85,164 (1985). Since thepending Vickers litigation has been resolved, the DOE determined that theVickers funds previously granted to Arkansas could now be disbursed tothe State. Accordingly, the DOE granted Arkansas a total of $1,295 ($773in principal plus $522 in interest) for use in the energy conservationpromotion projects previously approved by the DOE.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Vickers Energy Corporation/Wisconsin 6/8/88; RQ1-454</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving a second-stage refund applicationsubmitted by the State of Wisconsin in the Vickers Energy Corp. specialrefund proceeding. <T3>See Vickers Energy Corp., </T3>12 Doe andpara; 85,164 (1985). Since thepending Vickers litigation has been resolved, the DOE determined that theVickers funds previously granted to Wisconsin could now be disbursed tothe State.
