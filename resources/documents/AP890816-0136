Instead, they foundthemselves debating whether blacks have a single political partythey can call home.   In a heated two-hour session, members of the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference agreed that blacks in America are coming to apolitical crossroads prompted by their wariness of Republicans andtheir dissatisfaction with Democrats.   But the SCLC leaders had few answers for voters who say theydon't think either party is sincerely interested in their concerns.   ``We don't have to sell our souls,'' said Eddie Williams of theJoint Center for Political Studies. ``But until (the RepublicanParty) has those kinds of individuals who look like us and talk likeus and are willing to stand up like us, the black electorate willnot follow Republicans.''   Blacks have been particularly reluctant to join the RepublicanParty because they view it as insensitive to civil rights issues.They also say the immediate past Republican administration, underPresident Ronald Reagan, sought to turn back the clock on civilrights progress made during the 1950s and 1960s.   The Republican Party recently has stepped up its efforts to courtblack voters, and the Bush administration has been in frequentcommunication with civil rights leaders, voicing support for theircause. Civil rights leaders say they are waiting for action,particularly after recent Supreme Court decisions againstaffirmative action and minority set-aside programs.   The SCLC, which is convening in Atlanta this week, has lent anoncommittal ear to the Republican Party's civil rights goals. SCLCPresident Joseph Lowery has met with Bush and invited Vice PresidentDan Quayle to open the convention.   Teresa Jeter, who identified herself as a black Republican, saidthe Democratic Party has failed to work for the roughly 90 percentof black voters it represents. She said she feared that could happenin either party.   ``I'm no blind fool,'' she said. ``How can we work within thesystem when it hasn't worked for us?''   U.S. Rep. Walter Fauntroy, a Democrat who represents the Districtof Columbia, said too much of the two-party system could diluteblack voting strength, ``given our numerical percentage.''   Portia Scott, co-chair of the National Black Republican Council,disagreed.   ``I'm appalled by one-party domination,'' she said. ``It isincumbent on everybody in this room to check out the RepublicanParty.''   ``I am not opposed to getting people out to vote Republican,''Fauntroy said. ``You in the Republican Party must have the courageto say to your party, `This is not a game.'''   Fauntroy said that party identification is not a key question forblack voters. ``The question will be: `When I was hungry, did youfeed me?''' he said.   ``I'm not here to say the Republicans have the answer,'' saidBill Chappell, chairman of the Georgia Black Republicans Council.``We as blacks should be cognizant of two-party politics. If it canwork for other people in the United States, it can certainly workfor us.''   Lee Atwater, Republican National Committee chairman, and RonaldBrown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, had beenscheduled to participate in the political session, but did notattend. Quayle spoke on Tuesday.   Emmanuel Cleaver, vice mayor of Kansas City, Mo., cautionedDemocrats not to assume blacks are satisfied with the party'streatment of their concerns.   ``We have been bludgeoned politically by Democrats,'' he said,adding that it will be ``infinitely easier'' for blacks to progressin both parties.   The SCLC convention, which runs through Friday, is being held inAtlanta for the first time since Lowery took over the leadership in1977.</TEXT></DOC>
