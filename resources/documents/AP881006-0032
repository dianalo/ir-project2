Republican and Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday inintroducing the legislation that they did not expect action on thebill before Congress adjourns next week.   The Reagan administration has said more study is needed beforetaking action to curb the greenhouse effect.   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., chief architect of the newproposal, said available options for reducing greenhouse gases suchas carbon dioxide can vary in cost by ten-fold or more.   ``This makes it imperative that the strategy the federalgovernment undertakes in formulating global warming preventionpolicies avoids imposing needless and wasteful expenditures ...,''she said.   The global warming trend, which some scientists say already hasbegun, could raise the average temperature of the earth by 3degrees to 8 degrees in the middle of the next century.   The warming comes about because gases arising from humanactivity build up in the atmosphere, trapping radiant heat thatnormally would escape to space. The most important gas, carbondioxide, comes from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil andcoal.   Also on Wednesday, a report from the Environmental and EnergyStudy Institute, a companion organization to the congressionalEnvironmental and Energy Study Conference, called for a `firstpriority'' on energy efficiency by the next administration.   The report said political leaders must be willing to raise theconsumer cost of using fuels that produce carbon dioxide. Aprominent example would be gasoline.   Ms. Schneider's measure calls for substantial increases in fundsfor research and development, modification of federal buildings tocreate 40 percent energy savings by the end of the century, toughefficiency standards for electric lights and major increases inauto fuel efficiency along with a higher ``gas-guzzler'' tax andrebates for buyers of efficient models.</TEXT></DOC>
