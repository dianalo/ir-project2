Trachtenberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/16/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1</SO><LP>   NEW YORK -- When it comes to fishing lures, Seth Rosenbaumhas a bigger appetite than most fish.   By his own reckoning, Mr. Rosenbaum, a computer consultantfrom New York City's borough of Queens, has accumulated about20,000 of the fish-fooling devices. Some resemble naturalbaits, such as minnows or mice. Others have been hammeredfrom metal into abstract serpentine curves. Lures by thethousands line the walls of his walk-in closet, while hispants and jackets hang in disarray on a rack in his bedroom.Still other lures spill over his kitchen counter or lie onthe floor in tangled jumbles of hooks and feathers.</LP><TEXT>   This Dennis-the-Menace mess, however, is worth a smallfortune. Although most lures don't yet bring the same pricesas Navaho rugs or Mission style furniture, one small metalfish lure called a Haskell Minnow sold for $20,350 two yearsago. More recently, Mr. Rosenbaum says he rejected a $4,000offer for a minnow-shaped &quot;Jersey Expert.&quot;   To the amusement of many sportsmen, old fishing lures arebecoming big business in the burgeoning collectibles field.There is a national lure club with more than 3,000 members,an auction house committed to building the market, and anever increasing number of new books available on the topic.There is even a National Fishing Tackle Museum in Arcadia,Okla., although it has yet to benefit from the craze. Infact, so few folks visit that the museum's owner is offeringit for sale for $1.2 million.   &quot;This is a fascinating hobby if you get bit by the bug,&quot;drawls Clyde Harbin, a collector who has narrated fourvideotapes aimed at the lure market. &quot;The only problem isthat you can't get enough of the good ones.&quot;   Nobody knows when lure manufacturing started in thiscountry, but Vermont fisherman Julio T. Buel received thefirst lure patent in 1852. Legend has it that Mr. Buelaccidentally dropped an ordinary spoon in the water, only towatch in awe as a nice-sized trout swallowed it. Thisbreakthrough in lure research enabled him to build asuccessful factory in Whitehall, N.Y., and his graceful metallures can be seen in a museum there.   Following Mr. Buel's lead, fishermen by the thousandsfiled patents for their own sure-fire fish catchers. ArcherWakeman's Skeleton Bait resembled a miniature helicopter withhooks attached. Harry Comstock's wooden bodied FlyingHelgramite looked like a deranged insect.   Many old lure companies started making their baits fromcedar, on hand-operated lathes. The lures were later primedto prevent them from swelling and cracking when they got wet.Only then did factory hands paint them and attach hooks.Every color represented a manufacturing step, including theaddition of gill marks around the face. The eyes, usuallymade of glass, were imported from Germany.   &quot;The old lures had a lot more character than the plasticones most fishermen use today,&quot; says Paul Caruso, anobsessive collector who despite running only a modestfishing-tackle store in Connecticut, last year paid $5,500for a Miller's Reversible Minnow. &quot;A modern lure usually hasa plastic seam. A hundred years ago, some lures were madewith German silver. You can't compare the quality.&quot;   Many lure makers had a sense of whimsy. There arebare-breasted Mermaid lures, lures shaped like beer bottlesand fiendishly cruel lures which keep live frogs trapped inplace for hungry bass to swallow. Many have exotic names,such as the bat-like South Bend Vacuum Bait, or thepencil-shaped Woods Poppa-Doodle or the Paw Paw Weedless Wow,a frog lure designed to avoid snagging on lily pads.   &quot;A lot of what I collect now was really designed to catchfishermen, not fish,&quot; says Richard Streater, a lure historianwho travels the West Coast giving lure chats. &quot;The generalpublic doesn't care when a plug was made, but if the legskick or the eyes blink, that's entertainment.&quot;   Fishing tackle buffs say lure collectors tend to beblue-collar workers who enjoy fishing and the outdoors.&quot;Usually they are a little zany,&quot; says Bob Lang, anengineering professor and professional cataloger of fishingmemorabilia. &quot;Fly collectors are serious and soft-spoken; rodcollectors are intense and extremely critical; reelcollectors are technical minded. But lure collectors like tohuddle in corners, tell stories, and swap their Creek ChubBeetles.&quot; Creek Chub Beetles were made in Indiana and lookedlike squat ladybugs with pearl-finish attachments.   Old lures may catch collectors, but they won't be used forcatching fish, since water is an old plug's worst enemy.Nostalgia, not practicality, drives this market. &quot;A lot ofcollectors are reliving their childhood,&quot; says Mr. Lang.&quot;When they were kids, they'd walk into a tackle shop, gaze atall these wonderful things, and only have 39 cents in theirpockets. Today they can afford them.&quot;   Others see lures as a poor man's investment opportunity,and they stalk local flea markets and antique stores forbargains. &quot;Half the thrill is the hunt,&quot; says Albert Munger,who works for the city of Philadelphia. &quot;Collectors I knoware up at 4 a.m. and out at the flea markets with theirflashlights. We're talking about real diehards.&quot; Mr. Mungerkeeps several thousand lures on his bedroom walls, much tothe chagrin of his wife.   The idea of paying money for old lures is a new concept.Back in the 1970s, lure collectors traded with each other,swapping lures and reels like kids with baseball cards. Evenin the early 1980s, a really expensive lure cost only $30.Most sold for $5 or $10 apiece.   All that changed dramatically about five years ago, saysRaymond Carver, president of the National Fishing LureCollector's Club, when Maine auctioneer Richard Olivervisited one of the national shows.   &quot;When I first met him and his entourage, they conveyed theidea that this was a fantastic hobby and that demand wouldincrease faster than supply,&quot; says Mr. Carver. &quot;He said hewas going to show us what this stuff is really worth. He did,unfortunately.&quot;   Much to Mr. Carver's dismay, fishing lures beganattracting as many investors as collectors, and as it did,prices rose. Now Mr. Carver says he is hard-pressed to add tohis own collection because he doesn't want to pay $500 ormore for the hard-to-find plugs which interest him.   &quot;Lure collecting used to be something you did withfriends,&quot; says Mr. Carver. &quot;Now it's become a question ofsupply, demand, and merchandising.&quot; Mr. Oliver agrees that hemay well have created the lure market, but says many of thosewho have sold lures through his company are glad he did so.   Contrary to what most collectors seem to think, however,basic laws of supply and demand also apply to the luremarket. Every time an old lure brings a spectacular price,folks around the country scramble like mad through theirattics or basements looking for similar baits.   The results can be wild swings in prices, especially whenthere are more lures than collectors. Knowledgeable dealers,for example, say that the Haskell Minnow which sold for$20,350 is now worth less than half of that amount. Why?Because as many as 35 to 40 such plugs have since been found.   But the diehard lure mongers like Seth Rosenbaum don'treally care. &quot;I'm in the position of somebody who has boughta $600 stock for $2,&quot; says Mr. Rosenbaum. &quot;If it drops $100,what's the difference? I'm a collector at heart.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
