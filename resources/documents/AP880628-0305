The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, fell 15 cents to $15.86 per barrel Monday on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contractfor home heating oil slipped 0.55 cent to 42.59 cents a gallon. TheJuly contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.14 cent to 51.05 cents agallon, but other months declined.   John Azarow, a trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., saidcrude prices fell in response to a report that United Arab Emiratesoil officials want to raise the oil production ceiling allotted tothem by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The UAE's current daily quota is 940,000 barrels of crude, butthe emirates already are producing 1.3 million barrels daily. TheUAE's oil council wants to raise its official ceiling to 1.5million, Azarow said.   Gasoline prices, which rose last week as crude prices dropped,apparently fell victim to profit-taking, Azarow said. The declinesin later-month contracts for gas accelerated the drop in the crudepit, he said.   ``It made the crude market even more nervous,'' Azarow said.</TEXT></DOC>
