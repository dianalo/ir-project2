Hayes   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>10/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><NS>LAW andamp; LEGAL ISSUES AND LEGISLATION (LAW)</NS><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Sexual harassment by judges is more widespread than mostlawyers believe and little has been done to punish theoffenders, according to an article in a newly released lawschool publication.   The study by Marina Angel, a professor at TempleUniversity Law School in Philadelphia, was published in thecurrent issue of Miami University School of Law's law review.</LP><TEXT>   In her article, Prof. Angel surveys reports from statecommittees that have studied sexual harassment in the courts.She recounts specific examples of judicial misconduct andsuggests some reasons why the legal system seems to toleratethe misconduct.   In her article, Prof. Angel cited a Minnesota studyshowing that 46% of women attorneys surveyed -- but only 13%of men attorneys -- reported hearing judges make remarksdemeaning to women. A New Jersey task force's report warnedthat misconduct by judges has &quot;serious consequences in thecourtroom.&quot; And a Massachusetts task force concluded that themisconduct has effectively isolated female attorneys, causingthem and sometimes their clients &quot;to doubt their ownabilities and effectiveness&quot; and to &quot;feel unwelcome.&quot;   Prof. Angel said that her study of disciplinary actionstaken against judges in several states shows that there's apattern to sexual harassment by judges: They offer to dropcharges in exchange for sexual favors, make salacious remarksto employees and litigators in court or behind closed doors,and they abuse female law clerks.   In a case Prof. Angel called &quot;particularly notorious,&quot; theNew York Court of Appeals concluded that Bertram R. Gelfand,a Bronx County judge, misused his office to &quot;prolong a sexualrelationship with a law assistant and, later, to exactpersonal vengeance when she refused to continue theiraffair.&quot; Judge Gelfand was removed from office, an actionthat's rare, said Prof. Angel.   Mr. Gelfand, who now practices law in Manhattan, notedthat he was not charged with sexual harassment. &quot;When thetrue story of my case is known, it will be a story more ofpolitical corruption and sleazy politics that used a privaterelationship in a public cause, than a story of sexharassment,&quot; he said.   Prof. Angel said she started her research two years agoafter a clerk confided to her about her boss's behavior butwouldn't go public with her complaint.   &quot;Judges are the leaders of the legal profession and it isshocking to find specific examples and statistics showing howserious the problem of sexual harassment by judges is,&quot; Prof.Angel said.   She said she was surprised to learn that there were norules requiring judges to abide by the federal rules onsexual harassment. Last year, for the first time, theAmerican Bar Association added a specific prohibition againstsexual harassment to its revised Model Rules of JudicialConduct. But those rules do not go into effect unless theyare adopted by individual states. Nevertheless, Prof. Angelsaid the ABA's revised code will be a tremendous help inreining in judges who engage in sexual harassment.</TEXT></DOC>
