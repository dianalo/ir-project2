The bill, approved yesterday on a voice vote, now goes tothe House, where it is expected to pass easily. PresidentBush, however, is expected to veto this attempt to strengthenfederal antitrust law if the measure reaches his desk. Itisn't clear whether proponents in the Senate have enoughvotes to override a veto.</LP><TEXT>   Some Republican opponents of the measure said they wouldcontinue negotiating with Democrats and Bush administrationofficials to try to forge a compromise. Sen. Arlen Specter(R., Pa.), who voted against the bill, said last-minute talksfailed yesterday. But &quot;it is a matter where we will continueto work,&quot; he said.   The threat of a Republican filibuster in the Senate haseffectively killed the bill in past years. But on a 63-35vote Wednesday, proponents led by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,Ohio) succeeded in cutting off debate to allow foryesterday's action.   In an effort to draw more Republican support, Mr.Metzenbaum accepted extensive amendments offered by Sen. HankBrown (R., Colo.). Mr. Brown's changes were designed toaddress the objections from the manufacturers' lobby.   Consumer advocates applauded passage of the legislationdespite the Brown amendments. Consumers Union and PublicCitizen, two Washington-based groups, said the bill couldsave shoppers as much as $20 billion a year.   Mr. Brown's approach included many technical wordingchanges but left in place the central goals of the Metzenbaumbill. Specifically, the modified measure would still codifythat price-fixing by manufacturers and retailers isautomatically illegal.   Supreme Court decisions during the 1980s weakeningantitrust prohibitions, as well as allegations of widespread&quot;resaleprice maintenance&quot; in such industries as consumerelectronics, have cast doubt on the legality of suchprice-fixing.   The bill approved yesterday would make it easier fordiscount retailers and the government to bring antitrustlawsuits alleging resale-price maintenance. The measureswould reduce the evidentiary requirements imposed on partiesbringing such suits. For example, discounters suingmanufacturers for conspiring with high-price retailerswouldn't have to prove that the defendants had agreed to aspecific price. Instead, a discounter could prevail byshowing that a manufacturer cut off its supply at the behestof a list-price competitor.   The Bush administration and manufacturers have said thelegislation isn't necessary and would restrict legitimaterelationships between suppliers and retailers. Sen. StromThurmond (R., S.C.), a longtime opponent of such legislation,condemned it as &quot;a special-interest bill&quot; that &quot;will beaffirmatively harmful to American business.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
