After all,Huascar is a town with dirt streets, and without runningwater, sewer systems, electricity or garbage-collectionservices. Dead dogs on the streets are as common as thedozens of live dogs, chickens and poorly clad children. Whatwas remarkable was the nonchalant reaction of most of thesettlers when questioned about the cadaver. &quot;Oh, `Sendero'killed him,&quot; was the common response. &quot;He was just a corruptcustoms official.&quot;   One would have thought they were referring to the localpolice arresting a teenager for petty vandalism, rather thanthe brutal Shining Path guerrilla movement performing an actof &quot;justice&quot; by executing a fellow townsman and leaving hisbody in the center of town. In the cycle of violence,economic deterioration and political chaos that characterizestoday's Peru, perhaps the most frightening development is theextent to which corruption and violence have eroded statecredibility and the rule of law.</LP><TEXT>   In Huascar -- one of many similar towns in which more thanhalf of Lima's population of seven million live -- violenceand Sendero have become just another aspect of the difficultday-to-day survival process. The lack of basic sanitation,electricity and water services in Lima shantytowns means thatdiseases such as typhoid and tuberculosis are widespread.Huascar, for example, has one of the highest rates ofdiarrhea in the world. Accounts of babies dying ofmalnutrition because their mothers cannot afford the carfareto get to the clinic are not uncommon. It takes littleimagination to understand why the cholera epidemic that brokeout in Peru in February spread so quickly.   Yet perhaps the most important basic services that aremissing are justice and protection from crime. Where stateofficials are present, they are known for their corruptionand inefficiency rather than anything else. They oftenattempt to extort bribes from poor migrants, who are bothnaive and desperately in need of state services such as landtitles. &quot;The only good thing about Sendero is that they killthe corrupt state officials,&quot; one Huascar woman told me. Shehad a history of frustrating experiences with the state,including one in which she sold all her belongings in orderto buy title to her land -- only to discover later that thetitle she had been sold was fraudulent.   Huascar has no police protection. The police abandonedtheir nearby post a year ago because they felt too vulnerableto Sendero. One women recounted how only a few hundred yardsaway from her house, she could see the &quot;Senderistas&quot;dynamiting electricity pylons -- which they do to black outLima. She also recounted how after voting in the Juneelections she ran home hiding her hands so that Sendero wouldnot know that she had voted; voters' index fingers areblotted with indelible ink to prevent double-voting, andSendero had threatened to &quot;chop the index fingers off&quot; allthose who voted.   In urban areas the group is careful to kill only communitymembers whom the townspeople hold in disrepute, such as thecorrupt customs official. Sendero also precludes anyindependent organization against the movement. The groupallows the traditional neighborhood organizations, mothers'clubs and communal kitchens to conduct business as usual, butthere is always a Sendero member present at all thesemeetings.   Up to this point, Sendero has allowed nongovernmental andhealth-care organizations to continue to operate, as long asthey do not &quot;meddle.&quot; On the days that Sendero is staging itsfamous &quot;paros armados,&quot; or armed strikes, these groups areadvised by the townspeople to stay home, advice that theywisely follow. Huascar increasingly is being controlled bySendero and, in the absence of any state attention orprotection, the people have little choice but to tolerate theguerrillas.   For the poor in such communities as Huascar, justice meansthe opportunity to work to improve their condition, as wellas protection from crime and terrorism. Poverty is nothingnew in Peru, although it has reached an unprecedented scaleand severity: Per-capita incomes are now at levels comparablewith 30 years ago. Yet most striking about today's poverty isthe virtual absence of opportunity. Only 9% of Lima'seconomically active population is &quot;adequately employed&quot;:defined as earning the equivalent of the 1967 minimum wage or$68 a month (the 1990 minimum wage is one-third of that --$19.75).   Education is no longer an out. Most of Peru's universitiesare hopelessly underfunded and understaffed -- andinfiltrated by Shining Path as well. A university degree isat best a ticket to drive a taxi -- usually a 1965 Volkswagenbug that is missing half its hinges. Even the middle classcan no longer afford to send its children to college. For thepoor, a high-school education has become a luxury.   In today's Peru, the chances of working one's way upwithin the system and according to the law are few and farbetween. One observer, Francisco Thoumi, has noted that thesocial and physical environment in which people operateeventually effects societal values: &quot;What occurs, simply, isthat in a society where there is a great amount of dishonestyand corruption, it becomes increasingly costly to behavehonestly.&quot;   Yet it is difficult to make the needs of the poor apolitical priority when powerful special interests have astake in the existing system. During the previous APRAgovernment of Alan Garcia, for example, the number of peopleemployed by the state sector grew by 70% while the economycollapsed and private-sector unemployment skyrocketed. NewPresident Alberto Fujimori's education minister, GloriaHelfer of the United Left Party, had a plan to reduce theeducation ministry's staff, which had grown from 193,000 to252,000 employees during the Garcia years.   APRA naturally opposed Ms. Helfer's cutting effortsbecause most of the additional posts had been filled by itsmembers. But President Fujimori was relying on APRA's supportto pass several key packages of legislation, includingapproval of his hand-picked Central Bank president. Thus,despite his commitment to reducing the governmentbureaucracy, President Fujimori supported APRA on this issue,over the objections of his own education minister. Ms. Helferresigned shortly afterward.   President Fujimori's commitment to a realistic marketstrategy is a good first step toward salvaging Peru'sdevastated economy. But unless rapid progress can be made atthe same time toward establishing state credibility andproviding employment opportunities in such areas as Huascar,the erosion of civil society and the prevalence of Sendero'slaw will be preclusive to the success of any economicstrategy. It might be a classic case where the operation wasa success, but the patient died.   ---   Ms. Graham is a guest scholar in foreign-policy studies atthe Brookings Institution in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
