My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you fromthe Oval Office, and the last.   We have been together eight years now, and soon it will be timefor me to go. But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, someof which I have been saving for a long time.   It has been the honor of my life to be your president. So many ofyou have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could sayas much to you. Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity yougave us to serve.   One of the things about the presidency is that you're alwayssomewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a carsomeone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass_ the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late andcouldn't return. And so many times I wanted to stop, and reach outfrom behind the glass, and connect. And maybe I can do a little ofthat tonight.   People ask how I feel about leaving, and the fact is parting is``such sweet sorrow.'' The sweet part is California, and the ranch,and freedom. The sorrow? The goodbyes, of course, and leaving thisbeautiful place.   You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is thepart of the White House where the president and his family live.There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like tostand and look out of early in the morning. The view is over thegrounds here to the Washington Monument, and then the Mall, and theJefferson Memorial. But on mornings when the humidity is low, youcan see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac, and theVirginia shore. Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he sawthe smoke rising from the battle of Bull Run. I see more prosaicthings: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people maketheir way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.   I have been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflectingon what the past eight years have meant, and mean. And the imagethat comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one _ a small storyabout a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor.   It was back in the early '80s, at the height of the boat people,and the sailor was hard at work on the Carrier Midway, which waspatrolling the South China Sea. The sailor, like most Americanservicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spiedon the horizon a leaky little boat _ and crammed inside wererefugees from Indochina hoping to get to America. The Midway sent asmall launch to bring them to the ship, and safety. As the refugeesmade their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor ondeck, and stood up and called out to him. He yelled, ``HelloAmerican sailor _ Hello Freedom Man.''</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
