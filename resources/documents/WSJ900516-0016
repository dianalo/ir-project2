However, company officials said the tide of policysurrenders slowed markedly this month and in April. Theofficials added that company reserves of cash and short-termsecurities totaled $2.4 billion as of March 31, enough &quot;tomeet any foreseeable policyholder obligations in a timelymanner.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A bulge in policy surrenders had been expected at FirstExecutive, whose $859 million fourth-quarter write-down ofjunk bonds stirred policyholder concerns about its financialhealth. But the latest figure is more than twice the $559million of payments for surrendered policies earlier reportedfor January and February. The sharp difference suggests thatrequests for surrenders didn't necessarily rise in March, butthat payments resulting from earlier requests swelled at theend of the quarter.   The disclosure of surrender volume was made in aSecurities and Exchange Commission filing with the company'sfirst-quarter results.   The company earned $45.4 million, or 32 cents a share,compared with a net loss of $44.1 million, or 52 cents ashare, a year earlier. The year-earlier result included a$112 million pretax write-down of First Executive'sinvestment in its insurance unit, which was partially offsetby a one-time gain of $55.8 million for an accounting change.Revenue climbed 24% to $554.5 million from $448.1 million.   First Executive said that, given its financial conditionand outlook, its board &quot;will periodically review thecontinued advisability of paying preferred stock dividends.&quot;In the first quarter, First Executive paid $10.8 million individends to holders of three classes of preferred stock.   As previously reported, First Executive has hired FirstBoston Corp. to explore a financial restructuring that couldinclude the sale of one or more of its operating units. Amongother things, the company said in its filing, it had beenconsidering a sale of more common stock. That proposal wasopposed by a major shareholder, First Executive said, withoutnaming the holder.   The company's quarterly report was filed after the marketclose. First Executive stock closed at $2.875, unchanged, innational over-the-counter trading.   Details in the SEC filing show that First Executivecontinued a major reworking of its investment portfolio,selling long-term securities and stocks and maximizingliquidity. The company said it sold about $1.58 billion netamount of securities in the latest quarter, including $1.33billion of bonds and preferred stock and $232 million ofequities.   First Executive's remaining investments include bonds witha book value of $11.59 billion but a market value of about$1.57 billion lower and equities with a cost of $603.7million and a market value of $605.5 million.   First Executive warned that, should surrenders resume atfirst-quarter levels, it could be compelled to sellsecurities and realize further capital losses.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          FIRST EXECUTIVE Corp. intended to seek approval of anincrease in its authorized capital stock at its annualmeeting later this year.
