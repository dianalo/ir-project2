The key idea is to use the left-handedspin connection as a complex coordinate on the phase space. The constraintsare simple polynomial functions of degree four or less when expressedin terms of the new conjugate variables. The reformulation is derivedstarting from a complex first-order supergravity action. The action isinvariant under left- and right-handed supersymmetry transformationswhich are not conjugate, since the connection varies in the latter casebut not in the former.</TEXT></DOC>
