<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-1096 </DOCNO><TEXT>A GFRP vessel for a multichannel SQUID-MEG has been constructed and itsmechanical properties have been studied. The tail of the GFRP vesselconsists of a spherically indented bottom plate, 120 mm radius of curvature,170 mm inner diameter, and 3 mm in thickness. The deformation behaviourof the spherical part of the bottom plate has been modelled using a finiteelement method. It has also been measured experimentally at room temperature.The analytical and experimental results are in agreement. It appearsthat the vessel is fractured by interlaminar shear stresses generatedin the materials.</TEXT></DOC>
