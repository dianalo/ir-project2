The Senate Armed Services Committee announced Monday it wouldnot act on the nomination before the holiday recess, which isexpected to start before Thanksgiving.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said more time wasneeded to analyze newly received documentation on Stello, whoappeared before the panel last Wednesday. Nunn said furtherhearings on Stello would be held after Congress returns Jan. 22.   ``We have an incomplete record now,'' Nunn said.   Stello did not return a reporter's telephone call Monday afterNunn's announcement.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, in an unusual personal appealto the committee at Stello's confirmation hearing last week, saidhe urgently needed a confirmed chief of nuclear weapons productionto carry out needed reforms.   In a statement issued on Monday, Watkins said Stello'snomination was ``one of my top priorities'' and said he expectedhim to be confirmed when Congress reconvenes.   ``I am certain that additional hearings will prove that theaccusations raised in the waning hours of this session are thosesame accusations investigated years ago and resolved,'' Watkinssaid.   There was no indication Monday whether the White House wouldinstall Stello in the job temporarily for one year by making anappointment while Congress is in recess.   Stello said last week he told Watkins he would prefer not toaccept a temporary appointment.   Stello's opponents, led by Democratic Sens. Timothy Wirth ofColorado and John Glenn of Ohio, believe Stello is not sufficientlycommitted to nuclear safety. Stello strongly denied this and vowedto carry out Watkins' orders to improve management of the nuclearweapons complex.   Some committee Republicans, including Sen. John McCain ofArizona, have accused Democrats of politically motivated delaytactics in order to kill the nomination. But Sen. John Warner ofVirginia, ranking Republican on the panel, said Monday the decisionto hold further hearings was a ``fallback procedure.''   This should not be interpreted ``as a weakness in support ... inthis nominee's chances of winning confirmation,'' Warner said,adding he did not expect the January hearings to ``produce anythingnew that we haven't heard'' about Stello.   Greenpeace U.S.A., an environmental group that has spearheaded acampaign to defeat the nomination, praised the committee's decisionto postpone a vote.   ``We managed to beat back enormous White House pressure'' toquickly confirm Stello, said Stephen Schwartz, the Greenpeacelegislative coordinator. ``It's the right move by the committee.''   Stello technically is still employed by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, where he holds the title of executive director ofoperations. But he has been working full-time for Watkins sinceJuly as an adviser on preparations for the restart of thedepartment's idled Savannah River nuclear reactors.</TEXT></DOC>
