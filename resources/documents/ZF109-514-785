(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Taking the Pulse of Today's High-End Color MarketandM;THE ANNUAL Dunn Technology Lasers in Graphics Conference was started twelveyears ago when direct laser exposure of printing plates was all the rage.andP;  Itevolved over time into a conference focused on high-end digital color systemsand the concerns of high-end color trade shops.andM;With all of the turmoil in the color market this year, we went to Lasers inGraphics to get a perspective on how the collision between &quot;high-end&quot; and&quot;low-end&quot; color systems looks from the perspective of the LIG attender.andM;This year's conference (now officially called Lasers in Graphics/ElectronicDesign in Print) was held September 9-13 at the Disney World Hotel inOrlando, Florida.andP;  As with past LIG events, the majority of the attenderswere vendors rather than users.andP;  The vendors who come tend to be those whoserve the color trade shop market.andP;  Naturally, the users who come tend to becolor printers and color trade shops.andM;The simplest way to characterize this audience may be to say that while thetypical person at a Seybold Conference thinks of PostScript as an outputimaging language, the Dunn participant is more apt to think of PostScript asan input data formatandM;Program evolution.andP;  LIG used to be known for its vendor-sponsored parties.andO;Vendors paid for the refreshment at breaks between sessions.andP;  Vendorssponsored lavish evening parties (at which most of the attenders worked forcompetitors).andP;  A good time was had by all.andM;The parties have largely been replaced with evening working sessions, andmany of the hard-sell pitches for particular products have been replaced withincredibly technical presentations.andP;  People now come to Lasers in Graphics towork.andM;As in the past few years, the program is mostly tripletracked, with sessionsrunning in each track that appeared to be of equal interest to repro houses.andO;Like most people, we tended to jump around a bit, smapling different sessionsand staying for the ones that appeared to be most interesting.andM;Participants.andP;  As noted above, the audience consists of a large number ofequipment vendors, some number of important high-end users and a small numberof Macintosh users--although many of the high-end shops now receive inputdata from Macintoshes.andM;One major shortcoming of LIG is the omission of Scitex, both from the posiumand from the audience.andP;  Dunn Technology and Scitex had a major disagreementat an LIG conference a few years agoandgt; it appears that this quarrel hasn'tbeen patched up.andP;  As a result, we heard little of Scitex at the high end ofthe market and nothing of products such as Handshake as a data transferstandard.andP;  In that light, the conference appeared somewhat biased andsuffered from the omission of established market standards.andM;In contrast, many key technical staff members from both Crosfield and Hellattended, recognizing this conference as a good opportunity to meet with manyof their key customers.andM;Standards.andP;  Tom Dunn, the president of Dunn Technology, has been the primemover behind the DDES (Digital Data Exchange Standard) for transferring colorimages between competitive, noncompatible systems.andP;  It now is known as ANSI(American National Standards Institute) standard IT8.andP;  Dunn also is a keyforce in the continuing development of this standard.andM;LIG is where much of the planning for the development of IT8 takes place.andP;  Inthat sense, LIG is very much a standards conference, but only in the sense ofthe development of mutually agreed-upon and discussed ANSI standards, and oftheir possible development into ISO (International Standards Organization)standards.andM;As an organization, Dunn Technology is against the growth of de factostandards and favors bringing such standards under an ANSI or ISO umbrella.andO;It also strongly supports the growth of accepted standards to prevent theadoption of de facto ones.andM;The desktop issueandM;The Conference is in fact two concurrent conferences: Lasers in Graphics andElectronic Design in Print.andP;  The latter event covers the linking of prepresscolor systems with clients' systems, which usually are design systems.andP;  Inthis respect, there is an element of the modern (usually Macintosh) system atthe Conference, but it generally is viewed only a means of inputting datainto the high-end system, rather than as a total system in its own right.andM;Editable PostScript.andP;  As we noted above, at a Lasers in Graphics ConferencePostScript is regarded as an input language to a high-end color system,whereas at a Seybold event PostScript is regarded as a final output languagefor driving both monochrome and color imagesetters.andP;  In this light, one ofthe hot topics at Lasers in Graphics this year was a demand for editablePostScript.andP;  People see a need for this when PostScript data is input via aconverter--such as Scitex VIP, Hell ScriptMaster of Crosfield StudioLink--toa highend system.andM;Repro shops are increasingly interested in editing these files to make latechanges.andP;  Since the file they get is in PostScript format--not Xpress,PageMaker, Illustrator or some other format--it can't be edited.andM;The market issueandM;This year's event was similar in a way to conferences covering the impact ofdesktop publiching on the typesetting market over the past few years, whenthe high end of the monochrome imaging and typesetting market was endeavoringto fight off the desktop challenge.andP;  At LIG, we saw high-end color reproshops increasingly worried about how the growth of low- and mid-range colorsystems will affect their market.andM;In the monochrome debate of a few years ago, many people predicted that therewould be continuing growth of the more sophisticated systems, and thatdesktop publishing would never affect the quality or volume markets.andP;  Thesame is true in the current color debate, and many people do not see thedesktop or typesetter-related systems affecting the quality or volume colormarket.andP;  A number of speakers predicted growth at the high end of the market,on the basis that, despite current development, the purchasers of color willstill prefer to use high-end trade shops rather than hundle color themselves.andM;Crosfield's view.andP;  For example, in the opening presentation, Brian Jordan ofCrosfield looked back over 12 years of progress in prepress areas andpredicted the following for the '90s:andM;1.andP;  High-performance, high-quality prepress will require major investments inthe '90s.andM;2.andP;  Trade services will remain a key force in the '90s.andP;  He believes thatlower-cost color electronic prepress systems alone will not generate thepredicted explosive growth in color, and that before this can happentechnological shifts will be required for output of proofs and final films.andM;3.andP;  There will be a solidifying of standards.andM;Dunn speaks.andP;  Tom Dunn covered the potential for growth in the color marketin an analysis of the potential for new color work matched against productivecapacity in the industry.andP;  He looked at the potential for 1995 against theknown color capacity and workload in 1987.andP;  He foresaw a fivehold increase incolor capacity by 1995, but because of the economic climate and limited skillavailability, he saw an increase in workload of only two to four times.andM;According to Dunn, to increase the workload of color would require improvingthe turnaround time for color production, particularly as it affectsshort-run color printing, which is where the market opportunities for newcolor are to be found.andM;To achieve this increase, he said, the high-end repro organizatins mustdevelop fully their design system links to desktop products to allow forimprovements in turnaround of color pages.andP;  We interpret that to mean thatcolor work will have to go through the high-end systemandgt; growth won't be foundamong desktop outlets that ignore the high end.andM;A minority view.andP;  Minton Brooks, from Design North, who had spoken at theSeybold Computer Publishing Conference last year, was one of the few speakersto espouse an opposing point of view.andP;  At the Seybold event, he h ad statedthat as a designeer he wanted total control of both the design and reproprocesses.andP;  At LIG, he explained how his company was adding capabilities todevelop into a full-function design and repro operation using Macintoshsystems, Optronics color scanners and PostScript output, also based onOptronics units.andM;He stated that he was not yet in a position to handle report and accountsquality, but he said that was coming.andP;  In discussions afterward, he indiatedthat the key to attaining this quality was employing a skilled colorspecialist, while at the same time adding a Macintosh-based repro-shopfunctionality to its design systems.andM;Editable PostScriptandM;The desire for editable PostScript was put forward by Rene Delbar, a keyperson on the staff of Agfa's ColorScape product line, although on thisoccasion he spoke in his position as an ANSI committee member.andP;  He outlinedwhat the IT8 committee would like as an extension or alternative toPostScript.andP;  It would specify that the standard for editable page transferwould enable, first, reconstructing and outputting the page as intended, and,second, modifying individual page elements (the page content) and theirinteraction (the page layout).andM;To achieve these goals, he propsed three levels.andP;  The first and simplest wasa peer-to-peer transfer of single-page objects and their placement, whereelements could be identified uniquely.andP;  The second was an extension of thiswith additional capabilities in editing, plus links between the design andprepress systems.andP;  The third (and highest) level would be an object-orientedarchitecture in which each object was editable.andM;Delbar doesn't view PostScript as an ideal vehicle for enabling thiscapability, so he proposed development of a new level of driver that wascloser to a system's internal data structure.andP;  This would mean that systemswould be able to convert their data to this new data transfer structure,which could be read as input by another system.andM;With this in mind, the conference invited the industry to particpated inassempling a group of experts covering the entire spectrum of the colorprepress market, at least 50% of whom have experience in PostScript anddesktop links.andP;  The group, working under the auspices of an IT8 committee,would offer its expertise, time and labor to document specific needs of colorprinting and to work together to develop and editable color data transferstandard.andM;It was hoped that companies such as Adobe would be part of this group.andM;This proposal, a continuation of the work done in developing the IT8standards, is viewed as necessary to utilize the high-level color systemexpertise available within color trade shops.andP;  It assumes that there will notbe an extension of PostScript by Adobe to create an editable form ofPostScript, and also that companies will not consider products such as QuarkXpress, Adobe Illustrator or aldus PageMaker to provide a form of editabledata transfer in which data will be transferred into another copy of the sameprogram further editing and output.andM;It is also a continuation of the belief that the industry will wait forstandards bodies such as ANSI to agree to a format.andP;  Most of the standardsthat are in volume use have come from one or more companies working togetherto create de facto standards: PostScript, Handshake, OPI, TIFF, EPSF, etc.andO;We believe that this will continue, and we may even see such developmentsannounced at the Seybold Computer Publishing Conference that will open justafter this issue goes to press.andP;  This may change some of the ideas outlinedhere for an IT8 extension.andM;Page modeling language.andP;  One of the most interesting LIG presentations, whichhappened to be in the same subject area, was made by Tom Hagan of Camex.andP;  Hesuggested that what is needed is a standard page modeling language (PML).andP;  Hestated that page description languages--particularly PostScript--failed topreserve essential page attributes: parameters for composition, grouping,trapping, etc.andP;  When PostScript is used to transfer formats, one canntaccurately interpret the data to allow for subsequent re-editing, since noparameters are available.andP;  Each application that outputs a PDL has its owninternal PML, but every application PML is different.andM;What is needed, he said, is a format that allows for interoperability.andP;  Inthe CAD/CAM market, IGES provides such a formatandgt; it came about through theneeds of users.andP;  Prior to IGES there were a range of different formats, suchas Calcomp plot format, GKS, PHIGS, CORE and GRAPHIGS, that could be said tobe the equivalent of Display PostScript.andP;  But it wasn't until users forcedthe requirement for IGES that real interoperability between systems cameabout.andM;In the office environment, Hagan stated, there is a move to standardinteroperability structures, such as the Office Document Architecture (ODA).andO;ODA has a page modeling language, but it is inadequate for many publishingapplications.andP;  Thus, another standard in needed.andP;  Hagan guessed it could takethree to four years for a standard PML to come together.andM;Adobe's Level 2.andP;  Jim King of Adobe, who briefly addressed the question of aneditable PostScript format, said that Adobe Illustrator provides a formatthat is editable PostScript,  a highly stylized subset of the PostScriptlanguage.andP;  He stated that Adobe is continuing to work in this area and thatPostScript Level 2 contains many extensions that get around some of theperceived limitations that makes the typical repro shop want to convertPostScript into something else.andP;  Level 2 will include a number ofAdobe-developed print drivers--for the Macintosh, Windows 3, and OS/2 PMinitially--that will use the language better than the drivers found today.andO;There also will be major improvements in color screening and in support fordevice-independent color.andM;Other views.andP;  It was interesting to see the approaches to editability andPDLs in some other presentations.andP;  Some of the approaches differedsignificantly depending upon the type of system the vendor offered.andP;  Quantel,for example, admitted that PostScript was the de facto standard PDL, but onlyfor line work and text, and that something else was needed for tonal data.andM;Cyberchrome, a vendor of PostScript-based color systems, stated that if onestays in the desktop environment, one maintains full editability up to outputtime.andM;The four CsandM;As we noted earlier, the conference was in many cases highly detailed andextremely technical.andP;  One of the key trends that came up in sessionsthroughout the four days was color calibration, control andcommunication--the four Cs.andP;  There were sessions covering device-independentcolor and spectro-photometry as a necessary tool for the measurement of colorfor device independenceandgt; calibration targets and tests for color scannersandgt;and the four Cs in soft-proofing monitors, electronic cameras, and colorcontrol and manipulation.andM;Scanner setup.andP;  One session included an outline of the proposed IT8.7standard for scanner targets.andP;  It was proposed that scanner setup targets bedeveloped using the Kodak Q 60 target as a base.andP;  (Q 60 is a scanner setuptarget that covers a full specification of colors, densities, etc.)andP;  TheIT8.7 proposal has four levels: IT8.7-1 is a graphic arts color transmissioninput targetandgt; IT8.7-2 is a graphic arts color reflection input targetandgt;IT8.7-3 is a CYMK colorimetric referenceandgt; and IT8.7-4 is an RGB reference forgraphic arts.andM;The currently used Kodak Q 60 target is considered a good base for covering awide color range, plus chroma and luminance changes.andP;  Such a target wouldenable a scanner to be set up to generate the standard reference-basedcolors.andP;  In this area, spectrophotometry is necessary to measure the outputsto allow exact setup.andM;This session also included presentations is great technical detail from fivevendors of spectrophotometry devices defining the specifications of theirproducts, how they worked, and some of the mathematical calculations requiredfor defining color measurement.andM;Savitar's approach.andP;  A different approach from that being offered inconjunction with the proposals under IT8.7 definitions came from a newcompany, Savitar, of San Francisco.andP;  Eric Hannah introduced SpectraPlate, aunique optical device initially in the shape of a 35mm slide that, when usedin combination with Savitar software, allows the scanned image to beconverted into a device-independent color file that is claimed to be true andaccurate to the original image.andM;SpectraPlate is an optical calibration target that contains a preciselycalibrated linear variable filter and a linear neutral-density filter.andP;  Thelinear variable filter allows the input device's color gamut to be measured,while the neutral-density filter enables the scanner's gray balance to beestablished.andM;The colors in the scanned image can be classified into two groups: colorsthat can accurately be displayed or printed and colors that will be distortedbecause of limitations of the output device or printing process.andP;  Thisadditional information is claimed to make possible color correction, graybalance and gamut matching to the output device.andP;  SpectraPlate will be ableto be incorporated within digital color printers and film recorders, makingit possible for the printer to calibrate itself automatically against a colortest pattern.andM;Savtar claims that SpectraPlate has advantages over film-based color targetssuch as the Kodak Q 60.andP;  Film-based targets claim that Savitar suffers fromthe phenomenon of metemerism, which is where film patches that use stronglycolored dyes vary their colors upon changes in the illuminating light.andP;  Foruse as a color target, the film must be bathed in controlled lighting.andP;  Thismakes it impossible to use film targets where the illuminating light isgenerally unknown.andP;  Again, it is claimed that even scanners with controlledlighting show variations with aging components that can affect a filmtarget's color.andP;  Savitar's SpectraPlate colors are stated to be fullysaturated, allowing the best signal-to-noise ratio from CCD scanning devices.andO;SpectraPlate also can easily be miniaturized and doesn't deteriorate becauseof aging and light exposure.andM;The first product to use this technology is the SpectraPlate/35, a 35mm slideformat color target for use in desktop slide scanners.andP;  It will be availablein the first quarter of 1991 and initially will be shipped with software torun in Macintosh II computers.andM;Device-independent color.andP;  In another session, color calibration was lookedat from the point of view of materials--the available transmission films, thecolor gamut they produce, and how it could be utilized.andP;  Unfortunately,because of the great technical detail, we wonder how many people in theaudience grasped the full meaning (or, in many cases, even a partialunderstanding).andP;  On point that probably was made clear, though, not only fromthis session but from some others as well, was that device-independent coloris extremely complex.andP;  There was a presentation from Electronics for Imagingthat introduced the products EFI will soon show to the world for handlingportability of color between different applications.andP;  (These issues andproducts will be covered in detail in the next issue of the Seybold Report onDesktop Publishing).andM;In addressing the question of whether device-independent color is feasible,and if so what its format will be, the opinion at LIG seemed to be that thejury is still out--and that it is likely to remain out for some time.andP;  We hadmany discussions on the benefits of 24-bit and 32-bit color spacE, onconversion between these, on which CIE format was best, on standard colorsystems and their linkages to color spaces, and on the Adobe proposals forthe different color space models in PostScript Level 3.andP;  But we found noconsensus among members of the audience at LIG apart from the belief that thequestion should come under an ANSI or SWOP (Specification for Web OffsetPublications) committee.andM;Computer to plateandM;Another topic of wide discussion was the (r)evolution of computer-to-platesystems--the subject that started the LIG conferences 12 years ago.andP;  Itappears that we are finally getting the tyype of printing plate that makesthis a realistic solution, particularly in conjunction with the increasingapplication of full, computer-to-film technology in many parts of the worldas pagination systems are used in production situations.andM;One of the key developments in this area was the Hoechst N90 high-sensitivityoffset plate introduced at Drupa.andP;  Presentations were made on materials byHoechst, Du Pont Howson, Polychrome and Mitsubishi Paper Mills.andP;  There wasalso a presentation of a working computer-to-plate system in use at AsahiShimbun in Japan, which uses a direct plate recorder from NEC Engineeringoutputting to a Mitsubishi OPC A1 plate.andM;DDAP for publication advertisingandM;It was at the LIG Conference in 1985 that the foundations of DDES were puttogether, after which Tom Dunn pushed them through with a number of systemdevelopers to create the first DDES standards (IT8.1 and IT8.2).andP;  This year,a further development in standards was put forward: the need for astandardized format for the Digital Distribution of Advertising forPublications (DDAP).andP;  It started with a request that attenders at theconference complete a questionnaire covering requirements for DDAP.andP;  Anevening roundtable discussion was set up (yes, it's not just Jonathan Seyboldwho makes conference attenders work in the evenings) at which about 40 peoplediscussed the needs for DDAP and defined what actions should be taken tobring it about.andM;The need for this standard results from quality problems in facsimiletransmission of pages of color advertising, more for magazines than fornewspapers, particularly those that are to be printed using gravure presses.andO;They tend to suffer from serious quality problems with moire, registrationand color control.andM;The discussion was led by Tom Dunn and two senior art directors from majorNew York advertising agencies.andP;  It proved interesting to analyze thequestionnaire answers from the attenders.andP;  Among its finding were thefollowing:andM;1.andP;  36% of the responses saw an immediate need for DDAP and 36% more saw aneed in two years.andM;2.andP;  The primary driving force for DDAP was integration of electronicpublishing products with advertisingandgt; secondary was cost saving.andM;3.andP;  Sizing and ad for a particular publication was the major editingrequirement, followed by adding page numbers and regionalizing the ad forlocal printing.andP;  Performing color transformations to match actual measuredprinting conditions was considered less important.andM;4.andP;  88% of the responses stated that it was necessary to provide a SWOP proofwith the ad, and 58% of the responses stated that DDAP techniques should notbe developed to eliminate the requirement for proofs.andM;5.andP;  62% of the responses said that the format for DDAP should be PostScriptplus DDES--PostScript for page definitions, line work, type and tintsandgt; DDESfor contone images and color calibration.andP;  PostScript was considered viablefor type, but a major problem was that it would require matching fontlibraries at all receiving sites.andM;6.andP;  70% of the responses said that PostScript type is almost OK, but that itneeds development in many areas.andP;  The major shortcoming is in character sets.andM;7.andP;  There was no preferred medium for conveying files, althoughcommunications was considered the most suitable, with specific distributionsystems using major carriers with broadcast facilities.andM;8.andP;  54% of the responses said that DDAP should utilize metric units, but 38%stated that both metric and English units should be used.andP;  In the context ofscanning resolution, 71% of the responses said this should follow DDESpractice, with the remainder proposing standardized resolutions based uponthe market.andM;9.andP;  Asked which organization should develop digital color proofingspecifications, the respondents preferred IT8, followed by SWOP and thenCGATS (Committee for Graphics Arts TEchnology Standards).andP;  The sameorganization should be responsible for testing various technologies that mayaffect quality, people said, as in the case of JPEG compression.andP;  Again thisshows that people in this market believe in the use of standards committeesto define standards, where it appears most likely that because of timepressures, de facto standards will be adopted by the industry.andM;10.andP;  It was agreed by 80% of responses that the objective of DDAP is toprovide a means for digital transfer of pages, partial pages and multiplepages to be selectively inserted into a larger publication.andP;  The proposedstandards would include controls for color and resolution and would specifylevels of editorial and production changes that are allowed.andM;Following this meeting, plans were made to establish a committee to developthe standards requirements and to bring in for assistance as many interestedparties as possible.andP;  Organizations interested in participating, providinginput or getting more information should contact Dunn at 1855 East Vista Way,Vista, CA 92084-3316andgt; phone (619) 758-9460.andM;The 'Best of Drupa' awardsandM;At the opening session, awards were given for what were considered to be thebest products introduced at Drupa.andP;  They were for products being seen for thefirst time, which should have been in beta testing and which should beavailable for shipment in North America by the end of 1990.andP;  Because of therange of products being shown for the first time, the beta test condition wassoftened.andP;  The winners were chosen by the 20-person LIG Executive.andO;Committee, which is drawn from users and vendors from the prepress market.andM;The following awards were made:andM;* Repro--Hoechst for the N90 high-sensitivity offset plate and 3M for theDigital Matchprint direct-digital color proofing system.andM;* Special awards--Heidelberg for the CPC digital color onpress colorspectrophotometer control system and Sun Microsystems for providing with itsSparcstations a suitable standard platform for the prepress industry.andM;* Design--Crossfield for the Mamba photo retouching system and Optronics forthe ColorGetter desktop color scanner.andM;* Prepress--Barco Graphics for the BG2000 workstation and Agfa for theColorSpace color prepress product line and the SelectSet 5000 imaging unit.andM;No doubt many readers will have different ideas, but please write to DunnTechnology, not to Seybold Publications, if you have complaints.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
