She said she saw only the second hour of the film, broadcastSunday on the ABC network. The movie, ``Baby M,'' was to concludeMonday night.   She called the film a ``whitewashed'' depiction of the surrogateagreement and ensuing battle in New Jersey courts that made her thenation's best-known surrogate.   She said she was particularly upset by the film's shallowportrayal of her ex-husband, Richard Whitehead.   The Whiteheads were divorced this year, and Mary Beth Whiteheadmarried Dean Gould. The couple had a child earlier this month.   Whitehead-Gould gained fame after she refused to surrender herinfant daughter to its biological father, William Stern, also ofNew Jersey.   Stern and his wife sued, and a New Jersey state court last yearupheld the contract under which Whitehead-Gould accepted a $10,000fee to bear Stern's child.   The contract was voided in February by the state Supreme Court,although the court let the Stern's keep the child they namedMelissa. Whitehead-Gould has visitation rights.   The made-for-television film stars JoBeth Williams asWhitehead-Gould. The film, based entirely on court records, wasmade without the cooperation of Whitehead-Gould or the Sterns.</TEXT></DOC>
