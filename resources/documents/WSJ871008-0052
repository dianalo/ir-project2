Kellogg Co.'s &quot;clean coal&quot; project, as the department came close to completing its selection of companies to share almost $400 million in aid for such projects.    Kellogg, a unit of Henley Group Inc. of La Jolla, Calif., plans to build facilities to convert high-sulfur coal to gas, remove 99% of the sulfur and burn the gas in a combined-cycle turbine capable of producing 60 megawatts of electric power. The project, to be situated near Johnstown, Pa., is projected to cost $243.8 million, with $156.3 million coming from a team of private sponsors including Kellogg and San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., the department said.    The federal contribution to the Kellogg project is more than $25 million larger than has been earmarked for any other project funded under the program, which was designed to stimulate development of processes that reduce sulfurous emissions in the burning of high-sulfur coal.    The agreement with Kellogg brings to seven the number of &quot;clean coal&quot; contracts negotiated. The energy department so far has committed $227 million in funds.    The agency also identified four projects that will get the remaining $162 million if negotiations are successful. They are sponsored by TRW Inc.'s TRW Energy Products Group; the state of Minnesota; Colorado-Ute Electric Association Inc.; and Du Pont Co.'s Consolidation Coal Co. unit with a Foster Wheeler Corp. unit. These would replace two projects eliminated in the past 10 days when the agency failed to come to terms with their sponsors, General Electric Co. and Weirton Steel Corp.    In Houston, a Kellogg spokesman declined to estimate the value of the plant to the Henley unit. A Bechtel spokesman said the parent's Bechtel Eastern Power Co. will design, construct and operate the project's power plant, and another Bechtel unit will construct the gasification plant that Kellogg designs. The facility is expected to process more than 485 tons a day of high-sulfur coal from the eastern U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
