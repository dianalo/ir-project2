Permanentmarking of product that has been refused entry and eliminating the sealingrequirement for such product will enable the Agency to more effectivelyutilize its resources, because Agency personnel will no longer have toseal product or maintain visual control over such product until it hasleft the United States or has been delivered to an animal food manufacturer.Also, since only .51 percent of imported product was refused entry in fiscalyear 1986, permanent marking of refused entry product is expected to havelittle or no impact on those entities who import product. Providing forcontrolled pre-stamping is expected to lessen inspection time for boththe industry and the Agency because it will facilitate transportation ofpre-stamped product from the establishment and should ease congestion atloading/unloading dock areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service has determinedthat this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act,Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C. 601). Permanent marking of product that has beenrefused entry and eliminating the sealing requirement for such productwill enable the Agency to more effectively utilize its resources, becauseAgency personnel will no longer have to seal product or maintain visualcontrol over such product until it has left the United States or has beendelivered to an animal food manufacturer. Also, since only .51 percentof imported product was refused entry in fiscal year 1986, permanent markingof refused enty product is expected to have little or no impact on smallentities who import product. Providing for controlled pre-stamping is expectedto lessen inspection time for both the industry and the Agency and easecongestion at loading/unloading dock areas. Product can be distributedfrom the establishment once reinspection is completed instead of beingheld there until an inspector can return to the establishment to supervisethe stamping process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Requirements</ITAG>This rule requires that import establishments desiring to operate underthe controlled pre-stamping provision apply for initial approval to theappropriate Import Field Office supervisor. This application should bein the form of a letter and should include certain information. Once approvedfor the controlled pre-stamping provision, the establishment is requiredto maintain a daily log which contains information on the product(s) thatis to be pre-stamped. Specific information requirements for the applicationand the log are outlined in the regulations. These application and recordkeepingrequirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.) as control number 0583-0015.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On June 17, 1987, FSIS published a proposed rule (52 FR 23041) to amendthe Federal meat inspection regulations by requiring that all consignmentsof product refused entry into the United States be permanently marked ``U.S.Refused Entry.'' FSIS also proposed to amend the Federal meat inspectionregulations and the poultry products inspection regulations by providingfor ``controlled pre-stamping'' under certain conditions and by deletinga requirement that refused entry product moving within the United Statesbe sealed with the official import seal. These actions resulted from areexamination of policies and procedures in effect for import inspectionwhen authority and responsibility for import inspection activities weretransferred from FSIS's Meat and Poultry Inspection Operations to its InternationalPrograms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Previous Regulatory Actions</ITAG>On August 19, 1982, FSIS published an interim rule (47 FR 36109), effectiveimmediately, that established new procedures for handling imported productto decrease the likelihood that ``refused entry'' meat and meat food productsand poultry products would enter into United States' commerce. Among theactions taken in the interim rule were prohibitions on (1) the applicationof the ``U.S. Inspected and Passed'' markings on meat and meat food productsand poultry products prior to final import inspection, also known as controlledstamping or pre-stamping; and (2) the movement of any refused entry productwithin the United States except under seal. In addition, this interim rulealso required that all consignments of meat and meat food products refusedentry be marked ``U.S. Refused Entry.'' This was consistent with a 1982General Accounting Office (GAO) recommendation in its audit of FSIS's importinspection program that FSIS should take action by ``Requiring the stampingof all rejected products on each carton or carcass as `U.S. Refused Entry'* * *.''On April 13, 1983, FSIS published a final rule (48 FR 15887) confirmingthe interim rule, as published, with one exception. The final rule didnot include the provision that required all consignments of meat and meatfood products refused entry to be marked ``U.S. Refused Entry.'' Priorto the August 1982, interim rule, containers of rejected product were identifiedby a temporary placard or label. Permanent marking of the individual productcontainers as ``U.S. Refused Entry'' was done at the discretion of thearea supervisor. In the preamble to the final rule, the Agency stated thatthe interim rule unintentionally implied that marking of all refused entryconsignments was required in addition to or instead of normal identification,which is usually by label or placard. The Agency then stated that, afterreconsideration, it was determined that the change requiring permanentmarking was not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Permanent Marking of Refused Entry Product</ITAG>Currently, containers of refused entry product are identified with temporaryplacards placed on the product containers. These placards are removed oncethe product (1) has left the United States, (2) has been converted to animalfood, or (3) has been destroyed. However, assuring proper disposition ofrefused entry product, which is identified with temporary placards, requireslabor-intensive supervision and control by Program inspectors. A Programemployee or employees must maintain control over the product until it isloaded on a vessel, has left the United States, is delivered to an animalfood manufacturer, or is destroyed for human food purposes. Controllingthe movement of refused entry product is also an activity that is performedon demand. This means that inspectors generally have to interrupt normalinspection duties to meet an establishment's request to move refused entryproduct.The Agency completed a study designed to compare, in terms of inspectorhours expended, the costs of inspecting and passing lots of imported productsto the costs of inspecting and controlling refused entry lots of importedproducts. In the 26 cases studied, the Agency found that the tasks involvedin refusing entry take four times as long as the tasks required to inspectthe lot. The study showed that, on the average, it takes approximately1 hour to inspect and pass a lot, and approximately 4 hours to inspectand process a refused entry lot.In August of 1985, 36 countries in the Western Hemisphere met at the Inter-AmericanConference on Food Protection and unanimously adopted one recommendationthat pertained specifically to refused entry product:<ITAG tagnum="21">International food shipments rejected by an importing country becauseof noncompliance with safety requirements should not be reshipped to othercountries, and a mechanism should be developed to quickly inform othercountries of such shipments.</ITAG>In addition, several Caribbean nations and Canada have asked the UnitedStates to ban the shipment of certain types of refused entry product totheir countries. Permanent marking of refused entry product would alertimporting countries of previously rejected product. FSIS is sympatheticto the needs of receiving countries for clear, unequivocal identificationof United States refused entry product. Instances in which the previoushistory of such product has been concealed from the receiving country donot promote responsible trade in meat food products.Therefore, on June 17, 1987, FSIS proposed to amend andSection;327.10(c)of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 327.10(c)) (52 FR 23041)to require that each packing unit of all consignments of meat or meat foodproducts refused entry or each carcass be marked ``U.S. Refused Entry.''This reflected FSIS's belief that Customs' control over the bonded carriersthat transport refused entry product, coupled with permanent marking ofrefused entry product, will provide adquate safeguards to assure the properdisposition of such product. In addition, requiring the marking of refusedentry meat products is consistent with the existing requirement that refusedentry poultry products be so marked (9 CFR 381.204).<ITAG tagnum="84">Elimination of Sealing Requirement</ITAG>Currently, andSection;327.13(b) of the Federal meat inspection regulations(9 CFR 327.13(b)) and andSection;381.202(b) of the poultry products inspectionregulations (9 CFR 381.202(b)) require that refused entry product be sealedbefore it is transported within the United States. This requirement waspromulgated as part of the August 1982 interim rule and April 1983 finalrule to assure that such refused entry product would not be diverted tohuman food channels.On June 17, 1987, FSIS proposed to delete this product sealing requirement(52 FR 23041) because the proposed permanent marking of refused entry productwould make sealing product containers to maintain their identity unnecessary.Documentation on the movement of all refused entry product would continueto be required by FSIS. This documentation, together with the permanentmarking of the affected product containers or carcasses, and the fact thatcarriers must be bonded under Customs' regulations, is sufficient to assurethat the product will be shipped from the United States, delivered to ananimal food manufacturer, or destroyed for human food purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Controlled Stamping Provision</ITAG>This rule also reinstates the practice known as controlled pre-stamping,that is, placing the ``U.S. Inspected and Passed'' mark on imported productbefore import inspection has been completed. This practice has developedinformally over the years as a convenience to importers to expedite theunloading of ships. However, in 1982 FSIS prohibited the practice of controlledpre-stamping imported products in the interim final rule referenced previously,because the USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) objected to thepolicy of controlled pre-stamping asserting that pre-stamping reduced FSIS'scontrol of imported product found to be adulterated or misbranded.USDA's decision in 1982 to end controlled pre-stamping was vigorously opposedby importers and was subsequently criticized by GAO. GAO noted in a June1982 letter to the Agency that based on its observations and discussionswith FSIS officials, importers, and cold storage facility firms ``it appearsthat the elimination of pre-stamping is resulting in additional producthandling by cold storage facility (service) employees, increased inspectortime, congestion at cold storage facility loading docks, and, in some cases,may be adversely affecting the quality of the imported products.'' GAOalso questioned whether FSIS, in tightening its controls over refused entryproduct, had considered marking refused entry products as ``U.S. RefusedEntry'' and if it was so considered, why did FSIS not implement this procedurerather than eliminating pre-stamping. GAO did state that it was aware ofproblems in controlling product that was pre-stamped as ``inspected andpassed'' and subsequently refused entry, but felt that proper precautionarymeasures could be instituted to eliminate or minimize these problems.Because of the criticism of the decision to end controlled pre-stamping,an Agency task force reviewed the issue and suggested various controlsunder which controlled pre-stamping might be reinstituted. The followingcontrol measures were proposed at that time: (1) Limiting controlled pre-stampingto only those lots that will be inspected the same day, (2) requiring thatall product which receives controlled pre-stamping remain at the establishmentuntil import inspection occurs, (3) requiring inspection marks to be removedfrom containers refused entry on the day a refused entry determinationis made (under FSIS' direct supervision and, if overtime, on a reimbursablefee basis), (4) denying controlled pre-stamping to those lots requiredto be held at the establishment pending the receipt of laboratory results,(5) requiring the establishment to apply for permission from the ImportField Office (application signed by company official, acknowledging intentto comply), (6) requiring the establishment to reapply each year, and (7)vesting local import inspection personnel with the authority to suspendcontrolled pre-stamping on the spot.Subsequently, in the 1987 porposal, FSIS proposed to amend andSection;andSection;327.10and 381.204 to reinstitute controlled pre-stamping subject to these controls(52 FR 23041). In addition, it was proposed that controlled pre-stampingbe provided only at port of entry locations.U.S. Customs Service personnel have reviewed the proposed controls andhave agreed to pursue any violation of the control provisions by liftingthe Customs' bond in effect of the product.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments on the Proposed Rule</ITAG>FSIS received 3 comments in response to the proposed rule: 1 from a tradeassociation, 1 from an industry member, and 1 from a representative ofa New Zealand trade association. The following are the issues raised bythe commenters and FSIS's response to each.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two of the commenters objected to permanent marking ofproduct as ``U.S. Refused Entry.'' One of these commenters stated thatpermanent marking was not within the authority of the Federal Meat InspectionAct (FMIA). The other commenter stated that product could be refused entryand, thus, so marked solely for ``procedural defects'' not related to thequality of the product. This commenter also stated that such permanentmarking of product could be disproportionate to the kind of problem thatcaused the product to be rejected.<T3>Response: </T3>The FMIA provides the Secretary of Agriculture withclear authority to regulate meat products offered for importation intothe United States. Under section 20 of the FMIA, the Secretary is responsiblefor assuring that imported products do not enter United States commerceif they are found to be adulterated or misbranded or otherwise not in compliancewith any provision of the FMIA or regulations thereunder applicable tosuch product in commerce within the United States, and is authorized toprescribe terms and conditions for the destruction of products refusedentry unless they are exported. Permanent marking is a means to keep ``refusedentry'' products out of United States commerce and, as discussed in thepreamble, to inform foreign countries of rejected product shipments, regardlessof cause. Indelible marking is the most effective and efficient means ofproviding clear, unequivocal identification of such product to third countries.Imported product is not likely to be refused entry due solely to innocuous``procedural defects.'' Under current procedures, if a shipment of productis rejected because of missing or incomplete documentation, FSIS providesthe exporting country an opportunity to correct the problem before theproduct is officially rejected. Also, when product undergoes re-inspection,noted defects are classified according to their severity and number. Thetypes and number of defects determine whether a lot of product passes orfails reinspection. If product is refused entry and is intended for reexportto a third country, FSIS notifies the country of the specific cause ofthe rejection. In this way, one shipment can be distinguished from anotherand the foreign country can decide whether to accept or reject the shipmentbased on the reasons for rejection.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that FSIS provide a 24-hour periodbetween the time product is pre-stamped and is then ultimately reinspectedby FSIS. (The proposal stipulated that pre-stamping would only be providedfor lots of product that would be reinspected on the same day.) The commenterstated that a 24-hour period would result in increased efficiency for bothFSIS and the industry.<T3>Response: </T3>FSIS intends to retain this provision as proposed_toprovide controlled pre-stamping only to those lots that the inspector hasdetermined will be reinspected later the same day. This limitation_thatthe inspector completes both facets of the reinspection the same day_ensuresthat the same import inspector and establishment employee are communicatingabout the same products. It minimizes the potential for misunderstandingsthat might result in the distribution of pre-stamped product from the establishmentbefore completion of reinspection.One change has been made in the language of andSection;andSection;327.10(d)and 381.204(f) to indicate specifically that the application for controlledpre-stamping will be approved by the Director, Import Inspection Division,not the Administrator, as was stated in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>After careful consideration of the comments received and all other availableinformation, FSIS is amending Part 327 of the Federal meat inspection regulationsand Part 381 of the poultry products inspection regulations as set forthbelow.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>9 CFR Part 327Imported product, Meat inspection.9 CFR Part 381Imported product, Poultry inspection.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 327_IMPORTED PRODUCT</ITAG>1.
