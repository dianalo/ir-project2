Claude Pepper.    Gerald Richman captured 61% of the votes in Tuesday's Democratic primary, defeating former Miami City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy in the battle for the seat Mr. Pepper held for 27 years. Mr. Pepper, who became known as a leading spokesman for the nation's senior citizens, died May 30 at age 88.    Mr. Richman's opponent in the Aug. 29 runoff will be state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, whose campaign is being run by Jeb Bush, one of President Bush's sons. President Bush made an appearance on her behalf yesterday before flying to Maine to begin his vacation.    Each side in the ethnically charged campaign has accused the other of being divisive. The campaign is being waged in the district that includes Miami and has the highest percentage of Cuban-born voters in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
