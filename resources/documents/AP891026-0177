After nearly seven weeks of wrangling, House and Senateconferees cited pressure from congressional leadership to adjournby Thanksgiving and the planned start on a defense spending bill bythe appropriations committees next week as the reasons for the pushto finish.   ``It's coming together,'' said Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., amember of the House Armed Services Committee.   Late Thursday, House and Senate conferees on procurement andresearch and development met separately to mull over the latestproposals, including the following:   _Approximately $255 million for research and development of theMarine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, but no procurementmoney. The future of the program would be tied to commercial use ofthe V-22, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requestedanonymity.   _A plan to purchase 18 of the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fightersin fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal 1991.   Bush has proposed canceling the two conventional programs,decisions that met with strong opposition on Capitol Hill.   _About $950 million for the National Guard and reserves. TheHouse bill had earmarked $1.2 billion for the guard and reserves.   Lawmakers ruled out a final agreement on the defense bill byweek's end, but said a resolution was possible sometime next week.   Among the other compromises still being considered between thetwo widely divergent House and Senate blueprints for the fiscalyear that began Oct. 1:   _A Pentagon total of $3.55 billion for SDI, popularly known asStar Wars, according to Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, rankingRepublican on the House Armed Services panel.   The total represents a $1.1 billion cut in Bush's request and isabout $200 million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989. Thecompromise is a split between the $2.8 billion approved by theHouse and $4.3 billion the Senate adopted, but does not includeabout $250 million in Department of Energy money and militaryconstruction dollars.   ``This is the first time it will take a real hit,'' saidRowland, who indicated that strategic programs are suffering at thehands of conventional programs that translate into jobs inlawmakers' home districts.   _Approximately $1.2 billion for the MX multiple-warhead,rail-based missile and the Midgetman single-warhead, truck-basedmissile, which is equivalent to the $1.1 billion Bush proposed forthe MX and $100 million for the Midgetman, Dickinson said.   However, the proposal requires Cheney to cut $100 million fromthe $1.2 billion and gives him the discretion on how to spend theamount remaining. Cheney had favored funding only the MX missile,but Bush opted for the two land-based nuclear missiles.   The proposal also includes House language imposing a 50-missilecap on the MX, the total number of the missiles currently in fixedsilos.   Lawmakers and congressional sources who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the other proposals being consider include money tobuy two stealth bombers in fiscal 1990 and parts for five in fiscal1991.   The Bush administration had sought funds to buy three of thebat-winged aircraft in fiscal 1990 and components for five infiscal 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
