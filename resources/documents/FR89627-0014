On October5, 1978 (43 FR 46011), USEPA designated Trumbull County as nonattainmentfor ozone. The revision requests a relaxation of emission limitations forGM's volatile organic compound (VOC) topcoat and final repair coatingsoperations, as established under Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Rule 3745-21-09(C).USEPA has determined that this revision request would not constitute RACTas required under the CAA.On June 29, 1988 (53 FR 24450), USEPA proposed to disapprove a site-specificSIP revision for the GM Lordstown auto assembly facility. Both OEPA andGM commented on the proposed disapproval. OEPA's comments are repeatedin full in this final rule. However, due to their length, portions of GM'scomments are abbreviated and/or paraphrased. USEPA's responses are basedupon the full comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments and USEPA's Responses.</ITAG>Ohio EPA's August 12, 1988, Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) USEPA FR Comment    </ITAG>GM's revised limit for its topcoat operation would amount to an averageVOC content of 5.2 lbs VOC per gallon of coating, minus water. USEPA doesnot consider such a high VOC content as REACT for automotive topcoats,based upon past Agency analyses. USEPA must consider Ohio's request forGM Lordstown as a permanent relaxation, because Ohio has failed to specifya date for conversion of GM's coating operations to base coat/clear coat.   <T3>Ohio EPA Response. </T3>The USEPA refers to ``past Agency analyses,''but does not identify them in either the NPR or Region V's TSD. If thisphrase refers to the CTG for automobile and light-duty truck assembly plants,it would not be a proper basis for disapproving the SIP revision. Obviously,the SIP revision is facility-specific. The approvability of the SIP revisionmust rise or fall based upon facility-specific considerations. The CTGestablishes a presumptive norm for RACT, and the USEPA has indicated, asa matter of policy, that States have the latitude to establish an alternativedefinition of RACT for a particular facility if the presumptive norm isdetermined to be unreasonable. This is precisely what the Ohio EPA is proposingfor the GM Lordstown facility_an alternative definition of RACT for thetopcoat and final repair operations. Therefore, we must consider the statementthat the ``USEPA does not consider such a high VOC content as RACT'' asnothing more than unsubstantiated opinion.             It is true that the variances for the topcoat and final repair operationsdo not contain a deadline for conversion to base coat/clear coat technology.Nevertheless, the USEPA has been fully aware of the fact that GM and theOhio EPA have not considered the SIP revision to constitute a permanentrelaxation. The Ohio EPA and GM have always considered the SIP revisionto be a temporary relaxation. This was pointed out clearly to the USEPAin the Ohio EPA's Fact Sheet for the variances, as was the reason why GMcould not commit to a firm date for the base coat/clear coat conversionas part of the terms and conditions of the variances. The fact that GMactually completely (sic) the conversion in September 1987, confirms thetemporary nature of the SIP revision. The USEPA's October 21, 1981, policy on automobile coatings provides forcompliance date extensions through 1987 for topcoats. This approach wasnot pursued by the Ohio EPA because, as mentioned above, GM did not knowexactly when the base coat/clear coat conversion would occur, and therewas a good likelihood it would not occur by the end of 1987. In retrospect,if this approach had been followed, there would not have been a need fora redefinition of RACT for the GM Lordstown topcoat and final repair operationsand there would not have been a basis for the USEPA's pending enforcementaction against the Lordstown facility. In order to remove the USEPA's concern that the SIP revision constitutesa permanent relaxation, the Ohio EPA will be modifying the variances inthe near future to specify an expiration date of December 31, 1987. Oncethe variances have been officially modified, they will be submitted tothe USEPA. In the meantime, however, the pending SIP revision should beevaluated as a temporary relaxation for the period from January 1, 1986through December 31, 1987. <T3>USEPA Response. </T3>Both USEPA's past guidance on RACT for automotivetopcoat operations (the Control Technique Guideline (CTG) document forautomotive coatings) and current guidance (the May 25, 1988, document titled``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations'')present RACT for automotive topcoat operations to be 2.8 lbs VOC/gallonof coating. USEPA is not aware of having approved a permanent limit of5.2 lbs/gallon as RACT for automotive topcoat operations. If Ohio's positionis that GM Lordstown's topcoat operation is different from all other topcoatoperations required to meet 2.8 lbs VOC/gallon at 30 percent transfer efficiency,or less than 5.2 lbs VOC/gallon, it has not demonstrated this position.This is the fundamental test that must be met to obtain a permanent relaxationsubstantially less stringent than what is generally required. It does not matter ``that GM and the Ohio EPA have not considered the SIPrevision to constitute a permanent relaxation.'' USEPA is limited to reviewingwhat has been formally submitted to it and Ohio's October 21, 1986, submittalconstitutes a permanent relaxation. If Ohio submits a compliance date extension in the future, it will be reviewedas such. However, it is not possible for USEPA to do so with the submittalwhich is currently before it. <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) USEPA FR Comment </ITAG>In a memorandum of February 7, 1986, USEPA's Economic Analysis Branch (EAB)presented its evaluation of GM's cost analysis for spray booth controls.EAB's annualization techniques resulted in a systematic 19 percent reductionin GM's annualized costs. Therefore, GM's cost analysis appears to haveoverestimated these costs. <T3>Ohio EPA Response. </T3>There is an underlying fallacy in this conclusion.The USEPA has assumed that the EAB's methods for calculating the annualizedcosts are more accurate than those used by GM. No information has beenprovided by the USEPA to support this assumption. In fact, the February7, 1986, EAB memorandum referenced in the NPR states the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">(a) GM's costing procedures are appropriate; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) the capital and operating cost estimates prepared by GM are acceptablefor this specific application; * * * </ITAG>Also, the January 31, 1986, EAB memorandum, which provides the detailsof their cost estimates, states the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">Note that, for all three options, the EAB C/E (cost effectiveness)is lower, and by the same amount (19 percent). This difference is solelydue to the different methods and assumptions used in calculating the totalannual/levelized costs.</ITAG>Nowhere in the January 31, 1986, memorandum does the EAB characterize itscost estimates as being more accurate than GM's, nor does the EAB statethat GM has ``overestimated'' the costs. In summary, the difference between GM's and the EAB's cost estimation techniquescannot form a basis for disapproval of the SIP revision, especially whenit has not been determined that the EAB's approach is more accurate. <T3>USEPA Response. </T3>In order to evaluate C/E numbers, it is necessarythat C/E results be based upon standard USEPA techniques. As stated inthe January 31, 1986, memorandum titled ``Carbon Adsorption Costs: GM LordstownAssembly Plant'' (which is referred to above by Ohio): <ITAG tagnum="21">To put C/E results on an equal footing with those estimated for NSPS,NESHAP, CTG, and most other [Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards]OAQPS cost analyses, USEPA calculated the total annual cost and C/E foreach option, using both the GM ``raw'' capital and operating and maintenance(Oandamp;M) costs, and the factors and assumptions normally employed in OAQPScost analyses. </ITAG>Comparing C/E values, as Ohio EPA has done, which have been developed differentlyis meaningless. <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) USEPA FR Comment </ITAG>GM currently uses a 27 percent solids dispersion lacquer (DL) topcoat coating.In a November 1978 report, entitled ``Study to Determine Capabilities toMeet Federal USEPA Guidelines for VOC Emissions'', GM proposed to convertoperations to higher solids solvent systems until waterborne coatings couldbe used to achieve final compliance with RACT limits. At that time, thefacility was at 17 percent solids DL, which formed the appropriate baselinefrom which to figure cost-effectiveness. An interim increase to 27 percentsolids DL was part of GM's plan to obtain an additional 5 years to achievefinal compliance with the emission limits. Therefore, it is inappropriatefor GM to later revise its baseline for determining cost-effectivenessto the 27 percent solids content which GM previously identified as an interimlimit to support a compliance date extension, which GM received on October31, 1980 (45 FR 72122). <T3>Ohio EPA Response. </T3>It is very interesting to note that the OhioEPA initially raised the question concerning the proper baseline for calculatingcost-effectiveness, i.e., 17 percent solids DL or 27 percent solids DL.The Ohio EPA's position was that 17 percent solids DL was the proper baseline.However, in discussions with the EAB, GM was informed that incrementalcost-effectiveness, and hence a 27 percent solids DL, was the proper methodfor determining RACT. Now the USEPA is saying that the use of a 27 percentsolids DL baseline is a reason for disapproving the SIP revision. Whichposition represents the real USEPA position on this issue?In reviewing the variance applications submitted by GM, we considered theissue of economic reasonableness by looking at both a 17 percent solidsDL baseline and a 27 percent solids DL baseline. The results of these analyseswere discussed in detail in the following sections of the Fact Sheet forthe variances: <ITAG tagnum="21">If GM were to try to comply with the 2.8 lbs VOC/gallon limitationfor the topcoat coating lines through the use of add-on control equipment,incinerators would have to be installed for the 2nd undercoat and 3rd lacquerovens, and carbon adsorption would have to be installed for the 27 stackpairs associated with the 1st lacquer spray booth. This would require acapital expenditure of $38 million. <T3>The overall cost-effectiveness of this control strategy from a 27 percentsolids lacquer emission baseline would be in excess of $15,000/ton. Froma 17 percent solids lacquer emission baseline (i.e., prior to the conversionto 27 percent solids DL and the installation of the incinerator for the1st lacquer oven), the cost-effectiveness would be approximately $5,700/ton.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">GM also investigated the cost-effectiveness of a ``RACT equivalentbubble'' for the topcoat coating lines. This control strategy would involve(a) the use of carbon adsorption for the 15 most concentrated stack pairsassociated with the 1st lacquer spray booth, (b) conversion to a waterbornedeadener material, and (c) conversion to a super high solids elpo (prime)material. A capital expenditure of $24 million would be required, and <T3>the overall cost-effectiveness from a 27 percent solids lacquer emissionbaseline would be almost $6,500/ton. From a 17 percent solids lacquer emissionbaseline, the cost-effectiveness would be approximately $2,700/ton. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The overall cost-effectiveness values for strict compliance with the2.8 lbs VOC/gallon limitation (i.e. $5,700/ton and $15,000/ton) and forcompliance by means of a ``RACT equivalent bubble'' (i.e., $2,700/ton and$6,600/ton) are well above the levels used by the USEPA in defining RACTfor various VOC source categories. For example, <T3>the definitions of RACT for the USEPA's RACT I, II and III source categories,of which the surface coating of automobiles is one, are generally basedupon cost-effectiveness values that are well below $2000/ton. Furthermore,concerning the proposed ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources;Magnetic Tape Manufacturing Industry,'' the USEPA indicates that a cost-effectivenessof $1,100 per ton ``is in the upper end of the range of cost-effectivenessvalues that EPA is currently using to make decisions on the appropriatelevels of nontoxic VOC emissions. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">GM did not investigate the costs of employing add-on controls forthe final repair topcoat coating lines because it is the company's opinionthat due to the low VOC concentrations, the low annual VOC emission rates,and the large volumes of exhaust gases, the controls would not be any morecost-effective than the controls that were investigated for the topcoatspray booths and ovens (emphasis added throughout).</ITAG>It is clear from the above that whichever baseline is used, the use ofcontrol equipment to achieve strict compliance with the existing regulationsor RACT-equivalence is economically unreasonable. Therefore, GM's use ofa 27 percent solids DL baseline cannot be a valid basis for disapprovalof the SIP revision. <T3>USEPA Response.</T3> USEPA has not established a specific policy onwhat place incremental cost-effectiveness plays in RACT evaluations. RACTis based upon a case-by-case evaluation of technical and economic feasibility.It is not possible to comment on OEPA's discussions with the EAB, as thesediscussions were not documented. USEPA does not base economic feasibility upon a rigid C/E cutoff. As indicatedby OEPA's response, use of a 17 percent solids DL baseline will resultin substantially lower C/E values than use of a 27 percent DL baseline.USEPA maintains the position stated in the NPR. The appropriate baselinefrom which to evaluate cost-effectiveness is 17 percent DL. The interimstep of 27 percent was presented as part of GM's support to obtain an additionalfive years to achieve final compliance. It is, therefore, inappropriatefor GM to later revise its baseline for determining cost-effectivenessto what was previously identified by GM as an interim limit to supporta compliance date extension, which GM received. Also, refer to USEPA'sresponse to GM's comment II C.3.<ITAG tagnum="81">(4) USEPA FR Comment</ITAG>OEPA determined the overall cost-effectiveness of each of the various combinationsof control measures that GM could employ. For each combination, OEPA alsodetermined whether a combination would result in a RACT equivalent VOCemission reduction. OEPA's analysis indicated that certain combinationsof control measures, considered by OEPA to result in emission reductionsequivalent to RACT, were reasonably cost-effective. <T3>Ohio EPA Response.</T3> This issue is addressed above in the paragraphsexcerpted from the Fact Sheet for the variances. A RACT-equivalent combinationof control measures would have cost-effectiveness values of $6,600/tonand $2,700/ton for a 27 percent solids DL baseline and a 17 percent solidsDL baseline, respectively. Even the lower of these 2 values cannot be consideredreasonable when compared to the levels that are normally used by the USEPAto define RACT. Please note that all of the cost estimates prepared by GM (and by the USEPA)assumed a 10-year useful life for the control equipment. If a useful lifeof 2 years were used, based upon the date the conversion to base coat/clearcoat actually was completed, the cost-effectiveness values would be considerablyhigher than those mentioned above. The importance of the temporary natureof the SIP revision cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, in summary, the USEPA's assertion that the RACT-Equivalent combinationof control measures is ``reasonably cost-effective'' is false and is nota valid basis for disapproval of the SIP revision. <T3>USEPA Response.</T3> As stated previously, USEPA has not set a C/Ecutoff which can be used as the sole basis for determining whether a specificlevel of control is economically feasible. Ohio's comment that a 2-year,rather than a 10-year, control equipment useful life should be used inevaluating C/E is invalid. Ohio's proposed SIP revision is a permanentrelaxation and must be evaluated as such. <ITAG tagnum="81">(5) USEPA FR Comment</ITAG>GM failed to investigate the option of continuing to use a 17 percent solidsDL with add-on spray booth controls, which could result in VOC emissionlevels significantly less than current topcoat emissions. <T3>Ohio EPA Response. </T3>This statement is inaccurate and surely isnot a valid reason for disapproval of the SIP revision. This issue wasspecifically addressed in a June 4, 1986, letter from GM to the Ohio EPA.The letter was included as part of the technical support for the SIP revision.The information provided by GM indicates that it would be less cost-effectiveto achieve compliance with the existing regulations by using control equipmentand a 17 percent solids DL than by using control equipment and a 27 percentsolids DL. Therefore, both options must be considered to be economicallyunreasonable. <T3>USEPA Response.</T3> GM's June 4, 1986, letter does address a 17 percentDL baseline and add-on controls. However, it appears that use of 17 percentDL, and 1st color spray booth and oven controls would result in substantiallyless emissions than use of 27 percent DL and incineration of the firstcolor oven emissions. GM does not appear to have evaluated the feasibilityof 1st color spray booth and oven controls (before converting to 27 percentDL) as an alternative to the permanent relaxation which was proposed byOhio EPA. The cost-effectiveness value of spray booth controls is lowerwith 17 percent DL. RACT is defined as the lowest emission limit that aparticular source is capable of meeting by the application of control technologythat is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.The existence of a more stringent alternative, which is economically andtechnically feasible, is a sufficient demonstration that Ohio's proposedrevision does not constitute RACT. <ITAG tagnum="81">(6) USEPA FR Comment</ITAG>OEPA determined that the use of air cascading for three stack pairs wouldlower GM's cost-effectiveness estimates by approximately 20 percent. <T3>Ohio EPA Response.</T3> It is true that the use of air cascading couldpotentially reduce the capital costs, and hence the cost-effectiveness,for any particular control measure or combination of measures. However,it is not likely that this change alone would be sufficient to enable compliancewith the existing regulations in an economically reasonable manner. Also,if this reduction in cost-effectiveness is considered along with the increasein the cost-effectiveness that would result if the useful life of the controlequipment were changed from 10 years to 2 years, the final conclusion thatit is economically unreasonable to comply with the existing regulationsdefinitely would not be changed. Here again, this reason cannot be a basisfor disapproving the SIP revision, especially when considering the temporarynature of the SIP revision. <T3>USEPA Response. </T3>Ohio EPA does not appear to disagree with thesubject comment. As stated previously, basing cost-effectiveness on a usefullife of 2 years (instead of 10 years) is inappropriate because this proposedSIP revision is a permanent relaxation. Ohio's reference to the ``temporarynature of the SIP revision'' is, therefore, incorrect.<ITAG tagnum="81">(7) USEPA FR Comment</ITAG>GM's variance would result in VOC emissions of 945 tons per year greaterthan the RACT allowable in an ozone nonattainment area.<T3>Ohio Response. </T3>This statement is misleading. It is true that theSIP revision would allow an additional 945 tons of VOC emissions/year abovethe RACT allowable for the Lordstown facility. It is not accurate, however,to describe the Mahoning/Trumbull ozone demonstration area as a nonattainmentarea. It is a designated nonattainment area, but there have been no violationsof the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone in the area forthe past 6 calendar years (1982-1987). Also, it is interesting to notethat the air quality standards for ozone were maintained in the Mahoning/Trumbulldemonstration area even before the Lordstown plant reduced VOC emissionsby (a) conversion to the 27 percent solids DL and installation of the incineratorfor the 1st lacquer oven emissions (1770 tons/year reduction) and (b) conversionto base coat/clear coat (909 tons/year reduction).Furthermore, the Mahoning/Trumbull ozone demonstration area has a federallyapproved ozone SIP. The VOC emission reductions required by the approvedSIP have been achieved in a timely manner and, in fact, have been far exceeded.Neither the ambient air quality monitoring data nor the data generatedto track compliance with the approved ozone SIP indicate that the SIP revisionfor the Lordstown plant has jeopardized the attainment or maintenance ofthe ozone standard.On March 1, 1985, the Ohio EPA submitted a request to the USEPA to redesignatethe Mahoning/Trumbull ozone demonstration area to an attainment status.The request was supplemented with additional data on November 1, 1986.To date, the USEPA has taken no action on this request. However, if theUSEPA were to approve the redesignation request, and we believe there isno reason not to approve it, the SIP revision would immediately be approvableby the USEPA because all the issues relating to RACT would become moot.In summary, the simple fact that the Mahoning/Trumbull ozone demonstrationis designated nonattainment is not a sufficient reason to disapprove theSIP revision. The nonattainment designation belies the fact that therehave been no monitored air quality violations. In actuality, the area isan attainment area, and the SIP revision has not prevented the maintenanceof the attainment status. Even the TSD prepared by the USEPA states that``approval of the SIP revision would not interfere with attainment or maintenanceof the NAAQS in the Youngstown demonstration area.''<T3>USEPA Response.</T3> Although, USEPA's February 9, 1989, TSD does statethat the approved Youngstown attainment demonstration does have sufficientVOC increment available to accommodate this SIP revision, subsequent monitoringdata showing violations call into question the adequacy of this demonstration.There have been six exceedances at the Mercer County (Pennsylvania) monitorin the period from 1986 through 1988. Mercer County is an adjoining downwindcounty to the Mahoning/Trumbull area. This County is viewed by USEPA asa recipient of ozone generated by Mahoning and Trumbull County VOC emissions.Trumbull County remains a designated ozone nonattainment area because ofthese violations.<ITAG tagnum="81">(8) USEPA FR Comment</ITAG>In a memorandum of December 19, 1986, EAB provided additional informationon GM's cost assessment, which indicated that GM appeared to emphasizeperformance under all conceivable circumstances and a minimum adjustmentof spray booth operations in analysis of its carbon adsorption equipment.EAB stated that an analysis which considers various engineering and operationalcompromises (e.g., reduced air flow through the paint booth) in order tolower overall cost would be a more appropriate basis by which to assessachievement of RACT.<T3>Ohio EPA Response.</T3> The issues raised by the EAB in the December19, 1986, memorandum, were addressed in detail in an April 2, 1987, letterfrom GM to the USEPA. It is apparent that GM has seriously considered all``engineering and operational compromises'' that could significantly reducethe overall costs for various control measures. We believe that even thoughsome improvements may be feasible, they would not be sufficient to resultin a determination that the use of control equipment to achieve compliancewith the existing regulations is economically reasonable. This is especiallytrue when considering the temporary nature of the SIP revision.<T3>USEPA Response.</T3> USEPA agrees that some improvements are feasible.Exhaust air recirculation is one of the approaches presented in GM's April2, 1987, letter to USEPA. Spray booth recirculation is being used by automotivemanufacturers outside the United States (including by GM in Ontario) andis planned for use within the United States. As stated previously, thisis not a temporary SIP revision.GM's July 28, 1988, Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG> I. <T3>EPA is required to approve this SIP revision, whether or not it constitutesRACT</T3>_A. <T3>The variance will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of ambientair quality standards.</T3> GM states that, according to Ohio's 1979 ozoneSIP, total VOC reductions in the Mahoning/Trumbull County area exceededthe amount required to ensure attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS inthe Youngstown area. GM also states that the Youngstown area has attainedand consistently maintained the NAAQS since the end of 1981.B. <T3>EPA may not properly apply the RACT requirement to this variance.</T3>GM's position is that Mahoning/Trumbull Counties are, in fact, attainmentareas for ozone, even though they are designated nonattainment areas. ``EPAmay not disapprove a SIP revision on the grounds that it is not RACT, whileat the same time it is unlawfully withholding action on a redesignationrequest which, if approved, would eliminate the RACT requirement.''<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>There is no basis for GM's position that a designated ozone nonattainmentarea can be considered as an attainment area. The proposed redesignationof Mahoning/Trumbull is the subject of a separate rulemaking action.The April 4, 1979, ``General Preamble for Proposed Rulemaking'' states(44 FR 20376) ``For SIPs with attainment dates before the end of 1982 thatdo not use photochemical disperson modeling, these RACT requirements mustapply to all major sources covered by each CTG, and in urbanized areasto enough additional sources covered by each CTG to provide for reasonablefurther progress and attainment as expeditiously as practicable.''Photochemical dispersion modeling was not used in the Mahoning/Trumbullattainment demonstration. Therefore, RACT is required regardless of whetherthe attainment demonstration indicates that RACT was required by GM Lordstownfor attainment to be achieved in the Youngstown area.In addition, please refer to USEPA's response to Ohio's Comment No. 7.<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG>II. <T3>EPA has articulated no rational basis for its conclusion that the variancesdo not constitute RACT._</T3>A. <T3>The proposal does not provide an adequate explanation of the Agency'sbasis for its determination.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>USEPA disagrees with GM's opinion. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR)provides an adequate basis for the proposed disapproval. As stated in 53FR 24450.<ITAG tagnum="21">USEPA has evaluated this revision to determine if Ohio has demonstratedthat the revised limits would be RACT for GM Lordstown. To do this, Ohiowould have had to demonstrate that the present VOC regulations are eithereconomically or technically infeasible and the new limits are RACT.

Furthermore, GM has, in fact, converted its paint shop and appearsto be using final repair coatings which do not exceed 4.8 lbs VOC per gallon.There does not appear to be a reasonable basis for approving a permanentrelaxation from a limit which is being met.<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG>C. <T3>The conclusory statements listed by EPA do not provide a rational basisfor disapproving the topcoat variances.</T3>USEPA bases its proposed disapproval of the Lordstown topcoat varianceson eight unconnected and conclusory statements. Several of these statementsare simply reiterations of statements made by others with no indicationof whether the Agency has accepted them as true, or the reasons for thatacceptance if it has occurred. Many of these statements are contradictedby the record. Others are based on mischaracterizations of facts and statementstaken out of context. Finally, those statements which are accurate do notconstitute a rational basis for rejection of the State's determinationthat the variances, rather than the existing SIP, constitute RACT.GM listed its objections to each of the eight reasons for disapproval listedin the NPR.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>EPA Statement:</T3> USEPA does not consider [5.2 lbs. VOC per gallon]as RACT for automotive topcoats, based on past Agency analysis.</ITAG>EPA does not identify the ``past Agency analyses'' on which this assertionis based. Nor are any such analyses included in the record. For these reasonsalone, this conclusion cannot provide a rational basis for disapproval.Furthermore, to the extent the ``past Agency analyses'' relied on are thosecontained in the Agency's May 1977, Control Technique Guideline (``CTG'')for automobile surface coating operations, those analyses do not supporta categorical assertion that 5.2 lbs. VOC per gallon of coating is notRACT.The CTG is more than 10 years old and does not take into account severalprofound changes which have occurred in automotive coatings and in economicconditions during this period. GM described the following categories ofchanges: The demise of waterborne topcoats, development of Base Coat/ClearCoat (BC/CC), and the development of hi-solids lacquers and improved applicationtechniques. GM added that in addition to being obsolete, the CTG analyseswere never intended to define RACT. To the contrary, ``[t]he primary purposeof each CTG [was] to inform the State and local air pollution control agenciesof pollution control techniques available for reducing emissions of VOCfrom the class of sources covered by the CTG.'' 44 <T4>Federal Register</T4> 53762 (September 17, 1979).GM added that RACT in short, is to be based on a ``case-by-case review''of ``the particular sources being regulated'', not on a generalized analysisof ``capabilities and problems general to the industry.'' The quotationsare from the September 17, 1979, <T4>Federal Register</T4>.When Ohio originally incorporated CTG recommendations into its SIP, itdid not conduct any case-by-case analysis of the feasibility or reasonablenessof those limits as applied to Lordstown. It undertook such an analysisfor the first time in response to General Motors' request for the varianceshere at issue. Based on that analysis it concluded that the CTG recommendationwas not RACT ``for the particular sources being regulated'' and submittedextensive justification to support this determination. USEPA may not properlyrely on decade-old ``past Agency analyses'' of ``capabilities and problems* * * general to the industry'' as a basis for disapproving the resultingstate-issued variances. It must deal directly with capabilities and problemsof these particular sources at this particular point in time. To do otherwiseis to arbitrarily ignore the express limitations on the ``past Agency analyses''at issue and on the uses to which those analyses were intended to be put.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>As stated in the February 9, 1987, TSD, ``USEPA has never considered a5.2 lbs VOC/gallon, 27 percent DL coating as RACT for automotive topcoats.USEPA's October 20, 1981, policy (46 FR 51386) on automotive coatings providesfor compliance date extensions through 1987, and not permanent relaxations,for topcoats.''Both USEPA's past guidance on RACT for automotive topcoat operations (theCTG document for automotive coatings) and current guidance (the May 25,1988, document titled ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies,and Deviations'') present RACT for automotive topcoat operations to be2.8 lbs VOC/gallon of coating. USEPA is not aware of having approved apermanent limit of 5.2 lbs VOC/gallon as RACT for automotive topcoat operations.Neither Ohio nor GM have presented any cases in which USEPA has approved5.2 lbs VOC/gallon as RACT for automotive topcoats. If Ohio's positionis that GM Lordstown's topcoat operation is different from all other topcoatoperations required to meet a limit equivalent to 2.8 lbs VOC/gallon at30 percent transfer efficiency, or less than 5.2 lbs VOC/gallon, it hasnot demonstrated this position. This is the fundamental test that mustbe met to obtain a permanent relaxation substantially less stringent thanwhat is generally required.USEPA agrees with GM that a case-by-case evaluation of RACT is appropriate.However, neither Ohio nor GM has presented information which justifiesapproving a permanent topcoat limit relaxation for Lordstown which is lessstringent than topcoat limits that have been established at other automotiveplants. Furthermore, GM has converted its paint shop and is likely usingcoatings equivalent to 2.8 lbs per gallon at 30 percent TE or at leastcoatings with a VOC content lower than 5.2 lbs/gallon. There does not appearto be a reasonable basis for approving a permanent relaxation from a limitwhich is possibly being met (considering transfer efficiency).<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>EPA Statement:</T3> EAB's annualization Techniques Resulted In a Systematic19 Percent Reduction In GM's Annualized costs.

Demonstrating those inaccuracies,however, requires an understanding of the history of General Motors' PaintPlan and of the implementation of that plan over the last ten years. GM provided a background before discussing ``the factual inaccuracies inUSEPA's assertions regarding the Yellow Book and General Motor's commitments.''First, General Motors did not receive a compliance date extension on October31, 1980. The December 31, 1985, compliance date was the original compliancedate established by the State and approved by USEPA. The fact that thisdate was three years beyond the attainment date approved in the SIP doesnot make it an extension. Since that Ohio SIP demonstrated that the emissionreductions at Lordstown were not necessary to ensure either attainmentof the NAAQS or reasonable further progress in the interim, the State wasfree to establish any compliance date it saw fit. Moreover, as discussedabove, USEPA expressly determined in 1979, that the facts even as theythen existed made the deadlines incorporated into General Motors ``YellowBook'' as expeditious as practicable. Thus, the December 31, 1985, datewould not have been an extension even if the reductions had been necessaryto attainment. See CAA section 172(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7502(a)(2). Second, General Motors did not include cost-effectiveness calculations,either generic or plant specific, in the ``Yellow Book''. Obviously, therefore,General Motors did not later revise its baseline for determining cost-effectiveness.No such baseline was ever established. Third, the Yellow Book constituted a commitment by General Motors to meetthe broad goal of achieving waterborne equivalence at all of its assemblyplants by 1987, and correlative commitments by EPA to: (1) Work with GeneralMotors to develop a workable schedule by which that goal could be achieved,and (2) to manage the changes in that schedule that were expected to resultas economic and air quality conditions changed and as the technology necessaryfor achieving the goal was developed. It unequivocally was not a commitmentto any particular control strategy or baseline for judging cost-effectiveness.Finally, there is USEPA's assertion that General Motors should have used17 percent DL, rather than 27 percent DL, as its baseline for determiningcost effectiveness. This assertion is inconsistent with the rationale usedto support it. USEPA and General Motors contemplated, in 1978, that theprogression from 17 percent DL to waterborne equivalence at Lordstown wouldinvolve two distinct steps. First, the plant would be converted to 27 percentlacquers, since this would produce large emission reductions without thesubstantial facility impacts that were anticipated to be necessary forfull waterborne equivalence. Second, the plant would achieve waterborneequivalence by means which had not yet been determined. It is the secondstep which is now at issue. Since the question is whether General Motorscan reasonably go beyond 27 percent lacquer, 27 percent lacquer is theonly proper baseline for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the changesnecessary to achieve that step. In addition, USEPA's assertion that 17 percent DL should have been usedas the baseline is inconsistent with USEPA's own practice. The same February7, 1986, EAB memo which identifies the 19 percent difference in annualizationtechnique results also specifically notes that the costs and cost-effectivenessratios it was analyzing were incremental costs (i.e., were the costs ofgoing beyond the controls required by the variance). At no point does EABsuggest that this approach is inappropriate. To the contrary, EAB specificallyconcluded that ``GM's costing procedures are appropriate,'' and that ``[t]hecapital and operating cost estimates prepared by GM are acceptable forthis specific application.'' Moreover, when this issue was first raised by the State of Ohio, Mr. DavidAldorfer of General Motors contacted Mr. John Calcagni, the principal authorof the February 7, 1986, EAB memo, to inquire as to USEPA's position onthis issue. Mr. Calcagni confirmed that incremental cost-effectivenesswas the appropriate metric for judging RACT In USEPA's view. This point is confirmed by USEPA's rulemaking on NSPS for the MagneticTape Manufacturing Industry. 51 FR 2996 (January 22, 1986). In that rulemaking,USEPA expressly found costs in excess of $1200/[Megagram] Mg ($1088/ton)to be unreasonable:<ITAG tagnum="21">This [$1200/Mg] value is in the upper end of the range of cost-effectivevalues that USEPA is currently using to make decisions on appropriate levelsof nontoxic VOC emissions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>Id.</T3> at 3014. Moreover, USEPA specifically confirmed that, when evaluating cost effectivenessin relation to this cutoff, each stage of an increasingly stringent seriesof ``layered'' controls is to be evaluated separately, with the appropriatelevel of control being determined by reference to the incremental costof the last ``layer.'' The claim that General Motors should have used average cost-effectivenessfrom a 17 percent baseline is also inconsistent with sound economic theory.There are distinct capital costs associated with converting from 17 percentDL to 27 percent DL based on well-defined changes needed in mechanicalcomponents of the system such as pumps, filters, and oven time. There areother and entirely distinct capital costs associated with application ofcontrol devices to the resulting exhaust streams. Finally as with the differences in annualization techniques discussed above,the differences between 17 percent and 27 percent DL baseline is not sufficientto change the essential conclusion. As Ohio EPA found, the cost-effectivenessof the controls required for compliance with OAC 3745-21-09(C) would be$5,700/ton even from a 17 percent DL baseline. Fact Sheet at 7. This isfar in excess of USEPA's own estimates of the upper limits for reasonableVOC controls. <ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response </ITAG>The following responses are generally in the same order as the above comments.GM is correct in its statement that the December 31, 1985, compliance dateis the original compliance date established by Ohio and approved by USEPA.However, the March 10, 1980, NPR (45 FR 15206), in its discussion of OAC3745-21-04 states ``For certain specific sources this regulation providesfor an extension of the applicable final compliance date listed above.''The final compliance date for GM Lordstown is December 31, 1985. This isan extension past December 1, 1982, which is the final compliance datefor Ohio's automotive, light duty truck surface coating regulation. USEPAdisagrees with GM's use of 27 percent DL as the baseline from which toevaluate cost-effectiveness. It is immaterial whether this constitutesa revision to GM's baseline or whether GM is using an inappropriate baseline.GM's (11-1-78) Yellow Book contains its initial plan to comply with USEPA'sRACT requirements for automotive coatings. Ohio's automotive coating RACTrules were adopted in 1979. GM Lordstown was using 17 percent volume solidsdispersion lacquer as of the date of the Yellow Book and adoption of Ohio'sautocoating rule. The level of control during this period (which is 17percent DL) is, therefore, the appropriate baseline for evaluating cost-effectiveness.The subsequent implementation of any partial control measures (e.g., conversionto 27 percent DL) does not constitute a valid argument for the economicinfeasibility of achieving compliance with an emission limit previouslyestablished as RACT. There is no record of USEPA informing GM that conversion to 27 percentDL is an acceptable substitute for achieving final compliance with 2.8lbs VOC/gallon at 30 percent TE. In fact, USEPA's October 31, 1980, noticeof final rulemaking (45 FR 72122) approves a December 31, 1985, final compliancedate with no requirement for an interim conversion to 27 percent DL. The February 7, 1986, EAB memo does not address the issue of whether 17percent DL or 27 percent DL is the appropriate baseline. GM has not sufficientlydocumented the communication between Mr. Calcagni and Mr. Aldorfer to enablea response to exactly what Mr. Calcagni confirmed. USEPA has not established that cost-effectiveness cutoffs for NSPS, andthe method for determining cost-effectiveness values, are appropriate forRACT determinations. Establishing the appropriate baseline for determining cost-effectivenessdoes not necessarily consider the costs involved in going from an interimto a more stringent level of control. USEPA, therefore, disagrees withwhat GM believes to be sound economic theory. The issue of 17 percent DLvs 27 percent DL baseline is not the sole basis of USEPA's proposed disapproval.USEPA agrees with the position stated by Ohio in its August 13, 1986, letterto GM. Ohio EPA states ``The use of incremental cost-effectiveness wouldpromote variances by allowing entities to employ marginally unacceptablecontrol technology or only go part way in achieving compliance with anapplicable emission limitation, and then argue that to achieve full complianceis not cost-effective.''<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>EPA Statement: </T3>OEPA's analysis indicated that certain combinationsof control measures, considered by OEPA to result in emission reductionsequivalent to RACT, were reasonably cost effective.</ITAG>This statement is apparently based on Ohio EPA's analysis of a bubble optionconsidered by General Motors involving (in addition to the controls requiredby the variance): (1) Carbon adsorption on 15 stack pairs in the main colorspray booth, (2) conversion of the deadener operation to a waterborne material,and (3) conversion of the prime operation to a ``super hi-solids'' waterbornematerial.Ohio EPA determined that the average cost effectiveness of this approach,from a 17 percent baseline, was approximately $2700/ton. USEPA concludedthat this analysis ``supports the reasonableness of at least controllingthe 15 stack pairs.'' USEPA TSD at 6.The emission reductions achieved by application of carbon adsorption to15 stack pairs are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the existingSIP. Thus, this option provides no support for USEPA's conclusion thatthe existing limit is RACT. To the contrary, since this is the only optionwhich USEPA appears to consider reasonable, USEPA apparently concedes thatthe existing limit is not RACT.Moreover, USEPA's conclusion that this option is reasonable is entirelydependent on the assumption that it has a cost-effectiveness of $2700/ton.This $2700 figure substantially understates the actual cost-effectivenessby analyzing only the average costs from a 17 percent baseline. As discussedabove, this is improper. The actual cost-effectiveness of installing carbonadsorption on 15 stack pairs is over $8,000/ton of coating VOC removed,even if annualized in accordance with USEPA's technique. GM TSD at 26.In no sense can such costs be said to reflect ``reasonably available controls.''Finally, Ohio EPA concluded that even the $2700/ton cost figure was unreasonable:``[t]he overall cost effectiveness values * * * for compliance via a RACTequivalent bubble (i.e., $2700/ton [on a 17 percent baseline] and $6600/ton[on a 27 percent baseline]) <T3>are well above the levels used by EPA in defining RACT for variousVOC source categories.'' </T3>Fact Sheet at 8 (emphasis added). USEPA citesno basis for its contrary conclusion. Indeed, as indicated above, thisposition is directly contrary to USEPA's own conclusion that $1200/Mg ($1088/ton)represents the upper limit of the range of values used by USEPA in determiningreasonable VOC control, even in the context of NSPS. The costs in questionhere are more than double this upper limit.EPA may not simply reject a state determination that $2700/ton representsan unreasonable cost absent some statement of basis for that rejection.There is no indication whatsoever of such a basis in the record here. Ifthere is any published rule, guidance, or policy upon which USEPA is relyingin this regard, General Motors is entitled to notice of, and an opportunityto comment on, that rule, guidance, or policy. If not, USEPA is requiredto defer to the State's judgment in this regard.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>The automotive coating limits, which currently apply to GM Lordstown, havebeen adopted by Ohio EPA and approved by USEPA as constituting RACT. Inorder to obtain a permanent relaxation from any of these limits, a demonstrationmust be made by Ohio EPA/GM that the existing limitation(s) are not RACTand that the limit being proposed constitutes the lowest emission limitthat is capable of being met by the application of control technology thatis reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.The quote by GM from page 6 of USEPA's TSD, ``Supports the reasonablenessof <T3>at least </T3>controlling the 15 stack pairs, ``(emphasis added) doesnot limit RACT to that control option. Rather, the statement comments ona potential control option (raised by Ohio EPA) that has not been adequatleydocumented to not constitute RACT.The issue of incremental cost-effectiveness, which is brought up againby GM, was discussed as part of the prior comment.An adequate basis has not been provided for dismissing control strategieswith a $2700/ton cost-effectiveness as economically infeasible. USEPA hasneither established cost-effectiveness cutoffs for assessing economic feasibilityfor RACT determinations nor determined that NSPS economic feasibility considerationsare appropriate for RACT determinations.<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>EPA Statement: </T3>GM failed to investigate the option of continuingto use a 17 percent solids DL with add on spray booth controls, which couldresult in VOC emission levels significantly less than current topcoat emissions.</ITAG>This statement is wrong. General Motors specifically addressed the optionof continuing to use 17 percent DL with add-on spray booth controls ina letter submitted to Ohio EPA On June 4, 1986. This letter was submittedto both Region V and OAQPS under cover letters from Mr. Aldorfer datedJune 11, 1986. Record Item E272-1. As stated in that letter, and as demonstratedby the information in the variance application itself, this alternativemakes neither economic nor environmental sense.In its TSD, USEPA observes that, on 17 percent lacquer, carbon adsorptionand incineration controls on the main color spray booth would result inan emissions level 382 tons per year below that authorized by the variance.USEPA TSD at 3, 6. What it fails to note, however, is that this alternativewould cost an additional $7.5 million dollars per year. Thus, each of these382 tons would cost over $19,500 to remove. This can hardly be describedas ``reasonable'' control.For any given level of control, it is invariably more cost-effective toconvert to 27 percent lacquer than to stay on 17 percent lacquer and employmore add-on controls. Conversely, for any given level of investment, moreemission reductions are achieved by spending those dollars first on a 27percent lacquer conversion. Thus, common sense as well as sound economicand environmental policy dictate that this be the first step in any ``reasonable''control plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>GM's comment appears wrong. The $19,500 per ton removal cost is clearlycontradicted by the $3,839 per ton, for 1st color booth control, in TableIII of GM's June 4, 1986, letter. Presumably, the $19,500 per ton is basedupon a 27 percent DL baseline. However, the point of USEPA's comment isthat use of 17 percent DL, and 1st color booth and over controls, wouldresult in 382 tons/yr less VOC emissions than the level of control in effectat the time of the submittal.USEPA agrees with what appears to be GM's point, which is that it is cheaperto obtain reductions by conversion to 27 percent DL than by use of add-oncontrols. However, it appears that use of 27 percent DL and 1st color ovencontrols results in greater VOC emissions than use of 17 percent DL and1st color spray booth and oven controls. It should be noted that GM isusing spray booth control. GM's Arlington, Texas, plant, which uses 17percent DL topcoats, controls VOC emissions from its 1st color spray boothwith an incinerator. Also, refer to USEPA's response to Ohio EPA's commentNo. 5. <ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>EPA Statement: </T3>OEPA determined that the use of air cascading forthree stack pairs would lower GM's cost effectiveness by approximately20 percent.</ITAG>This statement has been taken out of context and is misleading. Ohio EPAdid determine that the air cascading would reduce costs for the three stackpairs in question. This option, however, is far short of SIP-equivalentemission limitations and involves costs far in excess of any reasonablemeasure of RACT, even with the 20 percent reduction. See April 15, 1986,letter from David Aldorfer to James Berry Re: ``Spraybooth Air Staging''with attached ``VOC Abatement Cost Analysis With Air Cascading for BOCgroup Lordstown Assembly Plant'' dated March 1986. Further, Ohio did not conclude that this 20 percent cost saving could begeneralized beyond the three stack pairs at issue. Nor is there any rationalbasis for such a conclusion by USEPA. These three zones were intentionallyselected to provide a ``best-case'' example for air cascading, i.e., todemonstrate the maximum cost saving that could be achieved through aircascading. They are the three richest zones in the booth, they are contiguous,and the two zones into which the air would be cascaded have no people workinginside them. Further, as detailed in the above cited letter and study,the very substantial adverse impacts that air cascading might have on operationof the spray booth were not considered. The point of the study was that even with these advantages, which are duplicatednowhere else in the paint line, and without considering the costs of adverseimpacts on processing, air staging still reduced costs by only 20 percent,far short of what was needed to make add-on controls reasonably cost-effective.In short, the results of this study demonstrated, as OEPA concluded, thatthe potential cost savings from air cascading were not significant enoughto undermine the basic conclusion that carbon adsorption costs were farhigher than any accepted cut-offs for reasonably available control technology.Fact Sheet at 6. For a more detailed discussion of this point, as wellas others relating to General Motors' investigations of air managementtechniques, see the April 2, 1987, letter from David Aldorfer to Joe Paisie,Re: ``12/19/86 Memorandum from J.

This is not a nonattainment area. There have been no violationsof the NAAQS for six years, and the ``expected exceedance rate'' has beenless than 1 for each three year period since the end of 1981 (1982-84,1983-85, 1984-86, 1985-87). Further, actual emission reductions achieved in the area exceed those necessaryfor attainment under the federally approved SIP by over 9,000 tons peryear. USEPA TSD at 7. Second, this assertion begs the question at issue. Ohio EPA has determinedthat the variances are RACT; the variances thus result in no emissionsabove RACT allowable.

The December 19, 1986, memorandum consists of a series of speculative,unfounded, and unjustified criticisms of General Motors costs estimates.The conclusions expressed, moreover, have as their only basis a letterevaluating a control system that would not produce SIP-equivalent emissionreductions by a vendor who has, in the past, underestimated the costs of,and overestimated the degree of control achieved by, systems he has soldto General Motors. <T3>See </T3>May 10, 1988, letter from David Aldorfer to Gerald Emison,Director OAQPS.

The Fact Sheet makes clear that their purpose was to provideinterim relief until such time as it became feasible for General Motorsto convert to BC/CC. That time has now come and gone, 5 years earlier thanGeneral Motors or Ohio EPA originally anticipated, and the conversion hasin fact been made. Under such circumstances, it would be a triumph of formover substance for USEPA to disapprove the variances on the grounds thatthey are permanent relaxations.Alternatively, if USEPA determines it is unable to approve the variancesas temporary SIP revisions without a date certain incorporated therein,it should, at a minimum notify the State that the SIP revision would beapprovable if it were revised to incorporate a December 31, 1987, compliancedate and provide the State with a reasonable opportunity to modify thevariances accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>USEPA cannot approve the proposed SIP revision as a 2-year extension becauseit is not a 2-year extension. Ohio has had the opportunity to modify thevariances. <ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">IV. Defects in the administrative record and substantial indicia ofagency bias preclude disapproval of this variance request. A. Omissionsfrom the record deprive the proposal of its rational basis and depriveGeneral Motors of its right to an opportunity for meaningful comment.</ITAG>The Agency record for this proposal is incomplete. By far, the most importantof these omissions is the April 1987 letter from David Aldorfer to J. Paisieof Region V, responding to the December 19, 1986, EAB memo referred toin the proposal. This letter responds directly to a number of the pointson which USEPA relies in its proposed disapproval, and it has been in USEPA'spossession for over a year. Yet, it is ignored by USEPA. This omission,and USEPA's consequent failure to consider and respond to the points raisedby General Motors in that letter, undermine the rational basis for theproposal. Further, it deprives General Motors of any meaningful opportunityto comment on USEPA's view or evaluation of those points.This is not, however, the only document missing from the record. Thereis, for instance, no information in the record on the air quality in theYoungstown area, on the area's attainment status, or on the status of theState's request for redesignation. For the reasons set forth above, thisinformation is clearly relevant. Indeed, USEPA admits as much in the TSD.Further, the record does not contain the federally appoved Ohio SIP, theRFP and attainment demonstrations, or any information on the State's ``reasonablefurther progress'' demonstrations. Again, this is information which isin USEPA's possession and which unquestionably should have been consideredin reaching the conclusions expressed in the proposal.Nor does the record contain any information on USEPA's criteria for reviewingsite-specific RACT variances or for determining appropriate cost-effectivenesscut-offs. Yet, USEPA concludes that at least one option considered by OhioEPA is reasonably cost-effective notwithstanding a directly contrary conclusionby the State.Finally, with the exception of the two EAB memos cited in the proposal,the record contains no documents reflecting the substantial intra-agencycommunications which occurred regarding this variance. These communicationsunquestionably played a significant role in shaping the proposal. As such,they should be available for public comment. Moreover, due to the significantpossibility, discussed below, of agency bias in this proceeding, this omissionis crucial.USEPA is required to base its proposed actions on the complete record andto make that complete record available for public comment. It has failedto fulfill these obligations here, and until it has, it may not lawfullyor reasonably proceed to disapprove this variance.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>The Agency record in fact, is complete. The record is either containedin the sources specific revision file or located in other files availableto the general public.The April 1987 letter from David Aldorfer to Joe Paisie was not submittedto USEPA by Ohio EPA and was, therefore, not a part of the formal GM LordstownSIP submittal. However this final rulemaking does reflect considerationof the April 1987 letter.Information on the air quality in the Youngstown Area is not relevant tothis action.Information on the area's attainment status, the status of the State'srequest for redesignation, the federally approved Ohio SIP, the RFP andattainment demonstrations, the State's reasonable further progress demonstrations,and USEPA's criteria for reviewing site-specific RACT variances and fordetermining appropriate cost-effective cut-offs are not contained in theindividual site-specific rulemaking file. Policy documents utilized byUSEPA during evaluation of the revision request are referenced in the TechnicalSupport Document or the notice.With the exception of the two EAB memoranda cited in the proposed rulemakingnotice, the record contains no documents reflecting substantial intra-Agencycommunication regarding the variances because no such documents exist.<ITAG tagnum="81">GM Comment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. There is a substantial basis for believing that agency considerationof these variances has been biased by an improper mixture of its programand enforcement functions. USEPA must, at a minimum, open these contactsto public scrutiny.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response. </ITAG>There is no basis for GM's belief that the USEPA improperly mixed its programand enforcement functions in the rulemaking on this SIP revision request.It is well settled that a polluter is subject to the existing requirementsof a SIP until the polluter obtains a variance and such variance is approvedby both the State and the U.S. USEPA. <T3>Train</T3> v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> (``NRDC''), 421 U.S. 60, 92(1975); <T3>see also Duquesne Light Co.</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 698 F.2d 456, 471 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (the current SIP remainsin force until USEPA formally approves a revision); <T3>NRDC</T3> v.<T3> EPA,</T3> 507 F.2d 905, 915 (9th Cir. 1974). Accordingly, the UnitedStates initiated a civil action under the Clean Air Act to address GM'sviolations of the emission limitations of the federally-approved and enforceableOhio SIP.Moreover, no conflict of interest arose when the Agency initiated its enforcementaction on August 1986, by issuing a Notice of Violation (``NOV'') to GMfor its failure to comply with the SIP by the statutory compliance dateof December 31, 1985. GM did not file a SIP revision request until October21, 1986, ten months after the compliance date and several months afterthe NOV was issued.Coincidentally, the same date which GM had requested for (and was granted)a settlement conference (October 21, 1986) with the Agency's enforcementbranch to resolve the allegations in the NOV, was the same date the Agency'srulemaking branch received the SIP revision request for GM. The Agency'senforcement branch, however, proceeded with its action against GM due toGM's failure to propose an expeditious compliance plan in settlement negotiations.Additionally, the Agency's enforcement branch is not prohibited from havingaccess to or knowledge of the SIP revision request documents filed on behalfof GM, even if GM is a defendant in a separate enforcement action. Anyinvolvement by enforcement personnel with the SIP revision documents wasinevitable here, in order for counsel to respond to GM's extensive discoveryrequests for identification and production of documents in the SIP revisionfiles and in order to respond to the Court's inquiries during status conferencesin the judicial action. Enforcement personnel's access to, knowledge of,and familiarity with the documents in the docket files is not only normaland acceptable, but sound legal practice.<T3> See United States</T3> v.<T3> National Steel Corp.</T3> 767 F.2d 1176, 1182 (1975). The Agency'senforcement personnel, however, had no role in the rulemaking decisionof the rulemaking branch on the SIP revision request for GM. This rulemakingdecision has been completely independent of the enforcement action, inkeeping with the spirit and letter of the law as expressed by the Courtin <T3>Bethlehem Steel </T3>v. <T3>U.S. EPA,</T3> 638 F.2d 994 (7th Cir. 1980).Furthermore, any enforcement action taken against GM's Lordstown, Ohio,facility was initiated at the Regional level and not as a result of actionsby OAQPS. The USEPA, Region V, Air Compliance Branch, determined that GM'sLordstown facility was violating the Ohio SIP based on reports from theOhio EPA. Any policy prepared by OAQPS directed at automobile surface coatingoperations was national in scope, and had no impact on Region V's enforcementinitiative against GM's Lordstown facility. OAQPS played no role in theenforcement action against GM's Lordstown facility and play a minimum rolein reviewing Region V's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the SIP revisionrequest involved here. Therefore, there has been no improper mixture ofthe rulemaking (program) and enforcement functions by OAQPS in the rulemakingon this SIP revision request.Because the USEPA, in response to GM's discovery requests in the judicialaction, has disclosed the identity of the persons involved in the Agency'sreview of this SIP revision request, and has produced all non-privilegeddocuments relating to the Agency's review, there is no need for the Agencyto re-identify or reproduce such data to GM. GM has had an adequate opportunityto comment on the above data, which was either produced to GM in responseto discovery on October 21, 1987, or has been made available for inspectionsince at least that date.<ITAG tagnum="84">GM Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons stated above, the variances at issue here should be approvedas written. USEPA itself has determined that they will not interfere withattainment or maintenance of the NAAQS. This finding alone requires approval,whether or not the variances require RACT. Moreover, USEPA has failed toarticulate any rational basis for rejecting the State's conclusion thatthe variance do require RACT. The ``faults'' it finds in the State's analysisare in many cases wrong and in others misleading. And, to the extent theyare accurate, they do not undermine the basic conclusion that controlsbeyond those required by the variance are not reasonably cost-effective.At a minimum, however, the Agency should approve the variances as a two-yearextension, with interim RACT determinations pending development of methodsfor converting to BC/CC without a major reconstruction. Such approval isjustified by the facts and by the Agency's 1981 policy on topcoat complianceextensions. If a date certain must be incorporated into the variances tojustify that approval, USEPA should notify the State of that fact and providethe State with a reasonable opportunity to amend its submission.<ITAG tagnum="81">USEPA Response</ITAG>These issues have been previously addressed. USEPA conclusions are as follows:1. GM Lordstown is located in an ozone nonattainment area and RACT is,therefore, required. The redesignation request for Mahoning and Trumbullcounties is a separate action and USEPA has not yet acted on this request.2. Ohio EPA/GM have not demonstrated that GM Lordstown's car plant is substantiallydifferent from other autocoating facilities which are subject to more stringentlimits than are contained in GM's variance. The uniqueness of a facility,as compared to others in the same category, is a primary criteria in evaluatinga proposed redefinition of RACT.3. Ohio EPA/GM have requested a permanent relaxation from limits whichit may be currently achieving. On page 45 of its comments, GM states thatit has fulfilled its commitment to convert GM Lordstown to a waterborneequivalent base coat/clear coat technology. There is no apparent basisfor approving a relaxation from a limit which is being met. If GM Lordstownhas not totally achieved waterborne equivalence, it is clearly doing betterthan the limits proposed in its variance.4. Ohio EPA/GM have not established, based upon its cost-effectivenessevaluation, that its proposal represents the most stringent (consideringeconomic feasibility) limit capable of being met by GM Lordstown. USEPAhas not established cost-effectiveness cutoffs for determining whetheror not a specific control strategy constitutes RACT and the method of establishingNew Source Performance Standards is not applicable for establishing RACT.It is Ohio's burden to demonstrate both that the existing SIP limit isnot feasible and also that there is no other feasible limit more stringentthat what is contained in GM's variance. This claim of infeasibility hasnot been adequately documented particularly in light of the fact that complyingcoating systems are available, booth incineration is in use by GM (includingat its Arlington, Texas, plant), and spray booth recirculation is beingused by automotive manufacturers outside the United States and is plannedfor use within the United States.5. USEPA disagrees with the use of 27 percent DL as the baseline for evaluatingcost-effectiveness. GM Lordstown was using 17 percent DL as of the dateof GM's Yellow Book and adoption of Ohio's autocoating rule. The levelof control during this period is, therefore, the appropriate baseline forevaluating cost-effectiveness. The subsequent implementation of any partialcontrol measures (e.g., conversion to 27 percent DL) does not constitutea valid argument for the economic infeasibility of achieving compliancewith an emission limit previously established as RACT. As stated by Ohioin its August 13, 1986, letter to GM, ``[t]he use of incremental cost-effectivenesswould promote variances by allowing entities to employ marginally unacceptablecontrol technology or only go part way in achieving compliance with anapplicable emission limitation and then argue that to achieve full complianceis not cost-effective.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>Based upon a review of the SIP revision request and the public commentsraised on behalf of General Motors' Lordstown auto assembly plant in Warren,Ohio, USEPA is taking final action to disapprove this SIP revision as notconstituting RACT, as required by the CAA. USEPA is not evaluating themerits of this proposal as a temporary relaxation, because it was submittedas a permanent relaxation. However, USEPA will evaluate any compliancedate extension which is submitted for approval.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. This actionis not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by August 28, 1989.
