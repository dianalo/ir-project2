Thierry Tribolet, Red Cross relief department chief, saidWednesday that his organization helped 24,000 families in at least12 of country's 73 provinces last year.   He said Mindanao, the archipelago nation's second largestisland, accounted for about 100,000 evacuees, with the rest onLuzon and in the central Visayas island chain.   Field reports indicate most of the civilians flee when themilitary launches operations to flush out communist New People'sArmy guerrillas, Tribolet said.
