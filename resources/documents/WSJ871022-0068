Laffer</HL><DD> 10/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><TEXT>   The wild gyrations of the Dow Jones index have made us all once again aware that the economy remains vulnerable to the public policies emanating from Washington. The basis for these disturbances is ill-conceived monetary policy.    Over the past year or so, there has been a consensus that Federal Reserve policy has been tight -- that the Fed has restricted the supply of money available to the private sector. As a result, interest rates have risen, and the economy is being slowed. Those who maintain that the Fed has been unduly tight point to the slowing of the growth rates of monetary aggregates such as M1 during 1987. This is false.    To judge monetary policy, it's necessary to watch not only aggregates such as M1, but also the monetary base, which is currency plus bank reserves and thus much more directly under central-bank control. In particular, the relation between the base and M1 shows how the demand for money is changing. This indicator is flashing disturbing inflationary signals once again. Since July, the growth rate of the base has increased steadily. The recent acceleration of the growth of the base relative to M1 has been accompanied by another crisis in financial markets.    The weakened monetary policy provided an environment vulnerable to any precipitous confidence-shaking event, such as Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's anti-wealth tax proposals or Treasury Secretary James Baker's badmouthing of the dollar.    The current crisis is similar to what happened last April. Then, the dollar was in a free fall; it declined 3.5% against the Japanese yen. Similarly, short-term interest rates increased 15 basis points while long-term rates increased 88 basis points. Furthermore, the differences between long-term interest rates in the U.S. and other countries widened. During the flare-up of inflation indicators in April, the Fed announced its intention to defend the dollar. The &quot;snugging up&quot; worked for a time, arresting the dollar's collapse and the deterioration in the bond market.    While it is true that the dollar has not deteriorated as much recently as it did earlier this year, this is largely explained by foreign central-bank intervention to support the dollar. However, foreign action to support a dollar weakened by mounting U.S. inflationary pressures implies that other countries will inflate along with the U.S.    It's important to remember that the quantity of money is determined by the interaction of the demand for and supply of money, so the Federal Reserve can at most influence it -- not control it. Knowledge about changes in the quantity alone is not sufficient to know whether the price level will rise or fall. If the increase in the quantity of money is the result of a shift in the demand for money, then this should lower inflation, lower interest rates, and raise the value of the currency in the foreign exchanges. Conversely, if the increase in quantity is the consequence of a shift in supply, then inflationary pressure should be heightened, resulting in higher interest rates and a weaker currency.    All in all, no one can say that increases or decreases in the quantity of money are inflationary or deflationary, or whether the policies that precipitated these changes were loose or tight. Knowledge of the origins of the disturbance -- i.e., whether it was the demand curve or supply curve that shifted -- is necessary to determine the impact.    In a crude sense, the growth rate of the base may be viewed as a proxy for the growth rate of the supply of money, and the growth rate of M1 may be viewed as a proxy for the growth of money demand. When the base grows more rapidly than M1, this suggests that the Fed is pushing money into the financial system at a rate in excess of the growth in money demand. Such easing serves to increase inflationary pressures.    Based upon the difference between the growth rates of the monetary base and M1, the Fed in recent months has been extremely loose -- not tight. Since February, the base has been growing far more rapidly than money demand.    How this looseness came about is irrelevant to the outcome, but it is instructive. With the full tax-rate reductions having been delayed until Jan. 1, 1988, people and businesses are shifting income and income realization out of 1987 and into 1988. As a consequence, the demand for money has fallen sharply. Whether money demand falls or supply increases, the effects are the same -- higher interest rates, a weak currency and heightened inflationary expectations. In an economic environment such as today's, loose money will yield higher long-term interest rates concomitant with a weak currency. &quot;Tight&quot; is synonymous with lower long-term interest rates and a strong dollar.    To grasp this point intuitively, imagine what interest rates and the foreign exchanges would look like if everyone knew that there would never be dollar inflation again -- guaranteed. Interest rates would be a lot lower, and the dollar would be a great deal stronger.    The correct policy response now is to slow the growth of the base relative to M1. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: a slowdown of the growth in the monetary base or an increase in the growth of money demand.    The dynamics of tax reform point to a strong 1988. We expect money demand to increase steadily throughout the rest of this year in anticipation of this expansion. Although this alone may be sufficient to eliminate this excess supply of money, gradual action on the part of the Fed will only postpone the peak and subsequent decline in interest rates. To bring about a faster resolution of the current crisis, a slowdown in the growth of the monetary base is required. The first sign of such action will be a commitment by the Fed, not U.S. trading partners, to defend the dollar.    Since 1982, the Fed has deemphasized stabilizing the growth rate of money. It has chosen instead to monitor various indicators of economic activity and inflation, including sensitive commodity prices. The decline in interest rates, the rise in equity values, and the fall in the relative price of gold that coincided with this policy change are remarkable. The economy in 1983 and 1984 posted the strongest expansion since 1951. Yet, contrary to the forecasting of many leading economists, this surge in economic growth was accompanied by lower inflation, lower interest rates, and a stronger dollar.    The current experience, however, points out the problems involved in not having an explicit price rule. It is not possible to know or forecast precisely the correct amount of money to serve the economy. Restoration of a monetary standard would provide this confidence by guaranteeing the purchasing power of the dollar. Simply put, the monetary authorities would commit themselves to provide as much or as little of the monetary base as desired at a fixed value of money. Such a commitment is the essence of a price rule for monetary policy. It ensures that the supply of money will adjust automatically to accommodate changes in the demand for money so that the price level is undisturbed.    (See related story &quot;...
