Mario Biaggi Convicted In Wedtech Scandal</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Mario Biaggi was convicted of racketeeringin a far-reaching bribery and extortion scheme used to transform atiny South Bronx machine shop into the multimillion-dollar defensecontractor known as Wedtech.   After Biaggi's conviction by a federal jury Thursday, theleadership of the House of Representatives set Sept. 7 as the datefor considering a recommendation from its Ethics Committee that itexpel the 10-term Democrat.   ``The overwhelming likelihood is that the recommendation will befollowed,'' Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said in Washington.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani called on Congress to expelBiaggi, who was convicted last year on an unrelated corruptioncharge.   ``Maybe it's time they acted,'' Giuliani told a news conference.``This congressman has been convicted of numerous felonies.''   Earlier this year, the Ethics Committee recommended Biaggi beexpelled for the earlier conviction. But the committee held offsending the resolution to the House floor until after the Wedtechtrial so Biaggi could defend himself in person.   After five days of deliberations, the jury found Biaggi and fourco-defendants guilty of turning now-defunct Wedtech Corp. into anenterprise that paid millions in bribes to public officials.   Biaggi, a city policeman from 1942 to 1965 and at one time themost decorated police officer in the country, was also convicted ofextortion and bribe-taking.   ``We're obviously disappointed, and we're going to appeal,''Biaggi, 70, said outside the courtroom. Earlier, he had complainedof chest pains and was treated in the courthouse nurses' office.   It was the second legal blow of the week for Biaggi, whose 1987conviction was upheld Monday by a federal appeals court.   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley scheduled sentencingfor Nov. 18. All six of the convicted defendants remained free onbail.   Biaggi's eldest son, Richard, 39, of Fort Lee, N.J., wasacquitted of racketeering charges but convicted of bribe taking,mail fraud and tax charges.   Also convicted of racketeering and other charges were formerBronx Borough President Stanley Simon, 58; Wedtech founder JohnMariotta, 58, of Scarsdale; former Small Business Administrationregional head Peter Neglia, 40, of Armonk; and Biaggi's former lawpartner, Bernard Ehrlich, 59, of Bedford.   A seventh defendant, former city police officer Ronald Betso,40, of Brooklyn, was acquitted on all counts.   Biaggi was convicted of all but one of the 16 counts againsthim, including conspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receivingbribes.   He faces up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts,the most serious charges. He has been sentenced to 30 months inprison for the 1987 conviction in Brooklyn for obstructing justiceand taking an illegal gratuity.   Prosecutors also sought forfeiture of millions of dollars inill-gotten gains by the five convicted of racketeering. Inaddition, Biaggi, Mariotta and Ehrlich face fines of more than $7million each.   Biaggi was convicted of extorting $50,000 in cash and stock onceworth more than $3 million from Wedtech in exchange for hispolitical clout. Biaggi also was convicted of filing falsefinancial disclosure statements and tax returns to cover up hisillegal profits.   More than 130 witnesses were called in the trial, which beganMarch 11. Four former Wedtech executives who pleaded guilty tostate and federal corruption charges and testified for thegovernment in exchange for leniency.   At the heart of the Wedtech case was how Welbilt Electronic DieCorp., a tiny machine shop Mariotta started in 1965, became amultimillion-dollar defense contractor.   Mariotta was once hailed as a ``hero for the '80s'' by PresidentReagan for hiring ex-convicts and former drug addicts in the SouthBronx, one of America's most economically depressed areas.   Prosecutors, however, charged that Wedtech was built on greed,and that Mariotta and others at Wedtech bribed Biaggi, Simon andNeglia for help with city and federal agencies.   Prosecutors charged that Ehrlich, the younger Biaggi and Betsohelped those three receive or cover up the payoffs.   However, the defense contended that the corrupt Wedtechexecutives who testified had the ear of White House insiders likeAttorney General Edwin Meese III and did not need to bribe Biaggi.   They noted that former White House aide Lyn Nofziger wasconvicted in Washington of illegal lobbying for Wedtech; that Meesewas under investigation by a special prosecutor for his Wedtechdealings; and that a close Meese friend, lawyer E. Robert Wallach,was indicted for allegedly taking Wedtech payoffs to influenceMeese and other officials.   Near the end of the trial, the special prosecutor announcedthere was insufficient evidence to charge Meese with wrongdoing,but questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues.   Prosecutors in the Wedtech trial claimed the so-called ``Meesedefense'' was a smoke screen to divert attention away from theseven defendants.</TEXT></DOC>
