The glaringexception to this rational incentive system has been the past20 years of acquiescence by Presidents to micromanagement ofgovernment by Congress beyond all reasonable bounds.Especially since the closing days of the Nixon White House,Presidents have done little to protect their constitutionalturf. As a consequence, concepts such as separation ofpowers, limited government and accountability to voters arenow weak or blurred.   These heady subjects were the theme of a fighting speechlast week by President Bush, who in effect said he's notgoing to take it anymore. Mr. Bush's announcement of hisstrategy for winning back powers and duties that belong tothe executive branch deserves some attention, especiallyafter the performance of the Commander in Chief in thePersian Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Although our Founders never envisioned a Congress thatwould churn out hundreds of thousands of pages' worth ofreports and hearings and documents and laws every year,&quot; Mr.Bush said, &quot;they did understand that legislators would try toaccumulate power.&quot; He quoted James Madison's famous warningin the Federalist Papers that &quot;the legislative department iseverywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawingall power into its impetuous vortex.&quot;   Here's some of what the vortex sucks in. &quot;For fiscal year1989 the Pentagon devoted 500 man-years and over $50 millionjust to write reports responding to congressional queries onsuch items as plans for manning tugboats and accounting forthe number of bands,&quot; Mr. Bush said. He noted that Pentagonstaffers respond to 750,000 inquiries from congressionalstaffers every year representing the 107 congressionalcommittees and subcommittees that &quot;oversee&quot; Pentagonprograms. These never-ending requests make it hard for anyoneto function, and &quot;waste the time and energy of theexecutive.&quot; They are especially a waste now that we have seenhow well all those $600 toilet seats performed against Iraq.   Mr. Bush also complained about congressional meddling intrying to mandate whom he appoints to various offices and thehabit of &quot;writing too specific directions for carrying out aparticular law.&quot; The foreign-aid bill, for example, hasbecome an international pork-barrel system where Congressmenget to &quot;earmark&quot; the most minute detail of how the $14billion program is spent. Last month, the White Houseproposed new legislation that would &quot;put an end tomicromanagement of all of our foreign economic, security andhumanitarian assistance programs.&quot;   Mr. Bush emphasized that he sees the veto as a strongweapon for fighting back not just against bills he opposes ontheir merits, but also legislation that violates theconstitutional design. He noted that &quot;six times in mypresidency I have vetoed bills that would have weakenedpresidential powers.&quot; Writing nearby, Terry Eastlanddescribes this as the presidential &quot;self-defense veto.&quot;   Mr. Bush has also declared in his signing statements thatdozens of particular provisions in bills are unconstitutionaland that he would therefore instruct his officials to ignorethem. These look like item vetoes to us, though Mr. Bushstill asked in his speech for the power to line-item veto,which he said he would use to stop such absurdities as &quot;thefederal grant to study cow belches or a Lawrence Welkmuseum.&quot; Mr. Bush pushed the item-veto debate further byreminding his audience that &quot;some believe that I already havethat power under the Constitution.&quot; But for some reason theWhite House hasn't tried a test case yet.   Mr. Bush's commitment to finding ways to correct theimbalance between the presidency and Congress is a far cryeven from Ronald Reagan, who failed to veto the infamousBoland amendments and reauthorized the special-prosecutorlaw. In addition to watching the Reagan presidency founder onthe criminalizing of policy differences known as Iran-Contra,Mr. Bush's experience as a Member of Congress during itscontinuing era of imperial overstretch must have taught himhow high the separation-of-powers stakes have become.   It is appropriate that Mr. Bush made these comments atPrinceton University, whose former president, Woodrow Wilson,wrote a classic political-science text many decades agotitled &quot;Congressional Government.&quot; A power-grabbing Congressis nothing new, but a President willing to fight back is bothnew and overdue.</TEXT></DOC>
