Displacing combustible gas mixturesfrom storage tanks or pipelines requires close consideration of flammabilitylimits of mixtures of inert and combustible gases in air, instrumentselection for gas analysis, sampling procedure, choice of inert gas,purging technique and environmental constraints. Each of these factorsis discussed from the perspective of avoiding excessive inert gas consumptionwhile maintaining a safe operation. A computerized evalutaion of gasflammability incorporating mixtures of 26 different combustible gasesor vapours with either N/sub 2/ or C0/sub 2/ as diluent, has been developedto monitor the safety hazards throughout the inerting procedure. 10 refs.,4 tabs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
