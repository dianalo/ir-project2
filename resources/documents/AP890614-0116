CharlesBennett, D-Fla., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.   Bennett initiated the proposal, along with Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa.   Last year, the House passed a proposal by the same twolegislators for a $3.5 billion cap on spending for the StrategicDefense Initiative, or SDI, as Star Wars is formally known. TheSenate and House later agreed on a spending level of $4.1 billion.   ``Many experts have told us that $3 billion is plenty forvigorous SDI research,'' Bennett said in a statement.   The research program is intended to allow policy-makers to decideby the mid-1990's whether to deploy space-based anti-missiledefenses. The Soviet Union says some proposed research would violatethe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans space-basedanti-missiles defenses.   Other Republicans joining the initiative were Reps. ChristopherShays of Connecticut, Fred Gandy of Iowa, and Bill Green and FrankHorton, both of New York.</TEXT></DOC>
