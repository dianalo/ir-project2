Dan Walker pleaded guilty to bank fraud and other charges in federal court here, following a yearlong investigation by federal authorities into his management of a suburban thrift.    Mr. Walker, 64 years old, also was charged with misapplication of bank funds and perjury for lying to federal regulators about his actions. Mr. Walker, who was chairman and president of First American Savings andamp; Loan Association, was prohibited by regulators from receiving further loans from the thrift. But he directed his son and a business associate to get loans there and &quot;funnel&quot; the money to him, the government charged.    U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas said that as part of a plea bargain, Mr. Walker has agreed to cooperate with a continuing investigation into bank fraud and other matters. Mr. Valukas wouldn't elaborate, and no others have been charged in the investigation.    The maximum penalty Mr. Walker faces is 15 years in prison, a $505,000 fine and restitution to the savings and loan in Oak Brook, Ill., which was taken over by federal regulators last year. </TEXT></DOC>
