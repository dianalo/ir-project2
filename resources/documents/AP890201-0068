European currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise tocomments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan onTuesday that current exchange rates were tolerable.   They predicted little movement until finance ministers andcentral bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations meet inWashington later this week.   ``At the moment, the dollar is trading in a very narrow range,''said a dealer at a large German bank in Frankfurt. ``I see it movinghigher very, very slowly.''   Dealers in Milan, Italy, said the market also appeared confidentthat President Bush would act to reduce the U.S. deficit.   ``This is honeymoon time for Bush and that's certainly helpingthe dollar,'' said one trader at a major European commercial bank inMilan.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,the dollar surged 1.27 yen to a closing 130.40. Later, in London, itwas quoted at 130.00 yen.
