The soybean and corn crops are vulnerable to frost damagebecause the unusually wet summer slowed their rate ofmaturity.</LP><TEXT>   Soybean prices reacted the most strongly of major Midwestcrops yesterday in part because a weekly government survey ofgrowing conditions showed that the soybean crop didn'timprove as expected in Minnesota, Nebraska and Missouri.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybeancontract for September delivery rose seven cents a bushel tosettle at $6.225 a bushel.   On Monday, soybean prices had dropped in the wake of signsthat the White House won't offer any special trade creditssoon to the Soviet Union, one of the biggest buyers of U.S.crops.   U.S. traders had been speculating that reports of breadshortages in the Soviet Union might help unlock U.S. credits.But the Bush administration wants the Soviet Union to firstclear away any hurdles that block emigration by its Jewishcitizens.   The new frost forecast also helped to slightly raiseprices of several corn futures contracts.   In a typical year, most crops have stopped developing ontheir own accord in time for a killing frost. This year,however, only 33% of the corn crop is mature, compared with anormal rate of 61%, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vicepresident at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.   Only 22% of the soybean crop has matured, compared with anormal rate of 39% by this time of the season, Mr. Lespinassesaid.   The rally was triggered by forecasts for cool and wetweather in much of the Midwest through this weekend. Such aweather pattern would continue to slow the harvest whileincreasing the chances of a frost.   Some forecasters are predicting a chance for a frost byMonday in northern sections of southern Minnesota, Iowa,Illinois and Indiana.   Most analysts expect soybean prices to be choppy until theharvest is completed. After the harvest, traders will beginto focus on the prospects for the planting of soybeans inSouth America.   According to Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain andamp;Livestock Corp., Chicago, soybean acreage may slip in SouthAmerica because budget pressures are forcing governments totrim funds to farmers. At the same time, farm expenses areincreasing in the wake of the jump in oil prices, he said.   Wheat prices fell yesterday.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: With no additional war talk out of the Middle Eastor Washington, crude oil futures prices couldn't sustainMonday's record-breaking gains, falling 22 cents a barrel inNew York Mercantile Exchange trading. Crude for Octoberdelivery fell to $33.41 a barrel on the heels of similardeclines in Europe. The October contract, which expires withtomorrow's trading, was the only crude contract showing adecline on the New York Merc. However, October and Novembergasoline registered a slight decline, as well. Traders haveexpressed some surprise at the recent relative sluggishnessin gasoline futures prices.   Perhaps some of that surprise will dissipate when tradersdigest the latest weekly report on U.S. petroleum inventoriesreleased by the American Petroleum Institute after tradingstopped yesterday. It showed a huge 5,870,000 barrel buildupin gasoline stocks for the week ended Friday. Traders andanalysts surveyed earlier by AP-Dow Jones said they thoughtgasoline inventories fell by 750,000 barrels that week.   Similarly, survey participants were substantially off intheir crude inventory estimates. The API report put U.S.crude stocks at nearly 369.8 million barrels, a decrease of4.5 million barrels. The AP-Dow Jones report said marketplayers expected a drop of 2.1 million barrels.   Only on heating oil was the survey's projection of a1,750,000-barrel increase about on target with the API's 1.6million barrel rise. Heating oil futures have exhibitedstrength in recent sessions that traders attribute to spreadtrading and firmer European prices. Yesterday, Octoberheating oil ended at 86.43 cents a gallon, up 1.12 cents.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were sharply lower despite apartial recovery from an early plunge that was triggered byweakness in London. The December contract ended with a lossof 3.75 cents a pound at $1.24, just under the day's high of$1.2450. The December contract dropped six cents a pound inearly trading to $1.2170, as traders reacted in sympathy withLondon, said John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp;Associates, copper industry consultants in New City, N.Y.&quot;There has been growing concern in London that there mightnot be enough copper to satisfy deliveries against the cashcontract on the London Metal Exchange by Thursday, which isthe day on which the contract matures,&quot; Mr. Gross said. As aresult, he said, traders who had previously sold short inanticipation that prices would go down began buying backcontracts to liquidate their positions. As a result, henoted, &quot;the spread, or the difference between the cashposition and three months {delivery} on Monday widened to theequivalent of 20 cents a pound.&quot; Yesterday, the urgency tobuy contracts by traders who previously sold short ran itscourse and the spread between the cash and three monthsdeliveries narrowed to nine cents a pound as the price of thecash contract fell sharply, according to Mr. Gross.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices declined. The October contract endedwith a loss of 0.23 cent a pound at 10.92 cents, afterrebounding from a drop to 10.75 cents, which was the day'slow and 0.40 cent below Monday's close. Traders in recentsessions have been liquidating October contracts prior to theexpiration of the contract on Sept. 28, an analyst said.Yesterday, after trading quietly most of the day, sellingdeveloped in the contract; the price decline was acceleratedby the thin market, the analyst said. Additional sellingappeared as the December price fell below 11 cents, 10.90cents and 10.80 cents, regarded as chief resistance levels,until it fell to its low and steadied. Traders ignored areport by the International Sugar Organization that estimatedthere would be a surplus of 559,000 metric tons of sugar atthe end of the current season on Aug. 31, 1991. Because thatprojection was well below the forecast of a major Londontrade firm, which last week estimated the surplus at 1.4million tons, it normally would have been a price-firmingfactor, a New York dealer said. &quot;People apparently aren'tpaying attention to fundamentals at this moment,&quot; the dealersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
