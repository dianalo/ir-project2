In the face of persistent complaints from West Germany andother allies, Secretary of State James Baker is likely to putthe proposal on the table today in Brussels during a meetingwith foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance,the officials said. The proposal also is expected to call fornegotiations with the Kremlin about eliminating nuclearartillery shells from both U.S. and Russian forces stationedin Europe.</LP><TEXT>   Once the U.S. formally proposes to kill plans forshort-range missiles to be deployed in West Germany, the ideais certain to be embraced by the rest of the allies. WestGerman officials especially have criticized the Bushadministration for proceeding with plans to field suchweapons, asserting that they no longer are necessary in lightof the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.   White House aides are considering having Mr. Bush announcethe new alliance position at a commencement speech inOklahoma tomorrow, but they may decide to go public with itearlier.   The White House may couch the move as a significant newproposal intended to show its good faith and prod the Kremlinto make similar concessions. But it has been clear for sometime that building European and congressional oppositionalmost certainly would prevent the administration fromfielding a replacement for the Lance missile in any case.   The Pentagon previously proposed spending about $500million over the next five years to develop the new weapon,and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has maintained that theU.S. shouldn't move on its own to scrap those plans. Now, theadministration appears ready to make an important symbolicgesture by announcing the new policy and embracingcongressional efforts to spend those funds elsewhere.   The administration's gambit could provide a domesticpolitical boost for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, whois likely to portray it as a sign that his sweepingarms-control proposals and other policies to improveEast-West relations are showing results. More important,NATO's willingness to forgo short-range nuclear missiles isbound to help reassure Kremlin leaders that a unified Germanywouldn't pose a military threat against Russia.   As part of any agreement covering a replacement for theLance, Pentagon officials have consistently argued that NATOshould be allowed to retain aircraft-launched missiles in itsarsenal. Because congressional opposition to such missiles isconsiderably weaker, Mr. Baker isn't likely to include themin his proposal.   ---   Gerald F. Seib contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
