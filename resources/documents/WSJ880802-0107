The aerospace giant's net income rose to $160 million, or $1.05 a share, from $117 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 35% to 4.7 billion from $3.48 billion.    The higher-than-expected earnings caused industry analysts to increase their estimates for the company's full-year performance. Howard A. Rubel of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., who had been expecting Boeing to earn about $3.85 a share, said he now expects about $4.10 a share, despite a poor showing by Boeing's military-airplane operations.    &quot;They have improved their manufacturing efficiency {in commercial aircraft} and they're doing substantially greater volume. This was a pivotal quarter,&quot; Mr. Rubel said.    A company spokesman declined to elaborate on a prepared statement that said Boeing's sales for the full year &quot;continue to be projected in the $17 billion range.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing's stock surged $2 to close yesterday at $62.50 a share.    During the quarter, Boeing booked $13.3 billion of aircraft orders, a 75% increase from the year-earlier $7.6 billion. The aircraft sold included 268 jetliners and 29 turbo-props.    In the first six months, net was $296 million, or $1.94 a share, up from $235 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $8.32 billion from$7.24 billion.    In addition to the surging orders, Boeing attributed its earnings rise to lower new-business expense in areas such as research and development, which dropped to $382 million for the first six months, compared with $399 million for the year-ago period. Boeing also cited a lower federal income tax rate and increased other income.    However, the statement also said earnings were partly offset by &quot;significant performance problems on several military programs,&quot; adding that military sales for 1988 would be &quot;slightly under&quot; last year. For the first six months, Boeing's military sales dropped $200 million to $2.4 billion, compared with a year earlier.    Analysts estimated that the company's military aircraft programs were operating at a loss, which they attributed to $50 million to $100 million in unexpected costs caused by performance and technical problems. The problems didn't surprise analysts, who have criticized Boeing for submitting unrealistically low bids to win contracts. &quot;They bit too aggressively in a tight environment,&quot; one analyst said.    Analysts said most of the problems were occurring at Boeing's military-airplane unit, based in Wichita, Kan. The programs include the re-engining of the KC-135 tanker aircraft, a re-winging of the A-6 aircraft, electronics and other equipment for the B-2 Stealth bomber, the airframe for the military communications program known as J-stars and a Strategic Defense Initiative communications aircraft, the airborne optical adjunct.    Mr. Rubel said he expected the company's military operations to recover somewhat by year-end as Boeing begins to show a profit from some military aircraft programs, such as the airborne warning and control, or AWACS, planes for the governments of France and Britain.    Boeing said it delivered 169 commercial aircraft during the first half of this year, compared with 155 last year.    The company's backlog of unfilled firm orders grew to $39.9 billion as of June 30, compared with $33.2 billion at the end of last year. About 82% of that was for commercial customers, while 18% was for U.S. government orders. Boeing doesn't include options on aircraft in its backlog figures. </TEXT></DOC>
