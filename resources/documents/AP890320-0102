SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BALTIMORE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Climate warming could mean higher cropyields in the Northern states and Canada but agricultural pests anddiseases could well follow, a Columbia University researcher saidMonday.   Cynthia Rosenzweig told the Association of American Geographersthat the effects of threatened global warming must be studied incombination, not one at a time.   For example, she said, scientists have tended to look at suchthings as temperature and rainfall and how those affect crops.Instead, she said, an overall study must be done not only of howeach change affects life but of how the changes interact.   Rosenzweig spoke at a session on global change, which focused onthe greenhouse warming of the atmosphere many scientists say couldhave serious effects on mankind.   The greenhouse theory is that carbon dioxide and other gasesreleased into the atmosphere by industrial and other processes willtrap heat from the sun, warming the planet in somewhat the same waythat a greenhouse is warmed.   Scientists speculate this could have an impact on crop growth andrainfall patterns and even could melt some of the polar ice caps andproduce a disastrous rise in sea levels.   There is disagreement over whether such a warming has alreadybegun. Most meteorologists contend that last year's hot, dry summerwas part of normal weather variability and not a result of thegreenhouse effect.   Nonetheless, scientists tend to agree that warming is likely incoming years, although the amount depends on factors not fullyunderstood.   Rosenzweig reported that she has looked at two models ofpotential climate change and found that the likely result would besmaller crop yields in the Southeast and Midwest, but increases inproduction in the Northern states and parts of Canada, largely dueto the longer growing season as the climate warms.   This warming led to increased need for irrigation in some areas,she added, and irrigation could become more cost-effective assmaller crop yields drove up prices.   In addition to better crops in the Northern areas, however, thewarmth will also allow survival of crop pests during the winter inmore northerly areas, as well as the mosquitoes and other factorsthat can spread livestock diseases, she said.   These findings illustrate the need to look at economic, medicaland other results of climate change, she said.   William E. Easterling, of the research firm Resources for theFuture Inc., told the same meeting that his company has begun astudy focusing on the gradual response to change.   Global warming will come gradually and people will seek ways toadjust to it, he said. It is necessary to start thinking about thetechnology, crop varieties and economic system that will exist 50 or75 years in the future, said Easterling, in order to plan forclimate change.   Since the 1920s, he said, the growing of hard, red winter wheathas expanded from a region focused on Kansas and Nebraska to areasextending all the way from Canada to Texas.   This happened because of improvements in the varieties of wheatavailable and in farming methods, he said.   Both Easterling and Rosenzweig stressed the need for increasedresearch on drought and on crops that can resist heat.   Rosenzweig, however, added that adjusting the type of crop grownhelps cope with change in some areas, but isn't effective in allregions.   At the same time, she said, climate change will be affecting thewhole world, not just the United States, so farmers need to keep inmind the needs of other nations and the export demand for theirproducts.</TEXT></DOC>
