But some knowledgeablepeople, among them Sam Kipp, who heads the state's Student Aid Commission,which provides grants to thousands of California students, are not so sure.;   Even if Kipp is wrong about the immediate effects of this increase, there areserious long-term questions about a university fee structure that heavilysubsidizes students, even the very rich, without providing enough financialaid to the needy. (At this point, Kipp says, the state can provide tuitiongrants for only one of every three needy applicants).;    As a consequence,the median income of the parents of University of California undergraduates,now well over $50,000, is higher than the income of the parents of students atCalifornia's private colleges, while the percentage of low-income students islower.;    In the endless dispute over the question of access for minoritystudents to the university, the more fundamental question of access forlow-income students generally is almost never raised.;    There may be reasonsfor that. For most of its existence, UC fees were regarded as negligible,which meant that the matter of financial aid was negligible as well. But forpoor families, and even for middle-income families, a total annual collegebill now approaching $10,000, counting room, board and fees, is a formidablematter. As a consequence, the basic premise needs to be re-examined. And if ahearing late in February before state Sen. Gary Hart's Senate EducationCommittee was any indication, it will be.;    The most significant idea at theSenate hearing came from Kirk Knutsen of the California Post-secondaryEducation Commission. Knutsen noted that in the six years between 1982 and1988, the number of UC students of families earning between $30,000 and$50,000 (constant dollars) actually declined by nearly 14 percent, while thenumber of students from families earning over $75,000 increased by 45 percent(to 29,000).;    He says that if California raised its charges well beyond the$650 increase approved by the regents, while providing significantly morefinancial aid to low- and middle-income students -- most of whom would paylittle or nothing more than they do now -- no one would suffer any financialhardship and the university would gain more of the revenue it needs.;   Knutsen bases his formula on what he says is the pattern in other publicuniversities, which peg student fees at roughly 33 percent of the totalper-student cost. In California, that would bring fees from their present$1,624 to $3,860. But by giving all low- and moderate-income students largechunks of aid, only those coming from families earning over $64,000 would paysignificantly more than they do now.;    As a result, the university wouldprobably lose some high-income students to private colleges, but since itwould lose no low-income students (who, unlike the rich, have no alternativebut community or state colleges), there would be no impact on access.;    Atthe same time, such a policy would help make private colleges a little morecompetitive and thus take some enrollment pressure from the public system.(And by pegging the fee as a percentage of total costs, it would also createuseful pressures on UC to hold those costs down).;    But as Knutsen pointsout, &quot;the pressures currently forcing consideration of (large) fee increasesare not one-time and are likely to recur. Unless steps are taken to lower theuniversity's long-term cost curve or dramatically increase revenues ... thestate and the university are likely to be involved in this same discussion infuture years.&quot; Which is to say that some long-term resolution -- beginningwith a significant re-examination of a lot of assumptions -- is required.;   &quot;We are approaching a crossroads in terms of our fee policy,&quot; Kipp said.Unless the whole system is restructured, every passing year can only increasethe subsidy to the rich and the squeeze on most others.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PETER SCHRAG  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  828  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075156,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
