Blair, Lands Staff, (703) 235-2160.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 16, 1989 (53 FR 39024), theForest Service adopted final policy and procedures for administering specialuse permits that authorize privately-owned recreation residences on NationalForest System lands. The policy established a new procedure for calculatingannual fees and gave direction on tenure and renewability of the permits,describing procedures to be followed when the residence site was neededfor a higher public purpose.This policy was appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture on September 15,1988. In general, the appellants alleged that the process by which thispolicy was developed was flawed in that provisions of the policy exceededstatutory limitations on recreation residence use of the National Forestsand that the appellants and the public were adversely affected by the policy.In a decision dated February 15, 1989, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculturefor Natural Resources and Environment remanded the policy to the ForestService for restudy and reformulation and stayed the implementation ofcertain provisions of the policy as follows: (1) Those nonrenewal provisionsrelating to or requiring a showing of higher public purpose; (2) thoseprovisions requiring automatic permit renewal 10 years prior to expirationunless nonrenewal has been established; (3) those provisions requiringthe offering of ``in-lieu'' lots to permittees who have received noticeof nonrenewal or termination; and (4) those provisions weighted againstconsideration of commercial uses for sites when nonrenewal of the recreationresidence use is contemplated. In addition, the Assistant Secretary requiredthat the remaining features of the final policy be designated as interimpolicy pending its reformulation following all applicable process requirements.The reformulation period was established by the decision as 18 months.The policy adopted August 16, 1988, was issued as direction to Forest Servicepersonnel through amendments and interim directives to Forest Service ManualChapters 2340 and 2720 and Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special UsesHandbook. On June 1, 1989, the Forest Service gave notice that the directionin FSM 2340 and 2720 had been revised to remove those provisions stayedby the Assistant Secretary and that the remaining portions of the policywere designated as interim policy in compliance with the Assistant Secretary'sdecision (54 FR 23499). The interim policy shall expire no later than September30, 1990.The Forest Service has begun restudy and reformulation of the overall recreationresidence policy and through this notice is seeking the advice of the publicon those portions of the adopted policy stayed by the Assistant Secretary'sdecision. Based on consideration of comments and advice received, the Agencywill publish for public review and comment a draft reformulated policyin the Fall of 1989. Following analysis of public comment on the draftpolicy, a final policy will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>with a notice of its adoption by July 1, 1990.Copies of the draft and final policy notices will be mailed to each recreationresidence permittee and to individuals and organizations known to havean interest in this policy.The public is advised that the Assistant Secretary's decision, while stayingspecific provisions of the policy, also expressed concern about other provisionsof the policy such as procedures for fee determination. These provisionswill require consideration and possible additional explanation or revisionfor clarity. These additional matters are not addressed in the notice,but will be addressed when a draft policy is published.<ITAG tagnum="84">Provisions of the Adopted Policy To Be Examined</ITAG>Those provisions of the adopted policy that have been stayed are summarizedhere along with a summary of the appellants objections and the AssistantSecretary's decision in response to the allegations.1. <T3>Higher Public Purpose. </T3>The term ``higher public purpose'' wasdefined in andSection; 41.23b of the Forest Service Handbook (FSM 2709.11)as ``a higher priority use of a site for the benefit of the general publicthat is timely, clearly needed, in public demand, and where other sitesto satisfy the need cannot reasonably be made available.'' ``Higher publicpurpose'' is further defined in the FSH 2709.11, andSection; 41.23b to ``excludeunspecified public needs or uses, such as general Forest use or open spacealone.''The appellants alleged that the definition of ``higher public purpose''was ``in direct conflict with the 1915 Terms Permit Act which specificallyrefers to natural, scenic, recreational and other aspects of the NationalForest.''The Assistant Secretary found that the policy ``improperly restricts considerationof other valid uses for the same sites'' and that ``it is improper forthe policy to discriminate against other valid uses, such as open space* * *.'' The Assistant Secretary's decision further states: ``The rigorousstandard for a finding of a `higher public purpose,' along with the detailedlist of other report criteria necessary to support nonrenewal, arbitrarilydiscriminate against other lawful uses of the forest. Permittee renewalrights should not be deemed superior to other uses, but must be found tobe consistent with other planned uses of the forest each time permittedrights are considered. Such a balanced consideration is necessary to complywith the mandate of the Act of 1915, that permitting authority be exercisedconsistent with the general public's full enjoyment of the national forest.''The term ``higher public purpose'' is used numerous times throughout theadopted policy which is set out at the end of this notice. To ensure thatreviewers recognize that the term may be revised to be less restrictivethroughout the policy, the term ``alternative public purpose'' (one oftwo optional definitions) is printed in boldface and parentheses whereverthe term ``higher public purpose'' appears in the text. This is done asa reader aid to identify all the affected provisions, not to indicate thatone term is favored over another.2. <T3>Term Permit Renewal. </T3>The policy at FSM 2347.1 directed authorizedofficers to ``Issue twenty year term permits and renew every ten yearsunless need for a higher public use at the same location has been documentedand established.'' Appellants alleged that ``The criteria for documentingand establishing higher public use are so prejudicially slanted in favorof the private use, complex and difficult that continued occupancy is allbut guaranteed'' and ``violates the 1915 Act by all but guaranteeing indefinitetenure far exceeding 30 years.''The Assistant Secretary found that the tenure-related issues raise ``concernsthat the policy goes beyond statutory limitations on period of occupancy,and improperly restricts consideration of other valid uses for the samesites.'' As stated in 1, the Assistant Secretary's decision also findsthat the ``criteria necessary to support nonrenewal arbitrarily discriminateagainst other lawful uses of the forests.''<T3>3. In-lieu Sites. </T3>The appellants alleged that the policy ``providespermittees being terminated or not renewed with in-lieu lots even to thepoint of establishing new tracts.'' The appellants further alleged that``Such in-lieu lots or new tracts are not available to anyone else'' andthat ``this policy, once again, clearly violates the intent of the 1915Act by promising indefinite tenure to private interests and denies anyother citizen equal access for whatever additional lots may become available.''The Assistant Secretary's decision stays the implementation of policy provisionsoffering in-lieu lots to permittees who have received notice of nonrenewalor termination.<T3>4. Commercial Uses.</T3> The appellants alleged that the policy provisionrequiring that commercial use must show a clear and convincing need andbear a greater burden of proof than those for other uses could ``deprivethe public of facilities need for full public enjoyment'' and that it ``discriminatesagainst commercial uses.'' The Assistant Secretary's decision finds thatthe criteria necessary to support nonrenewal arbitrarily discriminate againstother lawful uses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Public Comment</ITAG>In order for the public to consider the key provisions requiring revisionin the context of the total policy, the text of the adopted policy is beingreprinted at the conclusion of this notice. Following each affected section,possible revision options are displayed. Where multiple options are given,they appear in the following order: The first option listed would givethe Forest Service the most discretion in implementing the policy and thelast option is the minimal revision necessary to comply with statutoryauthorities.It should be noted that adoption of certain options would require conformingchanges in other parts of the policy. Because of the multiple options offered,it was not practical to show all the possible conforming changes that wouldneed to be made throughout the policy; therefore, those changes are nothighlighted in this publication.While general comments are welcome, because of the coding structure ofthe Forest Service Manual and Handbook, it is extremely important thatreviewers identify their specific comments by topic and section numberfirst and then by the itemized option within a section. For example, <T3>Administration</T3> Sec. 2721.23a, option 9A. Referring to sectionnumbers and subjects and, where appropriate, option numbers will ensurethat the Agency properly identifies the subject area being addressed andunderstands the context in which comments are made.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George M.

Recreation residences are a very important use of National Forest Systemlands. They are an important component of the overall National Forest recreationprogram and have the potential of supporting a large number of recreationperson-days. The Forest Service will work in partnership with the holdersof these permits to maximize the recreational benefits of these residences.2. Administer recreation residence special use permits to ensure properuse of the site for family and guest recreation purposes.3. Use every reasonable effort to provide in-lieu sites to holders whohave received nonrenewal or termination notices (except termination forbreach). For this purpose, sites within or adjacent to the National Forestcontaining the residences being terminated or under nonrenewal, includingundeveloped or withdrawn sites, shall be available as in-lieu sites. Newtracts may be established for recreation residence in-lieu sites at locationsnot needed in the foreseeable future for a higher public use (alternativepublic use). In-lieu sites should be comparable to the sites being recoveredwhen possible, but make sure that holders are informed that the Agencycannot guarantee that the available in-lieu sites will be entirely satisfactory.Do not establish new recreation residence tracts for any other purposethan for providing in-lieu sites (FSM 2721.23e).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 3A. </T3>Holders who have received nonrenewal or terminationnotices (except termination for breach) may be offered an in-lieu sitewhen sites are available in the same recreation tract and there is no otheruse for that site in the foreseeable future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 3B. </T3>Holders who have received nonrenewal or terminationnotices (except termination for breach) may be offered an in-lieu sitewhen sites are available in established tracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 3C. </T3>Same as the adopted policy, except revise the firstsentence to read ``In-lieu sites may be made available to holders who havereceived nonrenewal or termination notices (except termination for breach).''and in the second sentence delete ``shall'' and substitute ``may''.</ITAG>4. Although a few full-time residences are currently authorized by specialuse permit, do not approve any new authorizations for such uses, exceptin special situations to provide caretaker or other similar services wherethere is a strongly demonstrated need (FSM 2347.12).

If another need for the site has been established through the Forestplanning process or if a need for the site is to be reviewed, new permitsmay be issued, at permit expiration, for a term of less than 20 years.</ITAG>6. Give holders at least 10 years written advance notice if the use isnot to be continued, except when the permit is to be terminated when (a)it is in the public interest, particularly when the final decision authoritydoes not rest with the Forest Service, (b) there is an uncorrected breachof the permit, or (c) the site has been rendered unsafe by catastrophicevents such as flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement.

The Forest Supervisor may authorize caretaker residence in limited caseswhere it is demonstrated that caretaker services are needed for the securityof a recreation residence tract, and alternative security measures arenot feasible or reasonably available. The need for a caretaker residencerarely can be justified where yearlong occupancy is already authorizedin the tract.2. Authorize no more than one caretaker residence per recreation residencetract unless factors such as size and layout of the tract call for morethan one. The affected tract association, or if there is no association,at least 60 percent of the affected holders, must document approval ofrequest for a caretaker residence. Require the applicants for caretakeruse to document the caretaker services they will provide.3. Issue the annual permit only for an existing residence. The permit mustcontain a provision that automatically terminates authorization for yearlonguse in case of change in ownership. Do not authorize construction of anew residence for caretaker services.4. Coordinate applications for caretaker residence permits with local Governmentalagencies to avoid creating unreasonable demands or burdens for such servicesas snow plowing, mail delivery, garbage pickup, school bus, or emergencyservices.5. The fees for caretaker residences will be 25 percent more than thosecharged for recreation residence use of a similar site in the tract.6. A tract association may own caretaker residences.7. If a site ceases to be used as a caretaker residence, issue a new termpermit for recreation residence use to the holder, if qualified, or tothe purchaser of the improvements.Title 2700_Special Uses Management<ITAG tagnum="81">2721.23_Recreation Residence</ITAG>This designation includes only those residences that occupy planned, approvedtracts or those groups established for recreation residence use (FSM 2347for basic policy on recreation residence use).<ITAG tagnum="81">2721.23a_Administration</ITAG>The following direction relates specifically to issuance and administrationof special use permits for recreation residence. For recreation residencepermits in Alaska, follow the additional requirements in section 1303(d)of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.1. Issue special use permits for recreation residence in the name of oneindividual or to a husband and wife. Upon reissuance, renewal, or amendment,revise authorizations that are not issued to an individual or to a husbandand wife, so that the responsible person is identified.2. Issue no more than one recreation residence special use permit to asingle family (husband, wife, and dependent children).3. Do not issue special use permits for recreation residence use to entitiessuch as commercial enterprises, nonprofit organizations, business associations,corporations, partnerships, or other similar enterprises, except that atract association may own a caretaker residence.4. To the extent possible, issue all recreation residence permits in atract, or in logical groups of tracts, with the same expiration date.5. To help defray costs and provide additional recreation opportunities,a holder may obtain permission for incidental rental for specific periods.Ensure that rental use is solely for recreation purposes and does not changethe character of the area or use to a commercial nature. Rental arrangementsmust be in writing and approved in advance by the authorized officer. Theholder must remain responsible for compliance with the special use authorization.6. Allow no more than one dwelling per site to be built. In those caseswhere more than one dwelling (residence/sleeping cabin) currently occupiesa single site, allow the use to continue in accordance with the authorization.However, correct such deficiencies, if built without prior approval, upontransfer of ownership outside of the family (husband, wife and dependentchildren).7. When a recreation residence is included in the settlement of an estate,issue a new special use permit, undated to reflect policy and proceduralchanges, to the properly determined heir, if eligible. Prior to estatesettlement, issue an annual renewable permit to the executor or administratorto identify responsibility for the use pending final settlement of theestate. When a recreation residence is sold, issue a new term permit tothe buyer, if eligible.8. Specify in the permit that the recreation residence must be ooccupiedat least 15 days annually, the minimum acceptable period of occupancy.9. Issue recreation residence term permits for a maximum of 20 years.a. Term permits shall provide for renewal of 20-year permits 10 years beforeexpiration unless nonrenewal has been established.b. At the end of the first 10 years after initial issuance, offer holders,in writing, new 20-year term permits that also include the provision forrenewal at the end of 10 years, unless written notice of nonrenewal hasbeen given.c.

Clearly specify any limited tenure in the new permits with: ``This permitwill terminate on (<T3>insert date</T3>) and will not be renewed.''11. Recreation residences are a valid use of National Forest System landsand an important component of the total National Forest recreation program.Recreation residences may represent a substantial investment and have thepotential of supporting a large number of recreation person-days per acrecompared with other uses. Therefore, when considering nonrenewal of recreationresidence permits for an alternative use, be sure the clear weight of theevidence is on the side of the need for the higher public purpose of useat the location.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 11A.</T3> Remove this paragraph.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 11B.</T3> Recreation residences are a valid use of NationalForest land and a component of the total recreation program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 11C.</T3> Recreation residences are a component of the totalNational Forest recreation program.

In the event a recreation residence is destroyed or substantially damagedby a catastrophic event such as a flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement,conduct an environmental analysis to determine whether improvements onthe site can be safely occupied in the future under Federal and State lawsbefore issuing a permit to rebuild. Normally, the analysis should be completedwithin 6 months of such an event. Allow rebuilding if the site can be occupied safely. However, if the needfor a higher public use (alternative public use) at the same location hasbeen documented and established, do not allow rebuilding if the improvementsare more than 50 percent destroyed.

At the time special use permits are issued, advise holders that theymust notify the Forest Service if they intend to sell their improvements,and that they must provide a copy of the special use permit to a prospectivepurchaser before finalizing a sale. Whenever possible, advise a prospectivepurchaser of the terms and conditions of the special use permit beforethe sale is final. 17. Usually, do not stay a fee increase pending completion of an appealof the fee under the administrative review regulations. Make any adjustmentsresulting from the administrative review through credit, refund, or supplementalbilling. 18. During the terms of the permit, termination of the use may only takeplace in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit.Before approval by the Forest Supervisor, the Regional Forester will reviewproposed terminations (except termination for breach of terms of the permit),with supporting documentation and a summary of the public comments, andmay modify them. <ITAG tagnum="81">2721.23b_Applications </ITAG>Insofar as practicable, notify a new or prospective owner that he or shemust make application for the authorization to use existing improvementsin accordance with 36 CFR 251.54. <ITAG tagnum="81">2721.23c_Permit Preparation </ITAG>1.

As the initial base, use the fees established in one of the years between1978 and 1982. The first year of the fee cycle will be the first year ofthe established fee (disregarding any phase-in that may have been provided).Adjust the full base fee forward by applying the appropriate cumulativeImplicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD-GNP) adjustment factorshown in Exhibit 1. New fees for 1989, established in this manner, willbe phased-in over a 4-year period (1989-1992) at the rate of one-fourthof the increase each year, except that fees will not be phased-in for thosepermits that limit fee adjustments to 5-year intervals.In those cases where there may not be a fee established for the 1978-1982period, Regional Foresters are authorized, subject to concurrence of theChief, to utilize a different starting date and to adjust the length ofthe fee cycle so that all permits will have a new base fee determined duringthe 1998-2002 period.2. For 1990 through the last year of the fee cycle, adjust the fees onan annual basis by calculating the percentage change of the IPD-GNP index(as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce,in July of each year) from the second quarter of the previous year to thesecond quarter of the current year and applying this percentage adjustmentfactor to the current year's fees.For term permits that restrict adjustments to 5-year intervals, apply theIPD index adjustments cumulatively at 5-year intervals. At the end of thecurrent 20-year term, or earlier if agreed to by the holder, revise permitsto provide for annual indexing.3. Limit the annual fee adjustment for 1990 and thereafter to 10 percentper year when the change in the IPD-GNP index exceeds 10 percent in anyone year. The index amount in excess of 10 percent will be carried overand applied to the fee for the next succeeding year in which the indexfactor is less than 10 percent. The 10 percent limit shall not apply tothe fee adjustment (phased-in amount) for 1989.4. Re-appraise the site toward the end of the 20-year cycle. Beginningin the twenty-first year (the first year of the next fee cycle; 1998 inthe case of 1978 fees), put into effect the base fee for the next 20-yearcycle by applying 5 percent to the newly determined appraised market valueof the site for recreation residence purposes.5. In those few cases where one or more additional sleeping structures(guest cabins, and so forth) have been added to a single site, add to thecurrent adjusted base fee an additional charge equal to 25 percent of thefee established for a single residence use of the site or $100, whicheveris greater, per structure.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>13,L2,i1,s10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Exhibit</T4> 1._Sec. 33.1 <T4>IPD-GNP Adjustment Factor by Year</T4><H1>Base fee year</H1><H1>1979</H1><H1>1980</H1><H1>1981</H1><H1>1982</H1><H1>1983</H1><H1>1984</H1><H1>1985</H1><H1>1986</H1><H1>1987</H1><H1>1988</H1><H1>1989</H1><H1>Cum. adj.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1978<D>1.101</D><D>1.092</D><D>1.095</D><D>1.067</D><D>1.050</D><D>1.03</D><D>1.038</D><D>1.033</D><D>1.026</D><D>1.028</D><D>1.029</D><D>1.771</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979<D> </D><D>1.092</D><D>1.095</D><D>1.067</D><D>1.050</D><D>1.032</D><D>1.038</D><D>1.033</D><D>1.026</D><D>1.028</D><D>1.029</D><D>1.609</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980<D> </D><D> </D><D>1.095</D><D>1.067</D><D>1.050</D><D>1.032</D><D>1.038</D><D>1.033</D><D>1.026</D><D>1.028</D><D>1.029</D><D>1.473</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>1.067</D><D>1.050</D><D>1.032</D><D>1.038</D><D>1.033</D><D>1.026</D><D>1.028</D><D>1.029</D><D>1.346</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>1.050</D><D>1.032</D><D>1.038</D><D>1.033</D><D>1.026</D><D>1.028</D><D>.1029</D><D>1.261</D><F>(Note: Cum.

These factors represent an annualrate, based on the percent change from the first quarter to the secondquarter of the indicated year. The 1987 factor of 1.026 is the percentagechange in the IPD-GNP index from the second quarter of 1985 to the secondquarter of 1986 as reported in the July 1986 issue of ``United States Departmentof Commerce News,'' a publication by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. TheIPD-GNP index for the second quarter of 1985 is 111.1. The 1988 and 1989factors, were determined following the same procedures, using the appropriateyear's publication. The factors for 1979-1989 in Exhibit 1 are shown onlyto illustrate how the cumulative adjustment factor used to establish the1989 fee is determined. The factor was determined by chain multiplyingthe factor for the years within the base fee year period (for 1982 thiswould be 1.050 andmultiply; 1.032 andmultiply; 1.038 andmultiply; 1.033 andmultiply;1.026 andmultiply; 1.028 andmultiply; 1.029=1.261.)The following two examples illustrate use of this table in determiningthe 1989 fee:(1) A fee of $412 that became established in 1982 (first year in the feecycle) would be adjusted to $520 in 1989 ($412 andmultiply; 1.261). Thiswould be the fee amount owed by a holder who does not accept the new termpermit and would remain constant until the end of the five year adjustmentperiod. If a new term permit is accepted, the fee would be phased-in, andthe holder would be charged $439 for 1989, instead of the full amount.(2) A 1980 base year fee of $315 would be adjusted to $464 ($315 andmultiply;1.473) with the actual 1989 charge limited to $352 for a new term permit.A holder who keeps the old permit would pay the full fee of $464 in 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Factors for the years 1990 and thereafter will be determined in thesame manner as the 1989 factor. Using the 1989 factor as an example, theindex for the second quarter of 1987 as reported in the July 1987 Bureaupublication is 117.2; the index for February 1988 in the July 1988 Bureaupublication is 120.6. The percentage change in the index to be used todetermine 1989 fees is 120.6 minus 117.2 divided by 117.2. Thus, 1989 feeswill be 2.9 percent higher than 1988 fees for those permits that are indexed.Using the above two examples, calculation of the 1990 fees for those acceptingnew term permits would be as follows: (A 1990 IPD-GNP adjustment factorof 1.028 is assumed.)(1) The full 1989 fee of $520 times the IPD-GNP index factor for 1990 of1.028 equals $535, the full fee for 1990. The increase in the fee is $15.The amount of the 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $54 ($520^ $412 = $108/2 = $54). Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1982fee of $412 + $54 + $15 = $484.(2) The full 1990 fee equals $477, a fee increase of $13. The amount ofthe 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $75 ($464 ^ $315 = $149/2= $75). Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1980 fee of $315 +$75 + $13 = $403.33.11_<T3>Fee Credits.</T3> Provide holders any unused or remaining credits duethem under provisions of the Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 1983through 1986.33.2_<T3>Fees on Nonrenewal.</T3> When permits are placed on tenure (that is,the special use permit will not be renewed upon expiration), the annualfee for the tenth year prior to the expiration, referred to as the ``baseon-tenure fee,'' will be taken as a base and the fee for each year duringthe last ten years will be one-tenth of the base multiplied by the numberof years then remaining on the permit.

Use appraisals made by professonal appraisers for determining the marketvalue of the fee simple estate of the National Forest land underlying thesite subject to a special use permit, but without consideration as to howthe authorization would or could affect the fee title of the site (FSH5409.12, Chapter 6 for the standard contract to be used to establish fairmarket value of recreation residence sites).2. In consultation with affected holders, select and appraise typical sites(rather than all individual sites) within groups that have essentiallythe same or similar value characteristics. Within such groupings, adjustfor measurable differences between the sites. (Once properly established,typical site classifications should rarely change.)3. Ensure appraised values are based on comparable market sales of sufficientquality and quantity that will result in the least amount of dollar adjustmentto make them reflective of the subject sites' characteristics. Such charactertisticsinclude:a. Physical differences between subject site and the comparable sales.b. Legal constraints imposed upon the market by governmental agencies.c. Economic considerations evident in the local market.d. Locational considerations of subject site in relation to the market(sales) comparable.e. Functional usability and utility of the site.f. Amenities occurring to the site as compared with selected sales comparables.g. Availability of improvements (such as roads, water systems, and powerlines) provided by nonholder entities, including the United States. Donot adjust for improvements furnished by holders.h. Other market forces and factors identified as having a quantifiableeffect upon value.33.31_<T3>Appraisers. </T3>1.

A full, complete, and accurate definition of the appraisal problem.d. The standards of professional competence, ethics, and practice to whichthe appraiser shall adhere.e. Those requirements of the appraisal assignment that may be imposed under(1) statutes, (2) Federal regulations, (3) Forest Service policies andprocedures, and (4) situations unique to the given appraisal assignment.3. Require appraisers to notify affected holders by mail and offer to meetwith them to discuss the assignment, answer questions specific to the assignment,and seek advice, information, and cooperation from the holders and theirlocal organizations. The appraiser must notify holders of such a meetingat least 30 days in advance of the meeting. Send notices to the addressused for bills for collection. Use the notice to give the holders advanceinformation on the appraisal assignment. At such meetings, require thatthe appraiser have available copies of the appraisal instructions, directions,and requirements for review by the holders. An appraisal cannot be madeprior to the meeting with the holders.33.32_<T3>Establishing Recreation Residence Site Value.</T3> 1. Upon receiptof the appraisal report, conduct a review of the appraisal in conformancewith the standards of the National Association of Review Appraisers.2.

In the notification, informholders that they and other interested parties have 45 days in which toreview the appraisal. Upon request, provide copies of the report(s) andsupporting documentation pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.3. Upon request, provide an opportunity for affected holders to obtain,at their expense, an appraisal report from an appraiser holding at leastthe same or similar qualifications as the one selected by the Forest Service.a.

Discuss whether health and safety standardscan be met. e. <T3>Administrative Problems.</T3> Explain if the occupancy creates untenableadministrative problems or costs when related to the benefits providedthe holders and the general public, including fees, cultural benefits,barriers to environmentally harmful use, and other amenities or servicesattributable to the presence of the holders and their improvements. f. <T3>In-Lieu Site Availability.</T3> Make every reasonable effort to locateand reserve in-lieu sites that could be offered the holder for buildingor relocation of improvements. Such sites must be nonconflicting locationswithin or adjacent to the National Forest containing the residences (FSM2347.1 and FSM 2721.23e). Appropriate alternatives for consideration areundeveloped or withdrawn sites in, near, or adjacent to established tracts,or new tracts at locations not needed in the foreseeable future for a higherpublic use. Sites that are vacant because of breach or other factors shallbe available as in-lieu sites. Follow these procedures:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item f, first paragraph:</T3> Consider in-lieu sites thatcould be offered the holder for building or relocation of improvements.Such sites must be in nonconflicting locations within the National Forestcontaining the residences (FSM 2347.1 and FSM 2721.23e). Appropriate alternativesfor consideration are undeveloped sites within or adjacent to establishedtracts at locations not needed in the forseeable future for other publicuses. Sites that are vacant because of breach or other factors may be consideredas in-lieu sites. Follow these procedures:</ITAG>(1) If possible, offer in-lieu sites to holders at the time the nonrenewalnotice is given. If sites do not become available until later, offer themthen.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item (1):</T3> When available, offer in-lieu sites to holdersat the time the nonrenewal notice is given. If sites do not become availableuntil later, offer them then.</ITAG>(2) Give first priority to identifying and offering in-lieu sites in thesame tract or an expansion of that tract, where feasible. (3) Allow the holders 90 days from the date of the joint inspection ofthe lieu site or 90 days from the final disposition of any appeals of thenonrenewal decision, whichever is later, to accept or reject the offer.(4) When holders accept such offers, reserve the offered sites. Do notcharge a fee until the holder begins immproving the site. The site reservationwill expire upon holders failure to occupy the new site on a mutually-agreedupon schedule. (5) Allow holders accepting offers to continue use of their current sitesuntil the expiration date. Inform the holders that they should be preparedto move to the in-lieu site during the 24 months prior to the scheduledoccupany removal, provided a supplemental review of the nonrenewal actionhas been completed. (6) The opportunity to develop an in-lieu site, if accepted by the previousowner, will be extended to the new owner when there is a change in ownershipof authorized improvements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item (6).</T3> Remove this item. </ITAG>(7) Do not offer alternative sites for termination actions stemming fromnoncompliance with special use permit terms. 2. Factors To Consider In Nonrenewal Actions. Suppot nonrenewal decisionsby full consideration and documentation of the following specific factorsand criteria:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item 2, first paragraph.</T3> Nonrenewal decisions will bebased on the results of the continuing recreation residence use/nonrenewalanalysis. Decisions will be written documents supported by considerationof the following specific factors:</ITAG>a. The specific intended use or uses and the estimated time and budgetaryfeasibility of the need.b. The need for the alternative use and the reason for its priority.c. The reasons the public need cannot be met at an alternative location.d. All reasonable alternatives to the conversion, including the possibilityof combining or sharing public uses with recreation residence uses; andadjusting or altering lots or location of improvements to better accommodatecommon or shared uses.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item d.</T3> Remove ``All''.</ITAG>e. The reasons any conflict between the recreation residences and the proposedalternative use cannot be resolved.f. The need to develop and provide the public use needed in a cost effectivemanner.3. <T3>Higher Public Purpose.</T3> Identify and consider whether or not thereis clear need for higher priority use of the site that is of benefit tothe general public, is timely, in public demand, and where other sitesto satisfy the need cannot reasonably be made available. Need and timeliness,for example, can be demonstrated by capacity use of similar nearby facilities.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 3A, first paragraph. Other Public Purpose. </T3>Identify andconsider whether or not there is a need for the site that is a benefitto the general public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option 3B, first paragraph. Alternative Public Purpose.</T3> Identifyand consider whether or not there is a need for an alternative use of thesite that is of benefit to the general public, is timely, and in publicdemand. Need and timeliness can be demonstrated by capacity use of similarnearby facilities.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Examples of higher public purposes (alternatives public purposes)include but are not limited to (1) public roads and other public rights-of-waywhere no reasonable alternatives exist, (2) legally mandated public safetyor health requirements, (3) other public recreation needs, (4) habitatrequirements for rare or endangered species, and (5) commercial use developmentsserving National Forest programs, such as authorized resort accommodations,where no reasonable public or private alternatives exist. Determinationof higher public purpose (alternative public purpose) for commercial usemust show a clear and convincing need and bear a greater burden of proofthan those for other uses. Higher public purposes (alternative public purposes)do not include unspecified public needs or uses, such as general Forestuse or open space alone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item 3, second paragraph.</T3> Examples of alternatives publicpurposes include but are not limited to (1) public roads and other rights-of-way,(2) legally mandated public safety or health requirements, (3) other publicrecreation needs, (4) Habitat requirements for rare or endangered species,(5) natural and scenic values, and (6) commercial use developments servingNational Forest programs, such as authorized resort accommodations.</ITAG><T3>41.23c</T3>_<T3>Nonrenewal Notification.</T3> Provide holders 10 years or more advancenotice of nonrenewal actions except in cases involving breach, or whenthe site has been rendered legally unsafe by catastrophic events such asavalanche, flooding, or massive earth movement, or where the Forest Servicedoes not have final decision authority. In these exceptions, make an effortto provide as much notice as possible.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to first paragraph.</T3> Revise the first sentence as follows:``Provide as much advance notice as possible, with a goal of at least 10years, of nonrenewal actions except in cases involving breach or when thesite has been rendered legally unsafe by catastrophic events such as fire,avalanche, flooding, or massive earth movements or where the Forest Servicedoes not have final decision authority.''</ITAG>Include in a nonrenewal notice:1. A description of the action and the reasons for the decision. Normally,use the same expiration date for all affected holders in a particular groupor tract.2. Identification of the environmental assessment report or the environmentalimpact statement upon which the decision is based.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Option to item 2.</T3> Revise to read ``Identify the NEPA or otherdocument upon which the decision is based.</ITAG>3. Notice of appeal rights under 36 CFR 211.18.4. Notice that the holder should refrain from making costly repairs, improvements,or expenditures.
