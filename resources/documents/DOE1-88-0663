However, its potential for control of emissions from combustionprocesses and for the contributions it can make to environmental qualitycontrol have not yet been fully explored. The development and expandedapplications of select gas will be a major step toward utilizing thefull potential of natural gas for environmental quality control. Beyondselect use, natural gas is a fuel that is uniquely suited to meet therequirements of ever-changing environmental regulations and the widelyvarying operating conditions of existing power plant systems. While technologiesfor gas enhancement of coal and oil combustion are available, significanttechnical issues remain to be examined to have practical solutions onan industrial scale. The International Gas Union encourages the developmentof select use - and other uses of natural gas - and welcomes the opportunityto share knowledge for the advantage and benefit of all nations. 1 reference.</TEXT></DOC>
