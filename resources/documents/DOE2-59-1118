The modernization project based on demonstration tests withactual ships was launched in 1979 with an intention for improved competitivenessin international markets and securing the working places of marine workers.The crew organization was first decided in this project and requirementsfor equipment and facilities were established later according to thecrew organization. with particular emphasis placed on the rationalizationand automation of maneuver and cargo handling at ports. An experimentwith the pioneer ship was started with a target crew of 11 persons. Characteristicevents for the engine section included reduced fuel consumption and highefficiency waste heat recovery. The control of engine was highly concentratedin the trial in 1970's and rather distributed recently. For navigationcontrol, hybrid systems of navigation instruments have been employedfor the position determination and the collision prevention support.(4 figs, 1 tab, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
