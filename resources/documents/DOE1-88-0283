The Nuclear Test Engineering Divisionin support of the Nuclear Test Program has been given the responsibilityfor making these predictions. Ground motions resulting from the firingof one event can have a serious impact on the safety, location and schedulingof other events at the Nevada Test Site. Currently, the methods usedto predict ground motion and thereby, structural response, are empiricallybased. It is therefore critical, that actual ground motions and structuralresponses be monitored for comparison with the predictions. This reportdocuments the findings resulting from the LOCKNEY event interacting withthe KERNVILLE event. This interaction was unique in that it was the firsttime a canister had been left suspended from the Ringer Crane duringa predicted Class 3 interaction. Ground motions are examined in the timedomain for comparison with predictions. Ground motions are also examinedin the frequency domain. The spectral content of the interaction signalis important when attempting to make structural response predictions.No spectral information is incorporated in our present response predictions.In addition to ground motion evaluation, the structural responses ofsome key components at the KERNVILLE ground zero are evaluated. Finally,summaries and conclusions are presented. 15 refs., 23 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
