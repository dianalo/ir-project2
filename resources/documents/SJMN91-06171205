Parrish Inc., San Jose;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: Because of Rotwein's &quot;adventurous and curious&quot; nature, shehas tried para-sailing, mountain climbing, surfing and scuba diving. She gaveup parachuting right away after landing in a field of brussels sprouts.;   Except for the time she spent in Aspen, Colo., after high school -- she wentthere for the summer and ended up staying for nine months &quot;partying, living onpennies and eating oatmeal three times a day,&quot; she has been fit and physicallyactive all her life.;    After getting burned out in Aspen and feeling a needto get grounded, she moved to Santa Cruz to attend school. For the past 15years, her pursuit of a mix of enjoyable activities has kept her consistentlycommitted to feeling good through exercise.;    REGIMEN: &quot;I'm one of the'morning maniacs' who gets up at 4:30 a.m. Monday through Friday to be at thegym no later than 5:15.&quot; Her stationary bike rides end when she's finishedreading the newspaper. After a stair simulator and treadmill workout, she doesa light free-weights routine and stretching exercises on a mat. When she's intown on Saturdays, she's in the gym again, but not until 8 a.m.;    Threetimes a week, she either swims a mile or runs an average of five miles in thehills. Mountain bike rides on the weekends last from two to three hours. Shestill scuba dives and tennis is next on her athletic agenda.;    RESULTS: &quot;Ilike the overall package that comes from being fit. You look and feel good. .. . I never have to push myself because I enjoy it so much -- people who workout regularly understand that.&quot;;    GOALS: &quot;I might like to take up acompetitive sport,&quot; she says, &quot;like tennis.&quot; She's been encouraged to considertriathlons because &quot;I can do everything I need to do,&quot; but she says she's notsure she wants to give up parts of her current routine in order to dospecialized training.;    OBSTACLES: It's difficult getting up that early inthe morning, she admits, which is why the volume on her alarm clock is setvery high. &quot;I've tried it both ways, but I always feel more refreshed aftergoing to the gym than by getting a few extra hours of sleep.&quot;;    TIPS ANDCOMMENTS: &quot;I don't feel like anything I do is exceptional. I also work hard atmy job, spend time with friends and take a class in the evening. I feel verybalanced because what I do makes me happy. And as a result, I stay in goodshape.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  -- Sue Chenoweth  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910619  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  459  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 19, 199100171205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
