Isuggest it is wrong for Mr. Murray to apply 20th-centurystandards to a young, single Victorian woman. Before she wasable to define her political and economic views, Miss Potterhad first to overcome the prejudice against women doing anykind of significant work, as well as a lack of formaleducation -- all by doing research in the streets of Londonto experience first-hand the poverty and despair that existedside by side with the riches of her own mercantile class.</LP><TEXT>   When her socialism finally flowered in the next decade ofher life, it was the inevitable conclusion to her study, herfield work and her marriage to Sidney Webb. But it was earlyon as a rent collector in charity housing that she firstlearned the grim lesson that private schemes do not work;that only government has the means to eradicate poverty insociety.   Mr. Murray, however, is right to note that the poverty ofVictorian times exists in our own time and in our own land.Perhaps it is time to revive the Webbs and the Fabians, andput socialism to its real test: in America -- where it shouldhave been implemented in the first place.
