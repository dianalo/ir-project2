(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Light AlternativeandM;Magnetic disks, while the primary storage media of choice, are not withouttheir drawbacks, especially in a networking environment.andP;  They areenvironment-sensitive, limited in capacity, and vulnerable to damaging headcrashes.andP;  Furthermore, they are bulky -- not a small factor when consideringthe vast amounts of primary storage media required in large networks.andP;  AsLANs grow, the sheer volume of the magnetic disks required to satisfy storagedemands can swell a file server from a desktop machine to the size of a smallrefrigerator.andM;Enter optical disks, which, like digital audio tape (DAT), are better knownfor their musical than their data storage applications.andP;  At first glance,optical disks are a miracle.andP;  They are impervious to heat and dust, portable,and virtually immune to head crashes.andP;  One ANSI-standard optical diskprovides 650MB of storage in a fraction of the space a magnetic disk wouldtake up for the same capacity.andM;The characteristics of optical disks also make them a viable alternative totape backup.andP;  Like magnetic drives, optical disk drives use random, notsequential, access, which makes retrieving achived data much faster.andO;Restoring files from tape requires a sequential search for the file.andO;Archiving to tape requires that files be written continuously, not fragmentedto fit wherever there is space.andP;  And like floppy disks, optical disks arecompact, making data easily portable.andM;Optical disks were first used in the LAN world in CD-ROM and write-onceread-many (WORM) formats.andP;  While both have their continued uses, it wasn'tuntil the advent of rewritable -- also known as erasable -- opticaltechnology that they became a serious storage alternative.andM;Drawn to the LightandM;Rewritable technology is still in its early stages, which, for the end user,means it is slow and expensive.andP;  Although one optical disk provides 325MB ofstorage online, accessing that information can take almost a tenth of asecond, as opposed to the 10 millisecond access times of the fastest magneticdisks.andP;  Accessing the other 325MB means physically removing the cartridge andflipping it over, which takes far more time.andP;  (The disks are two-sided, butthe drives are not.)andM;Current rewritable technology requires that optical drives erase data beforethey can write over it, for data integrity reasons.andP;  Whereas a magnetic diskwrites data once, then optionally verifies it, an optical disk has to make anerase pass to eradicate any previous data recorded on the area it's about towrite to.andP;  Then the disk head makes a write pass, and finally it makes anoptional verify pass.andP;  The laserdiode heads are also bulkier and harder tomove across the platter than the magnetic heads on a magnetic disk.andM;The issue of speed is deceptive, however, given the types of applicationsoptical disks are best suited for.andP;  For now, optical disks are primarily usedfor storing enormous amounts of data in applications such as imaging ofmagazine pre-press.andP;  One four-color page in a magzine, for example, cantranslate ito a 1MB file.andP;  With file sizes this large, the speed at whichthey can be accessed is secondary to the capacity and ata integrity providedby an optical disk.andM;At 350MB, manetic disks are, on the average, about $1,000 to $1,500 lessexpensive than optical disks.andP;  That, however, is a comparison between a 350MBmagnetic disk and a 650MB optical disk.andP;  A 650MB magnetic disk can run closeto $8,000, whereas, depending on the manufacturer, an optical disk can costas little as $7,000.andP;  As the capacities increase, the price per megabyte ofan optical disk becomes competitive with that of a magnetic disk.andM;As is also typical of an emerging technology, optical disks have not yetreached the level of compatibility with one another that magnetic disks haveachieved.andP;  This means that an optical drive from one vendor may not be ableto read a disk written by another drive.andP;  (Incidentally, early optical drivesdidn't quite fit the form factor of a magnetic disk, making them difficult tofit into a PC box, although vendors have now managed to downside them.)andP;  Thecompatibility compalint is a distant second to the problem of speed, however,possibly because optical drives aren't yet the commodity that magnetic drivesare.andP;  Users tend to stay with products from the same manufacturer.andM;The main advantage optical disks have over magnetic disks is the vast amountof data they can store in a limited space.andP;  By using lasers, instead ofmagnetic read-write heads, optical drives can write data onto physicallysmaller areas on the recording media than magnetic drives can.andP;  A laser canpinpoint a precise area of the disk and heat it to the point that itspolarity can be changed, thus recording the bit of information.andP;  A magneticdisk relies on the magnetic head to directly change the polarity of amagnetic particle and thereby store the bit.andM;To influence a smaller area, the magnetic disk's head has to be positionedcloser to the surface, and eventually there is no more room between the headand the platter.andP;  Optical drives are able to leave more space between theread-write head and disk surface than magnetic drives, thereby reducing thethreat of head crashes.andP;  Furthermore, the recording media on an optical diskis sandwiched between layers of protective substrate whereas the magneticmedia of a magnetic disk is coated or plated onto the surface.andP;  If the headof an optical drive were to crash down on the surface, it wouldn't gouge therecording media as it would on a magnetic drive.andM;A single optical disk has a total capacity of 650MB, with 325MB in a singlecartridge accessible at any time.andP;  The size, maneuverability, and resilienceof optical disks also gives them the option of being stacked in a jukebox,something that's impossible with hefty fixed magnetic drives or flimsyfloppies.andP;  An optical disk jukebox, with roots in the musical variety,incorporates one or more optical drives, as well as the disks themselves, andcan provide the user with theoretically infinite storage.andP;  Most jukeboxesprovide between 30GB and 50GB, all of which is online.andP;  The access speeds canbe as long as three or four seconds, but again, with the kinds ofapplications that demand such enormous online storage, speed is a secondaryconsideration.andP;  In any case, it is always faster to wait a few seconds forthe jukebox to load the proper optical disk than to wait for the systemoperator to retrieve the file you need from the rack of tape cartridges.andM;Novell NetWare users don't even need a jukebox to access information onseveral optical disks.andP;  With NetWare's Mount/Remove command, users canaccumulate a library of optical disks that they can shuffle in a singleoptical drive.andP;  Each disk can be mounted as an additional volume underNetWare and then removed when the user is finished.andM;Optical disks could also be viewed as an alternative to floppy disks,although at capacities of 650MB versus 1.5MB or even 640KB, there doesn'tseem to be much comparison.andP;  For the most part, the two markets will probablynot overlap since users who have previously found floppies adequate clearlywill not want to pay for optical capacities.andM;A New Backup MediumandM;The arena in which optical disks have become a serious threat is in thebackup and archiving industry.andP;  The initial resistance is cost, but withprices expected to come down within the next year or two, tape may begin tolose its foothold.andP;  Optical drives compete with tape drives in performanceand surpass them in data recovery.andP;  &quot;Optical drives can transfer data as fastas any tape drive,&quot; says Ron Johnston, chairman emeritus and vice presidentof marketing at Racet Computes, a magnetic and optical disk manufacturer.andO;&quot;They're very powerful devices.&quot;andM;Optical disks offer several advantages over traditional streaming tapedrivers.andP;  First, since optical disks can be viewed as just another logicaldrive or directory, users can see exactly what files are stored on any givenoptical disk at any given time.andP;  Keeping track of the information stored ontape drives is not as intuitive.andP;  &quot;That's a big pyschological advantage,&quot;says Johnston.andP;  Given the proper application software, a directory of thecontents of a tape can be kept on a magnetic disk, but the proper tapecartridge still has to be loaded into the tape backup unit.andM;Also, since optical disks are random access devices with access speedsmeasured in milliseconds instead of minutes, data recovery is far quickerthan with tape.andP;  With sequential access tape, data recovery can take half anhour or more.andP;  Random access also allows updated versions of files to besaved over earlier versions, both conserving space and eliminating confusion.andM;Crawford Del Pret, a market analyst specializing in storage at IDC, discountsthe performance issues of optical disks over tape where archiving isconcerned.andP;  &quot;Optical disks would like to be the backup media of choice, butthey're still really expensive,&quot; says Del Pret.andP;  &quot;Random access and speedreally aren't issues when they can cost two and a half times as much.&quot;andM;When comparing the optical media to the tape media, optical is significantlymore expensive.andP;  An 650MB optical disk costs about $300, as opposed to $50for a 525MB streaming tape cartridge.andP;  Optical disk prices should drop withinthe next two years, making it, if not competitive with tape, at least athreat given its performance advantages.andP;  The advent of the 3-1/2-inchrewritable optical technology, which will be priced at about $100 for a 128MBdisk, will give end users yet another option for backup.andM;Just BrowsingandM;Optical storage was available in static forms long before the advent ofrewritable technology.andP;  WORM and CD-ROM drives were being used for archivingand database distribution respectively.andP;  Neither is obsolete yet.andM;Worn drives are still a force, albeit a weakening one, in the backup world.andO;They use lasers to scorch information permanently onto the disk.andP;  Oncewritten, the information can never be altered, which, if price isn't anissue, makes WORMs ideal for backup since they have all the random accessadvantages of rewritable technology.andM;WORM disks are also necessary in some very specific instances, such asfinancial applications, where users need to maintain an exact audit trail ofall transactions.andP;  Racet's Johnston sees a significant role for WORM drivesin the next one to three years, based on the fact that the governmentspecifies them in many of its contract bids.andP;  Beyond that market, Johnstonsays that everything that can be done with WORM drives can be betteraccomplished with rewritable optical disks, with software file lockingproviding the same audit trail capability.andM;CD-ROMs have long been used to distribute large databases of information,such as telephone directories, online manuals, and encyclopedias, to multiplesites for repeated viewing.andP;  For example, Opti-Net from Online ComputerSystems (Germantown, Md.) provides CD-ROMs of Grolier's New ElectronicEncyclopedia and Microsoft's Programmer Library, Bookshelf, StatPak and SmallBusiness Consultant, which NetWare users can share.andM;CD-ROMs will probably not be driven out of the marketplace by rewritableoptical storage.andP;  They will instead be complementary technologies.andP;  &quot;CD-ROMsare still the media of choice when you need to distribute large amounts ofinformation that would otherwise have to be sent on tape,&quot; says IDC's DelPret.andP;  &quot;They're important for networks because you can buy one database, putit on a CD-ROM server, and everyone can share it.&quot;andP;  That can't be done withtape.andP;  If there are fewer than 20 sites to distribute information to, it maybe more economical and faster to use rewritable storage since it eliminatesthe mastering and stamping required to load information onto CD-ROMs.andM;In the Real WorldandM;Optical disks have not yet taken over a huge share of either the primarystorage or backup marketplaces.andP;  That is not to say they are not inwidespread use.andP;  Companies with storage-intensive applications, especiallythose who make extensive use of graphics and imaging have embraced opticalstorage as their miracle media.andM;One application in which optical disks can ease a paper-intensive process isa financial institution, where applications are scanned into the system andstored on optical disk.andP;  The application can then be viewed and processed byauthorized users without the hassle of having to pass around the physicalapplication.andP;  The same procedure can be used un credit card applications.andP;  GECapital, in Plainville, Conn., for example, uses the FileNet system byFileNet, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., to scan credit card slips and storethem on optical disks.andP;  When customer service representatives receiveinquiries about an account, they can call up the information immediately,without shuffling through thousands of tiny pieces of paper.andM;Pfizer Pharmaceuticals submitted an application for a new drug to the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA), using hardware and software from NewYork-based Advanced Graphics Applications (AGA).andP;  The 35,000-pageapplication, which in paper format would run into hundreds of volumes, wassubmitted on a mere three optical disks.andP;  The FDA reviewer can retrieve anypart of the application using AGA's Discus rewritable optical drive, ahigh-resolution monitor, and image viewing software.andM;Federated Insurance, based in Minn., uses a cooperative processing systemspecially designed for image management.andP;  This insurance company finds thatthe Metaview System from Metafile Information Systems (Rochester Minn)significantly reduces the amount of paper involved in its claims process andpolicy information printing.andP;  Users across the company's wide area networkcan access information from the central-office database, reducing the numberof copies of claims forms required.andM;Metaview is a cooperative processing language specially designed for imagemanagement.andP;  Metaview is actually a development language designed to createPC applications that can access text and data from mainframes and images froma dedicated image server.andM;Metaview designates a PC as an image server, and can support both 5-1/4- and12-inch WORM drives.andP;  (Although there are no technical obstacles to usingrewritable drives, Metafile does not yet support them.)andP;  The image server cansupport up to seven daisy-chained drives, or, if more capacity is required,up to 20 jukeboxes, each with 50 disks, can be put on the network.andM;While image management is currently the primary use for optical disks, withinthe next few years they could become a necessary part of any businessnetwork.andP;  As both PCs and networks become more sophisticated, incorporatingvoice and video as well as scanned images, optical disks will become anecessity because they can store more data in a much smaller space.andM;While a high-end, multimedia network is probably years away, imminentimprovements in optical storage may make them viable for many large networkswithin the next year.andP;  A crop of 3-1/2-inch optical drives is slated toarrive this spring, which adds another dimension to the storage choice.andM;Optical disks and magnetic disks are not necessarily mutually exclusive,either.andP;  Many users use a magnetic disk for their primary storage and anoptical disk for data they use frequently but not constantly.andP;  In a sense,optical drives have created a grey area between primary storage and backupthat they alone can fill.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
