Silver prices shot higher yesterday, with the Julycontract climbing 24.5 cents an ounce to $4.43.</LP><TEXT>   The move surprised many analysts and traders, who had seensilver's several attempts to rally in recent months faltereach time the price rose to between $4.20 and $4.25.   Yesterday's surge began overnight in Hong Kong and Zurichas buying by Middle East investors pushed up prices to levelsthat triggered executions of previously placed buy orders,said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at MerrillLynch.   An improved economic outlook, plus a report issued by theSilver Institute this week showing silver supplies fallingshort of demand, also contributed to the bullish sentiment,he added.   Most of the trading was short-covering, Mr. O'Neill said.Traders cover their short positions, or bets that the pricewill fall, by buying offsetting contracts. But, he adds, somefresh buying of silver entered the market as the day wore on.   Ian MacDonald, vice president of precious metals at CreditSuisse, said he has noticed a lot of commodity funds andpools coming into precious metals markets over the pastmonth. He said some commodity fund managers, having seen thestock market surge in recent months, think precious metalsmay begin rising soon.   The stock market had rallied in response to expectationsof an economic recovery, Mr. MacDonald said, and a bettereconomy should also mean stronger demand -- and higher prices-- for commodities. Demand for silver has already shown signsof improvement, particularly in the jewelry and flatwearindustries in Italy and Germany, he added.   There's been a myth of a massive oversupply of silver,asserts William Fleckenstein, a Seattle money manager whoinvests in silver for his personal account. &quot;There's been alot of exaggeration of facts,&quot; he said.   As indicated by the Silver Institute's report, the supplyand demand balance has been improving for some time, said Mr.Fleckenstein, who has been building a position in silver fora year and a half.   &quot;I've been in the position of being long and wrong for awhile,&quot; he says, but thinks his -- and silver's -- time iscoming. If investor interest in silver is rekindled, he says,&quot;It's not ridiculous to assume an $8 to $10 price&quot; within thenext 18 months. He adds he would be &quot;flabbergasted&quot; if silverfailed to climb to at least $6 an ounce. Silver has a historyof moving a lot when it does move, he noted.   Analysts are generally optimistic that silver willcontinue rallying in the near-term. Peter Cardillo, directorof commodity research at Jesup Josephthal andamp; Co., said silverwill test $4.65 to $4.66 within the next couple of tradingsessions and possibly will rise another five to 10 centstoday.   Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch agreed that silver'stechnical picture is &quot;vastly improved.&quot; But speculatorsshould watch out for producer selling, he added, which couldquickly abort the rally.   Also, Mr. MacDonald of Credit Suisse cautioned thatprofit-taking could be expected after a big rise likeyesterday's.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: July crude oil futures contracts lost another 14cents in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchangeyesterday, settling at $20.33 a barrel. The trading sessionseemed driven more by technical factors than by fundamentalnews events, market watchers said. July gasoline, afterhaving more than two cents lopped off its price inWednesday's trading, recovered slightly, gaining 0.32 cent agallon to finish at 64.44 cents. Separately, the Merc's boardsaid it would submit a sour crude oil futures contract toregulators for approval. The exchange said that more thantwo-thirds of the world's crude oil is sour, meaning it has ahigher sulfur content than the so-called sweet grade that iscurrently traded on the Merc.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: July corn and wheat futures pricesdeclined slightly on fund buying and selling in a thinmarket. During a day with little market-moving news, analystssaid some fund buying of corn was tied to Congressionaltestimony of agriculture officials from Iowa and Minnesota,who reported that wet weather has delayed planting of corncrops in those states. Price gains based on the testimonytapered off late in the day, as traders realized that thetestimony was based on relatively old news: last week'splanting reports. Reports are due out today on plantingprogress in the western corn belt. The price of the corncontract for July delivery fell 0.75 cent to $2.45 a bushel,while the July wheat contract fell 1.5 cents to $2.91 abushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell in response to progress madein Chile labor negotiations. July copper ended 1.5 cents apound lower at 99.7 cents. A labor settlement was reached atone mine, owned by Codelco, the world's largest copperproducer, said John E. Gross, a West Nyack, N.Y., metalsconsultant. Miners at another Codelco mine, Chuquicamata,agreed to return to the negotiating table. The market is at acrucial point where events will set the direction of thecopper market for the next several months, Mr. Gross said. Ifstrikes are averted at Codelco and if the economy continuesto be soft, copper prices could fall, he said. However,prices could rise if the Codelco talks hit a snag, or if theeconomy rebounds sufficiently to spur demand for copper,creating some short-term supply tightness, he said. Mr. Grosssaid a technical condition in the market also could lendsupport to prices over the next month. The number ofoutstanding July contracts represents potential deliveries of258,138 tons, far in excess of warehouse inventories of about25,000 tons, he points out. Traders who have commitments todeliver copper can easily negate them by buying offsettingcontracts, which could buoy the market, Mr. Gross said.</TEXT></DOC>
