ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A show of strength by the Group of Seven majorindustrial companies sent the dollar sliding Monday.   Gold prices moved higher.   Several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, solddollars against major foreign currencies to bring the dollar downsharply from its recent high levels.   The dollar regained some ground late in the day, but dealerssaid trading was nervous after a weekend meeting in which Group ofSeven finance ministers and central bank chiefs said they weredetermined to keep the U.S. currency from rising.   ``They're trying to show some muscle,'' Robert Ryan, seniorcurrency trader with Irving Trust Co., said of the seven nations.``The market is wondering who's going to win the battle.''   In a strongly worded communique, the United States, WestGermany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada said ``a rise inthe dollar above current levels, or an excessive decline, couldaffect prospects for the world economy.''   Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust andamp; Co. in Chicago,predicted ``the market is going to be nervous going long'' becausetraders are concerned about continued central bank intervention andpossible interest rate hikes in West Germany and Japan.   When interest rates rise overseas, the dollar tends to fall ifthe increases are not matched in this country. Johnson said somedollar traders expect U.S. economic growth to slow and the Fed torelax interest rates here.   The Bank of Japan led Monday's market intervention, and the Fedand the Bank of Canada also sold dollars in Japan, dealers said.   The Fed also intervened in later trading, as did the British,West German, French and Swiss central banks, they said.
