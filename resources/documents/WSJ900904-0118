At least, that's how it looks upon examination of the NewYork Stock Exchange shares that did best and worst lastmonth.</LP><TEXT>   Among the ten stocks that rallied the most, even as theBig Board's Composite Index -- the broadest measure of theexchange's common stocks -- fell 9.06%, are shares ofcompanies showing an earnings turnaround, strengthening theirbalance sheets, or that are in the energy business. Takeoverstocks were the two biggest gainers.   Among the biggest losers, a common characteristic wasdisappointing earnings -- in a market already looking aheadto weaker corporate profits.   Unlike the prestige group of high-growth issues thatdominated investors' attention for the first half of theyear, many of the winning stocks trade thinly and are sharesof companies reporting better earnings for the first time ina long while. Indeed, some of these stock prices are lowbecause of a history of bad earnings; small price advancesproduce big percentage gains.   Even so, the stories behind the stocks of August provideinvestors an early look at what concepts of value are likelyto move stocks higher in the weeks ahead.   &quot;This is an event-driven market,&quot; says Michael Painchaud,principal at Market Profile Theorems, a Seattle firm thatstudies stock market trends. The event is the threat to alarge portion of the world's oil supply; the most visiblerepercussion in the stock market has been a sharpappreciation in energy issues.   Global Marine, a highly leveraged, international offshoredriller and producer, could benefit from an escalation in rigfees. The company was in bankruptcy proceedings until March1989, and debt is currently about 400% of equity. But DavidHerasimchuk, head of investor relations, says the companynegotiated beneficial terms on the remaining debt, which willgive it the flexibility to grow with an oil boom. With U.S.energy policy likely to encourage domestic exploration andproduction, Global Marine, with 27 drilling rigs, is inposition to benefit.   Some investors sought haven last month in stocks ofcompanies that are snapping a streak of bad earnings. &quot;Themarket's reaction to the Mideast has been so severe becauseof the fear that it would make a weak profit situationworse,&quot; says Joseph McAlinden, director of research at DillonRead. &quot;Any company bucking that trend would be a buycandidate.&quot;   Aside from the energy stocks, companies reporting orexpecting better earnings among the top ten are Bolt Beranekandamp; Newman, Aileen, Talley Industries, Carriage Industries, andGRC International.   Bolt Beranek andamp; Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., technologycompany, earned 21 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarterended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.27 a share in thesame period a year earlier. Also, the company plans to buyback $15 million of its long-term debt, and about 700,000shares of stock, to strengthen its balance sheet. Analystsare wary of recommending the stock yet because of priorlosses. But Steven B. Frankel, vice president at Adams,Harkness andamp; Hill, says he is convinced the company has &quot;astorehouse of valuable technology.&quot;   Earnings at Talley Industries are expected to get a boosteventually from royalties on automobile air bags. The companysold its air bag business to TRW Inc. more than a year ago,but secured a 12-year royalty agreement that could be worth$190 million, the company says.   Carriage Industries, a carpet maker, earned 44 cents ashare in the fourth quarter ended July 1, compared with 1cent a share in the year-earlier period. The company,followed by few analysts on Wall Street, is expecting furtherearnings improvement in 1991, and gains in market share.   Marion Merrell Dow is expected to have stable to higherearnings in coming quarters. But a huge buyer in the market-- Dow Chemical -- is largely responsible for lifting thestock 19% last month. Michael Smith, director of research atB.C. Christopher, says investors perceive a floor under thestock because of Dow Chemical's option to purchase up to 80%of the shares outstanding by July 1992. Dow Chemicalannounced Friday that it owns a 68% stake.   GRC International earned 10 cents a share in the fourthquarter ended June 30 compared with a 20 cent loss theprevious year. The company is also redeeming some bonds withhigh interest rates.   Another example of investors favoring stronger balancesheets is Health Equity Properties. The real estateinvestment trust trimmed its short-term debt burden inAugust, replacing it with bonds convertible into stock.   Real buy-outs and stocks that appear to be takeovercandidates shot up in August.   Fund American Cos. recently agreed to sell its insuranceoperations to West German insurer Allianz for $3.3 billion.The remaining company has a large investment in oil stocks.   Equimark's share price was rising even before the Tischfamily on Friday disclosed a 6.8% stake in the company. Oneanalyst, who declined to be identified, said investors havebeen buying the stock on the possibility of a takeover.&quot;Investors are looking at the break-up value,&quot; he said. Theythink Equimark Chairman Alan Fellheimer &quot;will salvage hisinvestment&quot; by selling parts or all of the company, theanalyst said.   The earnings disappointments of the top losers echoedseveral familiar woes: slumping consumer spending, falloutfrom a lousy junk-bond market, debt problems, tighteningcredit and rising oil prices.   AmBase, a New York insurance and financial servicesconcern, was the top percentage loser. It had a largesecond-quarter loss, compared to a year-earlier profit. Thecompany cited losses from junk-bond holdings in its HomeInsurance Co. unit and lackluster results in its investmentservices operations, including Gruntal andamp; Co., a brokerage.Adding to its woes were doubts about a plan to sell theinsurance unit.   Businessland, the San Jose, Calif., computer retailer,posted a large loss for its fourth-quarter ended June 30. Theloss put the company in violation of covenants on seniornotes and surprised analysts, who were further distressed bynews that the company would have to restate results for thefiscal second and third quarters because of accountingerrors.   Huntway Partners, the third-largest loser, can place atleast some of the blame for its performance squarely onSaddam Hussein. The Valencia, Calif., liquid-asphalt companysaid that while first-half results were strong, rising oilprices would hurt earnings in the future -- especially sinceasphalt prices have been falling.   Finevest Foods, a Greenwich, Conn., frozen-food anddairy-products company, posted second-quarter earnings of$764,000, or seven cents a share, up from $179,000, or twocents a share, a year earlier. But some analysts wereexpecting 10 cents a share, the company says. With just 10.6million shares outstanding, and 51% of them in the chairman'shands, it isn't hard to move the stock.   For Fairfield Communities, the problem is skittishnessabout the real estate business. Its lender, Bank of Boston,cut the resort developer's credit facility and put thecompany on a 47-month installment plan to pay the debtoutstanding. The company said the move would hurt its abilityto do business.   Tacoma Boatbuilding, Tacoma, Wash., might have beenexpected to do better last month, with roughly half itsbusiness coming from U.S. and foreign government militarycontracts. But the company posted a second-quarter loss,compared with a year-earlier profit. Expansion costs arehurting profitability, the company said.   As an industrial sewing-machine maker, Reece Corp., basedin Waltham, Mass., posted a loss and cut its dividend, citinga slowdown in capital spending among struggling apparelmakers.   &quot;What's worse for us is the credit crunch,&quot; says Don Blom,vice president, finance. &quot;That has had a pronounced effect onour smaller customers that tend to finance their equipmentneeds.&quot;   Great American Bank, based in San Diego, posted a sharplywider loss due to loan and real-estate losses near the end ofJuly, knocking it out of compliance with regulatoryrequirements. There isn't any guarantee that a pending saleof some its branches would meet regulatory and shareholderapproval, the bank said.   Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Newton, Mass., was anothercompany where shares got hammered for reportinglower-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The long-termhealth-care provider announced a $10 million buy-back ofstock, but the stock didn't respond.   Investors sold shares of TCBY Enterprises, a Little Rock,Ark., chain of yogurt stores, on the news that third-quarterearnings would be hurt by increased competition and a slowingeconomy.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stocks closed higher in the slowest session of the year,with institutional and futures-related buying lifting prices.
