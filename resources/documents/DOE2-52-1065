The selected energyof the incident charged particles (1.4 MeV) allows an accurate determinationof the deep carbon. Carbon ranges in concentration from 30 ppm (closeto the detection limit) to 700 ppm. Our results exhibit: a heterogeneousdistribution of carbon in the submarine glasses, probably related withthe CO/sub 2/ vesicles nucleation process, a relation between the carboncontent of the melt inclusions and the pressure of crystallization ofthe host mineral. 7 figs, 39 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
