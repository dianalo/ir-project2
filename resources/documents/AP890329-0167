The statement said Mrs. Bush sought treatment after ``mildswelling and irritation of the eyes and some loss of weight.''   Mrs. Bush has been taking medication for four days, and has``noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' the statementsaid.   Sondra Haley, a press aide to Mrs. Bush, said the condition,which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was ``completelyunder control.''   ``It's not serious. It was more of an eye irritation,'' Ms.Haley said.   The statement said the disease is caused by the production ofexcess amounts of hormones from the thyroid gland.   It said the diagnosis was confirmed by blood tests last Fridayat Walter Reed Army Medical Center which showed ``slight elevationsof two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothryonine.''   Medical tests on the first lady included a thyroid scan and anelectrocardiograph, the statement said.   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physicians and anexpert in tyroid disorders at Walter Reed, the statement said.   She has been taking methimazole, a drug that blocks theproduction of thyroid hormones, the statement said.   Grave's disease is a disorder that causes the thyroid gland toover produce the thyroid hormone. The specific cause of the diseaseis not known, but it is thought to be related to a reaction of theimmune system. The symptoms can include an enlarged thyroid gland(goiter), fatigue, heart arrythmias, insomnia, skin conditions andfatigue. Some patients also develop swelling in tissues of the eye,resulting in irritation, pain and light sensitivity.   The disease can be controlled by a variety of drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
