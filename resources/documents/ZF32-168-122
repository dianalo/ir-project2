 bankingsystem, it's all too evident that these are tough times.andP;  But through aserendipitous convergence of trends and events, the computer graphics marketis in great shape to weather anything the economy throws at it.andP;  It's a goodplace to be.andP;  There are solid reasons:andM;* Market size.andP;  The major computer graphics submarkets are now big enough tosustain a downturn, yet are small enough to have some of the growthcharacteristics of niche markets.andP;  Many of them have leading players runningover $100 million in revenues in the line of business, and many of them havelarge, financially secure companies selling product in them.andM;* Applications.andP;  Many of the computer graphics disciplines, especially CADand medical imaging, support mission critical applications.andP;  For companiesthat depend on these applications, economic downturns ironically meanincreasing investment to gain competitive advantage.andP;  The advantage comesfrom quicker time to market or better customer service.andP;  The electronicdesign market, for instance, is in a miniboom as chip makers rush new designsto market.andM;* Price thresholds.andP;  Many of the submarkets are going through a renaissancebased on the fact that applications once reserved for expensive host systemsor specialty hardware and turnkey systems are now available on workstationsor PCs.andP;  Entry-level technical workstations are now under $10,000, whileentry-level graphics supercomputers are now under  70,000.andM;* Penetration.andP;  Computer graphics has gone from a novelty to a critical partof mainstream computing.andP;  Visualization may be off to a slow start, butdesktop publishing, medical imaging, and digital video more than make up forit.andP;  The increasing popularity of corporate TV networks, for instance, isboosting the market for video post-production equipment.andM;* User interfaces.andP;  The rise in popularity of the graphical user interfacemeans that more and more workers will expect more graphics in their dailywork.andP;  Apple's increasing emphasis on integration with mainframes and thespread of Microsoft's Windows 3.0 will continue the growth of graphicsliteracy.andP;  Other telltale signs indicate people are using graphics more thanever: the still-brisk sales in laser printers and the boom in facsimiledevices and communication.andM;* Technology.andP;  The core technology upon which computer graphics applicationsare built is practically bursting.andP;  Everything from RISC workstations,pen-based computers, and video-conferencing bridges to phosphor plate X-rays,new image compression algorithms, and fiber optic LANs are helping the cause.andM;* Infrastructure.andP;  There is enough &quot;middleware&quot; out there now  visualizationenvironments, object management facilities, multimedia authoring systems,windows-based development tools, data base gateways  - to render computergraphics less esoteric for application developers.andP;  This includes progress inestablishing design, transmission, and graphics interchange standards.andO;Platform vendors' active courting of software vendors with development tools,discounts, and joint marketing arrangements will help spread the computergraphics applications base.andM;It's not all a bed of roses.andP;  Major systems vendors that have lived offEuropean sales for the last few years have seen order rates slow down.andO;Venture capital, as a result of a 60% fall off since 1987 in fund raisings,has all but dried up for startups.andP;  And illness in end-user markets like oiland gas exploration, health care, and automotive manufacturing has led topurchase delays, project cancellations, and a general fear of innovation ininformation systems  - other than general downsizing.andP;  Companies rethinkingthemselves from top to bottom don't have much time to listen to vendorspreach the benefits of their computer graphics products.andM;But this is now a market of over $33 billion, one destined to grow anadditional $11 billion in annual revenues by 1994.andP;  By then the market willbe in spitting distance of $50 billion.andP;  Growth rates with- in the variouscomputer graphics submarkets vary greatly.andP;  But except for a few of thebigger ones  - like the MCAD piece of design engineering - all will showdouble-digit growth over the next five years.andM;What's more, in each of the six major submarkets there are things going on tomake market watchers optimistic about long-term prospects:andM;*  Design engineering.andP;  The migration to solids modeling to support theintegration of CAD with other areas of engineering and the competitivepressures in electronic design.andM;* Visual communications.andP;  The growth in both videoconferencing and private TVnetworks, along with new capability for PC-based video production and digitalvideo.andP;  Later, HDTV.andM;*  AEC design.andP;  Competitive pressures affecting architectural rendering andspeed of design, along with steady pressure to integrate engineering systemswith architectural systems to speed design efforts and cut costs.andM;* Graphic arts.andP;  The opening of the IBM base through Windows 3.0 to desktoppublishing applications, and a growing trend for slicker multimedia businesspresentations and training tools.andM;*  Scientific and medical imaging.andP;  The migration to digital and digitizedX-ray, and the need for general cost cutting to support new governmentmandated limits to health care charges.andP;  Impetus to establish large imagenetworks.andM;*  GIS/mapping.andP;  Dropping data base costs, new user-friendly applicationfront ends, and the huge base of non-automated mapping applications.andM;In short, the computer graphics market has embarked on a long journey thatbegan somewhere in the 1970s and won't end until the turn of the century.andP;  Atthe beginning it was a small, niche submarket of the computer market.andP;  At itsend, the situation may well have reversed itself, to the point whereinformation processing is a submarket of a computer graphics-basedcommunications market.andM;By then, all that corporate hardware and software now used to crunch numbersand sort data fields in pursuit of corporate accounting and transactionprocessing will provide services to desktop machines running multiplegraphics-rich applications.andM;One of the most important changes that has made all this possible involvedthe broadening of hardware and software platforms.andP;  Proprietary systems usedto dominate the computer graphics market - at least 75% of the market at thebeginning of the 1980s.andP;  By the end of the decade, that percentage haddropped to 45% and would be considerably lower were it not for medicalimaging systems.andM;Taking up the slack is an increase in both dedicated applications on standardhardware and operating systems platforms and graphics embedded ingeneral-purpose applications sharing standard hardware and operating systemplatforms.andM;Once computer graphics applications are conducted on standard platforms itgets difficult to tell where general-purpose systems leave off and dedicatedapplication systems take over.andP;  Plenty of workstation-based CAD systems doword processing or electronic mail, just as many word processing systems nowdo page composition, charting, and manipulation of fonts and graphics.andM;1990 IN REVIEWandM;For lots of reasons that will become clear, 1990 was the year of transitionfor graphics, when they merged with the computing mainstream.andP;  The mostimportant events of the period that combined to produce that change steps areworth citing.andM;*  The introduction of Microsoft Windows 3.0, the runaway success of which(2.5 million licenses in 1990) promises to make even die-hard PC users awareof window-based applications.andM;*  The CAD Framework Initiative, launched in 1989 by a consortium of vendorsand users of electronic design tools, debuted its Procedural Interface (PI),which allows producer tools to transmit design information to consumer tools.andO;In other words, the idea of design &quot;frameworks&quot; emerged fully.andM;* The IBM RS6000 continued its record shipments, bringing IBM back to life asa workstation vendor.andM;* Object management became an accepted technology with the adoption ofsoftware environments like Hewlett-Packard's NewWave and with the increasedavailability of object management software on IBM, Digital, and Sunplatforms.andM;* Stellar Computer and Ardent Computer began their first year of marriagetogether (as Stardent) while Evans andamp; Sutherland withdrew from thevisualization supercomputer market.andM;* A new respect for solids and surface modeling in the MCAE world appeared.andO;The epitome of this may have been a write-up in February's ScientificAmerican on Boeing's use of Catia in the design of the 777.andM;* A number of companies passed significant financial milestones.andP;  SunMicrosystems cracked $2.5 billion on the comeback trail from its firstquarterly loss ever in 1989; Silicon Graphics passed $450 million on a growthspurt powered by its new Power series of RIS C-based systems; SDRC cracked $100 million, showing there's life in finite element analysis; and Intergraphcame within spitting distance of $1 billion.andP;  Adobe broke $150 million, whileAldus broke $100 million.andP;  Cadence Design Systems, catching up on MentorGraphics, sold $200 million worth of IC and EDA software.andM;Also noteworthy is what DIDN'T happen in 1990.andP;  The IBM OS/2 operating systemdidn't catch on, allowing workstations to secure their edge over PCs asplatforms for multiprocessing systems in computer graphics applications (seemore on this item, below).andP;  The &quot;visualization&quot; market and its companionmarket for graphics supercomputers didn't materialize to the extent thatcompany backers hoped, indicating that there are still significant obstaclesto implementing what intuitively seems to be such a good idea.andM;Despite all the hype, multimedia didn't advance as a market all that much,unless you call windowing applications that can mix graphics and text asmultimedia.andP;  And the emergence of desktop video  - not to be confused withPC-based video post production  - remained at a distance, despite the debutby Intel of a DVI (Digital Video Interface) board capable of handlingreal-time video on a LAN.andM;During 1990 the technical workstation confirmed its strategic position overthe personal computer  (IBM, clone, Mac, or Amiga) as the computer graphicsplatform of choice.andP;  Five years ago, when most computer graphics applicationswere host-based, the two platform types anchored about 15% of the market.andO;Autodesk had just begun its incredible run into the PC world, Sun was stillunder a billion dollars, and desktop publishing based on Macs and Intel-basedPCs was just taking off.andP;  Which platform would dominate was in debate.andM;But then the desktop publishing market slowed from blistering to merelysignificant growth, and the price of workstations came way down.andP;  At the sametime, no DOS replacement other than Unix on a workstation came along.andM;Since many of the applications in the computer graphics world derive from ormust work with host-based applications, users tend to prefer systems upwardlyscalable by several orders of magnitude.andP;  Better to start out on a smallworkstation than on a big PC.andP;  The use of Windows 3.0, while it gives DOS anafterlife, only exacerbates the problem of upward migration.andM;In addition, many computer graphics applications  - particularly in CAD/CAE -are being integrated with other applications or perennially increasing theirown computational function.andP;  All of this builds a demand for power and memoryat the edge of PC capabilities.andP;  You may be able to do chip layouts on a PC,but you won't also be able to do significant simulation and design testing atthe same time.andM;Actually, though, the issue will become less a question of hardware platformor even operating system, but rather of which processing paradigm isemployed.andP;  Right now the choices include standalone workstation processing,client-server LAN-based computing, timesharing with desktop presentationservices, or true cooperative computing.andM;Ironically, PCs may well slip back in the computer graphics door as clientsin client-server networks use more powerful workstations as their servers.andM;SUBINDUSTRY PROFILEandM;The computer graphics market, like most others that make up the industry, isnot a monolith, but a collection of submarkets  - some discrete and distinct,most of them overlapping, all of them in turmoil as users, technology, andapplications grow and change.andP;  The most important half-dozen are capsuledbelow.andM;*  Design engineering: mechanical and electrical/electronic CAD/CAM, CAE andindustrial design.andM;The key thrust here continues to be toward solids modeling and 3D graphics inthe mechanical sector along with integration of CAD data bases.andP;  Beyond thatthere's a trend toward integrating CAD and engineering applications.andM;But the market is moving slowly, a result of problems in the automotivemarkets and the slowdown in defense.andP;  The electronic design market, whichsome analysts peg with a 20%-plus growth rate, is simultaneously enervated bystandards work going on to link disparate proprietary platforms and a trendtoward buying software that runs on multiple platforms.andP;  As an example of thelatter, Cadence Design Systems, formed from the merger of ECAD, Inc., and SDASystems, Inc., several years back, is now the number two player in EDA afterMentor Graphics.andP;  Cadence's strategy has always been to be a software vendorrunning on multiple platforms.andP;  The company also pioneered the use of CAD&quot;frameworks.&quot;andM;Visual communications: presentations, multimedia, training, entertainment,and video production.andM;Perhaps the overriding trends in this market are the digitization of video,the increased use of CD/ROM in training and even some interactive video, thegrowth of corporate TV networks requiring video production services andproducts, and the use of smaller, platform-based products to assist in videoproduction.andM;The Amiga 3000, for instance, outfitted with a NewTek VideoToaster board($1,595) can, for under $15,000, handle video post-production chores thatused to require proprietary systems costing $50,000 and up.andM;Another interesting trend is the use of video conferencing  -spurred on bythe availability of wider bandwidth switched circuits from carriers (switched384 kbps) and lower price equipment, like that made by PictureTel.andP;  Videoconferencing rooms are almost always outfitted with graphics processingequipment of higher resolution and transmission speed than facsimile.andM;One interesting nonevent: a multimedia boom.andP;  Although much discussed andsupported now in product by Microsoft, the multimedia market is still boundby the ability of users to come up with applications and authoring systems tosupport application development.andM;Architectural design: AEC CAD, facilities management and planning.andM;The immediate trend here is the collapse of the real estate market, which isaffecting the demand for architectural services and equipment and softwaresold to the market.andP;  Fortunately, few firms can operate now without theirautomated tools.andP;  The key technology trend: continued use of PC andMacintosh-based tools.andM;The introduction of Windows 3.0 into this market might make for someinteresting trends, since architects have traditionally favored Macs whileengineers have favored PCs.andP;  Windows may get some architects to switch over.andM;Graphic Arts: electronic publishing, illustration, design, prepress, finearts.andM;The major trend here is the (not surprising) slower growth of desktoppublishing to under 20% a year.andP;  For the second year in a row we have loweredour expectations for the market based on our feeling that the electronicpublishing market is pretty much out of first-time buyers and that migrationto color will be slower than many vendors and professionals expect.andP;  Themarket is still big and still growing  - just not to gargantuan proportions.andM;Science and medicine: visualization, imaging, and graphics-based analysis.andO;This is a market dominated in size by medical imaging (CAT, MR, andultrasound) but in growth by scientific visualization and digitized medicalimaging.andM;Major trends in the medical side include the emergence of PACS (picturearchiving and communication systems), remote imaging and radiologyapplications, and digital capture of previously film-or analog-based images.andO;The PACS and remote radiology markets are still minuscule, but majorhospitals are making commitments to convert to digital imaging to save costsand increase efficiency.andP;  Once the first generation of the technology worksout and a few showcases are in place, the market could take off.andP;  Thescientific visualization market, although a disappointment to vendors at themoment, is still  poised for greatness.&quot; More on this later.andM;GIS/mapping: geographic information systems, geophysics, cartography,mapping.andM;Hit from three sides: by low oil prices, which curb exploration efforts;budget problems in state and local government, which curtail budgetcommitments to land use planning; and government apathy toward commercialremote sensing services.andP;  The market is never-the-less growing modestly.andO;Continually falling hardware prices and increasing software capability willhelp the market cross some important price/performance thresholds in the nextfew years.andP;  And the large base of unconverted maps and photographs means thatonce those thresholds are passed, there'll be plenty of work bringingthousands of potential using organizations into modem technology.andM;The need for Stellar and Ardent to join forces, the pull out of Evans andamp;Sutherland from the visualization supercomputer project, and the failure ofmarket entrants to either build a common definition of visualization or makemuch money selling products that look and feel like what it intuitively is,might indicate the visualization market is a flop.andM;On the contrary.andP;  The setbacks faced by companies like Stardent and Evans andamp;Sutherland are merely the setbacks of pioneers.andP;  Stardent is still here, forinstance, and in 1990 Digital Equipment agreed to use its AVS visualizationenvironment.andP;  Eandamp;S is still a vaunted name in computer graphics.andM;But as the original NSF report on visualization pointed out, what the marketneeds is not only product, but infrastucture, a critical mass, before it cantake off.andP;  That infrastructure is building.andP;  It comes in the algorithms forsimulation, it comes in application development environments and softwaretools, it comes in everpresent 3D hardware platforms, it comes in graphicsstandards, it comes in faster rendering programs, and it comes in theexperiences of pioneering users.andM;A year ago at least one survey revealed a solid majority of current graphicssupercomputers customers happy with their systems  - and that gives us a clueas to the real market potential for visualization.andM;In a larger sense all of computer graphics is visualization, but not alwaysin real-time.andP;  By that token the computer graphics markets, and their servingindustry, are at the forefront of information systems progress.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
