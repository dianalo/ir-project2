Ambassador Ronald Lehman II, the Bush administration's chiefarms negotiator, said the Tooele Army Depot facility, dubbedChemical Disposal System No.1, represents the ``leading edge ofnegotiations'' between the United States and the Soviet Union toeliminate their chemical arsenals.   The ceremony took place on a desolate, sagebrush-strewn plainless than a quarter mile from concrete, dirt-covered igloos housingmore than 40 percent of the nation's aging chemical agent stockpile.   The $212 million CDS1, 48 miles southwest of Salt Lake City,will be the first of eight such U.S. facilities slated to dismantleand incinerate old mustard and nerve gas weapons, many of whichdate to World War II.   The Tooele plant is scheduled for completion in 1992.   Lehman and others said renewed negotiations with the SovietUnion in Geneva have bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimatelydestroying chemical weaponry.   Rep. James V. Hansen, R-Utah, read a statement from PresidentBush, who reiterated his commitment to a joint U.S.-Soviet effortto eliminate both nations' chemical arsenals within the next decade.   ``Today, we take another step along that path,'' Hansen quotedBush as saying. ``The chemical weapons destruction facility to bebuilt at Tooele says to all the world that the United States isdetermined to fulfill its promises, that our people and ourgovernment are committed to halting the spread of chemical weaponsand eliminating their very existence.''   Bush has promised to reduce stockpiles to 20 percent of existingweapons even before any treaty is signed, Hansen added.   Much of that will be accomplished through destruction of therockets, canisters, artillery projectiles and other weaponrycontaining chemical agents. Congress mandated destruction of theweapons for safety reasons in 1985.   Besides Tooele, other U.S. chemical stockpiles are at the PineBluff Arsenal, Ark.; Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Umatilla DepotActivity, Ore.; Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; AberdeenProving Ground, Md.; Pueblo Depot Activity, Colo., andLexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.   The eight-building CDS1 complex will be adjacent to igloos wherenearly 800 chemical weapons, many of them leaking, are stored.Construction of the facility will employ about 300 people and isexpected to begin later this year.   From February 1992 until January 1993, the 350 people needed tooperate the plant will be trained and simulated tests will beconducted. Destruction of the weapons will begin in February 1993and take about four years, the Army said.</TEXT></DOC>
