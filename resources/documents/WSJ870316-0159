(AMCC).    As advisers to AMCC, we want to make it clear that AMCC has never proposed to buy Fairchild in its entirety. AMCC's actual expressed interest is and has been strictly in the relatively small segment of Fairchild that produces high-performance products used in U.S. military electronics equipment and other high-technology applications, such as supercomputers. AMCC's product line is compatible with the products of this small Fairchild segment.    We are confident that AMCC has adequate financial and managerial resources to succeed in this endeavor.
