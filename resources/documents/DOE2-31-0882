To determine temperature andconcentration dependences of the mutual diffusion coefficients the methodof computerized simulation is used. The correlation dependence betweenthe values of the diagonal diffusion coefficients, activation energyand frequency factor on the one hand, and solidus temperature, on theother hand is determined.</TEXT></DOC>
