(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When 18th century naturalistWilliam Bartram explored Florida's St. Johns River he foundalligators so plentiful ``it would have been easy to have walkedacross their heads had the animals been harmless.''   The reptiles' numbers and menacing jaws proved no protectionagainst the human onslaught that pushed the Florida alligator todangerously low numbers and onto the federal endangered specieslist by the late 1960s.   ``There were times when the fate of the alligator didn't looktoo good,'' said Allan Woodward, head of the alligator researchunit for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.   But now there are so many alligators, thanks to preservation andthe animals' resilience, that a month-long alligator hunting seasonopens Thursday.   ``I can say we've all been pleasantly surprised by how fast thegator has rebounded,'' Woodward said.   Florida's first widespread hunt in 26 years _ small-scaleexperimental hunts have been held since 1981 _ sets a maximum of 15alligators for each of 238 license recipients who were selected atrandom from 5,000 applications.   It's not just sport. Alligator hides sell for $42 a foot andtheir meat brings about $5 a pound.   Wildlife experts credit strong anti-poaching laws adopted in1970 as instrumental in nearly doubling the alligator's populationin Florida to 1 million and removing the animal from the endangeredspecies list in 1977.   The Lacey Act sought to close off lucrative markets for poachersby making interstate transportation of alligator products a federaloffense. Poaching is now only a state offense, with a maximumpenalty of a $1,000 fine or a year in jail.   ``We made a pretty good living off the gators before theystopped it,'' said Norm Padgett, 66, who will guide some of thenovices in the hunt.   Alligators' adaptability also contributed to theirproliferation, Woodward said.   They can generally tolerate encroachment of homes and highways.As marsh and deep-water areas diminish, alligators have learned tothrive in man-made canals or even roadside ditches and golf coursewater hazards.   ``As long as there is food and water and a place to sunthemselves, that's what makes a gator happy,'' Woodward said.   Despite their laconic behavior, they learn quickly to be wary ofhumans, and their keen night vision and acute smell and hearing canmake them an elusive prey.   ``They're not as dumb as some people seem to think. Theirskittishness is an asset for their survival,'' Woodward said.   Officials say the upcoming hunt is confined to areas whereexceptionally high alligator populations could force the animals torelocate or starve.   In Texas, which resumed alligator hunts in 1984, about 1,400gators were taken last year. Louisiana officials reported about23,800 gators were killed last year in the state's 30-day season,which has been held since 1972.   Participants in Florida's hunt _ many of them city dwellers whohave never stalked gators _ will be armed with harpoons and ``bangsticks,'' which fire a cartridge upon impact with a captured gator.Guns are prohibited because the animals often sink after being shot.   ``It's just an adventure that I never thought I'd go on,'' saidThomas Alpern, a free-lance writer from New York City, one of onlytwo non-Florida residents who won licenses. ``I'll just try to havefun and get some gators.''   Alpern will be one of the many inexperienced gator huntershiring veteran trappers as guides.   ``It's a good relationship,'' said Mike Rafferty, whoexterminates nuisance alligators for the state and plans to guideseveral hunters. ``For the new hunters, it's excitement. For me,it's business.''</TEXT></DOC>
