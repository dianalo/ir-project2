The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Indexpartially erased a 0.4 percent increase in January. Analysts saidit provided further evidence that inflation remains tame.   For the first two months of 1988, wholesale prices have beenincreasing at an annual rate of 1.1 percent _ just half of lastyear's 2.2 percent rise.   However, the producer index does not show two categories inwhich price increases have been the most pronounced _ services andimported goods. These items are included in the companion ConsumerPrice Index, which was up 4.4 percent in 1987.   At the wholesale level, food prices overall fell 1.1 percentafter a 1.7 percent rise a month earlier. Energy prices were alsodown, but the 0.8 percent decline trailed January's 4.5 percentdrop.   Gasoline prices fell 0.5 percent after an 8.4 percent plunge inJanuary. Home heating oil costs were off 4.2 percent after a 6.2percent drop. Natural gas prices, up 0.8 percent in January, fell1.4 percent.   As for food, vegetable prices, which had increased 16.2 percentin January, dropped 26.3 percent, a decline largely driven by thedrop in lettuce prices. The price of lettuce had tripled betweenOctober and November because of shortages and crop infestation inCalifornia.   Fruits, down 3.0 percent in January, fell an additional 3.5percent.   Beef and veal prices were up 0.3 percent after a 3.4 percentrise in January. Pork costs, up 13.2 percent in the previous month,rose just 0.2 percent.   Coffee prices fell 0.8 percent for the second consecutive month.Alcoholic beverage costs were up 0.8 percent after rising 0.1percent in the preceding month.   Subtracting the usually volatile energy and food categories,wholesale prices for all other goods increased a relatively sedate0.3 percent.   ``The stability which we continue to see in the (producer) indexis very good news,'' said Dirk Van Dorgen, president of theNational Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. ``We don't need tohave to cope with a vexing inflation problem on top of all theother basic economic problems we've got to deal with.''   The producer index had declined as recently as last December,when it was down 0.4 percent. The 0.2 percent February decline, ifcontinued for 12 consecutive months, would yield an annualprice-change rate of minus 2.2 percent.   The teaming up of lower energy and food costs in February``really was a break for the consumer,'' said Sandra Shaber, senioreconomist for the Futures Group, a management consulting company.``But there have been some strong increases in some services,medical care, housing costs, which are not in the PPI.''   ``We can't anticipate a continuing decline in lettuce prices,unfortunately,' she added.   Friday's report again showed there was little justification forworries of a resurgence in inflation, analysts agreed.   ``The news is clearly that we have very stable inflationrates,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist for DataResources Inc. ``We think energy prices will come back a little bitin the next few months because they have dropped so far. But thebase inflation rate is going to remain very stable.''   Other wholesale price activity in February included:   _Prices for new automobiles fell 0.2 percent after a 0.2 percentgain in January.   _Capital equipment costs were up 0.2 percent for the third monthin a row.   _Children's clothing prices fell 2.2 percent. Men's clothingcosts fell 0.1 percent. Men's apparel prices gained 0.5 percent.   _Tobacco prices gained 0.9 percent after a 1.2 percent drop inJanuary.   February's decline brought the overall wholesale price index to105.9. This means that a selection of wholesale goods costing $100during a 1982 base period would have cost $105.90 last month. Theindex itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are otherfigures in the report.   The Labor Department recently switched from a 1967 base periodfor both its producer and consumer price index figures.   Using the 1967 base, the February index would have been 297.3.That compares to a 292.3 index in February 1988. In other words,goods costing $100 in 1967 would have cost $292.30 in February 1987and $297.30 in February 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
