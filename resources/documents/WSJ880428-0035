At the outset of their annual meeting yesterday, Mr. Mulroney offered Mr. Reagan a set of ideas designed to break an impasse in U.S.-Canadian negotiations on an agreement to fight acid rain. But Canadian officials acknowledged later that the suggestions represented a restatement of an earlier Canadian proposal, and U.S. aides said they doubted the ideas could lead to a breakthrough before Mr. Mulroney ends his visit here today.    Though Mr. Mulroney's meeting at the White House was conducted in a generally convivial atmosphere, the Canadian prime minister made clear in remarks to reporters that he is piqued by the lack of progress on the acid-rain issue. And he continued to press hard for an agreement in remarks to a joint session of Congress made after his White House visit.    Mr. Mulroney noted that Canada has embarked on a plan to cut by 50% its own emissions of sulfur dioxide, an ingredient of acid rain, in eastern Canada. He said this would reduce by more than 50% the amount of acid rain Canada exports to the U.S., and asserted: &quot;We ask nothing more than this from you.&quot;    The two leaders agreed last year that their countries would negotiate a joint plan to fight acid rain, which occurs when certain air pollutants are washed down from the skies. Canada asserts that sulfur-dioxide emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants and factories in the Midwest harm Canadian lakes and forests.    But the effort to negotiate a pact is stalled because Canada wants an agreement containing a specific timetable for reducing emissions from U.S. plants that create acid rain, while the U.S. wants an accord limited to further studies of acid rain and development of technologies used to fight it.    The U.S. was more accommodating on the issue of submarines. Mr. Reagan told Mr. Mulroney that he would approve the use of U.S. nuclear-propulsion technology in British-made attack submarines if Canada decides to buy the British boats. Canada is debating whether to buy a group of 10 to 12 of these submarines from Britain or France.    The British submarines under consideration, known as Trafalgar-class submarines, use U.S. nuclear technology that has been transferred to Britain under a U.S.-British agreement. Britain needs approval from the U.S. to sell submarines with the technology. Mr. Reagan assured Mr. Mulroney that he will allow transfer of the technology, though U.S. officials noted that Congress would have to review his approval if Canada ultimately chooses to buy the British submarines.    But senior Canadian officials said acid rain dominated the talks. As expected, they said, President Reagan argued that sulfur-dioxide emissions already are declining in the U.S. because of air-pollution controls. But Canadian officials asserted that those declines aren't enough. U.S. aides said Mr. Reagan pledged to consider the ideas Mr. Mulroney presented.    Mr. Mulroney's visit came as the U.S. refused, at talks in Geneva on an international air-pollution treaty, to limit its emissions of nitrogen oxide flowing north of the border into Canada. The U.S. wants credit for progress it has made in reducing nitrogen-oxide emissions in recent years. It proposes a provision under which it could increase its emissions, even as some other countries would freeze their emissions at their current levels. </TEXT></DOC>
