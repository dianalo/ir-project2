Appeal Should Answer Question</HEAD><DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man convicted of poaching morethan 1,000 eggs of endangered sea turtles has filed an appeal thatputs a new twist on an old question: What came first, the turtle orthe egg?   James A. Bivens was convicted in March of poaching 1,088 eggs.He was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $500, plus $100 foreach egg taken from the beach on Singer Island. The fine amounts to$109,300.   In court documents, Bivens' attorney argued that the fine isillegal because state law allows a judge to levy a $100 fine ``perunit of marine life.''   But when does marine life begin?   ``An egg, according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes alife when it is hatched ... is not a turtle,'' Assistant PublicDefender Louis Carres wrote. ``Hence the universal question: Whichcame first, the chicken or the egg?''   Bivens is appealing the County Court fine to Circuit Court. Lastweek, a three-judge panel set Jan. 18 for oral arguments.   Prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new tothem, but ridiculous nevertheless.   ``If you kill an egg, it's not going to become a turtle,obviously,'' said Barbara Schroeder, sea turtle recoverycoordinator for the state Department of Natural Resources.</TEXT></DOC>
