In Beirut, the Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella group forkidnappers of Westerners in Lebanon, rejected an Israeli swap offerfor a kidnapped Shiite cleric and two companions and said Israeland the United States were responsible for any retaliation againstWestern hostages by Islamic groups.   ``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul-KarimObeid and his two colleagues be released,'' Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, said in a statement.   Shamir, asked whether Israel was engaged in contacts with Shiitegroups in Lebanon, Shamir told reporters ``there are permanentcontacts with various factors about the release of the hostages.''   Israel radio said the contacts were related to Israel's offerMonday to trade all the Shiite prisoners it is holding for threeIsraeli soldiers and the foreign hostages held in Lebanon.   Also today, sources said there were sharp divisions in thegovernment over its decision to abduct Obeid. The action also hasdrawn fire from officials in Washington.   The Israeli offer was made as Shiite extremists in Lebanon saidthey hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins because Israelrefused to release a Shiite Moslem cleric its commandos kidnappedFriday from his south Lebanon home.   The captors of another American later said they would kill himunless Israel frees Obeid, who Israeli sources say was involved inHiggins' abduction.   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, suggested that the contacts withShiite groups were indirect, through the International Red Crossand the U.S. government. He would not say if there had been anydirect talks.   Israel is believed to be holding 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems inIsrael as well as about 300 in south Lebanon, security sources inLebanon said on condition of anonymity.   Shamir defended Israel's decision to kidnap Obeid and two of hisaides.   ``The only purpose of our operation was to free our capturedsoldiers. If, at the same time, we manage to set free otherhostages, we will be happy. There is a common interest and acommunal goal with the United States,'' Shamir told reportersoutside an aluminum factory he visited in Jerusalem.   Groups claiming to hold two other hostages, American JosephCicippio and Anglican envoy Terry Waite of Britain, have threatenedto execute them unless Israel frees Obeid.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who met with U.S. AmbassadorWilliam Brown, told the parliament's Foreign Affairs and DefenseCommittee today he believed the groups may be making threatsagainst hostages who were already dead, defense sources said.   The U.S. reaction has included strong criticism of Israel'sfailure to coordinate its operation or consider the possibilitythat American hostages could be harmed.   After the claim of Higgins' death was made, Senate Republicanleader Bob Dole of Kansas criticized the abduction of Obeid:``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelisone of these days would be refreshing.''   White House officials avoided direct criticism of Israel, butpress secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is fair to say thatmany people do share the senator's concerns.'' He would notelaborate.   Shamir played down the criticism.   ``I understand the worry expressed by some in the United Statessuch as Dole,'' said Shamir. ``I can understand it, but I think themajority of public opinion understands that our purpose was to freehostages, to free people who are in the hands of terrorists.''   Despite mounting pressure, however, Israeli officials said thegovernment was unlikely to free Obeid unless the pro-Iranian Shiitegroups agree to Israel's offer of a prisoner exchange.   ``We have made a proposal,'' said Deputy Foreign MinisterBejamin Netanyanu said on Israel TV's midnight news. ``They cananswer it, but they must understand that we will not give in to thedictates of their blackmail.''   An official close to Shamir added that unless there was a swap:``I don't believe that we will release Obeid.''   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed therewere internal divisions over the abduction of Obeid and thesubsequent handling of the evolving crisis.   ``Maybe we underestimated the extent of the media coverage ofthis crisis,'' said one Israeli official.   Others criticized government planners for failing to appreciatethe sensitivity to Moslems of kidnapping a Shiite clergyman.   One member of the Cabinet, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of theleft-leaning Labor Party, disclosed that he had voted against theabduction at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday in which the operation wasapproved by a 11-1 vote.   A Shahal aide who demanded anonymity said the minister believedthe reaction of Hezbollah was too unpredictable to make such anoperation worthwhile.   The official confirmed a report in the daily Al Hamishmar thatthere was also division in the army.   Israeli media said the Cabinet failed to consider thepossibility that Hezbollah would retaliate against Western hostagesinstead of Israeli POWs.   ``It is now clear that in the Cabinet meeting in which thekidnapping was approved, a script was not presented to theministers which took into account the execution of the foreignhostages in Lebanon,'' Israel radio said.</TEXT></DOC>
