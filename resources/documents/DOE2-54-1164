The priority sequence of the markets whichmight be served by such a project would be: local loads in the CanadianMaritime Provinces; local loads in contiguous areas of Canada, mainlyin Quebec; and loads located in the northeast USA. Forecast loads aregiven for each of these markets and consideration is given to possibletidal power plant operation starting in 1990. Generating facilities neededto meet load requirements during the review period were derived froman examination of alternative generation plans with and without tidalpower schemes. Analysis was also made of the transmission needs to conveythe projected output to local and remote markets; new transmission linesneeded would be added, if possible, on existing rights of way. The potentialfor tidal power absorption by the 3 markets was evaluated according toa simplified approach, based on annual load and tidal output duration.Results show that local and export markets are large enough to utilizethe output from large tidal power plants. To serve these export arkets,extra high voltage transmission lines would be required to both Quebecand New England. The economic viability of a 7000 MW plant is whollydependent on the export markets, as only 20% of the raw tidal outputcould be absorbed locally by 1990. 11 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
