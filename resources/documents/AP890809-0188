Oil Spill</HEAD><BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The captain of a Greek-flagged tankerthat ran aground and spilled 300,000 gallons of heating oil offRhode Island in June pleaded innocent Wednesday to two state felonycounts.   Iakovos Georgudis, 43, was released on $20,000 personalrecognizance by Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Caldarone, saidThomas Connell, spokesman for the attorney general's office.   Georgudis was indicted by a state grand jury last month oncharges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harborpilot aboard the World Prodigy when approaching Narragansett Bay.He has admitted he erred by failing to wait for a pilot before histanker grounded on Brenton Reef on June 23.   In a related development, a hearing was set for next week inU.S. District Court in Providence on federal misdemeanor chargesagainst Georgudis.   Attorneys for Georgudis and U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almonddeclined to comment on whether the hearing before U.S. Judge ErnestC. Torres next Wednesday would involved a plea bargain Almondoutlined last week.   ``That's up to the judge as to what comes up,'' said Thomas H.Walsh, a lawyer for Ballard Shipping Co., which owns the WorldProdigy.   On Friday, Almond said a plea bargain was being discussed thatwould involve one misdemeanor charge each against the captain andBallard Shipping, which has not been charged with anything.   Walsh attended a closed conference Wednesday with the judge.Neither he, Almond nor Georgudis' attorney, Peter DiBiase, wouldsay what the session was about. DiBiase also declined Wednesday tocomment on the plea agreement.   Georgudis is free on $50,000 bail on two federal pollutioncharges. As a condition of that bail he was required to surrenderhis passport and remain in Rhode Island, Massachusetts or New York.   Almond would not identify the penalties that the governmentplanned on recommending in the federal plea. Each of the chargescarries a potential one-year jail term and fines totaling twice thecleanup costs.   Georgudis faces a maximum of $20,000 in fines and 13 months injail if convicted of the state charges.</TEXT></DOC>
