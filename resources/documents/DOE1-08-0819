<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-0819 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new thermophilic fungus, CL240, was selected in a screening programfor its ability to produce a very broad spectrum of polysaccharolyticactivities: cellulases, various hemicellulases, beta glucanases, amyloglucosidase...All these enzymes are stable at 70 degrees C or more. The specific activityof the cellulolytic complex on crystalline cellulose, and the productivityof wild type strains compare favourably with those of Trichoderma reesei.The aim of this research proposal is the screening of mutants of thisstrain whose specific activity of extracellular proteins toward crystallinecellulose will be higher than that of cellulase from Trichoderma reesei.Cellulolytic enzymes will be purified by preparative chromatography andthe best combination of each component to give an increase of the specificactivity will be determined. The search of mutants will then be orientedtoward a specific increase of components such as exoglucanases whoseconcentration is limiting in the cellulolytic complex. Selection of mutantswill be carried out by conventional genetic procedure using adapted screens.The efficiency of enzyme preparations from different mutants in convertingsteam exploded corn stovers to alcohol fermentable sugars will be assessed.</TEXT></DOC>
