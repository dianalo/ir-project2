(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fourteen workers at the troubled SavannahRiver nuclear weapons plant were exposed to tiny amounts ofplutonium outside buildings, and five went home with the potentiallydeadly contaminant on their shoes, officials said.   The soles of their shoes effectively screened out any harmfulradiation, and none of the workers' homes were found to haveunusually high levels of radiation, plant officials said Wednesday.   ``Approximately 120 small spots of contamination were found, mostof which were found on the ground,'' said Becky Apter, a spokeswomanfor Du Pont, which operates the plant for the U.S. Department ofEnergy.   The ground contamination in the chemical separations area hasbeen cleaned up but decontamination was continuing on the roof ofone building, she said.   However, officials said they did not know how the plutonium gotoutside the buildings in the area, or its exact source.   The plutonium could have come from a building's stack, whichvents the building's air filter system, or from improper handling ofwaste material or moving of nuclear material from one building toanother, said Du Pont Health Protection Superintendent Bill Reinig.   The amount of contamination was small _ about one microcurie.   ``You could pick up all the spots, you could eat it all and youwould still be less than 10 percent of the federal limit ofplutonium in the body,'' Reinig said.   Michael Lowe, a spokesman for the environmental watchdog groupGreenpeace, charged that the Oct. 26 incident was just anotherindication of poor safety standards at the plant, located across theSavannah River from Augusta, Ga.   ``Here's a good example of where normal procedures, which wouldbe considered arguably safe, would be safe if the DOE was diligentwith safety,'' he said. ``How many operations at Savannah River aday are performed that have the same institutional problems?''   The plant is the largest complex in the government's nuclearweapons production system. Its three reactors were the only ones inthe nation still producing the major nuclear weapons materials,plutonium and tritium, before they were shut down by DOE in Aprilfor safety reasons.   Some congressmen have expressed concerns over continuing healthproblems at Savannah River and other nuclear weapons plants. Lastmonth, the Physicians for Social Responsibility called for thecreation of a national medical board to assess the problems.   At another plant, in Fernald, Ohio, state officials saidWednesday that more radioactive radium was released into the GreatMiami River from uranium processing than earlier realized,increasing the potential health threat to nearby residents.   After the Savannah River's Oct. 26 incident, workers conducted asurvey and detected low levels of plutonium between two buildings,and on the roof of one of them, said Ms. Apter.   Reinig said plutonium emits radioactive alpha rays, small amountsof which can be ``completely shielded by a thin piece of paper.''   ``The alpha (rays) can be stopped by the soles of the shoes,'' hesaid. ``Employees sustained no radiation dose. It doesn't become ahazard unless it is ingested into the body.''   He said there was ``no indication whatsoever'' that any of thematerial was ingested, and monitoring devices indicate nocontamination was carried off the site in the air or water.   Ms. Apter said Du Pont investigators checked 200 workers andfound that nine who were on the site at the time had picked upcontamination. They later found five more had picked upcontamination but had gone home before it was detected.   Their homes were checked, and no radioactivity was found, Ms.Apter said.   In Ohio, the new information about the river contamination was indocuments filed by the Department of Energy as part of the defensethe department has prepared for National Lead of Ohio Inc., theplant's former operator, in a class-action lawsuit.   ``It's definitely new stuff,'' said Graham Mitchell, a spokesmanfor the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.   Residents of the Fernald community filed the lawsuit in U.S.District Court in Cincinnati earlier this year, contending theoperator allowed radioactive uranium dust to escape from the plant,damaging their health and property.</TEXT></DOC>
