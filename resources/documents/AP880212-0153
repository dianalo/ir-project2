From rhinestone-studded undies to briefs fitted with music boxesto a club that delivers perfumed, gift-wrapped panties, thelingerie industry is shedding its cotton-drawer image andexploiting the holiday of the heart.   Some insiders say that for this special sub-category of women'sclothing retailers, Valentine's Day is second only to Christmaswhen it comes to racking up holiday sales. Their most compellingsales pitch is that no matter how scanty, lingerie lasts longerthan roses and isn't fattening like chocolates.   Lila Williams thinks her Panty-of-the-Month Club covers theterritory when it comes to imaginative love tokens. ThisBrooklyn-based entrepreneur promises to put one pair of scented,gift-wrapped designer briefs in the mailbox for $16.50 each month.   Men are the main purchasers of her hidden couture _ sheestimates 95 percent of the subscriptions to her panty club havebeen bought by men.   With more than 1,000 customers, Williams makes sure the packageand panty are ``color-coded to the season.'' Last year's AprilEaster pair had a ``furry, detachable bunny tail;'' the July``firework special'' was, of course red, white and blue; and NewYear's pair was silver silk.   Williams said she hand-dyed 600 pieces of lingerie to a mintygreen for last St. Patrick's Day, her third-biggest sales period.This year, however, she found emerald satin panties trimmed withchampagne lace. And don't forget the optional ``Erin Go Bra'' bra.   But Frederick's of Hollywood's $10 pair of musical panties is atough contender.   Cleverly hidden amid what little red-and-white lace makes upthis undergarment, which a company spokeswoman described as ``verysmall,'' is a tiny computer box that can chirp out a rendition of``Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' at the pull of a string.   Though long considered outside the realm of high-class lingerie,Frederick's has managed to spawn 150 stores nationwide and postannual sales in the $58 million range, spokeswoman Ellen Appel said.   For those who want to be a bit more extravagant, Bloomingdale'sin New York is selling rhinestone-studded red silk panties for $100a pair. The matching camisole carries a $250 price tag.   ``The idea of sleaziness is leaving the American scene,'' saidCarol Palmer, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``Justlook at how the square footage for lingerie in department stores isincreasing.''   Indeed, the last few years have seen a ``coming out of lingerieas a real fashion item,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail marketingconsultant and publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report.   Over a year ago, for example, Bloomingdale's flagship Manhattanstore moved its lingerie department from the more pedestrian groundfloor to upstairs, next to designer clothing, a spokeswoman said.   ``The industry is growing rather fast,'' Barnard said, pointingto The Limited Inc. as one major retailer that has focused onlingerie with its 237-store Victoria's Secret chain.   ``It's likely we'll see more and more stores affiliated'' withlingerie spinoffs, Barnard predicted.   The actual size of the industry is difficult to gauge, partlybecause many of the players are private companies and because theindustry does not have a trade association.   But Ray McInerney, publisher of Intimate Fashion News, said hispublication reported 1986 intimate apparel sales totaled $5.6billion.   While trailing sleepwear, which posted 1986 sales of $1.42billion, and bras, which totaled $1.34 billion, sales of pantiesreached $1.1 billion and ranked ahead of robes, slips and girdles.   Williams finds panties the most essential item. She notes theycome in ``the most colors and styles, they're the least expensiveand most needed'' piece of intimate apparel.   ``This year has spurred a major growth in pants,'' said LisaGoldstein, fashion editor for intimate apparel at Women's WearDaily. She says there's a ``silhouette to fit any figure,'' frombikinis to petits pants.   Even the G-string and its minisculely more generous sister, the``thong'' panty, continue to rack up sales. ``I thought they wouldbe a flash in the pan, but Christian Dior and Lily of France aredoing a very big business in them,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
