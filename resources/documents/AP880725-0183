He told a news conference his policies were poorly understood byWashington and the ``nationalist and progressive'' orientation ofhis government was misinterpreted. As a result, the United Statesstood by as the coup proceeded, Manigat said.   Manigat came to Caracas on Friday from his exile home in Miami.He is campaigning to gain world support for a democratic front ofHaitian politicians aimed at restoring democracy to Haiti.   ``Finally I can say that various officials involved in the coupare known and perceived as friends of the U.S.,'' Manigat said.   He went on, ``I was recently informed by a high-level U.S.official that in the CIA and the Pentagon there was a lot ofconfusion and doubt regarding the orientation of our government,and that they were not convinced when we called it nationalist andprogressive.   ``It seems like another error of my government was to want toremove the Haitian police from the army and put ... (the police)under the Justice Ministry ... This was interpreted by somemilitary officials, and by those who see through their eyes, as aweakening of the army.''   Manigat said that when he left Haiti for the Dominican Republicfollowing the May 19 military coup, someone asked him if he hadconsulted with the United States before trying to remove Lt. Col.Henri Namphy, who removed Manigat instead.   ``Don't you know that you can't change any army commanderwithout first hearing the opinion of the U.S. Embassy?'' the personsaid, according to Manigat.   Manigat gave no details about the individual.   The desposed leader called for the world's democracies torepudiate publicly Namphy's military regime.   Manigat said he will seek Venezuela's support in meetings withPresident Jaime Lusinchi and others before returning to Miami onFriday and will meet with other Haitian politicians this weekend inMiami.   Manigat spent 1978-86 in exile in Venezuela during therepressive Duvalier era in Haiti, and developed close contacts withmembers of the Social Christian Party.   Namphy headed a three-man junta that took over the Haitiangovernment in February 1986, when dictator Jean-Claude Duvalierfled into exile. Manigat was elected last January in elections thatmany Haitians claimed were rigged by the army.   Manigat placed Namphy under house arrest after overridingNamphy's orders for changes in the army. Soldiers loyal to Namphyfreed him June 19 and Namphy deposed Manigat, who was put on aplane to neighboring Dominican Republic the following day.</TEXT></DOC>
