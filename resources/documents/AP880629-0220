A scheduled report by the head of the foreign relationscommittee was postponed at a time of conflict between the twoSoviet bloc allies over Romania's treatment of its ethnic Hungarianminority.   On Tuesday, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate in theTransylvanian city of Cluj-Napoca and ordered its staff out of thecountry.   Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi said he would have no commentuntil later in the week.   The Parliament, expected to discuss economic reform and makesignificant changes in the government, began meeting for the firsttime Wednesday under new Premier Karoly Grosz. He led a newgeneration of Communist leaders into power during a national partyconference last month.   Parliament members elected Bruno F. Straub, 74, as the nation'spresident, a largely ceremonial post. Straub, the first presidentwho is not a party member, was nominated the party's CentralCommittee last week.   Istvan Stadinger, party candidate for speaker, was voted inafter Zoltan Kiraly, one of the most liberal legislators, started adebate by saying there should be more than one candidate.   Kiraly was expelled from the party in April, apparently for hisassociations with independent reformers. He proposed that aparliamentary group of party and non-party members discuss thequesion multiple nominations.   Another deputy, Csaba Csangradi, said votes by secret ballotwere not enough and ``the practice of democracy requiresalternatives.''   He proposed the mayor of Budapest, Pal Ivanyi, as an alternatecandidate for speaker but other deputies objected because Ivanyi isnot a parliament member.   Two legislators who were proposed as alternative candidatesdeclined. Peter Horn and Istvan Gajdos apparently feared they wouldbe disciplined by the party.   Kiraly suggested the fall session discuss the issue. The debateended when, with only 17 negative votes and 16 abstentions, themembers decided to vote on Standiger and the deputy speaker asplanned, with a secret ballot.   Standiger was elected by a vote of 222 in favor and an unusuallyhigh 129 against, with three abstentions.   The membership also approved the appointment of leading reformerImre Pozsgay to the newly created office of minister of state.Pozsgay said one of his main goals would be to build cooperationand confidence between the government and legislature.   Also Wednesday, parliament was presented with a petition for analternative to military service, according to reports fromdissidents and the official news agency MTI.   The East-West Dialogue Network, an independent group, collectedat least 790 signatures demanding civilian service forconscientious objectors, the reports said. Most conscientiousobjectors now are imprisoned.</TEXT></DOC>
