This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The requirement for submitting a Form BXA-699P as setforth in andSection;771.19 supersedes the requirement for a letter requestfor export authorization for non-returned aircraft (approved by the Officeof Management and Budget under Control Number 0694-0039). The Form BXA-699Pis approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number0694-0010. Public reporting for this collection of information is estimatedto average 25 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, andcompleting and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regardingthis burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Office of Security andManagement Support, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget,Paperwork Reduction Project 0694-0010, Washington, DC 20503.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire this rule to be published in proposed form because this rule doesnot impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis.
