Based on this authority, OCHAMPUS has conducteda demonstration using a case management system to control the deliveryof mental health services, specifically including selected providers undercontract and at financial risk. This at-risk model involves a change fromthe current CHAMPUS recognized mental health care delivery system by incorporatingthe use of partial hospitalization and other alternative delivery modelsas a means of reducing utilization of higher cost inpatient services. OCHAMPUShas determined that this innovative approach offers some potential forimproving the quality and cost effectiveness of mental health care underCHAMPUS, and therefore, the demonstration will be extended. Initial noticeof this demonstration was given in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 3, l986, with a clarification publishedon June 28, 1988. Since there is a new contractor continuing the demonstration,this notice is being published to set forth the general parameters of thedemonstration in one document and provide additional background informationthat may be of interest to providers or CHAMPUS beneficiaries; consequently,the two previous notices are superseded by this publication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Michael J.

However, any provider renderingcare and any beneficiary receiving mental health care in the stated zipcode areas are subject to the FHC Choice case management guidelines andprovisions. Care of any beneficiary delivered outside the stated zip codeareas by any authorized OCHAMPUS provider is subject to the normal rulesand regulations of the CHAMPUS program and their treatment is not subjectto the limitations of the demonstration. Conversely, mental health caredelivered in the demonstration area to any CHAMPUS beneficiary domiciledoutside the demonstration area is subject to the limitations, provisions,and guidelines governing the demonstration project. Services included in the demonstration are full inpatient, partial hospitalization,residential treatment, and outpatient mental health care. Custodial anddomiciliary care cases are not payable under CHAMPUS. Services coveredunder the contract include: inpatient institutional services which includeroom and board, nursing, a setting that protects the patient and others,crisis intervention, drugs and medicine, special therapy, except as otherwiseexcluded by the CHAMPUS regulation. Emergency and other medical and psychologicalservices are covered when and as authorized by FHC Choice provided theyare directly related to the diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms andrendered by a member of the institution's medical and/or professional staff(salaried or contractual). Other covered settings include: partial hospitalizationservices, which differ from inpatient institutional services only to theextent that the patient does not require the fully sheltered environmentof the 24 hours inpatient institutional setting; residential treatmentcenter services which include all of the inpatient institutional services(except the acute care setting), plus therapeutically related educational,recreational and social activity services; other general services deemedmedically and psychologically appropriate to the age and condition of thepatient. Additionally, coverage is provided for inpatient and outpatientprofessional services including individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy,family or conjoint psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, psychological testingand assessment, administration of psychotropic drugs, convulsive and subconvulsiveshock treatments, collateral visits; inpatient, partial hospitalizationand outpatient services for active treatment of alcohol and drug abuse,subject to the provisions and limitations of CHAMPUS Regulation, DOD 6010.8-R,Chapter 4 (32 CFR 199.4). Inpatient institutional and professional servicesrendered in excess of sixty days are not reimbursable, except when approvedby FHC Choice on the basis of a request of the patient and meeting thecriteria in the CHAMPUS Policy Manual. This same criteria is discussedbelow under ``Limits of Care''. The Contractor is required to provide adequate access to institutionaland professional providers for all CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries seekingmental health services in the service area. This access must meet the followingcriteria: emergency care within two hours of FHC Choice being notified,if the beneficiary is within the service area when the need occurs; urgentlyneeded care within fourteen hours of FHC Choice being notified; psychiatricdiagnostic interviews for ninety-five percent of all users within seventy-twohours of such a request, unless the needed care is nonroutine. Inpatientand partial hospitalization care and residential treatment care shall beavailable within forty-eight hours of the time that an individual professionalprovider determines the need for such care. Exclusions and limitations to the mental health benefit and to the contractinclude: Aversion therapy for treatment of alcoholism; care directed bya court or other governmental agency unless such care is otherwise medicallyor psychologically necessary to diagnose or treat a covered condition,is at the appropriate level of care to treat the condition and if the beneficiary(or the beneficiary's family) has the legal obligation to pay for the service;educational counseling, vocational counseling and counseling for socioeconomicpurposes; mind expansion or elective psychotherapy such as Erhard SeminarTraining (EST), transcendental meditation, Rolfing and Z-therapy; megavitaminsand orthomolecular psychiatric therapy; miscellaneous ancillary therapymodalities such as art, music, dance and occupational therapy except asincluded by the attending provider in an approved inpatient or partialhospitalization treatment plan; psychoanalysis or psychotherapy as partof education; services of pastoral counselors, or family and child counselors,or marriage counselors unless the patient has been referred to such counselorsby a physician for treatment of a specific problem with the results ofthat treatment to be reported back to the physician who made the referral;general and special education; therapy or counseling for sexual dysfunctionsor sexual inadequacies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Limits of Care</ITAG>(1) <T3>Acute Hospitalization. </T3>The statute (10 U.S.C. 1079) as implementedby the CHAMPUS regulations dictates a limit on acute inpatient mental healthcare of sixty (60) days in any calendar year. If it is anticipated thatdue to the degree of an acute mental disorder or acute exacerbation ofa chronic mental disorder that a patient requires acute hospitalizationbeyond this 60 day limit, then a waiver request must be submitted in writingto the Medical Director of FHC Choice. This written request must documentthe rationale for requesting the waiver, the kind of physical and/or personalloss anticipated if the patient is transferred to a less restrictive treatmentenvironment at the beginning of the extended period, and the anticipateddegree of independence in daily living expected should the extension begranted. The requirements of the statute, regulation and Policy Manualare the controlling documents relating to extensions of benefits beyond60 days in a calendar year. This written request must be received betweenthe 50th and 55th day of hospitalization. (2) <T3>Partial Hospitalization. </T3>The CPA contract provides for a 60 daylimit to partial hospitalization treatment. FHC Choice will allow a waiverof this limitation in special circumstances where a patient has utilizedall partial hospitalization benefits, has regressed in outpatient care,and needs additional partial hospitalization services. The request forwaiver should follow the same procedures as outlined for acute care. (3) <T3>Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency Treatment Programs. </T3>The CHAMPUSRegulation limits alcohol and chemical dependency rehabilitation servicesto three benefit periods in a life time. A benefit period begins with thefirst day of rehabilitation and ends 365 days later. The extent of coveragein each benefit period is limited to 21 days rehabilitation (either inpatientor partial hospitalization), sixty visits for outpatient and 15 visitsfor family therapy. Unused benefits cannot be carried over to subsequentbenefit periods. Stays for detoxification in an alcohol rehabilitationfacility are covered up to a maximum of seven days. Although there is noabsolute limit on the number of admissions for detoxification, repeatedadmissions will be closely monitored to ensure that the inpatient levelof care is medically required. Detoxification treatment days, in additionto inpatient treatment days, will be counted toward the 60 day mental healthinpatient limit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preventive, Consultation and Outreach Service </ITAG>FHC Choice staff will offer consultative and program development servicesto the community which are designed specifically to strengthen existingsupport programs, network services which are already available, and ultimatelyreduce utilization of more expensive forms of mental health services suchas acute inpatient, residential treatment and partial hospitalization.The education/prevention component of the FHC Choice Mental Health Projectdevelops and implements programs demonstrating preventive education andinnovative, early intervention strategies to reduce the need for mentalhealth care which are, therefore, cost effective. Programs range from informationand training supplied to providers on topics which improve provider-military-beneficiaryinterface and services to beneficiaries, seminars for military personnelsuch as Chaplains and Ombudsmen to assist in their critical support roles,to beneficiary workshops coordinated with the military community and familysupport agencies. A wide range of frequently updated information derivedfrom field-based research, input from military caregivers, providers andbeneficiaries as well as ongoing literature review and needs assessmentis available to government representatives and to those involved in themilitary mental health care field as professionals, paraprofessionals orrecipients. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intensive Outpatient Services </ITAG>The development of Brief Therapy programs will be encouraged. Practitionerswill be assisted in efforts to build programs in their outpatient offices,which will be reimbursed at outpatient rates according to special ratesto be determined and designed to meet the needs of targeted groups of patients.<ITAG tagnum="85">Requirements of Participation and Impact of Medicare Linkage Legislationon Noncontracted CPA Providers </ITAG>The categories of professional and institutional providers in the CPA mentalhealth demonstration are CHAMPUS authorized institutional providers andindividual practitioners who are either contracted providers/practitionerswith FHC Choice or non-contracted providers/practitioners. Of the eleveninpatient hospital facilities which provide psychiatric services in thearea, all but one participate in Medicare, and five are FHC Choice contractfacilities. Approximately one-half of the mental health practitioners inthe demonstration area are FHC Choice contract practitioners. All contractproviders/practitioners must participate in CHAMPUS. Contract providers/practitionersagree to accept the FHC Choice contract rate as payment in full for theirservices. Noncontract providers/practitioners who do not participate inCHAMPUS have the option to bill beneficiaries for the difference betweenthe FHC Choice contract rates (CHAMPUS allowable charge) and their billedcharges. (For purposes of this demonstration, the CHAMPUS allowable amountis the FHC Choice contract rate.) A hospital which provides inpatient hospital services for which paymentmay be made under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc is qualified to participate under thistitle and is eligible for payments under this title if it files with theSecretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) an agreement to be a participatingprovider of medical care under any health plan contracted for under section1079 or 1086 of Title 10, or under section 613 of Title, 38, United StatesCode in accordance with admission practices, payment methodology, and amountsas prescribed under joint regulations issued by the Secretary (of Healthand Human Services {HHS}) and by the Secretaries of Defense and Transportation,in implementation of sections 1079 and 1086 of Title 10, United StatesCode.This Medicare linkage legislation requires hospitals that participate inMedicare to also participate on CHAMPUS claims. It applies to noncontractedNorfolk CPA hospital providers that are Medicare participating providers.OCHAMPUS has concluded that it was not clear if, for purposes of a demonstration,the linkage was automatic or notice was required. To avoid disputes OCHAMPUShas concluded that it will give notice before implementing the Medicarelinkage in this demonstration. Initial notice was given in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated June 28, 1988, and the provisions of thatnotice are being continued throughout the life of this demonstration. Consequently,non-contracted hospital providers who are Medicare participating hospitalsare required to participate in CHAMPUS due to the Medicare linkage andmust accept the FHC Choice contract rate and not seek reimbursement fromthe beneficiary for any amount over the FHC Choice contract rate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Provider Services </ITAG>The categories of professional and institutional providers in the CPA mentalhealth demonstration are CHAMPUS authorized institutional providers andindividual practitioners who are either contracted providers/practitionerswith FHC Choice or non-contracted providers/practitioners. All contractproviders/practitioners must participate in CHAMPUS. Contract providers/practitionersagree to accept the FHC Choice contract rate as payment in full for theirservices. Noncontracted providers/practitioners who do not participatein CHAMPUS have the option to bill beneficiaries for the difference betweenthe FHC Choice contract rates (CHAMPUS allowable charge) and their billedcharges except Medicare participating institutions as noted above. (Forpurposes of this demonstration, the CHAMPUS allowable amount is the FHCChoice contract rate.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Case Management Overview </ITAG>The FHC Choice Case Management System is a clinically sensitive but realisticallyempathetic system designed to assure that CHAMPUS eligible beneficiariesreceive needed mental health services in a quality and cost effective manner.The system is designed to encourage the delivery of mental health servicesat the least intensive level consistent with effective treatment of thebeneficiary's problems. All CHAMPUS beneficiaries receiving mental healthservices in the demonstration project area fall within the purview of theFHC Choice Case Management Program. Inherent in the Case Management Systemare the following: (1) Minimal paperwork required from providers; (2) protectionof each beneficiary's freedom of choice as to selection of providers; (3)clinically focused intake process; (4) active on-site inpatient case management;(5) minimal outpatient case management; (6) assistance in helping the beneficiaryobtain appropriate referral. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case Management Intake Process </ITAG>An intake evaluation is generally required for any CHAMPUS beneficiarybefore receiving mental health services from a CHAMPUS authorized provider.The intake process assures that the client is eligible to receive CHAMPUSbenefits. The clinical evaluation offered by the intake counselors assessesthe client's treatment needs and directs the patient to the appropriatetreatment provider and appropriate level of care. The intake process isrequired for the following situations: (1) CHAMPUS beneficiaries seekingmental health services (either inpatient or outpatient) for the first time;(2) current outpatients who are in need of a change to more intense levelof care (pre-admission); (3) patients who have not received care from aparticular mental health provider for at least 90 days, whose authorizationfor services has expired, and who wish to return to that same providerfor care; (4) patients whose authorization has expired, who have been outof care, and are seeking services from a different practitioner. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Authorization for Care </ITAG>The intake/pre-admission process has three distinct parts: (1) Registrationand verification; (2) clinical evaluation; (3) recommendations and referral.If the intake clinical evaluation finds that the client is in need of mentalhealth services, the intake counselor will provide an initial authorizationfor either outpatient or inpatient services. (1) <T3>Outpatient Authorization. </T3>Clients referred from the intake centerto an outpatient treatment provider will receive an initial authorizationto seek care within 30 days. This will allow sufficient time for the clientto decide on a treatment provider and to obtain an initial appointment.(2) <T3>Inpatient Authorization. </T3>The initial authorization for inpatientservices will extend for 72 hours. The authorization will include clinicaland evaluative procedures to be conducted during this initial 72 hoursof authorized care. Where appropriate, the client will hand carry the initialauthorization and intake evaluation form from intake so that the providerwill have this information at time of first contact. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case Management Referral for Treatment </ITAG>The FHC Choice Case Management process is designed to assure the CHAMPUSclient's freedom of choice in obtaining appropriate care. At the same time,it is the intent to respect any patient/provider relationship that mayhave already been established. The referral recommendations will be basedupon the results of the clinical evaluation and the clinical needs of theclient. The intake assessment center staff will honor the client's choiceof treatment provider and will assist the client in obtaining an initialappointment. Criteria for making referrals are as follows: (1) Patientrequest; (2) FHC Choice contracted provider; (3) area of clinical specialty;(4) geographic location_accessibility and convenience for the patient;(5) reported quality of service_information obtained from follow-up contactwith the client; (6) availability. <ITAG tagnum="84">Outpatient Care </ITAG>When a patient comes to an outpatient provider's office for the initialsession, the client should have with him/her a copy of the initial authorization,as well as the initial evaluation form and a copy of an assessment protocol.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outpatient Case Management </ITAG>Outpatient treatment services will be minimally case managed by FHC Choice.FHC Choice views outpatient treatment, with its scope encompassing supportive,intensive, and programmatic services, as a cost efficient effort. There are three levels of review in the FHC Choice outpatient case managementsystem:(1) <T3>Level I Review. </T3>The first level of review is accomplished throughthe claims process. Claims for outpatient care submitted to FHC Choicefor payment will be reviewed for the following: (a) To establish that providersof mental health services are CHAMPUS authorized; (b) to ensure that thebeneficiary has participated in the clinical intake process; (c) to verifysponsor status; (d) to ensure that diagnosis and treatment procedures arein accordance with CHAMPUS regulations and policy. (See CHAMPUS policymanual 6010.47-M). Should claims records indicate that these limits areexceeded, then the case will be referred to Level II Review. (2) <T3>Level II Review. </T3>The reviews of outpatient cases at the secondlevel are conducted by FHC Choice Outpatient Case Managers, under the directionof the Director of Clinical Management. Level II reviews are initiatedin two ways: (a) When cases do not pass Level I Review (e.g., session frequencyis greater than two times per week for one beneficiary) or (b) after the24th outpatient session. Providers are to complete an FHC Choice OutpatientTreatment Report on a patient if outpatient care has reached the 24th session.This completed Outpatient Treatment Report must be submitted to OutpatientCase Management and serves as the basis of the Level II Review.The review is conducted by the outpatient case managers according to utilizationand quality assurance criteria. The results of this review will be forwardedto the treating provider, along with authorization for continued care anda blank Outpatient Treatment Review Form. If, for some reason, the casedoes not pass Level II review, and further information and documentationdoes not satisfy the Level II criteria, conditional sessions will thenbe authorized for the practitioner and patient to mutually discuss thesituation and decide on the course of action most beneficial to the patient.FHC Choice recognizes the variety of outpatient treatment practices inthe project area. Patients might be referred to a number of different providersfor ancillary services or treatment. It should be noted that the providerof record is considered the primary provider, and it is <T3>this</T3> provider that will be contacted at time of case review. Therefore,if any provider receives a CHAMPUS patient upon referral from another provider,it is imperative that the two practitioners communicate with each otheras to who will remain the primary provider. (3) <T3>Level III Medical Review.</T3> Level III Medical Review is initiatedwhen: (a) A case fails the criteria at Level II review, or (b) the 48thoutpatient session has been reached. Generally, this review will be conductedby a Peer Reviewer within the same discipline and area of expertise/specializationas the treating provider. At this review, there will be an evaluation ofthe medical or psychological necessity, appropriateness, effectiveness,and efficiency of outpatient services delivered by the CHAMPUS authorizedproviders. The Medical Reviewer will form observations and recommendationsbased upon the FHC Choice outpatient criteria, professional standards,and other norms and personal professional judgement. A written report insupport of the judgement will be forwarded to the provider along with ablank FHC Choice Outpatient Report and authorization. <ITAG tagnum="84">Limits to Outpatient Treatment </ITAG>The initial authorization for outpatient care will be valid for thirtydays. Once a beneficiary initiates outpatient treatment with a provider,the provider must contact the originating Intake Center in order to extendthe initial authorization, which will then become valid for twenty-foursessions or one year, whichever is less. Although CHAMPUS has no firm limitsto the extent of outpatient coverage, cases which continue beyond the 24thsession will be subjected to increasingly more intense review. The frequencyof outpatient care is limited to a maximum of two sessions in a 7 day period,unless more are justified as medically or psychologically necessary. OutpatientCase Management will follow CHAMPUS policy regarding criteria for allowablelimits on treatment services. Providers are referred to CHAMPUS PolicyManual 6010.47-M. <ITAG tagnum="84">Inpatient Care</ITAG>Inpatient care includes acute hospitalization, partial hospitalization,and residential treatment. Inpatient care is covered for both psychiatricand chemical dependency services. (1) <T3>Non-Emergency Admissions.</T3> All non-emergency admissions to inpatientcare must be preauthorized. Patients must go through registration and preadmissionscreening at one of the FHC Choice Intake Centers. If a CHAMPUS beneficiarywho has <T3>not</T3> been preauthorized for inpatient care presents at a facilityrequesting admission, then the facility must send this beneficiary to thenearest Intake Center before proceeding further. If a CHAMPUS beneficiarypresents at a facility for admission <T3>with</T3> a valid preauthorization, the facility can admit the patientfor care. However, the facility's admissions office must notify FHC CaseManagement by telephone within two hours during normal working hours, Mondaythrough Friday, of all such preauthorized admissions. (2) <T3>Emergency Admissions.</T3> In emergency situations, the safety andwelfare of the patient takes precedent over administrative procedures.CHAMPUS policy defines a psychiatric emergency as a situation where a truelife-threatening situation exists. The patient must be experiencing significantdistress and dysfunction and present a real and significant risk to himselfor to others. A suicide threat by itself does not constitute significantrisk. However, if the patient is threatening suicide and has both the intentand means of which to carry out the threat if not put under immediate care,then the situation does meet with FHC Choice criteria for emergency/crisisadmission. <ITAG tagnum="84">Inpatient Case Management </ITAG>Inpatient case management is conducted on-site by FHC Choice InpatientCase Managers, who review the medical record documentation and discussthe case and the patient's care with the treatment team and treating providers.The patient's condition, progress in treatment, and treatment plan areevaluated by the Case Manager according to FHC Choice Case Management Criteria.In reviewing a case for continued treatment, the Case Manager will completea Continued Treatment Review Form which will detail the data consideredas part of the treatment review. This form will also indicate the outcomeof the case review, with the Case Manager's decision regarding authorizationfor further stay and clinical procedures. This form will be placed on thepatient's medical record. Direct consultation and discussion is encouraged between the InpatientCase Manager and treatment providers. This direct communication needs tooccur not only at the times of scheduled case reviews, but also throughoutthe inpatient treatment process. Communication is particularly importantwhen problems are encountered in treatment, or when changes in patientstatus require any modifications in the treatment plan, such as changein level of care or discharge. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuing Stay Authorizations </ITAG>At each continuing stay review, Case Managers will authorize both additionalhospital days at a particular level of care, as well as a treatment planof clinical procedures. Typical authorization limits granted by Case Managersare as follows: (1) Initial acute psychiatric authorization (3 days); (2)initial detoxification authorization (3 days); (3) acute adult psychiatric(7 days per review); (4) acute child/adolescent psychiatric (10 days perreview); (5) chemical dependency inpatient rehabilitation (10 days perreview); (6) adult partial hospitalization psychiatric and chemical dependency(10 days per review); (7) child/adolescent partial hospitalization psychiatricand chemical dependency (15 days per review); (8) child/adolescent residentialpsychiatric (21 days per review). These limits represent the maximum numberof days a Case Manager can authorize at each review for a particular levelof care and treatment program. Case Managers can authorize a fewer numberof days each time and thus review a case more frequently.Inpatient Case Managers will authorize clinical procedures based on theclinical needs of the patient and the provider-generated treatment plan.CHAMPUS and FHC Choice policy sets limits on the number of professionalservices delivered to patients depending on the level of care and program.These limits are expressed in terms of ``therapy hour equivalents''. Forcase management and treatment planning purposes, the following servicesare all ``therapy hour equivalents''. Variations in individual treatmentplans and patient needs can be discussed with the Case Manager: (1) Onehour (50 minutes) individual psychotherapy session (CPT 90844); (2) onehour (50 minutes) family psychotherapy session (CPT 90812); (3) two halfhour (25-30 minutes) individual psychotherapy sessions (CPT 90843); (4)two medical/psychiatric management sessions (CPT 90862). Acute Psychiatric Hospital Programs. Professional services for patientsin acute inpatient psychiatric programs are limited to five therapy hourequivalents provided in a seven day period. Treatment plans and specificpatient needs must be discussed with the Case Manager for authorizationpurposes. Full-Day Partial Hospitalization Psychiatric Programs. Therapy hour equivalentsare limited to four in a seven day period for full day partial hospitalpsychiatric patients. Half-day Partial Hospital Psychiatric Programs. Therapy hour equivalentsare limited to three in a seven day period for half-day partial hospitalpsychiatric patients. Residential Psychiatric Programs. The reimbursable rate for residentialcare is all-inclusive of clinical services. Therefore, professional clinicalprocedures will not be authorized separately from the authorization ofdays of care. Chemical Detoxification Programs. Chemical detoxification is seen as amedically-intensive treatment program. One medical management procedureper day will be authorized. Since the clinical status of detoxificationpatients contraindicates psychotherapeutic interventions, individual, familyand group psychotherapies will typically not be authorized during thisphase of treatment. Inpatient Chemical Dependency Rehabilitation Programs. The reimbursablerate for inpatient chemical dependency rehabilitation programs is to includecomprehensive substance abuse intervention strategies. However, in thecases of certain dual-diagnosed patients who are in chemical dependencyrehabilitation programs, the Case Manager can authorize up to two therapyhour equivalents of clinical services for a seven day period. These patientsmust have been evaluated by a psychiatrist who renders the DSM III-R psychiatricdiagnosis and recommends psychotherapeutic intervention. Care in excessof this limit may be approved upon receipt of significant documentationfrom the treating provider to justify an exception based on an assessmentof the patient's condition. Full-Day and Half-Day Partial Hospitalization Chemical Dependency Programs.Therapy hour equivalents are limited to two in a seven day period for allchemical dependency partial hospitalization patients. <ITAG tagnum="84">Psychological Testing</ITAG>In order to maximize the contribution of psychological assessment to thetreatment plan, FHC Choice encourages the use of a two stage approach topsychological testing. The first stage encompasses the use of self-administered,objective inventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory(MMPI) or Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI), or other assessmentprotocols, as a screening evaluation. The screening procedures will countas one unit (25-30 minutes) of testing. In many cases, the utilizationof such brief, cost effective testing can clarify diagnostic issues andprovide information useful in treatment planning. If the results of theinitial screening suggest the need for further full-scale psychologicalevaluation, then such testing can be requested and will need preauthorization.CHAMPUS policy (6010.47-M) limits reimbursement for psychological testingto four hours (8 units) per beneficiary in a twelve month period (exceptfor a neuropsychological battery). FHC Choice will consider the screeningtests to count towards this CHAMPUS limit, so that the limit of additionalauthorization for psychological testing will be 7 units (3.5 hours).(1) <T3>Psychological Screening. </T3>Preauthorization for psychological screeningwill be automatic at the time of intake. For inpatients, this preauthorizationwill be valid for seventy-two hours. For outpatients, the screening, ifutilized, will be considered a procedure counting toward the twenty-foursessions for second level review. Only one psychological screening procedurewill be allowed in a twelve month period. Self-administered, objectiveinventories such as the MMPI, MCMI, or Hilson Adolescent Profile will bereimbursed as psychological screening. For children, the Personality Inventoryfor Children or similar parent-report inventory, will be considered a psychologicalscreening instrument.(2) <T3>Additional Inpatient Testing. </T3>If the screening assessment of aninpatient suggests the need for further testing, the provider can obtainpreauthorization for up to seven units (3.5 hours) of testing (if the patienthas not received previous testing, except for screening, in the past twelvemonths) from the Inpatient Case Manager. If more than seven units are beingrequested, or if the patient has been tested within the past twelve months,then a Request for Psychological Testing form needs to be completed bythe Provider and sent to Case Management, Clinical Services Division, FHCChoice to obtain preauthorization for testing. Testing should not be administereduntil preauthorization is obtained.(3) <T3>Additional Outpatient Testing. </T3>Preauthorization for psychologicaltesting beyond the screening assessment for an outpatient needs to be requestedby the provider by completing a Request for Psychological Testing Formand forwarding this form to Case Management, Clinical Services Division,FHC Choice. Testing should not be administered until preauthorization isobtained, since the services might not be reimbursed without this preauthorization.If the need for testing is urgent, then the provider can telephone OutpatientCase Management to obtain a verbal preauthorization. Outpatient psychologicaltesting is counted as a procedure contributing toward the twenty-four sessionsfor the second level review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Medical Records Documentation Requirements</ITAG>Inpatient and outpatient records must fully support the Case Managementand treatment plan documentation guidelines, be of sufficient detail tomeet the documentation standards of FHC Choice, and provide protocols fortimely initial and subsequent placement, level of care, and discharge determinationand support planning. Inpatient medical records must comply with standards for psychiatric facilitiesin the JCAH <T3>Consolidated Standards Manual/87 </T3>for Child, Adolescent, and AdultPsychiatric, Alcoholism, and Drug Abuse Facilities or the then currentmanual and CHAMPUS Policy Manual, Vol Two, Chapter 4, Section I. Medicalrecords for outpatient care must contain, at a minimum, treatment plans,progress notes for each treatment encounter, and completion of treatmentnotes. All care rendered and billed must be documented within three (3)working days of patient encounter. Since inpatient case management relies heavily upon a review of the documentationin the medical record, current and complete documentation of treatmentefforts is imperative. Inpatient Case Management will expect the followingdocumentation guidelines to be followed: (1) Psychiatric admission evaluation(within 24 hours of admission); (2) history and physical exam (within 24hours of admission); (3) nursing assessment (within 24 hours of admission);(4) family assessment (within 72 hours of admission); (5) master treatmentplan (within 72 hours of admission for acute care, within 7 days of admissionfor partial and residential); (6) physician notes for intensive treatment,detoxification, and rapid stabilization programs (daily); acute programs(twice per week); partial programs (once per week); residential programs(once per week); (7) nursing notes required for acute psychiatric and detoxificationprograms (per shift); partial/residential programs (per shift); (8) individualand family therapy (within 8 hours of procedure); (9) group therapy (onceper week); (10) ancillary services (weekly).In order to maximize the cost effectiveness of acute care, FHC Choice willexpect the treatment plan to reflect the provision of treatment serviceson weekends as well as weekdays. For all levels of inpatient care, familyinvolvement in the patient's treatment through collateral contacts or familytherapy will be required. The clinically justified use of therapeutic passeswill be allowed. FHC Choice Case Management guidelines require providers to inform CaseManagement when certain critical events occur in a patient's course ofhospital treatment: (1) Preauthorized admissions (within 2 hours duringnormal working hours, Monday through Friday, notify Case Management); (2)emergency admissions (within 2 hours of admission, notify Case Management(during working hours Monday through Friday) or Intake (after hours orweekends)); (3) planned changes in level of care (at least 24 hours priorto transfer, contact Case Manager); (4) unplanned changes in level of care(within 2 hours, notify Case Management (during working hours Monday throughFriday) or Intake (after hours or weekends)); (5) planned discharges (atleast 24 hours prior to discharge, contact Case Manager); (6) against medicaladvice (AMA) discharges (within 4 hours, notify Case Management (duringworking hours Monday through Friday) or Intake (after hours or weekends)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Transition Care and Case Management </ITAG>The incoming contractor will be informed of those current cases which willlikely be continued in care after April 1. FHC Choice will contact allCHAMPUS authorized providers during the month of March to request informationabout CHAMPUS beneficiaries and other case loads in order to cross referenceinformation received from the outgoing contractor. FHC Choice will begin reviewing inpatient cases during the latter partof March using FHC Choice Case Management criteria. Authorizations willbe written to be effective April 1. For those cases where it is doubtfulthat authorizations will be extended beyond April 1, patients will be interviewedto explain the reasons for this and to inform them of the implicationsof this decision. The patient and provider will be notified of the decisionwithin one working day of the interview. Beneficiaries currently in outpatient care will not have to go throughthe intake process. Patients whose authorization through First Step CaseManagement expires March 31 will be given new authorization under FHC Choice.Level II Case Management review by outpatient Case Managers will be initiatedby claims submission after April 1. During April, cases with a treatmenthistory of sixty sessions or more will go to Level II review. During Mayand June, the treatment length criteria for Level II review will be 48and 36 sessions, respectively. By July, the review interval will be 24sessions, where it will remain under the continuing Case Management.system.<ITAG tagnum="84">Non-Availability Statements (NAS) </ITAG>All beneficiaries receiving non emergency inpatient mental health servicesare required to have a NAS on record for the episode of care. A requestfor a NAS will be initiated by the beneficiary or FHC Choice Case ManagementServices prior to or within twenty-four (24) hours after a CHAMPUS-eligiblebeneficiary is admitted for acute inpatient psychiatric care. This willoccur whether care is authorized or not. A NAS Worksheet, a Request forCHAMPUS Coverage Form, and a copy of the patient's Military ID Card willbe forwarded to the Eligibility Department at FHC Choice, 240 CorporateBlvd., Norfolk, VA 23502. If it determined that a NAS is required, theappropriate information will be forwarded to Portsmouth Naval Hospitalso that a NAS can be generated. The Eligibility Coordinator of FHC Choicewill send copies of the completed NAS to the patient and providers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Failure to Comply With Case Management </ITAG>Any current CHAMPUS-authorized institutional provider must, for purposesof this demonstration, agree to comply with the FHC Choice Case ManagementSystem. Such required compliance means that the status as a CHAMPUS-authorizedprovider will be lost if the provider fails to comply with FHC-Choice'sCase Management System at least 95% of the time within any 30 day period.FHC Choice Case Management System requires the submission by institutionalproviders and individual practitioners of all documents required by theCase Management System to support the medical necessity of care deliveredunder the system <T3>before </T3>reimbursement is made. If a non-contracted practitionerprovides care to a CHAMPUS beneficiary before receiving preauthorization,claims for those services will be denied until the required documentationand a copy of the clinical record of such care has been submitted. FHCChoice will determine, retrospectively, based on the documentation submitted,whether the care was medically and psychologically necessary, was deliveredas the same level of care that would have been preauthorized under CaseManagement, and was of the duration that would have been preauthorizedat that level under Case Management. FHC Choice will pay for the care thatwas delivered only to the extent that the care would have been preauthorizedat the appropriate level, and will deny reimbursement for all other caredelivered. For those non-contracted providers whose patients have beenthrough Intake, all late or missing documentation (treatment plan, admissionnotes, progress notes, etc.) must be submitted for FHC Choice case managementconsideration prior to consideration for payment of the services rendered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Documentation and Submission Requirements for Inpatient Care </ITAG>The following documentation is required for inpatient care: (1) A releaseof information form signed by the beneficiary indicating that the beneficiaryis at financial risk by not going through intake and prospective case management.(2) An initial treatment report or equivalent providing initial diagnosis,formulation of risk factors, precipitating factors requiring hospitalization,treatment plan with short term (five days) and long term (to dischargefrom treatment) objectives, criteria for discharge and appropriate timetablefor attaining objectives, and discharge date. (3) A discharge plan providingdiagnosis, progress, how all goals were met, factors contributing to nextlevel of care, treatment plan for next level of care, and criteria fordischarge from next level of care. (4) Copy of complete clinical recordpertaining to patient. <ITAG tagnum="84">Documentation and Submission Requirements for Outpatient Care </ITAG>The following documentation is required for outpatient care: (1) A releaseof information from the patient as described above for inpatient. (2) Atreatment report, dated, signed, and including diagnosis, risk factorsand causation, precipitating factors requiring treatment, appropriate treatmentplan, long and short term goals, criteria for discharge, and anticipateddischarge date. (3) Copy of clinical progress notes with date of each treatmentencounter, description of service, progress towards meeting objectives,any change in diagnosis, results from testing, change in treatment plans,changes in discharge criteria, justification for changes in level of carewhen indicated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case Management and Non-Compliance </ITAG>All current CHAMPUS authorized institutional providers in the demonstrationproject area must comply with the FHC Choice Case Management system. Non-contractedinstitutional providers must attain at least a ninety-five percent rateof compliance within any 30 day time period. This level of compliance mustbe achieved in order for a facility to retain their status as a CHAMPUSauthorized provider. Failure to comply will result in the loss of CHAMPUSauthorized status for a period of twelve (12) months. The following CaseManagement requirements are considered critical for issues of compliance:(1) Patients must participate in the Intake/Preauthorization process; (2)patients admitted into inpatient care must be preauthorized for such care(except for emergency admissions); (3) institutional providers must notifyFHC Choice Case Management/Intake of any admission within two hours; (4)institutional providers must provide Case Managers access to clinical recordsand treatment staff for case review purposes; (5) documentation guidelinesmust be followed so Case Management reviews can be conducted as needed;(6) FHC Choice Case Management must be notified of any changes in levelof care and discharges within guideline limits. In calculating the rates of compliance, the number of CHAMPUS admissionswill be used as a base. Incidents of noncompliance will not be additivefor individual patients. Thus, as way of example, assume that a facilityadmits twenty CHAMPUS patients in a 30 day period. If one of these patientswas not preauthorized because at the time of admission he was consideredan emergency, but this was not substantiated upon retrospective review,then this situation represents one incident of non-compliance. The compliancerate for the facility would be ninety-five percent. Additional incidentsof non-compliance with this same patient would not change the rate of compliance.However, if during this same time period, the facility admits a secondpreauthorized patient, but fails to inform FHC Case Management of thisadmission within two hours, then this counts as another incident of non-complianceand the facility falls below the ninety-five percent compliance rate. FHCChoice will notify OCHAMPUS of the circumstance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Claims Submission Requirements </ITAG>All claims for care provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries must be submitted ona CHAMPUS approved claim form(s) and must contain the actual address, includingzip code, where the services were provided regardless of the providerspreferred billing address. <ITAG tagnum="84">Claims Submission Requirements for Contracted Providers </ITAG>FHC Choice contracted providers are required to submit claims for servicesno later than sixty (60) days from the last date of the month in whichthe services were delivered. In cases where CHAMPUS is the secondary payor,the contracted provider is required to submit claims for services no laterthan sixty (60) days from the last date of the month in which the serviceswere paid or denied by the previous payer. <ITAG tagnum="85">Claims Submission for Services That Were Not Subject to Case ManagementReview for Preauthorization and Delivered by a Noncontracted Provider </ITAG>All claims for services not subject to previous case management reviewfor inpatient, partial and residential treatment and outpatient servicesmust be submitted no later than ninety (90) days from the date of service.In cases where CHAMPUS is the secondary payor, the claims must be submittedno later than 180 days from the date of service. Claims received after90 days (or 180 days as noted) will be returned to the submitting partyunpaid. This filing deadline is only applicable to claims submitted forservices which have not initially been subject to case management reviewfor FHC Choice preauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="84">Claims for Services Delivered Prior to April 1, 1989 </ITAG>Claims for mental health care delivered prior to April 1, 1989 will beprocessed by Sentara First Step and should be sent to 22 Koger ExecutiveCenter, Suite 200, Norfolk, VA 23502. Claims for mental health servicesdelivered on or after April 1, 1989 will be processed by the contractorand should be sent to FHC Choice, 240 Corporate Blvd., Norfolk, VA 23502Attention: Claims Department. Claims for other CHAMPUS authorized healthcare services should be forwarded to CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA, Blue Cross/Blue Shieldof South Carolina, P.O. Box 10050, Florence, SC 29501-0502. <ITAG tagnum="84">Payment for Services by FHC Choice </ITAG>Payment for all covered mental health care delivered on and after Aprill, 1989, to beneficiaries who receive care in the demonstration area, whethersuch care is received from a contracted provider or a non-contracted provider,providers and beneficiaries, as appropriate, will receive payment by theContractor at the same rates that the Contractor pays its contracted providersand subject to the other limitations of this demonstration. These ratesare available, upon request, from FHC Choice. This means that if a contractedpsychiatrist has a contracted rate of $60 for a fifty minute outpatientvisit, the Contractor will pay, for an active duty family member, 80% ofthe $60, or $48, while the beneficiary will pay 20% of the $60, or $12.If a noncontracted psychiatrist has a rate of $80 for a fifty minute outpatientvisit, the beneficiary will receive 80% of $60 (the contracted psychiatristrate), or $48 from the Contractor, and the remaining $32 is the responsibilityof the beneficiary. It should be further noted that all mental health caredelivered as part of this demonstration is subject to the Contractor'scase management system, and that care provided by non-contracted providerswill only be reimbursed, under the case management system, when the careis deemed by the Contractor to be appropriate, delivered at the appropriatelevel, and medically or psychologically necessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Payment for Acute Hospitalization </ITAG>FHC Choice will reimburse a per diem for inpatient acute programs as specifiedin the fee schedule. However, reimbursement for professional services renderedto acute inpatients will be limited to five (5) therapy-hour equivalentsper seven (7) day period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Payment for Partial Hospitalization </ITAG>FHC Choice will pay a per diem to hospitals which provide full and half-daypartial programs. Providers of professional services to patients in theseprograms will be reimbursed at the partial hospitalization rates. However,FHC Choice will limit reimbursement for professional services deliveredto patients in partial programs as follows: (1) Full Day Partial: onlyfour (4) therapy-hour equivalents per week will be authorized for reimbursement;(2) Half-Day Partial: only three (3) therapy-hour equivalents per weekwill be authorized for reimbursement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Payment for Residential Treatment </ITAG>Reimbursement for residential treatment will be at the all-inclusive rateof $250.00 per day effective April 1, 1989. Providers of professional servicesrendered to residents will not be reimbursed above the $250.00 per diem.Professionals practicing at RTCs may be employees of the RTC or contractedby the facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Psychotropic Drugs and Their Administration </ITAG>Reimbursement for inpatient psychotropic drugs and their administrationis included in the FHC Choice fee schedule rate used to reimburse facilities.Injectable psychotropic drugs administered by a physician in his/her professionaloffice are reimbursed for the cost of the drug and its administration byFHC Choice. Prescriptions for psychotropic drugs are not reimbursable byFHC Choice, but may be submitted to the fiscal intermediary for the Mid-Atlanticregion. <ITAG tagnum="84">Nonmental Health Medical Services </ITAG>Nonmental health medical services (for example, surgery, radiology or laboratoryservices) not related to the mental health diagnosis rendered during thecourse of a mental health treatment, and for which a separate charge ismade, will be separately billed by the provider on a CHAMPUS claim formfor benefit and reimbursement determination by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaryfor the Mid-Atlantic Region. Nonmental health services include diagnosticservices required to rule out medical bases for mental health diagnoses,except for that testing which is required by the contractor's quality assurancescreens for differential diagnosis, which will be paid for by the contractor.For Inpatient Services, if a beneficiary receives care for a medical diagnosisand a mental health diagnosis, and the medical diagnosis is primary andreimbursable under CHAMPUS, the contractor shall forward such claims tothe fiscal intermediary for the Mid-Atlantic Region for processing. Ifthe beneficiary receives care for a medical diagnosis and a mental healthdiagnosis and the medical diagnosis is not the primary diagnosis, the facilitywill be reimbursed according to the contractor's published fee schedule.The contractor shall be responsible for hospital room and board charges,based on the primary diagnosis. Within five (5) working days of identification,the contractor shall forward to the fiscal intermediary a copy of the claim,along with information on any reimbursements made for mental health services;the fiscal intermediary will adjudicate the claim for nonmental healthcare on the basis of the line items appropriate to the medical servicesprovided, to include those rendered by hospital based physicians. <ITAG tagnum="84">History and Physicals </ITAG>When the initial history and physical is performed and billed for a psychiatricadmission in the CPA demonstration, the physician providing the servicemay be reimbursed, whether or not he/she is the attending physician, bythe CPA contractor at the contracted established FHC Choice reimbursementrate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Beneficiary Liability for Care </ITAG>a. Contracted Providers_If beneficiaries receive services from a contractedprovider, they are at financial risk for: (1) Required co-payment and deductible;and (2) noncovered care, or care not preauthorized for which the practitionerhas provided the beneficiary with written advance notice concerning thebeneficiary's financial liability; (3) failure to cooperate (see c. below).b. Noncontracted Providers_If beneficiaries receive services from a non-contractedprovider, they are at financial risk for: (1) co-payment and deductible;(2) balance billing for practitioners who do not accept assignment, exceptfor Medicare participating hospitals; (3) cost of care denied by FHC Choice,as upheld by the appeals process for lack of medical/psychological necessityor lack of FHC Choice's approval of the appropriate level of care; (4)any noncovered care (services which are not CHAMPUS covered benefits);and (5) any care provided which has not been documented for case management.c. Failure to cooperate_Contracted providers can bill beneficiaries forcare denied by FHC Choice if the basis of that denial is that the beneficiaryrefused to comply with FHC Choice's case management procedures or requirements.Practitioners who bill beneficiaries under these circumstances should haveappropriate documentation to demonstrate that the beneficiary refused tocomply with FHC Choice's case management system. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preferred Choice Plan and Cost Share Adjustments </ITAG>CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries will be offered the opportunity to takeadvantage of cost-share savings by pre-enrollment in the FHC Choice PreferredChoice plan. The cost share savings for the beneficiary will be realizedwhen they receive mental health and substance abuse services from FHC Choicecontracted practitioner and institutional providers. All CHAMPUS eligiblebeneficiaries will be afforded the opportunity to enroll in Preferred Choiceat any time at no cost to them. Enrollment can occur at the time of intake,direct admission to inpatient services, preadmission screening, walk-inat FHC Choice intake or administrative offices and by submission of anapplication by mail. Beneficiaries enrolled in the Preferred Choice Planwill retain their freedom of choice to obtain services from any CHAMPUS-approvedprovider for any mental health service. However, should a beneficiary chooseto obtain service from a contracted practitioner or institutional providerand is enrolled in the Preferred Choice Plan, that beneficiary will havethe benefit of cost-share savings. The cost share adjustments are as follows:Outpatient_deductibles are waived. The usual CHAMPUS co-payment schedulesare applied to all outpatient practitioner services. Inpatient_no institutionalper diem copayments are applied for Active Duty dependents. No twenty-fivepercent (25%) institutional copayment is applied for Retired dependents.The usual twenty-five percent (25%) copayment on practitioner charges forRetired dependents is reduced to fifteen (15%). <ITAG tagnum="84">Partial Hospitalization Cost Share Calculations </ITAG>Cost shares for partial hospitalization services are calculated as if theservices were for inpatient care. Under all other circumstances, the rulesof cost-sharing for mental health services provided in the demonstrationremain the same as under the existing CHAMPUS program. <ITAG tagnum="85">Requirements for Administrative Review of the Denial of Claims forServices Which Did Not Undergo Case Management </ITAG>(1) The claim must be received no later than 90 days after the date ofservice (or within 180 days of the date of service when there is evidenceof other health insurance). (2) The claim must have been denied, and theremust be an amount in dispute, as evidenced by the CHAMPUS Explanation ofBenefits (CEOB). (3) The reconsideration request must be received in writingfrom a proper appealing party within 60 days of the date of the CEOB. (4)For those non-contracted providers who did not comply with the Case ManagementSystem and obtain preauthorization prior to the delivery of services, allrequired documentation must be present before the reconsideration decisionis issued in order to be offered further appeal rights.Should the payment for services be denied due to failure to undergo casemanagement, it is the responsibility of the appealing party to submit thedocumentation required to establish entitlement to payment for servicesrendered. The documentation may be submitted at any time between the timeservices are rendered and the reconsideration is issued. FHC Choice willnot develop the file for missing documentation when the case did not undergocase management, and failure to submit all required documentation beforethe reconsideration decision is issued will result in a reconsiderationdecision that will support the denial of payment for those services, regardlessof medical necessity, with no further appeal rights offered. Once it has been determined that the file is complete, and all documentation(as listed previously) is present, the care will be retrospectively reviewedfor medical and psychological necessity, appropriate level of care andthe duration that would have been preauthorized by Case Management hadthe care been preauthorized. If the reconsideration determination findsthat all documentation has been submitted, but the care was not deemedto be medically or psychologically necessary or delivered at the appropriatelevel, further appeal rights will be offered. <ITAG tagnum="84">Beneficiary and Provider Rights of Appeal</ITAG>The rights of appeal remain essentially the same under this contract asthey are under the CHAMPUS program. Since the noncontracted provider issubject to the same case management system as the contracted providers,the contractor is required to review all cases. If the contractor determinesthat the care given by a contracted or non-contracted provider was eitherinappropriate or medically unnecessary, the contractor may deny reimbursementto the provider for such care. In such cases the provider may appeal thedecision of the contractor as outlined in the CHAMPUS Regulation, DoD 6010.8-R,Chapter 10 (32 CFR 199.l0). The beneficiary may also appeal if the careis provided by a noncontracted provider. If care was delivered by a noncontracted provider, and the appeal is sustained,the beneficiary is responsible for all charges for care determined to beeither inappropriate or medically unnecessary. If the care was deliveredby a contracted provider, and the appeal is sustained, the beneficiarybears no additional financial risk other than that governed by cost sharedeterminations. However, the beneficiary is, under any circumstance, freeto enter into a voluntary agreement with a contracted or a noncontractedprovider for non-covered mental health services with the clear understandingthat the beneficiary is responsible for 100% of all cost incurred in suchan agreement. In such cases, the beneficiary is a proper appealing partyregardless of whether the care was provided by a contracted or noncontractedprovider.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Appeal Reconsiderations</ITAG>The reconsideration determination is final if one or more of the followingexist: (1) The amount in dispute is less than $50. (2) The reconsiderationdecision finds that a contracted provider had not submitted the documentationnecessary to render a decision as to the medical or psychological necessityof the care within the time limits established by the Case Management Systemat the time the services were rendered. (3) The Reconsideration decisionfinds that a non-contracted provider did not comply with case managementprocedures, or, as an alternative, did not comply with the requirementsspecified above. (4) Appeal rights were offered, but a request for formalreview is not received by OCHAMPUS within 60 days of the date of the Reconsiderationdetermination.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">L.M.
