WHEN THE RUSSIANS ORBITED their first Sputniks in late 1957, a fascinated world tuned in to the radio signals the satellites beamed back, and the U.S. went into shock. The world's technological champion had been asleep at the switch.    The first catch-up try was a fresh disaster. The Navy had been readying for a grapefruit-sized satellite called Vanguard, and this was rushed to Florida for a quick blast-off in December 1957. The rocket blew up on the launching pad.    The U.S. did get into the space race with Explorer 1 a month after the Vanguard fiasco. It was launched by a Jupiter rocket from the Army's Redstone arsenal, developed by Werner Von Braun, one of the German scientists brought to the U.S. after World War II.    Explorer 1 went into Earth orbit Jan. 31, 1958, and stayed aloft for more than two years. During that time, it enabled U.S. scientists to discover and chart the Van Allen belt of magnetic radiation.    The huge lifting power of Soviet military rockets kept widening the Russian lead. In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space in Vostok 1. The U.S. had to be content with suborbital manned flights until February 1962, when John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. That same year, ATandamp;T launched Telstar 1, the first commercial communications satellite.    John F. Kennedy gave the U.S. a goal in space with his 10-year, $10 billion plan to put a man on the moon, climaxed in 1969 when Neal Armstrong first walked there. A year later, the Soviet Union brought back moon samples with its Luna 16 and sent its Luna 17 robot rover to explore the moon's surface. But the laurels in the &quot;race to space&quot; went to the U.S. That ended the public relations phase of space exploration. From then on the goals would be scientific, military -- and commercial. </TEXT></DOC>
