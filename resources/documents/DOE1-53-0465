The 217 petroleum exploration wells consultedallowed 1415 temperature values, such as Bottom Hole Temperature andDrill Stem Test, to be gathered. A statistical method is used to processthese temperature indications and gives a geothermal gradient rangingfrom 21 to 49/sup 0/C/km. The advantages and disadvantages of this methodare discussed. The resulting map shows that the general trend of thegeothermal gradient curves reflects the main structural directions ofthe country. The most important oil fields in central Tunisia are locatedwithin the zone of the geothermal gradient ranging between 35 and 45/sup0/C/km.</TEXT></DOC>
