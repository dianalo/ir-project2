My brother-in-law andfriends helped me. Here I had 1,000 things to put through my head.''   Miss Beilina's first New York stop was a hotel. A woman offeredto be her amateur manager. ``She took us to lunch and was kind tous.''   The violinist's South American manager arranged an audition forICM Artists, after which that big management company took her onits roster. The amateur manager remained her personalrepresentative. ``She worked with me inside ICM. I didn't speakmuch English. I didn't understand many things.''   The New York Times' chief music critic, Harold Schoenberg, wroteof her January 1978 New York debut: ``Her playing leans more to the(Joseph) Szigeti kind of musical approach. Her playing is noble andeven austere; and she has more control over bow and finger thanSzigeti ever did.''   The critic concluded his notice with a prediction, ``A violinistof Miss Beilina's formidable powers will not be an unknown forlong. We will be encountering her many times in the future _ on theconcert stage and with orchestra. Russia's loss is our gain.''   It hasn't happened.   ``I had only five concerts for the next year,'' she says. ``NowI know that it takes at least two years to build up. In Russia,they could book you for the next day.''   The woman who befriended her told Miss Beilina that ICM'sviolinists, including Isaac Stern, all had Israel connections.``She said I wouldn't be in a good position because I didn'temigrate to Israel.'' Taking the woman's advice, she left ICM andwent to another agency. Now she considers it her biggest mistake.   That agency, owned by Europeans, booked her in Europe and SouthAfrica. ``I had to go to South Africa, for the money. I never hadto be a waitress. I never ask anybody to give me money. I'm notmaterialistic. I can live with little money.   ``But I didn't have any feeling that everything will be allright.''   Her playing suffered. ``I got more and more upset. It doesn'tmean I go very low. I found it very difficult to really be on top.''   A ``comeback'' concert in 1984 was described in The New YorkTimes as coming ``after a period of what might be calledprofessional instability'' and continued, ``She should never havehad to come back; hers is the kind of solid violinistic talent thatought to be heard on a regular basis.''   Mstislov Rostropovich recommended that another agency take her.In three years it got her only five concerts. ``I was living onre-engagements, Italy, Germany, South America, South Africa,Miami,'' she says. One of her first American engagements wasplaying Beethoven in Miami. ``Places where I played once, I gotre-engagements one year after another.'' Last fall, she switched tomanager Norman Gladney.   In March, between performances in Germany and for the first timein 12 years, Miss Beilina visited her native country. She playedmusic one evening in a former church, now a recital hall. ``Withoutany publicity, it was full. I felt many people remember me and loveme, so that was very emotional also.''   Raising Mickey alone wasn't always easy or smooth but now motherand son are friends and colleagues. ``He was too fresh in school,''she says. ``He was expelled from one school. Now I feel I'm awinner because he is in Yale.   ``This is the first year I could do my work without having tocook for him every day. Before, I was not able to play chambermusic enough. This year is productive and different. I begin toplay everything possible _ quartets and with piano.''   The two Bach festivals in churches here didn't pay, but the onein Italy does.   One thing is leading to another and Miss Beilina feels, at last,that her career is on the rise.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 13</NOTE></DOC>
