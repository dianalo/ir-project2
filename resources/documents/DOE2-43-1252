Theneed for such studies is emphasized via some interesting results whichshow an excessive dependence of effective passivation on the processconditions such as processing time, substrate temperature, gas pressureand RF power which seems to have been overlooked by earlier workers.Our results reveal that there is an optimum for almost all the aboveparameters which yield the most effective passivation of the grain boundariesin polycrystalline silicon. Physically, therefore, it implies that optimumhydrogen incorporation in a particular bonding configuration is a necessarycondition to achieve best passivation. Results of samples passivatedfor several hours indicate the presence of yet another process alongwith the normal hydrogen diffusion. Possibilities of bond breaking orhydrogen incorporation in different bonding configurations cannot becompletely ruled out. The dependence of effective passivation on theseprocess conditions is also revealed by the systematic studies of variationin average carrier concentration, charge carrier mobility and resistivitywith substrate temperature, RF power and gas pressure. Polycrystallinesilicon solar cells passivated with the optimum process conditions showsignificant improvement in the efficiency and fill factor. Presence ofhydrogen was confirmed by quadrupole mass spectrometry studies by heatingthe passivated samples.</TEXT></DOC>
