Meggitt has made an all-share offer of 130 new Meggitt shares for every 100 USH shares. The offer values each USH share at 165 pence. There is also a partial cash alternative of #85 cash plus 65 new Meggitt shares for 100 USH shares, which values each USH share at 160 pence.    &quot;The financial performance of USH has been lamentable and the management has been in disarray for five years,&quot; said Meggitt's Managing Director Ken Coates. &quot;Meggitt has the skills, experience and greater financial resources as well as the proven record to utilize USH's potential,&quot; he added. Mr. Coates said the acquisition would help Meggitt expand into new product areas. </TEXT></DOC>
