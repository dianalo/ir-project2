But the plaintiff in that case, R.H. Macy andamp; Co.,abruptly withdrew its suit after the proposition's supporters called for aboycott of the New York-based retailer's stores.;   Because it involvesresidential property, the newer case -- known as the Nordlinger case -- posesan even more fundamental threat to Proposition 13 than the Macy's dispute did.Most homeowners could expect substantially higher tax bills if the case provessuccessful.;   The case takes its name from Stephanie Nordlinger, a BaldwinHills homeowner who sued the Los Angeles County tax assessor on the groundsthat Proposition 13 discriminates against recent property owners in favor oflongtime owners. According to the suit, newer owners pay up to 15 times moreproperty tax.;   That's because Proposition 13 limited increases in theassessed value of property to 2 percent per year -- unless the property issold, in which case it can be reassessed at market value.;   No other stateassesses property in this way.;   Wildly popular when it passed in 1978,Proposition 13 sparked a tax revolt around the country. But in recent years,many Californians have come to regard its strictures as less than sacrosanct.Even co-author Paul Gann, before he died in 1989, expressed a wish to remedythe disparities between new homeowners and longtime homeowners.;   In June, astate Senate commission recommended a major overhaul of Proposition 13 thatwould return California to a market-based assessment system, but cushion theblow for homeowners by phasing in tax increases over time.;   Anti-tax groupscharge that this recommendation robs the post-Proposition 13 tax system of itsmost important element: predictability. Under Proposition 13, homeowners neednot worry that skyrocketing land values will hike their tax bills and forcethem from their homes.;   A Sacramento legislative consultant has estimatedthat a return to market-value assessments would boost yearly property taxreceipts from $17 billion to $26 billion, an average increase of 53 percentper homeowner.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BERT ROBINSON AND KRISTIN HUCKSHORN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911007  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  405  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 7, 199100281135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
