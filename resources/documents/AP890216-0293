Eastern claimed in response to union criticism that managementhas acted solely within the legal bounds of a federally imposed,30-day cooling-off period after the breakdown of 16 months ofcontract talks.   Eastern's allegations were contained in a five-page response _plus 50 pages of related documents _ delivered to U.S. DistrictJudge C. Clyde Atkins.   Atkins has ordered the airline to respond to the militant union'smotion for a temporary restraining order to block Eastern managementfrom hiring non-union workers to perform tasks traditionally handledby organized labor.   The Machinists union represents Eastern's 8,500 machinists,baggage handlers and ground personnel who have been working withouta contract for the past 13 months.   Atkins scheduled a hearing on the union request for late Fridaymorning.   The hearing will come at the end of a week that saw anoverwhelming 97.3 percent of Machinists members vote nationwide toauthorize a strike if no agreement is reached by midnight March 3 _the end of the cooling-off period.   The Miami-based airline will be free to impose its own work rulesand the union is free to strike legally at that time.   ``Eastern's response to the wildcat strike and ongoing slowdownhas been measured and consistent with its Railway Labor Actcontractual obligations,'' the airline's court documents said.   The wildcat walkouts ``were overt acts of economic warfare andtended to further the bargaining goals'' of the union, they said.   The airline charged that a work slowdown has grounded 17 of thecarrier's jetliners, which the document says amounts to ``almost 10percent of Eastern's scheduled fleet.'' A company attorney saidWednesday that 19 planes were grounded.   The airline said the planes were awaiting scheduled checks thatcould not be completed due to a work slowdown by Machinists.   Union leader Charles Bryant dismissed management's slowdowncharges Wednesday, recalling Eastern's recent performance _advertised as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry.   ``How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowingdown?'' he asked.   Another passage in Eastern's response appeared likely to evokegrim agreement from both sides in the dispute.   Eastern stated that the situation at the financially strappedairline ``promises to get much worse unless remedial action is takenpromptly.''   The airline said ``even the present backlog of grounded aircraftis totally unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company inEastern's dire financial condition.''   The airline is currently losing about $1 million a day and hassuffered losses estimated at $335.4 million for 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
