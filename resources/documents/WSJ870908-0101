Nobody is talking about another freefall in prices to below $10 a barrel, as happened last year. But the current price of about $19.30 a barrel on U.S. spot and futures markets probably will fall gradually, perhaps to about $16, some analysts say.    A supply disruption stemming from the conflict in the Persian Gulf would, of course, throw a wrench into any price decline. But analysts say the likelihood of this happening lessened Friday with the news that Iran had agreed to negotiate a United Nations peace plan to end the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq war.    This week's cartel committee meetings probably will have a major near-term influence on the oil market. But oil specialists say the effect of the rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran is likely to intensify later in the year, as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' full conference in December draws near.    Indeed, the vulnerabilities of the cartel could be &quot;somewhat exacerbated by the confrontation&quot; between Saudi Arabia and Iran, said James Schlesinger, senior adviser to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and former secretary of defense and of energy, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.    &quot;In the absence of harmony, they may find it harder to come together in a positive agreement&quot; at OPEC's next full ministerial meeting, Mr. Schlesinger said.    A period of relative Saudi-Iranian cooperation ended abruptly in July, when hundreds of Iranian pilgrims were killed in a clash with police in the Moslem holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.    Iran responded last week by vowing to overthrow the Saudi royal family and seize its oil wealth. The Saudis, in turn, have taken an uncharacteristically harsh line, denouncing Iran for its role in the riots.    Philip Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., said, &quot;It's going to make it much harder for OPEC to hold to their current agreement, let alone form a new one, which will drive down prices.&quot;    The rift &quot;will take away any confidence in the market about new cooperation within OPEC, and lead to an erosion of prices in the months ahead,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York. Mr. Donovan and some other analysts said prices could drop to as low as $16 a barrel later this year.    Still, some oil specialists say the Saudi-Iran strains aren't that significant. The two countries &quot;can be hostile as possible and still want to maintain OPEC's price structure,&quot; said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc., New York. Verbal warfare, he said, probably won't lead to economic warfare. &quot;It would be like shooting themselves in the foot.&quot;    Several oil analysts note that Saudi King Fahd has hooked his political prestige on sustaining an official $18-a-barrel oil price, making the chance of a large price decline less likely.    In any case, the fractiousness apparently ends a year of cooperation between the two sides and signals the end of an improving relationship that had developed steadily since before last October's ouster of Ahmed Zaki Yamani as Saudi oil minister, industry analysts say.    That relationship was particularly significant because of its effect on OPEC unity in the last year. OPEC's decision last December to cut production and return to fixed pricing, for instance, was cemented by Saudi-Iranian solidarity, which effectively forged an alliance between OPEC radicals and moderates. And June's OPEC conference was the shortest and most harmonious in years, primarily because of the compromise between the two on the cartel's output.    Any compromise now, however, would be unlikely, some specialists say. For one thing, the Saudis now are less inclined to agree to raise OPEC's official price in December to $20 a barrel from the current $18, a move that would be favored by Iran.    In addition, Saudi Arabia won't likely revert to its swing producer role by lowering its output to offset cheating by other OPEC members who are producing over their quotas, oil specialists say.    &quot;The Saudis aren't in the mood to be beat about the head with a club anymore,&quot; said Steve H. Hanke, chief economist for Friedberg Commodity Management Inc., Toronto. &quot;With the new tension, they won't be willing to shore the costs of propping prices.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
