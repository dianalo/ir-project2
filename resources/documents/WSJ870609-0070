Most of the area involved has already been leased. The ban, which has been in place since the early 1970s, affects offshore drilling rights held by several Calgary, Alberta-based companies, including Shell Canada Ltd., 79%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group; Chevron Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of Chevron Corp., San Francisco; and Petro-Canada, owned by the Canadian government.    In response, Chevron Canada said in a statement that it plans to conduct three years of geological and geophysical work, followed by the drilling of two exploration wells, after the ban is lifted.    Jack Davis, British Columbia's energy minister, told a news conference that he expects the ban will be lifted within about six months, and only in the northern section of the province's coastal waters. He said the exact date will be determined during negotiations between the province and the federal government regarding joint management of offshore exploration and development. For environmental reasons the offshore areas of southern British Columbia will remain closed to oil and gas exploration.    &quot;One of the world's great unexplored sedimentary basins lies off our west coast. If it lives up to its potential for petroleum production, it will bring major economic benefits to British Columbia and to Canada,&quot; he said.    Federal energy minister Marcel Masse told the news conference that Shell Canada drilled eight wells in waters north of Vancouver Island between 1966 and 1968, but the company didn't make any significant discoveries.    The drilling ban was imposed in response to widespread environmental concerns over the possibility of pollution. Despite continued opposition to drilling from fishermen, environmentalists and native Indians, a joint federal-provincial study recently recommended that the drilling ban be lifted. </TEXT></DOC>
