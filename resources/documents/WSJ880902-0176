Goodman Fielder, an Australian baking and diversified-foods conglomerate, last month saw its #1.7 billion ($2.85 billion) bid for Ranks Hovis referred to the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The move suggests the British government may be inclined to block the bid on antitrust grounds.    The referral, which leaves the Goodman Fielder bid in suspension until the commission finishes its review, was expected to be costly for Goodman Fielder. It borrowed heavily to finance the acquisition of the Ranks Hovis stake.    Goodman Fielder said it was &quot;in the best interest of its shareholders&quot; to dispose of its holding in Ranks Hovis because of &quot;the costs and delay involved in pursuing the {commission} reference.&quot;    The failure of the bid is a blow to Goodman Fielder's ambition to become a major force in the European foods industry. At the time of the referral, however, a spokesman for Samuel Montagu andamp; Co., Goodman Fielder's financial adviser, said the Australian company didn't regard Ranks Hovis as the only route into Europe.    Ranks Hovis share fell 21 pence (35 cents) to 387 pence ($6.50) in late trading yesterday on London's stock exchange. The stock had been trading above 450 pence before the bid was referred to the commission on Aug. 18. </TEXT></DOC>
