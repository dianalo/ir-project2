(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who was stripped of custody of herchild and convicted of prenatal child abuse for using cocaineduring pregnancy is a victim of the courts pushing the law tooutrageous limits, a lawyer said Tuesday.   But a law professor said the conviction Monday in Juvenile Courtwas likely to be endorsed by doctors because of compelling evidencethat pregnant women who use cocaine endanger their unborn babies.   Prosecutors said it apparently was the second case in Illinoisthis year in which a woman had been convicted of prenatal childabuse because of drug use.   Judge Frederick J. Kapala, who found the woman guilty ofprenatal abuse and neglect, said he was forced to ``take a stand''on the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed she had usedcocaine up to a few hours before the birth.   The child, in the care of social workers, shows no sign ofcocaine addiction or other serious cocaine-related health problems,officials said.   Paul Logli, Winnebago County state's attorney, said the womanfaces no jail time or fine because the case was tried only todetermine custody of the child.   The child, born three months ago, will remain in the care ofsocial workers pending the mother's treatment at a drugrehabilitation center. A hearing May 25 will determine if she isfit to regain custody of the child.   Neither the mother nor the child was identified.   J. Steven Beckett, an attorney in the state Bar Association'sindividual rights and responsibilities section, said the judge'sruling will ``allow headline-grabbing prosecutors anotheropportunity to practice their trade.''   ``If prenatal abuse happens with cocaine, it can happen withalcohol, it can happen with drunken driving, and it can happen withpregnant speeders,'' he said.   Kapala rejected the claim that his ruling could apply topregnant women who smoke or drink. The difference, he said, is thatcocaine is illegal.   Richard Epstein, professor at the University of Chicago Schoolof Law and a fellow at the university's Center for Clinical MedicalEthics, said that ``a lot of medical people will breathe a sigh ofrelief'' at Kapala's decision.   ``If you have an unborn child inside you, the evidence isoverwhelming that using cocaine is a form of abuse and neglect,''Epstein said.   Logli said he was considering filing criminal charges againstwomen whose babies die of cocaine addiction. ``We're talking abouta very dangerous illegal substance,'' he said. ``We have no choicebut to take serious steps to battle it.''   The prosecutor said that the infant's exposure to cocaine putsit at risk of kidney and developmental problems and increases therisk of sudden infant death syndrome.   A key element in the case involved the question of whetherIllinois law covers fetal rights.   The mother's attorney, Alberto F. Altamore, said the Illinoisjuvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors but does notaddress fetuses. State child abuse laws only speak of minors under21, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
