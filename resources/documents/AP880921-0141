Nationally, the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent fromlast year because of increased acreage and greater yields, due tobetter weather for flue-cured and some other kinds of tobacco. Dryweather kept burley yields below normal, but those still were upfrom last year's low levels.   ``Prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a smallincrease in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufacturedtobacco,'' the report said. ``U.S. tobacco use may increase from1987-88's 1.66 billion pounds because of greater use ofdomestically grown tobacco in U.S. cigarettes and higher cigaretteproduction.''   The report said U.S. cigarette output this year is expected toincrease from 689 billion ``pieces'' in 1987 because of risingexports.   However, cigarette consumption among Americans 18 years andolder is expected to continue a long-term decline, dropping around1{ percent this year from an average of 3,196 cigarettes in 1987,which was the lowest since World War II. Cigarette use peaked at4,345 pieces _ about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each _ in 1963.   The cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers andnon-smokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from yearto year.</TEXT></DOC>
