The last shipyard is closing, and the River Wear,once smothered in coal dust and bustling with boats, lies silent,waiting for landscapers to turn its banks into parkland.   The other side of this eerie, elegiac metaphor for a greening,post-industrial Britain lies just up the road, where a sprawling newshopping center has replaced the clang of hammers on steel with thechirp of busy cash registers.   Britain, once the Workshop of the World, is being transformedinto a nation of shopkeepers, tourist guides, bankers and high-techentrepreneurs, and nowhere is this more evident than in northeastEngland.   Seventy years ago, at the height of empire, British yards builtone-third of the world's tonnage, and gruff, grimy, noisy Sunderlandwas the Detroit of shipbuilding.   But like most Western ship industries, Britain's has shrunk withthe onset of Far East competition. Of 1,528 ships launched worldwidelast year, just 31 were British.   Now, with the government's announcement Dec. 8 that it is closingNorth East Shipbuilders Ltd., Sunderland's 600-year-old shipbuildingindustry has reached its end.   The 2,400 jobs lost will bump Sunderland's male unemploymentabove the 20-percent mark after a steady fall in the past two yearsfrom 23.6 percent to 19.1 percent.   ``I never imagined this could happen. I thought there'd always bea yard here,'' said Ernie Hunter, 56, a short, broad-shouldered manwho went to work as a ship's plumber at the age of 14.   But all over the northeast, in former citadels of heavy industrylike Newcastle, Sheffield and Sunderland, new life is sprouting amidthe rubble of the smokestack industries.   Coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles are being supplanted bycomputer manufacturing, Japanese auto plants, retailing, tourism _ anorthern counterbalance to the financial markets of London that haveblossomed under the free-market doctrines of Prime Minister MargaretThatcher.   The Bridges, Sunderland's glittering new indoor shopping center,is one example. Even more striking is the Metrocentre, a short trainride away, which claims to be Europe's largest combined shopping andleisure complex with three miles of shopping malls, 10,000 parkingspaces, and an indoor amusement park complete with roller coaster.   North East Shipbuilders' compensation package includes $80million to redevelop the docks and teach workers new skills. Thefuture of the new Britain depends on whether men in their 40s, whohave spent their lives in overalls welding, hammering, plumbing andriveting, can find new lives as shopkeepers, computer programmersand hotel keepers.   The response so far seems lukewarm.   ``It's closure on the cheap, a bloody insult to a skilledworkforce,'' said Alan Milburn, a researcher who is heading acampaign to save the shipyards.   Many of the men are hoping the campaign will succeed, and of adozen interviewed at random during the dying days of North EastShipbuilders, none appeared to have given any thought to acquiring anew skill.   Brian Brown, a welder, asked sardonically whether Sunderlandneeded 2,400 extra shopkeepers, while another welder, Kenny Downes,noted that the failure rate for new businesses is more than 50percent.   The closure came as no surprise.   ``We always knew that in shipbuilding there's boom times andslack times,'' said Brown, sitting amid the Christmas decorations inhis living room. ``But then it started to get less and less boom andmore and more slack and the writing was on the wall by the early'80s.''   Men like Brown stand to receive about $33,000 on average inseverance pay. His mortgage is paid off, his children almost grown,but that does not make life on the dole more attractive for avigorous 49-year-old man who was born and bred in Sunderland andwants to stay here.   The unions insist NESL's modern facilities can still turn aprofit. They point to studies predicting a global upturn inshipbuilding in the 1990s.   ``To write the United Kingdom as a maritime trading island nationout of the world shipbuilding market is industrially, economicallyand strategically crazy,'' said Milburn.   Most British shipyards were nationalized by Harold Wilson's Laborgovernment in 1977, and since Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives came tooffice in 1979, they have been steadily winding down the industry.With NESL's demise, the state will no longer own any shipyards.   Milburn accuses the government of being so ideologically obsessedwith denationalizing and winding down heavy industry that itdeliberately resisted outside offers to buy the yards.   But Industry Minister Tony Newton told Parliament none of theseoffers ``constituted a viable future,'' and ``I was not prepared topretend something provided a future when I didn't think it did. Thatwould have been the worst service I could have provided for thepeople of Sunderland.''   Sunderland, a city of 200,000, was never a garden spot. A19th-century travelers' handbook described it as ``enshrouded in theblackest gloom of smoke,'' while a French doctor wrote in 1831 of``a picture of wretchedness, filth and poverty.''   Shipbuilding, recorded in Sunderland as far back as 1346, was itslifeblood. Its ships kept Britain in touch with its empire and evenafterward, in the 1970s, it produced the sturdy and highly popularSD14 cargo ship, the Boeing 747 of the modern shipping age, morethan 150 of which were launched.   Today, the self-assuredness of industrial might has given way touncertainty, as its municipal museum illustrates in the recordedcommentary accompanying a slide show of its history.   ``Sunderland,'' it says, ``is no longer the grimy, pulsatingindustrial metropolis it was. It's cleaner, less clouded, muchhealthier. But not perhaps much happier. The heart is not there now.The busy river that gave life to the town... is an emptiness thatthe planners seek to fill _ to landscape for leisure the banks thatwere once crammed with industry, commerce, homes, and life.   ``Sunderland is a town with a great past. Now we're looking for anew kind of future.''</TEXT></DOC>
