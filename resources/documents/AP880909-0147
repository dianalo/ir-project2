(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL bankruptcy trustee Fridayextended indefinitely the deadline to accept bids for the ministry,and said Jim Bakker provided no proof he has the money to back uphis $172 million offer to buy back the television network andreligious theme park he founded.   Bakker left a two-hour meeting with trustee M.C. ``Red'' Bentonat PTL's executive offices behind two security guards who knockeddown several television cameramen in their rush to leave thebuilding at PTL's Heritage USA Christian theme park.   Bakker would only tell reporters: ``We're all working on it.It's going good. It's going great.''   Neither Bakker nor his attorney, Jim Toms, could be reached forfurther comment.   Benton, however, said: ``I think he's exhausted ... about alloffers he can in this situation. Certainly we were not assured''that Bakker has the funds.   When asked if Bakker's deal was falling through, Benton said,``Evidently it's not obvious to him (Bakker).''   The trustee said the latest deadline he had set to accept offersfor the ministry _ 5 p.m. Friday _ has been extended indefinitely.   And he said he may soon talk to Canadian real estate executivePeter Thomas, who had offered $113 million for PTL but withdrew theoffer earlier this week.   ``I want to make it clear that we can't tell you anythingpositive today,'' Benton told reporters. ``We're sort of in aquandary at this point. We may be at that point where we talk tohim (Thomas).''   Benton had given Bakker until Friday to come up with $3 millionto secure his officer and to show proof that funds exist for theoverall loan.   PTL filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Courtin Columbia, S.C., in June 1987, three months after Bakker admittedhaving a sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn andleft the ministry.   Benton, who met Thursday with unidentified Canadian investorswho were interested in buying the ministry's assets, has said he isconsidering other offers. He did say the investors were not Thomasor his associates.   Benton has declined to give details of those offers. He said hewill report the status of negotiations to U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeRufus Reynolds on Monday. The judge had said he wanted Benton torecommend a buyer by that point.</TEXT></DOC>
