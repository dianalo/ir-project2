The rule changes, announced Saturday by HHS Secretary Otis Bowen, are designed to carry out President Reagan's abortion policy, which he set forth in a July 30 address.    Dr. Bowen said the department's objective is to strengthen and clarify regulations prohibiting the use of federal dollars for abortion or abortion-related activities under Title X of the Public Health Service Act.    &quot;These regulations make it perfectly clear that your tax dollars and mine will not be spent subsidizing or promoting abortion through the family-planning program,&quot; he said in a statement.    Under the proposed rules, clinics receiving Title X family-planning grants would be required to separate financially and physically their federally funded program from any abortion-related activities, Dr. Bowen said. Separate waiting and examining rooms would be required, as would separate office entrances and exits.    Clinics would be prohibited from using Title X funds to counsel women on abortion or to refer a pregnant woman to a doctor for an abortion.    &quot;It is unrealistic to assume that counseling and referrals concerning abortion do not promote or encourage abortion,&quot; Dr. Bowen asserted. &quot;The proposed regulations should remove the possibility of biasing the woman's decision toward abortion.&quot;    In addition, the proposed rules would prohibit federally funded clinics from lobbying lawmakers for pro-choice legislation, and from developing or disseminating pamphlets that advocate abortion as a method of family planning.    During this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the department's Title X program will dispense $142.4 million for family planning and related services through 3,900 clinics, which serve 4.3 million clients.    The public has 60 days to file comments on the proposed rules, which will be published this week in the Federal Register. The department must consider any comments before issuing its final rules.    Family-planning groups are very likely to challenge the new regulations in court. </TEXT></DOC>
