The publisher, meanwhile, is considering labeling unsold copiesof Salman Rushdie's book with an apology in an effort to defuse theprotests, a London newspaper reported today.   Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in Lebanon and Iran onSunday in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order Feb. 14that Moslems seek out and kill the British author and his publishers.   The Press Trust of India news agency reported that today'sbombing in Jammu-Kashmir state was aimed at police who were tryingto prevent demonstrators from closing shops in Srinagar. However, aMoslem civilian was killed instead and seven people were injured,including a police officer and two news photographers, Press Trustsaid.   The news agency said the demonstrators were trying to enforce ageneral strike to protest Friday's police gunfire during riotingover the novel in Bombay. Nine people were shot and killed.   At least 18 people have been killed since Feb. 12 in India andPakistan in violence related to ``The Satanic Verses.''   On Sunday, a bomb blast killed a guard outside a British culturalcenter in Karachi, Pakistan, police said.   Police identified the victim as Mohammad Shafi, 65, and said theexplosion destroyed the building's guard room.   Asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over Rushdie'snovel, one officer said, ``It appears that way.'' He spoke oncondition of anonymity.   In London, a senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergencymeeting of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain said hardback copiesof the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition, due outin August, might be delayed for ``crude commercial'' reasons.   But the editor denied reports that Viking Penguin was consideringcanceling the paperback edition to appease Moslems who consider thebook blasphemous.   ``We are continuing to make the book available,'' he was quotedas telling The Guardian, a London newspaper. ``It's simply notpossible to keep up with demand.''   ``If there is a way to keep the book in print and prevent furtherloss of life, and if the way to do that is print some form ofapology, then maybe we should do that,'' he was quoted as saying. Heasked not to be identified because of the death threats.   Viking Penguin refused to comment today on its plans for the book.   Thousands of American Moslems protested the novel over theweekend in Boston and New York.   About 5,000 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of Rushdieduring a march in Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday.   Tehran television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstratedin the holy city of Qom, chanting ``We are at your serviceKhomeini'' and ``Death to America!''   Rushdie, 41, was born to a Moslem family in India. He has been inhiding since Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him and Iranianclerics put a bounty on his head of up to $5.2 million.   Rushdie has apologized for any distress his novel caused, butKhomeini rejected the overture.   The 12 European Community countries as well as Norway, Sweden,and Canada have recalled their ambassadors from Iran in protest, andIran has retaliated by withdrawing its top envoys from thosecountries.   Iran's parliament is to vote Tuesday on whether to severrelations with Britain because of the furor over ``The SatanicVerses.''   The nation's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported todaythat newspapers believed such a move would be a ``practical step''and would reflect Khomeini's position that relations with the Westare unnecessary.   Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives of theprophet Mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from Allah.   The book has been banned in Iran, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Jordan,Egypt, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Brunei.</TEXT></DOC>
