The plan, which was sent today to the leaders of the five Central American nations as they gathered for a summit meeting, closely follows an outline drawn up by Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas. The proposal says the U.S. would end military aid to Nicaragua's Contras if Nicaragua accepts a cease-fire and agrees to significant internal political changes by Sept. 30.    As part of the plan, the administration has pledged that it won't propose new military aid for the rebels or launch a lobbying campaign for Contra aid before the Sept. 30 deadline, Rep. Wright said after meeting with President Reagan.    Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega last night sought to put the focus on the U.S., and downplay the regional aspects of the plan, as he offered to meet with U.S. officials to discuss the proposal. But reactions from Nicaraguan officials through the day were mixed, and Mr. Ortega, echoing the skepticism expressed earlier by his foreign minister, warned that a refusal by the U.S. to meet with Nicaraguan officials would reveal the plan as merely a move to appease Congress.    In the past, Nicaragua has consistently declined to negotiate changes in the way it conducts its internal affairs. Even proponents of the new plan acknowledge it faces major tests.    And critics are calling the proposal impractical because it will be difficult for the countries of Central America to reach agreement on the plan's cease-fire elements, regional security measures and broad political changes by Sept. 30.    But by deciding to move in step with Rep. Wright, Mr. Reagan has given his Nicaragua policy something it has often lacked: an appearance of high-level bipartisan support. By seeking such bipartisan backing and illustrating that he is willing to endorse diplomatic as well as military initiatives in Nicaragua, Mr. Reagan may well bolster his case for more Contra aid if the plan fails to take hold.    &quot;I applaud this bipartisan effort in Congress, and I express the hope that it will produce a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Nicaragua,&quot; Mr. Reagan said in an appearance in the White House press room. The administration openly attributed much of the authorship of the plan to Rep. Wright; at one point in a news briefing, Secretary of State George Shultz called it a &quot;plan that the speaker has put forward.&quot;    In addition to the cease-fire, the plan calls for an end to Cuban and Soviet military aid to Nicaragua at the same time the U.S. ends military aid for the Contras. The proposal specifies, however, that humanitarian aid could continue to flow both to the Nicaraguan government and the Contras.    The proposal also calls for suspending an emergency law in effect in Nicaragua, granting amnesty to Contra rebels and establishing an independent electoral commission and election procedures and timetables. &quot;Excess&quot; foreign military advisers would be withdrawn from Nicaragua and its neighbors, and negotiations would begin among the U.S. and Central American countries on regional security guarantees.    The plan entails some risk for President Reagan, whose proposal has already upset his most conservative supporters. They believed that favorable public response to Lt. Col. Oliver North and other former White House aides at the Iran-Contra congressional hearings had paved the way for an aggressive, new administration drive for more Contra aid. And they are upset that the president has indicated some willingness to drop military aid.    &quot;There certainly are some of us who have very, very deep concerns about the direction this is going,&quot; said Sen. William Armstrong (R., Colo.). &quot;We've got the momentum on our side for the first time.&quot; He complained that the administration has offered to forgo aid and didn't &quot;get anything&quot; for its willingness.    Sen. Jesse Helms, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, derided the plan as having the &quot;gauzy contours of a grand dream,&quot; and the North Carolina conservative served notice that he won't wait until Sept. 30 to try to force a vote on new military aid for the Contras.    The risks seem much higher for Rep. Wright. Some of his colleagues think the administration's endorsement of the peace plan is little more than a ploy to increase chances of winning Contra aid later. But Rep. Wright was interested in a diplomatic initiative because he is a new, activist speaker and intensely proud of his knowledge of Central America and ability to speak Spanish.    The administration approached Mr. Wright through his fellow Texan, former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, who was recently hired by the White House to oversee the effort to win Contra aid.    &quot;If there is any realistic chance that this is going to work, I can't let my reticence stand in the way,&quot; Mr. Wright said in an interview. He said he told the president to &quot;wage peace as you wage war&quot; and warned that the administration can't be holding out the &quot;olive branch&quot; and hitting Nicaragua over the head with a &quot;crowbar.&quot;    Mr. Wright said he met in private with the Nicaraguan ambassador about two weeks ago. He said he has also discussed the idea with Costa Rican and Salvadoran officials as well as Sergio Ramirez, the vice president of Nicaragua, and has received some encouraging signals.    In the past, the Reagan administration has launched diplomatic initiatives and sent special representatives to the region shortly before seeking military aid for the Contras.    This time, Congressional leaders of both parties firmly maintain that they haven't agreed to any connection between the administration's new initiative in Central America and a commitment by the Congress to vote for Contra aid. &quot;There can be no quid-pro-quo between the plan and, on the other hand, Contra aid,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) Sen. Byrd also complained that the Sept. 30 deadline was &quot;unrealistic,&quot; and that a measure of the administration's &quot;good faith&quot; would be the inclusion in the talks of an independent observer group that can report to Congress.    ---   Jeffrey H.
