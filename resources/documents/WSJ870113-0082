Today, LTV is in bankruptcy court. Gulf andamp; Western has shed half its businesses and narrowed its focus since its founder died four years ago. But Textron is back to its old ways, buying and selling companies to grow bigger and richer and remain independent.    In the past two years, the Providence, R.I.-based company has made two big acquisitions and raised $750 million by selling businesses. And as soon as Textron's chairman and president, Beverly F. Dolan, pares the company's debt, he plans to buy something else, preferably something big. &quot;You do better by selecting a large target,&quot; he says. &quot;There's less competition.&quot;    To be sure, Textron isn't the last of the 1960s-style conglomerates. Another survivor is Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, with businesses ranging from insurance to dental instruments and a billion-dollar stock portfolio. &quot;But,&quot; says Kevin Clark, a Value Line Inc. analyst, &quot;the days when conglomerate executives thought they could manage a group of unrelated businesses the way a mutual fund manages investments are gone.&quot;    Apparently, no one told Bev Dolan, the 59-year-old Georgian who was promoted to chief executive of Textron two years ago after negotiating the $1.4 billion acquisition of Avco Corp., an aerospace and financial services company. Soon after making good on its promise to reduce Textron's debt by $1 billion in 18 months, Textron borrowed another $1 billion to buy Ex-Cell-O Corp., a maker of aerospace and auto parts, for $1.05 billion. It now promises to pay off $800 million in debt by the end of 1988's first quarter.    &quot;I like the conglomerate form of business because we can change our bets around. We can change our businesses rather swiftly,&quot; Mr. Dolan says. Besides, he adds, &quot;That's all I've ever known. I grew up in Textron.&quot; Mr. Dolan was 32 years old when he and his brother sold their E-Z-Go golf cart business to Textron in 1960. Textron still owns the company -- it had record earnings last year, he says proudly -- and his eldest son sells E-Z-Go golf carts in Miami.    Mr. Dolan's aggressiveness recalls the strategies of Royal Little, who turned the New England textile company into the original conglomerate. &quot;This is the first time an entrepreneur is running the company since I retired (in 1961) and it makes a difference,&quot; says Mr. Little, now 90, no longer formally affiliated with Textron. &quot;When I retired, we had first a banker, then a lawyer, then an accountant and then we had a very conservative chairman who didn't buy any companies.&quot;    Roughly two-thirds of Textron's revenue and profit last year came from its manufacturing businesses. They range from aerospace -- helicopters, aircraft engines and components -- to auto parts, packaging machines, watchbands and pens. Consumer finance and insurance accounted for the other third.    Acquisitions won't be limited to those areas, Mr. Dolan says. He is most comfortable with manufacturing businesses, he says, but looked closely at a move into the health-care industry before rejecting it. Basically, Mr. Dolan targets companies that have completed restructuring, that have good operating management in place and have relatively little debt. Then he waits for an &quot;unusual circumstance&quot; and pounces. At Avco, the trigger was a takeover bid from Irwin L. Jacobs, a Minneapolis investor. At Ex-Cell-O, Mr. Dolan says, it was a bungled stock-repurchase program.    In the early part of the 1980s, Textron was a lousy ad for conglomerates. Its earnings stagnated and its stock lacked luster. &quot;I tried to convince them (Textron's management) if they didn't expand, someone would take them over,&quot; Mr. Little recalls. His fears were justified. In 1984, Chicago Pacific Corp. unsuccessfully attempted a takeover. Textron repelled the bid, but was left vulnerable to another bidder. A month later, Textron bought Avco.    Looking back, Mr. Dolan -- who was then chief operating officer -- says Textron was &quot;seriously underleveraged,&quot; was too dependent on its Bell helicopter business and had gone too long without a big acquisition. In short, it had abandoned Mr. Little's readiness to buy and sell companies aggressively.    Since succeeding Robert P. Straetz as chief executive, Mr. Dolan has changed all that. So far, his strategy is a winner. In 1985, Textron finally earned as much as it had in 1979. And, thanks to strong performance from its aerospace and manufacturing businesses, the company pegs 1986 net at between $5.75 and $6 a share. In 1985, Textron had profit from continuing operations of $4.83 a share. Textron's stock has more than doubled in the past two years, outpacing the market. (Every time it reaches a new high, Mr. Dolan tapes a note to the inside of his office door.)    Textron shares closed yesterday at $68.125, up 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    But Textron's shares still sell at a lower price-earnings multiple than the market as a whole -- and that bothers Mr. Dolan. Of course, that has been a perennial problem of conglomerates. Some analysts say conglomerates' extreme diversification makes them too hard for Wall Street to understand and, more significantly, too hard for executives to manage. &quot;The investment community today tends to prefer to see some focus and deconglomerization,&quot; says Lawrence Lytton, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst.    The pieces of a conglomerate, the argument goes, often are worth more than the whole. Indeed, Alan Bernstein, an Oppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst, figures that Textron's businesses could be sold for $92 a share.    Mr. Dolan counters that Wall Street would overlook its reservations about conglomerates if Textron had a higher return on equity, a common measure of corporate profitability. His goal is to boost it to 18%, a level it hasn't reached since 1968. That will take some doing: Textron's 1986 return on equity isn't likely to top 15% despite its heavy debt load, which tends to increase the measure. Textron's return on equity for the nine months was 14%.    In the near term, however, Mr. Dolan's priority is figuring out what assets to sell to pay off the acquisition-related debt. After buying Avco, Textron moved quickly to sell slow-growing manufacturing businesses -- machine tools, staplers, printing inks, gas meters -- that had been holding down Textron's profits for years.    This time the choices aren't so obvious. Mr. Dolan says suggestions that Ex-Cell-O's machine tool businesses are likely to go are &quot;very logical.&quot; And although he rejects predictions by some analysts that Textron will sell Avco's financial services businesses, he hints at some sort of &quot;financial engineering&quot; in that sector, perhaps selling a minority interest to the public.    Beyond that, Mr. Dolan won't say what businesses will go, and instead offers a maxim for conglomerates: &quot;The way to run a successful real estate company is, you get 10 salesmen and at the end of every month the bottom guy is gone.&quot;    &quot;It's not a bad motivator,&quot; he says. &quot;I think our people feel that pressure and that doesn't bother me a damn bit.&quot;    Mr. Dolan's style is low-key and informal. He sips Diet Coke from a can during an interview. And until recently, the man who earned more than $1.2 million last year changed the channels on his television at home with a pair of pliers because the knob had broken.    But few at Textron mistake his easygoing manner for softness. One day last week Mr. Dolan made a business call to the new manager of Textron's Homelite power-saw business at his Charlotte, N.C., office before 8 a.m. &quot;I was just testing him,&quot; he says. (The manager passed the test.)    And when asked if Textron's Gorham silverware unit, which performed poorly last year, still has the same management, Mr. Dolan replies: &quot;Today.&quot;    ---           TEXTRON'S CHANGING LINEUP OF BUSINESS              Revenue, in millions of dollars                                    1984            1986*    Financial services                2%             29%    Aerospace technology             34              50    Consumer/industrial products     64              21    Total:                       $3,283          $6,720   *Includes results of Ex-Cell-O Corp. only for fourthquarter   Source: Textron Inc.; estimates by Oppenheimer andamp; Co.
