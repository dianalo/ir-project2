The House Energy and Power Subcommittee yesterday unanimously approved a bill that effectively would end the act's restrictions. The Senate Energy Committee cleared similar legislation about two weeks ago, after a compromise was reached between coal producers and the electric utility and natural gas industries.    The key to the bill's sudden progress is support from the National Coal Association, a coal producers' trade group that blocked a similar bill last year by pushing amendments that would have required any large new gas-burning plant to be capable of burning coal. Utilities and gas producers protested that this would require utilities and industrial plants to build far larger, more expensive boilers and reserve land for coal storage, even when they initially planned to burn only gas.    The legislation in both houses would require new gas plants to be able to convert to coal, rather than being built to burn both gas and coal, according to congressional staff members.    Tony Anthony, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utilities trade group, said, &quot;We support the compromise because it will give us the flexibility to build combined-cycle plants&quot; that can burn gas with high efficiency in turbines and boilers together. Such plants can be connected to separate units that convert coal to low-energy gas, he said.    Mr. Anthony's group estimates that building a combined-cycle gas plant costs less than $600 per kilowatt of capacity, compared with $1,350 per kilowatt for a coal-fired unit. A coal gasifier together with a combined-cycle plant, he said, would cost $1,300 to $1,500 per kilowatt of capacity, but would operate more efficiently than a coal-fired boiler.    The efficiency of combined-cycle plants has made them attractive to utilities that are leery of building large new plants and that need extra capacity to meet demand for power during peak periods.    Congressional staffers said it became clear this year that the gas industry had enough support in Congress to repeal the Fuel Use Act. The Reagan administration has supported repeal and has granted widespread exemptions to the act to industries seeking to build gas-fired boilers.    Yesterday, the House subcommittee rejected in a 13-9 party line vote a Republican move to attach decontrol of natural gas prices to the Fuel Use Act legislation. Democrats said that gas decontrol remains too hotly contested to receive prompt congressional action.    Lawmakers in both houses of Congress said the repeal bill is scheduled for quick enactment, with Senate floor action expected within a few weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
