Tell 'em.    As a surfer getting ready to wrap up 20 years of deep involvement with the California coast -- a claim made in hopes of lending credibility to this review -- I have few reservations in holding up &quot;The California Coastal Resource Guide&quot; as a book both comprehensive in scope and exacting in detail. With its attention to culture and history, its concern for the state's fragile coastal environment, and its visual layering of line-art, photographs and maps, the &quot;Guide&quot; (edited by Madge Caughman and Joanne S. Ginsberg, University of California Press, $29.95 hard-cover, $14.95 paperback) emerges as a fully realized work -- one that may be fundamentally impossible to improve upon.    Dude, dude, hold on. Check it out. Now, the book's not totally bogus, or anything. But you know what would have made the thing just killer? If they would have, like, put some stories in it. Some way gnarly surf stories. Like that shark attack last year at Tunitas Beach? Near San Francisco? Whoa! This dude was sitting out there waiting for a wave, and this Great White cruised over and just took this humongous bite out of his surfboard! Then let the dude go! That was insane! See, full-on gnarly stories like that.    A shallow case could be made in favor of inserting a handful of anecdotes to lend a lighter tone, but logistics work against such an addition. At 384 pages, coffee-table format, the &quot;Guide&quot; really couldn't shoulder any more information. And what it lacks in color, it makes up for in conscientiousness.    Concern for California's coastal environment -- which the editors feel lost its purity in the late 1700s, with the arrival of the settlers -- is the moral glue that holds &quot;The California Coastal Resource Guide&quot; together. The introduction wastes little time before entering a level-toned recount of 200 years of statewide environmental atrocities. The book, in fact, is dedicated to Ansel Adams, who is described as a &quot;. . . a hero of the environmental cause, and a symbol of the land he loved.&quot;    There was this dude, Barney Adams -- maybe it's Ansel's kid, or something -- he used to surf out at Steamer Lane, and the guy was just a full-on poser. A total dweeb. That's why, see, if it was up to me, I'd dedicate the thing to Tom Curren. He's world champion, man. He's a Santa Barbara local, and he's, like, way radical. Last month, me and my friend, Rat, we show up at Rincon, and the waves are pumping. So we're scoping the situation, kicking back, and all of a sudden this guy gets this insane barrel, then does a full-on airplane floater, then a full-on wraparound cutback, then a full-on snap reentry. Rat looks at me, and he's all, &quot;Whoa, dude!&quot; And I'm all, &quot;Dude, we're out there!&quot;    I'd dedicate the book to Tom Curren, for sure. Plus, I mean, &quot;Ansel?&quot; Get a name, dude! And if you're such an unreal photographer, how come you couldn't do nothing in color? Huh?    &quot;Coastal Geography&quot; and &quot;Living Resources,&quot; the first two sections of the &quot;Guide,&quot; have a utility, textbook feel, and are slightly numbing. In the editors' defense, though, lively prose must be a tall order when example topics include diversity of arthropods, and the ascending levels of intertidal zonation.    The less scientifically inclined might skip ahead to the next section, cultural resources, which opens with an eight-page California coastal timeline. Although little support is given by the clunky accompanying graphics, most of the timeline's bites are sharp and interesting, particularly those from the past 100 years. Examples: 1964: 12-foot-high waves generated by Alaskan earthquake destroy Crescent City's central business district. 1961: The Beach Boys rock group is formed. 1907: Surfing is introduced to California at Redondo Beach, by George Freeth.    Awww, dude, remember that all-night rager in Redondo, last summer? When Rat spewed all over that girl's mom's bedroom slippers? And the Grub found that old longboard in the garage, nuded-up and said he was going to paddle to Catalina? Total rage, or what! That party was killer! Fully!    But the heart of the &quot;Guide&quot; comes in the &quot;Coastal Counties&quot; section, which successfully laminates practicality, history, scientific interest and environmental soul. In this section, the entire, 1,100-mile western edge of the state is divided into 16 counties. Each area gets a general overview, then is examined beach-by-beach, with basic highway directions, a brief history, and lists of cultural points of interest, noteworthy sealife, indigenous flora and fauna, as well as available parking, camping and picnic facilities. This is where the editors set out -- with a fine blend of affection and organization -- to sketch in the hundreds of coastal shadings found along California's western border: the jagged and dark cliffs of Marin County; the wind-carved sand dunes of Pismo Beach; the condo-lined edges of Los Angeles County; the silent, underwater communities of the Point Loma tide pools.    The look of &quot;The California Coastal Resource Guide&quot; improves here as well, with a varied use of two-color maps, modern and historic photographs, and line drawings. -   No gift certificates, though. How bitchin' would it be if they would have put, like, some McDonald's gift certificates in there? Or 7-Eleven, maybe? 'Cause if you're into a major surf scope, up the coast, down the coast, whatever, you gotta stop and grind, right? Basic, man.    More than 85% of California's inhabitants now live within 30 miles of the ocean, and western migration in the U.S. remains a strong force. As the population grows, so must concern for the area's resources. Enjoyment and utilization of the California coast needs to be tempered with responsibility for its well-being. This is the message of the &quot;California Coastal Resource Guide.&quot;    Yeah, I was thinking about that -- all these unlocal dudes moving in and stuff, and how bogus it'll be with these kooks and geeks in the water. But then I thought, Whoa! New babes, too! Could be some insane parties.    ---   Mr. Warshaw is managing editor of Surfer Magazine. </TEXT></DOC>
