The charges are contained in a motion filed in U.S. DistrictCourt Friday in connection with the civil case in which thePhilippine government is seeking $5 billion it says Marcos, hisfamily and associates looted from their country.   The motion accused Imelda Marcos and her deceased husband'sworldwide network of bankers, agents and associates of``liquidating, squandering and concealing assets belonging to thePhilippines'' in violation of a 1986 injunction.   Court papers also alleged the Marcoses spent $2.8 million andencumbered an additional $200 million in their Swiss bank accountsto purchase arms for a planned invasion of the Philippines.   Lawyers for the Philippines requested that a June court order bemodified to ``more closely monitor, control and account for theMarcoses' expenditures, transactions, and assets, in order toprevent further violations.''   The motion alleges the Marcoses ``fraudulently transferred'' toSaudi arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi ownership and control over twoNew York buildings, four related corporations and at least oneSwiss bank account allegedly worth more than $100 million.   The allegations against the Marcoses and Khashoggi closelyparallel some of the charges in a federal criminal indictmentbrought against the trio in New York City in October 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
