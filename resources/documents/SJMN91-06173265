They show, among other things,that the newspaper group that made big bucks exposing the problems of the richand famous is now having some problems of its own.;    There's littleopportunity to hide skeletons from the SEC. Strict rules demand that companiesissuing stock bare all, so that regulators and investors know what they'regetting.;    While Enquirer/Star has its problems, it's far from dead. Aperennial cash-cow, the National Enquirer is an American institution thatcontinues to increase circulation and revenues, even when the rest of thenewspaper industry is struggling.;    Still, there are some nagging doubtsabout the future of the company and its publications. Television imitators arestealing readers.;    A dearth of Hollywood mega-stars has forced tabloids torely on lesser lights. And print competitors of all kinds now scramble onstories that once were the Enquirer's exclusive fare.;    The result: Someinvestment experts are skeptical about the true value of Enquirer/Star Group'sstock offering.;    &quot;I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole,&quot; said Roy Akers,first vice president and manager of Advest Inc., a Lauderhill, Fla., brokeragefirm.;    Added Mark Sheinbaum, branch manager at Fuhrman-Matt SecuritiesInc., in Lake Worth: It's in financial trouble and its debt is huge.;    Theskepticism starts with Enquirer/Star Group's bottom line. Documents show thatin fiscal 1991, the company lost $6.2 million, or $1.75 a share, on revenuesof $240 million.;    Inside the prospectus, there are tales of layoffs,cutbacks and plant closings in South Florida, while executives earnedsix-figure salaries. Documents also show that the company lent several seniorexecutives millions of dollars, not a penny of which must be paid back until1994.;    Then there are the lawsuits. In the past three years, the companypaid $5.4 million for settlements, legal fees and libel insurance, documentsshow. As of May 15, it was defending six libel suits. It recently settled onebrought by a favorite celebrity target, Elizabeth Taylor, but the terms werenot disclosed.;    The most dramatic part of the untold story, however, is howthe late Generoso Pope Jr.'s once high-rolling company fell into the mostpedestrian of business traps: debt-based growth.;    Now it's trying towriggle free. By floating 20.5 million shares of stock at a price of $17,Enquirer/Star Group, which also owns Star and Weekly World News tabloids,hopes to raise more than $300 million and ease its debt of $466 million.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Lantana, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910621  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  470  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 21, 199100173265,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
