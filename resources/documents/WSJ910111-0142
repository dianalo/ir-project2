Some investment strategists have forecast a sustainedswing away from cyclical stocks in the U.K. because of theperceived length and breadth of the recession. Butpharmaceutical companies, with their international exposure,expanding drug portfolios and streamlining plans, appear setto gain relative to the rest of the market, analysts say.</LP><TEXT>   Last year the sector outperformed the Financial TimesAll-Share Index by 10%, according to research by ShearsonLehman Brothers. The securities house predicts that thesector will outperform the index by about 12% this year.   But news that Sweden's Astra Group has received approvalto market its anti-ulcer drug Losec in the U.S. has been feltin the share price of Glaxo Holdings PLC, which markets theleading ulcer treatment, Zantac. During 1990, Glaxo sharesmoved from a high of 882 pence ($16.74) to a low of 669pence, and currently trade at around 816.   Other major U.K. drug companies also face the threat ofencroachment into their market by foreign rivals, as well asthe longer-term problem of government reluctance to foot thebill for health care.   Jo Walton, pharmaceutical analyst at Shearson, citedenforced price cuts for drug companies selling to the U.S.Medicaid system. Ms. Walton said the cuts are &quot;indicative ofthe threat of cost awareness&quot; prevalent in the industry.   Barclay de Zoete Wedd (BZW) Ltd.'s pharmaceutical teamsaid the effect of government pressures on health carespending will be felt gradually, but acknowledged that theproblem is genuine.   And Shearson's Ms. Walton said reduced government spendinghasn't dented the pace of research at U.K. drug companies,which fully matches that of foreign competitors. She addedthat expenditures for research and development outmatchcurrent growth in the drug market itself.   With an estimated 40% share of sales within thepharmaceutical sector, Glaxo is the bellwether stock of thegroup, and BZW and Kleinwort Benson Securities expect it toshow the strongest performance within the market.   On Monday, Glaxo received U.S. marketing approval for theinjectable form of its Zofran drug, used to prevent nauseaand vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapytreatment.   Shearson's Ms. Walton said that in 1990, the U.S. marketfor drugs to fight chemotherapy-induced sickness was worth$125 million. She said she expects the U.S. market's worth torise to $520 million by 1993, with Glaxo holding a 15% sharefor the drug's oral version and a 45% share for itsinjectable alternative.   Zofran is one of several drugs Glaxo is due to introducethis year, and it is expected to cushion the company againsta possible profit decline in its leading ulcer treatment,Zantac.   Regulatory approval is being sought for Glaxo's asthmatreatment Serevent in the U.S. and for the migraine drugImigran in the U.K., U.S. and various European markets.   But the weak link in Glaxo's chain is the threat posed bySweden's Astra, with its rival ulcer treatment, Losec.Analysts said Losec poses a genuine threat to Zantac, andAstra is making claims that its product now controls about50% of the global anti-ulcer treatment market.   Meanwhile, Ian White at Kleinwort Benson Securitiesestimated that Glaxo's new products could make up a third ofthe company's total sales in five years. He added thatGlaxo's involvement in developing a treatment for acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, in collaboration withCanada's IAF BioChem, while not central to the company'sportfolio at this time, is &quot;more important than the stockmarket thinks.&quot;   Ms. Walton is less optimistic over Glaxo's anticipatedperformance in 1991, forecasting a contraction of profitmargins because of heavy foreign-exchange losses. Analystssuggest that about 40% of Glaxo sales come from the U.S.,where the dollar has weakened.   Ms. Walton says the strongest growth in the U.K. drugsector will be achieved by SmithKline-Beecham PLC.   SmithKline-Beecham should report per-share earnings growthof 20% in 1991, Ms. Walton says. She added that the companyis likely to benefit from continued cost-saving following themerger in July 1989 between Beecham Group PLC of the U.K. andSmithKline Beckman Corp. of the U.S., as well as the disposalof non-core businesses.   In the third quarter, SmithKline-Beecham reported thatsales of its peptic ulcer treatment Tagamet fell 12% becauseof generic competition in the U.K. and a government-mandatedprice cut in Japan. In 1990 the company shares moved from a634 pence high, down to 460, and are currently trading around604.   Kleinwort's Mr. White said Tagamet sales will continue tofall, but the decline will be softened by rising sales ofAugmentin, a treatment for penicillin-resistant infections.   Elsewhere, sales for Wellcome PLC's two leading drugs,Retrovir and Zovirax, rose 27% and 28%, respectively, in theyear to September, but analysts are mixed as to thevulnerability of Wellcome drugs to competition.</TEXT></DOC>
