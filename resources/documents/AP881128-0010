The march of freedom seemed inexorable.   For the 210 million people in the seven nations _ Ecuador, Peru,Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Suriname _ the return ofelected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom andthe restoration of human rights.   Now the bright, shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished.   Growing disenchantment is evident in several countries, mostlybecause of dashed expectations that an end to political repressionwould bring economic improvement. It hasn't proved that simple.   Nonetheless, democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure,spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule.   Chile's citizenry, rallying behind the slogan ``the joy iscoming,'' voted to end Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 15-year tenure aspresident and hold elections in December, 1989.   Only tiny Paraguay, run by aging, authoritarian AlfredoStroessner since 1954, remains totally outside the democratic fold.   And despite the occasional rattling of sabers, and a few dramaticbut isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries, fewobservers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent.   ``When you have inflation of 1,000 percent a year, you obviouslyget unhappy people, but that doesn't mean they're inviting a returnto military rule,'' said Paul Sigmund, a politics professor atPrincton University and an expert on the Latin American armed forces.   ``The military doesn't have a solution to these problems,'' hesaid in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``In the1960s they thought they had the answers. They don't think they dotoday.   ``The notion that somehow they could do it better has beendisproved by their own experience.''   In most South American countries economic mismanagement orcorruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributedto the return of civilian rule. But some of the new civiliangovernments have not proven much more adept at handling thecontinent's most urgent, and persistent, problem: grinding poverty.   Peru is considered the most volatile example. The inflation rateis expected to surpass 1,000 percent, the economy is stagnant andlittle if any headway has been made in improving the plight of ahungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a Maoist guerrillaorganization, the Shining Path.   President Alan Garcia was considered one of Peru's new generationof charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985. But hispopularity has plummeted because of what critics see as avacillating economic policy, especially since he alienatedconservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalizeforeign banks in 1987.   A recent survey by a Lima-based polling firm, Datum, found that60 percent of Peruvians don't believe a military coup is likelybefore Garica's term ends in 1990. But 28 percent do _ a sign thatdemocracy's foundations are less than rock-solid.   ``If our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutionscontinue demonstrating ineffectiveness, the totalitarian temptationwill visit us sooner or later,'' said a Peruvian political analyst,Luis Pasara.   Brazil and Argentina also are plagued by economic and socialinstability, with sky-high inflation rates and tens of thousands ofworkers striking daily for better pay, paralyzing many basicservices such as transportation and the mail.   Brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of governmentcorruption, nepotism and waste. Retired Gen. Joao Figueiredo, thelast in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985,told citizens to ``forget me'' when he handed over power to acivilian. Now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him toreturn to office.   A popular bumper sticker in bustling Rio de Janeiro wistfullyrecalls military rule: ``I was happy and I didn't know it.''   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, another charismatic symbolof democracy's return when he assumed office in 1983, was shouteddown by hecklers during a recent speech and his Radical Party trailsthe Peronist Movement in popularity as the nation prepares forelections in May.   But such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflectperhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the newdemocracies. Freedom of expression and action has been a pledge keptby the new governments.   Most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass mediasuffers few if any restrictions. The systematic arrest, torture andkilling of dissidents that took place when troops kept order undermilitary rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and humanrights.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
