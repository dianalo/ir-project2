The men _ one a convicted murderer and the other a convictedrobber _ entered the Ukrainian prison colony's administrativebuilding Wednesday morning armed with homemade firearms and knives,the official news agency said.   The incident occurred about 500 miles south of Moscow in theVoroshilovgrad region.   According to Tass, the men took eight female employees hostage,then barricaded themselves in the building and demanded a bus andguarantees they would be allowed to leave the prison.   Regional police and KGB chiefs began negotiating with theinmates and persuaded them to release two hostages, ``but thecriminals wouldn't set the others free unless authorities agreed totheir demands,'' Tass said.   It identified the inmates as V. Maximov, serving a 15-year termfor murder and theft, and O. Korzh, sentenced to eight years inprison for robbery and malicious hooliganism. It said both wererepeat offenders.   After authorities decided to meet the demands, a bus took themen and their remaining hostages out of the penal colony.Authorities tried again to negotiate with the men as the bus nearedthe highway, Tass said.   The criminals then demanded the release of another inmate andthreatened to kill one of the hostages immediately if the demandwas not met. At that point, police decided to act, Tass said.   ``A carefully planned operation sprang into life,'' it said.``Korzh was killed on the spot and Maximov wounded.'' It said allthe hostages were freed unharmed.   On Dec. 1, a team of men commandeered a bus of children on afield trip to the Caucasus city of Ordzhonikidze, and traded themfor drugs, money and a flight to Israel. Israel, which has nodiplomatic relations with Moscow, allowed the plane to land, butdeported the hijackers the next day. The four men, plus anaccomplice, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years onMarch 17.</TEXT></DOC>
