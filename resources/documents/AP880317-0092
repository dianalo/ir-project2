FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman called the assistance ``aninterim step'' to provide needed stability to First Republic'ssubsidiaries and depositors.   Seidman said his agency, which insures deposits at commercialbanks, would guarantee all of the subsidiary banks' deposits aswell as money owed to general creditors of the banks. Creditors ofthe holding company are not protected by this arrangement, he said.   The action goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally beexpected to back up, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.   First RepublicBank is the 13th largest in the nation, with $33.2billion in assets and 73 subsidiary banks. The holding companyreported a loss of $656 million last year.   First RepublicBank acknowledged Tuesday it had been forced toseek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio anddifficulty in raising deposits.   A First RepublicBank spokesman said Wednesday the bank hadexperienced a runoff of deposits the day before, but that thesituation apparently had stabilized. An earlier drain of depositsand customer defections had forced it to begin preliminarydiscussions with the FDIC, the spokesman said.   Seidman said the FDIC was seeking a long-term solution to theholding company's problems and was talking to private investors whomay want to participate in a restructuring of the company.   He declined to be more specific, but in past transactions theagency has provided insurance money in conjunction with an infusionof funds from private investment groups.   The largest-ever bank rescue was the $4.5 billion rescue in 1984of Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust of Chicago. The FDICexpects to recoup much of its initial outlay in that bailout, andexpects its ultimate cost to be about $1.7 billion.   Seidman said he could not say what the eventual cost of theFirst Republic rescue would be. However, he noted that FirstRepublic and Continental are about the same size.   He said that unlike the case with First Continental _ a failureattributed to mismanagement _ ``it's very clear the primary reasonfor this problem is the economy of Texas.''   Seidman said the FDIC will assume some control of the subsidiarybank's operations, although not day to day. He said the currentbank's management will remain in place for now, but said changescould be discussed later.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who appeared at a news conference withSeidman, said that despite a record number of bank failures, theTexas economy is on the mend. ``We feel we're in the backwash of atidal wave that hit the Texas economy about two years ago (with thecollapse of oil prices). ... The basic economic future looks brightwhen compared to the recent past.''   The $1 billion advance is in the form of a six-month note fromthe FDIC.   The subsidiary banks are pledging their stock as collateral forthe infusion, and the parent company is guaranteeing it.   The collateral is being pledged by 29 of the subsidiary banks,representing about 80 percent of the holding company's assets.   The largest subsidiary is First RepublicBank-Dallas, with $19.5billion in assets.   Federal Reserve Board member Manuel Johnson, who also appearedat the news conference, said First Republic has been borrowing atthe Federal Reserve's discount window for the past several days. Herefused to say how much the bank had borrowed, but did say the bankhad pledged its loans and other assets to back up its borrowings.   The FDIC reported a post-Depression record of 184 bank failureslast year, more than half in the oil-rich states of Texas,Louisiana and Oklahoma.   So far this year, 38 commercial banks have failed nationally.   The First Republic aid would not have a significant impact onthe fund, Seidman said. The FDIC's insurance fund finished 1987with $18.3 billion, up slightly from the end of 1986 despite thefailures.</TEXT></DOC>
