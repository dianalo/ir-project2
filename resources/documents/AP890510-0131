When the Air Force does make refunds, it gyps other militaryservices out of their money to help cover its own budget cuts, thecongressional General Accounting Office added.   The audit found the Air Force's Stock Fund had issued $131million in refunds in fiscal 1988, with all of the refund moneygoing into the service's own operation and maintenance account eventhough the Navy, the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve,foreign governments and various other customers had purchased itemsfrom the Stock Fund that year.   The GAO said that if the refunds had been distributedproportionately, based on purchases, foreign customers would havereceived refunds totaling $18 million; the Navy, $12 million; theGuard and Reserve, $6 million; and the other customers, a combined$5 million.   ``As a result of the Stock Fund's disproportionate refundpractices, certain customers financed the refund made to the AirForce's operation and maintenance appropriation,'' the auditconcluded.   The 12-page audit, requested by the House Appropriations defensesubcommittee late last year, was released Wednesday. The Air Forcedeclined immediate comment, saying it had not received a copy.   For the most part, the audit focuses on the intricacies of ahighly technical accounting system that must deal with widefluctuations in daily cash balances. But it also shows how annualbudget and accounting changes made by Congress can cause problemsfor a government bureacracy, as well as spotlighting the internalcompetition among the armed forces when money gets tight.   The Air Force Stock Fund is simply a huge, centralized officesupply and spare parts system doing about $27 million a day in``business.''   It buys and distributes supplies and relatively inexpensiveequipment as needed by various military units. Most of the``customers'' are Air Force units, although selected units fromother services can use the Air Force system for the sake ofconvenience.   To ensure that enough money is on hand every day to paysuppliers, the fund marks up the cost of its items by a smallamount _ generating what in the commercial sector would be a profit.   The House Appropriations panel asked the GAO to analyze theStock Fund because the Air Force says it needs to keep an operatingbalance equal to 11 days' of business, or about $297 million, andsets its mark-up accordingly.   The audit challenged the Air Force's approach, saying the 11-daystandard fails to reflect the fact that Congress now providesspecial appropriations to the Stock Fund ``to purchase war reservemateriel and inventory items to support weapon systemsmodernization and modification.''   Over the last seven years, those appropriations averaged $421million a year, the GAO said.   If the Air Force would shift to a 3-day standard and formallyacknowledge the appropriated money, the Pentagon's budget could becut automatically by $216 million in budget authority, the GAO said.   As for the refunds, the GAO said Congress had pushed the StockFund to refund a total of $711 million over the last three yearsduring annual budget reviews. The refunds were then used to offsetbudget cuts.   The only problem with that, the auditors said, was that ``therefunds were made only to selected customers and were notdistributed proportionately ... based on sales.''</TEXT></DOC>
