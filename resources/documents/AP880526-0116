North and twoco-defendands could make trying the three on conspiracy charges a``practical impossibility.''   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell raised the problem at ahearing on the difficulty resulting from immunized testimony givento Congress by North, a former National Security Council staffmember; former presidential National Security Adviser John M.Poindexter, and businessman Albert Hakim.   Gesell made no ruling on the question of proceeding with trialand is not expected to for some time.   But the judge told attorneys in the case that under normal trialprocedures, a defendant could take the stand and be questioned by aco-defendant about testimony given earlier to Congress.   Inthis case, Gesell said, none of the statements given Congressunder a grant of limited immunity from prosecution can be used attrial.   ``As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try theconspiracy counts ...'' Gesell said. ``If you try them (thedefendants) together, you violate the immunities.''   Gesell said separate trials also would raise a problem becausethe defendants might not be able to call each other as witnesses todefend their own positions. For instance, Poindexter could refuseto testify that he authorized North's activities in the Iran-Contraaffair if subpoenaed by North's lawyers.   North, Poindexter, Hakim and businessman Richard V. Secord arecharged with conspiring to turn a lawful presidential directive tosell arms to Iran into an illegal enterprise, which includedprofiting from the weapons sales and assistance to the NicaraguanContra rebels during a ban on such aid. Secord did not testifyunder an immunity grant.   Barry Simon, attorney for North, argued at the hearing that thecase should not go forward because the prosecution staff ofIndependent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and grand jury witnesses wereexposed to the immunized testimony.   ``Their testimony is being used against them,'' Simon said.``There's no way of unscrambling that problem. It is a problem thatabsolutely prevades the case.   ``You can't unscramble what witnesses now know after what theyhad seen and heard from immunized testimony, and what they (knew)before.''   While the conspiracy counts are the main charges, other chargesagainst the three include theft of government property, acceptanceof an illegal gratuity, obstruction of a congressionalinvestigation, false statements to Congress and obstruction of apresidential inquiry.   At an earlier hearing, Gesell said it also could be difficult toproceed to trial unless the government made available to thedefense thousands of classified documents in the case.   Federal officials have been sending those documents on a regularbasis to a secure facility rented by the federal government for theuse of the defendants.   Gesell did not say at today's hearing whether he remains asconcerned about the classified document problem as he had been.</TEXT></DOC>
