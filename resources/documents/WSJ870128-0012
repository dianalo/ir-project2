Ayer Inc., awarded a $100 million advertising contract to Young andamp; Rubicam Inc.    Ayer said it will take &quot;appropriate legal action&quot; against the Army &quot;to recover from the damage unjustly inflicted on this company and its reputation.&quot;    The Army had decided in October that it wouldn't extend Ayer's contract, and opened its advertising to competitve bidding. In November, Ayer was suspended from bidding on U.S. government contracts because of alleged improprieties by a former employee. It took a number of legal steps to try to overturn the government suspension so that it could compete for the Army advertising contract; those steps, however, were unsuccessful.    In an interview last night, Louis T. Hagopian, Ayer's chairman, said, &quot;We're going to sue for all of the money we spent in the resolicitation that we were encouraged to take part in as if we had an equal chance.&quot; He said the company currently is calculating how much it spent in the preparation of the Army bid, but that the figure could be as much as the low millions of dollars.    In a bitter memo to employees, Mr. Hagopian added: &quot;We are convinced that we won the resolicitation competition. Someday, we will know for sure, when the Freedom of Information Act allows us to get into that.&quot; He elaborated in the interview that he believes the Army had decided to choose Ayer, but changed its mind after Ayer was suspended from government bidding.    An Army spokesman said: &quot;N.W. Ayer was considered up until the time they were suspended. We aren't getting into if they would have won.&quot;    Closely held Ayer created the Army's highly successful &quot;Be All You Can Be&quot; campaign, and the Army was among its largest and most prestigious accounts.    The Army spokesman said the Army chose closely held Young andamp; Rubicam over five competitors, not including Ayer. He said Young andamp; Rubicam's contract would call for $100 million of print and broadcast advertising in 1987, with annual renewable options for 1988 through 1991, giving the lucrative contract a value of as much as $500 million. The contract includes advertising for the U.S. Army, the Army reserve, and the Army Reserve Officers Training Corp, or ROTC.    Alex Kroll, Young andamp; Rubicam's chairman and chief executive officer, called the award &quot;a singularly important achievement,&quot; and noted that &quot;the competition for this account was intense and challenging.&quot; Young andamp; Rubicam long has hoped to win the Army account.    The Army said the other ad agencies in the running included the New York-based agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine andamp; Osborn Inc.; DFS Dorland Worldwide Inc., a Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC unit; and SSCandamp;B:Lintas Worldwide, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. Other bidders were Ogilvy andamp; Mather, Chicago, a unit of New York-based Ogilvy Group Inc.; and Woodbridge, Va.-based Wilmar Group Ltd.    New York-based Ayer's suspension from bidding was based on Army charges that Ayer falsified time cards from 1979 to 1983 and submitted noncompetitive bids through a scheme with subcontractors. The Army also said that a former Ayer vice president pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks.    In his memo yesterday, Mr. Hagopian said: &quot;We have been treated shabbily through a three-and-one-half year investigation that has produced no formal charge or indictment against us as a company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
