<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0367 </DOCNO><TEXT>Deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are studied phenomenologicallyin the framework of a simple three-phase model. The hard-core repulsionbetween nucleons is taken into account by using an excluded volume approximationin a reformulated way. The phase consisting of coloured quarks of constituentmass, and of massless pions, is used to describe the deconfined but notyet chirally symmetric matter. The phase diagram in the plane of temperatureand Gibbs free energy per particle is constructed. The separate phasetransitions for deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry areindicated in the region of high temperature and low baryon number density.</TEXT></DOC>
