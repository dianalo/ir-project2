During the period from 1/1978 to 12/1985, 73patients with early glottic carcinoma (T1 N0 M0) were treated in theInstitute of Radiotherapy L. Galvani, University of Bologna; 45 werestage T1a (tumor limited to one vocal cord) and 28 were stage T1b (tumorof both vocal cords or involving anterior commissure); radiation treatmentutilized a /sup 60/Co machine and 5x5 cm fields; the median dose was67.2 Gy (range 50-76) with conventional fractionation. Ten patients hadlocal recurrence; the median time of recurrence was 13.4 months; 9/10were treated by surgery and 2/10 died, so the overall control by radiotherapywith surgery in reserve was 100% in T1a tumers and 90.6% in T1b ones.The 5-years disease free survival rate was 93.1% in T1a tumors and 69%in T1b; lesions involving anterior commissure had the worst prognosis,independent of the dose and time-dose factor (3/10 recurrences in thegroup treated with TDF less than 110 and 4/18 recurrences in the groupwith TDF more than 110). 22 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
