In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the SEC charged that Kurt A. Grey, vice president of the Los Angeles-based food-processing concern, which was formerly called Early California Industries Inc., in late 1984 had provided Dean Witter broker John E. Kilfoyle with nonpublic information regarding a $10-a-share tender offer for more than 50% of the company's stock by an investor group called Gammon Group. The complaint alleges that Mr. Kilfoyle improperly used the information to trade stock for a friend of Mr. Grey's, who was also a client of Mr. Kilfoyle. The friend wasn't identified in the suit.    Without admitting or denying guilt, Mr. Grey agreed to an injunction preventing him from committing the alleged violations in the future, and agreed to pay $48,250 for the amount he allegedly made on the stock trades, plus a one-time civil penalty of $48,250. Mr. Kilfoyle agreed to pay $1,600, representing his alleged sales credit on the transactions. Mssrs. Grey and Kilfoyle weren't immediately available for comment.    Dean Witter is a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
