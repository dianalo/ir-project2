MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   By now, in the fifth year of Terry Anderson'scaptivity, there are rituals in the hostage impasse, tormentingroutines played over and over again.   At home there are prayers and pleas. Abroad, there are demands.In the government there is a litany: No deals, but every avenuethat might lead to freedom for eight captive Americans is beingpursued.   Except that there are no known avenues at this point.   All of it came together at Anderson's 42nd birthday, his fifthas a hostage, observed Friday at Mass in a Georgetown Universitychapel, sponsored by a volunteer organization called No GreaterLove.   It was the 20th event that group had sponsored in behalf of thehostages in Lebanon. It was the 1,686th day in captivity forAnderson, chief of Middle East services for The Associated Press.It was national Hostage Awareness Day by act of Congress, althoughnot a lot of people seemed to be aware of it.   In the Senate, there is a daily reminder of Anderson's longordeal; Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., issues it at eachday's session, placing in the Congressional Record a speech, anarticle or a count of the number of days Anderson has been held.   The State Department repeated its familiar call for release ofthe hostages on Friday, urging those who hold them to immediatelyand unconditionally free all the hostages. ``No political cause canjustify these criminal acts,'' the department said in words usedover and over again during two administrations.   Earlier in the week, the Shiite Moslem extremists who seized andhold Anderson played out their part in the ritual, frustratingevidence of the sameness and futility in it all.   They repeated in the autumn of 1989 the demand with which theybegan in the spring of 1985, for the release of 15 Moslemterrorists imprisoned in Kuwait.   With the demand, once again, came an instant photograph ofAnderson, captive and incommunicado somewhere in the Beirut areasince he was seized by gunmen on March 16, 1985. The photo wassimilar to one released by the captors nearly a year ago.   American officials have said all along that they do not controlthe Kuwaiti prisoners, convicted in 1983 in embassy bombings thatkilled five people, and that they would not make deals withhostage-takers anyhow.   The demand from Islamic Jihad, which also holds hostage ThomasSutherland, 57, came a day after the new president of Iransuggested there might be another way out for the captive Americans,and was read by some diplomats as a militant answer to the messagefrom Tehran.   Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran would try to help get the hostagesfreed if the United States agrees to release Iranian assets frozenin the Teheran embassy hostage crisis of 1979. He said the UnitedStates also should help determine what happened to three Iraniandiplomats kidnapped in southern Lebanon in 1982 and believed to bedead.   Those, too, are familiar demands. And they drew a familiarresponse. Officials at the State Department and the White Housesaid no deals for hostages, and that the United States has no newinformation about the three Iranians. The dispute over frozenassets, money and military equipment, is in the hands of a specialtribunal in The Hague, which periodically releases funds itdetermines are owed Iran.   ``Our position has not changed, that we do not link the Iranianassets to the hostages, and we do not make deals for hostages,''said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.   Eight Americans and 10 other Westerners are held hostage inLebanon, by militant Shiite groups aligned with Iran. But theIranian government always has disclaimed direct knowledge orcontrol of the captives, and Rafsanjani did so again.   Administration officials now believe that the hostage situationwill be resolved only as part of a broader settlement includingsome normalization of relations with Iran. President Bush came tooffice saying he looked to a day of improved U.S. relations withIran, and inviting Teheran to move toward it by helping gainfreedom for the captives.   The policy is unchanged. So is the plight of the hostages _``year after frustrating year,'' as Peggy Say, Anderson's sister,said at the birthday Mass.   ``It is hope that motivates us to approach every ceremony as ifit would be the last,'' said Mrs. Say, a leader among the hostagefamilies.   But there was no one to suggest anything more than hope; no newpolicy, no promise, no sign of movement. Only the ritual farewells,spoken with the suggestion that the next hostage ceremony must, atlast, celebrate freedom instead of marking bondage.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
