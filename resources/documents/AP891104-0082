KROPKO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The novelty of a mayoral campaign between twoblack candidates is being overshadowed by something more familiarto Cleveland voters: rough, tough, hardball politics.   City Council President George Forbes and state Sen. MichaelWhite have pulled no punches in a campaign filled with allegationsof wife beating, strong-arm tactics and name calling. Former MayorDennis Kucinich says that's what Clevelanders expect.   ``Cleveland politics is not high tea,'' said Kucinich, whonarrowly survived a recall attempt during his own tumultuous termas mayor in the 1970s. ``It's a rock 'em, sock 'em, knock-'em-outtype of politics in the finest tradition of America. And if it wasanything different, people here would be bored and wouldn't vote.''   Forbes, president of City Council since 1973, wants voters torecognize his role in the city's recovery from its December 1978default on $14 million in loans to six banks. The default, thefirst by a major American city since the Great Depression, wreakedhavoc on the city's credit rating and its image.   White, a city councilman at the time of the default and a statesenator since 1984, has said he can unify the city, which hasalmost equal numbers of black and white residents.   Those messages, however, have been clouded at times byallegations that White is a slumlord who beat his two previouswives and that Forbes is an old-style city boss who has used publicoffice for personal gain.   The two Democrats emerged from a field of five candidates, theother three of them white, in an Oct. 3 non-partisan primary.Forbes placed first, with 37 percent of the vote; White was secondwith 25 percent.   Since then, a poll by Cleveland's major newspaper, The PlainDealer, showed White leading Forbes by 46 percent to 27 percent.The poll of 802 registered voters was conducted Oct. 16-19 and hada margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.   The winner of Tuesday's general election will become Cleveland'sfirst black mayor since Carl Stokes, now a municipal judge, won theoffice and served as the first black mayor of a large American cityfrom 1967-71.   Mayor George Voinovich, a popular, low-key Republican, isleaving office after three terms to seek the GOP nomination forgovernor.   Forbes, a 59-year-old lawyer, is keenly aware of thesignificance of two black candidates seeking the city's top job.   ``This city has moved forward by leaps and bounds,'' he said ina recent televised debate. ``No one could have even imagined thattwo black men could be running for mayor in a city that is almostdivided equally between black and white.''   White, 38, holder of a master's degree in public administration,has played down the racial significance. He has stressed hiscommitment to unifying the city's primarily black east side andwhite west side, and has depicted the election as a battle betweentwo competing philosophies:   ``One philosophy has sought to lead by divide and conquer, bypitting east against west and black against white. The otherphilosophy is that it is time for us to come together as a city.''   Forbes stresses his close ties with Voinovich over the past 10years. But voters also remember less flattering highlights of thatdecade: Forbes cursing at a reporter who questioned him about adelinquent water bill, or throwing a chair at a city councilman.   ``I have said there have been things I have done that I wish Ihad not done. There have been some things I have said that I wish Ihad not said. I apologize about that,'' he said.   Forbes also has refused to make his income tax filings publicdespite reports linking his law firm to business deals with thecity while he was City Council president. He has denied using hisposition for private gain.   White, who has been married three times, has had to answeraccusations that he beat his first two wives. One report was basedon court documents and the other on remarks by his second wife.   ``Divorce is not a very pretty thing,'' White said. ``There havebeen, quite frankly, times where there have been heated exchanges.I am neither an abuser nor a beater of women. ... I never beat myex-wives.''   Forbes has called White a slumlord, alleging that city housinginspection records show that White owns seven properties thattogether have some 200 code violations. White has said inspectionsof the properties during the mayoral campaign were politicallymotivated.</TEXT></DOC>
