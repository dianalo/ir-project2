Taking on debt to buy back stock still makes sense formature low-debt companies where growth options are limited.&quot;It's better to put money into shareholders' hands forreinvestment in growth companies,&quot; contends David Glassman, apartner in Stern, Stewart andamp; Co., a New York financialconsulting firm.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, mature companies may be rejuvenated bythe discipline of shedding assets and improving productivityto meet debt payments, he says. And interest expense remainstax-deductible, unlike stock dividends.   Mr. Glassman predicts there will be plenty of leveragedbuy-outs and stock buy-backs this decade among supermarket,food, oil and retail companies. But he also expects thecompanies to be more restrained in taking on debt.   Along those lines, Kohlberg, Kravis andamp; Roberts, the largestleveraged buy-out firm, has told its investors that itexpects to see fewer transactions where success is dependenton asset sales. Also, it said its future deals will call forupwards of 25% to 30% of equity to capitalization. That is incontrast to the 1980s when deals were completed for less than10% equity.   Even so, by adding leverage to reduce the number of sharesoutstanding, &quot;debt can be used to turn slow growth equityinto high octane,&quot; Richard Kauffman, a managing director ofFirst Boston Corp., says. Each remaining share stands to getmore income than before as long as debt expenses aren'toverwhelming.   Debt levels can look more onerous than they are, notesMerton Miller, the 1990 Nobel laureate from the GraduateSchool of Business of the University of Chicago. &quot;There'sless leverage than people think because debt to equity bookvalue is more than debt to market value.&quot;   He also believes that markets rather than current fashionshould dictate debt levels. &quot;The markets are self-correctingmechanisms. If corporations are issuing more debt than thepublic wants, rates of interest will change to discourageit,&quot; he argues.   Even Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. says it has less of aknee-jerk reaction to high leverage than before. &quot;The ratingsprocess has developed better tools for analyzing, so there isless emphasis on leverage,&quot; says Solomon Samson, an Sandamp;Pmanaging director. He explains that &quot;if there's a companywith strong cash flow and demonstrable financial liquidity,then we are more forgiving if leverage is higher.&quot;   Buy-out entrepreneur Theodore Forstmann adds the soberingthought that in some situations, &quot;I don't see anything sowonderful about putting equity under a pile of debt.&quot; Mr.Forstmann was one of the few calling for more equity duringthe 1980s.   Now, he says, investors who take some of the riskierleveraged buy-outs public again may simply be helping thecompany buy time. &quot;They'd better read the prospectuses.Equity can be beneficial in some cases, but it's not apanacea for all.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Balancing Acts: A Decade of Debt IsNow Giving Way To the Age of Equity --- Firms Move toDeleverage With New Stock Offerings To Bolster Balance Sheets--- Setting the Stage for Recovery&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 16, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
