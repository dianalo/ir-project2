Business Day of Johannesburg quoted banking and other sources asconfirming the sale by Mobil of about $400 million in assets for$150 million to Trek, the largest privately owned oil company inSouth Africa.   The local financial daily also said the Mobil properties wouldbe sold in separate deals over a period of time.   Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United Statesremained silent about the reports. Jack Lord, spokesman for Mobilat its New York headquarters, said Wednesday the company had nocomment.   ``We'd heard rumors they'd been doing contingency plans forwithdrawal,'' said Diane Bratcher, a spokeswoman for the InterfaithCenter on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based church groupthat pressures American companies to leave South Africa. ``It sortof flies in the face of everything they've been saying.''   News of the possible sale sent Trek shares soaring 15.3 percentfrom Monday to Tuesday on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Trek isa subsidiary of General Mining Union Corp., a South Africa miningconglomerate.   Mobil employs almost 2,800 people in South Africa and has been asymbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country, despitewidespread condemnation of the white-minority government'ssuppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid.   Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170American companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Mosthave sold their operations at low prices to SouthAfrican-controlled business.   Since Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil concern, pulled out ofSouth Africa in 1986, Mobil had insisted it would not bow topressure to disinvest, despite pressure on the company byanti-apartheid groups in the United States.   At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting Mobil to vacateSouth Africa are on the agenda at the company's annual meeting,scheduled for May 11.   The Star of Johannesburg, the nation's largest daily, reportedthat ``industry sources confirmed'' Mobil was selling its SouthAfrican assets for an estimated 500 million rand, roughly $125million.   The Citizen, another Johannesburg daily, quoted ``local andoverseas'' sources as saying that Mobil was consideringdisinvesting. The paper said Mobil is the largest non-South Africancontrolled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline stations, a$225 million investment in an oil refinery, and a distributionnetwork.</TEXT></DOC>
