A newspaper editor was reported detained today under aproclamation allowing detention without trial.   The unions, representing an estimated 60,000 workers, said infull-page newspaper advertisements that the strike will take placeMonday and Tuesday unless their demands are met.   The demands include the release of detainees, withdrawal ofpolice from black townships, and the relocation of security forcebases that are next to schools in the northern war zone.   South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia, was beenadministered by South Africa since World War I. South Africa hasdefied calls by the United Nations to grant independence to theterritory, saying it would consider doing so only after Cubantroops withdraw from neighboring, Marxist-ruled Angola.   Today marked the third anniversary of the installation of amultiracial interim government in Namibia, where blacks make upnearly 90 percent of the 1.3 million population.   The chairman of the transitional Cabinet, Andrew Matjila, saidthe planned general strike and an ongoing classroom boycott by manyblack students were part of a campaign to create insecurity in theterritory.   ``We have no intention of letting events slip out of ourcontrol,'' said Matjila, who is black.   The unions organizing the strike are affiliated with theSouth-West African People's Organization, Namibia's largestindependent movement. It is a legal political organization inNamibia, but its guerrilla wing is outlawed and has waged a bushwar in the north since 1966.</TEXT></DOC>
