French farmers are sabotaging water pumps that supply citydwellers. A two-month heat wave left 38 people dead in Algeria.Half of Italy's olive crop has been destroyed. Residents ofIstanbul, Turkey, are limited to four hours of water a day.   In Greece, the drought is the worst in 100 years, forcing thegovernment to raise water prices 300 percent in an effort to drivedown consumption.   Supertankers are shipping water to hard-hit Greek coastal areasand geologists drilling for fresh supplies. Agriculturalcooperatives say farmers have sustained losses of $2 billion.   The Greek government plans to divert the central Evinos river toreplenish reservoirs around Athens, where the current supply wouldlast only 98 days.   Much of France is suffering a second year of drought. A heatwave last weekend claimed five lives, including a farmer whodropped dead while installing irrigation equipment.   A persistent Atlantic high-pressure system has held rainfall inNormandy and the entire southern third of the country to 50 percentbelow average. Dozens of towns have banned lawn-watering andcar-washing.   ``In the regions of France where it's dry, it's the driest for10 years,'' meteorologist Guy La Riviere of the National WeatherService said Friday.   Officials in the southwestern Aude region, where rationing hasbeen in effect since 1989, reported anxious farmers were illegallydiverting water to save corn and sunflower crops.   Farmers occasionally sabotage public water pumps they considerto be stealing water from their sun-baked fields, officials say.   ``The acts become more dramatic as the situation gets moreurgent,'' said Jean-Pierre Monod, president of a farmingcooperative.   Lack of rain has left major rivers like the Loire, Rhone andGaronne at half their normal levels. When temperatures in theGaronne climbed to 82 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, the Goflechnuclear power plant shut down because the river water was too hotto cool the reactor.   Across the Mediterranean in Algeria, a two-month heat wave hasbeen blamed for 38 deaths in the southern city of Ain Salah.Temperatures consistently hovered at 104 degrees.   In Algiers, residents stockpiled water and braced for agovernment-ordered suspension of supplies Sunday and Monday. Waterreserves have dropped by two-thirds in the capital the past twoyears.   In Italy, rainfall so far this year has been nearly 40 percentbelow average, said Lt. Col. Paolo Ernani of the Weather Bureau.   More than half the olive harvest has been destroyed and thedrought will seriously affect production for next year's crop,according the main consortium of Italian olive oil producers.   The island of Sardinia has asked the government to declare astate of emergency. The boot-heel region of Puglia has alreadyreceived such designation, along with $400,000 in aid.   In Turkey, two years of drought have parched most coastal andinland regions except along the Black Sea in the north, waterworksand meteorology officials said.   In some quarters of Istanbul, the only water available forwashing is in public baths, and drinking supplies are limited tofour hours per day.   In Portugal, hot, dry conditions caused the number of forestfires between June 15 and July 23 to increase by one-fourth overthe same period last year, said National Fire Service ChiefCristiano Santos.   Fires also destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest andbrush in eastern, southern and northwestern Spain, southern France,and parts of Italy.   One blaze on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius has raged sinceMonday, and a wildfire burned out of control Friday on the Greekisland of Samos.</TEXT></DOC>
