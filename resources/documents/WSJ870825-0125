Otherwise, it may take three weeks to get a document finished by the lab's regular typists.    --Guard your office furnishings. If your desk lamp is stolen -- as his was, despite the lab's guards and barbed-wire fence -- it takes four weeks to get another.    --Avoid collaborating with outside scientists. Arranging payment for them takes about 20 signatures and six months of paperwork.    &quot;Over here,&quot; says the frustrated Mr. Sieber, &quot;a year is like nothing.&quot;    Such is the paper-clogged life of a scientist at the Common Market's Ispra laboratory, a bureaucratic beehive of 1,556 drones near northern Italy's big, blue Lake Maggiore. Its scientists are among the highest paid in Europe, but critics call their work irrelevant and their skills inadequate. &quot;We are strongly of the opinion that standards are lower than desirable&quot; among the lab staff, concluded a panel of European industrial scientists which audited Ispra last year.    Ispra is what happens when science meets politics, European Community-style. The lab was opened 27 years ago as the infant Common Market's center for nuclear-energy research. Almost immediately, its political masters at EC headquarters in Brussels began quarreling over policy. Ever since, shifting political winds in Brussels have blown the lab from one unfinished research project to another, its mission changing and its fate uncertain.    In the turmoil, scientific output suffers. Bureaucracy and inefficiency flourish. Ispra's scientists, says Harry Beckers, research director of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and head of the EC audit panel, are &quot;slaves to a bureaucratic system.&quot;    The EC Commission spends more than $1 billion a year on science and technology, supplementing the billions spent nationally by the EC's 12 member-governments. But whereas most Brussels science programs subsidize corporate and university research, Ispra is special in being the biggest of four laboratories owned, funded and managed entirely by the EC's corps of bureaucrats. As such, it is most exposed to the extraordinary political infighting and red tape that often characterize this uniquely European governmental body.    The lab's problems stem from &quot;the lack of steady, continuous good scientific management&quot; in Brussels, complains Leon van Hove, a prominent nuclear physicist who was chairman of an Ispra supervisory committee until he quit last year in frustration. Though praising much of the lab's work, Mr. van Hove accuses EC managers of flitting &quot;from short-range decision to short-range decision&quot; based on whatever political deals the 12 EC member-states happen to cut.    Next month, the politicians go at it again, as they begin debating a proposed EC Commission reform package. Commission officials, acknowleding inefficiencies, promise to streamline the lab bureaucracy. But George Bishop, the lab's director, defends Ispra's research as already of high quality. He says the lab tracked last year's Chernobyl radiation cloud over Italy, devised dozens of nuclear-safety codes used in European reactors and made important discoveries toward a next-generation nuclear fusion reactor. Despite frequent, &quot;upsetting&quot; policy changes in Brussels, he says, &quot;we've always been determined enough to carry on to achieve good results.&quot;    Under the circumstances, that's a minor miracle.    A visitor arriving at the sunny, verdant complex down the road from the lakeside village of Ispra is given two maps: one to the center's 150-odd buildings, the other to its bureaucracy -- an &quot;organigramme&quot; showing the relationship of the lab's 45 different administrative units. Not shown are the 23 visiting committees of politicians, bureaucrats and scientists created by the EC to supervise the lab's work. Counting all committee members, that's nearly three overseers for each Ispra scientist.    &quot;Committees here are like hydras: You kill one and two sprout in its place,&quot; says Giuseppe Volta, head of the lab's computer-systems engineering division. (Indeed, the EC Commission's reforms would disband one supervisory committee -- and create six new ones.)    Now white-haired, Mr. Volta arrived at Ispra in 1963 - a young scientist who saw the new lab as a step toward European unity and an end to European wars. Ispra was created under an early EC treaty establishing the six-nation Euratom nuclear-research consortium. It was to make Europe's fledgling nuclear program self-sufficient from U.S. technology. Though its scientists spoke a Babel of languages, they sent their children to the same multilingual school and attended the same ecumenical church.    The honeymoon soon ended. Because France and Germany, competing to sell nuclear plants, wouldn't trust commercially valuable research to a cooperative laboratory, the EC killed Ispra's biggest reactor-research project in 1969. But closing the lab outright was -- and remains -- politically unthinkable. Italy supports it as a local employer, and small EC countries back it to avoid building big nuclear labs of their own. France, Germany and Britain generally go along to win small-country support for their pet programs.    That means much of the past 18 years has been spent devising politically acceptable busy-work for Ispra. After the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in the U.S., the lab proposed a new, $330 million reactor-safety study. Brussels debated the project for two years before authorizing it and -- after another two years -- canceling it as out-of-date and too costly. To appease Italy, the other EC countries agreed to find substitute projects for Ispra. One, a study of a potential material for use in fusion-reactors, was delayed two years by more wrangling in Brussels. Now, with the study just beginning, some scientists question whether it, too, is out-of-date.    &quot;This place,&quot; observes Mr. Volta, &quot;is full of unfinished projects.&quot;    The program changes have left some Ispra scientists out of their league. Nuclear specialists were reassigned to study water pollution or interpret satellite data. Their output is meager. On average, each Ispra scientist gets about one patent every 14 years and publishes one scientific article every other year.    But they cash big pay checks. Thanks to the EC's generous pay system, a typical Ispra scientist earns the equivalent of $61,000 after taxes each year. That's nearly what an experienced nuclear physicist earns before taxes in U.S. industry. By European standards, it's a fortune: A comparable British government scientist takes home $24,000.    That brings another problem: hardly anybody leaves Ispra voluntarily. More than half the staff arrived during the center's first few years. The average age is 50. Wrote one EC auditor in 1982: &quot;A situation where almost half the scientific and technical staff are at the end of their career, without a reasonable hope of promotion, is clearly very unhealthy and can . . . lead to a growing lack of drive.&quot;    Certainly there isn't any lack of complaining. Inside the guarded lab gates one recent morning, two disgruntled lab workers thrust leaflets into the hands of arriving employees. They proclaim &quot;a general assembly of personnel&quot; for that afternoon, to protest the budget bickering in Brussels.    In one of their numerous strikes over the years, the Ispra unions locked top lab administrators out of the complex for several days. Another time, six scientists went on a publicized hunger strike. Nowadays, the aging workers just talk rather than strike. Union officials grumble darkly of rumored plans in Brussels to kill particular projects, or allege conspiracies to try shutting the lab entirely.    Outside a lab nuclear reactor -- now idle because of an earlier project-cancellation -- a brick shrine to the Virgin Mary has been built in the parking lot. The Italian inscription reads:    &quot;Ave Maria, protectress of the mountains: Help those who work here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
