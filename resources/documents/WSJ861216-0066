President Reagan will decide whether to accept or revise the panel's recommendations, and any salary increases would be included in the budget the administration will send to Congress next month.    The Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries recommended boosting the salaries for members of Congress to $135,000 from the $77,400 they will receive after a scheduled increase of about 3% next month. For cabinet members, the panel recommended that salaries rise to $160,000 a year from the $88,800 they will receive after next month's increase. And district court judges' annual pay would increase to $130,000 from $81,100.    The commission's report noted that the 3,037 top officials who would receive the pay raises have received only infrequent cost-of-living adjustments since 1977. The report also says that the officials' purchasing power has declined 40% since 1969.    If the president recommends salary increases, they will take effect within 30 days unless both houses of Congress pass a bill of disapproval and send it to Mr. Reagan for his signature.    The panel, which was headed by James Ferguson, chairman and chief executive officer of General Foods Corp., argued that the relatively low salaries for top government jobs make it difficult to attract and retain the best people.    The commission noted that the average deputy counsel in a corporate legal department makes 25% more than the chief justice of the Supreme Court. The commission suggested increasing the chief justice's salary to $175,000 a year from the $111,700 level it will reach in January. Supreme Court associate justices would earn $165,000 a year if the recommendations are adopted, compared with the $107,200 they will receive after next month's increase.    The report also noted that resignations of federal judges are at their highest level in the nation's history. &quot;One insurmountable problem is the cost of sending children to college,&quot; a fact sheet acompanying the report said. &quot;People just can't afford it.&quot;    The commission's proposals also included a provision that would curb some congressmen's income. It recommended that if substantial salary increases are adopted, the government should limit or end the current system that permits senators and representatives to supplement their incomes with fees from speaking engagements.    The panel's recommendations came under sharp criticism from consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who vowed to mobilize public opposition to the raises. He called complaints about the cost of college tuition &quot;crocodile tears,&quot; and said the report was written by and for elitists.    Mr. Nader asked the president to reject the panel's recommendations, and urged citizens to write and to call their congressmen, opposing the &quot;great congressional salary grab.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
