<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0201 </DOCNO><TEXT>A low cost Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) data processing system for IBM compatible personal computers isdescribed. The system has been designed to interface with most computercontrolled electron spectrometers. The data system is based on a largesoftware package named PC_ACSES (Personal Computer Analysis Code forScanning Electron Spectrometers). This software utilizes a mouse driveninterface and provides the user with a wide range of easily accessibledata processing options. Features of the system include data manipulation,manual and automatic quantification, flexible annotation and high qualityplotter output. In addition, the system can incorporate a 512 x 512 imageframestore and powerful digital image processing routines. The imageprocessing capabilities of PC_ACSES allow the user to optimize both secondaryelectron (SEM) and elemental images, add color to images with histogrampainting, create customized pseudo-color image overlays, and annotateimages with variable size fonts and micron markers. This PC (personalcomputer) based data processing system provides a low cost alternativeto high-end commercial systems by combining inexpensive computer hardwarewith advanced software. 6 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
