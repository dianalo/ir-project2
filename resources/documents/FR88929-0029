Background</ITAG>The DoD FAR Supplement is codified in Chapter 2, Title 48 of the Code ofFederal Regulations.The October 1, 1987 revision of the CFR is the most recent edition of thattitle. It reflects amendments to the 1986 edition of the DoD FAR Supplementmade by Defense Acquisition Circulars 86-1 through 85-5.Interested parties may submit proposed revisions to this Supplement directlyto the DAR Council.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Public Comments</ITAG>Notices of proposed rules were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>requesting Government agencies, private firms,associations, and the general public to submit comments to be consideredin the formulation of the final rules.DAC 86-11, Items I, II, and IIIPublic comments were not solicited with respect to these items becausethey provide informational material.DAC 86-11, Items IV Through VIIPublic comments were not solicited with respect to these revisions sincesuch revisions do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage inthe DFARS having a significant impact on contractors or offerors, or donot have a significant effect beyond agency internal operating procedures;or compelling reasons required issuance of an interim rule without priorpublication for public comment. However, comments from small entities concerningthe affected DoD FAR Supplement coverage will be considered. Please citeDAR Case 88-610D.DAC 86-11, Item VIIIPublic comments were not solicited with respect to this item because itcontains a reprint of international agreements between the United Statesand foreign countries.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>DAC 86-11, Items I, II, and IIIThese items contain informational material; therefore the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) does not apply.DAC 86-11, Items IV, V, and VIIThese revisions are not ``significant revisions'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., they do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theDFARS having a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations, solicitation of agency and public views on theserevisions is not required. Since such solicitation is not required, theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) does not apply.DAC 86-11, Item VIThese changes implement section 8054 of the Department of Defense AppropriationsAct, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202) and section 124 of the National Defense AuthorizationAct for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 (Pub. L. 100-180). There are no knownsmall entities who manufacture aircraft ejection seats, and therefore thischange is not expected to impact small entities. There is only one knowndomestic supplier of the chemical weapons antidote described, and thisprovision will not have a negative impact on that organization. However,comments from small entities concerning the affected DoD FAR Supplementcoverage will be considered. Please cite DAR Case 88-610D.DAC 86-11, Item VIIIThis item contains a reprint of international agreements between the UnitedStates and foreign countries.

Such compensation is generally allowable,provided (1) it is for work performed in the current year and does notrepresent a retroactive adjustment of prior years' salaries or wages, (2)it is reasonable for the work performed, (3) it is based on and conformsto the terms and conditions of an established compensation plan or practicefollowed so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make thepayment, (4) when existing compensation plans are revised or new plansare implemented, the Government, either before implementation or withina reasonable period thereafter, has an opportunity to review the allowabilityof the changes; otherwise no presumption of allowability will exist, and(5) the costs are not unallowable under other paragraphs of Part 2. Reasonablenessis generally determined by comparison with other firms of the same size,in the same industry, or in the same geographic areas, performing similarservices or work. Costs of compensation are not allowable to the extentthat they result from provisions of labor management agreements that, asapplied to work in the performance of Government contracts, are determinedto be unreasonable either because they are unwarranted by the characterand circumstances of the work or because they are discriminatory againstthe Government. Specific coverage is also included for bonuses and incentivecompensation, severance pay, stock options, and pension costs.

Normal depreciation on a contractor's plant, equipmentand other capital facilities is an allowable element of contract cost providedsuch costs are reasonable and allocable. Depreciation will ordinarily beconsidered reasonable if the contractor follows depreciation policies andprocedures which (1) are consistent with policies and procedures followedin non-Government business, (2) are reflected in books of accounts andfinancial statements, and (3) are used and are acceptable for Federal incometax purposes.

I would be grateful if you would arrange to have one ofthe originals signed on behalf of the Government of Sweden and returnedto me.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is my earnest desire that this agreement prove useful and to ourmutual benefit in opening the way to reciprocal opportunities in defensetrade.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">___</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Ambassador Ulf Dinkelspiel,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Stockholm, Sweden</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Ulf: Before our two governments enter into the Memorandum ofUnderstanding ``Relating to the Principles Governing Mutual Cooperationin the Defense Procurement Area'', I believe it advisable to clarify thepurpose of certain language in the MOU.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, you will note that the Preamble to the MOU states it to beour intention to ``assure a long-term and equitable balance in reciprocalpurchasing of defense equipment.'' Moreover, Article I, Paragraph 1, ofthe MOU also states that ``Both Governments intend to achieve and maintaina long-term equitable balance in their exchanges of defense equipment.. . .'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This language is employed solely for the purpose of enabling the Departmentof Defense (DOD) to waive Congressionally-imposed restrictions againstprocurement of foreign specialty metals, in the interest of fulfillingthe intent of the MOU. The prohibition in question is currently found inSection 9011 of the Continuing Resolution on Appropriations, 1987, whichprovides, <T3>inter alia,</T3> that ``No part of any appropriation contained in thisAct . . . shall be available for the procurement of . . . specialty metals. . .'' The same section, however, contains a proviso ``that nothing hereinshall preclude the procurement of specialty metals . . . when such procurementis necessary to comply with agreements with foreign governments requiringthe United States to purchase supplies from foreign sources for the purposesof offsetting sales made by the United States Government or United Statesfirms under approved programs serving defense requirements. . . .''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The language of the MOU quoted in the second paragraph above, takenin the context of the MOU as a whole, is employed for the purpose of makingit possible for DOD to waive restrictions which would otherwise hinderthe implementation of the MOU. With reference to the language quoted, however,the reference to ``long-term equitable balance'' does not mean it to beour purpose to assure that a purchase by one must be balanced by a purchaseby the other of equivalent value. Nor does it mean that the cumulativevalue of purchases on one side will necessarily equal the cumulative valueof purchases on the other. Rather, the MOU seeks to assure that each sideremoves barriers to reciprocal defense trade on a fair and equitable basis.Thus no commitment on the part of the United States to establish any particularratio in defense trade is intended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, with reference to Article I, Paragraph 5, of the MOU, theprovision for waiving customs duties is intended to be reciprocal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If your understanding of these two points regarding the MOU is inagreement with mine, please inform me so our letters may be attached tothe Memorandum of Understanding as an appendix.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sincerely yours,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard Perle.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">Stockholm, February 3, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">The Honorable Richard Perle, Assistant Secretary of Defense, Departmentof Defense, Washington, D.C. 20301 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Richard: I refer to your letter of January 16, 1987 concerningour discussion on a Memorandum of Understanding ``Relating to the PrinciplesGoverning Mutual Cooperation in the Defense Procurement Area''. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I wish to confirm that I am in full agreement with the contents ofyour letter. Thus I quite agree that the reference to ``long-term equitybalance'' in the present text of the MoU is not to be seen as an assurancethat a purchase by one must be balanced by a purchase by the other of equitablevalue, but rather that the MoU seeks to assure that each side removes barriersto reciprocal defense trade on a fair and equitable basis. I also agreethat the provision for waiving customs duties in Article I, Paragraph 5,of the MoU is intended to be reciprocal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I share your view that our letters should be attached to the Memorandumof Understanding as an appendix.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sincerely yours,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ulf Dinkelspiel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-22069 Filed 9-28-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3810-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
