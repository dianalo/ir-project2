Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/23/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)</GV><LP>   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- If there was any doubt in theminds of Americans or Iraqis, President Bush's mobilizationof military reserves ought to eliminate it: The U.S. isprepared to fight, not just to posture, in the Persian Gulf.   Mr. Bush's decision yesterday to activate thousands ofreservists has military importance, of course. The U.S., inthe post-Vietnam era, has structured its armed forces to relymore than ever on citizen-soldiers, who perform some of themore obscure but important technical tasks needed to givesupport to large-scale fighting units.</LP><TEXT>   But the move is more important for the psychologicalimpact it is likely to have, particularly on the Americanpublic. As doctors, lawyers and mechanics from towns andcities across America vacate their jobs to go into activeservice, Americans who may have been considering war in theMiddle East a hypothetical idea will get a clear message thatit is a real possibility -- and one that could affect themdirectly.   &quot;The message in calling up the reserves is, `We're playingfor real,'&quot; says pollster Peter Hart. &quot;It's one thing whenisolated events are going on in another part of the world,but this absolutely will bring it home much more.&quot;   Adds retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, a former chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff: &quot;It has an impact on the communitywhen people see that a fellow they know at the bank is nolonger there.&quot;   And that raises the political stakes for Mr. Bush, who isordering the first activation of reservists in a militarycrisis since the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam. (Reservistsand National Guardsmen also were called up to serve as postalworkers during a 1970 postal strike.) Mr. Bush is likely toenjoy at least a brief, rally-around-the-flag surge ofsupport as he calls on American citizens to help protectAmerican interests in the Persian Gulf.   The rise of patriotic sentiment may even help quell anycomplaints about the Middle East mission in Congress, where,after all, 13 members are themselves members of the reservesor the National Guard. &quot;It makes it much tougher to quibbleor natter at a president who shows his will and hisresources,&quot; says James Cannon, who was an aide in the FordWhite House and later a Senate staffer.   But the political risks are enormous over the long haul.If fighting breaks out and reservists become casualties, theimpact will hit even closer to home than if full-timesoldiers alone were involved.   &quot;I think the call-up further engenders support for thepresident's actions,&quot; says retired Rear Admiral Gene LaRocque, a former commander of the USS Saratoga. &quot;But as soonas the shooting starts, the bottom for the support is goingto fall out.&quot;   The reserve mobilization may also send a chilling signalthat this will be no quick strike, as the U.S. has latelyconducted against Panama, Grenada and Libya. &quot;It raises thequestion if this might not be a long-term commitment,&quot; sayspollster Stanley Greenberg, &quot;and there is no doubt that anysign that this is going to be protracted will produce a lotof anxiety.&quot;   And even if the standoff with Iraq drags on withoutfighting, &quot;this goes from a positive to a negative,&quot; saysDavid Keene, a conservative political activist. &quot;People willwant to bring (the reservists) home. And our coalition withour allies will fall apart. People will want to know, whyaren't regulars from Europe there? Why these reservists?&quot;   The reserve activation came as President Bush appeared toback down slightly on one front of his confrontation withIraqi ruler Saddam Hussein, which has been building sinceIraqi soldiers overran Kuwait Aug. 2. Mr. Bush told reportersthat he may be prepared to wait a few days before orderingU.S. ships to stop more tankers and freighters carrying Iraqigoods, giving the United Nations time to enact a resolutionexplicitly authorizing military action to enforce theinternational trade sanctions imposed on Iraq. The SovietUnion is urging the U.S. to give the U.N. more time toauthorize a naval blockade, Mr. Bush implied.   At the same time, Jordan's King Hussein announced that heis heading to Iraq to attempt a peace-making diplomaticmission. But American officials are growing increasinglyworried that a flashpoint in the tense standoff could bereached on Friday, when Iraq has ordered foreign embassies inoccupied Kuwait to close down. The U.S. and other Westernnations intend to defy the order.   The impact of the call-up will be greatly influenced byhow big it becomes. Neither President Bush nor DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney will say precisely how many reservistswill be activated, and other aides say the administrationwill remain vague abut the numbers to give the president moreflexibility to call up even more people as time goes.   But the administration insists the number of reservistsactivated won't approach the 200,000 Mr. Bush is authorizedto activate for 180 days without congressional approval.Initially, a call-up of 40,000 is more likely. The WhiteHouse says that those called will be people with specializedskills needed in the massive movement of troops to SaudiArabia, such as food and water handlers, doctors and nurses,construction specialists and cargo handlers.   &quot;Selected units will be called up as they are needed andwhen they are needed,&quot; says Gen. Colin Powell, chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.   For the time being, economists don't expect anysignificant economic effect. Even if the president activated100,000 reservists, &quot;you're talking about less than one-tenthof one percent of the labor force,&quot; says Lawrence Chimerine,a fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.&quot;There are others there to take their place.&quot;   As the tension continues, Mr. Bush's decision to turn tomilitary reservists means he has decided to employ a militarytool that recent presidents have been reluctant to use.Politicians like to keep the pain of war as far removed fromthe general populace as possible, so the reserves often havebeen kept at arm's length.   In Vietnam, for instance, rather than call on reservists,the Pentagon used draftees to fill out empty units eventhough those specialties already existed in the guard and thereserves.   In fact, in recent decades the reserves have been calledon more often to intervene in American domestic disputes thanforeign hostilities. President Kennedy called on the reservesand National Guard three times to quell civil-rightstensions, in addition to activating them during the BerlinWall and Cuban missile crises. And President Johnson usedreservists once during civil-rights disturbances.   A small National Guard unit from Missouri consisting ofabout 40 soldiers was undergoing routine training during theinvasion of Panama and was pressed into service there --guarding a prisoner of war compound. But in general, the lasttime the country relied heavily on the reserves in a conflictwas when President Truman called up hundreds of thousandsduring the Korean War.   Today, because of changes in the American militarystructure, it would be nearly impossible to maintain the kindof big and far-flung military operation the U.S. is mountingin the Persian Gulf without some help from the reserves.   After the abolition of the draft in 1973, the Pentagonswitched to what it calls a &quot;Total Force Policy&quot; that reliesmore on part-time soldiers. Under this system, many supportjobs essential in wartime were turned over in large part tothe reserves.   In endorsing this policy in the 1970s, Congress hadpolitics as well as military efficiency in mind. Lawmakersfigured that if a president were forced in a time ofhostilities to turn quickly to the use of reserves, he wouldhave to find out early whether a conflict had widespreadpopular support. Use of reservists and National Guardsmen,lawmakers calculated, would reduce the chances of anotherVietnam War.   So now, 98% of the army's lawyers are reservists. Some ofthem may be called on to handle the legal technicalities ofcalling on other reservists. Adm. Moorer says Pentagonacquaintances have told him that &quot;they've called inreservists to work on procedures to call up otherreservists.&quot;   In addition, 87% of the army's psychological-warfarespecialists and many of its hospital units are in thereserves. And, particularly important in a showdown with Iraqand its chemical-weapons capability, 66% of the army'schemical-warfare and related specialists are in the reserves.   And some military specialists think that the Pentagon mayalso need technicians who work with weapons. On aircraftcarriers, for instance, pilots make practice runs using liveammunition only once a year, Adm. Moorer says. In actualconflict those pilots might make two bombing runs a day,vastly increasing the need for support people to handle bombsand fuzes. In the U.S., reservists can replace weaponsspecialists stationed here to free them to go oversees, orthe reservists might be sent directly to the Persian Gulf.   For now, the administration officials insist that theyhaven't decided specifically which of these kinds ofspecialists will be called upon, or which proportion willfill in at U.S. bases as opposed to going overseas. Mr.Cheney says that he will get recommendations today from themilitary services on how many and what kind of reserviststhey want to call.   Administration aides say the call-up is likely to involvealmost entirely the military reserves, though they also saythat some National Guard troops could be called in to fillholes. In fact, some Air National Guard planes and crewsalready have been up in the air to help in the airlift toSaudi Arabia, having volunteered with their governors'permission to fly cargo and supplying in-flight refueling forregular forces heading for Saudi Arabia.   Whatever the precise size of the call-up, it seems likelyto reach only a small fraction of America's enormous reserveforces. The overall &quot;Ready Reserve&quot; totals some 580,000troops -- 310,000 Army reservists, 81,000 Air Force, 147,000Navy and 44,000 Marines.   The Army National Guard has another 550,000 soldiers, andthe Air National Guard 112,000.   It's always been particularly dicey to commit Guard unitsto combat. Units tend to be filled with young men and womenfrom the same communities. If one of these units were wipedout, an entire community would suffer. Besides, thoughguardsmen vehemently disagree, Pentagon professionals oftenconsider Guard units to be less primed than regular units.   For now, Americans clearly support the turn to thereservists. In this week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News newspoll, 79% of the public backed calling up National Guardreserves and only 17% opposed it. This support was pervasiveacross all regional, political and generational lines. Forexample, voters between the ages of 18 and 34 -- those mostaffected by a call-up -- supported calling up reserves by a76%-to-21% margin.   And there was immediate congressional support as well.&quot;This is a very capable force and should be used in theemergency in the Middle East,&quot; said Rep. G.V. (Sonny)Montgomery, a Mississippi Democrat who is a senior member ofthe House Armed Services Committee and a retired majorgeneral in the National Guard. Rep. Montgomery, a closefriend of President Bush, wrote to the president last week tourge the action.   &quot;Congress has been pushing for a number of years tobuild-up the National Guard and Reserve,&quot; Rep. Montgomerysaid in a statement. &quot;We have given them first-line equipmentand training. They are ready to respond to this challenge.&quot;   Those sentiments were echoed by another influentialDemocrat, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunnof Georgia. He was the principal author of the 1976 law thatallows the president to call up reservists.   &quot;My intent was to deal with the type of situation we havein the Persian Gulf, where reservists are needed for alimited period and can be activated without a formaldeclaration of war or national emergency,&quot; Sen. Nunn said ina statement.   Because of the political risks involved, White House aidesdon't want the reserve call-up to grow too large. They'veplayed down suggestions from Pentagon officials that thecall-up may approach the 200,000 allowed under the law. WhiteHouse chief of staff John Sununu has pointedly said that thecall-up would be &quot;surgical&quot; and &quot;fine-tuned.&quot;   But psychologically, the call-up is likely to have animpact on Main Street whatever its precise size -- and thatmay actually suit the administration's purposes. &quot;In theshort term calling up the reserves underscores theseriousness of the crisis,&quot; says Mr. Keene, the Republicanconservative activist. &quot;And I presume this is what Bush istrying to do.&quot;   ---   Bob Davis, James M.
