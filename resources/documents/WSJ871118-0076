Kennedy International Airport is practically deserted -- except for the cargo department of Korean Air.    As a jumbo jet arrives from Seoul, the ground crew rolls out an arsenal of unloading equipment. The plane has crossed the Pacific without a single paying passenger but with 237,130 pounds of cargo instead. Buzzers blare and forklifts groan in the midnight rain, as workmen start plucking microwave ovens, cameras and hundreds of other products from the belly of the plane.    This is the U.S. trade deficit in the making. Like the national debt as a whole, America's trade gap has grown so huge it is hard to grasp. For the record, the trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, to $14.08 billion. That was welcomed as good news when it was announced last week, but imports still are running more than $160 billion a year ahead of exports.    On the tarmac, it is easier to comprehend the vastness of America's appetite for foreign goods. At Kennedy Airport, 125 overseas flights a day bring in everything from Italian sports cars to Indian textiles. Economists and policy makers may quarrel about how to fix the U.S. trade deficit or how much of a problem it is. But while they dither, America is importing like never before.    Of course, a single airport -- even one that handles 11% of all dutiable goods brought in by land, air or sea, as Kennedy does -- can't show the entire U.S. trade picture. Big imports such as oil and steel don't show up here, for example.    But the airport workers who handle imports all day have a clear sense of how dependent U.S. consumers and business are on overseas goods. The dollar's latest declines seem to matter only on the margin, making some foreign luxury products too expensive. Much of the rest of the trade deficit looks as if it could persist at almost any exchange rate.    &quot;You'd be surprised at what's imported,&quot; says Lawrence Rosenzweig, a customs official, as he picks up a sheaf of folders. At the top of his stack are documents for aerosol valve parts from West Germany. A little farther down is the paper work for a shipment of Brazilian leather belts. After that comes a filing for $54,000 of what a Hong Kong exporter has described as &quot;designer telephone&quot; accessories.    At Kennedy, all the shipments seem to be urgent. With overseas freight rates as low as $1 a pound, air cargo no longer is limited to exotic, high-priced products. Much of the freight is ordinary manufactured goods. &quot;To some people, even clothing is a perishable item,&quot; says Mr. Rosenzweig. So as fashions change, exporters fly in the blouses, jackets or shirts that they figure Americans will buy.    The huge U.S. trade imbalance troubles some people. Bruno Sabbatini, the New York cargo manager for Italy's Alitalia airline, says the U.S. &quot;is a country that can do anything if it sets its mind to it, but something needs to be done to wake people up about the problem.&quot;    Back when trade was fairly balanced in the 1970s, Mr. Sabbatini divided his warehouse shelves 50-50 between imports and exports. These days, however, Italy sends over so many goods that imports crowd into what once was export space. Among the recent arrivals are three shiny Lamborghini sports cars, which sit on blocks at the back of the warehouse.    &quot;It costs about $3,000 or $4,000 to fly the cars over,&quot; says Mr. Sabbatini. &quot;But when you're paying $100,000 for the car, maybe that isn't a lot of money.&quot;    Price hardly seems to matter for Japanese and West German goods, either. Those nations' currencies have climbed more than 50% against the dollar the past two years, but that has barely dented U.S.-bound shipments for Japan Air Lines and West Germany's Lufthansa. &quot;It's amazing to me, but imports have stayed strong even with the dollar so weak,&quot; says Peter Hees, Lufthansa's New York cargo chief.    Taking a visitor through his giant warehouse, Mr. Hees walks past a freight box that may hold part of the answer. In bold letters, the German label reads: &quot;Originale Teile. Gepruefte Qualitaet.&quot; Original Parts. Proven Quality.    At Japan Air Lines, freight manager Michio Uchida talks at length about how the strong yen has hurt Japanese exporters. But he concedes, &quot;With desperate efforts, they are surviving.&quot;    Mr. Uchida has a gift for understatement. Crates of Japanese goods are stacked more than 20 feet high in the JAL warehouse. There are film, specialty chemicals, lathe parts and even spare parts for Toyotas. As fast as U.S. trucks can arrive each day to spread these imports throughout the East Coast, JAL's 10 weekly cargo flights dump 1,000 more tons of freight into the warehouse each week.    Elsewhere, because Indian textile shipments have become so huge, six customs officials do nothing but process rayon goods from India. (Another team does Indian cotton.) In the cramped quarters of the rayon crew, the second-floor window is partly blocked by a basket of more than 100 unprocessed shipment folders.    For optimists, Kennedy holds some signs that the weak dollar is easing the U.S. trade imbalance a little. JAL says it is flying more U.S. cigarettes to Japan, for instance. And George Fellouris, an import broker at Kennedy Airport, says clients such as Tiffany andamp; Co. are ordering less Italian jewelry, &quot;especially after the stock-market crash.&quot;    At a passenger arrival counter, customs agent William Kuntz adds that &quot;a lot of people are coming back from Europe without buying anything, because they say everything is too expensive.&quot;    But across the tarmac, Korean Air's bustling warehouse tells another story. Much U.S. trade is with developing or newly industrialized nations that don't have very strong currencies, either. No matter how much the dollar falls against the German mark or the Japanese yen, it won't make the U.S. much more competitive against the Brazilian cruzado or even the Korean won.    Korean Air had its busiest month ever in October, importing and exporting 4,981 tons of freight at New York's Kennedy airport. The airline currently has seven jumbo cargo flights into New York each week, up from six a week last year. &quot;We'd like to buy more freight planes,&quot; says O.B. Park, Korean Air's cargo manager. &quot;But none of the other airlines wants to sell us one,&quot; and delivery times for new planes are too long.    After Korean Air's flight from Seoul arrives this night with 99.6% of its allowable cargo weight, a huge crate of women's clothes is packed so tight that it jams on an unloading roller. Mr. Park has an idea. He slides another crate behind the clothes and uses it as a battering ram.    &quot;I think this load is electronic circuit boards,&quot; Mr. Park yells as three men began pushing on the rear crate. The circuit boards survive the shaking, and the improvised remedy works. Two minutes later, both crates roll into the warehouse.    At 2:30 a.m., the plane heads home for Korea, nearly empty. This was a Monday, &quot;an especially bad day&quot; for trade imbalances, Mr. Park asserts. American factories take the weekend off, Mr. Park explains, so their early-week exports are minimal. By contrast, Korean factories work Saturdays and some Sundays, producing reams of exports to the U.S.    Still, the empty-plane syndrome is common on Asian return flights, and some enterprising Irish have found a way to exploit it. The Irish airline, Aer Lingus, flies refrigerated cargoes of fish to New York. These fish, not for American palates, are quickly loaded onto Japan Air Lines cargo planes -- and flown on to Tokyo.    &quot;I know it sounds like a roundabout route,&quot; says Tom Cooney, an Aer Lingus official. But westbound cargo rates for Japan Air Lines are dirt-cheap, because so few goods go from the U.S. to Japan. And the Irish shippers have realized another trend in world trade: European exports to Japan have increased much faster than U.S. ones.    Aer Lingus could save 5,000 miles by routing the fish through London or Frankfurt, Mr. Cooney says. But it doesn't do so, because the fish might spoil while waiting for a free plane. Most of the European cargo jets flying into Tokyo &quot;are pretty full,&quot; Mr. Cooney reports.    (Revised WSJ Nov. 24, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
