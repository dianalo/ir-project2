The Miami-based unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston, is planning to sell $200 million in secured debt to private investors to help it fly through a strike. Eastern also is arranging to sell aircraft, and perhaps other assets, and then lease them back, generating between $150 million and $200 million in additional cash, according to investment bankers and others close to the company.    As part of the fund-raising effort, Texas Air and Eastern have briefed Wall Street analysts on the extent of their readiness for a strike -- including Eastern's moves to line up twice as many contractors in some cases than are needed to replace striking workers. In the worst case, Eastern believes it could be flying at full strength within one week of a machinists' strike.    &quot;I was totally impressed with their coverage,&quot; said a former airline-industry executive who helped American Airlines prepare for a strike and who is familiar with Eastern's plans.    An Eastern official said the extent of the company's preparations aren't unusual. &quot;If you don't have backup for contractors, then you are totally vulnerable in some situations,&quot; he explained. &quot;You err on the side of having too much capability instead of too little capability.&quot;    Although both sides say they are intent on avoiding a strike, Eastern has been locked in high-stakes mediation talks since December with its union representing machinists and ramp workers. Eastern's labor costs, as a percentage of its total costs, are the fourth lowest among the nation's 10 major airlines. But the loss-plagued carrier says it can't survive without steep wage cuts from all employees, particularly from the baggage handlers, whose yearly pay averages $43,000.    Company officials said that in an effort to get the long-stalled talks off dead center, Eastern in the last 10 days withdrew a significant management demand: a plan that would separate skilled and unskilled workers under different contracts. The union has previously said it considers the unified contract sacrosanct.    &quot;It's one of those make-or-break items,&quot; an Eastern official said. &quot;We wanted to get things moving.&quot;    Company officials say that Eastern's deteriorating finances demand a swift resolution of the mediation. Under labor laws that apply to airlines and railroads, the company is unilaterally free to impose its own contract terms 30 days after a federal mediator declares the bargaining has reached an impasse. At that point, the union is also free to strike.    The unions contend that the company is accelerating a strike countdown to induce the employees to strike, and that members would be replaced by cheaper labor. They also contend that Eastern wouldn't be in financial jeopardy if Texas Air hadn't removed Eastern's most profitable divisions, such as its computer reservation, which now operate as Texas Air subsidiaries.    Eastern has also announced plans to sell its profitable East Coast shuttle operations to a newly created unit of Texas Air for $225 million -- including $125 million in cash that would further expand Eastern's war chest against the unions.    Both sides are trying to capitalize on election year politicking in Washington. Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt met with union officials Friday and blasted Eastern for seeking &quot;quick paper profits.&quot; Eastern, in turn, said it was &quot;extremely unfortunate that a collective bargaining situation is being used for cheap political games.&quot;    For its part, Texas Air has been keeping staff members on congressional committees and federal agencies apprised of its position in the labor mediation. And Eastern's unions are lobbying congressional committees and federal agencies to slow -- if not thwart entirely -- the certification of Orion Air, a cargo carrier that Texas Air has retained to fly Eastern planes if its pilots strike.    In letters to the Federal Aviation Administration and the secretary of transportation, a group of House committee members alleged that Orion's maintenance-related records have been deficient in the past and that the package carrier may not be qualified to fly passengers. The congressmen said Orion's record raised &quot;very serious concerns in our minds.&quot;    Eastern, however, has said it will fly safely through any strike and that it is following all certification procedures in its plan to use Orion. </TEXT></DOC>
