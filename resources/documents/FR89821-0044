Theinitial order was issued on April 20, 1988 (53 FR 15253, April 28, 1988).It was renewed effective June 20, 1988 (53 FR 23294, June 21, 1988), andwas renewed again on August 19, 1988 (53 FR 32639, August 26, 1988), October18, 1988 (53 FR 43249, October 26, 1988), December 17, 1988 (53 FR 52207,December 27, 1988) and February 15, 1989 (54 FR 7459, February 21, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Effective October 1, 1988, the Export Administration Regulationswere redesignated as 15 CFR parts 768-799 (53 FR 37751, September 28, 1988).The transfer merely changed the first number of each part from ``3'' to``7''. Until such time as the Code of Federal Regulations is republished,the Regulations may be found in 15 CFR parts 368-399 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In accordance with Department Organization Order 50-1,dated March 23, 1988, the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement isnow the Department official who issues and renews temporary denial orders.In its renewal request of July 25, 1989, the Department states that, sincethe time the initial temporary denial order was issued, and for much ofthe time the renewals have been in effect, the Department has conductedan investigation into Lange's dealings in U.S.-origin commodities. TheDepartment expects a final resolution of this matter in the not too distantfuture. The Department continues to believe, however, that Lange's past patternof conduct demonstrates that there is a likelihood that he will commitfuture violations of the Act and the Regulations. Accordingly, for thereasons set forth below, the Department believes that, until this matteris finally resolved, Lange's export privileges should continue to be temporarilydenied. First, the Department states that, on numerous occasions since the endof 1985, Lange has reexported, without the required reexport authorization,U.S.-origin computers which are controlled for reasons of national securityfrom West Germany to Austria, Yugoslavia and Hungary. The Department also asserts that Lange has provided it with false and misleadinginformation. Specifically, in response to a request from the Departmentthat Lange identify the firms who purchased U.S.-origin equipment fromhim, Lange provided the Department with false invoices in an effort tohide the fact that he had reexported controlled U.S.-origin commoditiesfrom West Germany without the required reexport authorization. In addition, the Department states that a contrast for two U.S.-origincomputers, which are controlled for reasons of national security, existsbetween PPC and a Czechoslovakian foreign trading firm. The Departmentalso believes that Lange and PPC may have attempted to fulfill that contractby trying to obtain, under the name of PPC Computer Handles GmbH, two U.S.-originDEC VAX 8350 computer systems from a supplier in the United Kingdom. The Department continues to believe that Lange's past activities establishthat the violations of the Act and the Regulations which Lange is suspectedof having committed were deliberate and covert and are likely to occuragain unless appropriate action is taken to reduce the likelihood thatLange, PPC, and PCH can continue to acquire U.S.-origin goods either insideor outside of the United States. In addition, the Department believes thatrenewal of the temporary denial order is necessary to give notice to companiesin the United States and abroad that they should cease dealing with Lange,PPC, and PPC Computer Handles GmbH in transactions involving U.S.-origingoods. Therefore, based on the showing made by the Department in its request forrenewal, which neither Lange, PPC, nor PCH has opposed, I find that anorder temporarily denying export privileges to Lange, PPC, and PCH is necessaryin the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of the Act andthe Regulations and to give notice to companies in the United States andabroad to cease dealing with Lange, PPC, and PCH in goods and technicaldata subject to the Act and the Regulations in order to reduce the substantiallikelihood that Lange, PPC, and PCH will continue to engage in activitieswhich are in violation of the Act and the Regulations.Accordingly, it is hereby <T3>Ordered </T3>I. All outstanding validated export licenses in which Wilfried Lange, PurchasingPool Company, or PPC Computer Handles GmbH appear or participate, in anymanner or capacity, are hereby revoked and shall be returned forthwithto the Office of Export Licensing for cancellation. Further, all of Lange's,PPC's, and PCH's privileges of participating, in any manner or capacity,in any special licensing procedure, including, but not limited to, distributionlicenses, are hereby revoked.II.
