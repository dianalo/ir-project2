Crack government troops are closing in on 300 Communist rebels around Mount Bulusan. A few miles away, troops have overrun an important guerrilla camp. Casualties mount on both sides. Generals and politicians call Bicol, as this region is named, a key test in the war against the Communist New People's Army, or NPA.    That's the war as hyped in Manila's newspapers and discussed in Manila's coffee shops. The armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, talks of declaring martial law in the region. President Corazon Aquino flew here last week and called for &quot;an all-out military offensive.&quot;    Manila is about 250 miles from Bulusan. Even 20 miles away, in the provincial capital of Sorsogon, where the most menacing sight is a locally painted poster advertising Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie &quot;Predator,&quot; there is large-scale war talk. One man tells of a major sea and air operation using naval landing craft and army helicopters near Bulusan. &quot;Everyone there is afraid,&quot; the man adds. &quot;One friend told me it was like the Normandy invasion.&quot;    In this small, seaside town close by the slopes of Mount Bulusan, a playground basketball game is disturbed by an inquiring, would-be invasion correspondent. One basketball player, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the Great Seal of Nebraska, remembers the invasion. &quot;A helicopter landed right there yesterday,&quot; he says pointing to a field at the edge of town.    The Rev. Mariano Garrido, the parish priest, remembers the helicopter, too. &quot;Everyone ran away when they saw it coming. It broke up a basketball game,&quot; he says. After a little while, the helicopter-borne soldiers departed, without explanation.    As for landing craft, Father Garrido didn't see any. &quot;Now everything is back to normal,&quot; he adds.    Down the street at city hall, things are normal, too. The mayor is away, but Municipal Coordinator Norberto Nino remembers yesterday's excitement. He isn't sure, but he thinks it happened because townspeople spotted guerrillas in the fields between Bulusan and the mountain. &quot;So the army sent reinforcements of one helicopter,&quot; he reports. He thinks there was also a boat. Office workers were sent home early to be on the safe side, he adds.    But there was no shooting, after all. The reinforcements stayed around for a couple of hours and then went away. Mr. Nino can't be sure how long they stayed because he had paperwork to do at the time.    Four men with automatic weapons are relaxing around the town hall. Mr. Nino says these are the new police contingent sent here a few months ago when the war heated up.    Low as the temperature may still be, the war in Bicol has changed. For years, the conflict in this fertile rice and coconut area with its several tall volcanoes was a quiet standoff during which neither side sought conflict. The government ruled in the towns and the NPA lived in the hillside villages.    Earlier this year, Bicol's Communist commander, Sotero Llamas, a former journalism student whose brother teaches in a Bible college, changed tactics.    Brig. Gen. Luis San Andres, Bicol's senior commander, says that 32 of his officers and men have been killed in the past three months, most of them shot not in combat but while relaxing in town. One officer was drinking coffee at his wife's small shop. Another was riding his motorcycle home, the general says. &quot;They want to isolate the military,&quot; he says of the Communists' use of assassination squads called &quot;Sparrow Units.&quot;    In return, Gen. San Andres has been sent 2,000 army troops to augment the 1,800 troops and 3,000 police under his command. A number of towns also have formed vigilante groups. But these home guards, armed by the military, often use their guns to bully villagers. &quot;The people here are afraid of two groups, the NPA and the vigilantes,&quot; says the Rev. Ernesto Alberto, the parish priest of Polangui.    As with the &quot;Normandy invasion,&quot; both big and little events in this war lead to debated interpretations more often than to clear understanding. In the most dramatic recent actions, four bridges and seven pylons carrying high-tension electric wires have been blown up. Government officials discerned a plan to cut off Bicol, depriving Manila of its farm goods and electric power from its large geothermal plant.    The NPA was silent for some days after the explosions, then claimed credit only for two of the smaller bridges.    Rumors flew. Was the NPA trying to duck responsibility for actions that had quickly driven up prices, made travel difficult and caused public resentment? Or, had dissident military groups done the sabotage in support of Col. Gregorio &quot;Gringo&quot; Honasan, the leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt in Manila? Col. Honasan, who is in hiding, is a Bicol native.    The events in Fabrica village outside the town of Barcelona last week are equally disputed. The armed forces say they killed five rebels in a raid on what they called a Communist camp. The bodies were brought to town where they were given last rites by a Catholic lay brother, Juan Enteria. He says the military told him one soldier died in the fighting.    But the widows of four of the dead in Fabrica traveled to the province capital to deny that their husbands were Communists. According to one of them, Encarnacion Binas, the four couples and their children heard gunfire near their houses and all took shelter together, lying on the floor of her house. Ten minutes after the gunfire ended, soldiers came to her house and ordered the men to accompany them, she says. When she next saw her husband he was dead with multiple gunshot wounds.    Mrs. Binas and the other women took their plea to Sorsogon Gov. Raul Lee who allowed the widows to make a statement over the local radio maintaining that their husbands were innocent victims.    Her case is circumstancially strong. The NPA doesn't take wives and children into the hills with its units and two of the widows have nursing babies. Mrs. Binas says she hasn't any idea why soldiers would murder her husband, who was a tenant farmer.    But despite her claims, her husband is being entered in military records as a dead Communist. </TEXT></DOC>
