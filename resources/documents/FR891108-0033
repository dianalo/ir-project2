Background</ITAG>The Supportive Housing Demonstration Program was authorized in 1987 bysubtitle C of title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act(42 U.S.C. 11381-11388) (McKinney Act) to develop innovative approachesto providing housing and supportive services to the homeless. On June 24,1988, HUD published a final rule for the program (53 FR 23898), which wascodified as 24 CFR part 840 (transitional housing) and part 841 (permanenthousing for the handicapped homeless). On November 7, 1988, the President approved the Stewart B. McKinney HomelessAssistance Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100-628) (1988 Amendments Act), whichmade several changes to the program. Section 485 of the 1988 AmendmentsAct required that HUD publish a notice, for immediate effect, within 60days of enactment implementing the amendments to the program. The noticeof the changes, combined with a notice of funds availability, was publishedon January 9, 1989 (54 FR 736). (The changes were then published in codifiedform on March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12433).) Although the changes announced inthe Notice were effective for this year's funding round, HUD invited publiccomments on the changes for consideration in a final rule, and this finalrule responds to the comments.In addition to changes to the rule by the 1988 Amendments Act, severalother changes have been made to the rule to reflect the Secretary's priorityto end the tragedy of homelessness in this country. Some of these changesrepresent an effort to simplify the application and selection processesand to add clarifications to the rule that the Department believes aredesirable after meetings with homeless service providers across the country,as well as the experience gained in the past two years with the program.The Supportive Housing program has been moved from the Office of the AssistantSecretary for Housing to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for CommunityPlanning and Development during a Departmental reorganization, in orderto combine most of HUD's programs that serve the homeless population underone Assistant Secretary. For this reason, the final rule has been designatedas 24 CFR part 577 (transitional housing) and Part 578 (permanent housingfor the handicapped homeless), and Parts 840 and 841 will be removed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Comments</ITAG>HUD received public comments from the State agencies, one local governmentagency, and two private nonprofit organizations. Two of the comments wereon provisions in the June 24, 1988 final rule. Although the January 9,1989 notice requested comments on the 1988 Amendments Act changes only,HUD is responding to those comments, as well as comments on the changesannounced in the January notice, in today's publication. The comments focusedon the following areas:1. Maximum Period of Residence in Transitional Housing (Section 577.5)One commenter believed that the rule should allow for an additional flexiblesix-month grace period on the maximum period of residence for residentsof transitional housing, because some residents need the extra time tolocate affordable housing, employment, child care, or personal financialmanagement training. When first enacted, section 422(12)(A) of the McKinneyAct defined transitional housing as a project ``that has as its purposefacilitating the movement of homeless individuals to independent livingwithin a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the Secretary.'' TheJune 24, 1988 Supportive Housing final rule provided for a maximum periodof residence of 18 months. Section 443 of the 1988 Amendments Act amendedthe definition of transitional housing to provide for a 24-month periodof residence <T3>``or such longer period as the Secretary determines is necessary tofacilitate the transition of homeless individuals to independent living''</T3>(emphasis supplied). The amended definition of transitional housing,announced in the January 9, 1989 Notice and adopted in this final rule,does not limit the ``longer period'' to a definite period, such as sixmonths, but reflects the discretion allowed by section 433.2. Limitations on New Construction (Sections 577.112 and 578.112)HUD received a comment on the limitation on projects involving new construction.The commenter argued that new construction activities should not be limitedto projects involving state universities, because new construction is oftenjust as cost-effective, if not more so, than rehabilitation of existingstructures.Until enactment of section 449(b) of the 1988 Amendments Act, assistanceto defray the cost of new construction of facilities was not authorizedunder the Supportive Housing program. Section 449(b) allows advances fornew construction, but imposes very strict limitations on the projects thatwill qualify for a new construction advance. These limitations are statutoryand are outside the discretion of HUD.3. Limitation on Use of Assistance (Sections 577.125 and 578.125)One commenter stated that funding should not be limited to new programsor to the expansion of existing ones, but that the rule should recognizethat current levels of services provided by existing programs are equallydeserving of funding. Because the Supportive Housing program was establishedas a demonstration program to determine innovative approaches to providingsupportive housing for the homeless, HUD believed it was appropriate tofund new projects that could be studied to determine their success. Anothergoal of the program was, and still is, to increase the number of supportivehousing facilities available to assist homeless individuals and families.HUD believes these justifications are still convincing, but also recognizesthat there are existing programs that may need and deserve assistance withrehabilitating structures to bring them to a level that meets State orlocal government health and safety standards. This will help to assurethat available housing for the homeless meets applicable standards. Therefore,the rule has been changed to allow funding for improvements to existingfacilities where the improvements are necessary to meet health and safetystandards.4. Matching Funds (Sections 577.130 and 578.130)A commenter asserted that, when used as a matching source of funds, volunteertime should be valued at prevailing wages and salaries, rather than at$5 an hour (andSection;andSection;577.130(c) and 578.130(c)). The commenterfelt that a project with a strong volunteer component as an integral partof its program should be rewarded. HUD agrees that volunteers play a vitalrole in providing housing and supportive services to the homeless. However,HUD believes that the legislative history of section 452 of the 1988 AmendmentsAct reflects the intent of Congress that these services be valued at $5an hour.Section 452 allows the value of volunteeer time and services to be consideredas matching funds for Supportive Housing funds, at a rate to be determinedby the Secretary. The legislative history of this provision shows thatthe House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs authorized volunteertime and services to be counted as a source of matching funds because suchsources were authorized in the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program andthe two programs should be uniform in approach. According to the HouseReport, the Committee believed that the value of volunteer time and servicesshould be calculated ``in the same manner as in the Emergency Shelter GrantsProgram.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 100-718, part II, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 38 (1988).)HUD interprets this to mean that Congress intended that the value of volunteertime and services in the Supportive Housing program should be calculatedat $5 an hour, which is the value used for calculating such services inthe ESG program (24 CFR 576.71(b)).The commenter also expressed the opinion that the matching source requirementshould be reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent and, in addition, thatother Federal funds, such as Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),Community Services Block Grants (CSBG), and ESG, should be eligible matchingresources.Section 425 of the McKinney Act requires that recipients supplement advancesfor acquisition/substantial rehabilitation or new construction and grantsfor moderate rehabilitation with an equal amount of funds from non-Federalsources. HUD does not have the discretion to depart from this statutoryrequirement that recipients match these types of assistance dollar fordollar.A 1988 amendment to section 425 requires that matching sources for advancesfor acquisition/substantial rehabilitation or new construction and grantsfor moderate rehabilitation be from non-Federal sources. HUD has changedthe final rule in andSection;andSection;577.130(b) and 578.130(b) to indicatethat the only assistance for which HUD will require that matching fundsbe from non-Federal sources is for advances for acquisition/substantialrehabilitation or new construction and grants for moderate rehabilitation.The change also clarifies that HUD does not consider Community DevelopmentBlock Grants (CDGB) or CSBG funds to be Federal funds for matching purposes.Section 423 allows HUD to provide grants for payment of operating costs``not to exceed 75 percent of the annual operating costs'' of transitionalhousing projects, and ``not to exceed 50 percent of the annual operatingcosts * * * for the first year of operation, and not to exceed 25 percent* * * for the second year of operation'' of permanent housing for handicappedhomeless persons. Under this statutory authorization of assistance foroperating costs, HUD does not have the discretion to pay more than 50 percentof such costs for the first year of operation and 25 percent for the secondyear in the case of permanent housing for handicapped homeless persons.However, HUD has changed the final rule to allow assistance for operatingcosts for transitional housing for up to 75 percent of such costs duringthe first two years of operation, and up to 50 percent for three yearsthereafter. This increase up to the statutory limit for two years providesprojects with more assistance during the crucial start-up years but recognizesthat, after the initial years of a project, there should be a broad baseof community support for the project and, therefore, greater resourcesfrom private sources should be available to replace McKinney Act funds.HUD has also changed the final rule in andSection; 577.117 with regard togrants for employment assistance programs (EAPs). Grants for EAPs wereauthorized for transitional housing projects in the 1988 Amendments Act,although the legislation was silent on the recipient's percentage shareof the cost. In implementing EAP assistance in the January 1988 Notice,HUD made available assistance for EAPs for up to 50 percent of the costsfor up to five years. In order to make EAP assistance consistent with operatingcosts assistance, HUD has changed the final rule to allow EAP assistancefor up to 75 percent of the costs during the first two years of operation,and up to 50 percent for three years thereafter. 5. Ranking Criteria (Sections 577.215 and 578.215) One commenter addressed the point system used to score applications inthe competition for funding. (The rule provides the criteria under whichapplications are ranked, but it does not set forth the actual number ofpoints awarded under a particular criterion.) The commenter stated thatit understood that applicants without site control receive no points underthat criterion. The commenter believed that scoring should be based insteadon a sliding scale, taking into consideration the likelihood of an applicant'ssecuring site control within a specified period of time. The commenteralso believed that the number of points awarded on the basis of the sitecontrol criterion (25 percent of the maximum points that may be awarded)was too high. Section 450 of the 1988 Amendments Act provides that the extent to whichan applicant has control of the site of a proposed project will be a rankingcriterion. During the 1989 funding competition, applicants that demonstratedownership or a contract of sale, a 10-year lease, or an option to buy orlease for 10 years were awarded the maximum number of points possible underthis criterion. Applicants could also receive points, on a sliding scale,depending on the likelihood of site control within six months after notificationof an award. For example, points were awarded for a lease for less thana 10-year period (with the option to extend at the sole discretion of theapplicant), or for a showing that the applicant was engaged in negotiationswith a specific seller or lessor for a specific property, with reasonablehopes of consummation by the time awards are made. HUD does not routinely include in its rules the number of points awardedunder ranking criteria. This allows HUD the flexibility to change the pointsystem as necessary, based on the experience gained with each funding round,especially in the case of new programs such as Supportive Housing. However,the number of points that will be awarded for each ranking criterion ina specific funding round will be included in the application package forthat round. HUD believes that will give sufficient notice to applicantsof the method HUD will use in ranking applications. HUD will take the commentregarding the number of points for site control into account when decidingthe ranking system for the 1990 funding competition. The commenter also questioned why applications requesting grants for operatingcosts only are downgraded in scoring. HUD does not differentiate betweenrequests for funds for acquisition or rehabilitation of a structure andfunds for operating costs during the review and ranking process. In thepast, points were given if an applicant did not include costs for supportiveservices in the operating budget, since HUD wanted to encourage projectsto make use of supportive services that were available in the community.This particular provision has been eliminated from the final rule in andSection;577.215(b)(4) in recognition of the fact that often there are not sufficientfunds or services available. HUD will still consider the extent to whichan applicant proposes to use or coordinate with other public or privateentities to provide supportive services. This policy is consistent withone of the initiatives under the Secretary's priority on homelessness,which is to mobilize all the nation's resources, both public and private.HUD believes the supportive services offered to residents of transitionalhousing are a vital part of the goal of ending homelessness. Although theMcKinney Act treats the cost of providing supportive services as an operatingcost, HUD has separated supportive services costs from operating costsin the final rule to emphasize the importance the Department places onthem. This change is discussed elsewhere in the preamble. 6. Environmental Review by Applicants (sections 577.220(c) and 578.220(b))One commenter addressed the change that requires States, metropolitan cities,urban counties, and other units of general local government to assume responsibilityfor the environmental review. The commenter believes that HUD's environmentalreview procedures in 24 CFR part 58, for which HUD requires the applicantsdescribed above to assume responsibility, are too time-consuming and strict,causing delays in beginning construction. The commenter though that thereshould be a provision for a waiver of compliance with HUD procedures forapplicants that are subject to other state and local environmental reviewrequirements. Section 482 of the 1988 Amendments Act provides that the regulations andprocedures applicable under section 104(g) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974 are to be applied to the Supportive Housing program.Section 104(g) authorizes HUD to assign the Federal environmental responsibilitiesto grantees deemed to have the legal capacity for environmental review(States, metropolitan cities, urban counties, and other units of generallocal government) and to define how the responsibilities are to be performed.The regulations at 24 CFR part 58 describe the requirements for granteesthat assume the responsibilities. The 1988 Amendments Act recognizes that the objectives of the SupportiveHousing program are best served by a consolidation of environmental reviewresponsibilities at the applicant level. Many applicants seek funding underother McKinney Act programs, and a single environmental review should oftensuffice for those applicants. According to the Report of the House Committeeon Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, the intent of section 482 of the1988 Amendments Act was to expedite the consideration of applications.However, the Report states that the Committee expects all applicants toadhere to all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)and that ``this amendment does not lessen any requirement for any projectto comply with the NEPA standards.'' (See H.R. Rep. No. 100-718, part II,100th Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1988).) The requirements of statutes Executire Orders, and the regulations of oversightagencies that are imposed on applicants through Part 58 cannot be waived.Requirements arising out of a statute or Executive Order to not allow forwaivers. Those that are regulatory, <T3>i.e., </T3>the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations (40CFR parts 1500-1508) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservationregulations (36 CFR part 800), make some provision for ``emergencies,''but these are for conditions more extreme than a concern for processingdelays. Compliance with the review processes and time periods under theauthorities listed in 24 CFR 58.5 is mandatory_whether responsibility forreview is assigned to the applicant under section 104(g) or retained andexercised by HUD under 24 CFR part 50. In addition, HUD has no legislativeauthority to allow the applicability of State or local environmental requirementsto substitute for the Federal requirements. In andSection;andSection; 577.220(b)(3) and 578.220(b)(3), the final rule clarifiesthat applicants assuming responsibility for environmental reviews may arrangefor local governments, with the appropriate technical capability, to conductthe technical review, as long as the applicants still retain all legalresponsibilities, <T3>i.e., </T3>independently evaluate information submitted and assumeresponsibility for its accuracy, scope, and content. Applicants may alsoadopt prior reviews conducted by HUD or another governmental unit if thereviews meet the particular requirements of the Federal environmental lawor authority under which they would be adopted, and only under certainconditions (<T3>e.g.,</T3> a determination that no environmentally significant changeshave occurred since the review was done). 7. Location of Projects in Floodplains (sections 577.220(e) and 578.220(e))HUD received a comment on the floodplains restriction contained in theJanuary 9 notice for the permanent housing for the handicapped homelesscomponent of the Supportive Housing program. Under that provision, allprojects for the handicapped homeless were deemed to be critical actions(<T3>i.e., </T3>any activity for which even a slight chance of floodingwould be too great). The Floodplain Management Guidelines implementingExecutive Order 11988, Floodplain Management (43 FR 6030 (Feb. 10, 1978)),require that all critical actions proposed to be located in a 500-yearfloodplain comply with an eight-step public notification and decision-makingprocess. The commenter argued that, by classifying all projects involvinghandicapped groups as critical actions, the restriction conflicts withsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and TitleVIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601-3620), as amendedby the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-430, approved September13, 1988). These statutes prohibit discrimination based on handicap. The commenter also argued that the restriction was contrary to a SupremeCourt opinion in <T3>City of Cleburne </T3>v. <T3>Cleburne Living Center, </T3>473 U.S. 432 (1985), which held that acity ordinance requiring a special use permit for a group home for thementally retarded was invalid as applied under the Equal Protection clause.In reviewing various objections of the City Council to the home's location,the Court dismissed the Council's objection to locating the home in a 500-yearfloodplain by pointing out that concern with the possibility of a floodcould hardly be based on distinction between the home and facilities suchas nursing homes, homes of convalescents or the aged, or sanitariums orhospitals, all of which could have been located on the site without obtaininga special use permit.The commenter also asserted that the eight-step process would result indisqualification of a proposed site in the 500-year floodplain if anotherproperty is for sale outside the floodplain, regardless of whether thealternative property was affordable or met the occupants' needs. The commenterargued that the issue of personal or physical safety was never a factorin the original establishment of flood zones.HUD notes that, while floodplain restrictions were established under theNational Flood Insurance Program before Executive Order 11988 was issuedin 1977, the Executive Order requires agencies to take action ``to minimizethe impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare.'' The implementingFloodplain Management Guidelines, issued by the U.S. Water Resources Councilthe following year (43 FR 6030, Feb. 10, 1978), indicate that a key questionwith regard to critical actions is whether, given the flood warning leadtime available, ``occupants of buildings such as hospitals, schools andnursing homes [would] be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life andinjury.'' Under the Executive Order, personal safety in flood situationsis thus a significant consideration in decisionmaking on both the locationand the design of facilities proposed for Federal assistance. (HUD alsonotes that the Executive Order and Guidelines require consideration onlyof <T3>practicable</T3> alternative sites ouside the floodplain, and do notrequire rejection of floodplain sites in favor of unaffordable, inaccessible,or otherwise ill-suited non-floodplain locations.)Finally, HUD views the <T3>Cleburne</T3> case as inapposite to the Executive Order process; inapparent contrast to the local permitting process cited in the <T3>Cleburne </T3>case, HUD considers hospitals, nursing homes, and convalescenthomes assisted under its programs to be critical actions that <T3>are </T3>subject to the Executive Order process when located in a 500-yearfloodplain. Moreover, proposed location of such facilities in the 500-yearfloodplain can lead to rejection of the site only if practicable locationalternatives exist; the most likely outcome is a review of project designto ensure occupant safety, rather than site rejection.Upon reconsideration, nevertheless, HUD has amended the final rule, sinceHUD has concluded that the treatment of <T3>all </T3>projects for handicapped persons under this program as criticalactions in overinclusive. Persons with one type of handicap may experienceno difficulty in evacuating a structure or following instructions on safetyin the event of flooding, while persons with another type might have varyingdegrees of difficulty. However, because there is an insufficient basisat this time for differentiating among handicapped groups to be servedby facilities assisted under the permanent housing program, the rule willnot treat any project for the handicapped as a critical action. For thesame reason, HUD is also revising the transitional housing rule to eliminatetreatment of facilities under that program for the developmentally disabled,chronically mentally ill, mobility impaired as critical actions. All SupportiveHousing projects will be subject to the eight-step process only when locatedin a 100-year floodplain, which is the restriction that applies to allnon-critical actions in accordance with Executive Order 11988. HUD is developing a proposed rule to provide an agency-wide floodplainregulation. When that rule is published, HUD will seek public comment onthe scope of the definition of ``critical action,'' any may revisit thisissue when a more educated decision can be made with regard to differentiatingamong handicapped groups. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Other Changes</ITAG>As a result of the effort to simplify the application and selection processand to clarify the rule, HUD has made several other changes to the program,and has reorganized the rule. A discussion of the major changes follows,but the reader is advised to read the rule carefully for minor changesand reorganization not discussed in the preamble.Definitions Section (577.5 and 578.5)In the definition of applicant for the permanent housing for handicappedhomeless persons program, the rule now provides that an applicant may bethe State housing finance agency or the State agency that customarily implementshousing programs for the State and that is identified by statute to participatein housing programs in the State. HUD has interpreted section 424(a)(2)(F)(ii)of the McKinney Act as allowing States to designate such an agency to fulfillthe State's responsibilities in a permanent housing project.The definitions of moderate rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitationhave been changed to distinguish between the two types of rehabilitation.Under the McKinney Act, the two types were originally distinguished bythe amount of assistance allowed_up to $200,000 for substantial rehabilitationand up to $100,000 for moderate rehabilitation. The assistance for substantialrehabilitation was in the form of an advance, which was subject to repaymentunder certain conditions. The assistance for moderate rehabilitation wasin the form of a grant. The legislative history indicates that Congressintended that ``moderate rehabilitation should be limited to modest rehabilitationactivity the cost of which the Secretary determines is too low to necessitatean advance.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 100-174, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 78 (1987).In the 1988 Amendments Act, Congress removed the amount of assistance asa distinction by authorizing grants for up to $200,000 for moderate rehabilitationbut, at the same time, retaining the $200,000 limitation for advances forsubstantial rehabilitation. The characterization of the assistance as ``advances''for substantial rehabilitation and ``grants'' for moderate rehabilitationwas unchanged by the 1988 Amendments Act. HUD believes some distinctionshould be made between the two types of assistance_especially since theadvances for substantial rehabilitation are subject to repayment. Therefore,the final rule now contains definitions of the two types of rehabilitationthat are based on the extent of rehabilitation to the structure, as indicatedby the comparison between the cost of rehabilitation and the fair marketvalue of the structure before rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of a projectinvolving costs of 75 percent or less of the value of the structure beforerehabilitation will be considered moderate rehabilitation, and costs inexcess of 75 percent of the value of the structure before rehabilitationwill be considered substantial. The definition of operation costs no longer includes as operating coststhe provision of supportive services to residents or conducting supportiveservices needs assessments. This is a technical amendment to separate thesupportive services costs from operating costs, since the two types ofcosts are being funded separately, as discussed below. The cost of providingrelocation assistance, under andSection;andSection;577.315 or 578.315, to personsdisplaced as a result of a transitional housing or permanent housing projectassisted by HUD has been added to the definition as an operating cost eligiblefor assistance.The definition of rehabilitation has been amended to include any costsof structural changes necessary to make a structure accessible for personswith physical handicaps, as required for structures with 15 or more unitsby section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and implemented in 24CFR 8.23(a) or (b).The definition of supportive services for residents of transitional housinghas been expanded to include the purpose of such services as facilitatingthe movement of residents to independent living. Likewise, the definitionof supportive services for residents of permanent housing for handicappedhomeless persons has been expanded to include the purpose of maximizingthe residents' ability to live as independently as possible within theirenvironment. HUD believes that these new definitions emphasize the roleof supportive services in reaching the goal of ending homelessness.Assistance Provided_Subparts B of Parts 577 and 578The sections describing advances for acquisition/substantial rehabilitation(andSection;andSection;577.105 and 578.105), grants for moderate rehabilitation(andSection;andSection;577.110 and 578.110), and advances for new construction(andSection;andSection;577.112 and 578.112) have been amended to allow an advanceor grant in an amount not to exceed the lower of $200,000 or the totalcost of the acquisition/substantial rehabilitation, moderate rehabilitation,or new construction minus the applicant's contribution toward the cost.The rule formerly provided that the maximum advance or grant availablecould not exceed the lower of $200,000 or 50 percent of the cost of theacquisition/substantial rehabilitation, new construction, or moderate rehabilitation.In some circumstances, applicants were unable to utilize the full valueof a matching source. In the sections describing grants for moderate rehabilitation,the ``project limit'' on grants has also been removed. The project limitwas a complicated formula that was difficult for applicants to understandand difficult for HUD to administer. The experience of the past two yearsshows that it was also unnecessary.Grants for operating costs (andSection;andSection;577.115 and 578.115) nowinclude a separate category for supportive services costs. This changedoes not allow an applicant to receive more assistance than under the formerrule, which included supportive services costs as an operating cost, butprovides HUD with a reviewing tool in assessing applications, as well asinformation on the cost of providing supportive service. With the increasedemphasis on the role of supportive services in ending homelessness, HUDbelieves it is necessary to break out the cost of providing supportiveservices to demonstrate the importance of such services. Grants for supportiveservices costs are subject to the same limitations on amounts and timeperiods as grants for operating costs.The rule has also been changed to provide that HUD will obligate fundingfor operating costs and supportive services costs, as well as for costsassociated with EAPs, based on the recipient's estimate of the amount necessaryfor five years of operation, rather than limiting each year's funding levelto the recipient's estimate of costs for the first year of operation. Acompanion change has been made to andSection;andSection;577.400 and 578.400on deobligation for the sake of consistency.Although the rule has not been changed with regard to providing technicalassistance only in connection with awards of other assistance, HUD staffwill, to the extent possible, give technical assistance to potential applicantswith questions relating to the application.Limitations on Use of Assistance (Sections 577.125 and 578.125)The paragraphs in the former rule prohibiting the use of acquisition/substantialrehabilitation advances to defray the costs of acquiring a lease have beeneliminated as unnecessary. However, the rule still provides that advancesfor acquisition/substantial rehabilitation and grants for moderate rehabilitationmay be used to rehabilitate leased structures. That provision now appearsin the section describing the types of assistance available (andSection;andSection;577.100and 578.100).Paragraphs (c) of andSection;andSection;577.125 and 578.125, which describethe limitations on the use of assistance by primarily religious organizations,contain provisions governing the circumstances under which HUD will provideassistance to a recipient that is a primarily religious organization ora wholly secular organization established by a primarily religious organization(or, as in the case of premanent housing, to a recipient that uses suchan organization as a project sponsor). With one exception noted below,these provisions are substantially identical to those set out in 24 CFRpart 570, which consists of HUD's community development block grant program(CDBG) entitlement rules.Under these provisions, a primarily religious organization (or wholly secularorganization established by a primarily religious organization) must agreeto provide housing and supportive services in a manner that is free fromreligious influence. In this connection, the provider must: (1) Not discriminateagainst any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of religionand not limit employment or give employment preference to persons on thebasis of religion; (2) not discriminate against, or limit the provisionof housing or supportive services, to applicants for such housing or serviceson the basis of religion; and (3) provide no religious instruction or counseling,conduct no religious worship or services, engage in no religious proselytizing,or otherwise exert no religious influence in the provision of housing orsupportive services.As noted, the foregoing principles depart in one fashion from the CDBGentitlement rule at 24 CFR 570.200(j)(3) (53 FR 34416, 34412, Sept. 6,1988), which contains an additional restriction that the portion of thefacility of the primarily religious organization used to provide fundedservices ``shall contain no religious symbols or decorations, other thanthose permanently affixed to or part of the structure.''This policy has been followed for several years in connection with CDBGand homeless assistance made available through primarily religious organizationproviders. The Department has a continuing commitment to optimize participationby religious providers, which have long been in the forefront in assistingthe homeless and other most needy, but in a manner consistent with thestrictures imposed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ofthe United States Constitution. After a review of the relevant case law,the Department has not found dispositive case addressing the provisionof government assistance to a primarily religious organization providingsocial services in a setting where the presence of religious symbols ordecorations alone constitutes a violation of the Establishment Clause.The provision in question, which was recommended to HUD by counsel representinga nationally prominent primarily religious organization as a protectionagainst impermissibly advancing religion, has been utilized in the spiritin which it was so recommended. However, as noted, HUD's examination ofthe case law has concluded that the excised language suggests a degreeof control on the presence of religious symbols or decorations that isnot compelled thereunder, or is not otherwise intrinsic to traditionalConstitutional Church/State separation doctrine as pronounced by the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Accordingly, this rule does not include the prohibitionon religious symbols or decorations. Further, an amendment removing thequoted text from andSection;570.200(j)(3)(iv) is included in this documentas a final rule.This change in no way contravenes the purpose of the underlying principlesin these rules, namely, that a primarily religious organization, or a whollysecular organization established by a primarily religious organization,can only provide housing and supportive services (or CDBG public services)in a manner that is free from religious influence violative of the EstablishmentClause, specifically including the explicit provisions described above.The limitation on the use of assistance for administrative costs has beenexpanded to include all grants and advances (paragraphs (e)). The provisionalso clarifies that administrative costs are those costs associated withadministering the assistance provided by HUD.Assistance Under Other HUD Programs (Sections 577.135 and 578.135)The requirement in the rule that applicants wishing to purchase HUD-ownedsingle family homes request a PHA or local government to enter into a lease/optionagreement with HUD has been eliminated, since PHAs were sometimes reluctantto be involved in these arrangements. The rule now allows the applicantto enter into the agreement with HUD. The applicant may not occupy theproperty, however, until after closing the sale. During the lease term,the applicant will be responsible for all maintenance costs and taxes onthe property.Matching Requirements (Sections 577.130 and 578.130)The rule has been changed to provide that the requirement that matchingfunds be from non-Federal sources applies only to advances for acquisition/substantialrehabilitation or new construction and grants for moderate rehabilitation.This change adheres to the statutory provisions in section 452 of the 1988Amendments Act. Section 452 also allows all sources of matching funds,including ``in-kind'' contributions, to be included as a match for an applicant'srequest for advances for acquisition/substantial rehabilitation or newconstruction and grants for moderate rehabilitation. The rule has beenchanged to allow all such matching sources for those advances or grants,regardless of whether the contribution relates to that type of assistance.The rule also states that HUD considers funds from Community DevelopmentBlock Grants and Community Service Block Grants as non-Federal sources.The requirement that applicants seeking funding for existing programs commitnew funds in order to satisfy the matching requirement has been eliminated.While HUD still requires that these programs propose expansions of servicesin order to be eligible for funding (except where funds are sought to bringhousing up to applicable standards), the requirement for new funds formatching purposes has been a burdensome one for some projects and a difficultone for HUD to assess. HUD's goal is to fund projects that are dedicatedto serving the homeless with as few hindrances to that end as possible.If an existing facility serves all the purposes of the McKinney Act andmeets all the other requirements of the Supportive Housing program exceptfor a match of new money, HUD believes it would be too restrictive a viewto refuse to review such an application.Application and Selection Process (Subparts D of Parts 577 and 578)The sections describing the application and selection process have beenreorganized in an effort to simplify both the rule and the process. Thesection on threshold requirements has been removed. The requirements previouslydescribed as ``threshold'' were evaluated as to subject matter, and severalwere moved to the sections on application requirements, ranking criteria,or program requirements. (Many of the threshold requirements were repeatedin those sections in the former rule.) Others have been eliminated fromthe rule altogether, because HUD would like to remain as flexible as possiblewhen evaluating applications. In keeping with the Secretary's prioritygoal of ending homelessness, HUD will review each application with a desireto fund as many projects as possible, without imposing stringent thresholdrequirements that may keep potentially fundable applications from the competition.Two new ranking criteria have been added to the permanent housing rule(andSection; 578.215) to emphasize the purpose of maximizing the abilityof residents to live independently within the permanent housing environmentand to underscore the statutory requirement that permanent housing projectsbe integrated into the neighborhoods in which they are located. Anotherstatutory ranking criterion_the need for such supportive housing in thearea to be served_has been added to both transitional and permanent housing.This was in the former rule as a threshold requirement.The ranking criterion for employment assistance programs in the transitionalhousing rule (andSection; 577.215(b)(7)) has been expanded to include assessmentof the quality of the program, as well as whether the program meets thestatutory requirements of providing for employment of residents in thehousing and payments for transportation costs. The addition of criteriaby which HUD will assess the quality of the program emphasizes the importanceHUD places on programs that show a commitment to facilitating the movementof homeless people to independent living.Paragraph (b) was added to andSection;andSection; 577.225 and 578.225 to describethe procedure HUD will follow in the event of a tie between applicantsafter the ranking process. HUD will use the quality of the proposal andthe need for the project in the area as factors in choosing between theapplicants. During the review and selection period, if HUD makes a proceduralerror that, if corrected, would result in an application being funded thatwas not funded, HUD may fund the application during the next funding round(andSection;andSection; 577.225(c) and 578.225(c)).Program Requirements (Subparts E of Parts 577 and 578)The sections on program requirements have been reorganized to eliminateredundancies and simplify the rule. Most of the provisions in the formerrule are still in the new final rule, but have been either moved or combinedwith other requirements.HUD has removed the provision in the former rule to the effect that restrictionson the use of structures be contained in covenants recorded in land recordswhen acquisition/substantial rehabilitation advances or moderate rehabilitationgrants were awarded to private nonprofit organizations. Comments receivedfrom providers of housing for the homeless in meetings and workshops haveconvinced HUD that this provision is difficult to enforce, given the varyinglaws of jurisdictions. In addition, the provision imposes an unfair userestriction on owners of property leased to recipients, when the owneris not a party to the grant agreement between HUD and the recipient. Theremoval of this provision, however, is not an indication of a lowered commitmenton HUD's part to enforcing the grant agreements in other appropriate ways.The provisions on eminent domain and prevention of undue benefits thatwere a part of the former rule have been included in the section on repaymentof advances (andSection;andSection; 577.310 and 578.310), since, in effect,they provide for HUD to be reimbursed for assistance if, during the 20-yearperiod following the date of initial occupancy, an assisted structure istaken under an eminent domain proceeding or is sold or otherwise disposedof by the recipient. Paragraph (d)(ii) has been added to the final ruleto include the statutory exception to this requirement for sales or otherdispositions that result in the continued use of the project for the directbenefit of lower income persons or where all proceeds are used to providesupportive housing.A former requirement, to the effect that the recipient carry casualty insurance,with HUD as the beneficiary, in an amount at least equal to the amountof assistance provided by HUD, has been removed. This is not practicalfor governmental units since they, for the most part, are self-insured.OMB Circular A-102, which is implemented in 24 CFR part 85 and applicableto recipients of assistance under parts 577 and 578, requires such insuranceto be carried by private nonprofit organizations when real property isacquired with Federal assistance.A new section has been added to each rule (andSection;andSection; 577.315 and578.315) regarding relocation assistance to persons who are displaced asa result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of a structure tobe assisted under the Supportive Housing Demonstration program. HUD iscurrently amending all its regulations to comply with the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 and new governmentwideimplementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. The rule now requires recipientsto provide relocation assistance to displaced persons. Under the formerrule, a threshold requirement made ineligible for funding any project thatwould result in the displacement of persons. When HUD promulgated the formerrule in June 1988, the preamble to that rule stated that the provisionson displacement would be reviewed after the governmentwide regulationswere promulgated. The change in the rule announced today is a result ofthat review.HUD has removed the requirement that transitional housing recipients executecontracts with the residents of transitional housing before admission.Such contracts were for the purpose of limiting the resident's length ofstay in the housing and preempting any State or local law to the extentthat it prohibited the recipient from discharging the resident at the endof the term. The rule also described a procedure for a resident-requestedreview of the discharge date following notice of such date to the resident.This provision has also been removed. The rule, in andSection; 577.325, stillcontains a preemption of State or local laws to the extent they prohibitrecipients from discharging residents at the end of the 24-month residencyperiod, but it does not require recipients to execute contracts with residents.Whether or not a recipient executes a contract setting forth the resident'slength of stay (or any other terms or conditions regarding the relationshipbetween the recipient and resident) is discretionary with the recipient.However, the recipient must give the resident written notice at least 30days prior to the end of the resident's length of stay.Section 422(12)(B) of the McKinney Act requires that each permanent housingproject for handicapped homeless persons be either a home designed solelyfor housing handicapped persons or dwelling units in a multi-family housingproject, condominium project, or cooperative project. Only one home maybe located on any one site, and that home may not be on a site contiguousto another site containing another home. This statutory requirement, whichwas not in the former rule, is included in this final rule in andSection;578.325(a).In addition, paragraph (b) of that section contains the statutory requirementthat permanent housing projects must be integrated into the neighborhoodsin which they are located. The rule describes the factors HUD will considerindicative of neighborhood integration. These include neighborhood acceptanceof the project, participation by residents in neighborhood activities andinstitutions, integration of the project into community plans, compatibilityof the project with local zoning determinations, and the provision of supportiveservices outside the housing facility but within the neighborhood.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
