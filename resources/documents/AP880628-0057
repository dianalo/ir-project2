(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Middlemen who profit from surrogate birthsrisk up to five years in prison and $50,000 in fines under a lawthat makes Michigan the first state to attach criminal sanctions topregnancy-for-pay deals.   Gov. James Blanchard on Monday signed into law a bill that makesarranging such deals a felony beginning Sept. 1. Advertising orotherwise ``inducing'' a woman to become a surrogate also will be afelony.   ``It's a major victory,'' Jeremy Rifkin, co-chair of theNational Coalition Against Surrogacy, said in Washington.   ``Michigan will be leading the way with this legislation,'' saidstate Sen. Connie Binsfeld, leader of a five-year drive to outlawsurrogacy.   ``I believe the Legislature and the governor have carried out avery strong moral obligation to protect children from becomingcommodities under commercial contracts,'' said the Republicansenator.   The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union'sMichigan chapter said he was contemplating a legal challengeagainst the law.   ``It's hard to understand how a governor who's pro-choice wouldcriminalize the process when a surrogate mother and a couple wishto bring life into this world,'' said Howard Simon.   In announcing his decision, the Democratic governor said hesigned the law despite reservations because he believed it wasbetter than none at all.   ``By taking the profit out of childbirth, it stands firm againstthe buying and selling of human life,'' he said.   Also under the law, those who contract for a birth and women whoagree to bear a child for money will risk misdemeanor penalties ofup to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.   Typically, infertile couples pay $10,000 to be matched with awould-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman who agreesto be artifically inseminated, carry the child, then give upcustody. They also pay for the hospital bills and pregnancy-relatedexpenses.   The law would still allow a woman who wants to bear a child andthen give up the baby to another couple to do so, while havingpregnancy-related bills paid. But the mother could get no fee andany middleman would have to work for free.   The law doesn't address the legality for a Michigan couple tosign a contract in another state and carry out the agreement inMichigan, said Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney, who has arranged228 surrogate births, including New Jersey's ``Baby M.''   ``Maybe the arrangement of a contract could be anywhere outsideMichigan, and the insemination, the birth, the payment, everythingelse take place inside Michigan,'' said Keane.   Keane said a constitutional challenge probably would be based ona 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing as part of theright to privacy the right to beget children without unwarrantedgovernmental intrusion.   The mother of ``Baby M,'' Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, sued Keanewhen she decided to keep her child. She won an out-of-courtsettlement for an amount reported at between $30,000 and $40,000.   But in a landmark custody battle over the girl she bore under a$10,000 contract, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould won only visitation rights.On Feb. 3, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted custody of the2-year-old girl, now legally known as Melissa, to the child'sfather, William Stern.   The court, in overturning part of a lower court ruling, alsooutlawed surrogacy for pay and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights to the child.   Michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties tosurrogate-parent contracts, but not the first to address the issue.   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring suchcontracts illegal, but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraskadoesn't recognize the legal validity of surrogate-parentingcontracts. Indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on holdwhile the issue is researched, and proposed regulations were vetoedin Arkansas.   Harold Cassidy, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, said statesgenerally have not have not enforced those statutes ``out ofapparent confusion as to whether such enforcement would representthe will of the people,'' he said.   He said many states will follow Michigan's lead, and``prosecutors will no longer have a choice'' in bringing chargesagainst surrogacy brokers.</TEXT></DOC>
