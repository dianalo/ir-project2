Some were fired from jobs they had held for years, for reasons, they were told, that had to do with politics. Makeshift refugee camps are being set up to house those who are being denied permission to cross the border.    This isn't a scene from last week's TV miniseries &quot;Amerika.&quot; This real-life drama is being played out right now in such border cities as Buffalo and Detroit. Thousands of illegal Latin American aliens are fleeing the U.S. because of the new immigration law's crackdown on employers who hired them.    Some U.S. employers, who in June will face jail terms and fines ranging from $250 to $10,000 for each illegal alien hired after last Nov. 6, are letting go all of their undocumented employees -- including some hired long before the cutoff date.    At least 4,000 illegals have fled to Canada, long known for its generous acceptance of immigrants and refugees. But faced with a flood of displaced workers from the U.S., Canada began Monday to close its open-door policy and is turning back people at the border pending hearings on their cases.    The spectacle of people fleeing the United States, a nation built by immigrants and long the beacon of hope for the poor and oppressed, is tragic. Adding irony is the fact that when employer sanctions actually take effect the results will neither justify the fears of many illegal aliens nor satisfy the expectations of those in Congress who voted for them. The fact is that such laws simply don't work.    Wayne Cornelius of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego has said, &quot;There is not a single documented case of successfully using employer-sanctions laws to reduce the population of illegal immigrants anywhere in the world.&quot; The main reasons, according to a study by the Los Angeles Times are &quot;weak enforcement, court challenges and political resistance&quot; once the negative economic effects of not hiring illegal aliens are felt.    A total of 11 states have enacted employer-sanctions legislation since California led the way in 1970. &quot;By cracking down on these employers who knowingly engage in the hiring of illegal aliens,&quot; then-Gov. Ronald Reagan said in signing California's landmark measure into law, &quot;this legislation can help to improve job opportunities for thousands of legitimate California residents. . . .&quot; Despite promises of tough enforcement, not a single employer has ever been prosecuted under the California law.    The enormous political capital spent in passing federal sanctions means that at least some attempt will be made at enforcement and, therefore, at least some people whose only crime is crossing a border will be denied a means of supporting their families. But soon enforcement nightmares, clogged courts and economic costs will force reconsideration of this anti-worker legislation.    Congress eventually will realize that fostering economic growth in Latin America and other areas of potential conflict is the only way to reduce the numbers of people who feel compelled to leave their homes. That means encouraging countries to lower incentive-killing tax rates, break up state-sanctioned monopolies and free flourishing underground economies. It means making certain that such countries as the Philippines and El Salvador are able to fight off communist guerrillas and communist neighbors whose victory would create untold numbers of U.S.-bound refugees. That is a more humane approach to immigration than the law concocted by Sen. Simpson and others -- a law that has transformed the U.S. from a country noted for accepting refugees to one that is now creating refugees. </TEXT></DOC>
