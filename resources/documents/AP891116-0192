Police said six officers were hurt in two clashes.   The South African Transport Services said it fired 800 strikersafter dropping 626 from the payroll earlier this week. The companysaid the walkout is illegal because rail, trucking and harboroperations are designated as essential.   Police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway stationin Germiston, near Johannesburg, when about 50 strikers arrived bytrain for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares.   Officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked withsticks, whips and stones, police said. Strikers scattered afterofficers fired two pistol shots, according to police, who saidthree officers were injured.   An hour later, three more officers were hurt trying to disperseabout 150 strikers outside a union office in Germiston, accordingto police headquarters. No arrests were reported in either incident.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, with which thetransport union is affiliated, said police ``indiscriminatelyattacked'' the workers when they got off the train without paying.   The statement by the congress, the country's largest and mostmilitantly anti-apartheid trade federation, said police ``brutallyassaulted'' the strikers when they fled to the union offices. Theunion said the workers were unable to pay for their train ticketsbecause they were on strike.   The dispute centers on a demand by the South African Railwaysand Harbor Workers for the minimum wage to be increased to $570 amonth from $230. Other issues in dispute are the union's objectionto possible privatization and the company's refusal to officiallyrecognize the union.   The union claims a membership of 40,000 of the total 180,000black workers employed by the transport company.   The strike, which has hit mainly the Johannesburg-Pretoria areaand the port city of Durban, is one of two bitter labor disputesthat show no signs of resolution.   About 6,000 black employees of South African Breweries, thecountry's privately owned beer monopoly, have been on strike forfive weeks.   On Wednesday, the brewery workers' union lowered its wage demandfor the first time, saying it would accept a 32 percent increaseinstead of a 38 percent increase. But management maintained itsrefusal to change its ``final'' offer of a 16 percent raise.   Seven deaths have been linked to that strike.   Police officials also said Thursday that 15 black activists werearrested for participating in an illegal meeting in Alexandra, atownship adjoining Johannesburg. The meeting followed theannouncement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission fora protest march in Alexandra on Saturday.   Organizers hoped 30,000 would join the march to demand newhousing, an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accruedduring a three-year rent boycott.</TEXT></DOC>
