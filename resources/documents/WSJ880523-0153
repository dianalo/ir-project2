Despite Internal Revenue Service data showing that under the 1981 tax bill the wealthiest taxpayers are now paying both more income tax and a larger share of the tax burden, its opponents will still go to absurd lengths to argue that this legislation was unfair. Perhaps high personal tax rates are best understood as a totem of egalitarian ideology. Unfortunately, liberal proponents of high tax rates have never been able to separate their desire to clobber the rich from the actual results of excessive taxation.    The irony in this position is that high tax rates don't really punish the rich, who always seem to find ways to avoid taxation. Instead, the middle- and lower-income groups pay the price -- a higher tax burden -- for indulging the redistributionist desires on the left. Conversely, the across-the-board tax cuts of the 1981 tax bill clearly benefited middle- and lower-income taxpayers the most. Since 1981, the shares of the tax burden borne by middle- and lower-income taxpayers have declined by 14% and 15%, respectively. During the same period, the share of the tax burden paid by wealthy taxpayers rose by 44%.    Sen. William V. Roth Jr. (R., Del.)    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
