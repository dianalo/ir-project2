GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amnesty International today urgedBurma's leaders to investigate alleged brutality by authorities whoquelled riots in which scores of people died.   ``These investigations should lead to the bringing to justice ofthose responsible for human rights violations,'' the London-basedhuman rights organization said in response to a query by TheAssociated Press.   Amnesty International said it was concerned about allegations ofhuman rights violations of demonstrators and prisoners duringunrest in Burma this year.   In recent months, several minor quarrels have turned into majorand bloody anti-government riots.   Western and Burmese sources say riot police in the bloodiestdemonstration, in March, were commanded by Sein Lwin, who this weekwas named president of Burma and head of its sole political party.He replaced Ne Win, who resigned Saturday after 26 years ofauthoritarian rule.   ``They (riot police) and other security or law-enforcementpersonnel have been repeatedly accused of excessive use of forceand acts of criminal negligence resulting in unnecessary deaths andinjury to as many as 200 protesters and prisoners,'' theorganization said in a telex.   The government said that 43 people died in March unrest,including 41 who suffocated in a packed police van as they werebeing driven to prison. Unofficial reports put the death toll atmore than 100.   Amnesty International said steps taken to investigate abuseshave so far proved ``inadequate.''   The organization, which investigates human rights abuses aroundthe world and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said it hasrepeatedly expressed concern about evidence ``of a consistentpattern of political killing, torture and arbitrary detention'' byBurmese security forces operating in ethnic minority areas.   The organization said that still limited information availableincludes evidence that the army and police in Karen, Mon, Kachin,Shan and Arakan states committed ``severe violations of humanrights.''   The Burmese government is waging a decades-old war againstethnic minority groups.   A number of Western diplomats and Burmese emigre groups fearthat the ascension of Sein Lwin, who has a long record of ruthlesssuppression of dissent, will lead to further unrest and toughreprisals by authorities.   ``There are reasons for us to be concerned. Where civildisobedience has augured, Sein Lwin was on the spot and the resultwas killing, maiming and prisoners,'' said Ye Kyaw Thu, generalsecretary of the Committee for the Restoration of Democracy inBurma, in an interview from Washington D.C.   ``We are very concerned that the students will not be able tohold back their frustration, agony and anguish,'' he said.   Sein Lwin commanded troops who put down student unrests in 1962and 1974 and was involved in purges of government officials in themid-1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
