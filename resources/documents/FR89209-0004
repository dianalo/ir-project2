Oliver, Financial Analyst,Office of Economic Development, (202) 653-6986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Public Law 100-590, the Small BusinessAdministration Reauthorization and Amendment Act of 1988 (Act), requiresseveral amendments to SBA's regulations of the development company programs,13 CFR Part 108. (1) Section 115 of the Act emphasizes the Congressional purpose of fosteringeconomic development in rural as well as urban areas. It directs SBA topromote the economic development program in rural areas and to developa plan for greater outreach of procurement and export trade in such areas.This Congressional emphasis is implemented by new paragraph (b) of andSection;108.1 Policy. (2) Section 114 of the Act requires an amendment to andSection; 108.8(d).Section 108.8(d)(4) required, among other things, that the ownership interestsin the small concern, for the benefit of which a property was acquiredby a borrower with the proceeds of an SBA-guaranteed debenture, and theownership interests in such borrower, be completely identical, and remainso until repayment of the loan. The new rule provides that such identityshall not be required of a family group (consisting of father, mother,son, daughter, wife, husband, brother or sister) if SBA determines on acase-by-case basis that the SBA guarantee, the family group ownership andthe loan will benefit the small concern substantially. The second rulepromulgated here amends andSection; 108.8(d)(4) in accordance with this statutorymandate. (3) Section 108.503-4(a) of 13 CFR provided that the proceeds of an SBA-guaranteeddevelopment company debenture or loan could be used to finance constructionof a new facility for an eligible small concern, if the following conditionswere met: (1) Not more than fifteen percent of the space in such projectwould be leased out to third parties, (2) reasonable projections indicatedthat the small concern would need the additional space within three years,and it is not feasible to build an addition in the future. That paragraphalso provided that the small concern may lease out up to 49% of the spacein an existing facility acquired with the proceeds of an SBA-guaranteeddebenture or loan. The new law provides that a small concern may leaseout up to 33% of such a newly constructed facility, if reasonable projectionsof growth demonstrate that the small concern will need additional spacewithin three years and will fully utilize the entire facility within tenyears. The provision governing the lease of space in an existing facilitywas left unchanged. The third rule promulgated here carries out the mandateof Section 116(a) of the Act. (4) The fourth rule carries out the mandate of section 112(c) of the Act,which authorizes SBA to establish a maximum legal interest rate on thebank or commercial lender portion of the development company loan package.This maximum interest rate will override state law and control all legaldisputes. This provision is intended to encourage more section 504 loanmaking authority in states whose usury laws have discouraged banks fromagreeing to the long term commitment which is a prerequisite to the section504 program. This pilot program will be repealed on October l, 1990, unlessCongress and the President decide to extend the authority. An appropriateinsertion is made to andSection; 108.503-8(b)(4). (5) Section 112(a) of the Act, among other things, amends section 504of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 697a, to omit any referenceto a pilot program to sell guaranteed development company debentures toinvestors, and makes this program permanent. Accordingly, the fifth rulerevises andSection; 108.504 (b) and (c) by omitting references to the temporarynature of the debenture sales program as a mechanism for financing theacquisition of fixed assets for small concerns. (6) Finally, section 117(b) of the Act prohibits any United States departmentor agency from linking financial support of a development company witha restriction on the type of small business which such development companymay assist, unless such department or agency provides the entire projectassistance to such small concern, and its restriction is limited to suchsmall concern. The sixth and last rule adds a new andSection; 108.506 whichstates this prohibition.<ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance With Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct and the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>For purposes of Executive Order 12291, SBA has determined that the ruleis not a major rule. SBA estimates that it will make 140 additional loansfor a total of $25 million in rural areas under the first rule. Under thesecond rule we estimate that SBA will make an additional 125 <T3>alter ego </T3>loans to family groups for a total of $50 million. Underthe third rule, we estimate that SBA will make an additional 50 loans fora total of $15 million to construct new business space for small concernswho may initially lease out up to one third to others. Under the fourthrule, we expect to make no more than 20 loans for an aggregate of $8 million.The fifth rule is editorial, and without impact on the national economy.The sixth rule also can have no impact on the economy, since it merelyforbids other Government agencies to interfere with SBA's management ofthe development company program before May 1, 1991, and after such dateforbids development companies to accept funding from any source if suchfunding involves any conditions relating to the types of small concernsto be assisted, or imposes any requirement on the small concerns beingassisted under this program. The total impact of these rules may thus reachat most an aggregate of $98 million per year. SBA is also certain that these rules will not cause an increase in thecosts for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State and local governmentagencies or geographic regions, and will have no adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity or innovation. SBA certifies that these rules do not warrant the preparation of a FederalAssessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612; the only rule withfederalism implications is the fourth rule, amending andSection; 108.503-8(b)(4).That rule tracks section 112(c)(2) of Pub. L. 100-590, and authorizes SBAto preempt the usury laws of any State as they impact on the non-Federalfinancing of a project under this part. As the implementation of the Statute,the provision does not require a federalism assessment under the ExecutiveOrder. Inasmuch as the amendments here set forth do no more than implement statutorilymandated changes to the regulations and because prompt notification tothe public of the changes is essential, notice of proposed rulemaking andpublic comment thereon are unnecessary, and therefore not required pursuantto 5 U.S.C. 553(d). SBA is publishing this rule as a final rule, effectiveimmediately. Since no notice of proposed rulemaking is required by andSection;553, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, specifically 5 U.S.C. 603. There are no additional reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirementsinherent in these rules which would come under the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. There are no federal rules which duplicate,overlap or conflict with these rules. The legal authority for these rule changes is section 5(b)(6) of the SmallBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6) and section 308(c) of the Small BusinessInvestment Act, 15 U.S.C. 687(c). <ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 108 . </ITAG>Loan programs/business, Small Business Administration, Small businesses.Accordingly, Part 108 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 108_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
