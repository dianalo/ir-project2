Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in Docket No. CP89-483-000an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permissionand approval to abandon from interstate service certain existing compression,pipeline and plant facilities, with appurtenances, hereinafter referredto as the ``Terrell Facilities,'' being located in Terrell, Val Verde andCrockett Counties, Texas, and the related service, all as more fully setforth in the application which is on file with the Commission and opento public inspection.El Paso states that the facilities and service were authorized as follows:by order issued December 15, 1960, at Docket No. G-19966, authorizationwas granted to construct and operate, <T3>inter alia,</T3> the Brown Bassett Gathering System and the TerrellPurification and Dehydration Plant (``Terrell Plant''); by order issuedNovember 6, 1980, at Docket No. CP66-306, authorization was granted toconstruct and operate, <T3>inter alia,</T3> the 15-mile J. M. Field to Terrell Plant 24-inch pipeline,the J. M. Field Gathering System, a 24-inch O.D. orifice-type check meter,and additional purification and dehydration facilities; and by authorityof the order issued April 17, 1972, at Docket No. CP72-113, El Paso constructedthe 13,500-horsepower Terrell Field Compressor.El Paso states that the Terrell Facilities have high operating costs. Moreover,it is indicated that El Paso's gas reserves from the Brown Bassett andJ. M. Fields have declined by eighty percent. El Paso states that the costsassociated with the operation of the Terrell Facilities result in an extremelyhigh unit cost because the facilities are now processing only a fractionof the originally designed plant throughput. Additionally, El Paso statesthat the decline in reserves has forced all wells located in the BrownBassett and J. M. Fields to be periodically shut-in or to free-flow gasbecause the Terrell Field Compressor did not have sufficient volumes tooperate. El Paso states that to facilitate the production and transportationefforts of Shell Western Eandamp;P Inc. (Shell) in the proximity of the TerrellFacilities and to resolve El Paso's existing and future take-or-pay exposure,El Paso and Shell entered into a sales agreement dated October 21, 1988,permitting Shell to acquire El Paso's Terrell Facilities.Accordingly, El Paso proposes to abandon by conveyance to Shell: (i) TheTerrell Field Compressor; (ii) the J. M. Field to Terrell Plant pipeline;(iii) the Brown Bassett Gathering System; and (iv) the Terrell Plant. Theapplication states that Shell intends to operate the Terrell Facilitiesas an integrated, non-jurisdictional gathering system. It is indicatedthat Shell has agreed to provide a gathering service (including metering,dehydration and delivery of such gas to El Paso) for El Paso's remaininggas purchase agreements and for others with supplies behind the TerrellPlant.El Paso states that the abandonment of the Terrell Facilities would havea <T3>de minimis</T3> effect upon El Paso's system gas supply activitiesand would have no significant effect upon El Paso's ability to render existingnatural gas service to its customers. Finally, El Paso maintains that therewould be no adverse environmental effects upon the effectuation of theabandonment proposed herein. <T3>Comment date:</T3> January 24, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">2.

Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-470-000]</ITAG>Take notice that on December 21, 1988, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee),P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket Nos. CP89-470-000and CP88-522-002 an application pursuant to section 7 of the Natural GasAct for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Tennesseeto restructure its sales and transportation services and to be compensatedfor maintaining the gas supply needed to provide firm sales service tocustomers which choose such service, all as more fully set forth in theapplication which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.Tennessee states that the service restructuring proposal will allow itsfirm sales customers to revise their current entitlements to sales servicefrom Tennessee by electing service from among Tennessee's existing andproposed new sales and transportation services and to know in advance theprice for Tennessee to acquire and maintain long-term firm gas supply fortheir benefit. Tennessee contends that the restructuring is necessary torestore balance between Tennessee's responsibility to provide merchantservice and the customers' responsibility to pay for the gas supply requiredto provide that service. To accomplish the service restructuring, Tennesseeproposes to establish a two-part gas pricing formula under which firm salescustomers will pay a gas demand charge and a gas commodity charge basedon an index of published spot prices.Tennessee states that the key features of its restructuring proposal areas follows.(1) Tennessee proposes to maintain its existing CD and GS rate schedules.Customers which elect to continue service under those rate schedules wouldretain their conversion rights under andSection; 284.10 of the Commission'sRegulations.(2) Tennessee proposes to establish new Rate Schedules CDS and SGS forcustomers that want to restructure their service entitlement by electingany combination of daily and monthly firm sales entitlements within theircurrent entitlements.(3) CDS and SGS customers could elect standby sales service for up to 50percent of their firm sales entitlements. In this regard, Tennessee, indicatesthat the subject application would amend Tennessee's application pendingin Docket No. CP88-522-000 wherein it had proposed a standby service.(4) A customer electing a zero firm sales entitlement would convert allof its prior firm sales entitlement to firm transportation.(5) Tennessee requests authority to automatically abandon any firm salesentitlements relinquished by its customers in favor of the transportationservice.(6) Tennessee proposes a two-part gas pricing structure for its CD, CDS,SGS and partial requirements GS customers. The customer would pay a GasDemand Rate of $7.00 per month per dekatherm of firm sales entitlementand a Gas Commodity Rate no higher than the average of an index of reportedspot prices adjusted for fuel and losses. Full requirements customers purchasingunder Rate Schedule GS would pay a one-part rate comprised of demand andcommodity components derived from the CDS demand and commodity rates. IfTennessee increases the Gas Demand Rate or establishes a higher ceilingon the Gas Commodity Rate, the customers could renominate their firm entitlements.(7) Tennessee proposes to eliminate the Purchased Gas Adjustment provisionof its tariff and to direct bill the balance. In Account No. 191 as wellas any future billing adjustments pertaining to periods prior to the effectivedate of its gas restructuring plan. Tennessee also proposes to directlyreimburse the customers for any supplier refunds related to the prior periods.(8) Tennessee would continue to provide firm and interruptible transportationunder its Rate Schedules FT and IT, respectively, but proposes to eliminatethe five receipt point limit on the number of receipt points a customercan include in its firm transportation contract. Tennessee proposes toestablish limits on the capacity that a converting customer can obtainthrough each of Tennessee's supply area mainlines to reflect the designcapacity of its system and Tennessee's firm capacity requirements. Therewould be no limits proposed on firm entitlements for conversion customersto transport through Tennessee's market area mainline. (9) (a) Tennessee proposes to eliminate Rate Schedule G and to grandfathermost G customers as eligible for service under Rate Schedule GS or SGS.(b) Tennessee proposes to eliminate Rate Schedule E for emergency serviceand states that emergency service can be provided under its sales rateschedules, including Rate Schedule R. (c) Tennessee proposes to revise the rate for service under Rate ScheduleR to reflect the 100 percent load factor rate design recently requiredby the Commission and to eliminate any rate discount for an AQL-restrictedcustomer that elects a monthly firm sales entitlement under Rate ScheduleCDS or SGS which is below the monthly component of its AQL. <T3>Comment date:</T3> January 24, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-484-000] </ITAG>Take notice that on December 23, 1988, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation(Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP89-484-000an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificateof public convenience and necessity authorizing the establishment of DeliveryPoint Entitlements (DPEs) on Transco's system, all as more fully set forthin the application which is on file with the Commission and open to publicinspection. Transco requests authority to establish DPEs applicable to each deliverypoint and Facility Group on its pipeline system for all firm service customersother than customers under Transco's Rate Schedules G and OG. Transco statesthat over the past several significant changes in the pattern of customers'takes have occurred and have resulted in shifts of deliveries among deliverypoints, as well as in increased peak hourly rates of delivery relativeto the total daily deliveries on Transco's system. As a result, Transcoasserts that the flexibility which has been designed into Transco's pipelinefacilities to accommodate fluctuating delivery rates and load shiftingamong delivery points is being taxed to the limit, and further shifts couldthreaten the integrity of firm deliveries to customers. Transco statesthat it is proposing to implement its DPE procedures which formalize thebasis upon which the pipeline system was designed and is capable of operating.To determine the individual delivery point and Facility Group DPEs, Transcostates that it has reviewed the design capacity of its facilities and analyzedactual daily deliveries for each delivery point and Facility Group forfive summer and winter periods. For purposes of the study, Transco statesthat it utilized a five-year period commencing May 1, 1982 and extendingthrough April 30, 1987. In conducting the analysis, Transco states thatthe goal was to compare the design capability of Transco's facilities withactual maximum deliveries that Transco had historically delivered to eachindividual delivery point during the five summer and winter periods describedabove. In addition, Transco states that actual maximum deliveries weremeasured against the contracts and service obligations Transco has withits customers. As a result, Transco states that it has determined thatthe actual maximum volumes (firm and interruptible) delivered to the variousdelivery points and Facility Groups under normal design operating conditionswere consistent with customers' firm contract entitlements and the designof Transco's facilities. Therefore, based on its analysis, Transco statesthat the maximum deliveries, the customers' contractual entitlements andthe design of the pipeline facilities were compatible and consequently,each of these criteria were utilized to determine the applicable DPEs.Transco asserts that its DPE proposal would not change its current operatingpractices, but will continue to provide customers with requested deliverieswhich are in excess of the DPEs to the extent physical operating conditionspermit such deliveries and Transco is able reasonably to determine thatsuch deliveries will not impair Transco's ability to provide firm serviceto other customers. Transco states that under its DPE proposal, customerswill continue to nominate deliveries as they always have and, to the extentcapacity exists, Transco will continue to schedule and deliver the requestedvolumes even in excess of the applicable DPEs. However, Transco notes thatthe proposed DPEs provide for some measure of deterrence (i.e. a penalty)to better assure that customer takes_over which Transco has no control_willnot cause operational problems that will threaten the integrity of Transco'sability to maintain firm deliveries. Therefore, Transco proposes that tothe extent a customer, without Transco's consent, unilaterally takes orrefuses to cut-break its takes of gas at levels in excess of the DPEs,a penalty may be imposed pursuant to the provisions of the proposed DPEtariff sheets. Transco states that the proposed DPE procedures and thespecific DPEs proposed for each delivery point and customer are set forthin detail in the pro-forma tariff sheets contained in the application.<T3>Comment date</T3>: January 24, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of the notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">5.
