These amendments prescribe the method and degree of stockholderapproval necessary to qualify a plan under sections 423 and 422A.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Current Stockholder Approval Requirements  </ITAG>For a stock option plan to qualify either as an employee stock purchaseplan under section 423 or as an incentive stock option plan under section422A, the plan must be approved by the stockholders of the corporationwithin 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted. The regulationsunder section 423 provide that the stockholder approval must comply withall applicable provisions of the corporate charter and bylaws and the lawof the State of incorporation. In addition, they provide that an employeestock purchase plan must be approved at a duly held stockholders' meetingand that the stockholders voting in favor of the plan must hold a majorityof the outstanding voting stock of the corporation.  The temporary regulations under section 422A do not address the stockholderapproval issue generally, but proposed regulation andSection; 1.422A-2(b)(2)would permit stockholder approval in any manner consistent with applicableprovisions of the corporate charter, bylaws and applicable State law prescribingthe method and degree of approval for the granting of incentive stock options.In the absence of such a prescribed method and degree of stockholder approval,the proposed regulations would require an incentive stock option plan tobe approved by a simple majority vote of stockholders, voting either inperson or by proxy, at a duly held stockholders' meeting.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>This document amends the regulations under sections 423 and 422A to provideuniform rules relating to stockholder approval. Stockholder approval ofeither an employee stock purchase plan or an incentive stock option planmust comply with all applicable provisions of the corporate charter, bylawsand applicable State law prescribing the method and degree of stockholderapproval required for the issuance of corporate stock or options. If theapplicable State law does not prescribe a method and degree of stockholderapproval in such cases, then the plan must be approved either (a) by amajority of the votes cast at a duly held stockholders' meeting at whicha quorum representing a majority of all outstanding voting stock is, eitherin person or by proxy, present and voting on the plan, or (b) by a methodand in a degree that would be adequate under applicable State law in thecase of an action requiring stockholder approval. For this purpose, anaction requiring stockholder approval is an action on which stockholderswould be entitled to vote if the action were taken at a duly held stockholders'meeting. Thus, if the applicable State law provides that an action mustbe approved either by majority vote of the stockholders at an annual orspecial meeting or by the written consent of stockholders, the action isone that requires stockholder approval and approval of the action throughthe use of either procedure is adequate.Although the amendment of the regulations under section 423 was not thesubject of a notice of proposed rulemaking, the issues considered in connectionwith this amendment were the subject of a notice of proposed rulemakingunder section 422A (LR-279-81, 49 FR 4504 (February 7, 1984)). For thisreason, and because the amendment provides a less burdensome standard forstockholder approval than the current regulations, the Service has concludedthat it is not necessary to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemakingwith respect to the section 423 amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inconsistent Rulings</ITAG>In Revenue Ruling 75-256, 1975-2 C.B. 194, the Service ruled that a stockholderapproval requirement identical to the requirement in the current regulationsunder section 423 was not satisfied when votes were cast by stockholdersholding 40 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation,and the plan was approved by 80 percent of the votes cast, because theplan was not approved by stockholders holding a majority of the outstandingvoting stock of the corporation. In Revenue Ruling 80-29, 1980-1 C.B. 94,the Service ruled that a stockholders' meeting is not required when, inaccordance with State law, a corporation's qualified stock option planor employee stock purchase plan is approved by unanimous written consentof the stockholders of the corporation, but that a stockholders' meetingis required if there is less than unanimous written consent by the stockholders.Under the amended regulations, the stockholder approval requirements ofsections 423 and 422A may be satisfied even if (a) the stockholders votingin favor of the plan hold less than a majority of the outstanding votingstock, or (b) the plan is approved by written consent that is less thanunanimous. Accordingly, the Service will not follow Revenue Rulings 75-256and 80-29 in determining whether the stockholder approval requirementsof sections 423 and 422A are satisfied, and the portion of Revenue Ruling80-29 that deals with section 423 will be revoked.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that these rules arenot major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis is not required.A general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553for temporary regulations or for final regulations to which 5 U.S.C. 553(b) does not apply. Accordingly, the temporary and final regulations donot constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. Chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Michael J. Grace of the Officeof the Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), withinthe Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service.
