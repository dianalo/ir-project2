Some Channel One critics expected the controversy that eruptedover a program that enables companies pitch products in theclassroom would scare off advertisers.   But Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville, Tenn.-basedmedia concern that created Channel One, said in an interview that``some people have overestimated that issue.''   The daily Channel One television shows are scheduled to beginnext March, and Whittle Communications has been lining up sponsorsfor the past three months.   Several national education groups and state education officialsin New York and California have vehemently opposed Channel One, andsome cable networks have begun offering ad-free alternatives for usein schools, notably a 15-minute daily news show carried on TurnerBroadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network.   Whittle said Friday that advertisers want to buy time on the12-minute news shows not only because it gives them access to anoften hard-to-reach audience of young teens, but to help schools.   Revenue from the two minutes of ads on each Channel One show willbe used to pay the costs of producing the daily news program,providing two companion educational network services and equippingeach participating school with dozens of television sets, asatellite dish and two videocassette recorders.   Whittle said five companies have signed ``firm, non-cancellable,multiyear contracts'' that will generate $51 million in ad revenueduring the first year of Channel One programming _ or 56 percent ofthe first-year goal of $90 million.   He said those commitments indicate Channel One's revenue willexceed that of any cable TV network during its first year inbusiness.   Including the first year's revenue, the contracts would generate$149.7 million in ad revenue over the first four years of ChannelOne, he said.   Whittle declined to identify any sponsors, but said they includedfour who had been in a seven-week test of the Channel One service insix schools last spring as well as one newcomer.   None of several of the Channel One test sponsors questionedFriday indicated whether they would advertise on it next spring.   Procter andamp; Gamble Co., which advertised two brands of shampoo,potato chips, deodorant and acne medication in the Channel One test,is ``still evaluating the program,'' said spokeswoman KellyGillespie at the consumer product giant's Cincinnati headquarters.   Levi Strauss andamp; Co., the jeans maker from San Francisco, and Wm.Wrigley Jr. Co., the gum maker from Chicago, have made no finaldecisions, spokesmen said.   Hans Fiuczynski, a spokesman for Mandamp;M-Mars in Hackettstown, N.J.,said, ``We do not discuss our future plans'' with the media. Thecompany pitched Mandamp;Ms and Snickers candy during the Channel One test.   The Channel One producers are giving advertisers a chance to bethe exclusive sponsor in 15 different product categories startingnext spring.   Whittle said the five companies already signed have locked upeight of those product categories. The value of the multiyearcontracts, which run either three or four years, ranged from $13million to $53 million, he said.   Whittle took several steps this summer to indicate that it ismaking progress toward getting Channel One in operation.   It signed a $150 million contract with Philips ConsumerElectronics Co., based in Knoxville, Tenn., to make, install andmaintain the video system in the schools. It named a panel of 12luminaries led by former Education Secretary Terrell Bell to advisethe Channel One programmers.   Earlier this month, Whittle began an intensive effort towardsigning up schools for the program.   Whittle declined to say how many schools have signed up, but saidhe is confident that the targets of 1,000 schools at launch and8,000 by December 1990 will be reached.</TEXT></DOC>
