SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, releasing thePentagon's annual assessment of Soviet military might, saidWednesday that Congress should not impose spending cuts ``inanticipation of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union.''   The secretary warned that the Soviet Union continues tomodernize its armed forces and will remain the world's largestmilitary power even if Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev makesgood on his promised cutbacks and pledges of reform.   ``In sum, we now find a Soviet Union which retains enormousmilitary power, the only nation still capable of threatening thevery survival of the United States,'' Cheney said at a Pentagonbriefing. ``Prudence, therefore, dictates that we maintain ourdefenses while we wait and see about Soviet developments.''   Cheney issued the report, ``Soviet Military Power,'' as Congressdebates Pentagon spending cuts.   The Senate on Tuesday voted to trim President Bush's Star Warsprogram by $800 million, a move that could spell the first annualbudget reduction in the space-based, anti-missile shield.   ``Congress seems determined to want to take cuts in the defensebudget in anticipation of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union,'' Cheneycomplained during his meeting with reporters.   The secretary said that in the midst of ``all the hope andoptimism'' about prospects for arms accords and a less threateninginternational environment, Americans must remember ``the UnitedStates faces a more formidable offensive strategic arsenal thanwhen Gorbachev came to power.''   He said Congress should go along with the president's requestsfor Star Wars, the B-2 Stealth bomber, the submarine-launchedTrident missile and a mobile missile force in order to counterSoviet improvements.   At the White House, Bush said Cheney's message was ``goodadvice'' for both the administration and Congress.   ``He's saying don't do something dumb. Don't make the mistake ofunilaterally disarming _ knocking out significant strategicmodernization programs at the very minute that the Soviet Union isgoing forward,'' Bush said in an Oval Office exchange withreporters.   The annual study, which in its early editions under the Reaganadministration was derided on Capitol Hill and outside governmentas an overblown estimate of the Soviet military's effectiveness,has evolved amid the changing U.S.-Soviet relationship.   Now sprinkled among its 159 pages are a photo of Gorbachevgarnering support for his reforms at a Communist Party Conference,a picture of ethnic demonstrations in a Baltic Republic and asnapshot showing Adm. William Crowe Jr. and Soviet military leaderGen. Sergei Akhromeyev reviewing troops at the Pentagon.   Whereas previous volumes made references to Soviet intentions ofworld domination, the new volume notes that the likelihood forconflict between the superpowers ``is as low as it has been at anytime in the postwar era.''   But it also portrays the Soviets as an extremely formidable foefacing a United States that ``grapples'' with such things as theselection of a mobile missile force.   Cheney insisted that the first version of the publication to beissued on his watch was an attempt to be fair and accurate aboutthe threat the United States faces.   ``My point here today is not to in any way be critical of thereforms efforts we see Mr. Gorbachev undertaking,'' Cheney said,adding that the Pentagon has been ``extremely supportive'' of themove to engage the Soviets in the arms control arena.   Cheney called the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan a``significant development.'' It is pictured on the cover of thereport.   The report also cites Gorbachev's announcement of significantcuts in conventional forces, reductions in the Soviet defensebudget and weapons procurement, and the U.S.-Soviet arms controlagreement on banning intermediate-range missiles in Europe.   Cheney said he'd like to see Gorbachev's announced intentionsenacted, as well as continued U.S.-Soviet efforts to reduceconventional arms in Europe, reach a treaty on strategic nuclearweapons and increase military-to-military exchanges.   The secretary announced that next week he intends to play hostto Soviet defense minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov during a week-longvisit to the United States.   Among other Soviet military developments, he cited:   _Despite Gorbachev's announced 14.2 percent reduction in Sovietdefense spending, outlays since 1985 have increased by an averageof 3 percent a year in real terms.   _The Soviets are deploying a new, silo-based SS-18intercontinental ballistic missile with 10 warheads each while theycontinue to field 170 SS-25 road-mobile missiles and some 18rail-mobile SS-18s.   _The Soviets have augmented their strategic ballistic missilesubmarine force by launching the sixth units of the Typhoon andDelta IV-class submarines.   _While the Soviets are unilaterally withdrawing some groundforces opposite NATO, they are reorganizing and modernizing theirgeneral purpose forces, upgrading their communications networks andresearching future generations of weapons systems.   _Even though a ``significant trend'' was sighted of lessenedSoviet naval operations in waters far from the homeland, new majorsurface combat ships were added to the fleet.</TEXT></DOC>
