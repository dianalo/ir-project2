This publication announces the adoption of Draft8 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standardfor Shell and Application Utility Interface for Computer. Operating SystemEnvironments (IEEE 1003.2/POSIX Shell and Tools) as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard (FIPS) on an interim basis. IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8 definesa command language interpreter and a set of utility programs. It is foruse by computing professionals involved in system and application softwaredevelopment and implementation and is part of a series of specificationsneeded for application portability.

Federal Information Resources Management Regulation 201-8.1, FederalADP and Telecommunications Standards.b. FIPS 151, POSIX: Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments.<T3>Objectives</T3>. This FIPS permits Federal departments and agenciesto exercise more effective control over the production, management, anduse of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives ofthis FIPS are:a. Promote portability of computer application programs at the source codelevel.b. Simplify computer program documentation by the use of a standard portablesystem interface design.c. Reduce staff hours in porting computer programs to different vendorsystems and architectures.d. Increase portability of acquired skills, resulting in reduced personneltraining costs.e. Maximize the return on investment in generating or purchasing computerprograms by insuring operating system compatibility.Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespreadavailability and use of comprehensive and precise standard specifications.<T3>Applicability</T3>. This FIPS should be used for command language interpretersand utilities that are either developed or acquired for Government usewhere POSIX-like interfaces are required. This FIPS is applicable to theentire range of computer hardware, e.g.:a. Micro-computer systems.b. Mini-computer systems.c. Engineering workstations.d. Mainframes.<T3>Specifications.</T3> The specifications for this FIPS are the specificationscontained in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standardfor Shell and Application Utility Interface for Computer Operating SystemEnvironments, IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8 (POSIX_Shell and Tools) as modified below.IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8 defines a command language interpreter and a set ofutility programs. IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8 refers to and is a complement todraft IEEE Standard 1003.1-1988, POSIX.This FIPS makes the following modifications to IEEE Standard 1003.2, Draft8:1. The implementation must support the C Locale (see IEEE 1003.2/Draft8, Section 2.6).2. The xd (hexadecimal dump) utility is not required.3. Application Installation Utilities specified in Chapter 5 are not required.4. The ``-v'' option of the cc utility (Section 9.1) is not required tooperate as specified in IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8.5. The shell features listed below are not required. This modificationof the requirements of IEEE 1003.2/Draft 8 has been made to minimize theimpact of changes between Draft 8 and the final version of IEEE Standard1003.2.a. Operators (( )).b. Reserved words [[ ]].c. Substring expansions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">$(nameandplusmin;pattern) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">$(name%pattern) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">$(nameandplusmin;andplusmin;pattern) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">$(name%%pattern) d. String length expansion $(andplusmin;name).e. Command substitution syntax $(command).f. Multi-digit positional parameters.g. Built-in commands alias, typeset, and unalias.h. Test operators -nt, -ot, and -ef.i. Assigning values with export and readonly.j. Symbolic names for signals and traps.k. Separation of positional parameters expanded from $* and $@ by the firstcharacter of the IFS. Only the capability to separate parameters by a spaceis required.l. Functions.m. Function option -f for the unset command.<T3>Recommendations.</T3> Users of this standard should be aware that itdoes not require the Shell and Tools interface to be implemented on a FIPS151 conforming implementation. Users should also be aware that certainutilities and functions are optional in IEEE Standard 1003.2. To providethe greatest support for application portability, it is recommended thatan implementation conforming to this FIPS also provide the following features:1. A FIPS 151 conforming applications interface.2. The UUCP protocol and utilities as specified in Appendix C of IEE Standard1003.2/Draft 8.3. Software Development Utilities Option (Chapter 7), when software willbe developed on the systems being acquired.4. C Language Bindings Option (Chapter 8).5. C Language Development Utilities Option (Chapter 9), where softwarewill be developed in C on the systems being acquired.6. FORTRAN Development Utilities Option (Chapter 10), where software willbe developed in FORTRAN on the systems being acquired.<T3>Implementation.</T3> This standard is effective <T3>6 months after publication in the </T3><T4>Federal Register</T4>. The other elements identified in the Appendixshould be considered in planning for future procurements.a. <T3>Acquisition of a Conforming Portable Shell and Application UtilityInterface.</T3> Organizations developing applications which are to be acquiredafter the publication date of this standard and which have applicationsportability as a requirement should consider the use of this FIPS. Conformanceto this FIPS should be considered whether the operating system environmentsare:1. Developed internally,2. Acquired as part of an ADP system procurement,3. Acquired by separate procurement,4. Used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or5. Specified for use in contracts for programming services.b. <T3>Interpretation of the FIPS for Shell and Application Utility Interface.</T3>NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding the FIPS specificationsand requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questionsabout the interpretation of this FIPS should be addressed to: Director,National Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: POSIX Shell and Tools FIPSInterpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg,MD 20899.c. <T3>Validation of Conforming Operating Systems Environments.</T3> NISTis developing cooperatively with industry a validation suite for measuringconformance to this standard. This suite will be available for testingconformance of POSIX Shell and Tool implementations.<T3>Where to Obtain Copies:</T3> Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,Springfield, VA 22161.
