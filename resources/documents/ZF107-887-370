Is working atyour PC hazardous to your health?andP;  At first sight that question may seemsilly: no rivers or bays have been spoiled by PC data spills; no communitieshave been rendered uninhabitable by toxic memory dumps; no species have beenendangered by the random killing of files.andP;  In short, although themanufacture of PCs involves environmentally sensitive chemicals andtechnologies, if any product can be regarded as safe to be around and use,the personal computer would be it.andM;Yet doubts persist.andP;  Clusters of miscarriages have been associated withcomputer use; headaches and eye problems have been attributed to working atterminals; and even the dread word cancer has been whispered by researchersas a potential computer-related health problem.andP;  Since the PC itself ishardly eight years old, questions about the effects of long-term use areimpossible to answer definitively.andP;  And studies to date can be cited thatprovide reassurances of safety and point to potential problems with PCs andother electrical devices.andM;The possible PC hazards stem not from toxic chemicals, but from a potentialnemesis more insidious and invisible: electromagnetic radiation, or EMR.andP;  EMRpossesses the qualities of the perfect poison in an Agatha Christie novel: itis colorless, odorless, tasteless, and after it does its deadly work, itvanishes without a trace.andM;Figure 1 shows the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation--not all of which isbad.andP;  Sunlight is one form of EMR and is vital to life itself.andP;  Moreover, theinfrared rays that warm your toast, the microwaves that cook your lunch, theradio and TV signals you tune in every day, and the X rays that help diagnoseailments are all examples of beneficial electromagnetic radiation.andM;At a high enough exposure level, however, all forms of EMR are dangerous.andP;  Xrays are known to cause cancer, and last summer's media campaign forsunscreens alerted everyone to the dangers of ultraviolet radiation.andO;Infrared radiation can burn or even sear flesh.andP;  Microwaves can cook livingcreatures from the inside out and have been implicated in causing cataracts.andO;Even lower-frequency radio waves have the potential for roasting you and haverecently been found to cause more subtle biological changes--possibly evencancer.andM;At some point, then, beneficial forms of electromagnetic radiation cross theline and become health hazards.andP;  When it comes to computer safety, thequestion is where PCs and video display terminals (VDTs) fit in the continuumfrom good to bad.andP;  Any equipment that generates EMR has the potential forcausing health problems.andP;  Does personal computer equipment pose such hazards?andM;To help you answer this question for yourself, in preparing this PC LabNotes, we not only surveyed much of the available literature on the subject,but also enlisted PC Labs and a number of outside experts.andP;  We conductedextensive tests, making actual measurements of suspect emanations from anumber of monitors and computer systems.andM;Anecdotal evidence is easy to find but impossible to assess.andP;  Anyone who getsa headache after a long day at the office can blame his or her PC, and no onecan prove him or her wrong.andP;  And since the history of the PC's use in theoffice is so short, the fact that no suspiciously large number of itsmillions of users have mysteriously passed away on the job can't clear it ofsuspicion.andM;Moreover, all the potential hazards of PC use may still not be known or evensuspected.andP;  Supposedly benign technologies and products often prove to haveunexpected and dire side effects long after they have become accepted incommerce and everyday life.andP;  It took more than four decades before thedangers of asbestos in building materials became widely known, and effectiveregulations on it were slow in coming.andP;  Civilizations have risen and ebbed,all the while being ravaged by deadly toxins of their own making, becausethey did not understand the mechanisms through which the problems werecaused.andP;  The lead pipes that carried much of the Roman water supply are acase in point.andP;  The possible health effects of extremely low frequencyradiation--a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is emitted by PCs--aretoday as unknown and mysterious to the public as were the toxic properties oflead plumbing two millenia ago.andM;Fortunately, we can justifiably add the more than 30 years of experiencegained with computer VDTs to our knowledge base for PC health effects.andP;  PCsand VDTs share the same technologies.andP;  Both rely primarily on cathode-raytubes in monitors for displaying information, for example.andP;  Since bothtechnologies use signals of approximately the same frequencies, they generatemany of the same EMR components.andP;  The essential difference is that PCs add abox containing high-frequency (strictly defined, signals in the range from 3to 30 MHz) data processing circuitry on your desktop; with VDTs, theprincipal high-frequency electronics are remotely located.andM;Even adding our experience with VDTs is of limited value, however, fordespite decades of research, no consensus on the safety of VDTs (and thus,personal computers) has emerged.andP;  The conflicting results of studies havelined up two opposing parties, each of which is unlikely to be swayed by thearguments of the other.andP;  On one side are the makers of electronic equipmentand the organizations that employ the people who use it.andP;  This group believesthe equipment is safe.andP;  On the other side, many of the people who actuallywork at VDTs and personal computers all day long have their doubts.andP;  It's theclassic employer-employee struggle with a technological twist.andM;The employee viewpoint, however, is buttressed by a variety of studies thatshow biological effects of electromagnetic radiation and an associationbetween VDT use and health problems.andP;  The most notable of these problems isthe alleged increased risk of miscarriage.andP;  For example, a 1988 study by M.andO;K. Goldhaber, M. R. Polen, and R. A. Haitt of 1,583 pregnant women innorthern California showed that those who used VDTs for more than 20 hoursper week had a significantly higher incidence of miscarriage.andM;On the other hand, VDT makers and employers rally a whole range of otherstudies (many of which they have funded) that have failed to find any suchrisk.andP;  At a conference on VDT safety in Montreal in September 1989, aUniversity of Toronto study of 800 pregnant mice subjected to electromagneticfields of the kind given off by VDTs suggested that there's no relationshipbetween spontaneous abortion and VDT electromagnetic fields.andM;While that may be good news if you're a pregnant mouse, pregnant humanworkers may not be reassured.andP;  And that's the problem.andP;  As in any scientificdiscipline, the VDT studies are subject to interpretation.andP;  Moreover, thehuman VDT studies are correlational rather than causal--they can associate aproblem with VDT use but cannot prove a true cause-and-effect relationship.andO;The EMR from the computer terminals could be causing miscarriages, orsomething else about the terminals or the way a particular study wasconducted could have influenced its results.andP;  For example, the 1988California study cited above includes an admission that its results may havebeen confounded by unmeasured workplace factors such as poor ergonomics andjob-related stress.andM;Stress rather than radiation is, in fact, a prime contender for the cause ofhealth effects associated with VDT use.andP;  At the same Montreal conferencenoted above, Rosalind Bramwell of the University of Manchester presented astudy of nearly 4,000 female workers in Britain that indicated that increasedstress among VDT users leads to an increase in the number of menstrualproblems.andM;On the other hand, a growing number of studies have found cause-and-effectrelationships between EMR and biological changes in tissues grown underlaboratory conditions.andP;  Some of the effects occurred when the tissues weresubjected to electromagnetic fields of the same nature as those created bypersonal computers and VDTs.andM;The contradictions between the various studies may well give you the feelingof having both feet firmly planted in midair.andP;  While PC Labs can't get intoembriological and epidemiological research, we did carefully measure thevarious electromagnetic emissions from personal computer equipment, whichshould help you put the various possible EMR risks in perspective.andP;  We'vecorrelated these measured values with the values that have been foundhazardous in scientific studies.andP;  Although no claim can be made as to whetherPCs are dangerous or safe, based on the PC Lab's findings, you'll at leastknow what your worries may be and what you can do about them.andM;EXAMINING X RAYSandM;X-radiation is perhaps the most publicized danger connected with equipmentbased on cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology.andP;  CRTs include television picturetubes, oscilloscopes, radar screens, and computer monitors.andP;  Many early colortelevision sets did indeed emit prodigious amounts of x-radiation, and thesimilarity between a color TV screen and a color computer monitor is all tooobvious.andM;The mechanism by which X rays cause cancer is well understood.andP;  X rays are aform of ionizing radiation.andP;  That is to say, the photons that make up theX-ray signal contain sufficient energy to break up the chemical bonds inmolecules--including those of the DNA in chromosomes.andP;  Once the DNA in a cellhas been changed, the genetic code of the cell is altered.andP;  The cell may dieimmediately, or it may just subtly change its activity.andP;  When a mutant(altered) cell replicates, however, the changes in it are passed on to itsprogeny.andP;  If these changes affect the growth control mechanism of the cell,it and its offspring may multiply rapidly and uncontrollably as cancer.andM;The chances that any one cell will react to X rays in such a way to causecancer are minuscule.andP;  However, given enough rays reacting with a sufficientnumber of cells, the cancer potential becomes real and worrisome.andM;The concern that ultimately caused the federal government to issue strictregulations on the x-radiation emitted by television sets (and computerterminals) had a very real basis.andP;  Certain television sets in the early 1960semitted X rays of such strenth, you could make a radiograph of the bones inyour hand using the television set as an X-ray source!andM;How did they do it?andP;  One of the many ways that X rays can be produced isthrough a rapid deceleration of electrons.andP;  When the electrons slow down theymust give up energy and (depending on their momentum) some of this energy isemitted as X rays.andM;Early television sets used a vacuum-tube high-voltage rectifier to generatethe current that drives the electron beam in the display tube and a similiartube, the shunt regulator, to maintain a constant voltage on the screen.andO;These tubes were themselves essentially miniature X ray generators:  theyfunctioned by passing a huge electron flux from the tube's cathode to itsanode, where the electrons were rapidly decelerated.andP;  X rays were emitted inthe process.andM;Not all television sets even of that early vintage were so dangerous,however.andP;  In fact, the culprit proved to be defectively manufacturedshunt-regulator tubes, which did not properly shield their anodes.andP;  Theresult was the emission of a concentrated, pencil-like beam of X rays throughthe bottom of the television set.andP;  Unless you had the television resting onyour stomach--unlikely in those days of hundred-pound monster TVs--you wouldhave been safe from its effects.andM;Moreover, vacuum-tube high-voltage rectifiers and shunt regulators have longbeen obsolete.andP;  They've been replaced by solid-state silicon diodes that emitno x-radiation.andP;  (Electrons go through no rapid deceleration in silicondiodes.)andP;  Since no known PC monitor uses vacuum tube rectifiers, thex-radiation problem in PCs from that source is nonexistent.andM;However, all CRT-based devices do have another potential source of X-rayemissions.andP;  Every CRT creates its image by shooting a ray of electrons at thephosphors that coat the inner face of the screen.andP;  When they strike thephosphors, these electrons decelerate rapidly.andP;  Most of the energy from theelectron beam goes to excite the phosphors, which in turn emit the visiblelight of the image.andP;  Some of it, however, can generate X rays, and the higherthe voltage inside the tube, the larger the X ray flux.andP;  Color tubes, whichoperate at potentials as high as 30 kilovolts, produce thousands of timesmore x-radiation than do monochrome tubes, which operate below 20 kilovolts.andO;(X-ray emissions increase by about a factor of ten for every one kilovoltincrease.)andM;ARE THESE X RAYS DANGEROUS?andM;Probably not.andP;  x rays are classified into two types.andP;  Low-energy, or soft Xrays, have wavelengths from 0.01 to 1 nanometer (a nanometer is a length ofone billionth of a meter), and have little penetrating power.andP;  High-energy,or hard X rays, have wave-lenghts shorter than 0.1 nanometer, and can passthrough and interact with the human body.andP;  Medical X rays are hard, andbecause hard X rays can cause cell damaage, the government has placed strictlimits on exposure to them.andM;The electrons in the beam of a CRT have littel energy and can produce onlysoft X rays.andP;  This radiation is effectively absorbed by the glass of the CRT.andO;Although a CRT looks relatively simple--hardly more than an oddly shapedglass bottle with some metal pins sticking out its narrow end--it's actuallya very complex creation.andP;  Indeed, the CRT is believed to be the mostcomplicated consumer product made before the advent of the micro-processor.andO;Rather than one uniform kind of glass, tube is crafted from severalvarieties, each tailored to a specified purpose.andP;  The wide face of the tubeis thick--sometimes as much as one-half inch.andP;  It's made from glasses rich instrontium and lead, which block the soft X-ray emissions and keep them withinthe tube.andM;Regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration set a maximumlimit on X-ray emissions from television sets and terminals alike of .5milliroentgens per hour, measured at a distance of 5 centimeters from thescreen.andP;  That's about 2 inches, which would be very close watching indeed.andO;Devices with greater emissions are not permitted to be sold in this country.andO;Moreover, the measurement of x-radiation under this standard must be madeunder worst-case conditions.andP;  Not only must all controls on a television setor terminal being tested be advanced to the position that maximizesx-radiation (settings at which the set is unlikely to be operated), but alsofailure conditions that would result in the worst possible X ray emissionsmust be simulated.andP;  (for example one must check the effect of the failure ofa voltage regulator, which would increase the potential of the CRT electronbeam.andP;  The simulation conditions often result in the catastrophic failure ofthe equipment during the test.)andM;Compliance testing by the FDA has found cases of excessive X-ray emissionsfrom computer terminals.andP;  For example, a 1981 study found that roughly oneout of 12 VDTs evaluated emitted x-radiation above the0.5-milliroentgen-per-hour ceiling.andP;  The problems were confined to 8 unitsout of 91 and represented three different models.andP;  These out-of-compliancemodels were either recalled to be modified to comply with the emissionsrequirements or were not permitted to be sold on the U.S.andP;  market.andM;To find out where PC equipment stands today, PC Labs measured the X-rayemissions of several popular computer monitors, including an IBM monochromedisplay, the IBM Color Display (CGA), the IBM Enhanced Color Display (EGA),the IBM Model 8503 monochrone VGA display, the IBM Model 8513 color VGAdisplay, the Compaq VGA display, and three NEC MultiSync models (II, 2A, and3D).andP;  The X-ray emission measurements were made in PC Labs by a certifiedhealth physicist.andP;  During testing, the monitor screens were fullyilluminated, with all controls advanced to their maximum positions.andP;  Themeasurements were made at the specified distance of 5 centimeters from thescreen.andP;  Under these conditions, the measurements are believed to representworst-case X-ray emissions in normal operation of the equipment.andP;  (We did notsimulate the abnormal conditions induced by component failures.andP;  However,this normally is required for full FDA-compliance testing.)andM;The results of our tests revealed no measurable x-radiation from any of thedisplays.andP;  In that the threshold limit for detection of the equipment used(the same equipment specified by the FDA regulations) was .2 milliroentgensper hour, X-ray emissions from this equipment was at least two and half timeslower than the federal guidelines.andM;These measurements suggest that any fears you have about x-radiation fromyour computer monitor are unfounded.andM;UNDERSTANDING ULTRAVIOLETandM;Ultraviolet radiation is part of sunlight--a growing part, thanks to thediminishing ozone layer in the stratosphere.andP;  Its name describesit--ultraviolet is the invisible component of sunlight beyond the violet endof the spectrum.andP;  It has shorter wavelengths (180 to 400 nanometers) andhigher frequencies than visible light.andP;  Physically, that means thatultraviolet photons are more energetic than those of visible light.andP;  In fact,the ultraviolet spectrum spans the transition range between ionizing andnonionizing radiation.andP;  UV photons can be energetic enough to causechromosomal damage, and UV has been implicated in causing cancer.andO;Ultraviolet radiation also triggers the skin's protective tanning reactionand can burn the skin, as every sunbather knows.andM;Unlike X rays, however, ultraviolet rays are not penetrating.andP;  The thickatmospheric blanket of ozone stops them quite well; a thick blanket ofcotton--or even a thin shirt--does quite a good job.andP;  Consequently, theeffects of ultraviolet on the human body are limited to the places thatsunlight can reach: the skin and the eyes.andP;  Today, it is generally agreedthat exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancers, cataracts,conjunctivitis (irritation of the lining of the eye), keratis (inflammationof the cornea), pain, and light intolerance.andM;Moreover, current evidence indicates that UV exposure is cumulative.andP;  Thatis, the longer you bathe in its rays over your lifetime and the stronger therays, the greater the chances of unfavorable consequences.andP;  It is alsobelieved that exposure early in life has a greater effect than laterexposure.andM;All computer monitors emit some UV along with the visible light of theirimages.andP;  However, the most energetic--and thus the most dangerous--UVwavelengths cannot escape the CRT.andP;  Ordinary glass strongly absorbsultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than about 350 nanometers.andO;The only part of the UV spectrum that may be present in CRT emissions is inthe range of 350 to 400 nanometers.andP;  (Some sources list the beginning of UVradiation at 380 nanometers.)andM;To determine whether UV emissions of computer monitors might pose anypotential health hazard, the same computer displays used to test x-radiationwere measured for UV output.andP;  These tests were conducted by HoffmanEngineering Corp., an independent contractor experienced in spectralmeasurements, under the supervision of PC Labs.andP;  All emissions from 350 to780 nanometers (at intervals of 5 nanometers) were measured, again with allmonitor controls at their maximum setting and the screen fully lit.andM;The results showed that some ultraviolet emissions were generated by all ofthe displays tested.andP;  The emission level declined with decreasing wavelengthand was virtually absent in most cases at wavelengths shorter than our350-nanometer test limit.andP;  The worst emissions came from the IBM 8503monochrome VGA display; the spectra of all color displays were so similar asto imply that they all used the same phosphors--perhaps even the same CRTs.andO;In all cases, however, ultraviolet emissions were far lower than emissions inthe visible light spectrum.andP;  Typically, UV emissions were no more than 5percent of the level of the maximum emissions in the visible band.andM;To put these measurements in perspective, Figure 2 compares the results ofselected screen displays with the measurements of a &quot;deluxe cool white&quot;fluorescent tube--the kind often used in office lighting.andP;  Its UV emissionsmeasured about 20 percent of its maximum visible-spectrum emissions.andP;  Basedon typical monitor brightness levels and on office lighting levels mandatedby OSHA, CRT emissions of ultraviolet radiation would be a fraction (in therange of one-quarter) of the level reflected from a white sheet of paper on adesktop when the monitor is operated under the test conditions (brightnessand contrast advanced fully, screen fully lit).andP;  In normal operation,ultraviolet emissions from a monitor would be substantially less.andM;From these measurements, the modest ultraviolet emissions of computermonitors would appear to be safe.andP;  If UV in the range 350 to 400 nanometersis hazardous, office fluorescent lighting likely represents many times thedanger presented by the typical computer monitor.andM;THE MICROWAVE MENACEandM;Microwave energy--which cooks food in microwave ovens and blasts radar beamsover the horizon--has well-documented effects on living cells.andP;  A potato or apoodle in the microwave oven will both cook, and the mechanism is wellunderstood.andP;  The microwave signal excites water and fat molecules,transferring its energy to them as thermal energy (heat).andP;  Food is cooked bymicrowaves because the heat induced in the food accumulates faster than itradiates away, raising the temperature.andP;  Cell proteins break down astemperature increases.andP;  Cells die.andP;  The food is cooked.andM;Microwaves penetrate moderate distances through living tissue.andP;  Consequently,organs inside a body can be heated (potentially killed) by microwave beams.andO;The thermal energy of microwaves is also known to cause cataracts.andM;Wavelengths longer than microwaves (those typical of VHF television, FM, andstandard broadcast radio signals, for example) can also produce thermaleffects by transferring energy to materials.andP;  These longer wavelengths,however, are less reactive with biological tissue; they tend to penetratewithout being absorbed.andM;Aside from thermal effects, microwave and other radiation in the radiospectrum (that is, higher in frequency than about 30 kHz) is not thought topose health hazards.andP;  While some studies have implicated microwaves incausing cataracts, most of these have been at intensities that cause thermaleffects.andP;  (Cataracts caused by non-thermal microwaves have been reported,although the preponderance of studies have found the contrary.)andM;Microwave and other radio-frequency heating requires very strong signals.andO;Microwave ovens operate at levels of hundreds of watts.andP;  For this reason, PCLabs did not measure emissions in the microwave or radio frequency spectrum.andO;All computer equipment must already be certified to abide by subpart B(formerly subpart J) of part 15 of the Federal Communications Commissionrules and regulations.andP;  These regulations set interference standards that areorders of magnitude below the radiation levels necessary to achieve thermaleffects.andP;  The health standards deal in volts per meter, whereas the FCCinterference standards limit emissions to microvolts per meter.andM;Moreover, PCs do not directly create microwave energy.andP;  Although microwavesare theoretically created as harmonics of the signals generated inside thecomputer, the level of such harmonically created microwave signals isessentially unmeasurable.andM;It is possible that there are nonthermal microwave effects that may be activeat lower signal levels.andP;  If these effects are real, they are believed to be aresult of low-frequency modulation of the microwaves.andP;  Such modulationeffects would be similar to the effects of direct radiation at such lowerfrequencies, as discussed below.andM;DANGEROUS ELVESandM;At the very bottom of the electromagnetic spectrum is extremely low frequencyradiation.andP;  Technically, ELF (as I'll abbreviate extremely low frequencyhereafter) comprises the frequency range from 30 hertz to 300 Hz.andP;  In commonusage, however, the term is extended to include any frequency below 30,000Hz,and so includes the 20 to 20,000-Hz frequency range of your stereo system.andO;As are all frequencies below 450 kHz (450,000 Hz), ELF is ignored in the FCCcertification process.andP;  ELF has long been thought innocuous, but a number ofrecent newspaper and magazine articles have raised doubts about its safety.andM;Strictly speaking, the ELF of concern is not radiation but captive electricand magnetic fields that are generated by strong electric currents in powersystems, appliances, and other electrical equipment (including computers andtheir peripherals).andP;  The two types of fields--electrical and magnetic--arerelated and arise from the same phenomena, but they have individualdistinguishing characteristics.andP;  Electric fields generate a potential (avoltage), are measured in millivolts or volts per meter, and are relativelyeasy to shield against by using conductive materials.andP;  (The wire braidingshields the center conductor from electric fields in coaxial cable, forexample.)andP;  Magnetic fields generate a current (amperage).andP;  These fields aremeasured in milliamps per meter or sometimes in related units of gauss, andare difficult to shield against.andM;A number of recent studies have correlated the strong ELF fields associatedwith power lines and electrical distribution systems with increased cancerrisk.andP;  Electric blankets and water bed heaters have also been implicated.andO;The photo on the left in Figure 3 shows pulsed ELF waveforms generated bycomputer equipment--the same kind that has demonstrated biological effects inthe laboratory.andP;  These effects include changes in cell membrane permeability,altered prenatal development, and the promotion of the growth of cancerouscells.andM;ELF research to date has been of two types: laboratory studies made on cellcultures and animal tissues; and epidemiological studies--that is, researchthat attempts to find a common link between the backgrounds of sick people.andM;The epidemiological studies of power distribution systems have mostlycorrelated illnesses with the exposure to ELF fields.andP;  The results of thesestudies to date have been mixed.andP;  The most recent, however, have been aimedat answering the criticisms made of earlier studies that had found a positivecorrelation between childhood cancers and conditions in which large ELFfields are present.andP;  (The fields themselves were not measured.)andP;  In theUnited States and Sweden, correlations between cancer and strong ELF fieldsassociated with electrical distribution systems have been found, althoughcontradictory studies have also been published.andM;In the laboratory, the potential biological effects of ELF at levels belowthose that would cause tissue to be heated have been extensively investigatedfor about the last decade.andP;  The results of that research are beginning toshow that far from being innocuous and noninteractive with biological tissue,ELF electrical and magnetic fields can be subtly active--with both beneficialand harmful effects.andM;On the positive side, ELF fields are used in treating bone fractures; thefields apparently promote bone growth and hasten healing.andP;  On the downside,ELF fields also appear to promote the growth of cancerous cells.andP;  ELF fieldshave had demonstrated effects on the calcium channel permeability of cellmembranes.andP;  This can affect a variety of cell functions, including thetransmission of electrical signals in nerve tissue.andP;  Again, ELF fields havebeen shown to affect protein synthesis and alter circadian rhythms.andP;  Researchhas also shown that developing nervous systems may be particularlysusceptible to ELF fields, and that these effects may be latent, showing uponly in specific situations or at later times.andM;Not all of these dire reports have stood up to scrutiny, however.andP;  Attemptsto replicate the results of some of the studies have failed.andP;  And, of course,since these lab studies were carried out in vitro, there is no guarantee thatthe effects on human beings would be identical.andP;  Nonetheless, a consensus isemerging that ELF fields can be biologically active at levels lower than wereonce thought possible.andM;One of the things discovered about ELF fields is that they do not behave likeionizing radiation.andP;  The fields are not energetic enough at the molecularlevel to change or destroy the chemical bonds in cells; thus, they don'tdamage chromosomes.andP;  Instead, the ELF fields seem to mimic the electricalchanges that normally occur in living cells in the body.andP;  By changing thecalcium permeability of cells, for example, they can change the response of anerve cell to stimulation.andM;This mimicking of normal cellular processes may be at the root of thecancer-promoting potential of ELF.andP;  Some scientists have noted that themembrane sites at which some ELF reactions occur appear to behave asreceptors for cancer-promoting chemicals.andP;  ELF fields also appear to increasethe chemical activity of a compound that is known as ornithine decarboxylase,and this effect has been associated with cancer promotion.andP;  In addition, ELFfields also disrupt the functions of cell gap junctions--another effect thathas been associated with cancer growth.andM;Some studies of ELF fields have encountered an anomaly that complicatesresearch, however.andP;  Normally, chemical carcinogens and ionizing radiationseem to act in an essentially linear way.andP;  That is, the dangers of eachincrease as the exposure level increases.andP;  While a number of ELF effectsexhibit a similar intensity relationship, some studies have found what arecalled window effects.andP;  That's to say, some of the biological effects occuronly at certain ELF field strengths (or frequencies) and not at higher orlower values.andP;  Additionally, these window effects appear to depend on thepresence and orientation of static field, like the earth's magnetic field.andO;Thus, for example, one study (by C.F.andP;  Blackman, S.G.andP;  Benane, D.E House, andW.T.andP;  Joines) on chick brain tissue showed changed in calcium ion flux with60-Hz ELF fields at field strengths of 35, 40, and 42.5 volts per meter.andP;  Atfield strengths of 25, 30, and 45 volts per meter the same 60-HZ ELFradiation had no effect.andM;For health scientists, even the possibility of window effects is worrisome.andO;If these effects are real (and doubts persist in many scientists' minds thatthey are), they would preclude the developmet of exposure standards.andP;  Theeffects of ELF fields would vary with the individual, because the size andshape of one's body affects the strength of voltages and currents inducedinside it by the ELF fields.andM;To complicate matters further, the waveform associated with ELF fieldsappears to affect their biological effects.andP;  Least active appear to be thesinusoidal waves that are characteristic of utility-supplied electricity.andO;The most active appear to be pulsed fields like those generated by radar andfields with sawtooth waveforms, which are characteristically generated by thesweep circuitry of television sets and monitors.andM;PC Labs measured both the electrical and magnetic fields generated by severalpopular system units (these included an IBM PC-XT; IBM PC AT; Compaq Deskpro386/25; and IBM PS/2 Models 30, 50Z, and 60) as well as the monitors wetested for other emissions.andP;  Measurements were made with sensors optimizedtfor two particular frequencies; those near 60 Hz, which are characteristicof power lines and the vertical scanning signals in monitors; and those inthe range 10 to 40 kHz, which are characteristic of switching power suppliesand the horizontal scanning circuitry of monitors.andP;  Measurements were made atfour distances (6, 12, 18, and 24 inches) and from each side of each unit.andO;At total of 80 measurements were made for each unit tested.andM;Detectable magnetic and electric fields in the lower frequency range werefound with both computers and monitors.andP;  Higher-frequency fields were nearlyabsent in the measurements made of computer system units.andP;  As shown in thesidebar &quot;The ELF Fields of Two Popular Displays,&quot; the strongest low-frequencymagnetic fields were found above and on the left side of most monitors,although the IBM 8503 monochrome VGA display also had a strong field on itsright side, and the NEC MultiSync had strong fields on both sides.andP;  Theweakest fields in nearly every case were measured at the front of the unitundergoing evaluation.andP;  The field strength declined with increasing distance.andO;At a distance of 24 inches in front of the system units, field strengths wereat or near the background reading of the test area.andP;  Monitors had fields thatwere sometimes pronounced at 24 inches, particularly at higher frequencies(The University of Toronto mouse study, which found no effects from VDTfields, concerned itself exclusively with these higher-frequency fields).andM;To put these observations in perspective, however, we found that thebackground magnetic field strength at 60 Hz at most locations in PC Labsexceeded the fields were measured 12 inches in front of most system units andthe fields 18 inches in front of most monitors.andP;  This background field seemsto originate in the ceiling wiring associated with the fluorescent lightfixtures (it wasn't the tubes theselves, for the strength of the field didnot decline when the lights were switched off).andP;  Thus, to judge on the basisof field strength, if you work more than 18 inches from your PC and itsdisplay, office wiring may pose more of an ELF threat than does yourcomputer.andM;The fields associated with computer equipment may nonetheless be biologicalyactive, however.andP;  At normal working distances with some equipment, electricfield strength appeared near the level at which an increase in ornithinedecarboxylase activity was found in some studies.andP;  In another study, asimilar field intensity was found to alter the cytotoxicity of T lymphoctyesthat specifically attack cancer cells in mice.andP;  Again, however, it must beemphasized that background fiels present in the office were also observed atthis intensity.andM;On the other hand, at distances greater than 6 inches, the stregth of theelectric fields associated with any of the tested equipment fell well belowthe field strengths found active in the Blackman study that found windowingeffects.andP;  The magnetic fields measured appeared to weak to induce in thehuman body the fields observed to be active in the Blackman study.andM;To summarize, then, PC Labs did measure ELF fields at levels that somestudies have associated with biological effects.andP;  Except at distancesinappropriately close to the equipment, however, these fields proved to be nostronger than the background fields in an office environment.andP;  If PCs pose anELF risk -- and if, indeed, there are any ELF risks -- they are likely notthe only source you'll encounter in your work.andM;THE NAGGING QUESTIONandM;Are PCs safe?andP;  As far as x-radiation and ultraviolet are concerned, normalcomputer use probably poses no particular hazards.andP;  With regard to ELFfields, the situation is more equivocal.andP;  The effects of ELF fields have onlyrecently become accepted by the scientific community, and field strengthsthat are or are not safe have yet to be determined.andP;  It may not be possibleto determine safe ELF levels because of window effects.andM;If, based on the current state of research, you believe ELF fields aredangerous, you can take steps to minimize your exposure to them.andP;  Forinstance, sit in front of your computer and display, where the ELF fields arethe weakest.andP;  Avoid sitting near the sides (particularly the left side) ofnearby computer monitors.andP;  Because both the magnetic and electric ELF fieldsgenerated by computer equipment fall off quickly with increasing distance,you an minimize your exposure by working as far from your computer and itsdisplay as you can without having to squint or strain to reach what you need.andM;Monitors emit more ELF than do computer systems, and this radiation appearsto be related to the scanning signals used by their CRTs.andP;  You can avoid thefield associated with scanning signals (which may be more dangerous than themore pervasive sinusoidal waveforms) by using a display based on analternative technology, such as an LCD display.andM;It's unlikely that your computer will kill you.andP;  Even if the worst of theeffects attributed to ELF prove true, it's likely that you face greaterhealth risks from other forms of pollution, such as the cigarette smoke youinhale (either your own or that of co-workers the cholesterol in yourblood-stream, and the peanut butter you spread on your noontime sandwich.andM;Are the health risks of PCs and VDTs worth worrying about?andP;  Judge foryourself.andP;  But remember: stress is a likely cause of some of the healtheffects that have been related to computing, and worrying about it mayincrease your stress level.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
