DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gruntal andamp; Co. executive Robert Chestmanwas sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading andperjury and ordered to pay about $250,000 by a judge who wanted``to send a message to Wall Street.''   ``His actions corrupted the marketplace,'' said U.S. DistrictJudge John Walker Jr., ignoring pleas for leniency Tuesday from theex-stockbroker and his attorney.   ``Those who cheat the markets out of greed must pay a price fortheir conduct,'' the judge said.   Chestman, 41, put his chin on his folded arms and his wife,Susan, sobbed as Walker passed sentence.   A former Gruntal first vice president from the Long Islandcommunity of Lawrence, Chestman was convicted March 14 by a federalcourt jury of all counts in a 31-count indictment.   Walker, who could have sentenced Chestman to a maximum fiveyears in prison on each count and fined him as much as $500,000,also ordered him to pay about $250,000 in restitution, the finalamount to be determined by the Probation Department and the U.S.attorney's office.   Chestman was convicted of making more than $250,000 in illegalprofits in November 1986 by trading Waldbaum Inc. stock with insideinformation that the New York-area supermarket chain was about tobe sold to rival chain Aandamp;P.   According to evidence at trial, Chestman obtained the non-publicinformation from one of his clients, Keith Loeb, who was related bymarriage to Waldbaum president Ira Waldbaum. Loeb avoidedprosecution by agreeing to testify for the government.   In addition to 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts ofmail fraud, Chestman also was convicted of a single perjury countfor lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 1987about his insider dealings with Loeb.   Noting the perjury conviction, Walker dismissed defense lawyerElkan Abramowitz's claim that Chestman's illegal activity was ``onesingle aberrational incident.''   ``This was not a single occurrence. This was an ongoingsituation,'' said Walker, adding: ``He then compounded his crimes''by lying to the SEC.   Abramowitz asked Walker to sentence his client to ``almostanything but straight jail time.'' Noting that Chestman was underpsychiatric care and was his family's sole support, the defenselawyer added that Chestman not only lost ``a well-paying job, butmore importantly, he's lost his career.''   Under the terms of his conviction, Chestman will be barredpermanently from the securities industry.   In a choked, sniffling voice, Chestman asked Walker to belenient because ``the agony and the pain that my wife and mychildren and my mother and myself have suffered is unimaginable.''   Chestman remained free without bail pending appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
