On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, advanced 17 centsMonday to settle at $17.66 per barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale pricesfor unleaded gasoline increased 0.39 cent to 52.73 cents pergallon, while heating oil moved up 0.51 cent to 47.98 cents pergallon.   Analysts said the market was bolstered by European forecaststhat OPEC would have to boost production in the months ahead tomeet demand later this year.   Those reports said production by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries would have to increase to 19 million barrelsper day, from the current 18 million.   ``If we don't have an increase in production, we'll have anextremely tight and volatile market through the second half,''observed Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Baker said the strong move in outer-month contracts confirmedthe market's bullish tone. Contracts for September delivery of WestTexas Intermediate, for example, traded 31 cents higher than theJune contract.   Worries about continuing hostilities in the Persian Gulf alsohelped pull prices up, the analysts said. Iraq reported its 12thattack on an Iranian tanker in 18 days on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
