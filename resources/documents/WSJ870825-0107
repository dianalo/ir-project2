However, PNC isn't ruling out making New Jersey acquisitions, said Roger Hillas, chairman of both PNC and Provident National. &quot;Yes, we're still looking, but the price has to be right,&quot; he said, adding that prices for New Jersey banks have risen to a level of 2.7 to 2.8 times book value, or 16 to 17 times earnings.    Mr. Hillas said the new bank will be funded with about $25 million. He said it will be created from existing loan production and automobile financing businesses which currently have assets of between $350 million and $400 million.    Earlier this month, PNC agreed to purchase Central Bancorp, for $700 million, to enter the Ohio market. At June 30 that was equal to 2.5 times the book value of the Cincinnati-based bank holding company and 13 times its estimated 1987 earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
