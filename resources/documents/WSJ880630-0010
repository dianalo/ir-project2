Taylor in Washington And Gregory Stricharchuk in Pittsburgh </HL><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   The federal government's latest drive to root out corruption in the Teamsters union is drawing skepticism from Teamsters reformers and criticism from some legal specialists.    One of the most controversial aspects of the proposal is that the government seeks to impose control over certain union affairs even before the Justice Department's anti-corruption civil suit against the Teamsters has been heard in court.    The Justice Department on Tuesday filed suit to oust many of the union's top officials and, in the interim, to appoint a court liaison officer with authority to replace with trustees any Teamster local leaders found to be corrupt. A hearing will be held Tuesday on appointment of the officer and on a requested preliminary injunction to bar board members from contact with organized crime figures and to bar defendants in the case who have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes from participating in union business.    The suit alleges the union's 18-member board has deprived 1.6 million Teamsters of their rights by allowing itself to be corrupted by organized crime.    Three of the 18 board members -- all of whom are defendants in the suit -- are convicted felons and two are under indictment, including President Jackie Presser. Weldon Mathis, the Teamsters' general secretary-treasurer who is running the union in Mr. Presser's absence for medical reasons, has condemned the move as a &quot;vicious anti-labor tactic.&quot;    The government's strategy is similar to instances where trustees have been imposed on corrupt union locals. But the proposal to monitor administration of an entire international union appears to raise much more complicated questions.    The liaison arrangement appears modeled after one set up early this month for Roofers Union Local 30-30B in Philadelphia. Robert Welsh, a former prosecutor operating as liaison officer, said it appears to be working &quot;pretty well.&quot;    But Arthur Fox, a lawyer who represents Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a group seeking direct election of top union officials, expressed concern about the power that would be wielded by the court-appointed officer.    The proposed liaison officer would have power to impose trusteeships on locals and remove union officials without proving the need in a court, Mr. Fox said. &quot;That's much worse, a much greater threat to the autonomy and welfare of the union at a subordinate level&quot; than a trustee in charge of the national, he asserted.    Ken Paff, a spokesman for the group in Detroit, says it could take four years before leadership of the Teamsters would be dislodged by a government trustee. As a result, he said it is impossible to say how quickly there might be any impact from the government's suit.    He noted that the Provenzano brothers ran Local 560 in Union City, N.J., for four years while the government pursued legal efforts and eventually placed a trustee in control. And organized labor already has put together a campaign to fight a takeover of the union. &quot;So I don't think Weldon Mathis should have to jump out of his chair,&quot; Mr. Paff said. &quot;He's going to be there for a while.&quot;    His group will oppose a trusteeship for the international union, he said, in favor of court-ordered supervised voting for at least several elections. &quot;We don't want a trustee. It's dangerous and impractical.&quot; Supervised voting, he said, would clean up the Teamsters &quot;without heavy-handed intervention.&quot;    The government's civil suit, filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, aims to oust the current board and install a trustee to ensure a &quot;free and fair&quot; election of new leadership. But Teamster dissidents doubt whether they could successfully challenge the international's leaders under the union's current indirect officer-election system.    Officers elected by Teamster locals automatically become delegates to the international's conventions, and local officers typically are chosen long before conventions. That makes it hard for members to rally behind a slate for national office, Mr. Fox said.    John M. Mazino, president of Teamster Local 24 in Akron, a backer of the current union leadership, predicted that if the government succeeds in taking over the international that Teamster locals might disassociate themselves from the parent, which he says is too large and decentralized for a trustee to run.    Under the government's plan, the union, though continuing under the leadership of the current executive board, will be policed by a court liaison officer -- probably a lawyer. The officer will focus on investigating and disciplining corrupt Teamsters -- a duty, the government alleges, the 18-member board has ignored.    Ultimately, the government hopes through the court to establish a permanent injunction against organized-crime involvement in union affairs.    The government's suit &quot;is a totally unwarranted intrusion into labor law where there exists enough regulation,&quot; said Irwin Bluestein of the New York law firm Vladeck, Waldman, Elias and Engelhard.    Lewis Kaden, a lawyer who teaches labor law at Columbia University, said lumping guilty and innocent Teamsters leaders together under the RICO statute &quot;runs the risk of guilt by association.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
