Messages are an example of a type of data structure encounteredin generic data translation. Our objective is to provide a system thatthe nonprogrammer can use to specify the nature of translations fromone type to another. For this reason we selected a visual interface thatuses interaction techniques that do not require a knowledge of programmingor command languages. The translator must accomplish two tasks: createa mapping between fields in different message types that specifies whichfields have similar semantic content, and reformat or translate dataspecifications within those fields. The translations are accomplishedwith appropriate, but different, visual metaphors. 14 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
