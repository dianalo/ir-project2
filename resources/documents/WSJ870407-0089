Boston was the runner-up pick. But after butting heads with government regulations and a couple of what-me-worry bureaucrats at its preferred sites, IKEA settled instead on a location in suburban Philadelphia.    State and local governments do handsprings when an industrial colossus such as Toyota or General Motors goes shopping for a a new factory site. For all the competition between localities for jobs and new business, however, the expansion plans of lower-profile companies sometimes slip through the economic-development cracks. In IKEA's site-selection case, Philadelphia's hustle proved as important as location and demographics.    IKEA (pronounced eye-KEY-ah) isn't exactly a corporate nobody. It has stores in 18 countries, including nine in Canada. Sales world-wide last year were $1.7 billion. IKEA designs and sells solely from its own stores a wide range of inexpensive furniture and accessories. Most items come boxed and must be assembled at home. With festively designed warehouse showrooms that include day care for kids and inexpensive restaurants featuring Swedish meatballs, the company has a reputation for marketing pizazz.    FROM ITS CANADIAN BASE, IKEA ogled the U.S. market, especially the West Coast. &quot;People looked at our products and said, 'Why aren't you in California?'&quot; recalls Bjorn Bayley, the president of IKEA's North American operations. Two young executives were sent south. They found problems.    California, for example, is the only state with a standard for flammability in upholstered furniture. Since IKEA manufactures its chairs and sofas to a single world-wide standard, selling in California would mean revising specifications of all upholstered goods at added cost to the consumer of up to 15%, the company estimated.    California at the time was also one of a dozen states with a &quot;unitary-tax&quot; system that taxed multinational corporations on their global profits rather than on the earnings of local subsidiaries. &quot;We're a privately owned company with a lot of things we didn't want to explain to the Californians,&quot; Mr. Bayley says.    IKEA's scouts, he says, &quot;spent three months in Los Angeles, returned to headquarters tan and healthy and said: 'We think we should open on the East Coast.' We kid them about that.&quot;    SWITCHING SIGHTS to the Atlantic Seaboard, IKEA focused on Boston and its huge student population forever seeking inexpensive bookcases and beds. IKEA officials tracked down an economic-development office and received a perfunctory briefing and a folder full of maps and tourist brochures. &quot;We drove around Boston for two or three days and really didn't get a feel for the place,&quot; Mr. Bayley says. The reception in Washington, D.C., the second East Coast choice, was equally cool.    Philadelphia was the last stop. Word of IKEA's interests had reached Greater Philadelphia International Network Inc., a small, business-backed office that tries to lure foreign companies to the area. &quot;For three days we didn't have one minute to ourselves,&quot; Mr. Bayley says. &quot;They booked us into hotels, introduced us to bankers and real estate brokers. We had helicopter tours of the city. Cocktail parties every evening. These people never gave up.&quot;    The Philadelphia area, which spills into Delaware and southern New Jersey, had other advantages: plenty of young, middle-income families and relatively inexpensive commercial real estate. The company, with the network's help, found space in a mall in the suburb of Plymouth Meeting, next to a turnpike exit.    IKEA considers highway access critical since it does no mail-order business, advertises heavily, and expects consumers to find the store without a map. &quot;If you say Pennsylvania Turnpike, Exit 25, they know where it is,&quot; Mr. Bayley says. About 40% of the Plymouth Meeting store's customers are from out of state.    WAS IT WORTH Philadelphia's fuss and bother to recruit IKEA? During its four-day inaugural in June 1985, some 130,000 shoppers went through the store. These days, the store averages about 30,000 customers a week. Last fall, IKEA shifted its North American base from Vancouver, British Columbia, to an office behind the Plymouth Meeting store.    &quot;We saw this not just as a store but as a billion-dollar-plus company that wanted to enter the U.S. and build another billion-dollar company,&quot; says Lee Stull, the Philadelphia network's managing director. &quot;There was the store, headquarters, use of the port, development of a warehouse, contracting for products, exporting those products. Maybe Boston and Washington didn't see that.&quot;    Washington apparently got the word. Last spring, IKEA opened its second U.S. store as the premier attraction in a huge discount shopping center in the capital's Virginia suburbs. Weekend crowds at the Prince William County store are averaging 15,000.    Mr. Bayley says IKEA is looking for sites in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and suburban New York City. &quot;And we still haven't done Boston,&quot; he says wistfully.    IKEA won't hopscotch around the U.S. but plans to move region by region, building half a dozen stores and a warehouse. After the Northeast, Mr. Bayley favors the South or the Great Lakes states. &quot;Chicago must be a hell of a market,&quot; he says.    Then there's Minneapolis-St. Paul with its Scandinavian heritage. &quot;I got a call last year from the governor of Minnesota,&quot; Mr. Bayley says. &quot;I think that showed initiative.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
