 That's why you need textmanagers-a special breed of software-to handle the jobandM;First, let's get one thing straight.andP;  Text managers are the classic &quot;horse ofa different color.&quot; They're a unique breed of database animal, with differentapplications, retrieval power, and methods of use.andP;  They also have animportant place on your software palette, as you'll soon see.andM;Text managers don't have the data-processing power you're used to with adBASE, Paradox or R:BASE.andP;  These database managers, and even flat-filers, areloaded with high-powered options for doing calculations, formatting reports,subtotaling, sorting, and so on.andP;  Text managers have almost none of thesekinds of features.andM;A text manager's main purpose is to find strings of text in large text filesor database collections-and find them fast.andP;  They can also display or printthe retrieved documents or records containing the text strings.andP;  It's whatthey're good at.andP;  It's also about all that most of these programs try to do.andO;Some of the different products add minor flourishes to their word-findingtasks.andM;The usual approachandM;Most &quot;regular&quot; database managers (the ones you usually read about in DataBased Advisor) don't pay much attention to handling text searches-it's simplynot a major concern.andP;  Naturally, you can include text or memo fields thatcontain a paragraph or two of text, maybe more, but quick access to that textis generally a problem.andM;Regular database managers use indexed &quot;key fields&quot; for fast, efficient accessto records.andP;  A limited number of important or logical access points likeACCOUNT NUMBER, PRODUCT NUMBER, or CUSTOMER NAME are selected as key fields.andO;Searches for key-field values are fast, even in extremely large databases.andM;In comparison, searches in non-key fields plod along.andP;  These are&quot;brute-force&quot; string scans.andP;  The computer sequentially searches the text ofevery record or file in the database, looking for the text string.andP;  This cantake several minutes in a large database.andP;  After all, the computer can't stopafter locating the first occurrence.andP;  It can't give a complete report ofoccurrences or failure until it's scanned every bit of the file.andM;Database key fields are small in size.andP;  They generally consist of a singlenumber or term, or at most, a couple of terms.andP;  The reason for this isindexing overhead cost.andP;  Users pay for indexing a key field in two ways.andP;  Thefirst cost is processing time.andP;  Building an index involves complicatedprocessing, sorting, and storing the electronic index and record pointers.andO;Processing time must be expended in batch or real-time indexing.andM;To build an index, you issue the index-building command.andP;  Be prepared to gooff to do something else.andP;  Your computer will chug away for several minutesbuilding indexes to your key fields.andP;  If your database updates key-fieldindexes in real-time, your machine is likely to bog down for several secondswhen you add or modify records and the program updates the indexes.andP;  Tominimize this maintenance time, most database manuals advise you to define aminimum number of key fields.andM;The second major overhead cost is index file space.andP;  This is the program'sinternal electronic record of indexed terms and text location pointers.andP;  Yourprogram builds index files to record this information on disk.andP;  These indexfiles take up disk space.andP;  The more key fields, records, and multiple termoccurrences, and the longer the field lengths, the greater the cost of indexoverhead disk space.andM;Problems and solutionsandM;Microcomputer text database software evolved for the same reasons that itbecame necessary on mainframes and minis-text information overload.andO;Text-oriented database managers originated during the research heyday of thelate 1960s and early 1970s (during the NASA moon project effort).andM;There are three main approaches to text retrieval software on micros.andP;  Ofcourse, as with any effective solution, you pay a price.andP;  The costs varydepending on the approach.andP;  The up-front dollars you spend for text databasesoftware is obvious.andP;  Your choice of approach determines the additional costin disk space, maintenance efforts, and retrieval speeds.andP;  You may need torun batch indexing programs or convert your word processing files intostandard ASCII text format.andP;  Or you might have to import your files into amaster archive text database file.andM;ApplicationsandM;Text searching is a unique approach to information.andP;  It's closer to&quot;information retrieval&quot; than &quot;data retrieval.&quot; Regular database managers aregood at searching for account numbers and logical conditions like &quot;days pastdue&quot; compared to &quot;balance greater than some amount.&quot; They're superb atmeticulous file-keeping, updating records, on-the-fly transactions, andformatting reports.andM;Text managers, on the other hand, excel at finding information matching &quot;whatI mean&quot; or &quot;what I want.&quot; They're the only efficient approach to handlinglarge text fields and extensive document collections.andM;They typically work by building complete &quot;inverted-file&quot; indexes to everymeaningful word in full text.andP;  This allows speedy access to the text.andM;For example, in a text database you can search for and almost instantlydisplay any files or records containing the word &quot;hardware.&quot; If this gets toomany documents for you to efficiently browse, you can easily pare the setdown.andP;  You can use Boolean logical connectors like AND, OR, NOT, and groupingparentheses in your search definition.andP;  You can then search for combinationsof words, like &quot;hardware and inventory,&quot; or complex conditions, like &quot;drillsand hammers and not nails.&quot;andM;Boolean logic also lets you describe the &quot;what I mean&quot; type of information.andO;Using this kind of search, you can describe a pretty specific thought.andP;  Takethis example: (petroleum or oil or fuel or gasoline) and (underground orsubsurface or below-grade) and (storage or tank or container) This may lookcomplicated but it's pretty easy to build on the fly.andP;  All you need to thinkabout are the different parts of the query and group them inside parentheses.andO;The AND, OR, and NOT combination connectors define the &quot;what I want.&quot; It'snot even a big deal if you make a logical or typographical error.andP;  You'reonly searching for the text, not modifying or deleting it.andP;  All you need todo is retype or redefine your query until you get it right.andM;Efficient text access is becoming more and more valuable as we continue inthis &quot;personal automation age.&quot; Common examples of useful text-basedapplications include:andM;* Project research files-These includeandM;lists of sources, notes, results, andandM;drafts.andP;  This information, usuallyandM;gathered with much expense in timeandM;and money, is now at your fingertips.andM;*  Client or patient consultation or sessionandM;notes-Every thought or wordandM;regarding your client is noted andandM;readily accessible.andM;* Litigation support systems-You canandM;access the complicated maze ofandM;documents involved in preparing legalandM;proceedings.andM;*  Professional awareness text files-TheseandM;include notes, downloaded data,andM;correspondence, reports, articles onandM;competitors, advances, and everythingandM;or anything you may be interested in.andM;*  Contractual or legal documentandM;databases-You now have instantandM;access to every word in a file of yourandM;organization's contractual obligations.andM;It works directly with your originalandM;word processed files.andM;*  Statutory or regulatory informationandM;files-Get the full dope on every law,andM;regulation, or tax decision you'veandM;downloaded or collected.andM;Archived text managersandM;Archived databases are another approach to text retrieval.andP;  This kind ofsoftware imports or collects text files into a single large structuredarchive file.andP;  You don't normally keep the separate text files unless youwant to keep the file active.andP;  If you want the extra copy, you pay for it indisk space.andM;Many archival programs use full-text indexing.andP;  These are direct descendantsof earlier mainframe database systems like IBM-STAIRS, DIALOG, and BRS.andO;Instead of using a few indexed key fields, common in single or multiple filedatabase managers, every meaningful word in the text is indexed.andP;  Most ofthese database managers don't index &quot;stop words,&quot; or common words likearticles and pronouns.andP;  They generally let you define or modify stop wordsand provide a default listing of these words.andP;  Your program may simply limitindexing to words four letters or longer.andM;Whatever you use as the index definition, you'll be able to search for,retrieve, and display the full text files using any meaningful word orcombination of words.andP;  The search times are fast.andP;  These programs typicallysearch multi-megabyte text files in just a few seconds.andM;Some archival programs like IZE and AskSam use optimized string-scanningtechniques.andP;  They now rival index programs in retrieval speeds.andP;  Theseprograms have the advantage of eliminating index file disk space overhead andbatch indexing time.andM;Archival database managers remove the convenience of leaving text files intheir original location and form.andP;  They also lessen the chances of mistakenlydeleting or modifying text files that you may have forgotten are indexed.andO;Text archive programs can almost always export or recreate the original ASCIIfile.andM;Text indexing software is at the high end of the text retrieval price scale.andO;First, you invest time and effort for regular batch indexing.andP;  Then, theindex eats up disk space, which may run from 20 percent to more than 100percent of the original file space.andP;  Text index software prices range fromabout $200 to $500.andM;But there is a payoff.andP;  In my opinion, text archives are also at the high endof performance.andP;  You get the fastest, easiest, and most efficient textretrieval with archival programs.andP;  You also get the benefit of formattedreports.andP;  You can print summary reports of the date, title, client, projectnumber, and author fields of all the records that meet your searchrequirements.andM;BiB/SEARCH is a good example of a powerful text archival program.andP;  It hasadvanced text retrieval abilities, index overhead economy, and a nice userinterface.andP;  BiB/SEARCH is being adopted to manage some large internal textdatabase installations.andP;  It's also being adopted as the master filemaintenance and production program by some experienced database publishers.andM;Text file indexing programsandM;Another popular approach to text retrieval is indexed, unmodified normal textand word processing files.andP;  This type of software builds an index to everyword in the ASCII text of regular disk files.andP;  A text file index program canthen search for and display any disk file that's indexed.andP;  For convenience,the original files can remain in regular application directories, like yourword processing directory or modem download areas.andP;  You can also collect theminto special archive or reference-file directories.andM;These programs use the full-text indexing described above.andP;  They can thenefficiently search the indexes to hundreds or thousands of text files anddisplay what they find.andM;ZyINDEX and Lotus Magellan are the high performers in this league.andP;  ZyINDEXis the benchmark for this genre.andP;  It features easy, yet powerful logicalsearching, and fast retrieval speeds (it can search 15M in five seconds on anAT).andP;  It offers user-defined stop-word and synonym lists (it uses synonymlists to search for &quot;means the same as&quot; equivalent words).andP;  ZYINDEX candisplay common word processing format files in native mode; emulate fielddefinitions; and &quot;mark and copy&quot; retrieved text blocks to a 'current notes&quot;ASCII file.andP;  ZYINDEX does require batch indexing and index overhead space,but it gives you the freedom to work with your normal ASCII and wordprocessing files.andP;  You also avoid the chores of defining and maintaining anarchived database file.andM;Lotus Magellan requires very little overhead space.andP;  It can quickly andalmost automatically index your entire hard disk.andP;  It provides very fast textretrieval (it searches a full 32M disk in three or four seconds on an AT).andO;You can use its &quot;fuzzy search&quot; algorithm to quickly locate every disk filebearing the slightest resemblance to your search query.andP;  Magellan supportsnative mode display for about 20 common proprietary-format files.andP;  It candisplay WordStar or Lotus 1-2-3 files, for example, as they'd appear withintheir respective programs.andP;  Magellan also has gateways to many commonapplications.andP;  A function key can instantly call up the program andautomatically load the file you've retrieved in your search.andM;On the negative side, fuzzy searches also mean that you can't accuratelydefine or narrow down what you're looking for.andP;  It isn't possible toaccurately define a search like you can with other text-retrieval software.andO;Magellan is great at finding things you aren't looking for.andP;  It's a maverickproduct.andP;  More a disk manager than an accurate information retrieval tool,it's very handy and fast at what it does, but there's no real control.andM;Quick and dirty scanningandM;Text-scanning software is the &quot;low-priced spread&quot; of text-retrieval software.andO;They scan the entire contents of text files, searching for a specifiedcharacter string or pattern.andP;  Scanning software is like an extension of thesearch feature in most word processors.andP;  Some text-scanning software adds&quot;near-miss&quot; pattern recognition or Boolean logic abilities to augment thesimple string scanning.andP;  Many of these low-end programs simply display filenames and single context lines.andP;  Some of them let you browse through theretrieved text files, and cut and paste text extracts into working documents.andM;Text scanning doesn't offer the fast retrieval speed of full-text indexing.andO;Text-scanning programs read every bit of the text file from the disk andcompare it to the search pattern.andP;  This is a slow sequential search since itsearches the files from beginning to end.andP;  There doesn't seem to be a lot ofprogrammer cleverness that can speed up the scanning.andP;  For example, on a12MHz AT clone, the Golden Retriever text-scanning program found anddisplayed the first document in 13 seconds.andP;  It took about 28 seconds to scanthe entire 220K text subdirectory.andP;  (Golden Retriever continues to scan textin the background, while you examine or browse through the documents itlocated.)andM;These programs display lists or contexts of hits as they're located so theslow scan isn't as tedious as it sounds.andM;Text-scanning software is undeniably slower, but it's also economical in someways.andP;  Costs for scanning programs range from public domain (free) orinexpensive shareware utilities to about $100.andP;  Contrasted with text-indexingprograms, these don't require the time investment for batch indexingsessions.andM;They don't take up index overhead disk space.andP;  Finally, they don't requirearchival database definition and maintenance time.andM;If you don't frequently search large text databases, text scanning softwaremay be enough.andP;  They're useful utilities for retrieving information.andP;  Iexecuted the Golden Retriever search example above, for example, from withinmy Xy-Write word processor, as I wrote the paragraph.andP;  Golden Retriever is myfavorite text-retrieval tool for free-form text files.andP;  It's clean andsimple, like a handy DOS utility.andM;Using text managersandM;So far, we've covered the spectrum of text database tools.andP;  We've examinedvarious approaches, and mentioned possible ways to use them.andM;I also want to emphasize that searching text databases is markedly differentfrom searching techniques used by the standard type of database manager.andP;  Thesearch-language commands and concepts are pretty similar, using logical ANDs,ORs, and NOTs is the same, and so on, but a difference does exist.andP;  Thedatabase is the difference.andP;  It greatly affects the style and approach tosearches.andP;  A text database contains text material in a &quot;natural' language.andO;The content is quite different from normal business-related ordata-processing databases.andP;  The dialect may be formal or informal,journalistic, bureaucratic, or legalese-it doesn't really matter.andP;  Naturallanguages all have similar advantages and disadvantages:andM;* More content = more retrieval opportunities-Text documents or fields havemore or longer words.andP;  You're not restricted to Part Numbers, ItemDescription names, or 20 or 40 characters.andP;  Multiple sentences, paragraphs,and pages mean more words-and more retrieval access points.andP;  Every word is apotential retrieval point.andM;* Vocabulary = more opportunities to miss things-Natural languages are whatinformation specialists call &quot;uncontrolled vocabulary.' We're not limited (orcontrolled) by terms or approved subject headings.andP;  That means things get alot &quot;looser.&quot; Remember your high school English teacher telling you howimportant it was to be creative in your writing? You know: Use active voice,avoid repetition, use synonyms, use metaphors, etc.andP;  Unfortunately, beingcreative makes simple retrieval more difficult.andP;  Using different words tosuggest what you mean makes for more interesting prose, and we all understandit, but it makes database retrieval more difficult.andP;  (Among newspaper textmanagers, for example, the classic example is the news story about a WorldSeries game that never once uses the word &quot;baseball&quot;!)andM;So, in text retrieval you have to consciously use the what I mean search.andO;You can never be absolutely sure you'll find anything when you search forwords or combinations of words.andP;  That means you have to provide lots ofexamples and alternatives to define what you want.andM;The first rule in searching text is: Use lots of synonyms and examples.andO;Don't just use &quot;XYZ Company,&quot; if you're searching a text database filemaintained within the XYZ Company.andP;  Use other common synonyms likely to be inthe business correspondence, notes, contracts, etc.andP;  of that particulardatabase.andM;Try:andM;&quot;XYZ Company&quot; OR XYZ OR companyandM;OR corporation OR organizationandM;But what about all the &quot;false drops?&quot; These are irrelevant documents thathappen to contain the words you looked for.andP;  In our example, you're sure towind up with hundreds of documents !andP;  That's where the second rule comes in:Use logical combinations of groups of synonyms.andP;  Use parentheses to make yourmeaning clear, as in the &quot;underground oil tank' we used earlier.andP;  The AND,OR, and NOT combinations will take care of most of the false drops.andP;  They'llhelp you find what you're looking for.andP;  This &quot;logical search query&quot; is aformal and inclusive way to tell the computer to find what you mean.andP;  You'llget only the documents that relate to XYZ Company and the negotiations for anew parking facility.andM;The futureandM;Right now, the inverted file text index algorithm is thestate-of-the-art-even though it's been around since the 1960s.andP;  There havebeen recent challengers using optimized sequential-scanning techniques.andP;  Someexamples are the mainframe and minicomputer product called Colossus (whichuses specialized hardware for simultaneous multiple scanning), and themicrocomputer product AskSam.andP;  AskSam is a popular product and acceptablyfast for moderately-sized data files-sequential scanning has a bottleneckthat enforces a limit on the capacity of your text file.andP;  Unfortunately, ifit takes n seconds to scan 4M, it's probably going to take 10n to scan 40M,and 100n to scan 400M.andP;  That file-size example isn't outlandish.andM;Full-text database development seems to be headed toward natural languageinput and user-interface improvements.andP;  Many developers are experimentingwith various front ends that can understand and translate natural languagequeries into efficient database queries.andP;  In our example, you could sit downand type, &quot;Get me information about negotiations for a new parking lot forthe XYZ Company.&quot;andM;Another software approach locates and presents documents in the &quot;mostrelevant' order or the most likely to satisfy the user.andP;  An old butreasonably effective approach to this is &quot;ranking.&quot; The software ranks theretrieved documents by the total of successful hits matching the user'srequest.andP;  For example, our imaginary user might see a document with four hitson &quot;XYZ Company&quot; and 11 on &quot;parking.&quot; The next document might have three andsix, respectively.andP;  Golden Retriever and Lotus Magellan use this kind ofranking presentation.andM;Other methods include &quot;weighted&quot; search requests-giving more retrieval weightto unique terms.andP;  For instance, &quot;parking&quot; would carry more weight, since itonly appears 14 times in the entire database, than &quot;XYZ&quot; and &quot;company&quot; sincethey both appear hundreds of times.andP;  This approach is used in interpretingnatural languages.andM;Another interesting development direction is &quot;document-defined searches.&quot;andO;Users might answer &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;N&quot; to the first couple of documents presented inresponse to a search.andP;  In effect, the users are telling the software,  Thoseitems are the ones I'm interested in.&quot; The software then runs a new search,based on the entire contents of the selected documents.andP;  A micro packagecalled SIRE or Personal Librarian does this kind of a document-definedsearch, though only with a single document.andP;  It's a slow process because it'sa brute-force text searching.andP;  The program must identify, weigh, and searchfor dozens or hundreds of words.andM;Lotus Magellan is a promising text retriever.andP;  It has some real developmentpotential.andP;  I don't consider the initial release a serious text-retrievaltool, though the version being worked on may turn the tide.andP;  Right now it'smuch too fuzzy in retrieval definitions, database definition, and reportingpower.andP;  But it's still interesting for several reasons:andM;*  It's fast! Speed is always important to text database users.andM;*  The index size is small.andP;  It's nowhere near the 50 or 100 percent of manyother products.andM;*  It can handle &quot;fuzzy searches.&quot; It gets near-misses, typos, and closespellings.andP;  This is important for near-misses both in the text data and inthe user search definition.andM;But Magellan misses the serious database tool boat in several ways.andP;  It's toogeneral, off on a &quot;DOS shell&quot; wild-goose chase.andP;  Lotus pursued a course offull-disk searches, checking every file, every directory, as a gateway toapplications, navigating subdirectories, etc.andP;  The result: It is powerful butunsophisticated in retrieving text.andP;  The most glaring deficiencies are thatyou can't really define a specific search, specify field locations, or definereal Boolean logic relations.andP;  They went to all that work building terrificindex and access speed and then gave us practically no control over it !andP;  Isuggest and hope that Lotus optimizes Magellan or spins off a better textdatabase product.andP;  DOS shells are a dime a dozen.andM;ASCII text pours in from many sources-and the number of sources increases allthe time.andP;  We download increasing amounts of data from online services likeCompuServe, DataTimes, Dialog, Newsnet, and Nexis.andP;  Text database productsare varied and useful within their growing domain.andP;  As the domain grows,we'll be deluged with more and more text, more disk capacity and CPUs-andbetter text software.andM;Ernest Perez has been a professional librarian for 20 years.andP;  He's currentlya doctoral student in Library and information Studies.andP;  He was the LibraryDirector at the Houston Chronicle and at the Chicago Sun-Times and installedthe newspaper text database at the Sun-Times.andP;  You can contact the authorthrough the Data Based Advisor Readers Exchange, (619) 270-2042.andM;TEXT MANAGERSandM;AskSam, version 4.2andM;AskSam SystemsandM;P.O.andP;  Box 1428andM;Perry, Florida 32347andM;(800) 327-5726, (904) 584-6590andM;$295andM;In an unusual approach, AskSam uses an optimized string-scanning method todeliver response times rivaling the index approach databases.andP;  Result:Afree-form text database with flat-file reporting and calculating power.andP;  Canuse defined fields or on-the-fly contextual field definition (for example,find a desired value following the term &quot;Price:&quot;).andP;  AskSam can producecomplex formatted reports and can even do calculations on data in otherwisefree-form text records.andP;  You can write and store complex commands and macros.andO;A &quot;point and shoot hypertext&quot; feature allows you to search for and displayany other occurrence of a specified term by simply highlighting it in adisplayed record.andP;  Unfortunately, it's marred by a clumsy and complicatedcommand language and syntax.andP;  Mastery of the language requires quite a bit oftime and effort.andM;BiB/SEARCH, version 3.0 andandM;TxT/SEARCH, version 3.0andM;BiB/SEARCH, Inc.andM;P.O.andP;  Box 20503andM;New York, New York 10009andM;(212) 477-4857andM;$195 student, $395 professional, $795 textandM;searchandM;Academic and research-oriented full-text index database.andP;  Natural, easysearch query entry.andP;  Fast, abbreviated command forms.andP;  For example, &quot;d&quot; means&quot;display full record&quot; and &quot;d at&quot; means &quot;display author title.&quot; Text output toscreen, printer, disk file, or even to a new extract database file.andO;BIB/SEARCH offers automatic production of bibliographic citation listings forbook and journal article records, using any of the common bibliographicformats.andP;  Both offer on-line help, online display of full text of usermanual; online demo or tutorial for every command.andP;  Its most impressivefeature is the simple macro language for translating almost any downloadeddatabase file formats into the correct fields of your local PC database.andP;  Themacro language also defines output in any screen, print, or disk file format,and can include control characters.andP;  Features include a powerful text editorfor database maintenance; pull-down/pop-up menus, index browsing, andhighlight bar term selection.andP;  The student version allows 500 records perdatabase, and the professional version has no record limit.andP;  TxT/SEARCHincludes everything found in BiB/SEARCH, plus it supports full-text formattedfields; linked records; 'hyper- links' locate all records containing aspecific word); user- programmable input, and output, format specifications.andM;Concordance, version 4.61andM;Dataflight SoftwareandM;10573 W.

 don't pay muchattention to handling text searches,&quot; he doesn't mention one importantexception.andP;  There is a DBMS that lets you have it all-powerful datamanipulation and text handling-Advanced Revelation (AREV).andP;  The beauty ofAREVs text capability is that it results from its underlying designphilosophy, not from any half-baked add-ons.andM;To see what it can do, let's look at AREV's &quot;out of the box&quot; text managementfeatures in the context of a document archiving application.andP;  Let's say youhave a DOCUMENT table, with a row I.D.andP;  (or record key), DOC_NUM, and columnsor fields named AUTHOR, PHONE, TITLE, TEXT, and ANALYSIS.andP;  The first threecolumns are garden-variety.andP;  TEXT is the complete document, includingformatting, while ANALYSIS is a freeform commentary written by one or morereviewers.andM;Since each row (or record) in an AREV table has a maximum length of 65K, TEXTand ANALYSIS can both run many pages without special provisions.andP;  Since thelength of all AREV columns, including TEXT and ANALYSIS, can vary from row torow, you don't have to reserve space in every row to accommodate the longestoccurring entries.andP;  So the amount of space used is minimized.andM;By specifying AREV Cross Reference indexes on the TEXT and ANALYSIS columns,you can immediately locate the set of documents whose text or analysiscontains any requested Boolean combination of words or word fragments.andP;  Youcan specify standard or custom &quot;stop lists&quot; to avoid indexing words like THE,AND, etc.andM;When you save DOCUMENT rows, you aren't slowed by a long indexing process.andO;AREV indexing is done during the computer's idle time (or, on a network, theidle time of any workstation running AREV).andP;  Since indexing is done at thetable read/write level, indexes are maintained no matter which AREV tool isused to modify the DOCUMENT table.andM;The only constraint is the 65K size limit of each document row, a significantenough restriction these days to justify removing it in a future AREVversion.andM;Entering long text fields from your keyboard is simple because every field inan AREV data-entry window can be expanded to full screen with one keystroke.andO;All entries are done with the facilities of a full-featured text editor.andM;Once you establish the TEXT and ANALYSIS indexes, you can begin look-ups atany data-entry field with a simple parameter entry.andP;  The look-up is initiatedwith one keystroke.andP;  Compound look-ups in more than one index are a standardfeature.andP;  Your searches can be case sensitive or not.andP;  If more than one rowfits the criteria, a pop-up display of all matching rows is presented.andP;  Youcan then choose one or more of the rows.andM;As powerful as it is, AREV doesn't automatically provide every feature of agood text manager; but the powerful set of tools in AREV, along with itsfull-featured programming language, RBASIC, lets you build them quite easily.andM;Context searches aren't built in.andP;  While you can search for documentscontaining combinations of words, you need AREV's symbolic formula orprogramming features to search for phrases.andP;  AREV indexing can find documentscontaining the words &quot;timber&quot; and  wolf,&quot; but you need additional logic toselect only those documents containing the phrase &quot;timber wolf.&quot; You'll alsoneed to do some programming to display the context in which the desired wordappears, instead of just its DOC_NUM.andM;AREV can read, write, and index files in its native formats, as well as DBASEIll PLUS and most delimited ASCII formats.andP;  To handle proprietary textformats like WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, CD-ROM, or documents greater than65K, you can write an AREV Base Filing System (BFS).andP;  BFSs are file driverprograms that interpret AREV table operations with respect to foreign fileformats.andP;  If your needs are extensive enough, the effort it takes to write aBFS is well worth it.andP;  BFSs let AREV applications handle foreign formats justlike the native ones.andP;  There's no conversion involved-and only one copy ofthe data.andM;One caveat: AREV, or any other general tool, will never be as fast at textsearching as a dedicated text manager-especially for small databases.andP;  Inmost situations, this speed difference won't significantly affect itsoperation.andP;  AREV's file management, however, is characterized by access timesthat are relatively insensitive to file size-an advantage when dealing withlarge amounts of data.andM;A notable example of AREV text processing is The IdeaFisher, aword-association system designed to stimulate your thoughts about a problemby creating a trail of related terms and focused questions.andP;  The IdeaFisheris a complex text-oriented application created in AREV (Fisher Idea Systems,phone (714) 474-8111).andM;Why bother to add high-end text-based features to AREV? To combine textbaseand database applications under the most powerful data management environmentavailable !andP;  Advanced Revelation costs $950 and is available from RevelationTechnologies, Two Park Ave., New York, New York 10016, (212) 689-1000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
