This proposal is likely to attract considerable attentionfrom Congress. It comes at a time of rising concern about theshrinking size of the Bank Insurance Fund and the adequacy ofbank regulation. In addition, its recommendations areconsiderably tougher than the regulatory changes proposed bythe Bush administration's banking-overhaul plan. Already,some members of Congress are complaining that theadministration plan, which is designed to encourage banks tohold more capital, doesn't go far enough.   Although the GAO report, entitled &quot;Deposit Insurance: AStrategy for Reform,&quot; also favors high capital standards, itconcludes that &quot;capital deterioration is often a laggingindicator of weakening financial condition.&quot; The report says,&quot;Regulators must act forcefully to control problems evenbefore capital begins declining.&quot;   Under the GAO proposal, which would reduce the discretionthat bank regulators currently have in responding toproblems, regulators would require changes in bankingpractices at the earliest sign of trouble. It would establishfour tripwires that would force regulatory intervention. Thefirst level of response would be triggered by deterioratinginternal controls, increasing interest-rate risk, unusuallyrapid growth or other signs of &quot;unsafe practices in seeminglyhealthy institutions,&quot; the report said.   These banks could be required to tighten procedures orslow loan growth. In anticipation of criticism, the GAOadmitted that such moves &quot;will raise concerns aboutgovernment interference in the marketplace. But nowregulators often don't act decisively on the problems theyfind because the consequences of those problems have yet tohave an adverse financial effect,&quot; the GAO contended.   The second level would be triggered by signs of &quot;seriousasset or earnings deterioration.&quot; In response, regulatorscould require the bank to curb dividends, boost capital, slowasset growth or pay civil penalties, the agency proposed.   Banks would reach the third tripwire when their capitalfell below required levels and would face such requirementsas forced recapitalization, higher deposit insurance premiumsand a suspension of dividends and interest payments onsubordinated debt.   Capital depletion would set off the fourth level ofresponse, the closure or merger of the bank. These changesshould be phased in with tougher accounting standards, theGAO said.   Aside from recommending tighter regulation than theadministration proposal, the GAO would move more slowly thanthe administration on proposals to expand interstate bankingand allow bank holding companies to sell securities andinsurance. Comptroller Charles Bowsher will appear before theSenate Banking Committee on Thursday to discuss the report.</TEXT></DOC>
