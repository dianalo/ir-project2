The commission created Coats, a computerized quote systemfor over-the-counter trading, in 1986 to provide moreinformation about the unlisted stocks, said Pamela Hughes,director of international markets for the OSC.</LP><TEXT>   However, the commission decided it was inappropriate for asecurities regulatory body to run the system. The transitionis expected to be completed by the end of January.   Ms. Hughes said Coats is similar to Nasdaq in the U.S.,though on a much smaller scale. About 1,000 companies,including many speculative resource stocks, are listed onCoats. In 1990, 326.8 million shares valued at 381.9 millionCanadian dollars (US$331.1 million) traded on the system.   The Toronto Stock Exchange said it will operate Coatsthrough a wholly owned subsidiary, to be called CanadianDealing Network, on a not-for-profit basis. The exchange saidit will ensure the system has adequate resources to operatethe quotation system and to create and enforce marketregulations.   Equity traders view the move as a positive step. They saidthe over-the-counter market will gain some much neededrespectability with the weight of the Toronto Stock Exchange,Canada's largest equity market, behind it.   &quot;It's a junior market and the big question for a lot ofthe players is compliance&quot; with securities regulations, saidJohn Ing, equity strategist at Maison Placements Canada Inc.in Toronto. &quot;It's a very risky market. It will become morecredible under the TSE,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
