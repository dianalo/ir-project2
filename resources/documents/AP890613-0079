The conference, attended by 60 countries, is expected to endorsea proposal to reduce the number of Vietnamese leaving their countryfor economic reasons and to promote regular emigration programs.   The plan will include screening procedures for all new arrivalsin Southeast Asian coastal states to determine whether they arefleeing political persecution. If they are, they will be eligiblefor refugee status and resettlement.   The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Lawrence S. Eagleburger,announced that over the next three years the United States willaccept 22,000 of the 55,000 Vietnamese now in refugee camps. Inaddition, the United States anticipates accepting up to half of allnew arrivals granted refugee status, he said.   Vietnamese officials called on the United States to accept morerefugees, but it was not immediately clear if Vietnamese officialswere satisfied with the U.S. commitment.   The number of boat people declined in the early 1980s, but theexodus has accelerated again. Almost 90,000 Vietnamese, three timesthe 1986 total, now are living in refugee camps assisted by the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees.   Another 100,000 refugees from Cambodia and Laos live in the camps.   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said today that 43 Vietnameserefugees, rescued by a United Arab Emirates tanker in the SouthChina Sea on June 4, arrived today at Tomakomai, a port on Japan'snorthernmost main island of Hokkaido.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said ``fairinternational mechanisms must be found'' to deal with boat people``while preserving the universal respect _ and preventing the abuseof _ the principle of asylum.''   Jean-Pierre Hocke, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, saidthe growing number of asylum seekers has caused an ``acute crisis''in Hong Kong and poses a burden for other coastal state destinationsof boat people.   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said one way to stopthe exodus would be to grant international assistance to regions ofhis country that face serious economic difficulties ``and whereillegal departures take place.''   He said Vietnam opposes the return of boat people who have beendenied refugee status, as urged by some countries.   Eagleburger also said the United States will remain oppposed toforcing Vietnamese refugees to return home ``unless and untildramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, social andpolitical life.''   Australia will take up to 11,000 Vietnamese now in camps and a``generous proportion'' of new arrivals, provided other countriesalso participate in the U.N. plan, said Foreign Minister GarethEvans.</TEXT></DOC>
