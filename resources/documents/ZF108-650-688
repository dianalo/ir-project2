(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If you use a modem, a whole section of your emergency kit should be devotedto tools and devices that enable You to connect to any phone, no matter howoblivious your hotel is to the needs of computer users.andP;  If your hotel hasthe type of Plug-in phone jack-called an RJ-11-found in most new homes, youshouldn't have any problem connecting.andP;  But some hotels, either because theirphone wiring is outdated or because they're afraid you'll steal the phone,have jacks that defy normal modem connections.andP;  So your emergency kit shouldinclude the following items.andM;A MODULAR DUPLEX JACK: With this Y-configured adapter, you can Plug two phonecords into one jack.andP;  If your modem doesn't have two jacks, you'll need thisto hook up Your laptop and your phone to the same line.andP;  That way you won'thave to unplug and replug the modem and phone each time you want to switchbetween the two.andM;A MODULAR LINE CORD: This has RJ-11 plugs at both ends.andP;  (Don't get the linecord that plugs between the phone and the handset; it looks similar, but theplugs are a different size.) The cord should be long enough (25 feet,usually) to let You set your laptop on a desk or table with good lighting andnot be forced to work by the bed.andM;AN IN-LINE COUPLER AND A SPARE TELEPHONE CORD: The coupler is a connectorwith female RJ-11 connections on both ends to connect two phone line cords.andO;This allows you to extend the line between the wall and your modem.andM;ALLIGATOR CLIPS: They are so named because they resemble an alligator's jaws.andO;You'll need them in those difficult situations where there's no phone jackavailable.andP;  The clips allow you to make a connection by hooking your modem tocontacts inside the phone.andP;  Also take along a 12-inch modular-to-spade linecord-an RJ-11 plug at one end and four wires with flat, U-shaped lugs on theother end.andM;KONEXX (sold under various labels, including Mo Fone): A device, availablefor $99, that allows you to hook up a laptop computer to virtually any typeof telephone through the handset.andM;A final note: Whatever else you bring, make sure your kit includes a small,flat-blade screwdriver to open phones and wall plates.andM;Hardware toolsandM;Portable computers are not as amenable to ad hoe repairs as are desktop PCs.andO;Laptop computers, in fact, are sometimes best left intact if you're not aprofessional repair-person.andP;  But you can often fix an ailing lunch-box orluggable portable with the tools listed below.andP;  Also bring the other tools wesuggest for handling less serious unforeseen emergencies.andM;SCREWDRIVERS AND NUT DRIVERS: A lunch-box or luggable computer can exhibiterratic behavior, such as rebooting for no apparent reason, makingcorn-grinding noises as though a drive is having a hard time getting up tospeed, or not recognizing that a drive, screen, or keyboard even exists.andP;  Thetrouble may be only a loose cable or an expansion board that's not seatedproperly in a slot.andP;  Bring along a screwdriver or nut driver-depending onwhether your case is held together by screws or hex-head nuts-to open yourportable so that you can press on each connection to make sure it's tight.andM;A SMALL FLASHLIGHT: If your travels take you to an area that is prone topower blackouts, or if you need to open up the back of your portable, it'snice to have a flashlight.andP;  The compact Maglite, sold at most camping supplystores, is good for traveling.andM;SURGE PROTECTORS: Equip your portable with two surge protectors, one for thepower line and one for the phone line.andP;  Power-line surges, which are commonin rural areas during thunderstorms, can zap your data or even your entirecomputer.andP;  Phone-line surges are just as dangerous; when lightning hits atelephone pole, it can send a jolt of electricity through the line and intoyour modem and PC.andP;  Radio Shack sells line protectors for both purposes.andO;Each is about the size of a child's building block.andM;A GROUNDED THREE-TO-TWO-PRONG ADAPTER: Most laptop AC power plugs and surgeprotectors require a three-prong outlet.andP;  But you may not be staying in aplace that has such an outlet.andP;  A three-to-two-prong adapter, available forabout $1 at any hardware store, will come in handy.andP;  Ground the adapter byattaching its lug to the screw holding the cover of the wall outlet plate inplace.andM;EXTRA BATTERIES: If your portable lets you swap batteries, your emergency kitshould include a spare set.andP;  Also consider packing the PC 100 Plus PocketPower Inverter from Statpower Technologies, which plugs into a car cigarettelighter socket to convert its electricity into AC power.andM;EQUIPMENT FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL: If your travels take you and your laptopabroad, you'll need a few special necessities: a set of foreign adapter powerplugs (available at most catalog showrooms and travel supply shops) and a220/240 volt converter, which will let your laptop work with the wall outletsused in many foreign countries.andP;  Don't use just any converter.andP;  Those soldwith the plugs are designed for hair dryers, irons, and the like and are notrecommended for sensitive electronic equipment such as computers.andP;  But manycomputer manufacturers offer converters as options, and some models, such asthe Toshiba 1000SE, come with a plug that will work with either 110 or220/240 current.andM;THE ROAD WARRIOR TOOLKIT: This product is a collection of tools Mad Max wouldfind handy when confronted by a hostile phone system.andP;  The shaving kit-sizedpackage from Computer Products Plus contains a screwdriver, a knife, variousphone wire connectors, a lighted magnifying glass, and even a strip ofVelcro.andP;  The Deluxe version includes CP Plus Connection, a version of Konexx.andM;Most importantly, the kit contains clear instructions on how to connect tophones in six different scenarios.andP;  The Road Warrior takes no hotelprisoners; at one point it tells you to use the screwdriver to remove wallplates that may conceal modular jacks.andP;  The kit's only drawback is that itdoesn't include a device mentioned in its instructions, the Blackjack-areplacement for a screw-on mouthpiece that has a connector for a modularphone line.andP;  The Blackjack is available from CP Plus for $49.95.andM;BLANK FLOPPIES: While this may seem obvious, good luck finding 3 1/2-inchdisks at your motel at 11 p.m.andP;  If yours should go bad and you have noextras, you're in trouble.andP;  If you're backing up files from a hard disk(always a good idea), you'll need lots of them.andM;MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS: It doesn't hurt to have a pair of needle-nose pliers,wire cutters, and a roll of electrical tape for problems that can be fixedonly by on-the-spot improvisations.andP;  You may never need these tools, but ifyou do, you won't find them at the newsstand in the hotel lobby.andM;Hardware isn't the only thing that can go bad on the road-you're just asvulnerable to software woes.andP;  If you pack what we've listed below, you'llfind that you can handle most software emergencies you encounter.andM;DOS FUNDAMENTALS: You can't use your computer if you can't boot it.andP;  If justone file on your hard disk or boot diskette goes bad, you might be cut offfrom all the files that are in perfect working order.andP;  So create an extraboot diskette that contains all the system files you need to start up yourcomputer from a floppy drive.andP;  In fact, to be safe, you should have two suchdisks.andP;  If you keep one in your computer's carrying case, store the other inyour luggage.andM;Your boot floppy should contain more than the system files needed to get to araw DOS prompt.andP;  It should also include the device drivers that let youcontrol your extra memory, system clock, screen display, and other features,as well as complete and current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.andM;If the boot area of your hard drive goes bad, first boot from the floppy andswitch to the C: drive, then access your data.andP;  Whatever you do, if you runinto hard-drive trouble, don't reformat while traveling.andP;  Wait until youreturn home to calmer surroundings before taking that drastic step.andM;Remember that you should not simply copy AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS fromyour hard drive to a floppy.andP;  Edit them so that the lines they contain makesense working from a diskette.andP;  For example, on a hard drive you may preferto store device drivers in a subdirectory, and your CONFIG.SYS file wouldcontain lines such as these:andM;DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYSandM;DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM.SYSandM;But if you're copying your device drivers to the root directory of the floppydisk you take on the road, the lines should be edited to indicate the newlocation of the drivers:andM;DEVICE=ANSI.SYSandM;DEVICE=QEMM.SYSandM;On 286 and 386 portables, a CMOS chip retains your system setup parameters.andO;Include a copy of your laptop's diagnostics disk in your kit so that you canquickly reset those parameters if your CMOS battery dies.andP;  Although some PCshave the setup routine in ROM, you should note the parameters, especially thedrive type, on a slip of paper, which you should tuck into the sleeve of yourdiagnostics disk.andM;DOUBLE DATA: Next to the files that boot your computer, your most importantfiles are those containing your current work, so bring extra copies of themwith you.andP;  Also, you should remember to carry copies of your applicationprograms on diskette.andP;  Don't pack the spare disks in your laptop case; itmight get lost or stolen.andM;While you're making copies, don't forget to duplicate those utilities anddesktop tools you routinely use, such as SideKick.andP;  If you travel frequentlywith your computer, create a batch file that you'll run before each trip andthat will copy your important data files to diskettes.andP;  See &quot;TRIP.BAT: TheUltimate Batch File for the Frequent Traveler,&quot; on page 116, for such a batchfile.andM;FILE RECOVERY: Include in your emergency kit a package such as PC Tools orThe Norton Utilities.andP;  With either product, you can recover lost files andeven a scrambled hard drive.andP;  Remember, though, that for these products torecover a hard drive most efficiently, you must use their programs thatcreate special files with information about your File Allocation Table FAT)and put those files into an unused area of the drive.andP;  The programs restorefiles if you accidentally format the drive or if the FAT is damaged.andM;Along with your diagnostics disk, The Norton Utilities or PC Tools providesvaluable information about what's working and what's not working in yourcomputer-which helps you fix problems by yourself when a repair technicianisn't around.andM;Technical SupportandM;Chances are that your computer's manufacturer provides telephone support,perhaps even through a toll-free number.andP;  That can be useful, provided youhave the number with you.andP;  Don't keep numbers on a floppy or a hard disk-inan emergency you may not be able to retrieve them.andP;  Here are a few numbers ofmanufacturers:andM;Dell Computer Corp.:andM;(800) 624-9896.andM;NEC Technologies:andM;(800) 366-3632.andM;Toshiba America:andM;(800) 999-4273.andM;Sharp Electronics:andM;(800) 732-8221.andM;Texas Instruments:andM;(512) 250-7407.andM;Zenith Data Systems:andM;(800) 877-7704.andM;Compaq Computer Corp.:andM;(713) 370-0412.andM;Under its Exceptional Care warranty program, Toshiba will replace your brokenmachine with a working one overnight.andP;  The service is free for the firstyear; the cost of extending the program two more years varies with the model.andO;Extending the program for a Model 1000, for example, costs $199, while atwo-year extension for the Model 5200 is $1,399.andP;  If you're enrolled in theprogram, have your agreement number and your machine's serial number with youin case you have to call.andM;TRIP.BAT: The Ultimate Batch File for the Frequent TravelerandM;Before hitting the road with your computer, run a batch file to make sure youdon't forget to copy any important files to diskettes.andP;  Here's an example ofhow such a batch file, TRIP.BAT, might look.andP;  it assumes that you take Lotus1-2-3 and SideKick with you when you travel, that you've customized eachprogram for your laptop, and that you've put each on its own diskette.andP;  Touse it, create a subdirectory on your desktop machine called \TRIP forkeeping the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and systems files you've created towork with your laptop, and \ 123 \TRIP123 for the Lotus worksheets you'llbring with you.andP;  Finally, use an .NTS extension in SideKick to identify yournotes files.andP;  TRIP.BAT will help you create three disks: Trip 1, for 1-2-3;Trip 2, which contains SideKick's phone directory and notes from its notepad;and Trip 3, a boot diskette with proper configuration files for your laptop.andM;ECHO OFFandM;CLSandM;ECHO Place Trip 1 disk in Drive A:andM;ECHO (Trip 1 should contain 1-2-3 customized for your laptop)andM;PAUSEandM;MD A:\123DATAandM;COPY C:\123\TRIP123\*.WK* A:\123DATAandM;C:andM;CLSandM;ECHO Place Trip 2 disk in Drive A:andM;ECHO (Trip 2 should contain SideKick customized for your laptop)andM;PAUSEandM;COPY C:\TOOLS\SIDEKICK\PHONE.DIR A:andM;COPY C:\TOOLS\SIDEKICK\*.NTS A:andM;CLSandM;ECHO Place Trip 3 disk in Drive A:andM;ECHO (Trip 3 disk should be a bootable disk)andM;PAUSEandM;COPY C:\TRIP\AUTOEXEC.BAT A:andM;COPY C:\TRIP\CONFIG.SYS A:andM;COPY C:\TRIP\*.SYS A:andM;CLS</TEXT></DOC>
