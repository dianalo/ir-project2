Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> FIN </IN><TEXT>   Michelle Englander thought she had found the perfect way to spend more time with her two toddlers while still keeping her hand in her law practice.    She became a legal temp. Instead of working the 60-hour to 70-hour weeks required by many law firms, she signed on with Special Counsel Inc., a temporary-lawyer agency in New York. Until giving birth in March to her second child, she worked part time and plans to do so again soon.    &quot;This is the perfect way to keep up my credentials,&quot; says Mrs. Englander, 30 years old.    About a dozen agencies like Special Counsel have sprung up recently around the country. Hundreds of lawyers now make their living as legal itinerants, moving from firm to firm, following the work. And many law firms and companies, attracted by the cost savings and flexibility they offer, have started using legal temps.    But the growing reliance on lawyer temps is a trend in trouble. Critics, including the American Bar Association, have raised ethical questions about allowing temporary lawyers to work for many firms in a short period -- perhaps learning the secrets of myriad clients along the way and creating potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the New York City bar ruled recently that legal temp agencies can't receive a portion of their temps' hourly fees, endangering the practice there.    This bar opposition comes at a time when legal temping is just hitting its stride. For many small and medium-sized law firms, hiring temps like Mrs. Englander offers a solution to a problem that has plagued their practices: how to increase staffing for a big case without being stuck with too many lawyers once the work crunch is over.    Fred Profeta, a partner in a two-man New York law firm, says that using temporary lawyers &quot;gives us the freedom to be able to take on more work.&quot;    For businesses needing short-term legal services, temps are an alternative to outside law firms, which charge as much as $200 an hour per lawyer -- several times more than the cost of a temp.    &quot;Outside law firms have become prohibitively expensive for routine matters,&quot; says Charles Bonnes, general counsel of London-based BOC Group's U.S. operations in Montvale, N.J. BOC, a health-care and industrial-gas company, is now using three temporary lawyers. Their work, Mr. Bonnes says, is &quot;excellent.&quot;    For the lawyers themselves, temping offers the high pay and variety of private practice along with the flexibility of part-time or sporadic full-time work. About 25% of the lawyers who find work through legal temp agencies are, like Mrs. Englander, young mothers who want to keep practicing so that they can easily return to the full-time work force in a few years. Others are older lawyers who aren't quite ready to retire. And still others are like Jim Lemonedes, a 33-year-old aspiring actor who works as a part-time lawyer to support himself because &quot;it's better than waiting tables.&quot;    The economics are simple but controversial: The temp agency charges a client an hourly fee for the lawyer's work -- generally $40 to $80 an hour. The agency keeps 25% to 35% of the fee.    Last month, however, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York ruled that this system violates a disciplinary rule banning the sharing of fees between lawyers and non-lawyers -- a rule meant to prevent ambulance chasers from steering clients to lawyers in return for part of the fee.    The ruling has met heavy opposition. The association has received so many complaints that it is scheduled to reconsider its ruling at a meeting today. If the ruling stands, though, &quot;we will be put out of business,&quot; says Lesley Friedman, the owner of Special Counsel.    The New York bar says it has been contacted by members of other bar associations, but it isn't clear whether other jurisdictions will follow New York's lead.    In its ruling, the New York bar said a temp agency might encourage its lawyers to bill more hours than necessary, thus padding its pockets at the expense of the law firm and its client. Or, the group said, the agency might encourage its lawyers to finish a particular project quickly, without necessarily doing their best work, so that they could be reassigned to a more lucrative account.    But agency owners deny that they have any say about how many hours their lawyers work. &quot;We are just a matchmaker for attorneys who want to do free-lance work,&quot; says Robert Webster, co-owner of San Francisco-based Lawsmiths, which has offices in California and New York. Special Counsel's Ms. Friedman adds: &quot;No business person would force lawyers to work more or fewer hours because it would alienate both attorneys and clients.&quot;    Even if the temp business survives the New York challenge, a larger threat looms on the horizon. The American Bar Association has been reviewing several ethical matters raised by the temp industry and is expected to issue an opinion this year. ABA ethics opinions provide guideposts for rulings by state disciplinary committees.    The ABA fears that temps move so broadly through the legal community that they are likely to land at firms opposing clients represented by a temp's prior firm. The result, if the temp divulges client confidences learned at the previous firm, could be serious breaches of ethical standards.    The ABA is expected to decide later this year whether special guidelines are required to govern temps or whether they should be treated the same as full-time lawyers who switch firms, according to Peter Moser, a Baltimore lawyer who chairs the ABA's ethics committee.    Currently, full-time lawyers who switch firms must disqualify themselves from working against a former client on any matter substantially related to one they handled before. And they are strictly barred from revealing client confidences.    Opponents of stricter rules for temps argue that because associate ranks at the nation's major law firms have swelled in recent years, associates now switch firms quite often in pursuit of opportunities for advancement, and no spate of ethical problems has resulted. In all cases, the opponents argue, lawyers are capable of policing themselves.    &quot;Conflict and confidentiality problems confront every good-sized law firm today,&quot; says Geoffrey Hazard Jr., a professor at Yale Law School. Mr. Hazard, a specialist on legal ethics who has been retained by Special Counsel's Ms. Friedman, adds that there is a greater danger that associates who move will have more secrets to disclose than temporary lawyers. &quot;Temporary lawyers are brought in to handle specific jobs and are closely supervised,&quot; Mr. Hazard says, while associates work longer hours and handle a wider range of tasks.    All the controversy has temps worried. Mr. Lemonedes, the aspiring actor, says he has given up part-time work for the moment. &quot;Although I don't agree with the ruling, I don't want my ethics questioned, nor do I want any appearance of impropriety,&quot; he says.    The New York City bar opinion &quot;is discriminatory against women with children, like me,&quot; says Mrs. Englander. She fears that if the group stands by its ruling, &quot;I won't be able to work anymore.&quot;    ---                       Lawyers for Hire   Following are some of the biggest agencies that provide temporary lawyers                                                  No. Of     Agency              Headquarters             Lawyers     Contract     Attorneys           San Francisco            300     The     Lawsmiths           San Francisco            200-300     Special     Counsel             New York                 200     LAW/temps           Chicago                  175-200     TempLaw             Stanford, Conn           175     Law     Professionals       Atlanta                  75-100     Lawyer's     Lawyers             Washington, D.C.         50     Tactical     Services            New York                 30     Lawstaf             Atlanta                  Fewer                                                  than 10     Source: American Lawyer magazine</TEXT></DOC>
