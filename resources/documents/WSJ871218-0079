The industry group said its research shows a $817 million increase in CDs in November, up from $531 million in October when the stock market crashed. CD inflow was $279 million in September. In November of last year, the 85-member savings banks had a net CD outflow of $508 million.    Including all types of accounts, total deposits showed a net increase of $381 million in November, compared with an outflow of $344 million in November last year.    The jump in CD deposits &quot;confirmed earlier predictions that consumers would seek safe havens for their funds in the wake of stock-market turbulence,&quot; said Robert O. Lehrman, president of the association. Outstanding CD assets at the end of November totaled $48.30 billion, accounting for more than half of all the savings banks' deposits. </TEXT></DOC>
