The action follows a statement last Wednesday that the government was considering assuming more takeover regulatory power, which would infringe on the panel's self-policing role in the financial industry. The self-regulatory system has been widely criticized, especially by opposition lawmakers, in the wake of the government's investigation of Guinness's takeover last year of Distillers Co.    Under the new rules, the takeover panel said it would require disclosure of ownership when a buyer reaches 1%, down from 5% at present, of the shares of a bidding company or its target. The ownership level at which disclosure of every trade becomes mandatory also was reduced, to 5% from 10%. In addition, the panel imposed rules that try to make it harder for interested parties in takeovers to trade in shares anonymously, or to offer secret inducements to buy or sell shares.    The beefed-up rules are aimed at many of the possible abuses and illegalities that have surfaced in the investigation of Guinness, one of Britain's largest liquor and brewing companies. The government's queries have turned up acknowledgments from Guinness and others of massive and orchestrated Guinness share buying, some of it through secret accounts or with financial assistance offered by Guinness officials. The buying boosted Guinness's share price and, consequently, the value of its mainly stock offer for Distillers.    In its first word on Guinness since the investigation began last Dec. 1, the panel said &quot;it seems likely&quot; that there were violations of its takeover code during the Guinness-Distillers bid. But until the government investigation is finished, the panel said it wouldn't conduct a separate investigation or issue any censures.    The panel's rules don't have any legal force but generally have been accepted by the parties in a bid. Because it lacks investigative powers, however, the panel often lacks evidence to stop abuses. The panel is financed and staffed mainly by the financial industry.    The requirement for ownership disclosure at 1% will mean that more parties will be identified earlier, when they take an interest in takeover stocks. In Guinness-Distillers and other major British takeover bids, large investors often go over 1% holdings as part of legitimate efforts to help the companies involved.    One of the new rules will mandate that any &quot;inducement&quot; to buy or sell shares will have to be disclosed by the party doing the trading. Previously, the panel had only expressly required the disclosure of protection against market risk, such as the indemnities that Guinness has said some of its directors offered buyers of its shares. Under the new rule, other forms of inducements also would be covered, such as direct cash payments or promises of future business for the ally.    Another new rule would require that the involved companies or their allies identify the name of the beneficial owner of any &quot;nominee&quot; account in which share transactions are going on. Such accounts are used by a securities firm on behalf of a customer in a third name, allowing trading by allies to remain anonymous, as it did in the Guinness affair.    This requirement, however, may be difficult to enforce. Brokerage houses aren't often informed themselves of the beneficial owners, especially when they are handling trades on behalf of foreign securities firms.    Separately, speculation grew that the British police would get involved in the Guinness investigation to pursue a possible case of general fraud, which isn't covered by the corporate laws under which the government is acting. Asked about British newspaper reports that the police were about to move on Guinness, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said there was no current investigation, but &quot;check back tomorrow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
