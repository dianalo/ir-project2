HumbertoRegalado Hernandez told The Associated Press by telephone.``Apparently it is a crude and vulgar press campaign against thearmed forces.''   He called a meeting of the armed forces general staff ``toanalyze the serious accusations presented by The New York Times,which damage me personally and also all our armed institution.''   The Times, citing high-ranking Honduran officers who want to seethe general replaced, reported Sunday that Regalado had solddonated U.S. military equipment to the Honduran military anddeposited the proceeds in a special account he controlled.   The newspaper said many of the officers, who spoke on conditionof anonymity, were among Regalado's most loyal supporters untilthey discovered the arms deals.   The Times said Honduras has asked the U.S. Defense Department toinvestigate corruption complaints against Regalado because of apossible congressional cutoff of military aid to the country.   ``It's a wild tale against me,'' Regalado said. ``I don'tcontrol one cent of those funds. I live from my salary, and I amnot rich.''   His official salary is believed to be about $5,000 a month.   Regalado, 50, has been chief of the armed forces since January1987.   The United States began increasing military aid to Hondurasafter the leftist Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua. Militaryaid for 1989 was $41.1 million, and $61.3 million is planned for1990.</TEXT></DOC>
