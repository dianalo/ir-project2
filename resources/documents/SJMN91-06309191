But when it comes toapplying high tech to their own businesses, Silicon Valley firms are fallingshort.;   The internal processes and procedures at many of these localcompanies are so antiquated that they appear to have been cloned directly fromthe Eisenhower era. Local executives hate to admit it, but most of them wouldrather invest in product development than improve the process. Maybe it seemspedestrian to worry about mundane systems and support infrastructure, such assales order entry and accounts payable, when you're striving to introduceleading-edge technology.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HIGH-TECH FIRMS NEED BASIC BUSINESS SENSE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Viewpoints; Walt Wilson of Saratoga is vice president in the San Franciscooffice of CSC Index, a management consulting firm.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But profit margins are eroding, and many former high-tech products havebecome commodities. High tech has become a cost-control game, and controllingcosts means re-engineering how business is conducted to benefit frominformation technology.;   Take a standard process like order entry. Toooften, a Silicon Valley company has its salesperson visit a customer, get anorder and fax or phone the information to an order department. There, a personwith clerical training is expected to take specs on dozens of complex productvariables. Orders are frequently left incomplete or held indefinitely. Salesreps may batch orders for entry, or the order department will batch a numberof entries, which delays the entire cycle. It's not uncommon to see 50 percentof a month's orders entered in the last few days of the month. This prolongsthe sales cycle, delays valuable information from reaching manufacturing andcreates a lot of errors.;   To make matters worse, the process so far hassimply entered data and in many cases does not create a factory order.;   Isit any mystery that the customer is dissatisfied with what gets delivered andis left fuming while the manufacturer's technical staff struggles to bring theinstallation up to spec? The CEO of a big local manufacturer recently said,&quot;Our factory is not meeting its schedule, and we're not producing quality.&quot;But the real problem was a high rate of order entry problems, many of whichhad to be corrected in midstream during the building schedule. The factorydidn't have a prayer of keeping on schedule nor could manufacturing know thatit wasn't building to customer specification until the equipment arrivedon-site. The CEO didn't think about order entry; he only saw the slippage ofquality and a bungled manufacturing schedule.;   When I described thissituation to a senior vice president of a local Fortune 100 maker of largesystems, he shook his head. &quot;That sounds like the way we take orders,&quot; hesaid. &quot;We put all our effort into marketing and selling the product, and thenwe screw up when the customer finally decides to buy something.&quot;;   Thingsdon't have to be this way. Plenty of U.S. companies in high-, low- andmiddle-tech industries are re-engineering their processes, transforming theirorganizations and leveraging their technologies for competitive advantage.While many continue to seek quality in manufacturing, they have discoveredthat painstaking attention to business processes improves quality.;   Forexample, Bose Corp., a manufacturer of loudspeakers in Framingham, Mass., hasasked seven vendors to eliminate salespeople and buyers. Instead, the vendorshave placed representatives in Bose's purchasing department (at the vendors'expense) to create orders, manage inventory and provide parts &quot;just in time.&quot;The in-plant vendor program has cut Bose's processing and ordering costs whileproviding greater stability and efficiency for its vendors.;   Similarly,Xerox Corp. has stopped sending one of its customers, Bechtel Corp., paperinvoices for each order because Bechtel said it prefers being billedelectronically once a month. In another example of process re-engineering, adivision of General Electric Co. is experimenting with letting major customersenter orders directly into GE's data system. S.J. Johnson Wax of Racine, Wis.,has slashed by 40 percent the time needed to fulfill orders through abroad-based information system that links people in sales, customer service,manufacturing, distribution, credit and finance, shipping and warehouseoperations. Johnson Wax employees now spend more time serving customers andless time squabbling over internal barriers.;   In another effort, NabiscoFoods now receives 88 percent of orders electronically, the highest rate inits industry. The company provided independent food brokers with a computerprogram that allows them to communicate electronically with a logistics database in Nabisco's central order processing facility, eliminating the need forfaxes, phone calls and internal hand-offs. Nabisco has streamlined its orderprocessing staff from 34 to seven, while reducing errors and acceleratingdelivery time.;   There was a time when superb new products alone could propelSilicon Valley companies to higher growth. But technology life cycles aredramatically smaller. High-tech manufacturers need to expand their investmentpriorities beyond product development and realize that the re-engineering ofkey business processes now plays a crucial role in a company's success.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Walter P.
