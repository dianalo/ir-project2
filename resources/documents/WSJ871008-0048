The Elyria, Ohio-based health-care equipment maker earned $944,000, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $28.9 million in the year-ago third quarter.    Invacare told security analysts that although it couldn't estimate net income for the quarter, it believed pre-tax margins throughout 1987 would exceed those of 1986. The company also expects overall sales growth for the year of between 12% and 15% from the year-earlier $111.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
