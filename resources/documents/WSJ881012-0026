Dealers said the approaching U.S. trade report for August, scheduled for release Thursday, prompted many of them to dump long dollar positions retained over the holiday weekend. A national holiday in Japan and the Columbus Day partial holiday in the U.S. kept most participants in those nations out of the market Monday.    While economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect the August trade gap to come in near $11.3 billion, following the $9.53 billion shortfall in July, some traders and bank analysts said they are looking for the August trade gap to exceed $12 billion.    &quot;People feel that the rate of U.S. export growth is on the decline, and that customs figures indicate imports may be higher than expected,&quot; said one analyst at a British bank in New York. &quot;Naturally, that spells trouble for the trade figures.&quot;    Nervous dealers sent the dollar as low as 130.70 yen and 1.8480 marks Tuesday, but the currency enjoyed solid commercial support at those levels and staged a healthy recovery in late afternoon New York trading.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8548 marks, slightly higher than 1.8545 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 131.08 yen, down from 133.30 yen in New York late Friday.    The late quote yesterday against the yen was the lowest in New York since June 22, when the U.S. currency was quoted at 130.84 yen in late New York trading.    In Tokyo on Wednesday, the U.S. dollar opened at 131.12 yen, down from Tuesday's close of 131.15.    The British pound, which continues to benefit from recent comments by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, was quoted late yesterday at $1.7156, up from $1.6989 in New York late Friday. Mr. Lawson has stated that U.K. interest rates will be held at levels attractive enough to keep inflation in check and the pound strong. Dealers are eagerly awaiting Mr. Lawson's speech Thursday at the annual convention of the Conservative Party to see if the U.K. finance chief will elaborate further on his country's monetary and exchange rate policies.    The Bank of England, however, intervened lightly yesterday morning to stem the pound's rise, market sources said. Officials at the Bank of England declined to comment on the intervention, but one trader in London said the bank sold small amounts of sterling for dollars in what appeared to be a &quot;smoothing operation.&quot;    The bulk of the dollar's descent against the yen took place during Tokyo dealings, when traders drove the U.S. unit below critical chart support at 131.50 yen. The dollar slid quickly to near 131 yen as Japanese institutional players dumped long positions in exchange for yen and sterling.    Dealers in New York said comments from Japanese finance officials may have contributed to the yen's gains. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed little concern about the yen's recent sharp rise against the dollar, saying the overall exchange rate remains stable, Kyodo News Service reported.    Separately, Kyodo reported that Bank of Japan officials said that market sentiment toward a higher dollar rate against the yen has apparently weakened somewhat, indicating a turning point in the higher dollar trend that has prevailed since the Toronto Economic Summit in June.    Keiichi Udagawa, the manager of foreign exchange at Bank of Tokyo Trust in New York, said, &quot;The dollar moved up from about 125 yen in June to 136 yen by late August, and now it's clear that the momentum has turned the other way. On the one hand, this (retreat) is a clear technical turnaround. But on the other hand, it also reflects a change of sentiment toward the dollar.&quot;    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $404.90 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
