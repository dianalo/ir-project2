The group, Action for Corporate Responsiblity, is also extending its boycott to American Home Products Corp., which makes Wyeth infant formula.    Action, based in Minneapolis, contended that both companies are violating the World Health Organization code and, in effect, dumping large quantities of formula in the Third World by giving it away to hospitals. Both companies denied the allegation and said that, in keeping with the code, they provide supplies only at the written request of hospitals or health facilities.    Carol-Linnea Salmon, Action's associate director, also asserted that giving out free supplies in hospitals isn't an &quot;act of charity&quot; because women aren't informed about the costs of purchasing infant formula. The group also objects to encouraging new mothers in poor countries to forgo breastfeeding because local water supplies may not be sanitary and mothers may not understand formula usage instructions.    &quot;For Action to say we are in violation of the world health code is simply not true,&quot; said Thad Jackson, special issues director for Nestle, which controls 40% to 50% of the world-wide infant formula market.    Mr. Jackson emphasized that, under the code, Nestle is allowed to provide &quot;free and low-cost infant formula supplies.&quot; He added: &quot;If a hospital comes to us and asks for supplies, under the code we have almost a obligation to provide them.&quot;    American Home Products said its Wyeth-Ayerst division was also in &quot;full accord&quot; with the World Health Organization code. The New York pharmaceutical company added that the WHO has never challenged Wyeth's marketing practices.    Action contends that the previous Nestle boycott cost the company, which is based in Vevey, Switzerland, $5 billion in lost sales, disrupted growth and costs associated with fighting the boycott. But Mr. Jackson said the financial impact was minimal. He noted that, during that period of the seven-year boycott, the $21 billion company's U.S. sales grew to 30% of total company sales, up from 19%. </TEXT></DOC>
