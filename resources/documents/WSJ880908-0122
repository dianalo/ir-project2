Bertil D. Nordin, chairman of the computer equipment maker, cited the recent sharp decline in the price of its stock as an &quot;opportunity to use some of (Digital Communications') cash reserves to reduce the number of shares outstanding.&quot;    Digital Communications shares closed at $21.625, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. At that market price, the buy-back would represent about 1.2 million shares, or 11% of the company's 10.5 million common shares currently outstanding.    The stock lost about 30% of its value last week, following an announcement by the company that it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue to fall 15% to 20%, compared with results for its fourth quarter ended June 30. </TEXT></DOC>
