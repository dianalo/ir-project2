 Such vows, however, are beneficial in that they are theproduct of reflection on what needs improving.andM;In this spirit, I offer a list of IRM resolutions for President Bush and hisappointees.andP;  Although the administration is new and can be deemed not guiltyof past transgressions, most of the top people were around during the Reaganyears and could benefit from an attempt to do things better.andP;  Besides,serious problems do exist with IRM.andM;So, let the Bush administration solemnly resolve to:andM;* Appoint well-qualified administrators as senior IRM officials and avoidregarding the top agency administrative job as a &quot;no-brainer&quot; that anypolitical hack can handle.andM;* Avoid confrontations with the House Government Operations Committee, asepitomized by the battle over FTS 2000.andP;  The departure of the combative Rep.andO;Jack Brooks (D-Texas) should make this easier.andM;* Try to get Reagan's &quot;junkyard dogs&quot; -- the agency inspectors general --back on a leash.andP;  One way to do this might be through a critical review ofclaimed savings that appear in the IG annual reports.andM;* Avoid appointing another 45-member task force like the Grace Commissionthat will spend years studying everything under the sun.andP;  Instead, useexisting channels and mechanisms to solve problems.andM;* Take a critical look at the government's incentive awards system,especially the big cash bonuses given to the Senior Executive Service, whichoften go to those who exhibit the most servility toward agency politicalappointees.andM;* Develop an A-76 contracting-out policy that makes sense for both sides.andO;This requires a critical look at &quot;cross-servicing&quot; arrangements like thosethat permit the Agriculture Department's National Finance Center to become aservice bureau for other agencies.andM;* Encourage agencies to seek more competition among 8(a) companies forset-aside contract awards to ensure that several qualified 8(a) offerers geta shot at the business.andP;  Many agencies do this already, but maybe it shouldbe government policy.andM;* Determine whether massive computer requirements contracts, such as thewinner-take-all awards the Air Force makes to a single contractor, reallyfoster competition or get the best deal for the user.andM;* Look at GSA's Schedule 70 to see if it is worth all the effort to negotiateand administer.andP;  Open-market purchases get as good or better prices withoutthe hassle.andM;* In a similar vein, find out whether GSA's Office of Technical Assistance isadding value to the schedule contracts it administers or merely is addingoverhead as a &quot;pass through&quot; organization.andM;* Avoid pressuring agencies to participate in FTS 2000 if it is not in theirbest interests.andM;* Abolish OMB's Presidential Priority Systems on grounds that suchdesignation represents unnecessary central agency oversight.andP;  Aren't scrutinyof the budget and the five-year IRM plan sufficient?andM;* Protest agency technology training programs from any budgetary crunch.andP;  Theold aphorism that travel and training are the first to suffer should bedisproven in the interests of keeping IRM technology skills current.andM;* Stop telling federal computer people they're not keeping up with theprivate sector.andP;  As every knowledgeable person knows, the feds may be laggingin some areas but in others they're out in front.andM;* Ask the Justice Department to determine whether de facto standard-settingby computer industry consortiums is undermining consensus-seeking nationalstandardization efforts like those of the American National StandardsInstitute and Federal Information Processing Standards.andM;* Stop pushing the agencies to buy outside software packages, especially whenthe cost of adapting this off-the-shelf software may exceed the cost oftailored system development.andM;* Declare a truce in the war between grand design systems and incrementalsystem development.andP;  Urge the agencies to design applications based on needsanalysis.andM;* Avoid sponsoring projects, conferences, studies and publications that focuson what government will look like in 2000 and use the funding to solveproblems in 1989.andM;I could go on at greater length but, as we all know, the more resolutions wemake, the more there are to be broken.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
