(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The builder of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker'sHeritage USA is asking supporters of the failed PTL ministry formillions of dollars to buy the Christian retreat, and he says theBakkers don't fit into his plans.   Roe Messner, president of Commercial Builders of Kansas and abuilder of churches nationwide, told about 25 people in OrlandoSaturday he wants to offer $50 million to $55 million to a U.S.Bankruptcy Court for the property.   Messner told the Orlando group, gathered in a motel room about amile from the Shoppers World mall where the Bakkers set up a churchsix months ago, that he needs a $2 million commitment from PTLsupporters by Nov. 25.   He stressed that while he is a friend of the Bakkers, he has notdiscussed his plans with them.   ``This has nothing to do with Jim and Tammy whatsoever,'' hesaid.   Messner said he is concentrating on the PTL's ``lifetimepartners,'' people who gave money, usually $1,000, in exchange forpromises of annual lodging for life at Heritage USA.   Tammy Bakker preached to about 75 people at couple's storefrontchurch on Sunday. She blamed hate-filled ``surface Christians'' forthe downfall of the Bakkers' multimillion-dollar ministry.   Mrs. Bakker cried as she told of her husband's weekend phonecall from a federal prison in Rochester, Minn., where he is servinga 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy.   ``He said, `Honey, it's so bleak here,''' she recalled. ``Iasked the Lord today to put some sunlight in Minnesota.''</TEXT></DOC>
