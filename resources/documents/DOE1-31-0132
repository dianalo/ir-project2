Two levels of catalytic cracking severity were used inthe evaluation. Performance and product analysis showed that hydrotreatingimproves the yields obtained from catalytic cracking and the qualityof the resultant products. In contrast to results obtained with the Wilmingtonfeedstocks, conversion and gasoline yield do not improve with severityof the hydrotreating of the Mayan vacuum gas oils. The insensitivityof the cracking performance to hydrotreating severity may reflect themore facile removal of polar compounds (heteroatom compounds) on hydrotreatingof the Mayan gas oil in comparison to the Wilmington. Sulfur and nitrogencontents of the liquid products (gasoline, light cycle oil, heavy cycleoil) decreased as the severity of the feed hydrotreating increased. 7refs., 12 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
