<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-1213 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some short circuits in a generation and transmission network are of thephase to phase type; in this case, the circuit affected is normally trippeddefinitely, and hence, it is lost for the operator (at least up to themoment when an operator ask for a reclosure). This paper considers thepossibility of adopting the fast single phase opening and reclosing procedurealso in the case of phase to phase (with no ground) faults, to allow,in case of transient faults, to keep the circuit in operation.</TEXT></DOC>
