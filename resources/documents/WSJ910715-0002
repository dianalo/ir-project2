The Fed, which has referred the matter to the U.S. JusticeDepartment for possible criminal prosecution, said it hasdeferred assessing any civil penalties against BCCI, whichwas seized by regulators in several countries on July 5, andthe individuals involved pending completing of the JusticeDepartment inquiry. The Fed plans to hold a hearing inSeptember before determining any enforcement action.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, government and congressional investigators arestarting to focus on BCCI's links to the Central IntelligenceAgency and also to the Iran-Contra affair. It has been clearfor months that the CIA maintained accounts at the bank,which were used to finance covert activity.   In 1984, using Mr. Pharaon as a front man, BCCI's officersillegally acquired Independence Bank for about $23 million,according to the Fed. &quot;Secret arrangements&quot; were made bysenior officials of BCCI to have Mr. Pharaon acquireIndependence Bank on behalf of BCCI, the Fed alleged, and &quot;toconceal the transaction from the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., the Federal Reserve and state regulators in violationof the Bank Holding Company Act and other laws.&quot;   The three former BCCI officers concerned are Agha HasanAbedi, the bank's founder and chairman; his protege SwalehNaqvi, chief executive; and Kemal Shoaib, a senior officerwho became chairman of Independence.   The Fed charged that BCCI, acting through one of itsCayman Islands units, International Credit andamp; Investment Co.(Overseas), agreed under contract with Mr. Pharaon that hewould hold 85% of the stock of Independence as a fiduciaryfor ICIC. In addition, the Fed charged that Mr. Pharaon madefalse statements in regard to his dealings representinghimself as the true buyer of Independence.   Mr. Pharaon, who has homes in the U.S., France, SaudiArabia and Pakistan, has recently declined to returntelephone messages. His New York attorney Richard Lawler saidin a telephone interview Thursday that Mr. Pharaon has donenothing wrong, but he declined to comment further. Mr. Lawlerdidn't return a telephone call made after the Fed releaseddetails of its planned enforcement action late Friday.   The other three men couldn't be reached for comment. Mr.Abedi, who retired from the bank after suffering hearttrouble in 1988, is in Pakistan; Mr. Naqvi is in Abu Dhabi,and Mr. Shoaib is in London, according to former colleagues.A lawyer at Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow, the Washington law firmthat has recently represented BCCI, declined on Friday tocomment to questions concerning BCCI, instead referring callsto the bank's receiver in the Cayman Islands. The receiver,however, said he couldn't comment until he had reviewed allthe relevant paperwork.   Independence Bank's chief executive Fulvio Dobrich saidyesterday that since his arrival at the bank more than a yearago, neither he nor the directors &quot;have received anydirectives from either Mr. Pharaon or BCCI.&quot; He added thatmedia coverage linking the bank through Mr. Pharaon to BCCI&quot;has done very considerable damage to Independence.&quot; He saidthe attention has caused &quot;loss of customers, inability toattract prospective customers, loss of funding and tradingfacilities, and loss of employees.&quot; He also said that it hasscared away potential investors from the bank.   BCCI, a $20 billion private bank that was seized byregulators in Britain, the U.S. and five other nations onJuly 5, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years.The Bank of England, which orchestrated the internationalseizure of BCCI, cited &quot;widespread fraud going back manyyears,&quot; as the reason for closing the bank's Britishoperations.   BCCI, which also covertly held a stake in the parent ofFirst American Bankshares Inc., Washington's largestbankholding company, has come under increasing scrutiny inrecent years for a growing number of alleged illegal acts,including money-laundering, violating various banking andforeign-exchange regulations, and involvement with arms anddrug smugglers.   Meanwhile, investigators are focusing on BCCI's links withintelligence agencies and the Iran-Contra affair. A Senateinvestigation of BCCI led by Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) willhold hearings later this month to look into the bank's tiesto intelligence agencies, as well as the bank's considerablerelationships with the central banks of many developingnations, especially in Africa and Latin America.   In recent years, it has been alleged that the CIA andother intelligence agencies used BCCI to make secret paymentsand that the bank had a role in helping to hide covertshipments of weapons to Iran.   Some circumstances have attracted the interest ofinvestigators. For example, Rahim Irvani, an Iranianassociate of BCCI who fled his country after the 1979 Iranianrevolution, apparently set up a consultancy with former CIADirector Richard Helms in Washington in 1980, Senateinvestigators contend. Mr. Irvani couldn't be reached forcomment yesterday.   Separately, Senate investigators are intrigued that TampaDistrict Attorney Robert Genzman, who negotiated BCCI'sguilty plea to money-laundering charges in January 1990, hadpreviously served as associate minority counsel on the HouseSelect Committee to investigate covert arms transactions withIran. Mr. Genzman couldn't be reached for comment over theweekend.</TEXT></DOC>
