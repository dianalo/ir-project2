In California, the Democrats nominated their mostcompetitive candidate for governor, Dianne Feinstein, andwrecked a heavily financed Republican campaign to change therules on redistricting congressional seats in the nation'sbiggest state.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, California voters showed that the day of&quot;no new taxes&quot; for any purpose is over. They demonstrated howtaxes can be increased at a time when the public is deeplydivided on the question of general tax increases by votingnarrowly to double their own state gasoline tax to 18 cents agallon from nine cents. The money is targeted for highwayrepairs and mass transit.   &quot;There is still no willingness on the part of most peopleto pay for what we need,&quot; says Alan Post, veteran legislativeanalyst. The exception, he adds, is transportation, where aslim majority of California voters now &quot;are beginning torealize something has to be done.&quot; The ballot initiative, No.111, was passed by a margin of 52% to 48%.   In Iowa, Democrats nominated an abortion-rights candidatefor governor who will force a showdown with an incumbent GOPgovernor opposed to abortion. And in North Carolina,Democrats chose former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, who isblack, to oppose Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in a dramaticmatchup in the fall.   &quot;We had one foot on a banana peel and one foot in thegrave,&quot; says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman, &quot;andsomehow we ended up Wednesday morning standing up and inperfect political health.&quot;   California, where so many political movements begin (andsometimes end), launched the nation's tax rebellion 12 yearsago by voting for Proposition 13, putting brakes onproperty-tax increases. On Tuesday, voters approved aproposal that was backed by the Republican governor,Democratic lawmakers and almost every professionalassociation in the state, and opposed by a small group ofconservatives who were unable to mount a significant mediacampaign to make their case.   &quot;There was something in this for just about every interestgroup in the state,&quot; says Austin Ranney, a politicalscientist at the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;Therewasn't any big group against it and it still only won by alittle.&quot;   The initiative was broadly supported in the large urbancenters, where traffic congestion is so bad that Californiansfear their quality of life -- the reason that many moved tothe state in the first place -- is at risk. TV ads weretargeted to those markets, showing in detail which roadswould be improved and where new mass-transit lines would bebuilt. Voters in rural parts of the state voted against theproposal.   Although anti-tax economist Arthur Laffer says the vote&quot;really does end the tax revolt in California and sends amessage to Washington which I dislike intensely,&quot; anotherCalifornian, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,says the vote shows that new taxes win popular support onlyif they are directed to specific purposes. &quot;Deficitreduction,&quot; the Democratic congressman said, &quot;might notqualify as such a tangible specific purpose.&quot;   For Washington politicians grappling with their own budgetproblems, California provided evidence that tax increasesalso need bipartisan backing and broad grassroots support.The California vote, says Senate Budget Committee ChairmanJames Sasser (D., Tenn.), indicates voters will approve taxincreases when they are &quot;absolutely necessary.&quot;   The California vote to sharply raise the state's gasolinetax hardly leads the way for a big federal gas-tax increase,for example. Bush Administration officials have argued overthe last several weeks that increases in state gasoline taxescould make it tougher to raise federal gas levies.   The other significant political development in Californiawas the selection of Mrs. Feinstein, the former mayor of SanFrancisco, as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Mrs.Feinstein defeated state Attorney General John Van de Kamp,52% to 41%, and will oppose Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilsonin the fall.   Aides to the colorless Mr. Wilson admit that the stylishMrs. Feinstein is a more formidable rival than Mr. Van deKamp. Republicans count on a huge campaign war chest todefeat Mrs. Feinstein, who exhausted most of her cash in theprimary.   Mrs. Feinstein surged into the lead with her opening TVcommercial, in which she underlined her support of the deathpenalty. She ended the campaign with another blockbustercriticizing Mr. Van de Kamp for his refusal, when he wasdistrict attorney in Los Angeles, to prosecute the killerknown as the Hillside Strangler for murder. Mr. Van de Kampprivately opposes both abortion and the death penalty, butsaid he would enforce existing laws in both instances.   Republicans had counted on California voters to approveone or another of two ballot initiatives that would haveremoved redistricting powers from the Democratic-controlledstate legislature, which in the past has been amazingly adeptat drawing boundary lines virtually guaranteeing Democratichegemony. But, despite a lavishly financed media campaignfeaturing actor Charlton Heston, both propositions fell. IfMrs. Feinstein is elected governor, replacing retiringRepublican Gov. George Deukmejian, the GOP's situation willbe desperate. California is expected to pick up as many asseven new congressional seats in the wake of the 1990 census.   Mr. Heston, appearing in TV ads, urged California votersnot to allow Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to&quot;con&quot; them again in painting the GOP-backed initiatives asbad for California. Television ads opposing the initiativesstarred actor Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in ads opposingan earlier GOP effort to change the redistricting rules.   In another ballot proposal, California voters approved asweeping ethics package that bans legislators and stateofficials from taking fees for making speeches or writingarticles and from earning outside income by representingclients before government boards or agencies. It also createsa citizens' salary commission to review and adjust thesalaries and benefits of legislators and state officialsannually without a vote being required by the legislature.   Voters in the city of Los Angeles passed a similar ethicspackage for their officials and also provided publicfinancing for campaigns for mayor and city council.   Californians also supported a ballot initiative that wouldstop sport hunting of mountain lions and set a floor of $30million a year that the state must spend on wildlife-habitatprotection.   Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson's victory in thegubernatorial primary transforms the general election into aheated contest over abortion. Mr. Avenson, who handilydefeated Attorney General Tom Miller and businessman JohnChrystal, will face popular two-term GOP Gov. Terry Branstadin November. The abortion fires set during the primary aresure to be stoked in the state during the general election bya parallel Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, whofavors abortion rights, faces a challenge from GOP Rep. TomTauke, who opposes them.   The Avenson win, moreover, was a victory for the NationalAbortion Rights Action League, which faced substantial localopposition for its decision to get involved in a heavilycontested primary and to endorse one abortion-rightscandidate, Mr. Avenson, over another, John Chrystal.   &quot;This may have been a risky strategy, but it wasnecessary,&quot; says Kate Michelman, executive director of thegroup. &quot;We couldn't say that one guy was anti-choice and notsuggest which person would be the best to win the nomination.Our goal was to insure that the voters in Iowa have a choicein November, and we accomplished that.&quot;   Meanwhile, the victory of former Charlotte Mayor Gantt inthe North Carolina senatorial runoff sets up a high-profileNovember battle between the black Democrat and GOP Sen.Helms. Mr. Gantt took 57% of the vote in a bruising primaryagainst District Attorney Mike Easley.   Experts in North Carolina politics believe Mr. Gantt willneed about 40% of the white vote plus almost all of the blackvote to defeat Mr. Helms, whose financial advantage andability to appeal to blue-collar whites make him thefavorite. &quot;This will be a classic confrontation,&quot; says EarlBlack, a specialist on southern politics at the University ofSouth Carolina. &quot;This will be a great test of ideological andracial differences in a major state.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
