Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,said on ``CBS This Morning.''   ``There are a lot of people that were executives of thriftsaround the country that are personally liable and we ought to begetting after them,'' said Dixon, who heads the Banking subcommitteeon consumer and regulatory affairs.   ``We ought to invoke safety and soundness rules against statesthat are liberalizing investment laws for thrifts and endangeringthe security of those institutions,'' he continued.   ``And we ought to be putting some money into the FSLIC (FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. fund and reducing the number ofthrifts in the country, getting rid of the bad ones and supportingthe good ones.''   Asked if there was any chance Congress would approve a proposalfloated by the Bush administration to charge depositors at banks andSandamp;Ls a fee of 30 cents per $100 deposited to help pay for insurance,Dixon said ``none whatsoever.''   ``I haven't heard of anybody that likes the idea and I think thatidea is born dead,'' he said.   White House chief of staff John Sununu said Sunday that theproposal remains a live option despite widespread congressional andindustry opposition. He also said on ABC's ``This Week with DavidBrinkley'' that ``there are a variety of options being examined.''   Noting that financial institutions have long paid a fee forfederal deposit insurance, Sununu said the plan under study wassimply a matter of ``taking the current fee and adjusting it toaffect the reality.''   If financial institutions were to pass along such an increasedfee directly to depositors, American savers still would be getting abargain for having their savings insured by their government, hesaid.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, said on the same program ``that trial balloon of puttinga tax on deposits was really very foolish.''  </TEXT></DOC>
