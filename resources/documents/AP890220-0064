The official organ of the Communist Party has seen itscirculation fall 20 percent a year recently. Currently, 4 millionpapers are printed a day, the most of any daily in China, but only 2percent of subscribers are private citizens.   In a front page letter to its readers, the paper said the changewould increase the amount and the timeliness of news.   ``We also will work to reflect the opinion of the people and helpemploy public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses,closer to life,'' it said.   In the past, the paper has been filled with reports aboutbureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there. Tidbits ofimportant information were often buried.   Breaking news such as plane crashes and important governmentdecisions was either not reported or published late and with scantdetails. The paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues oflittle import to everyday life.   Many Chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift inthe political wind. But as the society has become more concernedwith economic development than ideology, the paper's usefulness _and its readership _ has diminished.   Monday's editions differed from previous weeks, but only slightly.   International news was displayed on page one. Several breakingstories were reported with current details. An unusual reportappeared on the status of China's military draft. More photographslined the pages.   ``They wouldn't have had this a while ago,'' said Kang Kexing,pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawlingfor eels on the Yangtze River. ``Before, they'd only report it afterit ended.''   A companion story asked the Agriculture Ministry for reaction.``Telephone Interview By The Paper,'' read the headline.   ``They seem to be showing off here,'' said Kang. ``Very pleasedwith themselves for reporting this so soon.''   Other readers pointed to a story on Salman Rushdie's apology toMoslems angered by his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''   ``In the past, it seemed that the only international news we gotwere things almost directly related to China,'' said one reader.``This has nothing to do with China. That seems to be a change, anda good one.''   The changes are limited, however. The People's Daily, like allChina's papers and publications, remains run by a government veryconcerned with what is read by its people.   Newspaper officials interviewed Monday said they believed thechange would help the circulation which has dropped further sinceJanuary when the paper doubled in price to about 5{ cents.   Readers on the street were less enthusiastic.   ``There's no comparison between this and some of the otherpapers,'' said Yang Gong, a 23-year-old university student.   Indeed, the People's Daily is by far the stodgiest of the fourdailies with the highest circulation in China.   The No. 2 paper, the Worker's Daily, although generallyconservative, occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power forthe state-run labor union. Next in line, the Legal Daily, often isfilled with lurid stories of murders and rapes.   The No. 4 paper, China Youth News, is one of the most interestingpublications in China. Over the last seven months, it has written onlabor strife, prostitution, homosexuality and the uses of liquor forbribery.   ``The People's Daily was boring before and it's boring now,''said Chen Daqin, a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glasscase holding Monday's editions on bustling Wangfujing Street.``They've changed the soup but the prescription's the same.''</TEXT></DOC>
