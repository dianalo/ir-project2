Senior officials said Mr. Shultz made the unexpected request to counteract flagging morale among the Contras and their supporters. U.S. support for a Central American peace plan signed by five Central American presidents a month ago has raised fears among conservatives that the administration may be abandoning the Contras.    &quot;We need to end the doubt and uncertainty about the capacity and commitment of the United States that is created by the recurring cycle of off-again, on-again aid decisions punctuated by protracted and divisive debate,&quot; Mr. Shultz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said the money, far more than the $140 million congressmen expected the administration to request, would be paid over 18 months.    The Shultz announcement angered House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), who said the administration shouldn't be talking about more military aid at a time when the prospects for peace are encouraging. &quot;Such a request would anticipate the failure of the peace process,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't anticipate the failure of the peace process. I anticipate success.&quot;    Earlier this summer, President Reagan and Mr. Wright offered a bipartisan peace plan. It was overtaken a few days later by the Central American presidents' own proposal, which Mr. Shultz endorsed as &quot;a good beginning.&quot; In agreeing to the Reagan-Wright plan, the administration has promised it wouldn't seek additional military funds until after Sept. 30 in order to give the search for a peaceful settlement time to work.    Yesterday, Mr. Shultz only said the president would request the additional Contra aid &quot;at the appropriate time.&quot; However, congressional staff members said administration officials meeting with Mr. Wright yesterday indicated that they would wait some time after Sept. 30, when the current allotments run out.    They said the request more likely would come nearer Nov. 7, the date the Central American presidents' peace plan is supposed to take effect. The presidents will evaluate the results of the plan on Jan. 7. An administration official said President Reagan would risk losing an early congressional vote against the aid if he requested it any earlier than November.    &quot;It was essential to make this announcement now so that the Sandinistas would know there is funding around the corner if they don't live up to the terms of the agreement,&quot; said an administration official. &quot;We have been deliberately vague about the timing, however, and we won't act against our own interests.&quot;    Administration officials denied charges that the $270 million figure, which would be for both military and nonmilitary aid, was a &quot;highball&quot; amount to be negotiated. Instead, they said, the figure reflects the Contras own increasing activities. &quot;They have an expanded area of operations, expanded numbers of forces and expanded actions,&quot; said an administration official.    The Shultz announcement spurred charges by Nicaraguan leaders that the U.S. is thumbing its nose at regional leaders. &quot;This attitude shows contempt for the leaders of the region, who in the Guatemala accord called upon the United States to stop waging war against Nicaragua,&quot; said Carlos Tunnerman, Managua's ambassador to Washington. &quot;The administration couldn't have come up with a worse idea at a worse time. . . . Everyone knows peace cannot be achieved by fanning the flame of war.&quot;    Mr. Shultz, however, argued that the Contras' heightened military effectiveness has played a large role in bringing the Sandinistas into the Central American peace plan. The plan, agreed to by Nicaragua and the other four countries of the region -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- would require a ceasefire throughout the region and an end to all outside military aid to insurgents. </TEXT></DOC>
