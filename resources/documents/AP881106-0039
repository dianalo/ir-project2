(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Human howls fill the night in the woodsof New England, where hunters and naturalists are on the prowl forthe coyote, which is rapidly replacing man and dog as the chiefpredator of deer.   In recent years, the rarely seen coyote has grown in such numbersthat Massachusetts has started a hunting season and Maine huntersare worried there soon may be more coyotes than deer. Sheep farmersin Maine say the animal is driving some out of business.   But conservationists say reports of coyote kills are exaggeratedand that the animal is doing some good.   ``When you look at the vast majority of coyotes in the state,they are providing a degree of balance and diversity in the wildlifecommunity and in the ecosystem,'' said Paul Lyons, a wildlifebiologist for Massachusetts' Metropolitan District Commission. ``Themore diverse the community, the better it is for everybody.''   Lyons is one of the naturalists who howl at night in the hugeQuabbin Reservoir in western Massachusetts. The naturalists hope theanimal will howl back. From the howls, they say they can learn wherethe animals hunt and live.   One thing the naturalists have learned is the coyotes have drivendomestic dogs from the reservoir. The dogs had been a predator ofthe deer.   Massachusetts has an estimated 1,000 coyotes; Maine has at least16,000, officials said.   The coyote is among the most intelligent of wild animals, saythose who track it. Related to the wolf, the eastern coyote is thesize of a small German shepherd with a fox-like head, bushy tail andgray-black coat. It averages four feet long from nose to tail tipand weighs about 40 pounds.   The western coyote migrated east in the 1930s, breeding with theAlgonquin wolf along the way and evolving into a larger species.   Since 1980, Massachusetts officials have confirmed 28 coyoteattacks on lambs and other small livestock. All but three of the 75deer carcasses found last winter at the Quabbin reservoir werekilled by coyotes, naturalists said.   Massachusetts started coyote hunting in 1981 after a handful offarmers claimed coyotes had killed newborn calves. Since then,hunters have killed 20 to 40 coyotes yearly in Massachusetts,officials said.   The Massachusetts Audubon Society opposed coyote hunting, sayingthere was insufficient evidence the animals seriously threatenedecological stability. A coyote protection bill failed in theLegislature in 1981, and the farmers prevailed.   Richard Turner, southwestern wildlife district game manager forMassachusetts, said coyotes may even be a help, since they eatanimals killed by cars or other causes and keep such pests asrabbits and field mice under control.   Maine hunters and sheep farmers, however, call them a menace.Unofficial estimates of the number of Maine deer killed by coyotesrange from 3,000 to 15,000 yearly. Officials have no estimates onsheep killed.   Maine has never banned coyote hunting, and officials said atleast 1,600 coyotes are killed by hunters and farmers annually.   One pro-hunting group, the Maine Coyote Control Association, hasoffered a $25 reward for each dead coyote during hunting season,which runs most of the winter.   ``I'd poison them if I could,'' said Connie Skov, a Maine sheepfarmer who said has lost nearly a dozen sheep to coyotes. ``They arejust no good.''   She said coyote attacks have helped drive eight small sheep farmsout of business in Waldoboro, 80 miles north of Portland.   But Henry Hilton, animal damage control adminstrator for Maine,said there are ways to stop the sheep kills.   ``A lot of farmers will attest to the fact that if you use aminimum amount of sound husbandry, it's just not a problem,'' hesaid.   Hilton said coyotes don't have much of an impact on the deerherd. Since 1986, he said, the herd has been increasing because ofbans on hunting doe and other regulations.   Coyote hunting continues simply because the animal is far from anendangered species, he said. ``If there is no reason to protect themfrom harvest, that leaves them open to be harvested,'' Hilton said.</TEXT></DOC>
