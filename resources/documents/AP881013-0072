The rebels Wednesday captured several hills at Methawaw on thewestern bank of the Moei River that separates Burma and Thailand,said the official who asked not to be named. Fighting for thestrategic hills began Sept. 26.   The Karens, the strongest armed opponents of the Rangoongovernment, lost the area in April 1984 to the Burmese army.   The Karen official also said rebel camps on the Thai border werepreparing for government attacks.   Burmese leader Gen. Saw Maung ``regards us as his enemy so hisorders may involve more attacks on our camps,'' he said, referringto Thay Baw Bo and Kle Day camps that house more than 4,000students and other Burmese.   Students were at the forefront of recent, pro-democracydemonstrations in Burma, but were driven underground by Saw Maung'stroops, who by official count have killed about 450 people since aSept. 18 military coup.   Several thousand have fled to the Thai-Burmese border seekingrefuge and military training from ethnic minorities, including theKarens, who are also fighting the central governemnt.   The official said he had no details on casualty figures andreported no fighting today between the rebels and the army.   ``We didn't encircle them this time because that involves heavylosses of lives on both sides,'' he said. ``For retreat, we leftthem a way out.''</TEXT></DOC>
