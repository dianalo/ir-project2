We issued an affirmative preliminary determinatinon September 14, 1984 (49 FR 37134, September 21, 1984). We preliminarilydetermined that there was a reasonable basis to believe or suspect thatcertain benefits which constitute boundaries or grants within the meaningof the Act were being provided to Industria Nacional de Cemento, S.A. (INCSA),the only cement manufacturer to export cement from Costa Rica to the UnitedStates during the review period, calendar year 1983, and that the net boundaryor grant was 15 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> On October 29, 1984, we initiated a proposed suspensionagreement pursuant to section 704 of the Act. In accordance with section704(g) of the Act, the Department will continue the investigation if arequest is received within 20 days after the date of publication of ournotice of suspension agreement. We did not receive such a request; thereforewe issued no final determination.On July 11, 1989, the suspension agreement was cancelled and we resumedour investigation of portland hydraulic cement from Costa Rica. [See, ``PortlandHydraulic Cement from Costa Rica; Final Results of Countervailing DutyAdministrative Review, Determination To Cancel Suspension Agreement, andResumption of Investigation'' (54 FR 29078, July 11, 1989).] On July 24,1989, we informed all interested parties of our resumption of the investigation.As discussed in the ``Review Period'' section below, we determined thatour review period in this resumed investigation would be calendar year1988, and therefore on July 27, 1989, we sent a questionnaire to the Governmentof Costa Rica in Washington, DC. On August 11, 1989, we received certificationsof non-exportation of the subject merchandise from the Government of CostaRica, INCSA, and Cementos del Pacifico, S.A. From August 24 through August25, 1989, we conducted verification of the government and companies certificationsof non-exportation in San Jose, Costa Rica. On September 20, 1989, we receiveda case brief filed on behalf of the petitioner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Thewritten description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is portland hydraulic cement,other than white non-staining portland cement, from Costa Rica. This merchandiseis currently classifiable under HTS item number 2523.29.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review Period </ITAG>At the time of the resumption of this investigation, the information onthe record covered the review period, calendar year 1983. We determinedthat this information did not reflect current importing trends of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, for the purposes of this final determination, calendaryear 1988 was determined to be the most accurate review period by whichto measure whether benefits which constitute bounties or grants withinthe meaning of section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act),are being provided to the manufacturers, producers, or exporters in CostaRica of the subject merchandise. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comment </ITAG>Petitioners contend that the Department should issue a final affirmativedetermination and that a countervailing duty of 15 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> should be assessed against any imports of portlandhydraulic cement from Costa Rica to the United States. Petitioners arguethat substantial amounts of cement from Costa Rica were being importedinto the United States at the time of the filing of the petition and atthe time the investigation was originally initiated in 1984. Petitionersfurther argue that portland hydraulic cement from Costa Rica was beingimported into the United States at the time of the suspension agreementand at the time of the Department's review of the agreement. In addition,the Government of Costa Rica has admitted that, and the Department hasfound that, countervailable subsidies have been and are available to exportersof portland hydraulic cement from Costa Rica to the United States duringthe most recent review period. The decision of the Costa Rican cement producersto stop exporting to the United States should be disregarded by the Departmentand should not constitute a basis for reaching a negative final determination.DOC Position As discussed in ``Portland Hydraulic Cement From Costa Rica; Final Resultsof Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, Determination to Cancel SuspensionAgreement, and Resumption of Investigation'' (54 FR 29078, July 11, 1989),we resumed our investigation on the date of publication of this noticeof final results of the review. We determined that in order to measurewhether the manufacturers, producers, or exporters of portland hydrauliccement from Costa Rica are being provided benefits which constitute bountiesor grants within the meaning of section 303 of the Act, the review periodshould reflect the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year. The Department's official import statistics do not list any exports ofthe subject merchandise from Costa Rica to the United States from 1987through the present. Based on verification of the certifications of non-exportationsubmitted for the purposes of this investigation, we have determined thatthe manufacturers, producers, or exporters of portland hydraulic cementfrom Costa Rica did not export to the United States during the review period,calendar year 1988. Therefore, we determine that subsidized imports ofportland cement did not enter the United States during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determination in accordancewith section 776(b) of the Act. During verification we followed standardverification procedures including meeting with government and company officials,examining relevant documents and accounting records, tracing informationin the responses to source documents, accounting ledgers and financialstatements, and collecting additional information that we deemed necessaryfor making our final determination. Our verification results are outlinedin detail in the public versions of the verification reports, which areon file in the Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building.This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act [19U.S.C. 1671d(d)]. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
