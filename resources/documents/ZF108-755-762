 That's understandable.andM;A few too many charlatans resulted in the entire used car industry beingpainted with the same unsavry brush in the minds of many customers.andP;  Today,the label of &quot;used car salesman&quot; is almost as condemning as &quot;snake oilsalesman&quot; was 50 years ago.andM;But the fact remains that there are a lot of similarities between purveyorsof &quot;previously enjoyed&quot; automobiles and computer equipment.andP;  In truth, thesimilarities probably far out-number the differences.andP;  One unfortunatesimilarity is that, while most used equipment brokers are honest,knowledgeable professionals, there are some whose business practices soclosely resemble those of their car-dealing brethren that they may as well bemaking awful TV commercials too.andM;Knowledgeable usersandM;A major difference is that, generally, used equipment brokers deal withcustomers who are far more knowledgeable than the average Joe Shmoe who walksonto a used car lot.andP;  Which may be one reason why few slick operators in thisbusiness survive very long.andM;Still, we regularly hear tales of woe from MIS professionals and otherexperienced users venturing into the used market for the first time.andM;Some of these experiences are due to unprofessional or unscrupulous brokers.andO;But, to be fair, many arise because of unrealistic expectations of what theused equipment dealer can provide.andM;For instance, supply and demand is a real force to contend with in thisworld, as much as or more than it is in the new equipment market.andM;Currently, certain upgrades to the larger IBM System/36s are in tight supplyand are rising in price.andP;  Some examples are &quot;D&quot; upgrades, trailers and 358 MBdrives.andM;A System/34 or System/38 is a different story and has been since the AS/400came on the market; there are plenty of them around because no one wants themanymore.andP;  The System/36, however, is the Chevrolet of the marketplace, withsufficient power at a reasonable enough price to still make it a good bet formany companies wanting to upgrade.andM;So, just as with new equipment, you should have a few alternatives in mind,especially if time is of the essence in getting that new disk drive,controller or printer into your shop.andM;Alternatives are thereandM;In our experience, many prospective customers come to us because they areworried enough about buying used equipment.andP;  So at minimum, they want thesecurity of buying a used &quot;big name&quot; like IBM.andP;  Yet, in many cases, therewill be similar but lesser-known products more readily available that will dothe job they need done, at the right price.andM;A knowledgeable broker should at least be able to suggest alternatives toexplore, whether they are in his warehouse or not.andP;  But recognize thatknowledgeable means knowing the equipment he specializes in and its directcompetitors, not the entire business technology universe.andM;For instance, just as you wouldn't expect a dealer of a used Mercedes torecommend a good alternative to a Lada, we wouldn't attempt to advise you onpurchasing your next PC.andM;High demand for many used systems and peripherals is also the reason toregard with skepticism any broker offering to get certain equipment for you&quot;in a week or so.&quot;andP;  Better yet, insist on putting an enormous late deliverypenalty in the purchase contract and watch how quickly he'll try to wriggleout of that offer.andM;A penalty optionandM;In fact, a late delivery penalty should be in the contract for any sizablepurchase to encourage the supplier not to &quot;play poker with your chips.&quot;andM;He's betting he can find what you need by the delivery date, whether or nothe's actually started sourcing possible supplies.andP;  But you're the one who maybe hiring staff and making commitments that depend on the prompt delivery ofthat equipment.andM;Such is tha volatility of the used market that even an honest,well-intentioned broker can return to the prospective seller within hours andfind a deal has been signed with another buyer.andP;  Or he can encounter delaysby the refurbisher, the shipping company, customs and so on.andP;  A late deliverypenalty will ensure that he's doing everything possible at his end to getthat product to you.andM;Final payment should also depend upon your ability to ensure servicing of theequipment.andP;  With IBM, that's relatively easy because of the documentsprovided to the seller that follow the equipment to the purchaser forcontinuation of maintenance.andP;  The best protection is to stipulate that theinvoice will not be paid until the equipment has been accepted for service.andM;Your contract should also stipulate that all replacement parts or adds-onsare manufacturer-approved.andP;  IBM has been known to refuse to service hardwarewith &quot;counterfeit parts,&quot; and there are few users who can tell them apartjust by &quot;looking under the hood.&quot;andM;The used computer market can be an excellent source for lower price, fasterdelivery or a wider range of financing options.andP;  In many cases, you canrealize all of these advantages.andP;  But be careful: promises easily made arejust as easily broken.andP;  If you aren't sure of the quality of the product thatwill be delivered, be absolutely sure of the quality and integrity of theorganization you are buying from.andM;It's a little akin to that story of the pioneer astronaut sitting atopseveral hundred tons of vibrating rocketry awaiting lift-off.andP;  The controltower inquired if he was nervous.andP;  The astronaut replied: &quot;i sure as hell am.andO;I just realized I'm sitting on top of two million parts, and it was all puttogether by the lowest bidder.&quot;andM;In the used equipment market, as in all else, you get what you pay for.andM;Jack Murphy and Lome Ireland are respectively, president and vice-president,Murcomp Data Services Inc., a supplier of used equipment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
