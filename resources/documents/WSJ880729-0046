Inc. filed for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, becoming the first major firm taken private in a junk-bond-financed leveraged buy-out to do so.    The filing comes after the collapse of a plan to rescue the drugstore chain by exchanging equity in Revco for the $703 million of junk bonds.    Revco's action didn't alarm holders of public debt in other highly leveraged concerns, bond analysts said. But one high-risk securities specialist said the Revco case could set precedents in establishing legal liabilities of participants and advisers involved in unsuccessful LBOs as well as liabilities of junk-bond brokers.    The Twinsburg, Ohio-based operator of 2,000 drugstores, once the nation's premier chain, hoped to avoid a Chapter 11 filing with an &quot;all equity&quot; recapitalization plan, said Boake A. Sells, Revco's chairman and chief executive officer. The plan was proposed by Drexel Burnham, Lambert Inc., which had been recently hired to design a rescue plan.    The original $1.25 billion leveraged buyout, in December 1986, was put together by Salomon Brothers Inc. When the company filed yesterday in federal bankruptcy court in Akron, Ohio, it listed assets of $1.2 billion and liabilities of $1.5 billion.    In a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Discussions with major bondholders broke down even before the Drexel plan was formally proposed. Mr. Sells said Transcontinental Services Group N.V., listed on the London Stock Exchange and owner of 60% of Revco's common shares, resisted the recapitalization plan.    But Nathan V. Meyohas, chairman and chief executive officer of Transcontinental, asserted that the investment firm agreed to go along with the plan proposed by Drexel. In fact, Mr. Meyohas said Transcontinental this week wrote off its entire $9.6 million investment in Revco.    None of Revco's major bondholders would comment for attribution on what caused discussions to break down.    However, one person involved in the talks said Revco was unwilling to hire lawyers, accountants and other professionals proposed by a bondholder group that was attempting to play a role in Revco's recapitalization. Also, Revco wouldn't guarantee that all equity and bondholders would go along with the proposed recapitalization. In addition, Transcontinental insisted that it would probably lose its control over the company through issuance of additional stock, the person said.    The bondholder group, composed of Magten Asset Management Corp., of New York, and Fidelity Investments and Keystone Custodian Funds Inc., both of Boston, ultimately disbanded.    Afterward, however, Magten, which holds $100 million of Revco's 13 1/8% bonds, pressed for accelerated payment on those securities. That move ultimately triggered the Chapter 11 filing. The person involved in the negotiations said Magten believed Revco couldn't come up with sufficient cash to &quot;make everyone happy.&quot;    As previously reported, Revco failed in June to make a $46 million semiannual interest payment on $703.5 million of publicly held bonds, including the bonds held by Magten.    Among the liabilities are $125 million of 11 3/4% debentures and bank loans totaling about $320 million. Near the bottom of the pile are $50 million of 12 1/8% notes, $140 million to $150 million of claims by trade creditors and the $703 million of junk bonds. All three would rank as general unsecured creditors, a company spokeswoman said.    Major bank creditors are Wells Fargo andamp; Co and Marine Midland Bank. Among the largest trade creditors are Bindley Western Drug Co., Merck Sharp andamp; Dohme, a unit of Merck andamp; Co, Eastman Kodak Co., Whitehall Laboratories Division, a unit of American Home Products Corp., Upjohn Co., Gillette Co. and Harris Wholesale Co., the spokeswoman said.    Mr. Sells said the company hopes to file a reorganization plan within four months. He said the company currently is negotiating new financing and hopes to have credit facilities in place next week.    Shipments of products to Revco stores probably would be disrupted during the next few weeks, but Mr. Sells added that the company currently has an ample supply of inventory valued at more than $500 million.    Revco doesn't have any plans to sell off drugstores, lay off employees or to abandon print or television advertising as a result of the filing, the executive said.    In recent weeks, Revco's most actively traded 13 1/8% bonds were selling in the 50 cents on the dollar range.    Chriss Street, manager of the Reorganized Securities Group at Bateman Eichler Hill Richards Inc., said he expects Revco to be in reorganization for about three years because of protracted litigation over the LBO failure. On that basis, he estimates that Revco's 13 1/8% bonds are worth 41 cents on the dollar while others are worth as little as 16 cents on the dollar. </TEXT></DOC>
