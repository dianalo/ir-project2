Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act The Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.2. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actionsdirectly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis and regulatory review by OMB.

This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.3.
