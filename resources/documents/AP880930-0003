Its renaissance and its expanding role in the internationalarena were crowned on Thursday with the award of the Nobel PeacePrize for 40 years of peacekeeping.   For nearly eight years, Washington rebuked the U.N., accusing itof anti-Western bias and bureaucracy and punished it with acrippling withholding of U.S. dues.   But for the past six months, the United Nations has been on aroll, toting up success after success in conflict resolution, withmore to come. The award to the 10,000 soldiers in the U.N.peacekeeping forces is the latest praise lavished on the world body.   U.N. achievements include an Iran-Iraq cease-fire; an agreementon Afghanistan; peace plans for southern Africa, Western Sahara andCambodia, and arranging talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.   And this week, the Reagan administration made up with the UnitedNations, praising its work, paying some long overdue debts andpromising to pay up everything owed eventually.   The belated, limited U.S. donation will help, but not solve U.N.funding problems or finance the shopping list of new peacekeepingforces, observers, election monitors and other peacemakers beingenvisioned.   President Reagan conceded Monday in his seventh and finaladdress to the General Assembly that ``Yes, the United Nations is abetter place than it was eight years ago, but so, too, is the world...   ``We see not only progress but also the potential for anincreasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutionslike the United Nations.''   While giving high marks to patient U.N. diplomacy, mostobservers attribute its achievements to improved East-Westrelations and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire toextricate his country from regional conflicts involving Soviettroops and proxies.   The latest U.N. victory came Aug. 20 after Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar arranged a cease-fire between Iran and Iraqand deployed 1,500 peacekeepers, observers and support personnel.   The U.N. chief is conducting further talks with Iran and Iraq,trying to consolidate the cease-fire and reach a lasting peace.Those talks appear likely to continue for a year or more.   The U.N. success story began April 13 with the signing of theAfghanistan agreement, providing for withdrawal of more than100,000 Soviet troops. It was negotiated over seven years of U.N.mediation, about 50 unarmed U.N. observers were deployed to monitorthe pullout and investigate violations.   In southern Africa, a 10-year-old U.N. independence plan forSouth-West Africa, or Namibia, is to be put into effect in Novemberas part of a peace agreement among South Africa, Angola and Cuba.At least 7,000 U.N. peacekeepers are likely to be required there.   In the Western Sahara, representatives of Morocco and thePolisario independence movement accepted a U.N. peace plan callingfor elections in the region.   In Southeast Asia, the secretary-general has proposed a peaceplan and talks are under way among the Cambodian and Vietnamesefactions.   Most diplomatic observers expect that a U.N. peacekeeping forcewill be needed in Cambodia to monitor an eventual Vietnamese troopwithdrawal and to supervise elections.   On the Cyprus problem, the secretary-general broughtrepresentatives of Greek and Turkish communities together for thefirst time in three years in Geneva last month and further talksabout the divided island are plannned.   ``The recent achievements of the United Nations have neitherbeen sudden nor fortuitious,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday in astatement to the General Assembly about the Nobel Prize.   ``They are the hard-won results of persistence and dedicationover many years, epitomized by the peacekeeping activities of theorganization.''   In his annual work report this month he said: ``Considering thevast sweep and scope of the possibilities now opening forconstructive multilateral action through the United Nations, thefinancial health of the organization needs to be immediatelyrestored.''   He said the United Nations is still seriously short of cash andreserves and without reserves it cannot mount new peacekeepingoperations.   The present peacekeeping cost is $230 million a year and newoperations are expected to raise the total annual bill to $1.5billion to $2 billion.   Member states owe a total of about $484 million in peacekeepingarrears, including about $70 million owed by the United States.   The arrears in the regular budget total about $593 million, withthe United States _ the largest contributor and debtor _ owingabout $452 million of that. Washington promised to pay $188 millionby the end of November and pay back the rest of its back dues overseveral years.   About 100 of the 159 U.N. member states also are in arrears.   ``It would be paradoxical and discordant,'' Perez de Cuellarsaid, ``if the organization should face financial difficultiesprecisely when it has to meet the demands of a more constructivephase of international affairs.''</TEXT></DOC>
