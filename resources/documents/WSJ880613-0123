The King of Sweden spoke, and more than 7,000 conferees were channeled through metal detectors, their bags and briefcases opened and searched. The security measures, unprecedented at a scientific conference, followed political demonstrations at the previous session in Washington, D.C.    The conference -- an annual scientific summit on the viral epidemic that affects 200,000 people in 136 countries, according to the World Health Organization -- isn't expected to yield breakthroughs.    Participants expect progress reports on vaccine animal models and on early human tests, though experts continue to insist that a practical vaccine may not be available for five to 10 years. New drugs, still in the test tube or in preliminary safety tests, will be discussed, though a cure still seems elusive. Education efforts, while they have succeeded in sharply curbing infection in the homosexual community, have yet to have a similar impact on minority and drug-using communities.    In therapeutics, Philip Pizzo has disclosed the first results of his study of the drug AZT (azidothymidine) in children. Of a group of 21 children who received the drug intravenously, 13 started out with neurological abnormalities, including delayed development and difficulty walking. All 11 of the children that Dr. Pizzo was able to evaluate improved in their developmental milestones, ability to walk and other neurological areas. Several of the children increased their IQ scores, and &quot;gross abnormalities&quot; that had appeared on brain scans were reduced. The children also showed less swelling in their lymph glands, better weight gain and increases in T-4 cells, the white blood cells central to the immune system.    While Dr. Pizzo said that the study was encouraging, he also noted that 15 of the 21 children required blood transfusions for anemia during treatment, and others had to have their treatment interrupted because of a drop in certain white blood cells. Two of the children in the study also developed opportunistic infections.    In reports prepared for presentation today, San Francisco researchers will report that 36% of that city's black residents and 13% of its Hispanic residents continue to use i.v. drugs or to engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners or partners at risk of AIDS.    This is despite recent street-corner education efforts, including a costumed campaigner called Mr. Bleach who advocates drug-needle sterilization and health tracts written as ethnic comic books.    The senior author of the reports, George W. Rutherford of the San Francisco Public Health Department, said that the number of people at risk was &quot;more than expected.&quot; His co-author George Lemp added that some warnings are reaching the minority community but that &quot;more information needs to be available in Spanish.&quot;    Addressing another area of great controversy, Dr. Rutherford expects to report that San Francisco's efforts to trace the sex partners of heterosexual and bisexual AIDS patients was laborious and expensive, costing $2,203 to find, interview, test and identify a single infected partner. Still, he said, the program is useful in helping to prevent perinatal transmission of AIDS to unborn children of women who might not otherwise know they were infected.    Babies of infected women stand a 40% to 50% chance of being born with the fatal virus. Because recent federal estimates of AIDS-care costs exceed $50,000 a patient, the program could become cost effective if it persuaded women to use birth control.    News on diagnostic testing came from a study at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. A recently announced genetic test by Cetus Corp. can detect which newborns are infected with AIDS and which ones only appear to be infected because they carry their mothers' antibodies.    Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute reported that a recently discovered human herpes virus called HHV-6 accelerates the cell-killing effect of the AIDS virus. He also confirmed reports from his lab that the skin malignancy Kaposi's sarcoma appears to result from an independent growth factor that causes an explosive growth of capillaries rather than from the AIDS virus directly. </TEXT></DOC>
