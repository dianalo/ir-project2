RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers may not be forced by federal law torepresent poor people in non-criminal federal cases, the SupremeCourt ruled today.   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of John A. Mallard, anattorney from rural Fairfield, Iowa, who specializes in businesscases. He had refused a federal judge's order to represent prisoninmates in a civil rights suit because he said he felt unqualifiedfor the assignment.   ``We do not mean to question, let alone denigrate, lawyers'ethical obligation to assist those who are too poor to affordcounsel,'' said Justice William J. Brennan for the court.   ``In a time when the need for legal services among the poor isgrowing and public funding for such services has not kept pace,lawyers' ethical obligation to volunteer their time and skills ...is manifest,'' he said.   But Brennan said the federal law is clear: lawyers may berequested to help _ not forced to do so.   The federal law authorizing legal help for poor people in civilcases specifically says a judge may ``request'' any attorney takethe case, Brennan noted.   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and JusticeByron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said Congressmay have used the word ``request'' but actually meant``respectfully command.''   ``In my opinion, Congress gave its endorsement to these judicialrequests, assuming that it would be unthinkable for a lawyer todecline without an adequate reason,'' Stevens said.   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmunand Sandra Day O'Connor.   Mallard, who argued his own case before the high court lastFebruary, had been ordered to represent two current inmates and aformer inmate at the Iowa state prison in Fort Madison.   The inmates said prison guards and officials filed falsedisciplinary reports against them, physically mistreated them andendangered their lives by revealing they were informants.   A federal judge picked Mallard in 1987 to represent them from alist of more than 100 lawyers compiled by the Legal Services Corp.of Iowa and the state's bar association.   In addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work,Mallard said the federal courts do not have power to require anunwilling attorney to represent someone in a civil case.   The possible penalties Mallard faced for his refusal to take theprison cases were not discussed. But presumably he could have beenheld in contempt and fined or even jailed had the Supreme Courtrejected his appeal.   Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendantsin criminal cases and the lawyers are paid, at taxpayer expense,generally a fraction of what they would receive normally.   In civil rights cases, lawyers are paid expenses and may receivea share of any damages won by their clients.   U.S. District Harold D. Vietor had denied Mallard's motion to beexcused from the inmates' suit. The judge said Mallard wascompetent and had trial experience.   The case is Mallard vs. U.S. District Court, 87-1490.</TEXT></DOC>
