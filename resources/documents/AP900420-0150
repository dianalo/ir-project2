Miss Taylor was battling pneumonia at St. John's Hospital andHealth Center in nearby Santa Monica. She remained in stablecondition Friday, her spokeswoman, Lisa Del Favaro, said from NewYork.   The illness is not believed to be linked to the prescriptions.   The 58-year-old actress was expected to remain hospitalizedthrough the weekend, said Ms. Del Favaro. She said Miss Taylor wasin good spirits, receiving a stream of cards and letters fromwell-wishers.   Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner declined toprosecute Drs. William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth,but will refer the case to the state medical board for possibledisciplinary action, the report said.   Messages left with the doctors' exchanges Friday were notimmediately returned.   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction tosleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems. Shewas treated at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage for alcoholand drug abuse that year.   From mid-1987 to October 1988, Skinner, Gottlieb and Roth weretreating Miss Taylor for a painful, chronic back condition andcumulative effects of addictive medication, the report stated.   Skinner is medical director of the chemical dependency center atSt. John's. Gottlieb is the immunologist who reported the firstAIDS cases in the United States, and Roth was once Gottlieb'spartner.   Skinner, who was instrumental in having Miss Taylor admitted tothe Ford clinic, wrote hundreds of the prescriptions investigated,Gottlieb wrote dozens and Roth wrote prescriptions infrequently,the report said.   Among drugs Skinner prescribed were Demerol, Percodan, Valium,Ativan, Xanax, Preludin and Dilaudin. Demerol is the brand name formeperidine, a strong narcotic analgesic similar to morphine.   The evidence concerning Miss Taylor's treatment was reviewed forReiner's office by Dr. David Smith, referred to in the report as anauthority in addiction medicine.   Smith found that ``over-prescribing was clearly documented,''the report stated, but it pointed out that the doctors also triedto ``detoxify the patient'' and to convince her to re-enter theFord Center in November 1988.   ``I recommend that some appropriate administrative action betaken so that the physicians in question, no matter how wellintended, learn that following appropriate prescribing guidelinescoupled with established principles of chemical dependency applyeven to a demanding, famous client,'' Smith wrote.   Dave Thornton, a senior investigator with the Board of MedicalQuality Assurance in Sacramento, said discipline could range from areprimand to license suspension.   Miss Taylor was hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 atDaniel Freeman Marina Hospital. She was transferred to St. John'son Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.   The actress had a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the yearshe won an Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.''</TEXT></DOC>
