MangunoStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST LABOR </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The big wage settlements being won by South Korean workers in their 10-week confrontation with management threaten to fuel inflation, push up unemployment and undermine the nation's competitiveness, government analysts say.    Already, the epidemic of more than 3,200 strikes that has swept the country since July 1 has cut production at factories and slowed the flow of South Korean cars, electronics and other exports that account for a quarter of the gross national product. Korea Development Institute, a government-sponsored think tank, says economic growth could fall as low as an annual rate of 5.7% in the second half from 15% in the first half.    &quot;The economy has been like bumper-to-bumper traffic going 55 miles an hour,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;Any accident and the freeway is bound to be tied up for hours.&quot;    Increasingly, though, government officials and corporate executives are looking beyond the immediate disruptions that the labor unrest is having on the economy to the longer-term impact that generous wage agreements could have. And much of what they see worries them.    The Korea Institute for Economics and Technology says if wage increases for striking workers average 10% in 1987's second half -- and they are currently averaging 15% -- export revenue for the year will fall by $1.27 billion. The institute has already lowered its forecast of exports by $2.5 billion to $42.5 billion because of lost production. (That figure would still be sharply higher than last year's $33.9 billion.)    If companies cut expenses to accommodate higher wages, they likely will do so by automating jobs and trimming the work force, analysts say. The institute estimates that more than 200,000 workers could be laid off by next June as a result of business failures and the loss of manufacturing jobs to automation.    The official unemployment rate is running at about 4%, up from 3.5% in July, and could reach 5% by the end of the year, Labor Ministry officials say. Moreover, their estimate may be on the low side, as the government counts anyone who works only a few hours a week as employed. Some economists say the real jobless rate could approach 10% by year's end.    Trade and Industry Minister Rha Woong Bae says he fears continued demands for higher wages will undermine the ability and willingness of businesses to invest. Most of the companies hit by the labor strife are operating on thin profit margins, and have borrowed heavily.    Borrowing more won't be easy. The government is pursuing tight-credit policies, though it has indicated it might loosen the reins a bit and increase emergency aid to struggling businesses. And foreign banks will be reluctant to step into the breach, Western bankers say.    &quot;It's like a house of cards being held by someone running on a treadmill,&quot; says Arjun Mathrani, director of Chase Manhattan Bank's Korea operations. &quot;It's that level of fragility.&quot;    Raising prices instead of increasing borrowing could boomerang. It would erode the major advantage that relatively less expensive Korean goods have had against exports of other newly industrialized countries -- an advantage that is already slipping away as the South Korean currency, the won, appreciates against the dollar.    &quot;The only thing Korea really has is a disciplined low-cost work force,&quot; says the manager of a Seoul-based U.S. bank. &quot;What else do they have? They don't have management experience. They don't have design. They don't have creativity. All they have is labor.&quot;    Government officials are also worried about the impact wage increases may have on domestic price increases. Some estimates say Korea's inflation rate could go as high as 5.8% this year, compared with 3% last year. This frightens policy makers more than most other considerations, because high inflation is a political liability -- especially in a presidential election year.    In the short term, some government economists aren't too concerned for the economy. The government says its pre-July forecast of $8 billion for this year's trade surplus, which would have represented a 63% increase over 1986, has been cut to $7 billion, which still represents a healthy 43% rise.    &quot;There is a tendency by the Korean government to hype the damage of the strikes,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;But that doesn't mean it won't have a serious economic impact in the long run.&quot;    Indeed, traders already are fretting over preliminary reports that South Korea has lost ground to two of the other &quot;Little Dragons&quot; of Asian exports -- Taiwan and Hong Kong -- in the two months since the labor unrest erupted.    In August, Trade Ministry officials say, companies managed to ship their products made in July or earlier. But with production slowed by the unrest and inventories drying up, exports for the month were way off target.    South Korea's auto industry will be paying heavily to end labor strife -- but at least it can afford the costs. The big auto makers -- Daewoo Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. -- have the money to absorb the extra expense, even though production losses have forced them to slash exports recently. Likewise, heavy-machinery makers are expected to be able to cope with the higher wages.    But electronics companies are operating on razor-thin profit margins as they try to build market share in the U.S. and other overseas markets. Two of Korea's leading home-appliance manufacturers -- Lucky-Goldstar International Corp. and Daewoo Electronics Co. -- between them failed to meet shipment dates for $154 million in goods, out of a total of $218 million scheduled for delivery.    And industries such as textiles and shipbuilding that were already on the skids may find their demise hastened, economists say.
