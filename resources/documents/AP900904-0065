(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Laura Washington, a smoky-voiced jazzvocalist who sang with Erskine Hawkins' orchestra on Broadway inthe 1940s and made the hit record ``I've Got A Right To Cry,'' hasdied of cancer. She was 64.   A memorial service was planned tonight for Miss Washington, whodied Thursday. Members of the Birmingham Heritage Band planned toplay an old Johnny Mercer ballad, ``Laura,'' in her memory.   Miss Washington made her debut at the Strand Theater on Broadwayin 1946, the same year she made ``I've Got A Right To Cry.'' Sheperformed in the 1940s as the only woman member of Hawkins'18-piece band.   In New York, Miss Washington met her idol, Ella Fitzgerald, andbecame friends with another Alabama native, blues singer DinahWashington.   ``Her whole style was similar to Ella's,'' said Birmingham jazzmusician J.L. Lowe.   Lowe, who discovered Miss Washington's singing talents as achild and later recommended her to Hawkins, said she could havebecome a jazz legend if she had not left her career in the 1950s toreturn to Birmingham to raise a family.   She did not sing professionally again for more than 25 years,until her children were grown and her husband, Julian Dash, haddied. She returned in the 1980s to perform weekends at a downtownclub, Grundy's.   ``Musicians who remembered her from the old days were astoundedto find out she still had that voice, even in her 60s,'' said Lowe.``Her voice was like an instrument. It was a gift.''</TEXT></DOC>
