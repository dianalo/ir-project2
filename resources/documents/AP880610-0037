The move Thursday was hailed by environmentalists and a nativeAlaskan fishermen's organization. It was a defeat for the Reaganadministration and the Commerce Department, which had issued thepermits for fishing with the gillnets.   ``We know at least we're not going to have this ecologicaldisaster played out in our waters this summer, and we're hopeful itis going to be stopped for good,'' said Alan Reichman, aSeattle-based spokesman for the Greenpeace environmental group.   The Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association andthe Reagan administration had asked the high court to overturn theinjunction and permit fishing to resume pending the high court'sconsideration of a formal appeal.   The Justice Department said preventing the Japanese from fishingfor salmon ``may prompt Japan to withdraw from the internationalconvention that currently prohibits Japanese fishermen from fishingfor North American salmon in a large area of the North Pacific.''   The order also will ``almost certainly lead to the removal fromJapanese fishing vessels of the United States observers who nowmonitor the incidental taking of marine mammals by Japanesefishermen,'' it said.   The injunction bars gillnet fishing by Japanese fleets duringthe June-July salmon season in an area of the Bering Sea and NorthPacific.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last February upheld a federaljudge's preliminary injunction halting gillnet fishing by theJapanese inside the zone.   The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, said a Commerce Departmentpermit to allow use of the nine-mile-long gillnets violated afederal animal protection law.   The permit would allow the unintentional catching in the nets of5,250 Dall's porpoise, plus seas lions, fur seals and killerwhales. The mammals become ensnared in the nets, which stretch forhundreds of miles.   The injunction in the case does not prevent the Japanese fromusing gillnets beyond the 200-mile protected zone.   The injunction was obtained by the Center for EnvironmentalEducation and the Kokechik Fishermen's Association.   Supporters of the ban said the government was exaggerating theimpact of the injunction.   They said the Japanese already had scaled down their fishingoperations in anticipation that the court ban would remain ineffect during the current season.   The environmentalists said if the injunction was lifted it``would have enormous and irreparable impact on marine mammals''within a 200-mile zone off the Alaska coast that is at issue in thedispute.   The cases are Secretary of Commerce vs. Kokechik Fishermen'sAssociation, A-906, and Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries vs.Kokechik, A-907.</TEXT></DOC>
