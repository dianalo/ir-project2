<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0393 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new kind of compliant, flexible, self-expanding stent prosthesis andan innovative delivery system specific to the device have been developed.Encouraging results in animal studies led to implantations in arteriovenousfistulas (n = 4), iliac and femoral arteries (n = 10), and coronary arteries(n = 10), with the goal of ensuring patency and preventing early restenosis.Early results, even of a relatively short-term and limited experience,confirm the ease and feasibility of the method. A multicenter trial willbe necessary to demonstrate the full therapeutic efficacy of the modeland method, but initial indications suggest that the system representsa major adjunct to angioplasty techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
