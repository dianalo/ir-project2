Six policemen have been killed in the province in the past week.   Police have not said whether the attacks on the policemen wereconnected, and the report of other killings Sunday gave fewdetails. Feuding among political groups, rural clans, and criminalgangs have claimed more than 3,000 lives in the Zulu areas of Natalin the past three years.   Most of the fighting has been between supporters of Inkatha _ aZulu political organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi _ andmembers of the banned United Democratic Front, a multiracialorganization.   The Front supporters oppose the participation of Buthelezi andInkatha in the KwaZulu homeland government; Buthelezi condemns theFront's use of boycotts and encouragement of economic sanctionsagainst South Africa. Buthelezi also opposes the guerrilla tacticsof the African National Congress, which is affiliated with theUnited Democratic Front.   African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu, recently freedfrom prison, blamed the Natal violence on the government's policyof dividing blacks into tribal homelands.   In a speech Sunday in Transkei, the homeland of the Xhosapeople, Sisulu said: ``The policy of divide and rule is one whichwe will destroy.'' He said the frequently interrupted attempts tobring the Natal factions together in peace talks had been``resuscitated.''   Police headquarters in Pretoria said Monday that 10 blackcivilians had been killed in Natal in the past 24 hours.   Also, police said, a black municipal policeman was hit on thehead with a blunt instrument and killed Sunday in the township ofSteadville, near Ladysmith; a black sergeant was shot to death bythree blacks as he got into his car after visiting a colleague inGamalakhe, near Port Shepstone on Saturday night; and a reserveconstable was surrounded by a group of 15 blacks and stabbed todeath as he left a rural homestead near Inanda on Friday night.   The report said most of the violence occurred at KwaMashu, ablack township on the outskirts of the Indian Ocean city of Durban,where 25,000 people had marched to the police station Sunday topresent a petitition accusing the police of brutality. UnitedDemocratic Front supporters say most KwaZulu police favor Inkatha,and Buthelezi is the chief of the homeland police.   Police did not say whether the violence preceded or followed themarch, but one man was found stabbed to death, one beaten to deathand two burnt to death. A black constable, defending himselfagainst a crowd, fired birdshot, killing a man, police said. Twoother men and a 15-year-old boy were stabbed by crowds in threeseparate incidents, police said.
