 Of course, putting a bucketunder a drip is less taxing than restructuring and retyping a couple ofthousand pages of data.andM;But you already know that.andP;  So, let's assume you already accept theinevitability of a hard disk crash.andP;  You've been lucky so far, or maybe youcan't face spending your weekends backing up your new 100Mb disk to floppies.andO;What alternatives do you have?andP;  Many.andP;  The more-exotic forms of backupstorage--the Bernoulli Box, mirror image drives, erasable opticalstorage--are expensive and more than most personal users and small businessesneed.andP;  That leaves the old standby: tape drives.andM;There are many questions about tape drives: What's compatible?andP;  What's not?andO;What do all of those QIC numbers mean, anyway?andP;  I'll try to answer these andalso look at a couple of QIC-40 tape drives, Colorado Memory Systems' Jumbo120 and the Irwin Magnetic Systems' SXe.andP;  The aim, however, is to make thepoint that when shopping for tape backup at the low end of the spectrum, theQIC-40 drives are a lot alike, regardless of the manufacturer.andM;Tape Drives: Not Fancy, But They WorkandM;They may not be showy, but you can pick up tape drives and the necessarysoftware at reasonable prices.andP;  You can find a DC2000 drive with software for$300 or less; a higher capacity (up to 525Mb) DC6000--formerly known asDC600--with slightly larger and more-costly tape cartridges, for $500 to$1,500.andP;  Driven by your current floppy controller or by faster dedicatedones, these drives are still the mainstay of backup.andM;The problem with these devices isn't cost or complexity, but figuring out thecontinuing avalanche of letters, numbers, and &quot;standards.&quot;andM;The quarter-inch drive guidelines (called QIC) were outlined several yearsago by a consortium of manufacturers looking to standardize tape-driveformats in order to provide the consistency necessary to allow drives madeunder similar standards to be read by other manufacturers' machines.andP;  Theysucceeded fairly well.andP;  The original QIC-40 format (40Mb capacity) for DC2000drives has expanded to include a host of others, and now incorporates DC6000drives.andM;The accompanying table lists QIC formats and downward compatibility.andP;  Butcompatibility isn't absolute.andM;With a few exceptions, all QIC-40 tapes can be read by all other QIC-40drives.andP;  The same is true for the QIC-80 format.andP;  Compatibility results fromuse of the same physical (track position, width, etc.) and logical (position,order, and interpretation of data on the tape) format.andM;Other QIC formats use the same physical format, but the logical one oftendiffers from drive to drive and software to software.andP;  Thus, a DC6000 QIC-120tape may be readable by another manufacturer's QIC-120 and QIC-24 hardwareand software.andP;  Then again, it may not.andM;For instance, Irwin drives have long had a proprietary format.andP;  They stilldo, in spite of the fact that the SXe, reviewed here, is billed as a QIC-40drive.andP;  Irwin's products are exceptions to the universal compatibility ofQIC-40 and QIC-80 drives.andM;Many tape-drive manufacturers use SYSTOS or SYSTOS Plus software by theSytron Corporation.andP;  Theory has it that any tape made on a QIC drive usingSYSTOS software should be readable by any compatible QIC drive, but don't betthe farm on it.andP;  Identical drives and software are the only sure route tocompatibility.andM;Backup Software: The Crucial IngredientandM;Tape-drive technology has been around long enough to wipe out the bugs thatoften plague new equipment.andP;  Most of the drives on the market aremechanically solid.andP;  Fortunately, the same can be said of the software thatmakes the drives work.andM;Even so, there are some cautions.andP;  The software packaged with the drives isprobably the software you are stuck with.andP;  There are many packages around,but there is no assurance that foreign software will work on your drive.andO;Irwin bundles Central Point 6.0 backup software, an excellent package, withthe SXe.andP;  But in spite of Central Point's assertion that it does work withthe Colorado Systems' Jumbo 120 drive, it didn't.andP;  Apparently, Central Pointwill work with some Jumbo 120 hardware, but it won't recognize the FC-10controller used with the Jumbo.andM;The Moral of the StoryandM;Make sure the software packaged with the drive you buy is software you canlive with.andP;  Here are some things to look for.andM;Backup speed is crucial if your need for data security is such that you can'tlet the drive and software do its thing in the dead of night.andP;  Backing up a40Mb hard drive to a QIC-40 drive can take from 10 minutes to an hour ormore.andP;  Some drives--including both reviewed here--offer dedicated controllercards, which speed backup considerably.andM;Be aware that data compression, which can save 40 percent or more in tapespace, will substantially slow backup on 8088 or 80286 PCs, but will havelittle effect on a 386.andP;  If you plan to use unattended backup, be sure thesoftware supports starting the backup at a preset time.andP;  If you use thisoption, you need to make sure the backup will span no more than one tape,making the amount of data compression crucial.andP;  If you have a large harddrive and don't want to wait around to insert a new tape, look at ahigher-capacity (and more-expensive) tape drive.andM;Incredibly, backup software that won't allow a backup to span more than onetape still exists.andP;  Always check.andM;The software must be able to make file-by-file backups and allow restorationof selected files.andP;  Earlier backup software often used an &quot;image&quot; backup,which lifted data from the drive exactly as it was found--fragmented files,lost clusters, erased space, everything--and required a tape at least aslarge as the drive being backed up.andP;  Some software allows only imagerestoration to the same hard drive from which the backup was made.andP;  This isnot acceptable.andM;File-by-file backups are sequential, using only as much tape space as thereis data on the hard disk.andP;  Selective restoration is essential in case youneed to retrieve just one file or subdirectory.andM;Finally, chances are that your present system will support whatever DC2000drive you choose when using the existing floppy controller, though you mayhave to buy some adapter cables, especially if your system has two floppydrives.andP;  A few DC2000 and all DC6000 drives require a separate controller,and many DC2000 manufacturers offer optional cards for increased speed.andO;Before shopping, check the name of your present floppy drive controller andalways ask the cost of optional cards.andM;Marketing hype not withstanding, there is no great difference between the SXeand Jumbo 120.andP;  Both meet all of the prudent-shopper criteria outlined above,and both support extended-length tapes, which--with data compression--allowthe potential storage of 120Mb of data on one tape (80Mb to 100Mb is theusual limit).andM;The software of both systems allows selective backup and recovery.andP;  The Jumbo120 can use either the existing floppy drive controller (for internalinstallation) or its own dedicated adapter card for increased speed.andP;  TheSXe, installable only externally, comes with an adapter card.andP;  Both drivescan be configured for use with PS/2 or Micro Channel systems.andM;The Irwin SXeandM;As mentioned, this external drive is billed as a QIC-40, which, according toIrwin, eliminates the time-consuming servo-writing necessary on other Irwindrives.andP;  It does not imply compatibility: Irwin's SXe is still a proprietaryformat.andM;Even so, the SXe is a solid piece of equipment.andP;  At a list price of $599,which includes the required SXL20a adapter card, it's only slightly moreexpensive than the Jumbo 120, and includes the Central Point 6.0 backupsoftware, an excellent and versatile package.andM;Installation is easy.andP;  Find a slot for the card and a drive-power connectorfrom the power supply (an adapter is supplied so the SXe can share power witha floppy drive if there is no spare power connector).andP;  The software installsautomatically and is easy to follow.andP;  Intuitive menus offer a choice of threedifferent levels of expertise and come with an error-recovery option thatallows recovery of errors on the tape.andM;For the prudent or insecure, Central Point offers the option of automaticallycomparing the original to the backup, thus insuring maximum accuracy, butgreatly slowing the backup process.andP;  Irwin says that their SXe tapes need noservo-writing, but Central Point reports that it does something which takes18 minutes, added to the 58-minute format time.andM;SXe and Central Point do the job they're supposed to do with a minimum offuss.andP;  Setup is quick, and with the exception of tape changes, backups areaccomplished automatically.andM;This backup system is based on the tape-drive module, which comes out of thebox configured for internal installation using an existing floppy controller.andO;If your system has an open-drive bay, one floppy, and you can put up with theconsiderably slower backup resulting from using a floppy controller, theJumbo 120 is all you need.andM;If you must (or want to) install the system externally, you'll need the$169.95 KE10 kit, which contains external housing, cables, and a dedicatedadapter card.andP;  As a result, the Jumbo 120 is almost the same price as theSXe.andP;  Its software isn't as flashy as the Central Point package, but it doesthe job just as well.andM;Jumbo software installation was easy; hardware installation was a little moredifficult.andP;  Coupling the drive with the external housing required keepingcables out of the way of the little fan--not an easy task, but possible withpatience.andM;ConclusionsandM;There isn't much difference between the two drives.andP;  Both systems backed up ahard disk containing about 45Mb in approximately 12 minutes.andP;  Restoration ofindividual files took almost the same amount of time.andP;  Both performed backupat unattended preset times without flaw.andM;The roughly equivalent price makes the choice difficult.andP;  For its ease ofinstallation, the SXe gets the nod.andP;  However, the modular concept of theJumbo, which can expand with your system, can't be overlooked.andM;The choice?andP;  A toss-up.andM;Steve Gilliland, a computer consultant and writer since 1981, is a formerchairman of the Department of Computer Education at Sioux Empire College inIowa.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
