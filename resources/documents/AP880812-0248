The banks raised their base lending rates by a half-percentagepoint to 10 percent on Thursday _ a more than 3-year high _ inreaction to the Federal Reserve's drive to push all interest rateshigher to curb inflation.   The prime rate increase, the second in a month, puts the keylending rate in double-digit territory for the first time sinceJune 1985.   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-andadjustable-rate loans, the change will affect consumers who alreadyhave seen borrowing costs rise in recent months.   A higher prime rate will affect small- to medium-sizedbusinesses and consumers more so than large corporations, whichborrow more cheaply in the open market by issuing commercial paper,or short-term unsecured IOUs.   Home equity lines of credit usually are pegged to the primerate, while many adjustable-rate home mortgages are tied tointerest paid on Treasury bills.   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,said higher borrowing costs may have a significant effect on thespending habits of consumers, who have been buying on credit inincreasing numbers lately.   ``If you have to pay more (for loans) then you have less moneyto buy things like furniture, clothing ... and other littleniceties,'' she said.   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in itstracks,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for theinvestment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's ahealthy thing right now.   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That'spreventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing,'' Brusca said.   Financial markets took Thursday's news in stride afterweathering the storm that followed the Fed's increase in a keylending rate earlier in the week.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closedup 5.16 to 2,039.30. Bond prices, which generally decline in theface of rising interest rates, ended mixed.   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,although some European traders credited the prime rate hike forpreventing a free fall.   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the prime hikeThursday morning, with other major banks across the country quicklyfollowing suit.   The increase brings the prime to its highest level since June18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent.   The prime was at 8.5 percent at the beginning of the year. Thebanks raised it to 9 percent on May 11 and then to 9.5 percent onJuly 14.   Economists widely had anticipated the latest boost the Fedsignaled its desire to tighten credit on Tuesday by raising itsdiscount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, citing inflationarypressures. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges onloans to member banks.   Economists said the subsequent boost in the prime reflected therising of borrowing costs faced by the banks. Rates banks pay onproducts such as certificates of deposits or money market accountshave been forced up, although not at the same pace as bank loans.   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailingconcerns in the credit markets that the economy might beoverheating and inflation creeping up. Higher inflation erodes thevalue of fixed-rate investments such as Treasury bonds, forcingborrowers to pay higher interest rates to attract investors.   Many analysts predict interest rate will continue to head higherbut discount a big increase.</TEXT></DOC>
