Deichert said that nothing had changed in the months sinceHastings had ordered two brothers, Thomas and Frank Romano, toforfeit the money as proceeds from racketeering operations.``Everything was identical and out of the blue he was reversinghimself,'' he said.   Deichert was the leadoff witness at the evidence hearings atwhich members of the House acting as prosecutors promised to provethat Hastings conspired to get a $150,000 payoff to keep the Romanobrothers out of prison and restore their money to them.   The Romano brothers never took part in any such plot and bothhave died since their December 1980 racketeering convictionfollowing a trial at which Hastings was the judge and Deichert wasthe prosecutor.   Hastings is accused of taking part in a plot with Washingtonattorney William Borders in which a go-between carrying messages tothe Romanos was actually taking orders from the strike force and anFBI undercover agent posed as one of the brothers.   By coincidence, Hastings' trial in the Senate got under way onthe day that U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar entered pleas ofinnocent in San Francisco to eight charges relating to accusationsthat he used his office to do favors for convicted felons. It wasthe fourth indictment of a federal judge in the decade of the 1980sand the first to involve racketeering charges.   ``Judge Hastings' actions ... present a pattern of misconductwhich cannot be tolerated in a United States district judge,'' Rep.John Bryant, D-Texas, said as hearings got under way.   Hastings also is accused of lying to the federal jury thatacquitted him of criminal charges in the matter in 1983 andimproperly disclosing information obtained from a federal wiretap.   Hastings was impeached by the House a year ago. If convicted bythe Senate he would be removed from the U.S. District Court benchand deprived of his $89,500 annual salary.   Much of the opening remarks of both House Judiciary Committeemembers who are serving as prosecutors and the judge's own attorney,Terence Anderson of Miami, represented a review of material that hasbecome familiar in Congress over the last two years.   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' Hastings told reporters in ahallway outside the hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building.He also called the proceeding ``an abomination'' because theyconsisted of ``the same old stuff, and I really resent it, quitefrankly.''   The Senate is holding the evidentiary hearings before a specialcommittee rather than tie up the floor for weeks and thus preventaction on legislation.   The proceedings are being videotaped for the viewing of othersenators who evntually will vote on the floor on whether to convictHastings.   The Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) carried theproceedings to cable viewers nationwide.   Bryant, lead counsel for the House, said that the Senate shouldexpel Hastings from the federal bench despite his 1983 acquittal. Hesaid the ``acquittal was the product of repeated lies and theproduction of fabricated evidence at his criminal trial.''   ``It is an acquittal that cannot be overturned,'' Bryant said.``Judge Hastings cannot be prosecuted again. But he can be removedfrom office.''   Hastings' attorney portrayed his client as the innocent dupe ofWashington attorney William Borders, whom he described as ``a bigtime rainmaker'' with career criminals for friends.   ``Alcee L. Hastings was, is, and will forever be an innocentman,'' declared Anderson as the dapper judge looked on impassively.   Anderson also attacked another potential witness, William Dredge,as ``a big-time fence'' and ``career informant'' who was desperateto provide the FI with evidence against ``a big fish'' to keep outof prison himself.   Dredge is expected to testify on Tuesday behind closed doors in ahigh-security hearing room designed for the Senate IntelligenceCommittee.   Reporters and cameras will be barred. ``He fears retaliation,''Bryant told newsmen, because he has been a government witness in amajor labor racketeering trial involving top Cosa Nosa hoodlums.   ``We don't want anyone to see his face,'' Bryant said.   Borders, who wielded considerable political influence in the1970s, was convicted of bribery-conspiracy after pulling out of asuburban Virginia motel parking garage with a clothing bag stuffedwith $125,000 in cash and an FBI undercover agent posing as acriminal by his side.   Hastings, in Washington at the time for a testimonial dinnerhonoring Borders, quickly hopped a plane for Florida after learningof the arrest. FBI agents found him later that night in hisattorney's home in Miami.   Bryant said the hasty exit was evidence of Hastings' guilt, butAnderson scoffed at that, saying the judge ``spent two hours withthe FBI'' that night, ``and he responded to every one of theirquestions.''   ``He was not an avaricious man,'' Anderson declared. ``...This isnot a man who set out to make money.''</TEXT></DOC>
