The AFL-CIO, which represents about 14 million workers,said the numbers demonstrate the need to strengthen lawsgoverning workplace safety.   Nearly half of the 1990 cases were serious enough torequire workers to lose time on the job or have their workactivity restricted, the department said.   Eight industries reported at least 100,000 injury caseseach. Those were eating and drinking places, hospitals,grocery stores, trucking and over-the-road couriers, nursingand personal-care facilities, department stores, motorvehicle manufacturing and hotels and motels.   Though manufacturing cases were down slightly, falling36,000 to 2.4 million cases, factory cases still made up forabout a third of the total. Manufacturing accounts for about20% of private industry employment. In contrast, servicesindustries had about 30% of employment and about 20% of theinjury cases, the agency said.</TEXT></DOC>
