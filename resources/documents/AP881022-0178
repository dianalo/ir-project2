In the past week, two of the biggest buyouts in history havebeen suggested. Philip Morris Companies Inc. proposed an $11.4billion takeover of Kraft Inc., and RJR Nabisco Inc. said itsmanagement is considering taking the company private in a $17.6billion deal.   That kind of talk is bad news for those holding a buyer's bondsbecause chances are the buyer will take on a lot more debt toaccomplish the deal.   Suddenly the company that looked so solid when it sold the bondsthat individual and institutional investors now hold in theirportfolios doesn't look like such a great credit risk anymore.   News of the latest potential buyouts sent prices reeling andyields higher on billions of dollars in debt from Philip Morris andRJR Nabisco.   Dealers said the price of long bonds from RJR, for instance,tumbled about 14 points, or $140 for every $1,000 in face value,after word of the possible buyout reached the market. As prices ofits bonds fell, their yields rocketed nearly two percentage pointsto about 11.9 percent.   But the announcements had a broader impact, putting downwardpressure on corporate bond prices generally as speculation flaredabout which other companies could be next, analysts said.   That's a big difference between this and earlier buyout waves,said Ronald Morse, senior vice president in charge of corporate andgovernment bond trading at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Morse said recent buyouts of a number of retailing firms mainlyaffected only the bond prices of the companies involved.   ``The opinion going into 1988 was that there are some companiesthat are just too big to be put into play and their debt securitieswere safe from event risk, the event being a takeover or leveragedbuyout,'' he said.   But he said the latest buyout wave has ``substantially destroyedthis article of faith.''   As a result, he said this past week's developments made someinvestors wonder about the chances that the companies whose bondsthey hold may become involved in a similar situation, either asaggressor or target.   James Ednie, corporate vice president and senior industrial bondtrader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said another reason for thedecline in corporate bond prices is that some big investors such aspension funds are required to invest only in securities carryingthe higher credit ratings.   When it appears a company may face a ratings downgrade, he saidthese bondholders often scramble to sell those securities andreinvest in higher-grade issues such as Treasury or utility bonds.   ``One of the most common realities in leveraged buyouts is thatthey tend to turn double-A and single-A credits into new credits ofless than investment grade,'' Ednie said.   The two major debt ratings agencies, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. andMoody's Investors Service, said that they were monitoring PhilipMorris and RJR to see if a reduction in rating is warranted.   Dean Witter's Morse said one likely impact of merger mania willbe that those who buy bonds will demand greater assurance from theissuer that they will be able to sell their bonds for a fair priceif the issuer later decides for whatever reason to load up on moredebt.   Morse said some companies have attached so-called poison-putoptions to their bond issues, giving bondholders the right to sellthe bonds back to the issuer at specified terms if the issuerbecomes involved in a buyout.   Corporate managements generally don't like such provisionsbecause it limits their ability to make moves without incurring asizeable liability to buy back outstanding debt.   But Morse said since the notion that some deals are too big tobe done has been called into question, companies may find they mustoffer some protection to find ready buyers for their debt.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Oct. 22-23</NOTE></DOC>
