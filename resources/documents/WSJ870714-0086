A year earlier, the defense, electronics, broadcasting and financial services concern earned $163.1 million, or $1.05 a share. Year-ago net included a pre-tax gain of $651 million from the sale of its cable television business, which was offset by a $790 million provision to cover a restructuring program. Sales in the latest quarter were $2.64 billion, down from $2.73 billion.    Profit was in line with analysts' expectations that Westinghouse would earn between $1.20 and $1.27 a share in the quarter. In the latest quarter, Westinghouse had 144.9 million shares outstanding, down from 155 million a year earlier. &quot;It looks like it was an excellent quarter,&quot; said Gail Landis, of Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. She noted the strong improvement in the company's operating profit margin during the quarter, to 8.8% from 7.4% last year. Analysts also said the quarter's sales were flat when considering the absence of the cable operations.    Westinghouse said that operating profit increased in all segments except for broadcasting, which was even with last year despite the absence of cable TV operating profit. Analysts said company officials indicated that operating profit grew well over 20% for the commercial segment and by 10% to 15% for the industrial segment. The energy and advanced technology segment showed a fairly modest rise, they said.    In the first half, net income rose 11% to $331.5 million, or $2.30 a share, from $298.3 million, or $1.93 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 6.1% to $4.96 billion from $5.29 billion.    &quot;The first half met our expectations,&quot; said Douglas D. Danforth, chairman, &quot;and we are on target for the full year.&quot;    Ms. Landis said she expects the company to earn $5.32 a share for the year, up from the $4.42 earned in 1986.    Westinghouse shares closed yesterday at $65, off 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
