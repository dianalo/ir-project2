New York, plagued by troubled schools and sky-high wages, wasnot included in the magazine's top-10 city list this year afterranking No. 6 last year.   The current top-10 list, published in Fortune's Oct. 22 issue,will hit most newsstands on Oct. 8.   The magazine said the survey was based partly on a pollconducted by the relocation consulting firm of Moran Stahl andamp; Boyer,which queried personnel executives in the 50 largest metropolitanareas. Fortune also said the rankings were based on its owninterviews with hundreds of business and community leaders andgovernment officials.   Fortune said it changed the criteria from last year to putgreater stress on education and the quality of the workforce. Lastyear's broader quality-of-life criteria put Dallas, Atlanta andKansas City at the top of the list.   This year's leader, Salt Lake City, was singled out for its highliteracy rate and overall quality of life. The survey added thatits sedate downtown should be invigorated soon by a planned $500million redevelopment.   Others in the top-ten, in order:   - Minneapolis-St. Paul - ``among America's cleanest, safestmetropolitan areas'';   - Atlanta - ``fine climate, affordable housing, first-classinternational airport and rapid transit, scores of golf courses'';   - Sacramento, Calif. - ``homes at half the price of SanFrancisco and Los Angeles and generally better schools'';   - Austin, Texas - ``better schools and lower labor costs thanits bigger sisters Dallas and Houston'';   - Columbus, Ohio - ``affordable housing and good schools in anethnically diverse city'';   - Dallas-Fort Worth - ``affordable homes, low state and localtaxes,andthe smell of economic recovery'';   - Phoenix - ``schools excel, workers are well educated, and alarge community college system answers business's needs'';   - Jacksonville, Fla. - ``schools aren't exceptional...butFlorida's generous job training programs and low taxes helpcompensate'';   - Oklahoma City - ``real estate markets are a buyer'sparadise...and city and state offer some of America's best jobtraining and adult education.''   Seattle, which didn't make Fortune's list, was rated the bestplace to locate in an annual survey of 400 business executivesreleased Tuesday by the commercial real estate firm of Cushman andamp;Wakefield. Fortune's No. 1 choice didn't make the Cushman andamp;Wakefield survey.</TEXT></DOC>
