On other markets, precious metals prices also fell sharply;soybean futures plunged while grains finished lower; livestock, meatand energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.   The spot copper price on New York's Commodity Exchange fell 8.75cents _ the steepest one-day decline in the Comex spot coppercontract since Feb. 1 _ to $1.4325 a pound, more than 10 cents belowthe record high of $1.538 established on Nov. 2.   The most active contract, for delivery in December, tumbled 8.85cents to $1.3675 a pound.   The sell-off was prompted by a midday report that Southern PeruCopper, the biggest copper-mining firm in the world's sixth-largestcopper-producing country, had come to terms with striking clericaland white-collar employees, analysts said.   The company's miners remained on strike but company officialsreportedly said they may reach an agreement with them by Monday. Theworkers have been on strike since Oct. 18.   Earlier in the day, Southern Peru declared ``force majeure'' onshipments of 3,000 metric tons of copper to European customers,meaning it would be unable to honor those commitments, and saidshipments of another 4,000 metric tons would be delayed.   But the copper market failed to rally on that ostensibly bullishnews.   The strike has been a major factor in the copper market's surgeto record highs. And while worldwide supplies are expected to remaintight well into next year, the market's behavior may indicate thatthe dramatic rally has peaked, analysts said.   ``Whether they're moving close to a settlement or not, thisraises a flag: has the top been put in or not,'' said Craig Sloane,a metals market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in NewYork.   ``Today feels more like we've topped than any other day we'vehad,'' he said. ``This is how the market acts when it's at the top.''   Precious-metals futures prices also fell sharply, partly onprofit-taking ahead of the Veterans' Day bank holiday on Friday andpartly in reaction to a rise in short-term interest rates, analystssaid.   On the Comex, gold settled $4.10 to $4.50 lower with December at$420.50 a troy ounce; silver was 13.7 cents to 14.6 cents lower withDecember at $6.44 a troy ounce.   Soybean futures prices plunged on heavy selling near the close oftrading on the Chicago Board of Trade, dragging down wheat and oatprices and spurring further declines in an already weak corn market.   The collapse apparently was triggered by a massive sell orderfrom the Iowa Grain Co., a large commodities brokerage firm that hadpurchased about 5 million bushels of soybeans early in the sessionand sold them all back shortly before the close, analysts said.   The corn market had been weak all day in response to a slightincrease in the Agriculture Department's estimate for 1988 U.S. cornproduction.   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with the contract fordelivery in December at 4.24} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 5 centslower with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 7{cents lower with December at $2.15{ a bushel; and soybeans were 13cents to 27\ cents lower with November at $7.73 a bushel.   In livestock and meat futures trading on the Chicago MercantileExchange, live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .03 cent higher withDecember at 72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lowerto .23 cent higher with November at 81.10 cents a pound; live hogswere .70 cent lower to .55 cent higher with December at 40.72 centsa pound; and frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .53 cent lowerwith February at 44.12 cents a pound.
