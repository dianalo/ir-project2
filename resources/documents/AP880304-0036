But the 11 percent increase in methane in the past decade alsomay slow depletion of the ozone shield over the rest of the planet,said F. Sherwood Rowland and Donald R. Blake, chemists at theUniversity of California at Irvine.   Their NASA-funded study was published today in the journalScience.   Methane is the major component of natural gas, but about 80percent of atmospheric methane comes from decomposition in ricepaddies, swamps and the intestines of cows, with some contributionfrom wood digestion in termites, Rowland said.   Humans are responsible for increased methane levels because theyare raising more cows, growing more rice and chopping down tropicalforests, which provides food for more termites, said atmosphericscientist Pat Zimmerman of the National Center for AtmosphericResearch in Boulder, Colo.   Researchers generally agree that by trapping solar heat likeglass in a greenhouse, methane, carbon dioxide and pollutants arelikely to warm Earth's lower atmosphere by 3 to 5 degrees by theyear 2050.   They fear this ``greenhouse effect'' may cause crop-threateningdroughts and partially melt polar ice caps, which could raise sealevels up to 15 feet and threaten coastal cities.   Ozone is an air pollutant at low altitudes, but in thestratosphere it shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.Scientists say reduction of the ozone layer will cause more skincancers and might trigger climatic changes.   In 1974, Rowland and chemist Mario Molina first warned that theozone layer was threatened by man-made chlorine compounds calledchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are used as refrigerationcoolants, aerosol propellants and for making plastic foams. TheUnited States banned spray-can CFCs in 1978.   Mounting evidence indicates CFCs are responsible for theworldwide loss of about 1 percent of Earth's ozone shield and theformation of a hole that forms in the ozone layer above Antarcticafor a few months starting every September.   Blake and Rowland said methane increases may worsen the ozonehole by aiding formation of ice clouds above Antarctica. That'sbecause studies by Molina and others suggest the clouds enhancechemical reactions that allow chlorine from CFCs to break downozone.   As methane rises into the polar stratosphere, it breaks down andreleases hydrogen, which combines with a chemical called hydroxylto form water, which in turn freezes into clouds, Blake explained.   Outside Antarctica, wind and higher temperatures preventformation of stratospheric clouds, so methane attacks chlorine fromCFCs, reducing the amount of chlorine available to destroy ozone,Blake said.   The 11 percent methane increase ``will make the ozone hole overAntarctica more severe. It will probably make the ozone depletionin the rest of the world less severe,'' said Molina, of theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena.   He said the increase ``will make the greenhouse effect moresevere.''   Rowland and Blake also said that because increasing atmosphericmethane reduces the amount of hydroxyl present, it indicates theatmosphere is losing its ability to cleanse itself of pollutants.Hydroxyl reacts with many pollutants and removes them from theatmosphere.   Their study also indicates the rate of increase in methane gasslowed slightly during the past five years.   Blake and Rowland collected air samples regularly betweenJanuary 1978 and September 1987 at up to 60 locations around thePacific to measure methane levels.   Earlier studies suggested methane levels more than doubledduring the previous 200 years. Based on that, Blake and Rowlandcalculated methane increases may have raised the amount of watervapor in the stratosphere by 28 percent since the 1940s and by 45percent over the past two centuries.</TEXT></DOC>
