The sale ends one of the strangest alliances in thecomputer industry in recent years -- one in which ATandamp;T tappedSun for marketing and technical help for ATandamp;T's bumblingcomputer effort, including promotion of the Unix softwaresystem that ATandamp;T had invented. For its part, Sun had soughtan infusion of capital to help fund its rapid ascent to thetop of the high-performance computer workstation industry.</LP><TEXT>   Under the agreement, Sun bought about five million of itscommon shares for $36.25 a share from ATandamp;T. Sun will use theshares in its employee stock benefit programs. ATandamp;T saidanother 11 million shares were purchased by Salomon BrothersInc. at the same price and will be resold to institutionalbuyers. The two transactions will result in a pretax gain toATandamp;T of about $137 million. ATandamp;T said its remaining threemillion shares, or about 3% of Sun, must be sold tounspecified buyers at a later date under federalrestrictions.   Robert M. Kavner, ATandamp;T group executive for Data Systemsand Federal Systems, said the Sun alliance &quot;accelerated thedevelopment of the newest version of the UNIX system, earnedus a profit on our investment {and} Sun received significantinvestment funds.&quot;   Scott McNealy, chairman, president and CEO of SunMicrosystems, Mountain View, Calif., said Sun's&quot;relationships with ATandamp;T in many areas remain strong as acustomer, supplier and technology partner.&quot;   However, while the ATandamp;T-Sun alliance managed to come upwith a standardized Unix embraced by at least part of thecomputer industry, analysts said it fell far short of itsgoal to develop new hardware and software products and imbueATandamp;T with much needed marketing finesse. ATandamp;T will now leavethat up to NCR.   &quot;The original goals {of the ATandamp;T-Sun combination} werevery broad,&quot; said David M. Card, an analyst at InternationalData Corp., Framingham, Mass. &quot;Sun and ATandamp;T were going toredistribute the wealth in the computer industry . . . but itnever happened. Instead, they helped bring together the OpenSoftware Foundation {of rival computer companies} unitedagainst Sun.&quot;   Sun also failed to make its Sparc microprocessor anindustry-standard chip for the new wave of powerful desktopcomputers using RISC, or reduced instruction set computingtechnology. When it came time for ATandamp;T to market a powerfulminicomputer, instead of developing its own machine based onthe Sparc chip, it bought a system manufactured by PyramidTechnology Corp., which used a rival's RISC chip.   Still, the financial gain from its investment will bringATandamp;T some much needed profits after seven years and more than$2 billion in computer losses.   ATandamp;T began purchasing its Sun stake in January 1988,several months after the two companies stunned the computerindustry with their announcement that they would team up toproduce a new version of the Unix software and promote it asa standard. In numerous transactions over the next threeyears -- including six directly with Sun -- ATandamp;T paid a total$517 million for its 19% of Sun.   Some ties that bind ATandamp;T and Sun will continue at leastfor the near term. ATandamp;T supplies custom microchips and itsStarLAN local area network systems to Sun while Sun sells itspowerful workstations to ATandamp;T. And the two companies remainallies through Unix Systems Laboratories Inc., which ATandamp;Tspun off earlier this year to several partners, includingSun.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,ATandamp;T shares closed at $36.875, down 25 cents. Sun sharesclosed at $36.50, down 37.5 cents in nationalover-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
