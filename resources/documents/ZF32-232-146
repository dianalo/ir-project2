 There are many pros and cons involved.andP;  X terminalcritics are quick to point out their drain on network resources.andP;  However,some recent developments in X terminal technology--especially innetworking--are making them a more viable option for organizations ready toplunge wholeheartedly into X.andM;FIRST, THE CONS.andP;  Despite the fact that X terminals are relativelyinexpensive (you can buy a decent black-and-white model for less than$2,000), they can exhaust a network.andP;  Typically, the host needs to keep acopy of the window manager for each X terminal it serves.andP;  Window managersuse about 225K of memory--and that can really add up.andP;  (Consider that anaverage X environment can include about 100 terminals.)andP;  Of course, the hostcan use share libraries to cut down on memory, but there's still a networkcongestion problem because the terminals need to access the client each timea user merely moves a window or pushes a button.andP;  Furthermore, if theterminals are not configured with EPROMS (a memory chip version of the Xserver), the host must download the entire X server each time an X terminalstarts up.andM;Therefore, many organizations are planning to rely on workstations and PCsinstead.andM;THE PROS.andP;  But recent X terminal technology might change these plans.andP;  NCD,the largest X terminal vendor, has effectively solved the problem of tying upmemory for multiple copies of the window manager.andP;  The company recentlydeveloped a window manager (NCDwm) tha resides on the X terminal rather thanthe host.andP;  NCDwm is part of the server--either on the server binary file thatis downloaded from the host or included in the EPROM configuration.andP;  Thus,the X terminal doesn't rely on the host for window operations, therebyimproving performance and cutting down substantially on network cost.andP;  NCDwmhas the behavior and appearance of the Motif window manager, but NCD claimsthat it's smaller, so it takes up less room--again, saving memory.andP;  Thebottom line is that the local window manager can save up to 1MB of memory perX terminal.andP;  Another big plus is that you can use NCD X terminals to accesshosts that don't run the X Window system.andP;  Since these terminals carry bothan emulator and window manager, they don't depend on the host for windowmanagement.andP;  You can even run PC applications on these machines.andM;NCD has done some impressive work here.andP;  The only shortcoming is that NCDwmhas no window manager config file, which somewhat limits its configurability.andO;But you should still be able to change all the typical window attributes,such as window borders, color, menus, buttons, etc.andM;NCDwm is part of NCD's latest release of its X server software.andP;  In additionto the local window manager, NCDWare 2.3 also features:andM;* A remote reset, which lets administrators restart NCD servers from a remotesiteandM;* Support for MIT's X11R4 authentication schemeandM;* Support for up to eight local X clientsandM;* Compatibility with Ultix 4.0andM;Network Performance.andP;  NCD seems to be focusing particularly on taking theload off the network and putting it on the terminal to speed up performance.andO;On the other hand, its nearest competitor, Visual Technology, is zeroing inon enhancing network performance.andP;  Visual, for instance, has rewritten TCP/IPto optimize it for the network performance of its X terminals.andP;  Its serversoftware also includes Network Services set up enhancements so that networkadministrators can configure the Visual machines to the network environment.andO;Another nice feature is Visual's memory failure protection.andP;  With it, Xterminals don't lock up when the client has run out of memory.andP;  Instead, theclient is notified that the terminal is out of memory and warned when memorystarts getting low.andM;Administration.andP;  Furthermore, X terminals generally offer a bigadministrative advantage.andP;  There is a huge difference between maintaining alarge number of workstations and a large number of X terminals.andP;  Terminalsrequire no application or operating system installation, no backup, no Unixoverhead, no software updates, no network management chores.andP;  They are alsomore secure than workstations (there's no &quot;root&quot; on an X terminal).andO;Performance is better because all the processing power is devoted to X Windowoperations.andP;  Moreover, X terminals are easily adaptable to multiple hosts andmultiple applications (at least, the third-party X terminals are; Digital andIBM X terminals must be hooked to Digital or IBM host counterparts--verydisconcerting).andM;Most importantly, X terminal technology has evolved quite a bit lately totake care of some of the problems outlined above.andM;COMMENTS.andP;  Other X terminal vendors besides Visual have adopted networkoptimization techniques to improve X performance.andP;  NCD is no exception.andP;  Iteven provides compression algorithms for serial connections.andP;  Frankly, NCD'snetwork optimization techniques coupled with its server developments give thecompany a considerable technical advantage in the X terminal marketplace.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
