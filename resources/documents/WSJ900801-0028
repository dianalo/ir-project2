The walkouts would follow the breakdown of contract talksbetween the United Steelworkers of America and officials ofStelco Inc. and Algoma Steel Corp., a subsidiary of DofascoInc.</LP><TEXT>   The expected shutdowns come with Canada's steel industryunder pressure from a slowing domestic economy and increasedpenetration of the Canadian market by U.S. steel producers.   Leo Gerard, director of District 6 of the UnitedSteelworkers, said, &quot;There's no way we can prevent a strike.&quot;He said the union, representing about 10,000 workers atToronto-based Stelco, has rejected what the company hascalled its final contract offer, which proposed wageincreases of about 2.5% in each year of a three-year pact.The union is seeking a bigger wage increase and betterprotection against inflation for workers and retirees.   At Algoma, where the union represents about 6,000,monetary issues haven't been broached, Mr. Gerard said. Talkswith the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, company broke down overlanguage concerning the contracting-out of work.   Both companies said an orderly shutdown of operations hasbeen under way for several days in anticipation of a strike.Fred Telmer, president of Stelco's steel division, also saidinventory stockpiles have been transferred to customers.</TEXT></DOC>
