(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tourism has increased so much at AbrahamLincoln's home since it reopened after a $2.2 million renovationthat some visitors have been turned away, and legislators areseeking money for more tour guides.   ``We've had a terrible situation where we've actually had to turnaway school kids who came to see the Lincoln home,'' said Rep.Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who represents the district where the homeis located.   Durbin and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., are hoping to funnel anadditional $67,000 to the home for more guides during the busyspring and summer months next year.   ``This is a national treasure and it ought to be preserved,''Simon said. ``We ought to make it as accessible to the public aspossible.''   The home, which was bought by Lincoln in 1844, was closed in May1987 for a $2.2 million restoration to ensure its stability. Theproject also included interior decorating and a new paint job in itshistorical hues. The home reopened in June.   Simon, who has written a book about Lincoln's days in theLegislature, said he was impressed by the job and could understandthe dramatic increase in the number of visitors.   The National Park Service, which runs the site, reported thatnearly 1,600 visitors were turned away between Sept. 4 and Oct. 8because the home was full.   From June through September, 419,000 people toured the home, an85 percent increase over the same period in 1986. The number ofvisitors for all of 1986 was 440,775.</TEXT></DOC>
