Gen. Omar HassanAhmed el-Bashir has decreed a one-month unilateral cease-fire in thewar with southern rebels.   The junta Tuesday night proposed a general amnesty for allSudanese who have taken up arms against the government since May1983, when the rebellion led by turncoat army Col. John Garang beganin three southern provinces.   The proposed amnesty in effect would cover the 50,000-60,000rebels of Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army.   The junta's actions stretched the cessation of hostilities in thesouthern regions of Upper Nile, Bahr el-Ghazal and Equatoria into athird month.   Both sides stilled their guns in May and June in response to aunilateral cease-fire proposed by Garang to allow the United Nationsto move 120,000 tons of relief supplies to the south to ward offfamine this summer.   The new unilateral cease-fire, which took effect Tuesday, and theproposed amnesty were announced in separate statements from theCommand Council of the National Salvation Revolution.   The 15-member council overthrew the civilian government of PrimeMinister Sadek el-Mahdi Friday in an apparently bloodless coup.   The council said el-Mahdi's failure to end the civil war wasamong principal reasons for the coup. It pledged to make peace inthe south its top priority, saying it would scrap all efforts begunby el-Mahdi and make a fresh start.   El-Bashir's subsequent actions appeared to bear this out. In aSaudi newspaper interview published Monday, said he had invitedrebel leader Garang to come to Khartoum for peace talks.   ``Inviting Garang to Khartoum is an initiative meant todemonstrate good intent,'' el-Bashir, 45, told the newspaper Okaz.   Tuesday night's announcement ordered ``a one-month truce in allwar zones and fighting scenes'' beginning immediately.   Despite el-Bashir's repeated peace vows, spokesmen for the SudanPeople's Liberation Army have refrained from comment, saying it wasclosely watching developments in Khartoum.   The armed forces' official newspaper reported today thatel-Bashir told the Ethiopian ambassador that he wanted to send adelegation to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, to meet with Garang'srepresentatives.   Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha said the rebel command replied Tuesday nightthat they were ready to talk with representatives of the junta. Thenewspaper said no date was set for the delegation to go.   The rebels have their political headquarters in Addis Ababa;Ethiopia has backed the rebels with money, arms and trainingfacilities since they began their armed insurrection demandinggreater autonomy and a better economic deal for southerners.   After lengthy hesitation, el-Mahdi's government, which tookoffice in 1986, opened peace talks with the rebels in Addis Ababa inMay. A new round was to have begun Tuesday, also in the Ethiopiancapital.   It junta said it expected the general amnesty would be enactedsoon. This should not take long because el-Bashir's council hasdissolved parliament.   Besides chairing the council, el-Bashir made himself premier,defense minister and military commander-in-chief. He has promised toform a Cabinet of civilians under the junta's tutelage.   The junta also announced Tuesday that 15 southern politicians whoworked for el-Mahdi's government were arrested on charges ofcorruption.   This brought to 45 the number of political figures the militarysaid they have arrested since the coup. The detainees includeleaders of political parties, which have since been disbanded, butnot el-Mahdi.   The Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram quoted el-Bashir as saying in aninterview that the prime minister, who led the Umma Party, remainsat large.   He said el-Mahdi had attended the wedding of a relative in aKhartoum suburb Thursday night and was not at home when troopsarrived after midnight to detain him.   El-Bashir also told Al-Ahram he used just 300 soldiers and 10tanks to seize power. He said the guard force at generalheadquarters and many other military units immediately pledgedloyalty to his movement and that most political party militias hadsurrendered to the army.</TEXT></DOC>
