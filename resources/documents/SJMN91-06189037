Or about the virtues ofself-reliance and traditional values?;    Could they dream of a better symbolof an elitist, out-of-touch Democratic Party than the sight of four whitemiddle-aged males, in various stages of comfort or affluence or wealth,arguing with the grandson of a sharecropper over fairness?;    It must seemlike the best of all possible worlds for conservatives: proof thatself-reliance can work, proof that &quot;diversity&quot; is alive and well in the BushWhite House.;    Is there any way for the liberals on the Senate JudiciaryCommittee to avoid this trap? Yes; provided they remember what worked duringthe 1987 fight over Judge Robert Bork.;    What killed it was the recognitionthat Bork read the Constitution so literally that he could not find a right ofprivacy in that document.;    Back in 1965, the Supreme Court struck down aConnecticut law that forbade the use of birth control even by married couples.The court said that, even though it was nowhere specifically enumerated in theConstitution, a right of privacy could be found in &quot;emanations&quot; and&quot;penumbras&quot; from the Bill of Rights.;    (It is that privacy right that becamethe basis for the court's 1973 ruling that abortion is a constitutionallyprotected right.);    Whatever the merits of the constitutional debate, mostAmericans heard Bork as saying that, as a Supreme Court justice, he would notstrike down a state law that banned the use of birth control.;    There issome evidence that Judge Thomas shares Bork's view about privacy. If theJudiciary Committee liberals want to oppose Clarence Thomas without steppinginto a political trap, they will sweep aside the debate over race and focustheir energy on privacy.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Jeff Greenfield column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910707  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  528  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 7, 199100189037,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
