Ask His Buddy Maynard   ----   By Marj Charlier   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/12/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1</SO><MS>CONSUMER CYCLICAL (CYC)</MS><IN>BIOGRAPHY (BIO)ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE (ENT)RECREATION, ENTERTAINMENT, TOYS, MOVIES, PHOTOGRAPHY (REC)</IN><RE>MINNESOTA (MN)NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   DULUTH, Minn. -- The winner has just crossed the finishline of the annual Beargrease Snowshoe Marathon here, and TomSobal is angry.   It isn't because he was late arriving and ended upstarting 10 minutes behind his 17 opponents; nor because someof the racers missed a loop in the snowy trail, cutting asmuch as two miles off their runs. It isn't because of theweather -- 18 below -- or because he slipped on ice andcracked a rib.</LP><TEXT>   No, what really frosts Mr. Sobal is that the race wasn'tlong enough.   This was his chance, you see, to break three hours in theyear's only snowshoe marathon. And while he finished at 2hours, 59 minutes, he felt from his pace that the course wasnot a legitimate 26.2 miles. Angry that his time is thus&quot;bogus,&quot; he throws his snowshoes in the back seat of afriend's car and threatens to quit the sport altogether. &quot;Ifanyone wants to buy these, get a name and phone number,&quot; hesays. Then he trudges off to thaw his beard and frost-nippedface in a hot tub.   Oh, by the way, Mr. Sobal won the race.   This skinny 34-year-old may be the best -- andhardest-working-athlete you have never heard of. He wins alot, but in esoteric winter events that rarely rise above theagate type in the sports pages. Last February, for example,he won the 100-mile Iditashoe snowshoe race in Alaska,cutting the course record by three hours, to under 24 hours.He holds the records for all three of Colorado's major burroraces -- marathon-length affairs in which man-burro twosomesscamper over rocky mountain passes. He also holds the recordfor the annual Doc Holliday 35-mile high-altitude run, aswell as dozens of other foot and snowshoe races in theWestern mountains.   But even with these credentials, Mr. Sobal is forced torun on the cheap. The only sponsor he could scare up for thebig snowshoe race was a running club in his hometown ofLeadville, Colo. It gave him $150 to help pay for a red-eyeflight to Minneapolis. From there he had to hitch a ride toDuluth. He has tried attracting snowshoe manufacturers andsmallish sports-accessories companies, but with little luck.&quot;Corporations want someone who is almost as big a brand nameas the product they're marketing,&quot; says Jim Andrews,editorial director of IEG Sponsorship Report, a publicationof International Events Group in Chicago. Snowshoers don'tfill the bill.   Besides, Mr. Sobal doesn't exactly exude the matinee-idolimage of a Carl Lewis or a Joe Montana. At 6-foot-3-inchesand 165 pounds, he is rail thin. A skinny 18-inch braidsnakes down the middle of his back, and his full beard turnsinto a hairy icicle in snowshoe races. He is also shy.   Mr. Sobal isn't complaining, mind you. He chooses hissports because they are local ones, not because they promiseendorsements. &quot;I think if you live in the mountains, youshould do mountain sports,&quot; he says.   Mr. Sobal actually began his running career on flat land,in Gary, Ind. After an embarrassing performance on thehighschool cross-country team, he and a friend decided to runevery day over the summer to improve. They did, securing topspots on the team the next fall. But the rebellious teen-agerbalked at the coach's orders and quit.   After college, he drifted into seasonal jobs, like cookingfor a Colorado dude ranch, while continuing to run. He soondiscovered he ran better at high altitudes than at sea leveland went searching for a mountain town where he could liveand train for more serious competition. One day in 1987, herode his mountain bike into two-mile-high Leadville(population 2,067), where the Climax Molybdenum mine had justshut down. Rent was cheap, the people friendly, and hestayed.   In the winter, Mr. Sobal runs six- to 13-mile snowshoeloops daily and swims three or four miles a week in the localpublic pool. In the summer, he runs at least 80 miles a week,about half of that with his racing partner Maynard, a burroowned by a Leadville dentist. Mr. Sobal bicycles to his15-hour-a-week jobs -- a local snowshoe factory in the winterand a bike shop in the summer. He says he trains so much hedoesn't have the time or energy for a full-time job.   All this makes Mr. Sobal a rare physical specimen. He hasa resting heart rate around 50, about the same as aworld-class athlete's, and he has suffered few injuries. Hesays he once ran a mile in four minutes and 18 seconds, andwhile that won't frighten any world-class milers, it's stillimpressive. It is even more impressive considering he did itat 8,000 feet and then, 10 minutes later, ran another mile infour minutes and 25 seconds.   r. Sobal thinks there are plenty of athletes who couldcompete with him in his sports if they wanted to. But notmany do. He organizes snowshoe races in Leadville, but theturnout is always disappointing. About 40 showed up for a20-mile race in January. (He won.) &quot;I asked my friends what Iwas doing wrong in organizing the thing,&quot; he says. &quot;They tellme the sport is just too hard.&quot;   So few are people with his kind of rarefied competitivefever that when Mr. Sobal found one, he married her. He andhis wife, Melissa Lee, met while competing in anultramarathon (a run of more than 26.2 miles). She is alsothe only woman ever to complete the 100-mile Iditashoe. Buteven the hardy Ms. Lee doesn't find it easy to live with aman who believes that every household should have only onedish per person (she's gotten him up to seven, total) and whokeeps the thermostat at a bone-chilling 45 degrees Fahrenheitin the winter. And &quot;that's a compromise,&quot; says theFlorida-born Ms. Lee. &quot;I can lie in bed at night and see mybreath.&quot;   But the sacrifices are worth it for all the prize money,right? Well . . . Over the past 18 years, Mr. Sobal says, themiles he has run have outnumbered the dollars he has earned.Competing in 15 events covering 326 miles last year -- andwinning 10 of them -- Mr. Sobal earned only a couple ofthousand dollars. For winning the Iditashoe, he and his wifeeach received three ounces of gold, worth about $1,000. Bythe time they paid expenses, they had $350 left. The victoryat Beargrease earned him a gift certificate to the GroundRound Restaurant; he gave it away because he is a vegetarian.He splits his burro-race winnings with the animal's owner.   Mr. Sobal and his wife live frugally, helped somewhat byMs. Lee's work as a massage therapist. They housesit inexchange for cheap rent. The only shoes Mr. Sobal owns arerunning shoes and snowshoes, and his clothes are layers ofinexpensive running knits.   But his goal isn't riches, it is &quot;improvement,&quot; he says.He still hopes to run a legitimate snowshoe marathon in lessthan three hours. Looking much further ahead, he and a friendhave a pact to run a marathon when they turn 100.   Why does he do it? &quot;Everyone has to have a passion inlife,&quot; he says. &quot;To some people their passion is their jobs.&quot;His is running.   And to Mr. Sobal, the meager returns are fine. He looksout his window each day at the mountain view and considershimself lucky, because, he says, &quot;I'm living my dream.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
