(Sandamp;MA).andP;  There are four reasons you should be involved:andM;1.andP;  Automating your sales and marketing functions yields substantial salesincreases and much happier customers.andM;2.andP;  Anyone causing big sales hikes and far happier customers is on track forinstant corporate stardom.andM;3.andP;  Sandamp;MA involves heavy use of telecommunications and telecom networking.andM;4.andP;  There's no one in your company who knows anything about Sandamp;MA.andP;  Whateverlittle you know will make you look brilliant.andM;The &quot;classic&quot; Sandamp;MA involves putting a software-loaded laptop PC (personalcomputer) into the hands of your salesforce.andP;  At minimum that &quot;software&quot;includes customers/prospect contact programs and an asynchronoustelecommunications/electronic mail program for talking to headquarters.andM;At the maximum extreme, software could be totally customized and includecomplete order entry, order status management, expense tracking andreimbursement.andM;Salespeople armed with laptop PCs, some sales automation software and somerudimentary communications routinely show 10% to 30% sales gains.andM;There are three main reasons sales forces are &quot;automated&quot;.andM;1.andP;  The opportunity to sell more.andP;  More information and more accurateinformation in the salespersons' hands simply means being able to close moresales faster.andP;  Knowing what's in stock and what isn't -- without having tomake another voice phone call -- is a major plus ovr the mess that goes ontoday.andM;2.andP;  Sellers' efficiency improvement.andP;  Handling paperwork on a computer is abig plus.andP;  Computers turn out &quot;personalized&quot; letters better and faster thanpeople.andM;One telecom seller I know carries a laptop with specific and general RFPs.andO;He prepares the specific RFP at home.andP;  If the prospect wants a change in thecontract, he makes it there and then (seller and buyer crowd around thelaptop screen).andP;  The seller prints out a new contract there and then.andP;  Thebuyer signs it.andP;  The time savings are enormous.andM;3.andP;  Cost displacement.andP;  Greater accuracy.andP;  If a seller can do order entry onhis own PC rather than read the numbers to an illiterate, ignorant clerk atheadquarters, you no longer need the clerk.andP;  The orders are more accuratewhen your seller enters them.andP;  The seller has a stake in the accuracy, speedand hassle-free customer business; he's the one who gets called to correctthe screwups.andM;There are basically two types of sales automation software.andP;  The first is&quot;off-the-shelf,&quot; and usually self-contained within the salesperson's PC.andP;  Ittypically adds $500 to $1,000 to the price of a PC.andP;  A decent laptop -- theToshiba 1200 HB, for example, costs $2500.andP;  A Grid will cost a little more.andM;The second is customized.andP;  Typically, it's integrated with the home officemainframe.andP;  The seller's PC thus becomes an extension of the mainframe.andO;replete with all its databases and power.andP;  This adds $4,000 to $6,000 to thecost of a laptop.andP;  How much depends on how many laptops (or sellers) you canspread the fixed programming cost over.andP;  Typically, this option is only forFortune 1000 salesforces.andM;TELECONNECT is now on our second generation of sales productivity software.andO;We're using Paradox 2.0.andP;  We're about to move onto our third generation,which will probably be a combination of Paradox 3.0, Maximizer and ReferenceFile.andP;  Like most smaller companies, we stay with commercially availablestuff.andM;Years ago we tried to write our own.andP;  It took six months, far too long.andP;  Theday we finally got it debugged (I was chief debugger), it was out of date!andO;But the results were stugerring.andP;  They easily confirmed the 10% to 30% salesincreases you can expect.andM;Think of good sales productivity software as automated 6&quot; x4&quot; cards puttogethr like a company organization chart.andP;  At the top you have one card forthe company -- all about it, what it does, where it is and what its historyof dealing with your company has been.andM;Underneath it and attached by a single company reference number (the&quot;relation&quot; part of the database) are additional 6&quot; x4&quot; cards, each of whichdetail the &quot;contact&quot; at the company you're dealing with.andP;  You may haveseveral contacts.andP;  So you'll have several cards.andM;Each card has obvious stuff like address, phone number, secretary's name,salutation (how to address your &quot;personalized&quot; letters) and date of nextcontact.andM;Associated with each &quot;contact&quot; care are an unlimited number of &quot;note&quot; cards.andO;These are places to write notes on conversations.andP;  As you finish eachconversation, they're organized automatically in date order.andM;The programs have lots of other features too numerous for this small article.andO;Among my favorites:andM;* Hotlist making.andP;  Tell the program to go through and grab all the today's&quot;Contacts.&quot;andP;  It will make a separate list of those contacts.andM;* Automatic dialing.andP;  Put a modem in your PC, the program will dial today's&quot;hotlist&quot; and throw you directly into your notes.andM;* Automatic letter writing.andP;  Pick a list -- all of your prospects who makewidgets -- send them a &quot;special&quot; sale price on ingredients to make widgetswith.andM;* Personal record keeping.andP;  Here's a calendar of all your appointments.andP;  Alisting of all your expenses, broken down by the various categories ourbookkeeper insists on.andM;The best of all is that you're dealing with computers, not paper.andP;  This meansyour stuff is (a) organized; (b) clean; and (c) you can take up as much spaceas you want.andM;You must use a hard disk.andP;  That's trivial these days.andP;  A hard disk capable ofholding the equivalent of 12,500 pages costs less than $300.andM;That's  a super-fast overview of sales force automation.andP;  For more on salesforce automation, see the sources I've listed along with this article.andP;  Nowto &quot;marketing automation.&quot;andM;Put yourself in your prospects'/customers' shoes.andP;  Start as a prospect.andP;  Movethrough to being a customer.andP;  Then think:andM;1.andP;  Direct mail, advertising and literature fulfillment.andP;  Everything frompicking and tracking lists to sending out literature before they forget whythey asked for it.andM;2.andP;  Outbound Calling to Prospects and Customers.andP;  No one said every customerneeded a personal visit.andP;  No one said every customer needed a dedicatedexpensive salesperson.andP;  But every customer does need attention and loving.andM;3.andP;  Inbound Calling From Customers.andP;  They need to place orders.andP;  They need tofind out how their new gadgets from your company work.andP;  They need to find outtechie stuff so theycan re-sell your stuff to someone else.andM;4.andP;  Outbound and Inbound Calling from Your Salespeople.andP;  They need quickanswers to questions -- often when they're standing in front of theircustomers.andP;  Sometimes the order depends on it.andP;  Sometimes they don't need tospeak to a human, just a database.andP;  They want information.andP;  How they get itis irrelevant (to them).andP;  So long as they make the sale.andM;Now think of the full breadth of available telecom tools which can be focusedon solving these proglems.andP;  We have automatic call distributors --standalone, and contained within PBXs and hybrids.andP;  We have combinationautomated attendants/voice mail machines.andP;  they're great for gettinginformation back and forth to sellers and distributos (i.e.andP;  customers).andM;And we have networks for getting electronic mail and facsimile messages inand out of desktop and laptop computers.andP;  These networks are increasinglygoing with System Signaling #7, which can tell us who's calling before thephone rings, talk to our database and bring up on screen all the informationabout the person before we answer.andP;  &quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Smith, how mayTELECONNECT Magazine help you?&quot;andM;That's it.andP;  Sandamp;MA (Sales and Marketing Automation) is the greatest careeropportunity ever.andP;  Want more?andP;
