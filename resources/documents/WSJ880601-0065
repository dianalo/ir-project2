Eventually the state rebated some $1.1 billion to taxpayers.    Today, California is staring at an annual revenue shortfall of $1 billion for this year and a similar amount next year. Shocked state officials are now trying to figure out ways to cut spending and raise revenue. The turnaround, says state finance director Jesse Huff is &quot;mind boggling.&quot;    The nation's most populous state isn't alone in its predicament. After a big surplus last year, New York faces a $900 million shortfall in its current budget. Massachusetts is looking at about $200 million less than expected for its coming fiscal year. Other states are faced with similar problems. Budget analysts fear that some of the short-term solutions being contemplated by the states may bring on even deeper fiscal gloom in years to come.    State officials believe many of their headaches stem from the 1986 federal tax reform act. To beat the federal increase in the tax rate on capital gains, which took effect in 1987, many people sold stock or property in 1986.    That surge in selling was the main reason behind the big bulge in state revenue at tax time last year. &quot;The question then was how much of that increase was borrowed from revenues in future years&quot; and when the impact would be felt, says John Vickerman, chief deputy legislative analyst for the California Legislature.    The answer seems to be a lot more, and much sooner than expected. In Massachusetts, for instance, the state took in $600 million in taxes from capital gains for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1987. It expects to take in only $300 million this fiscal year. &quot;We've gone on a real roller-coaster ride,&quot; says Frank Keefe, the state's secretary for finance and administration. Though the state expected a drop, &quot;our low expectations weren't low enough,&quot; he adds.    In California, a year-to-year drop in capital gains tax revenue was compounded by legislation to make the state tax codes conform with the 1986 federal overhaul. One effect was to make the state more dependent on capital gains tax revenue. The legislation also appears to have reduced taxes for more individuals than anticipated, says Mr. Huff, the state finance director.    As a result, revenue from personal income taxes is up only 0.3% so far this fiscal year, ending June 30, despite a strong state economy. That's far below the 8% to 10% annual growth the state has seen in recent years and even below the growth levels of recession years.    California officials caution they probably won't have a complete understanding of the revenue shortfall until early next year when the state finishes analyzing sample 1987 tax returns.    However, California officials can't wait. Gov. George Deukmejian has proposed a package of spending cuts and tax increases aimed at balancing the $44.5 billion budget he submitted to the Legislature for the year beginning July 1. The budget for the current fiscal year is about $41 billion.    The proposed moves include suspending for a year a mechanism that adjusts tax brackets upward to keep individuals from being pushed into higher brackets because of inflation. This would raise an estimated $400 million.    The governor also is backing legislation that would bring state corporate tax law into conformity with changes Congress made last year. That move is projected to raise $250 million annually. Gov. Deukmejian also wants to suspend for a year some corporate tax breaks regarding treatment of prior-year losses.    The governor is also proposing a 1% spending cut in state programs and reducing the state's budget reserve to $600 million from $1.1 billion. Another $500 million in revenue is penciled to come from a stronger-than-expected state economy.    New York state is looking at a combination of spending cuts and dipping into reserves, although nothing specific has yet been decided, says Dall W. Forsythe, the state budget director. He says it appears that longer-term assumptions about capital-gains tax revenue have been too optimistic. &quot;So we probably will have a somewhat smaller revenue base and will need some permanent spending cuts,&quot; he says.    The idea of tapping budget reserves disturbs some observers. If there is recession soon, states will need larger and not smaller financial cushions, says Steven Gold, director of fiscal studies at the national conference of state legislatures. By cutting reserves, he warns, &quot;we are setting ourselves up for big troubles down the road.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
