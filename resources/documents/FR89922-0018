Introduction</ITAG>On August 20, 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Price-AndersonAmendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-408) (PAAA). The PAAA subjectsDOE contractors who enter into indemnification agreements under the Price-AndersonAct, and their subcontractors and suppliers, to civil and criminal penaltiesfor violations of applicable DOE rules, regulations or orders related tonuclear safety. Today, DOE invites the public to comment on its plans toimplement this new civil and criminal penalty authority as part of an integratedDOE enforcement program that provides enforcement actions commensuratewith the significance of the involved safety issues.The notice invites comments to aid the Department in formulating a generalstatement of enforcement policy designed to make clear to the contractors,subcontractors and suppliers the manner in which DOE will exercise itsenforcement discretion. DOE has reviewed the enforcement policies of otheragencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, the Research and Special Programs Administration andthe Federal Aviation Administration within the Department of Transportation,and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration within the Departmentof Labor, as well as recommendations of the Administrative Conference ofthe United States. The results of this review will be considered in developingthe DOE enforcement policy. DOE also will consider public comments receivedin response to this notice. DOE plans to initiate rulemaking on two issues raised by the PAAA civiland criminal penalty provisions. The PAAA exempts certain persons, includingsome educational institutions, from the civil penalty provisions and authorizesDOE to determine by rule whether other nonprofit educational institutionsshould receive automatic remission of civil penalties. Development of proceduresto be utilized when a nuclear-safety violation has been alleged also willbe accomplished by rulemaking. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on thesetwo issues will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the future.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>A. DOE Management and Operating Contracts DOE and its predecessor agencies, the Manhattan Engineer District, theAtomic Energy Commission (AEC), and Energy Research and Development Administration(ERDA), have utilized the services of private industry and universitiesto operate their major nuclear facilities since the early 1940s. The Governmentdecided that it was necessary to enlist the scientists, engineers and techniciansavailable outside the Government to develop and produce nuclear weapons,but that it was impracticable to hire these experts directly.Therefore, AEC, ERDA and DOE generally have entered into 5-year contractswith universities, such as the University of California, and private corporations,such as Westinghouse Electric Corporation, to fulfill continuing research,development, and production needs. These contractors are paid all allowablecosts, as enumerated in the contracts, and bear little financial risk forcarrying out the Government's nuclear programs since the allowable costsprovisions are extensive and the Price-Anderson Act indemnity clause isbroad. See 48 CFR 970.5204-13 and 952.250-70.Although the assets of management and operating contractors historicallyhave been at little risk, the award fee system, applicable to most corporatemanagement and operating contractors, allows for lower fees for poor contractperformance. Still, the existing assets of these contractors would notbe affected significantly by reduced fees. Now, with the passage of PAAApenalty provisions, DOE management and operating contractors engaged innuclear activities, as well as other DOE nuclear contractors and theirsubcontractors and suppliers, are subject to more significant financialrisk for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety requirements. DOEintends to amend its Acquisition Regulations to state that Price-Andersonpenalties are not allowable costs under any circumstances.B. The Price-Anderson ActIn 1957, Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act by enacting the Price-AndersonAct (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 2210 and parts of 2014, to establish a systemof financial protection for persons who may be injured by a nuclear incident.The Act authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to indemnifyits licensees operating nuclear power plants and DOE to indemnify its contractorsengaged in nuclear activities for public liability arising from a nuclearincident. The new Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (PAAA) was signedinto law on August 20, 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-408). The PAAA renews NRCand DOE authority to indemnify under the Act until August 1, 2002, andamends the Act in many respects.Two major changes to the Act are relevant here. First, the PAAA makes mandatoryDOE's previously discretionary authority to provide Price-Anderson indemnitycoverage and extends that coverage to any person who may conduct activitiesunder a DOE contract that involve the risk of public liability for a nuclearincident and who is not covered by the NRC-administered Price-Andersonsystem. This new statutory requirement significantly broadens the classof DOE contractors who will receive Price-Anderson coverage, since underthe prior law only persons under the risk of public liability for a substantialnuclear incident could obtain the indemnity. In the near future, DOE willbe proposing amendments to its Acquisition Regulations, codified in 48CFR chapter 9, addressing the question of which DOE contractors, subcontractorsand suppliers will be covered by the DOE administerd Price-Anderson system.Second, the PAAA makes most DOE contractors covered by the DOE Price-Andersonsystem, and their subcontractors and suppliers, subject to civil and criminalpenalties for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety requirements.These penalty provisions are the subject of this notice. This notice refers to DOE contractors covered by Price-Anderson and thussubject to penalty provisions as ``DOE nuclear contractors'' for ease ofreference. C. Legislative History of Civil and Criminal Penalty Provisions When the original Price-Anderson Act was being considered in 1957, theAEC suggested that the term ``public liability,'' which defines coverageunder the Act (42 U.S.C. 2014(w)), exclude ``willful damages,'' apparentlyto prevent indemnifying a contractor who caused damages through willfulmisconduct. This approach was rejected by the Joint Committee on AtomicEnergy in 1957:<ITAG tagnum="21">The suggestion which was contained in the original draft legislationof the Commission that willful damages be excluded was not accepted sincethe damage to the public is the same, whether caused by any means ``willfulor nonwillful.'' S. Rep. No. 296, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1957U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News. 1819.</ITAG>Therefore, the indemnity provided in the Price-Anderson indemnity clausehas not contained any exception based on the conduct of the contractor.In fact, these clauses state:<ITAG tagnum="21">The obligations of DOE under this clause shall not be affected byany failure on the part of the contractor to fulfill its obligation underthis contract *** 48 CFR 952.250-70(h). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions of this clause shall not be limited in any way by,and shall be interpreted without reference to, any other clause of thiscontract ***.'' 48 CFR 952.250-70(j).</ITAG>During the 1983 to 1988 congressional consideration of legislation to renewPrice-Anderson indemnity authority, the soundness of this approach wasquestioned. Several members of Congress expressed the view that fully indemnifyinga contractor from liability for damages caused by that contractor's negligencewas a disincentive to safe operations. In response to such views, the civil and criminal penalty provisions ofthe PAAA were enacted, which do not affect indemnity directly, but placeindemnified contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers under therisk of penalties for violation for applicable DOE nuclear-safety rules,regulations, and orders. The Senate Report explains:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee included this authority in legislation extending thePrice-Anderson Act to provide for greater accountability of contractors,subcontractors and suppliers in the performance of their duties under contractwith the Department of Energy for nuclear activities indemnified underthe Price-Anderson Act. The Committee believes that the availability andcareful exercise of this authority by the Department can reduce the likelihoodof serious nuclear incidents in connection with DOE facilities and activitiesby providing greater reason for care in existing operations and strongincentives to identify capital improvements in existing facilities andmodifications in practices that can improve health, safety and environmentalmanagement. S. Rep. No. 166, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">D. Civil and Criminal Penalty Provisions </ITAG>A summary of the major provisions follows below: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Civil Penalties </ITAG>andbullet; The PAAA authorizes the Secretary of Energy to assess civil penaltiesagainst DOE nuclear contractors and their subcontractors and suppliersfor violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety rules, regulations andorders, including those expressly incorporated by reference by DOE, exceptthose issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT). The penalty maynot exceed $100,000 per day per violation. If a violation is a continuingone, each day of the violation constitutes a separate violation. andbullet; The PAAA exempts from such penalties DOE's existing contractors,and their subcontractors and suppliers, at the following laboratories foractivities associated with operating these laboratories: Argonne NationalLaboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories,FERMI National Laboratory, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, BrookhavenNational Laboratory, and Pacific Northwest Laboratory. andbullet; The PAAA requires that the Secretary determine by rule whethernonprofit educational institutions not otherwise exempt from penaltiesunder the PAAA should receive automatic remission of civil penalties. Theinitiation of that rulemaking will be noticed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the future. andbullet; The PAAA gives the Secretary discretion in implementation of thecivil penalty authority. In determining the amount of a penalty, the Secretaryis authorized to take into account the nature, circumstances, extent andgravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, ability topay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of priorsuch violations, the degree of culpability, and such other matters as theSecretary deems just. andbullet; A civil penalty may be issued only by order, and before issuingthe order, the alleged violator must be provided notice and afforded theopportunity to elect, in writing, within 30 days either adjudication beforean administrative law judge or prompt assessment of the penalty, with 60days to pay, before DOE initiates any action in federal district court.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Criminal Penalties </ITAG>andbullet; The PAAA also subjects all DOE nuclear contractors, subcontractorsand suppliers (with no exemptions) to criminal sanctions (up to $25,000in fines and 2 years imprisonment for a first conviction, and $50,000 infines and 5 years imprisonment for subsequent convictions) for knowingand willful violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety rules, regulationsor orders, including those expressly incorporated by reference by DOE,except those issued by the DOT, when such violations result in or, if undetected,would have resulted in a nuclear incident. andbullet; Suspected criminal violations must be referred to the Departmentof Justice for appropriate action. 42 U.S.C. 2271. Therefore, DOE's enforcementpolicy will apply only to civil penalties. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. DOE Safety Requirements </ITAG>The PAAA authorizes DOE to assess civil penalties for violations of applicablerules, regulations, and orders related to nuclear safety. Generally, thesafety requirements for the Department's nuclear operations are specifiedin DOE Orders. These Orders provide minimum requirements to be followedin the operation of the Department's reactors and nuclear facilities. TheOperations Offices in the field provide DOE Order Supplements to the contractor,which reflect DOE Order requirements and provide more detailed requirementsrelated to the specific operations at particular sites. Contractors alsoare subject to facility and site specific safety requirements imposed throughcontract conditions, such as technical specifications or operational safetyrequirements. Requirements applicable to naval nuclear propulsion, whereDOE performs the research and development functions and oversees nuclearsafety matters pertaining to the shipboard and prototype propulsion plantsused for U.S. Naval nuclear powered warships are contained in classifieddocuments because of their military nature. The cognizant congressional committees were aware that DOE's nuclear-safetyrequirements generally are compiled in DOE Orders and as contract conditions.These committees did not include in the new legislation any requirementto establish new safety provisions or to subject the existing ones to review.Rather, the Senate Report states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee expects the Secretary of Energy to publish and makeavailable to DOE contractors, subcontractors and suppliers the rules, regulationsand orders (including identification of those rules, regulations and ordersincorporated by reference) applicable to the activities in which thosecontractors, subcontractors and suppliers are engaged, the violation ofwhich may subject these persons to the penalties authorized by this amendment[civil penalties] and by amendment 15 [criminal penalties], discussed below.''S. Rep. No. 166, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 22-23 (1987).</ITAG>Therefore, DOE intends to publish, and make available to DOE nuclear contractors,subcontractors, and suppliers, a list of DOE Orders and other current requirementsrelated to nuclear safety the violation of which may result in a penalty.Although classified and sensitive unclassified requirements will not bepublished, they will nonetheless be made known to the contractor. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. General Statement of Enforcement Policy </ITAG>DOE intends to issue a general statement of enforcement policy designedto make clear to DOE nuclear contractors, subcontractors, and suppliersthe manner in which DOE will exercise its enforcement discretion. The initialrecommendation for imposition of a penalty will be made by persons conversantwith the technical details of the contractor's work, contractual responsibilities,history of performance, and applicable nuclear safety-related requirements.DOE invites public comments on the objectives and the content of its enforcementpolicy, as discussed in A, B, and C below. A. Enforcement Objectives DOE views the purpose of implementing the enforcement provisions of thePAAA on DOE nuclear contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers to be thepromotion and protection of the safety of the public and employees fromundue risks stemming from the violation of applicable nuclear-safety requirements.A DOE enforcement program will satisfy this purpose if the following objectivesare met: (1) Compliance with applicable DOE rules, regulations, orders, and technicalspecifications (or operational safety requirements) related to the nuclearsafety of facilty operations by DOE contractors. (2) Accountability of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in performanceof their duties under contract with DOE for nuclear activities indemnifiedunder the PAAA. (3) Positive incentives for a contractor's timely: (a) Self-detection ofproblems; (b) Reporting to DOE; (c) Analysis of root causes of problems;(d) Correction of problems on a permanment basis that precludes recurrence.(4) Deterrence of future violations of DOE requirements by a contractor.(5) Encouragement, by example, of the improvement of DOE nuclear contractors'operation of DOE facilities. The success of the DOE program to implement the enforcement provisionsof the PAAA depends on the degree to which the above objectives are met,and the manner in which the overall enforcement authority is exercised.DOE believes the following are key factors in exercising this authority:(1) Prompt, vigorous, and consistent enforcement action. (2) Appropriate balancing of penalty with risk, ensuring the penalty iscommensurate with the seriousness of the violation and past performanceof the contractor. (3) Well defined safety requirements. B. Enforcement Policy Alternatives The PAAA requires that in determining the amount of any civil penalty,DOE shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravityof the violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay, effecton ability to continue to do business, any history of prior violations,the degree of culpability, and such other matters as justice may require.In addition, in determining the amount of any civil penalty, DOE intendsto consider self-detection, timely reporting and self-correction by thecontractor. DOE intends, as part of the development of its enforcementprogram, to establish a policy addressing these factors. Public commentsare solicited on the following alternatives: (1) Adapting the NRC enforcement policy (10 CFR part 2, appendix C) toDOE requirements. Preliminary review of the NRC enforcement policy indicatesthat this may be the preferred option. The NRC uses a risk-based enforcement program that has evolved over manyyears of application. Although many DOE nuclear activities differ significantlyfrom NRC-licensed activities, the nuclear safety requirements and the legislativeauthority (including penalty limits of $100,000 a day per violation) aresimilar for both agencies. The purpose of the NRC program is to promotethe public health and safety by: (a) Ensuring compliance with regulationsand licenses; (b) obtaining prompt correction of violations: (c) deterringfuture violations; and (d) encouraging overall improvement of the performanceof licensees and the industry. These goals are analogous to DOE's goals,except that we would apply our program to contractors rather than licenseesand seek compliance with safety requirements and contracts rather thanregulations and licenses. The primary criterion used by NRC for assessing penalties is the gravityof the violation. Secondary criteria are: (a) Prompt identification andreporting to NRC; (b) timely corrective actions; (c) past performance andoccurrence of similar events, (d) multiple occurrences of the same violation;and (e) ability to pay. NRC applies these criteria in establishing whichof five severity levels will be used to determine the amount of civil penaltyto be assessed. NRC defines these levels as follows: Levels I and II_actualor high potential public risk or of very significant regulatory concern;Level III_significant concern; Level IV_less serious, but more than minorconcern, and if uncorrected could lead to more serious concern; Level V_minorsafety or environmental concern. Generally, civil penalties are assessedonly for Levels I, II, and III, but discretion is exercised on a case-by-casebasis. The NRC enforcement policy was recently amended to provide greater incentivesfor the licensee to identify and correct violations by decreasing or eliminatingcivil penalties when a licensee identifies the violation and promptly reportsthe violation to the NRC, and increasing penalties where a licensee failsto identify, prevent and correct violations. 53 FR 40019, October 13, 1988.(2) Adopting a simplified multi-level penalty system. For example, assesspenalties as follows: least severe violation (no civil penalty), intermediateseverity level violation ($50,000/violation/day), and most severe violation($100,000/violation/day). (3) Using penalties that relate directly to the cost to the governmentof nuclear-safety violations where the contractor clearly can be held responsible.In these cases, the contractor could be required to take corrective actionsat its own expense for deficiencies identified as the root cause of theproblem. C. Relationship Between Penalty Assessment and Other DOE Enforcement ToolsPublic comments are solicited on the appropriate means of achieving anintegrated enforcement program that utilizes all enforcement tools availableto DOE. For example, many DOE nuclear contracts provide for lower feesfor poor performance or safety violations. Should these arrangements bemodified to reflect the possible imposition of civil and criminal penalties?Should there be a specific relationship established between fee reductionsand penalty assessments? <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Nonprofit Educational Institutions </ITAG>The PAAA requires that DOE determine by rule whether nonprofit educationalinstitutions, other than those exempted by statute, should receive automaticremission of any civil penalty under the PAAA. the initiation of that rulemakingwill be noticed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the future. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Enforcement Procedures </ITAG>The PAAA is explicit about what basic procedures are to be followed inthe event DOE assesses a civil penalty. DOE must assess the penalty byorder, and before issuing the order, the alleged violator must be providednotice of the proposed penalty and the opportunity to elect in writingwithin 30 days either of the following procedures (if an election is notmade, the first procedure will be implemented): (1) A determination of violation made on the record after an opportunityfor an agency hearing, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554, before an administrativelaw judge. Judicial review of the order could be sought by the violatorwithin 60 calendar days through an action in the appropriate U.S. Courtof Appeals; or (2) Prompt assessment of the penalty giving the alleged violator 60 daysto pay the penalty before DOE initiates an action in the appropriate U.S.District Court for an order affirming the assessment. The District Courthas authority to conduct a <T3>de novo</T3> review of the law and facts involved, and can enforce,modify or set aside the assessment. The PAAA also provides DOE with the power to compromise, modify, or remitcivil penalties with or without conditions. The Administrative Conferenceof the United States has stated that agencies possessing civil penaltyauthority have found it efficient to try to resolve cases before the formalhearing stage, through settlement and negotiation, and has recommendedthat agencies provide an alleged violator a right to reply in writing and/oran informal oral conference if necessary. 1 CFR 305.79-3. DOE anticipatesthat it will establish a policy for resolving cases prior to the initiationof formal procedures required by the PAAA.  DOE intends to propose procedural rules to advise persons of the processto be utilized when a nuclear-safety violation has been alleged. The initiationof that rulemaking will be noticed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the near future.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, September 15, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric J.
