These conditions, commonly referred to as the ``tandem operationsrestrictions,'' provide that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the thrift institutions would be operated as separate, independent,profit-oriented corporate entities and would not be operated in tandemwith any other subsidiary of the bank holding company. In order to carryout this condition, the bank holding company and thrift institutions wouldlimit their operations so that: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) no banking or other subsidiary of the bank holding company wouldlink its deposit-taking activities to accounts at the thrift institutionsin a sweeping arrangement or similar arrangement; and,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) the thrift institutions would not directly or indirectly solicitdeposits or loans for any other subsidiary of the bank holding companyand the bank holding company and its subsidiaries would not solicit depositsor loans for the thrift institutions; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) to the extent necessary to insure independent operation of thethrift institution and prevent the improper diversion of funds, the thriftinstitutions would not engage in any transactions with the bank holdingcompany or its other subsidiaries without prior approval of the appropriateFederal Reserve Bank.</ITAG>Citicorp contends that these conditions prohibit normal and lawful businessbehavior, impose unnecessary costs and burdensome inefficiencies, limitservices to consumers, and frustrate efforts to restore failed or failingthrift institutions to financial viability. Citicorp also argues that thetandem operations restrictions have worked as a significant deterrent tothrift acquisitions by bank holding companies, at a time when bank holdingcompanies could help to fulfill the thrift industry's critical need foroutside financial and managerial resources. In addition, Citicorp pointsto the provisions of the proposed Financial Institutions Reform, Recoveryand Enforcement Act of 1989, which would authorize bank holding companiesto acquire thrift institutions without restrictions on transactions betweenthe thrift and its holding company affiliates except as required undersections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or as otherwise requiredby law.The Board believes that, in considering action in this area, it is appropriateto seek public comment, in light of the significant public participationthat surrounded the original development of the conditions. Accordingly,the Board seeks public comment on whether the restrictions should be retained,modified or removed.Comments regarding this notice, which would refer to Docket No. R-0663,must be received at the offices of the Board of Governors no later thanMay 19, 1989. All comments should be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551,or delivered to the courtyard entrance, Eccles Building, 20th Street NW.,between ``C'' Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC, between8:45 a.m, and 5:15 p.m. weekdays.
