Executive Summary</ITAG>On June 10, 1988, the Commission published for comment Regulation S,\1\<NOTE/> which was intended to clarify the extraterritorial applicationof the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``SecuritiesAct'').\2\<NOTE/> The Regulation contained both a general statement (the ``GeneralStatement''), providing that the registration requirements do not applyto offers and sales that occur outside the United States, and two non-exclusivesafe harbors from those requirements for specified offers and sales. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Securities Act Release No. 6779 (June 10, 1988) [53 FR22661] (the ``Proposing Release'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq</T3>. After reviewing the comments received,\3\<NOTE/> which supported the Regulation's rationale but suggestedchanges to increase the utility of the Regulation, the Commission todayis publishing a revised Regulation S for comment. The General Statementremains unchanged, and the proposed Regulation continues to include twosafe harbors: one for issuers, securities professionals involved in thedistribution process and their affiliates (the ``issuer safe harbor'')and the other for resales by all other persons (the ``resale safe harbor'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Ninety-five comment letters on the Proposing Release werereceived. Those letters and a summary of the comments are available forpublic inspection and copying in File No. S7-9-88 at the Commission's PublicReference Room in Washington, DC. As in the original proposal, the safe harbors would impose two generalconditions. First, any offer or sale of securities must be made in an ``offshoretransaction.'' As reproposed, that definition would be broadened to coversales on designated organized foreign securities markets. Second, ``directedselling efforts'' could not be made in the United States. The definitionof ``directed selling efforts'' has been modified to emphasize that theprohibition relates only to activities that are intended, or that couldreasonably be expected, to result in general preconditioning of the U.S.market. Several significant changes have been made to the terms and conditionsthat must be satisfied under the safe harbors to assure that U.S. registrationrequirements do not apply. While the issuer safe harbor still would distinguishamong three categories of issuers, the first category, which imposes norestrictions other than the two general conditions, would be broadenedto include offerings by an expanded group of foreign issuers. As revised,the first category would extend to offerings by foreign issuers targetedat their home country markets and offerings by foreign issuers with nosubstantial U.S. market interest, whether or not the issuer had a continuousreporting obligation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``ExchangeAct'').\4\<NOTE/> In addition, the scope of the term ``substantial U.S. marketinterest'' in an issuer's securities would be narrowed to cover only equitysecurities for which the United States was a significant market and debtsecurities held in large amounts by a significant number of U.S. persons.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78a <T3> et seq</T3>.The second issuer safe harbor category, which originally was applicableto all reporting issuers in the proposed Regulation, has been extendedin the reproposal to apply to offerings of debt securities of foreign issuerswhere there was a substantial U.S. market interest in the issuer's debtsecurities. The restricted period applicable to this safe harbor, duringwhich offers and sales in the United States and to U.S. persons would beprohibited, has been shortened from 90 to 40 days. In addition, the Regulationas revised would no longer proscribe the deposit of securities in exchangefor American depositary receipts (``ADRs'') during a restricted period,but rather would focus on whether ADRs being sold to U.S. residents weretraceable to the securities being offered and sold offshore. The third issuer safe harbor category would be available to all issuersbut would be of use primarily for offerings of non-reporting U.S. issuersand equity offerings of non-reporting foreign issuers with substantialU.S. market interest for the class of securities offered that would notqualify for the other two issuer safe harbor categories. This categorywould impose more restrictive procedures designed to guard against flowbackof securities to the United States. As with the second category, the restrictedperiod for debt securities has been reduced to 40 days. The resale safe harbor also has been modified to distinguish between dealersand persons receiving selling concession, fees or other remuneration, andall other persons. As revised, the resale safe harbor would impose restrictionson resale beyond the general conditions only where the securities weresold by a dealer or other person receiving a selling concession, fee orother remuneration. Any security could be resold on an established foreignsecurities exchange or designated organized foreign securities market,if a selling dealer (or person receiving a selling commission, fee or otherremuneration) or person acting on his behalf did not know that the buyerwas a U.S. person. The definition of ``U.S. person'' has been modified due to reconsiderationof the Commission's decision to reverse the <T3>Baer Securities </T3>no-action letter.\5\<NOTE/> The revised proposed definition of U.S. person would notinclude any discretionary custodial account or similar account held bya dealer or other professional fiduciary located in the United States ifthe beneficial owner was not a U.S. person. Any offer or sale to such personin reliance on the Regulation, however, would still be required to be madeoutside the United States to fall within the safe harbors of RegulationS. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Bear Securities Corporation </T3>(Oct. 12, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Revised Proposed Regulation S </ITAG>A. General Statement The General Statement,\6\<NOTE/> which remains unchanged from the version initially proposed,would include a list of the considerations to be used in determining whetheran offer or sale occurs outside the United States.\7\<NOTE/> While various commenters criticized different aspects ofthe specified considerations, no clear consensus on any particular pointwas reflected. Because the list of factors was included in the originalRegulation to provide assistance to persons relying on the General Statementto demonstrate an offer or sale was an offshore transaction, it has beenretained in the revised Regulation. The Commission requests comment asto whether the entire list of relevent considerations should be deletedfrom the General Statement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Proposed Rule 901.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Proposed Rule 901(b).B. General Conditions Under both the proposed Regulation and the revised version proposed today,two general conditions would apply to all offers and sales made in relianceon the Regulation.\8\<NOTE/> Those conditions are a prohibition against ``directed sellingefforts'' in the United States\9\<NOTE/> and a requirement that the offer and sale of the securitiesbe made in an ``offshore transaction.''\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rule 904. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Proposed Rule 904(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Proposed Rule 904(a). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``Directed Selling Efforts''</ITAG>The prohibition against directed selling efforts in the United States havebeen modified in the revised proposed Regulation. The language of the definition\11\<NOTE/> has been revised to conform to the explanation in the ProposingRelease and preclude an overly broad interpretation that an isolated, limitedcontact with the United States would result in a loss of the safe harborfor the entire offering.\12\<NOTE/> As revised, the definition of ``directed selling efforts''includes only those activities that could reasonably be expected, or areintended, to condition the market with respect to the securities beingoffered in reliance upon the Regulation. As outlined in the Proposing Release,continuation of activities such as routine product advertising and routinecorporate communications. (<T3>e.g., </T3>press releases regarding the financial results of the issueror the occurrence of material events with respect to the issuer, providedno reference is made to the offering of securities) generally would notbe deemed to be ``directed selling efforts'' within the meaning of RegulationS.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Proposed rule 902(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Such a contact could constitute an offer in the UnitedStates, however, which would preclude reliance on Regulation S for thatspecific transaction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ 53 FR at 22667. <T3>See also </T3>Securities Act Release Nos. 3844 (Oct. 4, 1957) [22 FR8359] and 5009 (Oct. 7, 1969) [34 FR 16870]. However, where a company didnot have a history of disseminating routine corporate communications orproduct advertising and disseminated such information shortly before orduring an offshore offering, the activities might constitute directed sellingefforts. As an example of ``directed selling efforts,'' the Proposing Release cited``placing of advertisments * * * in publications with a general circulationin the United States, which discuss the offering or are otherwise intendedto condition the market for the securities purportedly being offered abroad* * *''\14\<NOTE/> Commenters requested further explanation of this prohibition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ 53 FR at 22667. Publications with a general circulation in the United States, as definedin the revised Regulation,\1\\5\<NOTE/> would include all publications printed in the United Statesprimarily for distribution in the United States, and all publications printedoutside the United States that, on average during the preceding twelvemonths, either have a circulation in the United States of 15,000 copiesor more per issue,\1\\6\<NOTE/> or have 50 percent or more of their circulation in the UnitedStates. Generally, foreign publications meeting such definition are producedas a separate edition for the United States. In such cases where the affiliatednon-U.S. edition does not itself meet the definition, only the U.S. editionwould be considered a publication of general circulation in the UnitedStates. An advertisment would not be deemed a directed selling effort inthe United States if publication of the advertisment was required by foreignlaw, and contained no more information than legally required. The numberof copies circulated per issue was set at 15,000 for purposes of the definitionof ``publications with a general circulation in the United States'' byreference to the circulation figures for publications that are likely tocontain advertisments that could precondition the U.S. market. Commentis solicited regarding whether that number is an appropriate indicatorof general circulation in the United States and, if not, whether the numbershould be raised (<T3>e.g., </T3>to 20,000) or lowered (<T3>e.g., </T3>to 10,000). Commenters are also requested to address whetherthe percentage level set is appropriate, or should be higher (<T3>e.g., </T3>60 or 75 percent) or lower (<T3>e.g., </T3>35 or 40 percent), and whether a rolling twelve-month averageis appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See </T3>Proposed Rule 902(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>The Financial Times </T3>and <T3>The Economist </T3>are examples of foreign publications meeting thisdescription. Some commenters expressed concern that the prohibition on directed sellingefforts would interfere with offshore offerings of interests in real estatelocated in the United States. The ``directed selling efforts'' definitionis not intended to preclude investigation of investment opportunities.Bona fide site visits to real estate, plants, or other facilities locatedin the United States and tours thereof conducted in the United States fora prospective investor by an issuer or persons acting on its behalf wouldnot be directed selling efforts if the issuer had extended an offer ofsecurities outside the United States to the prospective investor priorto the time of the visit or tour in the United States. Several commenters expressed concern that, given the prohibition againstdirected selling efforts, U.S. broker-dealers would be unable to rely uponthe Regulation if they initiated sales communications to non-U.S. personsfrom the United States. The Regulation's prohibition against directed sellingefforts made in the United States is not intended to preclude such activities.As noted in the Proposing Release,\1\\7\<NOTE/> the concept of directed selling efforts is not coextensivewith activities constituting ``solicitation,'' as that term is used inconsidering the need for registration as broker-dealer under the ExchangeAct. In a recent Release regarding the applicability of U.S. broker-dealerregistration requirements to foreign entities, and adopting Exchange ActRule 15a-6,\1\\8\<NOTE/> the concept of solicitation was defined by the Commissionas ``including any affirmative effort by a broker or dealer intended toinduce transaction business for the broker-dealer or its affiliates.''\1\\9\<NOTE/> Among the examples of solicitation noted in that Releasewere efforts to induce a single transaction, telephone calls from a broker-dealerto a customer encouraging use of the broker-dealer to effect transactions,and transmission of information, opinions, or recommendations to particularinvestors in the United States, whether directed at individuals or groups.While activities directed at a single customer or prospective investormay be offers for purposes of Regulation S or solicitation for purposesof Rule 15a-6, because of their limited effect, they would not generallyconstitute prohibited directed selling efforts. Nonetheless, while solicitationencompasses a broader range of activities than directed selling efforts,some activities would constitute both. For example, the transmission byparticipants of information, opinions or recommendations to groups of investorsin the United States with respect to securities being offered under theRegulation would be both directed selling efforts and offers for purposesof Regulation S and solicitation for purposes of Rule 15a-6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ 53 FR at 22667, n. 84. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ 17 CFR 240.15a-6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Exchange Act Release No., 34-27017 (July 11, 1989).Commenters stated that the dissemination in the United States of a broker-dealer'squotations for a security being offered and sold in reliance on the Regulationtechnically could violate the prohibition against directed selling efforts.\2\\0\<NOTE/> Questions regarding this aspect of ``directed selling efforts''typically would be decided on an individual interpretive basis. At thepresent time, however, U.S. distribution of foreign broker-dealers' quotationsby third-party systems, <T3>e.g., </T3>systems operated by foreign marketplaces or by private vendors,that distributed such quotations primarly in foreign countries would notbe deemed directed selling efforts or an offer, provided that: (i) Thosesystems did not enable securities transactions to be executed between foreignbroker-dealers and persons in the United States through the systems; and(ii) the issuer, distributors, foreign broker-dealers and other participantsin the systems did not initiate contracts with U.S. persons or personswithin the United States, beyond those contracts exempted under Rule 15a-6.The direct dissemination of a foreign market maker's quotations to U.S.persons or persons within the United States, such as through a privatequotation system controlled by a foreign broker-dealer, would, consistentwith Rule 15a-6, be viewed as both an offer and a directed selling effortgiven the direct, exclusive inducement to purchase the securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ The Commission notes, however, that in the contextof the broker-dealer registration requirements, Section 15(a)(1) of theExchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1)], the staff has given assurances that enforcement actionfor failure to register would not be recommended when, absent such registration,there has been a collective distribution by organized foreign exchangesof foreign market makers' quotations. <T3>See </T3>Exchange Act Release No. 25801 (June 14, 1988) [53 FR at 23647nn. 21-27 and accompanying text].<ITAG tagnum="81">2. ``Offshore Tranasaction'' </ITAG>As revised, the proposed definition of offshore transaction\2\\1\<NOTE/> has been expanded to encompass transactions executed on orthrough the facilities of a designated organized foreign securities market.\2\\2\<NOTE/> To qualify for that designation, a market would have to beorganized under foreign law, have an established operating history, andbe subject to oversight by a governmental or self-regulatory body to whichsecurities transactions are reported on a regular basis.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Specific foreign markets that would meet the requirementsof the definition are not individually identified in the definition.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Determination of ``designated organized foreign securitiesmarket'' status would be made on a case-by-case basis by the Division ofCorporation Finance through the interpretive letter process. The designationprocess would not be used for established foreign securities exchanges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Proposed Rule 902(g). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ As with transactions ``on or through the facilitiesof an established foreign securities exchange,'' designated organized foreignsecurities market transactions would include all transactions reportedto such a market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See </T3>Proposed Rule 902(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ The Eurobond market, as regulated by the Associationof International Bond Dealers, and the Unlisted Securities Market operatedby the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and the Republic ofIreland are two existing foreign securities markets that would meet theproposed definition of ``designated organized foreign securities market.''While commenters responding to the request for comment endorsed the extensionof ``offshore transaction'' to non-exchange markets, little specific suggestionwas provided on the definition or the mechanism for implementation. Commentis specifically requested as to the sufficiency and appropriateness ofthe factors in the proposed definition of ``designated organized foreignsecurities market'' and the proposed implementation procedures. Commentis also solicited regarding whether the following characteristics alsoshould be considered in making determinations regarding status as a designatedorganized foreign securities market: (i) A system for the quotation ofsecurities; (ii) a clearance and settlement system; and (iii) oversightstandards set by an existing body of law by the jurisdiction or organization.The prohibition against pre-arranging with buyers in the United Statestransactions taking place on or through the facilities of a foreign securitiesexchange has been modified in the revised definition. As originally proposed,the seller had a duty of investigation. As revised, the prohibition wouldextend only to cases in which the seller (or a person acting on the seller'sbehalf) knew that the transaction was pre-arranged. The proposed definition of ``offshore transaction'' required, for non-exchangetransactions, that the buyer be outside the United States at the time thebuy order was originated and that execution and delivery take place outsidethe United States. The definition would be modified to protect a sellerthat reasonably believed that the buyer was outside the United States atthat time and that execution and delivery took place overseas. C. Issuer Safe HarborThe issuer safe harbor \25\<NOTE/> would apply to issuers, securities professionals involvedin the distribution process pursuant to contract, and their affiliates.\26\<NOTE/> The proposed issuer safe harbor distinguished among threeclasses of securities, based on nationality and reporting status of theissuer and the degree of U.S. market interest in the issuer's securities.Varying procedural safeguards were imposed on the categories to ensurethat the securities offered would come to rest offshore. The first issuersafe harbor category, with no procedural restrictions other than the offshoretransaction requirement and directed selling efforts prohibition, wouldhave been available under the original proposal for offerings of securitiesby non-reporting foreign issuers with no substantial U.S. market interestin any class of their securities. The second safe harbor category wouldhave been available for offerings of securities by reporting issuers. Thethird safe harbor category, with the most procedural restrictions, wouldhave been available for all issuers offering securities, including non-reportingU.S. issuers and non-reporting foreign issuers with substantial U.S. marketinterest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Proposed Rule 905.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ The original proposal defined the term ``distributor''to mean any underwriter, prospective underwriter, dealer, or other personparticipating, pursuant to a contractual arrangement, in the distributionof securities sold in reliance on the Regulation. Clarification was requestedregarding when a distributor would cease to be treated as a distributorunder the Regulation. Distributors would remain distributors under theRegulation for the duration of the distribution and the subsequent restrictedperiod (which includes all offers and sales by a distributor holding anunsold allotment or subscription).The revised proposed issuer safe harbor would continue to distinguish amongthree categories of securities offerings, based on nationality and reportingstatus of the issuer and the degree of U.S. market interest in the issuer'ssecurities. The scope of each of the three issuer safe harbor categories,however, would be changed substantially in the revised proposed safe harbor.Under the reproposal, the first category would extend to offers and salesof securities by all foreign issuers with no substantial U.S. market interest,regardless of their reporting status, and overseas domestic offerings byforeign issuers.\27\<NOTE/> The revised second category would include securities offeredand sold by reporting issuers and debt securities offered and sold by foreignissuers regardless of their reporting status.\28\<NOTE/> The residual third issuer safe harbor category would be availablefor all issuers offering securities, including non-reporting U.S. issuersand non-reporting foreign issuers offering equity securities with a substantialU.S. market interest.\29\<NOTE/> Appendix A is a chart showing which issuer safe harbor categorywould be available for any given Regulation S offering by the issuer, adistributor or an affiliate. Reference should be made to the text of theproposed Regulation for a full understanding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 905(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 905(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 905(c).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Category 1: Foreign Issuers With No Substantial U.S. Market Interest;Overseas Domestic Offerings</ITAG>Recognizing that securities issued by foreign issuers generally are likelyto flow back to their major or home market, the Commission is now proposingthat offers and sales of securities of foreign issuers for which the UnitedStates is not a primary market be subject to fewer restrictions than originallyproposed. Three major revisions to the first of the issuer safe harborcategories have been made to implement that determination: the definitionof the term ``substantial U.S. market interest'' has been narrowed, thefirst category has been extended to offerings by reporting as well as non-reportingforeign issuers with no substantial U.S. market interest, and ``overseasdomestic offerings'' have been added to the first category.a. <T3>Revision to ``Substantial U.S. Market Interest''. </T3>The definitionof ``substantial U.S. market interest'' \30\<NOTE/> has been revised \31\<NOTE/> with respect to a class of a foreign issuer's equity securitiesso that, to qualify for the first category, the issuer must establish atthe commencement of the offering that either: (i) More than 50 percentof all recorded trading in that class of securities in the issuer's priorfiscal year took place on or through the facilities of a single establishedforeign securities exchange or designated organized foreign securitiesmarket;\32\<NOTE/> or (ii) less than 20 percent of recorded trading in thatclass of securities in the issuer's prior fiscal year took place on orthrough the facilities of securities exchanges and inter-dealer quotationsystems \33\<NOTE/> in the United States and the U.S. markets \34\<NOTE/> in the aggregate did not constitute the single largest marketfor such securities. Listing on a U.S. exchange, quotation on NASDAQ andsponsorship of an American depositary receipt (``ADR'') facility wouldno longer determine U.S. market interest in an issuer's equity securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Proposed Rule 902(<T3>1</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Citing the difficulty of determining the extent of holdingsand the amount of trading in the United States, a significant number ofcommenters concluded that many foreign issuers would be unjustifiably forcedto assume that they had a ``substantial U.S. market interest.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See supra </T3>text accompanying nn. 22-24.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ ``Inter-dealer quotation system'' would mean any systemof general circulation to brokers or dealers which regularly disseminatesquotations of identified brokers or dealers, as defined in Exchange ActRule 15c-11(e)(2) [17 CFR 240.15c2-11(e)(2)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ These markets would include the U.S. stock exchanges,the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System(``NASDAQ''), and bid and asked questions in the current ``pink sheets''of the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. To the extent an inter-dealer quotationsystem did not record all trading in a security, an issuer would take intoaccount only the amount of trading that was recorded to the extent it ispublicly available.With respect to debt securities, substantial U.S. market interest wouldexist under the revised definition unless the issuer could establish atthe commencement of the offering either that its debt securities \35\<NOTE/> were held of record by fewer than 300 U.S. persons, or thatless than $1 billion principal amount of its debt securities was held ofrecord by U.S. persons. In response to public comment, the threshold principalamount held by U.S. persons has been raised from $100 million in the proposeddefinition to $1 billion in the reproposed definition. This revision shouldalleviate the expressed concern that the lower amount was too small a figure,without consideration of any other factor, to be a good indicator of marketinterest. The Commission requests comment on whether a lower thresehold(<T3>e.g., </T3>$500 million) would provide a more appropriate test of substantialmarket interest, whether the threshold should be higher (<T3>e.g., </T3>$2 billion), and whether the percentage of the issuer'soutstanding debt securities held by U.S. persons should be considered.Issuers that had more than $1 billion of debt securities held in the UnitedStates would be able to rely on the existence of only a limited numberof investors in the United States to demonstrate lack of substantial U.S.market interest for their debt securities. The addition of the number-of-holderstest would minimize inequitable treatment of larger debt issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Unlike measurement for equity securities, which wouldbe by class, substantial U.S. market interest in debt would be measuredby reference to all outstanding classes of debt securities. The all-encompassingmeasurement for debt would be appropriate because issuers may create differentclasses of debt with relative ease.Issuers of excluding issuers with substantial U.S. market interest in anyclass of their securities, as initially proposed, the revised first categoryof the issuer safe harbor would exclude foreign issuers of equity securitiesonly if such market interest existed in the specific class of equity securitiesbeing offered and would exclude debt issuers only if there were substantialU.S. market interest in their debt securities. U.S. market interest inan issuer's debt would not be viewed as implying market interest in anissuer's equity and vice versa. Different factors are considered by investorsin purchasing fixed income securities than in purchasing participatingequity interests. Moreover, there is little empirical evidence that theinvestor base is necessarily the same for both types of securities.b. <T3>Extension to Foreign Reporting Issuers.</T3> Rather than applying onlyto non-reporting foreign issuers with no substantial U.S. market interestas originally proposed, the first category with no substantial U.S. marketinterest, including reporting issuers. As noted above, the potential forflowback depends on the location of the primary market for the securities,and is unaffected by the reporting status of the issuer. Moreover, exclusionof reporting foreign issuers from this category could unfairly disadvantageforeign issuers that choose to subject themselves to U.S. reporting requirements.<T3>c. Addition of ``Overseas Domestic Offering''.</T3> The third majorrevision to the first issuer safe harbor category is addition of ``overseasdomestic offerings'' of foreign issuers.\3\\6\<NOTE/> Such offerings would be included in this category whetheror not there was substantial U.S. market interest in the foreign issuer'ssecurities. Several commenters suggested that offerings of securities byforeign issuers targeted to a particular foreign jurisdiction be subjectto less restrictive safe harbor conditions than multijurisdictional offeringsby foreign issuers. Consistent with the territorial approach of RegulationS, the primacy of the law governing an issuer's home market should be recognizedwhen an offering of securities is closely targeted to the market. The principleof comity and the reasonable expectations of participants support relianceupon the disclosure requirements of the issuer's home market in those circumstances.To prevent an indirect distribution in the United States, however, as withall other categories of issuers, directed selling efforts in the UnitedStates would be prohibited and the offer and sale would have to be madeoffshore.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ Proposed Rule 905(a)(2).Under the proposal, ``overseas domestic offering'' would be defined tomean ``an offering of securities by a foreign issuer directed to citizensor residents of the issuer's national jurisdiction of incorporation ororganization or, if the issuer is a foreign government, to citizens orresidents of the jurisdiction governed by the issuer, and made in accordancewith customary local practices and documentation.''\3\\7\<NOTE/> Of particular importance is the requirement that such offeringbe ``directed'' at the domestic market. Where the foreign issuer or distributorknew or was reckless in not knowing that a substantial portion of the offeringwould be immediately resold outside the domestic market, such an offeringwould not be ``directed'' at that market and the safe harbor would be unavailablein that situation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ Proposed Rule 902(h).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Category 2: Reporting Issuers; Foreign Issuers' Debt</ITAG><T3>a. Addition of Foreign Issuer Debt. </T3>As originally proposed, thesecond issuer safe harbor category applied to securities offerings of allforeign and domestic reporting issuers. As discussed above, securitiesof foreign reporting issuers with no substantial U.S. market interest havebeen moved to the revised first category. The second category \3\\8\<NOTE/> has been expanded so that it would apply to offerings ofdebt securities of any foreign issuer, whether or not the issuer had continuousreporting obligations under the Exchange Act. The inclusion of debt ofnon-reporting foreign issuers in this category reflects the view that offeringrestrictions applicable to the category provide adequate protection againstan indirect U.S. distribution because of the institutional nature of themarket and the trading characteristics of debt. Moreover, because debtis usually issued in separate classes, debt securities can be tracked moreeasily if there are resales directed into the United States.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ Proposed Rule 905(b).<T3>b. Reduction in Length of Restricted Period.</T3> In addition to themodifications in scope, the transactional and offering restrictions applicableto the second issuer safe harbor category have been amended. The restrictedperiod applicable to securities in this category, during which offers andsale could not be made in the United States or to U.S. persons, would bereduced from 90 days to 40 days.\3\\9\<NOTE/> Commenters advocated this change, stating that it parallelsthe 40-day period in section 4(3) of the Act,\4\\0\<NOTE/> and that the shorter period is sufficient to protect againstuse of an offshore offering to make an indirect offering into the UnitedStates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Proposed Rule 905(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ 15 U.S.C. 77d(3)The Commission initially solicited comment on requiring a 40-day restrictedperiod only for securities of issuers such as foreign governments and largeissuers with a worldwide market following.\4\\1\<NOTE/> The modification made in the revised proposed Rule is notlimited to such issuers in light of the experience recounted by commentersthat all offerings tend to come to rest within 40 days. Comment is requestedas to whether the securities of any group of issuers in the second categoryshould be subject to a 90-day or longer period rather than a 40-day restrictedperiod.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ 53 FR at 22670.<T3>c. Treatment of ADR Programs.</T3> The analysis and treatment of salesof ADRs during a restricted period has been changed. Under the Regulationas originally proposed, deposit of securities into an ADR facility wouldhave been absolutely precluded for the length of the restricted periodapplicable to securities in the second and third issuer safe harbor categories.The revised analysis would focus on the sale by a depositary of ADRs representingsecurities of the class distributed. Such sales would be permitted if (1)the ADRs represented securities acquired by the depositary prior to thedistribution, or (2) the depositary determined by examination of the certificateor other evidence that the security to be deposited was not subject toa restricted period and was neither borrowed nor deposited with the intentionthat it be replaced with securities subject to the restricted period. Whetherany sales could be made during the restricted period would depend in parton what steps the issuer of deposited securities would be willing or ableto take to identify the securities it distributed.\4\\2\<NOTE/> Issuance of ADRs in exchange for underlying securities andwithdrawal of deposited securities by ADR holders would not be precludedby the safe harbor provisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ This would conform to current practice. Several commentersstated that, in their experience, issuers have assisted depositaries inidentification of securities not involved in the distribution, at leastin the case of sponsored ADR facilities. Those commenters further relatedthat the current practice is to close ADR facilities when securities cannotbe so identified.A single method of identifying the securities in question is not specifiedbecause a particular method may not be consistent with applicable rulesin all countries. Examples of possible methods of identifying securitiesnewly distributed, some of which were noted by commenters, would includethe underlining of dates, the use of different colors for the certificates,the use of legends, the use of selected certificate numbers and the codingof securities by the transfer agent. Unlike the proposed Regulation, therevision does not contain any reference ot the treatment of sales of ADRsduring a restricted period. Comment is requested as to whether the treatmentof such ADR sales discussed above should be reflected in the Regulation.d. <T3>Changes to Confirmation Requirement. </T3>As originally proposed, theRegulation would have required that distributors and dealers purchasingfrom distributors receive confirmations binding them to restrictions onoffers and sales.\43\<NOTE/> Commenters noted that the requirement that the confirmationsbe binding would raise difficult legal interpretative issues, and the Regulationas revised \44\<NOTE/> would require only that the confirmation note the applicablerestrictions. In addition, the rule has been revised to refer to deliveryrather than receipt.\45\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ Commenters suggested that the confirmation requirementbe modified in light of the movement towards paperless markets. Both theproposed definition and the revised proposed definition, by use of thephrasing ``confirmation or other notice,'' would accommodate paperlesstransactions. The ``other notice'' could include a notice given on screenrather than on paper or a notice given on the telephone, provided thatthe seller kept written records of notices given.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Proposed Rule 905(b)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ As revised, the confirmation requirement would no longerbe considered part of the offering restrictions, due to liability considerations.<T3>See infra </T3>Section II.G.e. <T3>Changes to Offering Restrictions. </T3>The definition of ``offeringrestrictions'' \46\<NOTE/> would require that offering materials and documents includea statement to the effect that the securities have not been registeredand may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons(other than a distributor) within the restricted period absent registrationor an exemption.\47\<NOTE/> A provision has been added that would allow the statementto appear in abbreviated form on prospectus cover pages and in advertisementsor press releases.\48\<NOTE/> Since the underwriting section of the prospectus would stillbe required to include the full statement, a summary statement on the coverpage would be adequate to serve as notice of the restrictions. The briefnature of advertisements and press releases would justify the condensedform of the statement while still providing the necessary notice of restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Proposed Rule 902(f).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ The addition of ``(other than a distributor)'' to therequirement of a statement has been made in the revised proposed definitionto clarify that the reference to the prohibition on sales in the UnitedStates or to U.S. persons was not intended to preclude U.S. persons fromparticipating as underwriters or selling dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Proposed Rule 902(f)(2).  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Category 3: Non-Reporting U.S. Issuers; Equity Offerings by Non-ReportingForeign Issuers With Substantial U.S. Market Interest  </ITAG>As reproposed, the third category \49\<NOTE/> remains the residual category. It would, however, generallybe used only for offerings by non-reporting U.S. issuers and for equityofferings by non-reporting foreign issuers with substantial U.S. marketinterest. The restricted periods that would apply to securities offeringswithin this category would vary, as in the proposed rule, depending uponwhether debt or equity were offered. The restricted period of 90 days fordebt securities of non-reporting U.S. issuers has been reduced to 40 days.\50\<NOTE/> The one-year restricted period for equity securities wouldbe retained.\51\<NOTE/> The revisions to the confirmation requirement \52\<NOTE/> and the definition of ``offering restrictions'' \53\<NOTE/> discussed above in connection with the second safe harborcategory would also apply to this category.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Proposed Rule 905(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ Proposed Rule 905(c)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Proposed Rule 905(c)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ Proposed Rule 905(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Proposed Rule 902(f). The original proposal would have required that each subsequent purchaserof equity securities enter into an agreement that it would resell the securitiesonly in accordance with the Regulation, or pursuant to registration oran exemption therefrom. Under the revised proposal, only a purchaser thatbought from a distributor would be required to enter into such an agreement.Issuers would continue to be required, however, to refuse to register anytransfer of the securities not made in accordance with the provisions ofthe Regulation.D. Resale Safe Harbor  Under the original resale safe harbor, resales could have been made byeither of two methods.\54\<NOTE/> First, resales could have been made in the same manner thatsuch securities could have been offered and sold pursuant to the issuersafe harbor, except that offering restrictions would not have applied (althoughpurchasers would have been required to receive confirmations with the resalerestrictions outlined). Under the second method, resale of securities encompassedby the first and second issuer safe harbor categories could have been madeon or through the facilities of an established foreign securities exchangeso long as the seller did not know that any counter-party was a U.S. person.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Several commenters on the proposed Regulation statedthat the resale safe harbor might be interpreted as somehow altering theavailability of Sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Securities Act for the resaleof securities. Neither the proposed Regulation nor the revised proposedRegulation is intended to affect the availability of the exemptions containedin those Sections.As reproposed, the resale safe harbor \55\<NOTE/> would distinguish between two types of sellers: (1) dealersand persons receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration inrespect of the securities offered or sold;\56\<NOTE/> and (2) all other persons.\57\<NOTE/> Persons receiving selling concessions, fees or other remunerationwould be included in the same category as dealers so that securities professionalsnot encompassed by the definition in Section 2(12) of the Securities Act,\58\<NOTE/> including subunderwriters, would be treated the same as dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Proposed Rule 906.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Proposed Rule 906(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Proposed Rule 906(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(12).Persons who are not dealers and do not receive a selling concession, feeor other remuneration would be able to resell any securities with no restrictionsother than the general conditions that the offer and sale be made offshoreand without directed selling efforts.\59\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Like the original proposal, the revised Regulation providesthat a directed selling effort by a person other than the seller or anyperson acting on his behalf would not affect the seller's ability to relyon the resale safe harbor.Resales by dealers and persons receiving selling concessions, fees or otherremuneration also would be subject to the general conditions. If the securitiesresold were of a type within the second or third issuer safe harbor categoriesand the resale were made within any applicable restricted period, the selleror any person acting on his behalf could not knowingly offer or sell toa U.S. person. If the purchaser of the securities were a dealer or personreceiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration, the seller wouldin addition be required to deliver a confirmation or other notice of theapplicable restrictions to the purchaser. Paralleling the issuer safe harbor,the confirmation requirement in the resale safe harbor has been revisedto delete the requirement that it must be binding on the recipient andto require delivery rather than receipt. To alleviate concerns of the commenters, the revised resale safe harborwould relieve persons who are not securities professionals from the requirementto deliver notices. The revised resale safe harbor also would permit resalesof any securities on established foreign securities exchanges and designatedorganized foreign securities markets. The original proposal would havelimited such resales to securities in the first and second issuer safeharbor categories. Although the safe harbor would no longer specificallyrefer to resales on established foreign securities exchanges, such resales(and resales on designated organized foreign securities markets) wouldbe allowed. With respect to dealer resales on such foreign exchanges ormarkets in the revised safe harbor, notice delivery would be required onlyif the seller or other person acting on its behalf knew that the purchaserwere a dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration.E. D<T3>efinition of ``U.S. Person''</T3>The definition of ``U.S. person'' \60\<NOTE/> has been changed in a number of respects in the revised Regulation.Unlike the original proposal, an entity organized under foreign law bya U.S. institution principally for the purpose of its investing in securitiesnot registered under the Securities Act would not be treated as a U.S.person. A U.S. institutional investor should be able to choose to establishan entity outside the United States, and should not expect the registrationprovisions to apply to purchases made by that foreign entity. Treatingsuch entities as U.S. persons would not be in accordance with comity andthe reasonable expectations of the parties.\6\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ Proposed Rule 902(m).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ The proposed definition of ``U.S. person'' would haveexcluded foreign branches and agencies of U.S. persons engaged in bankingor insurance that are established outside the United States, substantivelyregulated in their countries of establishment, operated for valid businesspurposes, and not formed principally for investing in securities not registeredunder the Securities Act. A number of commenters recommended that thisexclusion be extended to entities outside the banking and insurance industries.The Commission is not proposing such an extension because, outside theregulated industries, the concept of an ``agency'' or ``branch'' does nothave an established meaning.In a reversal of the position taken in the <T3>Baer Securities Corporation</T3> letter,\62\<NOTE/> the originally proposed definition of U.S. person would haveincluded any discretionary or similar account held by a dealer or otherfiduciary located in the United States, regardless of whether the beneficialowner of such account was a U.S. person. Citing competitive disadvantagesand loss of efficiency for U.S. money managers, commenters vigorously opposedthe proposed reversal, and urged that U.S. fiduciaries be treated as non-U.S.persons when acting with discretion for a non-U.S. person. A number ofthe commenters disagreed with the view, expressed in the Proposing Release,that concerns regarding competitiveness abroad would be adequately addressedby the safe harbor exemption from registration for certain institutionalresales proposed in Rule 144A.\6\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ <T3>See supra</T3> n. 5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Act Release No. 6839 (July 11, 1989) (reproposingRule 144A); Securities Act Release No. 6806 (Oct. 25, 1988) [53 FR 44016](proposing Rule 144A).The Commission is proposing to except from the conceptual framework ofRegulation S U.S. professional fiduciaries acting for foreign investors,\64\<NOTE/> in light of the serious competitive disadvantages that mightbe faced by U.S. professional fiduciaries, particularly by smaller U.S.advisers, even if proposed Rule 144A were adopted. Thus, under the revisedproposal, U..S professional fiduciaries acting with discretion would bedeemed U.S. persons for purposes of Regulation S only when they were actingfor U.S. persons. Any offer or sale to a U.S. professional fiduciary actingfor a foreign investor in reliance on the Regulation, however, would stillbe required to be made outside the United States.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 902(m)(1).Certain multinational organizations were specifically excluded from theproposed definition of ``U.S. persons.'' Commenters on this aspect of theproposed definition generally favored exclusion of such organizations,but also believed that the same treatment should be afforded to other entities.The definition has been revised to exclude from the definition of U.S.person the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, the InternationalBank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American DevelopmentBank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank andall similar multinational entities.\6\\5\<NOTE/> The staff interpretive letter process will be available forfuture questions regarding exclusion for specific multinational organizations.In response to commenters' recommendations and consistent with ExchangeAct Rule 15a-6, \6\\6\<NOTE/> pension plans of such multinational organizations are alsoexcluded from the revised proposed definition of U.S. person.

Continuous OfferingsCommenters on the Proposing Release raised strong objection to the timingof commencement of the restricted period in the case of continuous offeringsof securities such as medium-term notes that are offered on a daily basis.They concluded that the proposed Regulation would impose an indefiniterestricted period because such a distribution is never completed. Amongthe commenter's suggestions for resolution of this issue was a recommendationthat separate tranches of medium-term note offerings be treated as separateofferings with distinct restricted periods.In order to grant relief from the effective preclusion of such sales toU.S. persons, in the case of certain offerings of debt securities issuedin clearly distinct and identifiable tranches or issues, the 40-day restrictedperiod would commence upon completion of the distribution of that trancheor issue, as certified by the lead managing underwriter or person performingsimilar functions.\6\\7\<NOTE/> At the end of the restricted period, the issuer would befree to offer another tranche. In such cases, no integration of the tranchesor issues would be required.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\ Proposed Rule 902(k).G. Safe Harbor ProtectionsA violation of a term or condition of an issuer safe harbor would haveone of two results: Either the safe harbor would be lost by all personsfor all offers and sales made in the offering, or the safe harbor wouldbe lost only by the person failing to comply with the term or conditionfor the securities offered or sold in the non-complying transaction. Asthe Proposing Release stated, no one could rely upon the issuer safe harborprovisions of the Regulation if directed selling efforts were made in theUnited States by the issuer, a distributor, or an affiliate of either.\68\<NOTE/> Thus, directed selling efforts by one distributor would eliminatethe safe harbor protection of the Regulation for the issuer, all otherdistributors, and all affiliates of both for all securities offered andsold. Failure on the part of an issuer, distributor, or affiliate to complywith the offering restrictions likewise would result in the safe harbornot being available to all persons for offers and sales of securities inthe offering.\69\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ 53 FR at 22669. In contrast, the directed selling effortsof any person would result only in loss of the safe harbor protection forresales by that person.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ <T3>Id</T3>.In contrast, if a particular offer or sale was not made in an offshoretransaction, the safe harbor protection from a Section 5 violation wouldnot be available to the offeror or seller who did not comply, but the safeharbor would still be available to any complying issuer, distributor, oraffiliate. For failures to meet offshore transaction requirements, eachoffer and sale would be examined separately and a non-complying offer orsale would not eliminate the safe harbor protection for other offers andsales. Thus, if 10,000 shares were sold in the United States and 3,000,000shares were sold in offshore transactions, the safe harbor protection wouldbe lost only with respect to the 10,000 shares and only for the personthat made the U.S. sales. Similarly, with respect to compliance with theprohibition against selling to U.S. persons during the restricted period,consistent with the original proposal,\70\<NOTE/> the failure of the issuer, a distributor, or an affiliateof either to comply would not destroy the safe harbor protection for otheroffers and sales by that participant or any of the offers and sales ofanother participant. For example, a sale of 100 shares of stock of a non-reportingdomestic issuer made by a participant to a U.S. person 5 days into therestricted period without the benefit of an exemption or registration wouldresult in loss of the safe harbor only for that participant and only withrespect to those 100 shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ 53 FR at 22671.Because of its transactional and ongoing nature, the requirement that aconfirmation or other notice be given has been moved out of the categoryof offering restrictions, into the transactional obligations mandated duringthe restricted period.\71\<NOTE/> Thus, failure to comply with the notice requirement wouldnot affect the availability of the safe harbor offering as a whole, andwould affect only the non-complying sale.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rules 905(b)(3) and 905(c)(4).Preliminary Note 2, which remains unchanged from the proposed Regulation,would state that the Regulation is not available to any transaction orseries of transactions that, although in technical compliance with therules, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisionsof the Securities Act. Thus, a participant in a distribution, regardlessof whether it literally took all steps required for reliance upon the protectionof the Regulation, would lose the protection of the Regulation if it hadknowledge or was reckless in not knowing that a person to whom it soldsecurities in reliance upon the Regulation would not comply with the requirements.Clearly, if an underwriter were told by a dealer to whom it intended tosell securities in reliance upon the Regulation that the dealer had a customerin New York waiting for the securities, that underwriter should not beable to rely upon the protection of the Regulation in connection with itssale to that dealer, even if the underwriter complied with all the Regulation'srequirements. The same could be true if the underwriter knew or was recklessin not knowing that the dealer to whom it intended to sell had consistentlysold to U.S. residents in violation of resale restrictions in other offeringsmade pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Regulation. If, on theother hand, an underwiter sold to a dealer and the dealer sold to a customerin the United States, and the underwriter did not know and was not recklessin failing to know that the non-conforming sale would occur, the underwriterwould not lose the protection of the Regulation.H. Interaction With U.S. Tax LawThe proposed Regulation would affect certain regulations of the InternalRevenue Service which impose sanctions on issuers of otherwise ``registration-required''obligations in bearer form unless such obligations are issued pursuantto ``arrangements reasonably designed'' to ensure sales to persons whoare not ``U.S. persons.'' The regulations that prescribe procedures tobe followed in the issuance, sale, and delivery of such obligations inorder to satisfy the ``arrangements reasonably designed'' test are basedin part upon applicable securities laws. The effect of the proposed Regulationon the tax law and regulations has been extensively reviewed with the Departmentof the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. The Commission has beenadvised that the Department and the Service intend to publish, in proposedform, a revised regulation concerning the procedures for issuing foreign-targetedbearer debt obligations. The revised regulation will reflect the requirementsof proposed Regulation S, but with two significant differences. First,the tax regulations will use the definition of ``United States person''set forth in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code,\72\<NOTE/> which includes citizens as well as residents of the UnitedStates. Second, the tax regulations generally will require a certificatestating that, as of the last day of the restricted period, the beneficialowner of the debt security is not a U.S. person.\73\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(30).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ An exception will be provided for certain foreign currencyobligations.I.

Request For Comments</ITAG>Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on revised proposedRegulation S, as well as other matters that might have an impact on theproposal, are requested to do so.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>As in the Proposing Release, the Commission invites commenters to provideviews and data as to the costs and benefits associated with the proposedrevised Regulation intended to clarify the extraterritorial effect of theregistration provisions of the Securities Act. It appears to the Commissionthat, while there may be some additional costs to issuers, distributorsor other sellers associated with structuring a transaction in accordancewith the requirements of a safe harbor or the General Statement, such costsmay be outweighed by the savings of the costs of registration and the benefitderived from assurance that registration need not be undertaken. In addition,the Commission believes that the proposed streamlined method to assurethat the securities come to rest outside the United States would also reducecosts. The Regulation, as reproposed, would further alleviate costs incomparison to the originally proposed Regulation in view of the changesmade to the issuer safe harbor, including the fact that more issuers wouldbe eligible to take advantage of the issuer safe harbor categorizes withfewer procedural restrictions. In addition, the liberalization of the resaleprovisions under the reproposed Regulation should result in further costreductions to persons relying on that safe harbor.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C.603 has been prepared concerning the proposed Regulation. The analysisnotes that the proposed Regulation is intended to clarify the extraterritorialapplication of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.The proposed Regulation will not result in any significant increase inreporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements. No alternatives tothe proposed Regulation consistent with its objectives were found. Alternativessuch as establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirementsbased on the size of the issuer alone were rejected as inconsistent withthe goals of the Securities Act. Clarification, consolidation or simplificationof compliance and reporting requirements for small entities under the Regulationwas also rejected as an alternative since the Regulation is itself clarificationand simplification and additional simplification would not be consistentwith the statutory mandate. Small entities, like any other issuers, areentitled to the benefits of the guidance provided by the General Statementand the safe harbors.A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Sara Hanks, Officeof International Corporate Finance, Division of Corporation Finance, U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,DC 20549.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
