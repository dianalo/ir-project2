SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two centuries after the United States wasfounded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of thepopulation growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the CensusBureau reports.   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urbanareas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patternsof growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growingfaster than that in rural areas.   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small townsand rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases incities and suburbs now well in the lead.   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation'spopulation growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officiallydesignated metropolitan areas across the country. That patternrepresents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that hasbeen common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureaureported.   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of allAmericans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas withpopulations of a million or more.   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely includedwithin metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portionof the state is included in the greater New York metro area whilethe southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of theirpopulations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percentof its residents in urban areas, the report added.   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitanarea growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recentyears, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patternsbetween 1980 and 1987.   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while theMidwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 inmuch of the interior of the United States, especially innonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, thebureau pointed out.   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as ofJuly 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1million; Dallas, 3.7 million;   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,R.I., 1.1 million; Charlotte, N.C., 1.1 million; Hartford, Conn.,1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.
