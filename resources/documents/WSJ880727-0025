Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CHV TX P AHC </CO><IN> ERN PET </IN><TEXT>   Three more big oil companies posted higher second-quarter earnings, boosted by strong profits in refining, marketing and chemicals operations. A midsized concern reported a loss for the period.    Chevron Corp. posted a 45% increase in net income to $520 million, or $1.52 a share, from $358 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Texaco Inc.'s net quadrupled to $527 million, or $2.17 a share, from $129 million, or 53 cents a share, bolstered by a $301 million gain in the latest second quarter from the sale of its West German unit, Deutsche Texaco. Phillips Petroleum Co.'s earnings soared to $170 million, or 72 cents a share, from $3 million.    But midsized Amerada Hess Corp. had a loss of $23.5 million, compared with net income of $89.4 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier.    Despite the strong performance of the big oil companies' so-called &quot;downstream&quot; businesses -- refining, marketing, and chemical operations -- both Chevron and Texaco said their &quot;upstream&quot; operations -- exploration and production -- were hurt by lower crude oil prices and higher exploration expenses, an industrywide trend.    CHEVRON: The San Francisco-based company's revenue was flat at $7.3 billion, but Chairman George Keller noted that &quot;sales margins for petroleum products were the highest in two years, and our chemical operations continue to benefit from strong demand in the industrial market.&quot; He added that while higher margins reflected lower crude oil costs, Chevron also has reduced other manufacturing and marketing costs.    Gains on asset sales added $177 million in the latest quarter, offset by $45 million of charges relating to environmental programs and prior years' tax adjustments. In the 1987 quarter, asset sales and other items increased earnings by $144 million. Earnings also included foreign exchange gains of $16 million, compared with $7 million a year earlier.    Operating profit from U.S. exploration and production fell to $78 million -- after the benefit of a $71 million adjustment to prior years' taxes -- from last year's $109 million. Foreign exploration and production profit fell to $106 million from $214 million.    Chevron's domestic refining, marketing and transportation operations had a quarterly operating profit of $91 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $6 million, while foreign operating profit rose slightly to $32 million from $28 million.    The profit of chemical operations increased to $76 million from $67 million. The company's minerals business earned $184 million, including a $177 million gain from the sale of investments, compared with $8 million a year earlier.    Separately, Chevron said its Chevron International Oil Co. unit formed two joint-venture companies with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. to market petroleum products in West Africa.    TEXACO: Revenue of the White Plains, N.Y.-based company climbed 11% to $9.4 billion from $8.5 billion.    Foreign exchange gains added $36 million to the latest quarter's net, compared with a $9 million loss last year. Corporate and nonoperating expenses widened to $252 million from $98 million, primarily reflecting a $75 million tax benefit in last year's quarter. In addition, it had higher legal and other expenses associated with the company's emergence from bankruptcylaw proceedings in the spring and a proxy battle with dissident shareholder Carl C. Icahn, who holds a 14.8% stake.    Texaco's profit from domestic exploration and production rose to $44 million from $41 million, while the non-U.S. total fell to $134 million from $165 million. The results reflected a $19 million net gain from an agreement with Britoil PLC.    Domestic manufacturing and marketing operations showed an operating profit of $108 million in the quarter, compared with a $12 million loss. Profit from foreign manufacturing and marketing climbed to $107 million from $30 million. Texaco's petrochemical operations earned $44 million, up from $19 million, it said.    PHILLIPS PETROLEUM: The Bartlesville, Okla., company's revenue climbed 9% to $2.88 billion from $2.64 billion. Net included foreign currency gains of $27 million, compared with a $6 million loss a year ago.    Domestic exploration and production had a small operating profit of $6 million, compared with a $16 million operating loss a year earlier, while profit from non-U.S. exploration and production rose to $106 million from $70 million.    Profit from the company's downstream operations more than doubled in the quarter to $98 million from $48 million, as did profit from chemicals, which jumped to $237 million from $110 million.    AMERADA HESS: Revenue at the New York-based company fell 24% to $882.8 million from $1.16 billion. Refining and marketing operations had a loss of $6.5 million compared with operating profit of $55.7 million a year earlier. Operating profit from exploration and production also fell sharply, to $1.2 million from $44 million. </TEXT></DOC>
