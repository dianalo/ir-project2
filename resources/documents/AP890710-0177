(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's former executive secretarysaid Monday she had unlimited authority to sign the TV evangelist'sname on checks and other documents.   ``He liked it (the signature) to look like his,'' said ShirleyFulbright, testifying at the federal tax evasion trial of two formerPTL officials, brothers David and James Taggart. ``I tried my best.''   Miss Fulbright also said David Taggart once boasted he had jobsecurity at PTL because of things he knew about Bakker, who builtthe evangelical empire before stepping down in 1987 in a sex andmoney scandal.   ``I vaguely remember a comment he made in jest, jokingly, inwhich he said something to the effect that Mr. Bakker would not firehim or me because of some of the things we knew about him,'' MissFulbright said.   ``He laughingly said he knew a lot about Jim Bakker. That'sall,'' she said when pressed by special prosecutor David Brown forspecifics.   The Taggarts are charged with failing to pay $487,000 in taxesfrom 1984 to 1987 on $1.1 million that prosecutors say the Taggartsdiverted from the ministry for their personal use by taking cashadvances on PTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks.   Bakker is charged in Charlotte, N.C., with fraud and conspiracyconcerning PTL operations. A federal magistrate ruled Monday thatBakker can be tried in that city without fear of pretrial publicitybecause two years have elapsed since his resignation drew mediacoverage of the ``holy war'' in television ministries.   Miss Fulbright testified that she signed Bakker's name to severaldocuments authorizing payment to the Taggarts without Bakker'sknowledge. One memorandum authorized PTL to pay James Taggart'sinterior design firm a $10,000-a-month retainer. Another authorizeda $100,000 payment to the firm.   She said she also signed an authorization to pay David Taggart a$120,000 bonus shortly before Bakker's resignation.   Miss Fulbright testified she signed Bakker's name at thedirection of David Taggart.   ``Did this ever cause you concern, Miss Fulbright,'' Brown askedher.   ``At that moment, I did not know what it represented,'' she said.``Later on, I realized what they did represent.''   Under cross-examination, Miss Fulbright testified that Bakkerpreviously had given her the authority to sign his name ondocuments, including checks, letters and memos. Miss Fulbright saidshe knew of no limitations on her authority to use Bakker'ssignature and said her work was personally examined by Bakker.   ``I assumed I could sign everything ... if it were necessary,''she said.   Witnesses have testified that the Taggarts shared expenses on anapartment in exclusive Trump Towers in New York City, gave eachother Jaguars for Christmas presents and bought expensive jewelry atCartier and Gucci.   If convicted, the Taggarts could each receive 30 years in prisonand fines totaling $1.35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
