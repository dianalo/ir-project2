<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0244 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Atomic Minerals Division is engaged in surveying for various atomicminerals in India since 1950. During the last thirty-six years a largevolume of geological, analytical, mineralogical and other relevant datahave been generated and documented in a systematic manner. These dataare presently available on manually operated files. This conventionalway of data handling though serves a limited purpose, is very slow forinformation retrieval and is highly inefficient for large data volumesand multiple users. An efficient way of handling information to matchthe speed of data generation and demand for quick information retrievalis through a computer using a data base approach. With this objectivein view, Indian Uranium Geological Data Base (INDUGEO) was designed onthe lines of INTURGEO 1. The System 332 Computer where the INDUGEO hasbeen implemented supports a network file structure. INDUGEO consistsof eleven files. A base with proper logical relationships and links hasbeen designed for easy access, quick retrieval and query. The Systemprovides sufficient flexibility to the application programmer to changethe view of the data to suit different applications. There is also provisionfor extending the data base to meet any future requirements. The Systemhas been made user friendly with HELP Commands to assist those who havelittle programming knowledge.
