 At the fast-paced MCI,which must squeeze every millisecond of performance out of DB2 and othercritical subsystems to get the job done, the performance group has broken themold.andM;The number of telephone calls made over an MCI network at least equals thenumber of transactions that MCI software is required to process.andP;  Each callproduces a call-detail record (CDR) that must be available for all billingsystems.andP;  Some CDRs may be copied 15 times for different systems.andM;FCC regulations require the information to be stored for a certain period.andO;MCI has approximately 4T bytes (one terabyte equals 1,000 gigabytes) of DASDstorage available.andP;  The volume of transactions at MCI may only be grasped bysoftware engineers in similar positions with ATandamp;T.andP;  To most data processingorganizations, the volume is mind-boggling.andM;In this transaction-oriented production environment, the software performanceengineers have attained a high status.andP;  They now oversee the development ofcritical software at every step of the life cycle.andP;  This software performanceoversight role could serve as a model for MIS organizations that must buildtransaction-oriented applications.andP;  It would especially apply to thoseorganizations building with DB2, which is extremely sensitive to the correctmatch of application design and the use of data.andM;Performance engineering has become proactive at MCI in the last 18 months,according to Gary Weisenborn, the director of customer systems development inArlington.andP;  In one case, the technical design of a highly complexworkstation-LAN server-IBM mainframe host application was changed, he said.andO;The result was the ability to accommodate 400 to 500 users, instead of theoriginally projected 30 users on a 3090 mainframe.andM;The performance group produced a model of the complete environment, includingall the interfaces to the underlying applications.andP;  &quot;It made a dramaticdifference in the design phase, before we even coded,&quot; Weisenborn said.andO;While the original design was to use strictly the DB2 database, the altereddesign used a mix of DB2 and several Vsam file types to improve efficiency,he said.andM;&quot;In the past, we would have been in system test before we realized atechnical redesign might give us better performance,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Now, we areglad to have the performance group involved in the design phase.&quot;andM;DESIGNING IN PERFORMANCEandM;The effort at MCI began in 1986, with Bob Gray, manager of computerperformance management, technical services, and Dave Halbig, senior managerof communications software and performance engineering.andP;  &quot;We tried toimplement performance improvements in subsystems that had been bad performerssince day one, or had become bad performers because the company had grown somuch,&quot; Halbig said.andM;In 10 years, MCI has grown to a $6.5 billion company.andP;  Billable callsnumbered 7.5 billion, up from 5.4 billion in 1984.andP;  Each is at least onetransaction.andP;  &quot;We have massive data processing concerns.andP;  Some of theseapplications were never architected to handle this explosive growth,&quot; saidHalbig.andM;The performance engineers have tried to persuade MCI's software developersthat performance must be designed into the application.andP;  A few earlysuccesses established the credibility of the emphasis on softwareengineering.andM;For example, using one crude model, Gray and Halbig projected that oneinternal cost-control application would have a 36- to 48-hour run time.andP;  Butthe available processing time was only seven hours.andP;  &quot;We got them toradically restructure what they were using,&quot; Halbig said.andM;Gray said, &quot;We asked them to go back and assess their data requirements.andO;Simply asking for everything that existed was not needed, when a subset wouldgive them the same result.andP;  The crude model showed them that the originalunbounded requirement was wildly unrealistic.&quot;andM;Unrealistic requirements sometimes come about when an executive goes intoconsiderable design detail without interacting with MIS.andM;Initial successes were followed by others.andP;  One DB2 subsystem was reduced byseven to 10 times the processing requirement per customer per month than wasthe design direction.andP;  &quot;The system had a prototype, and they had no sense ofwhat it would be like if they tried to scale it up to match marketingprojections,&quot; said Gray.andM;Management began lending more support to the performance engineers, and theirmethods became incorporated in MCI's Corporate System DevelopmentMethodology, the firm's own documented method for building software systems.andO;The method requires performance engineering sign-off points at every stage.andO;Changes proposed after a signoff must be cost-justified.andM;&quot;Now the confrontation is spread over many confrontations,&quot; said Gray.andO;&quot;We're seeing that as being very effective.&quot;andM;Halbig said, &quot;Our models are usually accurate within a 10% margin.andP;  Ourobjective is to help the development organization deliver a system theirusers are happy with.&quot;andM;Performance engineers must combine the skills of systems programmers andapplication developers.andM;Demographics are driving software performance engineering as well.andP;  DB2 makesit easier for programmers and users to get at data, and demand forexperienced DB2 programmers outstrips the supply.andP;  &quot;Our intent is to leverageour senior staff across a wider body of junior people,&quot; Gray explained.andM;The tools linking application development and performance engineering aretermed &quot;barely adequate&quot; by the MCI performance engineers.andP;  &quot;The vendorcommunity has a big opportunity,&quot; said Halbig.andM;MCI has experimented with the Telon code generator from Pansophic Systems,Inc., Lisle, Ill.andP;  &quot;It makes no attempt to ask you how often you execute anentity in a process,&quot; Gray said.andP;  &quot;We've found when you're dealing with alow-volume processing, the path you take to solve the problem is notcritical.&quot;andM;The company has also experimented with tools from Bachman InformationSystems, Burlington, Mass.andP;  Alphonse Rodriguez, senior software performanceengineer who teaches programming classes at MCI, said, &quot;If I was a new DB2user, I would want to use that tool.&quot;andP;  As an experienced user, he found thetool was time consuming to use.andM;Other tools MCI uses include DB Optimizer from Systems Center, Reston, Va.;andO;Insight DB2 from Goal Systems, Columbus, Ohio; and DASD management softwarefrom BMC, Sugar Land, Tex.andM;For modeling, Crystal from BGS, Waltham, Mass., and Paws, from Scientific andEngineering Software, Austin, Tex., are strong.andP;  &quot;Crystal has all thebenchmark work that BGS has done to get native path length,&quot; Gray said.andP;  &quot;Andthe Paws/GPSM [graphical programming of simulation models] model enables youto build a picture of the model.andP;  And it handles the complexities ofmultiplatform systems.&quot;andM;(Note: SES no longer sells Paws, which was written in Fortran; it has beensuperseded by SES/Workbench, which is written in C and C++.andP;  Paws users mustreconstruct their models to change to SES/Workbench.andP;  The company isproviding Paws support for a limited period.)andM;However, to make use of the models, &quot;You must have a good engineeringhandbook that says how much resource it says to perform the functions,&quot; Graysaid.andP;  While BGS has done the work to define the resource needed to make aDB2 call, &quot;Sometimes, a more fundamental building block is needed.&quot;andP;  MCI iscrafting these on its own; that's the hard part.andM;An enormous amount of labor is tied into doing the research to build thehandbook.andP;  For example, one MCI engineer invested months to understand thedocuments the algorithms involved in table lookups.andP;  &quot;Now that we understandthe algorithm, we can publish it in a book,&quot; said Halbig.andM;MCI incorporates relevant detailed performance information, whenever itbecomes available.andP;  The exact optimization done for the benchmark is alwaysnoted.andP;  &quot;If we can't find a benchmark and no one else has it, we'll do ourown benchmark and publish it in the handbook,&quot; Gray said.andM;A good opportunity for a tool supplier would be to provide a hybrid logicaland physical modeling package that could produce some pseudocode for asystem, Gray said.andP;  &quot;If I can't show them [the users] that much, they go makeother plans,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Unless you can provide feedback before they'vechosen an architecture, you're not going to change them.andP;  We want them toconsider options.&quot;andM;With the existing modeling tools, &quot;You're much farther along in the processby the time you're feeding information into the model than we would like tobe,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We need a first-cut model well before that.&quot;andM;Defining the bottom-line benefit is still another issue.andP;  Translatingimproved service levels into dollar values, and comparing the cost of thepath not taken, is difficult.andM;One success story involved an application for auditing the bills of MCIsuppliers.andP;  The cost-containment system was doing 22 audit runs per day.andO;With elaborate performance tuning over a six-month period, &quot;The audit runswent from 22 to over 200 per day,&quot; said Halbig.andP;  That recaptured $18 millionmore for MCI over a period of two months, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
