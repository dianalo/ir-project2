The bottom of the column includes an overflow      (3) and an outlet (5). The gas introduction pipe (7,8) empties above the      bottom (4) and below a sieve bottom (6) arranged in the column (1). A      packing material (10) rests on the sieve bottom (6), which packing (10)      essentially fills the absorption column (1). A cooling part (11) extends      from the absorption column (1). The cooling part (11) includes a cooling      zone (15) and a gas collection space (16) above it with a closable      connection piece (13). A pipe (14), which may include a serrated crown on      each end, runs from the gas collecting space (16) downward in a cooled      manner to the packing 10. The liquid absorption agent is introduced      through a lateral connection piece (18) into the gas collection space      (16). For the measurement of ammonia concentration, a certain volume flow      of the gas to be measured is washed in a countercurrent flow with the      absorption agent, and the NH.sub.3 content is determined in a part of the      ammonia containing absorption agent. The volume flow rate of the      absorption agent and of the gas from which NH.sub.3 has been removed is      measured (the latter being dried), and the ammonia concentration is      thereby calculated. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to a novel device for the continuous measurement of      the ammonia concentration (NH.sub.3) in gases, for example, flue gases, in      the ppm range. A method for the measurement of ammonia concentration is      also described, which method can be carried out with the device of this      invention. </PAR><PAR>  The quantitative determination of the ammonia concentration in a gaseous      media has become important due to the introduction of secondary measures      for the removal of nitrogen (i.e. denitrofication) from furnace systems.      In most instances, the process of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with      ammonia as the reducing agent is used for lowering the nitrogen oxide      content of the flue gases. The continuous measurement of ammonia content      is desirable for controlling such systems and for monitoring the      prescribed emission values of the gases. </PAR><PAR>  Devices for measuring the concentration of ammonia are currently known      which are based on various methods and principles and are suitable for      various measurement ranges. </PAR><PAR>  A distinction can be made between methods which detect the NH.sub.3      directly in the gaseous phase and those in which NH.sub.3 is chemically      bound and then determined in solution. Methods in which the NH.sub.3      concentration can be determined directly in the gaseous phase are usually      based on the photometry of the NH.sub.3 in the infrared (IR) range. In      these methods, the intensity of light (preferably infrared light) absorbed      in, transmitted by, or reflected from a gaseous sample may be      quantitatively measured and compared against a reference light intensity,      to thereby provide a quantitative measurement of ammonia concentration in      the gaseous sample. In these methods, specimen gas is removed from a      flue-gas line via a gas probe and conducted into a cuvette of a      photometer. The lowest measuring range of most of the commercially      available devices is in the range of about 0-300 ppm. </PAR><PAR>  The range between 0 and 10 ppm ammonia, which is, for example, downstream      of the catalyst and particularly interesting in the monitoring of denox      systems (i.e. systems for freeing flue gases from NO.sub.x, according to      Ernst), cannot be reliably determined by the devices and methods described      above. However, laser photometers have become commercially available      wherein NH.sub.3 concentrations around 1 ppm can be determined in situ.      However, these laser devices are extremely expensive, require a long      absorption stretch and exhibit high variations of errors. </PAR><PAR>  Another method for determining the NH.sub.3 concentration in a gaseous      phase is based on the combustion of the NH.sub.3 on a catalyst and then      measuring the heat of the reaction. This method is reliable only at higher      concentrations of NH.sub.3 and in the absence of further oxidizable      substances, for example, carbon monixide and hydrocarbons. </PAR><PAR>  Methods in which NH.sub.3 is chemically bound from the gaseous phase and      the concentration of NH.sub.3 then determined in solution are used more      frequently, since these methods are more sensitive. However, these methods      have the disadvantage of being more time-consuming and are usually      operated in a discontinuous manner. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, calorimetric methods are often used in which a quantitative      measurement of the light absorption of a dye material which arises in a      color reaction with NH.sub.3 and other reagents is used to determine      concentration of ammonia. </PAR><PAR>  Other frequently used methods for determining ammonia concentration are      ion-sensitive potentiometry and the conventional wet-chemical      determination of NH.sub.3 per acid-base titration after a Kjeldahl      distillation. However, these methods are also discontinuous and usually      require a considerable amount of time until the complete result of the      analysis is available. Other, less frequently used methods make use of the      photoionization of NH.sub.3 and/or the use of electrochemical sensors.      however, the desired measuring range between about 0 and 10 ppm ammonia      cannot be achieved by these methods. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention relates to a device and method for measuring the ammonia      concentration in a gaseous sample. By using this invention, very low      concentrations of ammonia may be measured. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further objective of this invention to provide a method and      apparatus for measuring ammonia concentration in a continuous manner. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus of the invention includes a columnar absorption vessel      wherein the ammonia containing gaseous sample is admitted near the bottom      of the absorption vessel. This ammonia containing gas meets a      counter-current flow of an absorbent liquid in a packed region of the      absorption vessel. The absorbent liquid enters the column near its top      end. The ammonia component of the gaseous sample is absorbed by the liquid      and collected at the bottom of the vessel. From the bottom of the vessel,      the liquid is pumped to an ammonia analyzer, and the content of ammonia in      the absorbent liquid component is determined in the ammonia analyzer. </PAR><PAR>  The ammonia free gas is removed from the top of the absorption vessel,      dried, and passed through a gas meter. The as meter measures the volume      flow rate of the gas passing through the column. </PAR><PAR>  The ammonia concentration in the gas sample may be determined based on the      measured concentration of ammonia in the absorbent liquid and the      volumetric flow rate of the ammonia free carrier gas. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention will be more fully described in the following detailed      description, especially when considered in view of the attached figures,      wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a sectional view of the columnar absorption vessel in      accordance with the invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows one arrangement of the columnar absorption vessel in      conjunction with a flue-gas conduit, a probe, and the other gas analyzing      equipment. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  In the FIGS., like reference numbers refer to same part throughout the      various views shown. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The columnar absorption vessel 1 and cooling fixture 11 in accordance with      the invention are shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  The subject invention as shown in FIG. 1 is constituted by a device for the      continuous measurement of the ammonia concentration in gases in the parts      per million (ppm) range. The device is characterized by a columnar      absorption vessel 1 with a bottom 4 which bulges out as a hemisphere with      an outlet piece 5 located at the lowest position in the column. An      overflow pipe 3 is located laterally immediately above the bottom 4. An      infeed pipe 7, 8 for the introduction of the gas whose concentration is to      be measured is located laterally above the bottom 4 and below a sieve      bottom 6 fastened in the vessel 1. The infeed pipe 7, 8 is bent upward in      the central portion of the vessel 1 (with respect to the cross-section of      the vessel) and is provided with a rinse line 9. Packing material 10 rests      on the sieve bottom 6 and essentially fills up vessel 1. A cooling fixture      11 (or cooling part) extends from the absorption vessel 1 in an upward      direction. The cooling part 11 includes a cooling zone 15, and a gas      collection chamber 16. Located over the gas collection chamber 16 is a      closable suction piece 13. A connection piece 18 for supplying the liquid      absorption agent laterally into space 16 is provided. An inner pipe 14,      which may be designed with a serrated crown on one or both of its ends,      runs through cooling zone 15, and extends with its mouth into the gas      collection chamber 16. The inner pipe 14 is tightly connected at its other      end beneath the cooling zone 15 to the jacket of cooling part 11. </PAR><PAR>  A preferred embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention      provides that absorption vessel 1 and the cooling part 11 are designed as      separate and individual pieces which can optionally be connected to one      another via ground-glass joints. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the invention includes a method for the continuous meausrement      of the ammonia concentration of gases in the ppm range which can be      carried out using the device described above. The method is characterized      in that a certain volumetric flow rate of the gas whose ammonia      concentration is to be measured is continuously brought into contact with      a countercurrent flow of a liquid absorption agent. At least a part of the      ammonia-charged absorption agent is quantitatively tested in an ammonia      analyzer for its NH.sub.3 concentration. The total volume flow of the      absorption agent and the volume flow of the gas freed of ammonia and dried      is measured, and the NH.sub.3 concentration calculated according to the      formula:      ##EQU1##      which: C.sub.NH.sub.3.sup.G represents the concentration of NH.sub.3 in      the gas (in ppm relative to dry); </PAR><PA1>  C.sub.NH3.sup.L represents the concentration of NH.sub.3 in the absorption      solution (g/dm.sup.3) </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.Abs represents the volume flow of the flowing absorption solution      (dm.sup.3 /h); </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.G represents the volume flow of the gas to be analyzed, drawn by      suction through the absorption vessel (dm.sup.3 /h) in a normal state      relative to dry; normal state refers to a pressure of 1 bar at 0.degree. C      or 273.15K); </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.M, NH3 represents the molar volume of gaseous ammonia (dm.sup.3 /mole      in a normal state); and </PA1><PA1>  M.sub.NH3 represents the molar mass of ammonia (g/mole). </PA1><PAR>  A preferred embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention is      shown in FIG. 1 and has the following design. All dimensions and materials      set forth in this specification are for illustrative purposes only and      should not be considered to limit the invention. Various modifications and      changes can be made and are deemed to be within the level of ordinary      skill in the art. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus includes a cylindrical columnar absorption vessel 1 made of      glass with an inner diameter of about 14.4 mm and a length of about 225      mm. The absorption column 1 carries a standard socket 2 (female tapered      joint; NS 29 according to DIN 12242, part 1) on its upper end. Vessel 1 is      equipped with a lateral overflow pipe 3 which extends horizontally from      the vessel 1 at first and then bends downward into an L-shape. The end of      the overflow pipe 3 is provided with a socket (NS 14) for the insertion of      a collector flask (not shown) for collecting the NH.sub.3 -containing      absorption agent whose ammonia content is not measured. The overflow pipe      3 is located above the bottom 4 of the vessel 1, which bottom 4 is bulged      out in a downward direction as a hemisphere. A discharge piece 5 for      removing the NH.sub.3 -charged absorbent liquid by suction, is attached at      the lowest point of the bottom 4. This absorbent liquid is later      analytically measured for ammonia content. </PAR><PAR>  A sieve bottom 6 with round perforations which are approximately 2 mm in      diameter is located approximately 170 mm below the standard socket 2.      Connection piece 7 for introducing the gas to be analyzed empties      readially into the bottom area of the glass cylinder which makes up the      absorption vessel 1, approximately 11 mm below the sieve bottom 6. Glass      pipe 8, which is bent up into an L-shape and terminates after a short      distance, forms the continuation of the connection piece 7 in the interior      of the glass cylinder. As a result of the arrangement of the glass pipe 8,      the gas to be analyzed is directed directly onto the bottom of the sieve      bottom 6. This prevents the drying out of the glass walls of the      absorption vessel by the test gas, which is typically at an elevated      temperature. </PAR><PAR>  A spherical ground-glass joint (for example, a ball-and-socket joint) is      fastened to the outer end of connection piece 7 at a distance of      approximately 24 mm from the jacket of the glass cylinder. Advantageously,      this ground glass joint and the other ground glass joints used in this      invention may be made from quartz glass. Sealants and/or lubricating      materials may be placed between the ground glass surfaces in the joint.      Such ground glass joints are well known to those skilled in the art and      are commercially available. </PAR><PAR>  An upwardly directed rinsing piece 9 is attached in the middle of      connection piece 7. Some wash liquid can be introduced through this      rinsing line 9 from time to time for rinsing (or washing) the gas entry      piece 7. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the wash fluid      introduced through the rinse line 9 is the same as the absorbent liquid      introduced in the top of the column. </PAR><PAR>  A packing 10, which may be constructed in the form of balls, rings, hollow      cylinders, or customary mixing and gas-exchange elements of ceramics,      glass or plastic, essentially fills column 1 above the sieve bottom 6 to      approximately the shoulder of socket 2. </PAR><PAR>  A cooling part 11 is set on the socket 2 of the absorption vessel 1. The      cooling part 11 is connected to the absorption column via cone 12 (male      tapered joint NS 29) which is attached to the socket 2. </PAR><PAR>  The cooling fixture 11 includes a partially double-walled cylindrical glass      tube with a diameter of 26 mm and a length of approximately 90 mm. The      glass tube terminates at the top in a one-way stopcock 13 which is      connected by a line to a gas suction pump 22 (see FIG. 2). The gas freed      of NH.sub.3 in the absorption vessel 1 passes upward through the cooling      fixture 11 from below and through an inner tube 14 with an inner diameter      of 8 mm. The inner tube 14 terminates in a gas collection space 16 located      above cooling zone 15. Inner tube 14 is preferably designed on both ends      as a serrated crown. </PAR><PAR>  Cooling zone 15 is designed like a Liebig condenser and equipped with a      customary cooling-agent guide 17. Liebig condensers are well known to      those skilled in the art and are commercially available. A connection      piece 18 for supplying absorption liquid empties laterally into the gas      collection space 16. The liquid runs over the upper serrated crown into      the inner pipe 14 and then drips over the lower serrated crown onto the      packing 10. The serrated crowns effect a loading of the packing 10 with      the absorption liquid in as uniform a manner as possible. The inner pipe      can be cooled, if necessary, through the double jacket with flowing water. </PAR><PAR>  A stationary NH.sub.3 concentration develops in the flowing wash liquid      during the operation of the device after a short start up time of a few      seconds. After the stationary NH.sub.3 concentration has been established      the NH.sub.3 concentration in the gas to be analyzed can be calculated      with the aid of the following formula:      ##EQU2##      in which: C.sub.NH3.sup.G andequals;concentration of NH.sub.3 in the gas (ppm      relative to dry); </PAR><PA1>  C.sub.NH3.sup.L andequals;concentration of NH.sub.3 in the absorption solution      (g/dm.sup.3); </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.Abs andequals;volume flow of the flowing absorption solution (dm.sup.3 /h); </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.g andequals;volume flow of the gas to be analyzed, drawn by suction through      the absorption vessel (dm.sup.3 /h in a normal state relative to dry); </PA1><PA1>  V.sub.M, NH3 andequals;molar volume of gaseous ammonia state (dm.sup.3 /mole in a      normal state); and </PA1><PA1>  M.sub.NH3 andequals;molar mass of ammonia (g/mole). </PA1><PAR>  In order to operate the NH.sub.3 analyzer, its base line is first adjusted      by drawing in fresh wash liquid by suction. Then, a calibration with an      exactly adjusted standard solution of NH.sub.4 Cl in wash liquid (as a      solvent) takes place. Then, the wash liquid collected at the bottom 4 of      the absorption vessel is removed by suction and the gas is passed to the      analyzer to be analyzed. After a constant value has been set on the      NH.sub.3  analyzer, the concentration is calculated according to the      formula given above. </PAR><PAR>  The procedure for using the apparatus in accordance with the invention for      the continuous determination of the ammonia concentration in gases in the      ppm range is explained below with reference to FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  The gas to be tested is drawn out of a flue gas conduit 30 and into the      absorption column 1 by suction with the aid of gas pump 22 through a probe      32 and a gas line. The volume flow removed by suction can be regulated      with a needle valve connected in a bypass to the gas pump 22. The      volumetric flow rate of the gas to be tested may be varied over a wide      range, for example in the case of the waste gas from a large industrial      furnace system, between 5 and 200 l/h. A preferred volumetric flow rate is      normally in the range of about 15-45 l/h. The gas removed by suction is      introduced via connection pieces 7, 8 provided with a spherical      groundglass joint into the absorption device. In the absorption device,      the gas flows from below through a glass column 1 with a packing 10 and is      brought into contact with a countercurrent flow of the absorption liquid      supplied from above onto the packing 10 for the absorption of the ammonia. </PAR><PAR>  Solutions of acids, such as H.sub.2 SO.sub.4, H.sub.3 BO.sub.3, or HCL, can      be used, for example, as 1 molar aqueous solutions, as the absorption      liquid. These solutions may also advantageously be used as the wash fluid      in rinse line 9 as discussed above. The volume flow of the absorption      liquid used in accordance with the above described system is in the range      of about 0.03 and 1.0 l/h, and preferably from about 0.1 to 0.5 l/h.      Again, these flow rates are for purposes of illustration and should not be      construed as limiting this invention. </PAR><PAR>  The absorption of the ammonia takes place in the following manner: </PAR><PAR>  The absorption liquid is pumped by hose pump 19a out of a storage vessel 20      and onto the packing 10 via connection piece 18. </PAR><PAR>  The liquid absorption agent drips through the packing 10, where it is      charged with the NH.sub.3 and falls onto the hemispherical bottom 4 of      absorption column 1, and is collected. From there, a portion of the      solution flows out of the column 1 through overflow 3. The other portion      of the solution is removed via suction by means of a hose pump 19b and is      pumped into an ammonia analyzer 21. The ammonia analyzer used in      accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention detects the      ammonia concentration based on the principle of the gaseous diffusion of      ammonia through a membrane with a subsequent conductometric determination      of the ammonia content. The ammonia analyzer is an electric conductivity      measuring device which includes a membrane located between two      compartments. On one side of the membrane, an absorption fluid, such as      ammonium hydroxide in boric acid, is present. Various amounts of ammonium      hydroxide and boric acid concentrations are used, depending on the ammonia      concentration to be measured. For example, from a 0-1 ppm measurement      range, 3 ml of 0.02M NH.sub.4 OH per liter of 0.1% boric acid may      advantageously be used. Likewise, for the range of 1-200 ppm ammonia, 5 ml      of 0.02M NH.sub.4 OH per liter of 1% boric acid may advantageously be      used. For the range of 1-1000 ppm ammonia, 15 ml of 0.02M NH.sub.4 OH per      liter of 3% boric acid may advantageously be used. </PAR><PAR>  On the other side of the membrane, a wash fluid including NH.sub.4 Cl is      present. At this side, in the neighborhood of the membrane, KOH is added,      thus developing NH.sub.3 from the NH.sub.4 Cl. NH.sub.3 diffuses through      the membrane into the absorber fluid contained in the first-mentioned      compartment. Thereby the conductivity of the absorption fluid is changed      and an electric potential difference (a peak) between that fluid and the      original absorption fluid is generated. This process is also used for      calibration, whereby the NH.sub.4 Cl-concentration in the second      compartment is raised in distinct subsequent steps. An ammonia analyzer of      the type described above is commercially available, such as the Wescan 360      from the firm Gamma Analysentechnik. This ammonia analyzer is used in the      preferred embodiment of the invention. Other types of ammonia analyzers      may be used without departing from the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The gas with the ammonia removed passes above the packing 10 through the      cooler 11, and passes out of the apparatus via stopcock 13 and through the      pump 22. The gas is then passed through a drying tower 23 filled with a      drying agent and finally passed into a gas meter 24.
