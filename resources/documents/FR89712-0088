Like other major commercial banks in Japan and the United States, Applicant,together with its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily operates as an internationalcommercial bank receiving deposits and making commercial loans. At March31, 1988, on a consolidated basis, approximately 51% of Applicant's totalassets were represented by loans (together with advances, leasing and otherreceivables), and approximately 74% of its total liabilities were deposits.During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1988, income from loans accountedfor approximately 54% of Applicant's total income, and interest paid ondeposits represented approximate 63% of Applicant's total expenses.2. Applicant is currently engaged in the conduct of a commercial bankingbusiness in Japan, which includes receiving deposits, making loans, discountingbills, investing in securities, conducting domestic money transfers andforeign exchange transactions and performing other related services suchas safekeeping, collections and issuing guaranties, acceptances and lettersof credit. At September 30, 1988, Applicant had 244 branch offices, 29sub-branches, 11 agencies, seven wholly-owned subsidiaries, and 11 associatedcompanies in Japan.3. Applicant ranks as the fourth largest commercial bank in the world interms of consolidated assets. At March 31, 1988, Applicant and its consolidatedsubsidiaries had worldwide assets of Y43,311 billion ($346 billion) andworldwide deposits equivalent to Y31,167 billion ($249 billion). Net incomefor the year ended March 31, 1988 was Y121 billion ($1.0 billion) and totalstockholders' equity was equivalent to Y1,028 billion ($8.2 billion) atthat date.4. Applicant, as a Japanese commercial bank with subsidiaries, agenciesand branches in the United States, is subject to a regulatory structurewhich is comparable to that imposed on United States banks. The Bankinglaw (Law No. 59 of 1981, as amended) (the ``Bank Law'') grants authorityto the Japanese Ministry of Finance (the ``MOF'') to supervise Japanesebanks. The MOF's supervision pursuant to the Bank Law requires Applicant,among other things, to file a detailed annual report concerning its affairs.Under the Bank Law, the MOF's supervisory control extends to numerous areas.Further, all Japanese banks maintain current accounts with The Bank ofJapan, the central bank of Japan, by which The Bank of Japan is entitledto supervise, examine and audit the banks.5. As a result of its operations in the United States, Applicant is subjectto the provisions of the International Banking Act of 1978, as amended(the ``IBA''), and to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended(the ``BHCA''). By virtue of its ownership of The Bank of California, N.A.,Applicant is a registered bank holding company under the BHCA. Applicantis also subject to the supervision, examination and regulatory authorityof the banking departments of each of the seven states in which Applicanthas a branch, agency or representative office.6. Applicant wishes to be able to look to the United States equity capitalmarkets as a source of funds. Applicant could raise equity capital in theUnited States in a public or private primary offering of equity securities(of any class or type which Applicant may at the time be authorized underJapanese law to issue), either directly or in the form of ADRs. Applicantalso wishes to be able to establish an ADR program with a listing on anational securities exchange.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. Approval of the application is necessary and appropriate in the publicinterest, because it would advance the goals of the IBA, give Applicantaccess to the United States capital markets and expand investment opportunitiesfor United States investors. Approval of the application would also beconsistent with the protection of investors because the existing regulatorystructure to which Applicant is subject affords sufficient protection forinvestors.2. The purposes of the 1940 Act were to curb abuses frequently perpetratedby a particular type of investment vehicle. United States banks were exemptedbecause they were already subject to an extensive regulatory structurethat afforded protection to investors and because their operations didnot give rise to the abuses sought to be prevented by the 1940 Act. Thesetwo basic reasons for an exemption are equally applicable here. A commercialbank such as Applicant is simply a different type of institution than aninvestment company. The two institutions differ in purpose, function, rolein the economy and applicable regulation. Applicant is primarily engagedin the business of commercial banking, not the business of an investmentcompany.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions</ITAG>Applicant agrees to the imposition of the following conditions if the requestedorder is granted:1. Any public offering in the United States of Securities will be madeonly pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933(``1933 Act''). Any such offering will be done on the basis of disclosuredocuments that are appropriate and customary for such registration, andin any event at least as comprehensive as those used in public offeringsof similar securities in the United States by foreign issuers.2. Any placement in the United States of Securities under circumstancesnot requiring registration under the 1933 Act will meet the prevailingstandards for exemption from registration under the 1933 Act. Applicantwill not effect any such placement without obtaining an opinion of UnitedStates counsel that the placement is exempt from the registration requirementsof the 1933 Act or the statement of the staff of the SEC that it wouldnot recommend that the SEC take any action under the 1933 Act if such Securitiesare not registered. Any such placement will be done on the basis of disclosuredocuments that are appropriate and customary for such placement, and inany event at least as comprehensive as those used in placements of similarsecurities in the United States by foreign issuers.3. In connection with any offering or placement of Securities in the UnitedStates, Applicant agrees that it will expressly submit itself to the jurisdictionof any state or federal court in the City and State of New York in respectof any action abased on such Securities. Applicant further agrees to appointan agent located in the City and State of New York (which may be Applicant'sNew York branch) to accept any process which may be served in any action.Such consent to jurisdiction will be irrevocable as long as such Securitiesremain outstanding. Applicant agrees that, as long as such Securities remainoutstanding, it will appoint a successor agent for service if the agentfirst appointed is discharged or is unwilling or unable to continue toserve as agent for service.
