Using this estimatedexternal system, two methods to predict the generator step-out were developed.One is the application of the equal area criterion and another is thepredictive simulation method using the initial state variables duringgenerator swing. The developed logic and methods were verified by simulationof fundamental one machine to infinite bus system and also other systemsincluding the nonlinear load and the midway generator. As an example,fllowing results were obtained in the case of the system including themidway generator; the predictive function to judge the system stabilitywas very high, quantative index for the system stability was obtained,step-out judgment on the n-wave was accurate. Consequently, this developedlogic on step-out prediction was confirmed its effectiveness. (17 figs,2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
