Improvements have been made in the detector collimator to improvethe ability to discriminate between gas and deposit in the header pipes.The new detector collimator has been characterized for pipes having innerdiameters of 4.45 and 10.16 cm. A statistical analysis indicates thatthis new design is well suited to the smaller diameter pipe.</TEXT></DOC>
