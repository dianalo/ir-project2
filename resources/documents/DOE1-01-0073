Exposure to BDinduced in bone marrow: 1) a significant increase in the frequency ofchromosomal aberrations (CA); 2) a significant elevation in the frequencyof sister chromatid exchanges (SCE); 3) a significant lengthening ofthe average generation time (AGT); 4) a significant depression in themitotic index (MI): and, as measured in the peripheral blood, 5) a significantincrease in the proportion of circulating polychromatic erythrocytes(% PCE), and 6) a significant increase in the level of micronucleatedPCE (MN-PCE) and micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (MN-NCE).The most sensitive indicator of genotoxic damage was the frequency ofSCE, followed by MN-PCE levels, and then by CA and MN-NCE frequencies.The most sensitive measure of cytotoxic damage was AGT followed by %PCE and then my MI. The extent of concordance ranged from a very goodcorrelation between the induction of MN-PCE and the induction of SCEto the lack of a significant correlation between the depression in theMI and any other endpoint.</TEXT></DOC>
