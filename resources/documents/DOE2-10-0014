Thispermits the determination of the outdoor air quantity required to maintaina fixed indoor concentration of carbon dioxide. To maintain the recommendedthreshold limit value (TLV) of 2,500 ppM of outdoor air per person arerequired. Measurements of the carbon dioxide concentration in schoolswith reduced quantities of outdoor air showed that it remained at levelsbelow the TLV or exceeded it for only short periods. Similar measurementsin an office building and eight energy efficient houses showed the sameresults. There appears no need to consider CO/sub 2/ as a serious pollutantin buildings. Carbon dioxide has been used as an indicator of indoorair quality. Sensing its concentration permits minimizing the outdoorair required for contaminant dilution and hence the energy requirementfor its conditioning. The CO/sub 2/ level was used to modulate the outdoorand bypass dampers in an energy efficient Helsinki office building at70 to 800 ppM. Energy savings were reported as 40%. In the USA, a smallschool had a numer of CO/sub 2/ sensing points installed and the concentrationwas maintained in the range of from 1,000 to 2,000 ppM. A computer studypredicted an energy saving of 20% using the system. Both control systemswere removed after the tests so further development appears to be needed.There is some doubt as to whether CO/sub 2/ is a satisfactory measureof indoor pollution as other indoor pollutants could dominate in somesituations. 17 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
