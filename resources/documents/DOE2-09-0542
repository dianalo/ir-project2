<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0542 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ten excised lumbar spine segments were measured in vitro with a conventionalclinical rectilinear dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) system that usesa Gd-153 source as the source of dual energy photons. These segmentswere also measured using the Hologic QDR-1000 DPA system. The QDR-1000uses an x-ray tube as the source of dual energy photons. DPA measurementswere made in both frontal and lateral projections. The compressive strengthof the individual vertebral bodies was determined using conventionalmechanical testing techniques. All vertebral bodies were analyzed forwater and fat content and subsequently ashed to determine bone mineralcontent. The various correlations and relationships between the measuredparameters are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
