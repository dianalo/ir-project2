But that doesn't mean they are foreverybody.   Before investing in one, investors should answer thefollowing questions:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Can you lock the money up for at least 10 years?   Most annuity contracts have surrender penalties that cancut off a hefty chunk of principal if money is taken out toosoon. For example, take Equitable Life Assurance Society ofthe U.S.'s EquiVest, one of the largest variable annuitiesavailable to individual investors. It takes 6% of the moneyin the contract if an investor decides to pull out during thefirst five years, 5% if the withdrawal is made in years sixthrough eight, and 4% in year nine. The penalty phases out byyear 12.   Another reason variable annuities are appropriate only forlong-term investors is that it takes years for the taxdeferral to offset the high contract charges. &quot;An annuity'sannual contract charges will offset or exceed thetax-deferral benefits within the first 10 years,&quot; says StevenWeinstein, a partner at accounting firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.   People who will need their money in less than 10 yearswould be better off in mutual funds, he says.                                                                                                          Will you be at least 59 1/2 years old when you start tomake withdrawals?   Annuities, like all tax-deferred retirement vehicles,including IRAs, have restrictions on early withdrawals.Earnings on money taken out before age 59 1/2 are generallysubject to a 10% federal tax penalty. There is one exception:If a person under 59 1/2 elects to &quot;annuitize&quot; (that is,agrees to have the money accumulated in the annuity paid outin equal monthly payments for a certain number of years, oruntil the investor dies), the 10% penalty doesn't apply.                                                                                                          Are lower-cost alternatives available?   Other vehicles for tax-deferred investing may be moreattractive than variable annuities, particularly those thatallow you to invest pretax dollars. Among the possibilities:401(k) retirement plans offered by a growing number ofemployers, other types of company retirements plans, IRAs forthose who can deduct the contribution and Keogh retirementplans for people with income from self-employment.   &quot;These alternatives not only defer taxes on earnings, butthey defer taxes on income that's contributed to them,&quot; saysMr. Weinstein.                                                                                                          Do you want retirement income?   People often use variable annuities simply as atax-deferred investment vehicle.   Typically, they liquidate the contract after age 59 1/2,and pay taxes on the earnings.   But others use variable annuities to provide a steadystream of income when they retire. Investors who plan to dothis need to be especially careful when selecting an annuityto scrutinize the safety of the life insurance company thatunderwrites the contract.   During the accumulation phase, investors have no exposureto the life insurance company, since the funds are held inseparate accounts that aren't subject to general claims bycreditors of the life insurance company. But when peopleannuitize, their money generally goes into the insurancecompany's pool of assets. While you are getting the company'spromise to pay you back, that promise might be jeopardized ifthe insurer runs into severe financial difficulties and istaken over by regulators -- as has happened with severalinsurers this year.</TEXT></DOC>
