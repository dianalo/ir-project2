Just walk into any hole in the wall like the Maison Bourbon and buy an expensive drink like a $6 mint julep. Before you know it, some veteran musician like Wallace Davenport, who used to play with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra among others and was musical director for Ray Charles, strolls out and blows his sizzling trumpet right into your ear. Deprived indeed is the visitor to New Orleans who misses such an experience. Might as well skip the blackened redfish.    Yet as the natives frequently point out, traditional jazz is only a small part of the New Orleans music scene. Pick up a copy of the Times-Picayune's weekly leisure supplement, Lagniappe; the weekly alternative newspaper Gambit; or the monthly music paper Wavelength and you'll see scores of listings for every night of the week: modern jazz, gospel, blues, rock, rhythm andamp; blues, Cajun, zydeco, Afro-Caribbean, or any combination in some unclassifiable but always seething jam session. An astonishing number of musicians from the past four decades of American popular music grew up in New Orleans and have never left; others gravitate there because they crave the stimulation of playing and listening to one another. Fortunately for the rest of us, most of this stimulation takes place in public.    But it's not really geared toward the public, by which I mean tourists. Every April, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, thousands of out-of-towners converge on the city's spacious fairgrounds for six days of live performances by hundreds of local and national musical legends. The fans leave behind oceans of good feeling and mountains of rubbish. But perhaps because they come mostly from adjoining Southern states, their annual influx doesn't translate into a steady, music-oriented tourist trade. A week after the &quot;Jazzfest,&quot; the tourists are back juleping on Bourbon Street and the locals are back jamming at Benny's.    Is this such a bad thing? Yes, according to Jan Ramsey, a real estate consultant who is also president of the New Orleans Music and Entertainment Association (NOME). Ms. Ramsey is a New Orleans native and self-confessed &quot;music freak&quot; who founded NOME in 1985, along with another &quot;Young Turk&quot; on the Economic Development Committee of the Chamber of Commerce. NOME members feel that the musical riches of the city ought to translate more directly into economic growth. Describing the &quot;oil and gas obsession&quot; of the investment community, Ms. Ramsey says that even if those currently sluggish industries were to revive, the area's economy would still need to diversify. &quot;New Orleans music,&quot; she adds, &quot;is an untapped gold mine.&quot;    NOME, which Ms. Ramsey describes as &quot;a business advocacy group, not another cultural organization,&quot; has a board comprising talent managers, booking agents, club owners, an entertainment attorney, an aide from the mayor's office, the publisher of Wavelength, and Cosimo Matassa, one of a handful of studio owners who produced a string of national hits during the heyday of Randamp;B in the '50s and '60s. The group's short-term goal is to forge a closer link between music and tourism, especially during the summer months, when the slack convention trade leaves many hotel rooms vacant.    Sounds great, but who in his right mind would go to New Orleans in the sweltering summer, even to hear Fats Domino, Irma Thomas, Earl &quot;Trick Bag&quot; King, Johnny Adams, Beausoleil, the Neville Brothers, the Radiators, Alvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler, Allen Toussaint, the Wild Magnolias, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Etta James, Buckwheat Zydeco, Wynton or Branford or Delfeayo Marsalis, Ernie K-Doe, Dr. John, Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry, Walter Washington, the Donald Harrison/Terence Blanchard Quintet, or the Reverend Paul S. Morton andamp; the Greater St. Stephen's Baptist Church Choir?    &quot;Europeans,&quot; says Ms. Ramsey, who points out that New Orleans recordings sell briskly overseas -- as do those few artists who can be persuaded to tour. If we can export the music, NOME asks, why can't we import the fans? Line up direct flights (at the moment there are none), house groups in air-conditioned hotels, feed them crawfish &quot;etouffee,&quot; and guide them from nightspot to nightspot till they're jumping like the natives. The first package, tentatively slated for next summer, would involve a tour group from music-minded Liverpool.    Natives seem less skeptical toward this short-term goal of NOME's than toward its long-term hopes that music-oriented tourism will encourage investment in a locally based music industry, complete with support services on the scale of, say, Nashville. John Berthelot, owner of a small local label, Great Southern Records, questions NOME's &quot;pie-in-the-sky&quot; belief that New Orleans music could sustain even one national record label, because &quot;There's just not enough of it.&quot; As Motown had to move from Detroit to Los Angeles, he says, so would a New Orleans-based company have to branch out and &quot;take anything that's going to sell.&quot;    Jason Patterson, the proprietor of Snug Harbor, a modern-jazz club, is not a native but shares the native zest for music: &quot;Culturally this area is extremely rich and spicy, and it's been that way forever. It's a pulse. There's something happening here that isolates it to some extent, but which also nurtures its unique properties.&quot; Yet Mr. Patterson too has doubts about competing on the national scene: &quot;If I were doing a big promo thing for New Orleans, then I might say, yeah, it could happen. But frankly, I don't see what singles out New Orleans as opposed to any other music scene as far as the current pop culture goes.&quot;    Another problem is that, along with their vigorous musical tradition, many local musicians also share doubts about the motives and integrity of people in the music business. Mr. Patterson says these doubts are justified: &quot;There's a history of past exploitation, and dues still have to be paid.&quot; He encourages NOME to &quot;prove itself&quot; by offering &quot;up-front, high-profile&quot; help in legal and business matters, because &quot;the younger musicians suspect NOME of wanting to use, not support, them, and the older ones are skeptical. So many organizations have come and gone.&quot;    To all these qualms, NOME's reply seems to be: How will we know till we try? Ms. Ramsey and the publisher of Wavelength are negotiating the Liverpool tour package and discussing plans to make Wavelength more accessible to tourists. Mr. Patterson is trying to win the confidence of the music community by producing a music-business news service on WWOZ-FM, the local station for New Orleans music. Mark Davis, NOME's entertainment attorney, places ads urging musicians to obtain legal advice before, not after, they sign a contract. Mr. Davis and Mr. Matassa are seeking investors to start a manufacturing plant for compact disk masters.    And the bands jam. If once again the musical wealth of New Orleans starts selling, will the benefits flow in or out of the city? Can New Orleans become a leader again, or is it doomed to be an especially lively museum? Mr. Berthelot, who in addition to running his record company teaches instrumental music in the public schools, reflects on his young students' taste for MTV and rap music: &quot;For kids, the national culture is much stronger. But usually when they get older, they turn back to the local culture. That's one of the advantages of New Orleans. When people get turned off to the national culture, they can always come back to what's here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
