Roth Jr.was favored to capture a fourth term despite a spirited challengefrom Democratic Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo.   In the presidential race, Vice President George Bush was expectedto defeat Democrat Michael Dukakis easily and claim Delaware's threeelectoral votes.   The one bright spot for Democrats appeared to be the race for thestate's lone congressional seat, where Rep. Thomas R. Carper waswidely favored over Republican challenger James P. Krapf.   Woo, the nation's highest-ranking elected official of Chinesedescent, narrowly won a Democratic primary in September, defeatingcivic activist Samuel Beard by 71 votes.
