That regulation established anew appointing authority in the excepted service made pursuant to ScheduleB authority at 5 CFR 213.3202(1). Following the receipt of comments frominterested members of the public, the final rule was published on August31, 1982 (47 FR 38257). The regulation provided for the filling of professionaland administrative career (PAC) positions at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels duringthe period when the Office of Personnel Management did not have a registerof competitive eligibles to fill vacancies in those occupations. The newSchedule B authority applied only when agencies used external recruitingand hiring procedures to fill such positions. Since that time, one unionhas challenged the absence of competitive, job-specific examinations forall of the approximately 118 PAC occupations which were formerly examinedunder the PACE and which were subject to the Schedule B authority. TheUnited States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (<T3>NTEU </T3>v. <T3>Horner, </T3>Nos. 87-5102 andamp; 87-5191) and the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 84-2573) have directedthat OPM conduct a notice and comment rulemaking proceeding in order tosupplement the rulemaking record which was developed in 1982 to includethe publication of the cost data upon which OPM relied in making its decisionin 1982 to permit agencies to use Schedule B in those occupations wherealternative examinations had not been developed. The reasons, based onvarious cost factors, for OPM's decision not to develop examinations inall of the PAC occupations are stated below under ``Supplementary Information.''The purpose of this publication of the proposed rule is to provide an opportunityfor comment by interested members of the public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before February 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments may be sent to Donald L.

Green, Associate GeneralCounsel, Office of General Counsel, (202) 632-5087.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Pursuant to the terms of a consentdecree which was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District ofColumbia on  November 18, 1981 (<T3>Luevano </T3>v. <T3>Devine, </T3>Civil Action No. 79-271), OPM agreed to eliminate theProfessional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE), a general abilitiestest, and the register of eligibles derived therefrom and to replace thatexamination with job-specific, alternative examinations for approximately118 job series. Those jobs are in Professional and Administrative Career(PAC) occupations at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels.OPM considered a number of factors relating to cost when it arrived atits decision to permit agencies to use a Schedule B authority until OPMcould develop alternative examinations to replace the PACE. In 1981, OPManticipated little outside hiring due to a government-wide, employmentfreeze which had been imposed by the President of the United States. Reductions-in-force(RIGs), due to severe budget reductions, were also declared and conductedat that time and in 1982. For those reasons, cost considerations were aprominent feature in OMP's cost-analysis in determining when and for whichoccupations new competitive examinations should be developed.The emphasis in 1981 and 1982 was in placement of Federal employees whohad been the subject of RIFs into any upcoming Federal vacancies. Thatwas accomplished through programs such as the Displaced Employees Program(DEP) and the Voluntary Inter-Agency Placement Program (VIPP) whereverpossible. Thus, in 1982, OPM anticipated that there would be substantiallyreduced external hiring in most Federal occupations, including those whichhad been formerly filled through the use of the PACE. It was believed thatmost hiring in the PACE occupations would be accomplished through internalmeans, including promotions, transfers, and reassignments, and that fewagencies would use Schedule B to hire from external sources.In arriving at its decision to develop examinations in only those occupationswhere the Federal government had the largest number of vacancies insteadof examining in all the approximately 118 occupations, OPM considered anumber of factors. Among those were historical trends based on the annualnumber of hires from the PACE register in each occupation over a six-yearperiod (1975 to 1981), the overall hiring figures and anticipated hiringtrends throughout the Federal government in all occupations, the actualcost for development and implementation of the PACE which were based onOPM's previous experience with the PACE, and the legislative budget allocatedfor examination development.Between 1975 and 1981, the annual hiring figures from the PACE registerappeared to be steadily declining. For example, in FY 1978, over 7,000applicants had been selected from the PACE register. By FY 1980, however,selections had decreased to 4,674. Based on the hiring freeze mandatedby the President in 1981, OPM anticipated hiring less than 2,000 employeesper year after 1982 into all of the PAC occupations. In 1983, externalhiring through Schedule B amounted to 2,059, and, in 1984, it increasedto 4,020. The unexpected increase was due to a subsequent Presidentialemphasis on hiring at the Department of Defense and the Department of theTreasury.Known costs for PACE research and development amounted to $320,000 plusan additional $800,000 for four criterion-related validation studies, allrelated to the single PACE examination. Those costs were expended for thePACE between 1973 and 1975. In other words, during that period, OPM spentapproximately $1.2 million on the development of the single PACE examination.Based on the developmental costs for the PACE, OPM estimated in 1981 thatit would have to allocate at least $5 million over a four-year period (1982-1985)to develop job-specific examinations for seven of the large-fill occupationswhich had been covered by the PACE. That figure took into account an averagecost of $520,000 per examination in 1973 to 1975 dollars which had to beaugmented by inflation. Thus, it was anticipated that a single examinationwould cost somewhere between $550,000 to $800,000 to develop, dependingupon the nature of the examination required by that specific occupation.Start-up costs alone for the development of examinations for those sevenoccupations were estimated to be $1.5 million out of the $5 million projectedexpenditure. Actual start-up costs amounted to $1.8 million. The Office of Personnel Research and Development (OPRD) at the Office ofPersonnel Management was responsible for the development of competitiveexaminations. OPM's total operating budget for the OPRD was $855,249 inFY 1981 and $962,623 in FY 1982. Although, on average, approximately one-thirdof the budget of OPRD has been devoted since 1981 to the development ofalternative examinations for the PAC occupations, it could not possiblyhave absorbed the enormous costs which would have been required to developand implement 100 examinations. Furthermore, in 1981, OPM knew that theOPRD staff would be reduced by 50% early in 1982 as a result of the reduction-in-forceat the OPM. All programs, including the effort to develop alternative examinations,suffered by those reductions. Thus, the decision was made to use Schedule B as an appointing authoritywhile OPM initially pursued the development of competitive alternativesin those seven occupations which historically had the largest number ofhires and for which OPM anticipated significant hiring would continue.OPM concentrated its limited resources on seven occupations which, in conjunctionwith the competitive examinations which had been developed prior to November1981 in nine other former PACE occupations, accounted for 55% to 60% ofall hires in the PAC occupations. The remaining 100 occupations historicallyhave accounted for no more than 40% to 45% of all such hires. In the three year period between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1985,of the 108 occupations for which no competitive alternatives had been developed,eighty-seven of those occupations had an annual average of 20 or fewerexternal PAC hires under Schedule B throughout the Federal government.Of those eighty-seven occupations, forty occupations had no external PAChires under Schedule B during that three year period. Seven occupationshad an annual average of between 21 to 50 total external PAC hires throughoutthe Federal government during that entire period. Six occupations had anannual average of between 51 to 100 total external PAC hires; three occupationshad an annual average of between 101 to 200 total external PAC hires; andonly five occupations had over 200 total external PAC hires during allof that same period in all Federal agencies. Of those five occupations,four are now covered by a new competitive examination and the fifth isscheduled to be in the next group for examination development. Those figures must be compared with the total number of all PAC selectionsand the total number of employees in the Federal workforce at that time.The average total for external PAC hires under Schedule B during that threeyear period amounted to only 3,396 out of an average total of 15,280 forall PAC selections and represented only a small fraction of the total Federalworkforce which, between 1983 and 1985, averaged 2.25 million employees,excluding postal workers. OPM estimated, in 1981, that it would have cost approximately $71.4 millionto develop examinations (excluding operational costs) in the remaining100 occupations where OPM had traditionally done little hiring from thePACE register. That cost projection, too, was based on prior PACE expenditures.OPM had neither the financial nor staff resources to commit those expenditures.The following represent OPM's actual costs for test development betweenFY 1981 and FY 1987 for seven PAC occupations: Computer Specialist ($742,900);Tax Technician ($744,400); Internal Revenue Officer ($547,300); CustomsInspector ($554,200); Contract Specialist ($1,038,550), and Social InsuranceClaims Examiner and Social Insurance Representative ($884,100). Additionaloperating costs during this same period range from $100,000 to $300,000for each examination. Accordingly, total costs actually expended by OPMfor development and implementation for competitive examinations in thoseseven occupations amounted to $5,461,450 between FY 1981 and FY 1987. It is the intention of OPM to re-adopt its final rule previously adoptedby OPM on August 31, 1982 (47 FR 38257), as amended on July 6, 1987 (52FR 25193). OPM intends to continue to seek the appropriate means of examiningso that examination development is accomplished on an overall cost-productivebasis. OPM will continue to permit Federal agencies to utilize ScheduleB as an appointing authority while it develops competitive examinationsfor the remaining PAC occupations. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities becasue it pertains solely toprocedures for appointment of employees by Federal agencies. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 213 </ITAG>Government employees. <ITAG tagnum="20">Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is republishing its final regulation under 5 CFR Part213, originally published on August 31, 1982 (47 FR 38257) and amendedon July 6, 1987 (52 FR 25193), as a proposed regulation with opportunityfor comments, as set forth below: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE </ITAG>1.
