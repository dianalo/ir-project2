<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-26-0922 </DOCNO><TEXT>Analytical methods are presented for rig-site monitoring of oil muds forsmall amounts of &quot;active&quot; sulfides (such as the neutralization productsof lime and H/sub 2/S) and for small changes in water content. Applicationsof the two methods on Exxon wells are discussed. The sulfide method isa modification of the API Garrett Gas Train procedure adapted to testa sample of whole oil mud. The new water-content method is a modificationof the conventional retort method using a necked-down, precision-calibrated(Kolmer) centrifuge tube as the retort liquid receiver. Additionally,an effective, high-zinc-content, sulfide-scavenging chemical, ZnO, isdiscussed for use in oil muds as an additive for converting active sulfidesinto a more inert form, ZnS.</TEXT></DOC>
