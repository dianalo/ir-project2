Genetic algorithms appear to be particularly well-suited for problemswith multimodal search spaces. Although genetic algorithms have a significantamount of inherent parallelism, earlier work has tended to focus on sequentialimplementations. This paper describes a first step toward the developmentof genetic algorithms implementations for hypercube multiprocessors.Two basic algorithm organizations are discussed: a single parallel geneticalgorithm in a master-slave configuration and multiple sequential geneticalgorithms cooperating in an asynchronous fashion. Testing is neededto determine the relative merits and areas of applicability of each approach.</TEXT></DOC>
