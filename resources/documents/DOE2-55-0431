The results are an important part of the Bavarianland register. The natural contents of the elements are used as a basisfor the evaluation of anthropogenic additional loads. The base materialsof pedogenesis are solid rock in the underground as well as surface layerswhich are widely spread in Bavaria. With the knowledge of the materialof the surface layers and the geological underground it is possible toforecast the natural heavy metal distribution in soil profiles. The basiccontents of heavy metals in the soils increase with the contents of clayminerals and micas (concerns all analyzed elements), heavy minerals (Cr,Ni, Co, Zn), kalifeldspars (Pb), oxihydroxides of Al, Fe and Mn (Cr,Ni, Zn, Co) and in some cases even with the contents of plagioclases(Co, Cu). Quartz and carbonates (exception - Cd and Mn) dilute the contents.The relative immission load of a region can be determined with the aidof the forest humus layers, if the material stocks and pH values arecomparable in the rooted mineral soil horizons below. Nearly all contentsof lead (60 mg/kg) and cadmium (0.5 mg/kg) as well as a part of the contentsof zinc (55 mg/kg) and copper (15 mg/kg) in the forest layers of thetertiary hill country in South Bavaria result from immission, thoughthe area is far away from industry.
