Pre-tax-revision shelters pose problems: Most have used up -- burned out -- their loss deductions, or nearly. Deductibility against salary income is being phased down to 20% of these passive losses in 1989, 10% in 1990, and none thereafter; the loss balance can offset only passive income. And while burned-out deals have no sale value, they now produce taxable phantom, or cashless, passive income and create phantom capital gains upon disposition, even if given away.    Shelter investors no longer offset phantom gains with new shelters. So now investors may be tempted to dump burned-out shelters and to wash away the phantom gains with the last losses of other shelters. But that could be a mistake, says Warren Shine of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs: You avoid more tax by deducting all the losses against salary that the phase-out allows. And lacking offsetting losses, it's best to avoid triggering tax on phantom gains indefinitely.    Why? Because the dollar's value falls with time -- and many people foresee a lower capital-gains tax rate.    STOCK-OPTION LOSSES, newly freed from wash-sale rules, may be recaptured.    On Sept. 29, the Tax Court held that an investor in call options, which confer the right but not the obligation to buy stock at fixed prices, isn't subject to wash-sale restrictions. Those rules deny the deduction of losses on sales of stock or securities if the investor buys identical securities within 30 days before or after the sale date. Right away, Senate tax writers put a section in the tax bill since adopted by the Senate that would extend the wash-sale rules to sales of options after enactment.    The provision isn't in the House-passed bill. Indeed, the two houses may yet fail to agree on a tax bill in 1988. But when details are ironed out, observers say, the House may well accept the wash-sale clause for the Senate tax writers' reasons: a belief that options should be treated the same as stock and other securities, and a desire for another provision that can be presented as a revenue raiser.    SOME WIN, SOME LOSE when firms switch pension plans as Merrill Lynch did.    As many employers are, the big broker is ending a defined-benefit plan that provided pensions based on salary and years of service. Defined benefits have become costlier to administer because of new tax and accounting rules. And employees tend to see a pension years away as less valuable than a payment here and now. All of this has led more firms to adopt defined-contribution plans in which salary and service determine annual payments to an employee's account.    Now Merrill will adopt a defined-contribution plan -- and not to all employees' advantage. The biggest chunk of defined benefits was earned in the last 10 years of service, so older employees lose more than younger ones paid the same salaries, says Susan Velleman of Mercer-Meidinger, benefits consultants. &quot;People in their 50s and up particularly end up losing benefits they expected to have at retirement.&quot;    The change lets Merrill move, tax-free, a $220 million pension surplus to an employee stock ownership plan.    WALL-STREET BONUSES are the target of a crackdown by New York state. Because thousands of brokers and others aren't filing state returns showing bonuses and commissions, New York will raise its general withholding-tax rate on such income to the maximum 7.875% from 5%.    IRA CONTRIBUTIONS must be made in cash, under the tax code. But now IRS private ruling 8837034 says that a telephone order placed through a broker for an individual-retirement-account investment in a mutual fund will be treated as a cash payment, on certain conditions.    WRITING A WILL? The IRS, reversing a policy, says it will take requests from people who have written wills, or plan to, for private rulings on uncertain estate-tax issues. Revenue Procedure 88-50 initiates a test rulings program through 1989.    FAILURE TO CHANGE a pre-1981 will trims a tax-free bequest to this husband.    The 1981 tax act made a big estate-tax change for spouses: It lets them leave each other unlimited sums tax-free. Before, the maximum exempt bequest, by formula, was $250,000 -- and that law stands for deaths after 1981 if the wills were made before Sept. 12, 1981, and not revised afterward. Pauline Christmas of Raton, N.M., died in 1982 with a gross estate of $318,294. Her unamended 1977 will left the &quot;maximum&quot; sum available under the old law to her husband.    The IRS figured the bequest under old law. But husband Ace Christmas claimed the unlimited amount. He said his wife meant to incur the least possible tax; as evidence, he cited regular gifts of assets to their children over the years. But Judge Scott refused to &quot;wander outside the confines&quot; of the will's express language to try to determine the deceased wife's intent. To do so might cause a larger bequest than she intended, the judge said.    The maximum tax-free bequest to the husband must be figured under the old law, Judge Scott said.    BRIEFS: The IRS plans to issue today a long-awaited study of rules on U.S. companies' pricing of intangibles, such as patents, transferred to foreign affiliates; a conference on the study will be held at Georgetown University next week. . . . If all 35,875 people whose 1986 income topped $1 million had been taxed at 100%, the Tax Foundation says, the revenue rise would have run the government for only 12 days. </TEXT></DOC>
