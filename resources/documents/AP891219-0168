FBI agent William Hinshaw in Atlanta said the NAACP's southeastregional headquarters in Atlanta has been warned that the bombsappeared to be related to a Aug. 22 tear-gas mail bomb thatexploded there, injuring eight people.   In Montgomery, Ala., U.S. Marshal Jim Hudson said a federaljudge received a telephone death threat early Tuesday. He would notidentify the judge.   Police in Birmingham rushed Tuesday to investigate a packagemailed to Councilman David Herring, a longtime friend of Vance. Itturned out to be a delivery from an Atlanta business.   Meanwhile, a government source in Washington said the bomb thatkilled Vance bore the return address of Lewis F. Morgan, a senior11th Circuit judge in Georgia. Morgan is not a suspect, the sourcesaid, but the discovery means the killer knew a great deal aboutVance's personal habits and friendships.   Links between Vance and Robinson are not readily apparent, otherthan their moderate-to-progressive politics. Vance, who was white,became known as a racially progressive Alabama Democratic leaderbefore being elevated to the federal bench, while Robinson wasknown as a ``moderate, reasonable'' attorney and politician inSavannah.   One of Robinson's biggest cases as a lawyer did go before theappeals court. He helped represent a black group fightingdesegregation plans by the Savannah-Chatham County schools, whichwere approved by the 11th Circuit Court this fall.   But Vance was not among the three 11th Circuit judges ruling onthe case.   ``It was a case that we lost _ it wasn't like Robinson couldhave been accused of doing anything to upset the community,'' saidLowell Johnston, the lead attorney from the NAACP Legal DefenseFund who worked the case with Robinson.   Earlier this year, the Jacksonville NAACP won from the 11thCircuit a unanimous decision reinstating school busing inJacksonville, overruling a lower court judge who had declared theschool system was integrated. Vance wrote the opinion in that case.   Vance, 58, ruled in at least one other major race-related case.The 11th Circuit in 1985 overturned a lower court's ruling andcleared the way for prosecution of 10 Ku Klux Klansmen for a bloodyMay 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers in Decatur,Ala. After the ruling, all 10 defendants pleaded guilty or wereconvicted.   The 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, handles federal appeals fromAlabama, Georgia and Florida. Authorities said the Atlanta bomb wasin a mailed package addressed to the 11th Circuit court, not to aparticular individual.</TEXT></DOC>
