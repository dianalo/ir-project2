Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LKS ASC </CO><IN> TNM RFD </IN><TEXT>   Lucky Stores Inc. shares climbed $2 in heavy trading, as arbitragers bet a higher bid will emerge to top American Stores Co.'s planned $45-a-share tender offer.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the Dublin, Calif., grocery chain's shares closed at $48.75. As previously reported, Lucky's stock, which had hovered around $32 a share, zoomed $14.50 Tuesday after American Stores' plans for a $1.74 billion unsolicited bid were made public.    If Lucky decides to fight the bid, its options appear limited to taking the company private through a leveraged buy-out offering holders a premium to the planned offer, or finding a friendly suitor to outbid Salt Lake City-based American Stores.    Charles Cerankosky, an analyst at Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., Cleveland, said that if Lucky is taken out through an LBO or a buy-out, &quot;the price would be in the $53- to $58-a-share range.&quot;    But Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner yesterday urged the sale of Lucky shares, analyst Ronald Rotter said.    A higher bid is possible, he said, but the borrowing required would put a crimp in Lucky's ability to expand operations or improve stores. Mr. Rotter said the fight Lucky successfully waged 15 months ago against takeover efforts by investor Asher B. Edelman involved a massive restructuring that effectively stripped it of underperforming assets to be sold off.    Also, Mr. Rotter said, Lucky has been well run, and thus doesn't hold the promise some &quot;undermanaged&quot; firm might offer.    Many observers think American Stores, which has grown skittish at the takeovers in the grocery industry in the past two years, is going after Lucky in part to make itself less attractive to a raider.    John Kosecoff, a First Manhattan Co. analyst, said American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs is &quot;an efficient bidder and disciplined in his acquisition prices.&quot; While Mr. Kosecoff thinks Lucky will likely go for a higher bid than the current $45, he added, &quot;I don't think (Mr. Skaggs) will get into a bidding war. He's not a raider, he wants to own&quot; Lucky. </TEXT></DOC>
