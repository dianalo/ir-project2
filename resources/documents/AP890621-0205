TROTT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chinese students across the nation have sent aletter to Congress urging stricter sanctions against their homeland,and to express their impatience with the Bush Administration'sresponse to the Beijing killings.   ``What bothers me is not what is being done, but what is beingsaid,'' said Pei Min Xin, a graduate student at Harvard Universitywho helped draft the letter.   ``Secretary of State (James A.) Baker says we should treat thisrelationship as a very important one to preserve. But for allintents and purposes, the relationship is dead and gone,'' he saidWednesday.   The letter, co-signed by Chinese student organizations from 68American universities _ including Harvard and Yale University,Bush's alma mater _ and Scotland's University of Edinburgh, sayseconomic and diplomatic sanctions against the hard-line Chinesegovernment can be as effective as U.S. sanctions were againstPoland's communist regime.   ``(Congress) should now take the lead in promoting `universalrespect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms'by themselves imposing sanctions against the goverment of DengXiaoping and by urging America's allies to do the same,'' the lettersaid.   The organizations that signed it represent more than 7,000Chinese students, said Pei, who Tuesday appeared before U.S. House'ssubcommittee on international banking and outlined the letter'sproposed economic sanctions.   Pei, a 31-year-old political science student, said the UnitedStates' relationship with China is outdated despite Bush's personalinterest in the country where he formerly served as ambassador.   ``The relationship was built on a common fear of the SovietUnion,'' said Pei. ``The threat from the Soviet Union has diminisheda great deal toward the West and the United States, and hasdisappeared against China.''   The letter calls for the following steps if the Chinesegovernment does not ``cease and desist from further atrocities'':   _The removal of China's ``Most Favored Nation'' trade status.   _Freezing all credit to China from the World Bank, theInternational Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank.   _Reimposing restrictions on exports to China regulated by theCommerce Department.   ``These sanctions must remain in place until martial law islifted and all reprisals against the leaders and supporters of thepro-democracy moveent are terminated,'' the letter said.   If China continues to arrest the demonstrators and does notcommute the death sentences imposed on some, the Chinese studentspropose:   _The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations should call foremergency sessions of the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly.   _Ending all credit guarantees against China.   _Suspension of the procession of China's application tomembership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, theintertional trade body.   On Wednesday, the Chinese government executed three men for theirroles in the student-led protests that ended when the army movedagainst students and supporters in Beijing on June 3-4, killing upto 3,000 people, according to some estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
