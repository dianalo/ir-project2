REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nearly four years ago, Corazon Aquinostood before television cameras and proclaimed that a ``dark nightof tyranny'' had come to an end in the Philippines.   Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, had been driven intoexile in Hawaii by the ``people power revolution'' that broughtMrs. Aquino to power.   The ``night of tyranny'' she referred to in taking her oath aspresident on Feb. 25, 1986, may have ended, but poverty,insurgency, crime and social inequities remain.   Mrs. Aquino arrives in the United States on Tuesday, aftervisiting Canada, in search of more trade and investment in thePhilippines to cope with those problems at home. From Vancouver,Toronto and Ottawa in Canada, she is scheduled to visit New York,Washington for a meeting with President Bush, and Dallas, beforeheading home via either Los Angeles or San Francisco. She'll conferwith businessmen in New York and Dallas.   But the struggle to deal with economic problems, armedinsurgencies and coup attempts has sapped the euphoria andpolitical vitality that in 1986 drove Marcos to Hawaii, where hedied Sept. 22 at the age of 72, and vaulted Mrs. Aquino to theoffice that many thought should have been her husband's.   It was the assassination of the husband, Sen. Benigno AquinoJr., on Aug. 21, 1983, that set off the chain of events that led tothe ``people power revolution'' in the Philippines.   Aquino, who had been imprisoned by Marcos for seven years beforebeing allowed to leave for exile in the United States, wasreturning home that August day to challenge Marcos; he was shot todeath as he stepped off a plane at Manila's airport.   But today in Corazon Aquino's Philippines, a feeling persiststhat nothing has changed since the Marcos years.   Recently, the Social Weather Stations polling service said only35 percent of 300 Manilans surveyed were satisfied with Mrs.Aquino, down from a high of 77 percent two years ago.   ``There is a growing number of people who are dissatisfied withher,'' said Rev. Joaquin Bernas, president of Ateneo University andan Aquino supporter. ``Satisfaction is going down steadily. Halfwayin her fourth year she has not rebounded.''   Inflation today is 12 percent. Allegations of corruption abound.   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop and thenation's leading churchman, often comments that Filipinos ridthemselves of ``Ali Baba, but the 40 thieves remain.'' By Ali Babahe means Marcos.   ``Because of poverty and lack of education, people end up beingvictims of injustice,'' said Luis Villafuerte, chairman of theGovernors League of the Philippines. ``If you cannot improve thatsituation, you can say you have a democracy, you have elections,you have a Congress, but it means nothing to people who are poorand suffering.''   Human rights abuses continue, as do killings by Communistinsurgents. The killings include the assassination in April of Col.James Rowe of the U.S. Army and the slayings of two other Americansin September.   Ordinary Filipinos are threatened by rising crime, much of itcommitted by police and soldiers, including car thefts, murders andbank robberies. Police say the crime rate has increased by 6.5percent since Mrs. Aquino took office.   For the first six months of this year, the monthly crime indexstood at 20.17 incidents per 100,000 people. More than 15 percentof the nation's 72,730 recorded crimes occurred in greater Manila.   The Social Weather Stations survey said 25 percent of the 300Manila residents polled reported they had been victims of crime.   But no groundswell of opposition appears to be building againstMrs. Aquino, known affectionately as Cory.   Attempts by the left and right to organize huge streetdemonstrations have largely fizzled. Filipinos appear moreconcerned with the struggle for a decent living.   But there is a feeling Mrs. Aquino might be missing a historicopportunity to transform the Philippines into a model ofprogressive Asian democracy.   Mrs. Aquino can point to significant accomplishments. She hasrestored democratic institutions, unshackled the press and heldback Communist and Moslem insurgents.   The economy has grown steadily and is expected to increase byabout 6 percent this year. But economic gains have mostlybenefitted upper middle class entrepreneurs with little filteringdown to the masses.   Government figures indicate the lowest third of society controlsonly 9 percent of the national income, virtually the same as underMarcos. Millions subsist on incomes barely adequate for food andlodging.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
