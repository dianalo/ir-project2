The advantages are(1) better sensitivity than laboraory Ge spectrometers, (2) countingtimes reduced by a factor of 30--50 for equivalent statistical accuracyin the laboratory, (3) much larger areas or masses of soil can be evaluatedwith more meaningful extrapolations, (4) ``hot spots'' or concentrationsof high radioactivity can be identified and immediately investigated,(5) hypotheses can be readily tested, and (6) sampling for materialsto be returned to the laboratory can be carried out more logically. Amathematical method for quantifying soil activity on the basis of fieldspectrometric measurements, a calibration procedure, and a generalizedcomputer code for application to a variety of detector geometries andsource distributions are also presented. 16 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
