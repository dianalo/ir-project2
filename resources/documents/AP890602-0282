Twelve ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries met in a 90-minute session that preceded formalstrategy sessions set to begin Monday.   The ministers declined to give details of their talks, whichwere not attended by Qatar. OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, theNigerian oil minister, would only say the officials discussed ``thewhole agenda.''   Venezuela's oil chief, Celestino Armas, said the officials wouldmeet again Saturday and Sunday.   The ministers are attempting to fashion a new accord that willguide their pricing and output policies for the last six months ofthe year.   The cartel last November reached an accord governing productionfor the first half of 1989. The agreement set an OPEC outputceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day, sharply under actualproduction levels of late last year, in an attempt to support atarget price $18 a barrel.   Prices are now more than 40 percent higher than when theagreement was made, partly due to accidents in oil producing areasthat have caused supply disruptions.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEChas soared from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November to nearly$17.70 this week, although it topped $18 earlier this year.   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, closed up 33 cents at $20.14 a barrel Friday on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   Some officials predict the ministers may decide to extend theircurrent accord temporarily if they cannot reach a quick consensus.   Some OPEC ministers have presented new ideas for an accord, butmost appear unwilling to want any changes that could upset what hasbeen a surprisingly strong market so far this year.   Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister, said, ``The mainobjective of the meeting is to have stability.''   Evenness in the market, he said, ``will be brought by productionlevels in accordance with demand.''   The ministers must consider whether to maintain their productionceiling at 18.5 million barrels a day, or boost it some to 19.5million or 20 million barrels. Some analysts say OPEC already isproducing in excess of 20 million barrels a day.   Affecting their decision will be estimates on demand for theiroil in the second half of the year.   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil MarketReport, predicted demand for OPEC crude would rise to 20.4 millionbarrels a day in the last six months of the year.   If the producers agree to increase their output cap, they thenhave the tricky task of dividing up the extra amount.   Several nations, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,are pressing to enlarge their quotas. Ecuador and Gabon also wouldlike more, officials say.   Analysts say the Saudi Arabian delegation has suggested liftingthe overall ceiling by 1 million barrels a day and giving some ofthe extra to those four nations.   The ministers also must decide whether to maintain the $18 abarrel target price, which has been in effect since January 1987.   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said on his arrival inVienna that he would suggest eliminating the reference price, buthas declined to elaborate on the plan. Nazer has said previouslythat an option would be to eliminate the benchmark price in favorof strict adherence to production quotas.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
