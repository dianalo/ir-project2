L. 99-401, and as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,Title VII, Subtitle D, of Pub. L. 100-690 (hereinafter referred to as the``Act''). The Victims of Crime Act has been codified at 42 U.S.C. 10601,<T3>et seq.</T3> These proposed Guidelines when published in final willsupersede all previous Program Guidelines issued by the Office for Victimsof Crime to implement the Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grantprogram. The Act provides Federal financial assistance to States for the purposeof compensating and otherwise assisting victims of crime, and also providesfunds for training and technical assistance and assisting victims of Federalcrimes. These proposed Guidelines provide program background, eligibilityrequirements, and administrative procedures for the implementation of thecrime victim assistance grant program as outlined in Section 1404 (a) ofthe Act. These proposed Guidelines are based on the experience gained duringthe first four years of the program's implementation and are responsiveto the amendments to the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. The Victims of Crime Act was amended in 1988 to provide funding to previouslyunderserved victim populations. (Subsection 1404 (a)(2)(B). However, theAct does not recommend any specific level of funds to be provided to underservedpopulations. After careful consideration of the legislative history, theOffice for Victims of Crime is recommending that at least 10% of a State'svictim assistance grant funds be utilized for programs providing servicesto this population. Comment is especially invited on this provision ofthe proposed Guidelines. (See Section III of this proposed Program Guideline.)The Office for Victims of Crime is interested in the views of state administrators,victim service providers, advocates, and other interested parties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments are due on or before April 6, 1989.

TitleVII, Subtitle D, of this Act reauthorized the Victims of Crime Act of 1984through Federal Fiscal Year 1994.The Office for Victims of Crime was established in 1984 within the Departmentof Justice to serve as the Federal focal point for victim issues and toadminister the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended. For the firsttime, section 1411 of the Act legislatively established an Office for Victimsof Crime within the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.The Director reports to the Attorney General through the Assistant AttorneyGeneral for the Office of Justice Programs, and has the final authorityfor all grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts awarded by the Officeof Victims of Crime. The Director is responsible for administering fundsmade available under section 1402, 1403 and 1404 of the Act; establishingprograms in accordance with section 1404(c) on terms and conditions determinedby the Director to be consistent with that subsection; and cooperatingwith and providing technical assistance to States, units of local government,and other public and private organizations or international agencies involvedin activities related to crime victims.The fundamental approach of these Program Guidelines is to maximize Stateauthority within the context of congressional intent of the Act. In thisway, Federal intrusion on the States decision-making authority will beappropriately limited. Indeed, from its inception, the Act has stronglyfavored State autonomy within Federally determined guidelines. Programapplication, reporting, and evaluation requirements have been establishedat a level necessary to maintain proper Federal stewardship for the fundsand to report to the President and Congress on the impact of the funding.These Guidelines do not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 as they do not result in: (a) An effect on the economy of $100million or more; (b) a major increse in any costs or prices; or (c) adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, or innovationamong American enterprises.In addition, because these Guidelines will not have significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, no analysis of the impactof these rules on such entities is required by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>The collection of information requirements contained in Section V of theProgram Guidelines has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h).Proposed Guidelines for the compensation and the Federal grant programswill be published separately in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="85">Discussion of Victim Assistance Grant Program, Background, LegislativeChanges and Program Policy</ITAG>The primary purpose of the VOCA victim assistance grant program is to assiststates in providing high quality services that directly improve the healthand well-being of victims of crime. A wide range of services for victimsof crime are supported by this Act. They include, but are not limited to,ensuring that victims receive timely notification about the various proceedingsinvolved in prosecuting the person accused of the crime and counselingto help the victim overcome the emotional trauma of victimization. Congresshas supported the view that some services are more directly related tothe emotional healing and recovery of the victim than others.Since there are not enough dollars available in the Crime Victims Fundto permit funding of all victims services, it is the intent of VOCA toensure that services that directly improve the health and well-being ofthe victim receive first consideration when planning the distribution oflimited Crime Victims Fund monies. The Office for Victims of Crime encouragesState administrators to consider first the funding of programs that offercounseling services, shelter, and other emergency assistance that addressthe devastating psychological and emotional consequences experienced byvictims of crime and their families. Consequently, programs meeting theimmediate, short-term emergency needs of crime victims should be consideredfor funding over programs offering other types of services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Crime Victims Fund Distribution</ITAG>The reauthorization legislation establishes a ceiling of $125 million inFiscal Years 1989-1991 and $150 million in Fiscal Years 1992-1994 for theCrime Victims Fund (hereinafter referred to as the ``Fund'').Monies deposited in the Fund shall be made available in the following manner.Of the first $100 million deposited in the Fund: 49.5% shall be made availablefor victim compensation program grants; 45% shall be made available forvictim assistance program grants; 1% shall be available for support ofservices to Federal crime victims (of which up to 0.5% may be made availablefor training and technical assistance projects for eligible victim assistanceprograms), and 4.5% shall be made available under the provisions of theChildren's Justice and Assistance Act of 1986. Of the 4.5% made availableto the Department of Health and Human Services to improve the investigationand prosecution of child abuse, especially child sexual abuse cases, 15%shall be made available for assisting Native American tribes in developing,establishing, and operating programs designed to similarly improve thehandling of child abuse cases, especially child sexual abuse cases in Indiancountry. This 15% shall be administered by the Office for Victims of Crime.The next $5,500,000 deposited in the Fund above the first $100 million(i.e., any amounts between $100 million and $105.5 million) shall be madeavailable for Children's Justice Act grant purposes. Deposits in excessof $105,500,000, but <T3>not</T3> in excess of the $110 million ceiling for Fiscal Years 1989,1990, and 1991, shall be made available for victim assistance program grants.Of deposits in excess of the $110 million and up to the ceiling, 47.5%shall be made available for victim compensation program grants, 47.5% shallbe made available for victim assistance program grants, and 5% shall bemade available for services to victims of Federal crimes. If the total deposited in the Fund during a particular year reaches theceiling, the excess shall <T3>not</T3> be a part of the Fund. The first $2.2 million of such excessshall be available to the Federal judicial branch for administrative coststo carry out the functions of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courtswith respect to the collection of criminal fines and penalty assessments.(Subsection 1402(c)(1)(A).) The remaining monies shall be deposited inthe General Fund of the United States Treasury. No deposits shall be made in the Fund after September 30, 1994, under thecurrent reauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="85">Recent Changes in the Distribution of Victim Assistance Funds to theStates </ITAG>The 1988 amendments to the Victims of Crime Act increased the base amounteach State shall receive in victim assistance funds from $100,000 to $150,000for Fiscal Year 1989, 1990, and 1991, and to $200,000 for Fiscal Years1992, 1993, and 1994. (Section 1404(a)(5) (A) and (B).) In addition, for the purposes of allocating the base amounts to the States,the United States Virgin Islands and all territories and possessions ofthe United States are to be included along with the District of Columbiaand Puerto Rico. (Section 1404(d)(1).) <ITAG tagnum="84">Priority Categories and ``Underserved'' Victim Populations </ITAG>The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 requires each State to certify that ``priority''will be given to programs serving victims of sexual assult, spousal abuseand child abuse. In reporting to the President and Congress on the impactof the Victims of Crime Act grant program, the Office of Justice Programsindicated that 76% of the monies allocated to State victim assistance programswent to programs serving victims of sexual assault, spousal abuse and childabuse. These monies funded 82% of the VOCA supported programs. The remainingVOCA funds supported a variety of specialized and generic victim services.This determination was made after a subgrant-by-subgrant review of allawards made in Fiscal Year 1986 by the States was conducted. (See <T3>Report to Congress by the Attorney General</T3>, April 1988.) During reauthorization, there was considerable discussion of the extentto which funds were utilized to support victims in the three priority categories.After reviewing available data and hearing testimony from national organizations,programs, and individuals representing victims of other violent crimes,Congress amended VOCA to require that each State ``certify that funds shallbe made available for grants to programs which serve previously underservedpopulations of victims of violent crime.'' (See Section 1404(a)(2(B).)In doing so, Congress reaffirmed the special needs of the priority categoryvictims, but also recognized the needs of victims of violent crimes whohave received little support through VOCA victim assistance grant funds.OVC is aware that the Congressional Record reflects a discrepancy in theviews of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate regardingthe underserved populations amendment contained in the VOCA reauthorization(Section 1404(a)(2)(b)). The following is a colloquy between Mr. Bidenand Mr. Kennedy:<ITAG tagnum="21">[Mr. Biden:] Do you anticipate that this priority will be implementedby the Department of Justice in a manner similar to the other priorityprograms listed in the Victims of Crime Act? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[Mr. Kennedy:] Yes. As the section-by-section analysis of the Senatebill clearly stated the Department of Justice shall require that Statesdevote approximately 10 percent of their funds to this new priority category,as with the existing priority programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[Mr. Biden:] ``That was also my understanding. I thank the Senator.''(See Congressional Record_Senate, page 17324, October 21, 1988.)</ITAG>However, the Section-By-Section Analysis of this amendment inserted byMr. Conyers, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, reflectsa different view:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Senate-passed bill contained a provision similar to new section1404(a)(2)(B). During the debate on the Senate bill, it was indicated thatit was intended that that provision be interpreted to require a chief executiveto use at least 10% of the State's funds under section 1404 for those programs.The clear language of the provision in the Senate-passed bill did not requirethat, however. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such an interpretation was unacceptable, and a provision with thatinterpretation would not have been agreed to. The language of new section1404(a)(2)(B) imposes no requirement upon the chief executive of a Stateto allocate a specified minimum percentage of Crime Victims Fund moneyto programs serving `underserved populations of victims of violent crime'.We agreed to new section 1404(a)(2)(B) with no intention that the provisionbe interpreted to impose such a minimum requirement. (Congressional Record_House,page 11261, October 21, 1988)</ITAG>Mr. Fish added:<ITAG tagnum="21">This is intended to promote the broadest effort possible to assistvictims of violent crime and to ensure that no category of victim is ignored.''(Congressional Record_House, page 11240, October 21, 1988).</ITAG>In addition Mr. Miller stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">As one who was involved in the negotiations between the House andthe other body, I would like to make clear for the record that, in thatform, this provision was not acceptable. The representatives of the otherbody verbally agreed, however, that such a requirement was not mandatedby the statutory language and that it would not insist upon such a requirement.The House concurrence in this provision_with some changes in language_waswith the explicit understanding that the provision did not bind the chiefexecutive to allocate any given percentage of crime victims fund moneyto programs serving previously underserved populations of victims of violentcrime.'' (Congressional Record_House, page 11263, October 21, 1988)</ITAG>In implementing this new requirement, the Office for Victims of Crime hasconsidered the conflicting perspectives expressed by members of Congressand constituency groups. With regard to the degree financial support thatshould be made available for ``previously underserved victims,'' OVC believesthat an interpretation which results in increased attention to previouslyunderserved populations of victims and sets a minimum level of fundingwill best meet the unmet needs of a broad range of victims of violent crime.Therefore, States are directed in these proposed guidelines to allocateat least 10% of their VOCA assistance funds to such programs. In this way,previously underserved victims of violent crime identified by each Statewill constitute a single category for which at least 10% of the States'VOCA assistance funds must be allocated. OVC does not intend to define what constitutes ``previously underservedpopulations.'' Rather, it is expected that States will have flexibilityin determining which groups of victims would be ``underserved.'' Each State must identify previously underserved victim populations in theirState and develop specific plans to address the availability of victimassistance service grants in these areas. The Office for Victims of Crimeencourages States not to solely consider underserved victim populationswhich were mentioned in congressional discussions of the amendment, i.e.,homicide survivors, victims or survivors of victims of drunk driving. Statesshould also consider the broad range of unmet victims' needs and the obstacleswhich prevent the delivery of services. OVC recognizes the specialized needs of priority area victims and the skillsrequired of service providers in assisting these victims. In Fiscal Years1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 States were given three options for meetingthe three priority area requirements of the Victims of Crime Act legislation.These options were provided to meet the variety of State needs and to maximizeState flexibility in implementing the Victims of Crime Act victim assistancegrant program. As in the development of any new program, knowledge is granted from experience.While preparing the Report to Congess, and in correspondence from Stateadministrators and service providers, and during the reauthorization hearings,OVC learned of many concerns regarding the allocation of Victims of CrimeAct victim assistance grant funds. Therefore, the Office for Victims ofCrime has reviewed the options which were presented to States during thefirst four fiscal years of the program, the number of States which selectedthe various options, and the States' reports regarding their ultimate allocationof funding to priority services. As a result of this analysis, the Officefor Victims of Crime has determined that a single approach which reflectsa combination of elements from the three previous options would serve toclarify elements from the three previous options would serve to clarifythis program requirement and better effectuate the intent of Congress.Henceforth,<ITAG tagnum="21">Each State shall allocate at least ten percent of its total Victimsof Crime Act victim assistance grant to each of the three priority categories,and at least ten percent to programs which serve victims determined bythe State to have been previously underserved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">States are encouraged to engage in discussion with victims, victimadvocates, and services providers throughout the State and to assess theneeds of underserved populations. Each State is further required to discussin its application to the Office for Victims of Crime the method used toidentify previously underserved victim populations and its plan for fundingservices to such groups.</ITAG>The ten percent figure provided in these proposed Program Guidelines isintended to represent a base amount of funding to the priority areas, andto give each State discretion to determine the level of additional fundingneeded. The Office for Victims of Crime believes it is incumbent upon eachState, not the Federal Government, to determine if funding in excess ofthe minimum base amount level established by the Office for Victims ofCrime is needed in a particular priority area. In no way is the 30% baseamount targeted for programs serving priority victims nor the 10% baseamount targeted for programs serving previously underserved victim populationsintended to establish a cap on the amount allocated to programs servingthese categories of crime victims. Experience has shown States have allocatedthe vast majority of VOCA funds to programs which serve victims of childabuse, spouse abuse, and sexual assault. However, it is also noted thatthe requirement to give priority to services for victims of spouse abuse,sexual assault, and child abuse has not been and is not intended to conveythat States may not provide funding for other types of services. For purposes of this program, the Office for Victims of Crime defines apriority program as one whose <T3>principal mission</T3> is providing services to one or more of thepriority victim categories. While programs which provide services to allvictims of crime are needed in communities these are not considered tobe priority programs. However, many priority programs provide servicesto more than one priority group. For example, many sexual assault programsserve adult victims of sexual assault and child victims of sexual abuseand molestation, and many shelter programs also provide services to victimsof child abuse who accompany their mothers who are victims of spouse abuse/familyviolence. This definition reflects OVC's understanding of the intent ofVOCA and is meant to clarify priority programs for purposes of fundingdecisions and reporting requirements. OVC also wishes to clarify that there is no requirement that each programdesignated as a priority program provide what are termed as ``generic''victim services. Further, there is no requirement that all VOCA fundedprograms must serve all types of victims in all ways. <ITAG tagnum="84">Clarification of Allowance Costs and Eligible Programs </ITAG>Section 1404(b)(1) of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, providesspecific criteria for programs to be eligible for victim assistance grantfunds.(See Section III of these proposed Program Guidelines.) The reauthorizationand issuance of these proposed Program Guidelines provide an opportunityto clarify several issues which have emerged regarding the appropriateuse of Victim of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds. The Office forVictims of Crime is mindful of the fact that we now have had four yearsof experience administering VOCA victim assistance grants. After carefulreview of the subgrants made in prior fiscal years, the Office for Victimsof Crime believes it is necessary to articulate policy positions concerningcertain allowable costs and program eligibility. One area of central importance in this discussion is the relationship betweenVOCA crime victim compensation and VOCA victim assistance programs. Intheir initial years of grants, some States used victim assistance grantfunds to supplement crime victim compensation awards to victims of crime.In these cases, some programs receiving VOCA victim assistance grant fundssupplemented crime victim compensation claims when a particular loss orexpense was not covered by the State crime victim compensation program.This is not an appropriate use of limited VOCA victim assistance funds.It is clear in the legislative history that the crime victim compensationprovision of the Act was intended as the sole source of VOCA funding forreimbursement to victims for out-of-pocket expenses relating to a compensablecrime. VOCA victim assistance grant funds, on the other hand, are intendedto support the provision of direct services to victims of crime. Questions have also arisen as to whether local legal services corporation-fundedoffices are eligile as victim assistance subgrantees. Legal services, especiallylegal advocacy services, are not the types of victim services envisionedwhen the Victims of Crime Act was enacted. The ``court related services''eligible for VOCA funding include, but are not limited to, assisting victimswith filing temporary restraining orders, explaining court procedures,accompanying a crime victim to court, providing child care services forcrime victims while they participate in essential court proceedings, providingtransportation to and from court, and providing emotional support to crimevictims during a trial. However, a legal services agency is not deemedineligible as long as it provides the emergency services discussed above,e.g. securing temporary restraining orders, etc. Such programs may seekVOCA funding for the above-described emergency services. Crime victim assistance funds may be used only to provide direct servicesto victims of crime. Any costs for activities not directly related or essentialto the delivery of assistance to crime victims may not be charged to aVOCA victim assistance subgrant. The following activities are ineligiblefor VOCA funding. (1) <T3>Community Education.</T3> The community education activities eligibleto receive VOCA funds are limited to efforts describing direct servicesavailable and how to obtain a program's assistance, e.g., publication ofbrochures, pamphlets, etc. General public awareness campaigns designedto raise the public's consciousness of victims issues do not qualify asdirect services to crime victims and are ineligible for support with VOCAfunds. (2) <T3>Crime Prevention.</T3> Also ineligible for funding are those programsin which crime victims are not the sole or primary beneficiaries of fundedactivities. The crime prevention activities eligible to receive VOCA fundsare limited to those prevention efforts specifically included in providingemergency assistance after a victimization incident such as services toprevent the immediate reburgularization of a home or an apartment, e.g.boarding up of windows, replacement or repair of security locks, etc. Othermore generalized crime prevention efforts are not allowable. (3) <T3>Lobbying, Legislative and Administrative Advocacy.</T3> Lobbying forparticular victim legislation or administrative reform, whether conducteddirectly or indirectly, is another activity that is an ineligible for fundingwith VOCA victim assistance grant funds. Chapter 5, paragraph 74, subsection3, of the Office of Justice Programs' <T3>Financial and Administrative Guide for Gants,</T3> M7100.1 ((effectiveedition) hereinafter referrred to as M 7100.1), lists the following activitiesas not allowable: ``Any attempt to influence: (i) the introduction of Federalor State legislation; or (ii) the enactment or modification of any pendingFederal or State legislation through communication with any member or employeeof the Congress or State legislature (including efforts to influence Stateor local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity), or with anygovernment official or employee in connection with a decision to sign orveto enrolled legislation.'' Refer to paragraph 74 of M 7100.1 for furtherinformation on allowable and unallowable activities. (4) <T3>Perpetrator Rehabilitation</T3>. The Office for Victims of Crime hastaken the position that perpetrator counseling and/or rehabilitation isnot a direct service to a victim of crime as intended by VOCA and is, therefore,not an eligible service or activity to be supported by victim assistancegrant funds. However, VOCA funds may be used to support family treatmentprograms that provide direct services to crime victims and rehabilitationor treatment of perpetrators. It is the intention of the Office for Victimsof Crime to support such programs which seek to reunite the family throughtreatment of victims of family violence along with perpetrator rehabilitation.It is <T3>not </T3>our intention to provide VOCA victim assistance funds to supportprograms which are primarily perpetrator/offender treatment programs. Thisrepresents a change in OVC's previous policy which prohibited the fundingof any perpetrator related activities.(5) <T3>Needs Assessments, Surveys, Manuals and Protocols</T3>. The Officefor Victims of Crime has further taken the position that the use of VOCAfunds to conduct needs assessments, surveys, develop manuals and protocol,or to perform general administrative tasks does not fall within the intentof the Act and is outside the scope of the Program Guidelines.(6) <T3>Fundraising</T3>. Chapter 5, Paragraph 75 of M7100.1 lists fund raisingas an unallowable expense: ``Cost of organized fund raising, includingfinancial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests,and similar expenses incurred solely to raise capital or obtain contribution,may not be charged either as direct or indirect cost against the grant.Neither the salary of persons engaged in such activities nor indirect costsassociated with those salaries can be charged to the grant, except insofaras such persons perform other grant-related activities.''(7) <T3>Equipment Purchases/Capital Expenditures</T3>. Section 1404(b)(2) providesthat Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds may only be usedto provide services to victims of crime. Services to victims of crime meansthose activities that <T3>directly </T3>benefit individual crime victims, including the requiredcoordination of such activities, i.e., coordination of volunteers and/orcoordination of public and private efforts to aid crime victims. However,equipment that is necessary and essential to the delivery of direct serviceis deemed by the Office for Victims of Crime as an allowable cost.(8) <T3>Professional Services of Doctors and Lawyers</T3>. The payment of feesfor professional services rendered by lawyers and doctors extends beyondthe intent of the Act and are, therefore, ineligible for VOCA victim assistancefunding. Except for the purposes of providing reimbursement for forensicmedical examinations, as provided in section III, D(2)(e) of the Act, victimstreated for crime related injuries are encouraged to seek reimbursementfor medical services rendered by doctors from their State crime victimscompensation program. This provision, however, does not prohibit directservice programs from hiring as staff salaried medical/mental health professionalsto provide services on site to clients. This differs significantly froma case by case fee-for-service type arrangement.(9) <T3>Witness Management and Notification Programs</T3>. Projects whose primaryobjectives are to improve the prosecutorial efficiency of a prosecutor'soffice and whose goals are primarily witness management and notificationare identified as administrative in nature and are, therefore, ineligiblefor support with Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant funds. However,victim/witness programs in prosecutors offices, which provide both victimservices such as escort and support during trials and other type of services,can receive VOCA funding support only for that portion of the program thatprovides direct services to crime victims.(10) <T3>Criminal Justice Improvements</T3>. General criminal justice agencyimprovements or programs where crime victims are not the sole or primarybeneficiaries are not eligible for support with VOCA victim assistancegrant funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Match</ITAG><T3>Required Match for New and Existing Programs</T3>. The Office for Victimsof Crime has initiated a new policy with respect to the required matchfor ``new'' and ``existing'' programs; the program match has been reducedfor both. The Act requires that ``existing'' programs have a record ofproviding effective services to victims of crime and financial supportfrom other sources and requires that ``new'' programs that have not yetdemonstrated a record of effective services have substantial financialsupport from other sources. The Office for Victims of Crime believes thatthe current match requirements are too stringent and may have inhibitedthe development of much needed specialized services in underserved or remoteareas. Therefore, the match requirement for ``existing'' programs has beenlowered from 25% to 20% cash or in-kind; and for ``new'' programs, thematch has been lowered from 50% to 35% cash <T3>or in-kind</T3>. In addition to the lower match requirement for newprograms, the provision for in-kind match for new programs has been added.The Office for Victims of Crime believes these new match requirements willbetter reflect the intent of the Act regarding the continuity of existingcrime victim assistance programs while also addressing recent Congressionalconcern for the development of new victim services programs for previouslyunderserved victim populations.<T3>New Match Requirements for Native American Tribes or Native AmericanOrganizations on Indian Reservations</T3>. The Office for Victims of Crimehas initiated a policy to permit a 5 percent minimum ``match'' of cashor in-kind for grants to Indian tribes or native American organizationson reservations under the Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grantprogram. OVC has decided to implement this provision in response to theunique situation of native American Indian tribes in our nation, and theirspecial problems and needs. In the past, we have found that the victimassistance match requirement are virtually impossible for Indian tribesto meet because of the tribes' meager financial resources. The result hasbeen that the tribes have been unable to achieve full participation inthe VOCA victim assistance program and significant Indian victim needshave gone unattended. This policy is intended to respond to the difficultiesexperienced by Indian tribes in providing matching funds. This is furtherintended to remind the States of their obligations to Indian tribes andsimilar groups to involve Indian tribes and such groups in full participationin this Federal assistance program.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>This policy is limited to native American Indian tribesor native American organizations on Indian reservations.</ITAG><T3>Overmatch</T3>. In a number of the States' subgrant award reports,the Office for Victims of Crime has noted that subgrantees designated asubstantial protion or all of their non-Federal dollars as match. Statesand subgrantees should be mindful that any funds designated as matchingfunds for Federal dollars are restricted to the same uses outlined in theProgram Guidelines for Federal funds. Therefore, it is suggested that subgranteesonly provide match at the level required by the Program Guidelines (i.e.,20% for existing programs, and 35% for new programs). In that way, thereare no Federal restrictions on the non-Federal dollars not used by subgrantprograms as match.<T3>Basis of Match</T3>. The proposed Program Guidelines will continueto require match on a project-by-project basis. <T3>No exceptions will be granted to this policy</T3>. Programs receivingblock funds must maintain records which clearly show the source, the amount,and the timing of all matching contributions. The M7100.1 also places primaryresponsibility on the State to ensure subgrantee compliance with this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Seed Money</ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime has received numerous inquiries from programsin States where State administrators have established a policy limitingthe number of years a program may receive a VOCA victim assistance grantfrom the State. OVC has given consideration to these inquiries and thepolicies adopted by these States and has decided not to issue a formalpolicy/guideline regarding this practice. Instead, OVC encourages Statesto take into consideration in developing program funding policy, the rangeof victim services needed throughout the State, the track record of fundedprograms and the extent to which other sources of funding are availableto new proposed projects and previously funded VOCA projects. However,the recent amendment to VOCA which mandates attention to underserved populationsindicates Congressional concern about the extent to which victim servicesare available to victims outside the priority areas. Thus, States are encouragedto carefully examine their various victim service needs and expand intonew service areas as crime victim funds increase.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. General Provisions</ITAG>A. <T3>Eligible Applicants</T3>: All States including the District of Columbia,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, andall other territories and possessions of the United States are eligibleto apply for and receive Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grants.(See Section 1404 (d)(1) of the Act.)

Note: TheFederal fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of thefollowing year.B. <T3>Allocation to States</T3>: Each State, the District of Columbia, PuertoRico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any territory and possessionshall receive a base amount of $150,000 in fiscal years 1989 through 1991,and a base amount of $200,000 thereafter through fiscal year 1994, andthat portion of the then remaining available money to each State that resultsfrom a distribution among the States on the basis of each State's populationin relation of all States. They shall, also, receive a portion of the availableremaining monies based on their share of the total population using themost recent data of the U.S. Bureau of Census.C. <T3>Allocation of Funds within the States</T3>: Funds granted to the Statesare to be further subgranted within the State to eligible victim servicesprograms. The State has sole discretion as to which programs providingdirect services to crime victims receive funds, so long as the eligibilitycriteria set-out in the Act and enumerated in these proposed Guidelinesare met.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.Program Requirements</ITAG>A. <T3>Priority</T3>. Under the Act, the chief executive of the State mustcertify that the State shall give priority to eligible crime victim assistanceprograms which as their principle mission provide direct assistance tovictims of sexual assault, spousal abuse, or child abuse, and to programsserving previously underserved populations of victims of violent crimeas determined by each State. [See Section 1404 (a)(2)(A) and (B) of theAct.] To meet this requirement, each State shall allocate at least tenpercent of its total Victims of Crime Act victim assistance grant to eachof the three priority categories and at least ten percent to programs whichserve victims determined by the State to have been previously underserved.Each State is further required to describe in its application the proceduresused to identify previously underserved victim populations and the methodplanned for allocating VOCA funding for these services.B. <T3>Non-supplanting</T3>. The chief executive of the State or his/her designatedState Administrator must certify that crime victim assistance grant fundswill not be used to supplant State and local funds that would otherwisebe available for crime victim services. [See Section 1404(a)(2)(B) of theAct.] Federal grant funds are intended to enhance or expand services, notsubstitute for other sources of support.C. <T3>Eligibility Criteria</T3>. States must use crime victim assistancegrant funds to support programs that provide direct services to crime victims.Each individual victim assistance project receiving a crime victim assistancesubgrant must meet the following eligibility requirements:(1) Be operated by a public agency or nonprofit organization or a combinationthereof that provides direct services to crime victims;(2) If it is an existing program, have a record of providing effectiveservices to victims of crime and financial support from other sources.In determining whether or not a program has a ``record of providing effectiveservices,'' the State shall consider whether the program has been providingservices to victims of crime for a minimum of one year, has the supportand approval of its services by the community, and whether or not an analysisof its activities and financial history shows that it achieves its intendedresults in a cost-effective manner. An existing program shall be consideredto have ``financial support from other [non-Federal] sources'' if at least20% of its support (including in-kind contributions) is from non-Federalsources, or an appropriation, as provided in Chapter 2, paragraph 14 (c)(2)(b)of the M 7100.1. (See Section 1404 (b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act.)<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Funds subgranted to Indian tribes or Native American organizationson Indian reservations will require only a 5 percent minimum match (cashor in-kind) of the total costs of the VOCA supported victim assistanceprogram or project.</ITAG>(3) If it is a new program that has not yet demonstrated a record of effectiveservices as required under (2) above, it may be eligible for funding ifit demonstrates substantial financial support from non-Federal sources.``Substantial financial support'' means that at least thirty-five percent(35%) of its budget is in the form of a <T3>cash or in-kind </T3>contributions from non-Federal sources or an appropriationas provided in Chapter 2, paragraph 14(c)(2)(b) of the M 7100.1. [See Section1404(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.]<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>Funds subgranted to Indian tribes or Native American organizationson Indian reservations will require only a 5 percent minimum match (cashor in-kind) of the total costs of the VOCA supported victim assistanceprogram or project.</ITAG>(4) Utilizes volunteers unless, and to the extent, the State chief executivedetermines compelling reasons exist to waive this requirement. A ``compellingreason'' may include statutory or contractual provisions that bar the useof volunteers for certain positions or a lack of persons volunteering aftera sustained and aggressive recruitment effort has been conducted. (5) Promotes within the community served coordinated public and privateefforts to aid crime victims. (See Section 1404(b)(1)(D) of the Act.) Becauseof the various kinds of services needed by victims of crime, services areusually provided by a variety of agencies. Therefore, it is essential thatthese services be coordinated to ensure continuity of support to the victimand to avoid duplication of effort. In determining whether or not a programmeets this requirement, the State shall consider the extent to which theprogram demonstrates that it will coordinate its activities with otherservice providers in the community, including Federal victim witness coordinators,so that the best interests of the crime victims are served and interagencycommunication is enhanced. (6) Assists victims in seeking available crime victim compensation benefits.(See Section 1404(b)(1)(E) of the Act.) Such assistance may be achievedby identifying and notifying potential recipients of the availability ofcompensation and assisting them with application forms and procedures.An eligible program must demonstrate that it will coordinate its activitieswith the State compensation program, where one exists. D. Crime victim assistance funds shall be used only to provide direct servicesto victims of crime. (Section 1404(b)(2).) For purposes of these proposedGuidelines, services to victims of crime means those activities that directlybenefit individual crime victims including the required and necessary coordinationof such activities, i.e., coordination of volunteers and/or coordinationof services to the victim which must be provided by other community agencies.Activities unrelated or only tangentially related to the provision of directservices to victims are not eligible for support. Likewise, indirect costswhich are often imposed by Indian tribes on Federal grants are not permissiblein VOCA funded victim assistance grants. (1) Examples of ineligible activities include (see earlier discussion ofeach of the following activities): (a) Community education; (b) Crime prevention programs; (c) Lobbying, legislative or administrative advocacy for particular victimlegislation or administrative reform; (d) Perpetrator rehabilitation or counseling except for those programswhich treat family violence victims and perpetrators, and are aimed atthe reunification of the family; (e) Needs Assessments, Surveys, Manuals, and Protocols; (f) Fundraising (g) Equipment purchases/capital expenditures (h) Professional services of doctors an lawyers(i) Witness management or notification program;(j) Criminal justice improvements.(2) ``Services to victims of crime'' include, but are not limited to, thefollowing; (a) Crisis intervention services that meet the urgent short-term emotionalor physical needs of crime victims. Crisis intervention services programsare encouraged to coordinate the provision of 24 hour services which mayinclude the operation of a crisis hotline that provides emergency counselingor referral for crime victims; (b) Emergency services that provide temporary shelter for crime victimswho cannot safely remain in their current lodgings offer measures suchas repair of locks, or boarding-up of windows to prevent the immediatereburglarization of a home or an apartment, or provide crime victims withpetty cash for meeting immediate needs related to transportation, food,shelter, and other necessities; (c) Support services that include follow-up counseling following the initialtraumatic event; reassurance, empathetic listening, and guidance for resolvingpractical problems created by the victimization experience; acting on thevictims behalf vis-a-vis other social services and criminal justice agencies;assistance in obtaining the swift return of property being kept by policeas evidence; intervention, as appropriate, with landlords, creditors oremployers; and referral to other sources of assistance, as needed; (d) Court-related services that assist crime victims in participating incriminal justice proceedings including transportation to court, child care,and escort services;(e) Payment of all reasonable costs for a forensic medical examinationof a crime victim, to the extent that such costs are not otherwise reimbursedor paid by a third party. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>Funds may only be used to pay for those forensic medicalexaminations that conform to standards adopted by the State or meet theevidentiary requirements of the local prosecutor.</ITAG>E. The State must establish procedures to assure that funds subgrantedto an eligible crime victim assistance program are expended only for providingservices to victims of crime. These procedures shall require a programto demonstrate to the State that the assistance funds it requested aredirectly related to the delivery of services to crime victims. Any costs,with the exception of audit expenses at the subgrant level, not directlyrelated to service delivery for crime victims must not be charged to asubgrant. Programs that serve both victims and non-victims must resonablyprorate their costs to assure that crime victims funds, are used only forvictim services. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV Application Requirements </ITAG>A. <T3>Application Submission. </T3>Applications for crime victim assistancegrants must be submitted by the chief executive officer or his/her designee.The Office for Victims of Crime will provide a program Instruction andApplication Kit to each State. The application kit shall include: SF 424-Applicationfor Federal Assistance, a list of assurances, a table of Fund allocations,and additional guidance on how to prepare and submit an application forcrime victim assistance grants. The Program Instruction and ApplicationKit will serve as the guidance document regarding application submissionand content. B. <T3>Application Specificity. </T3>Applications from the State need notspecify the subgrants the State intends to make with the Federal crimevictim assistance funds it receives. However, in the application, Statesmust identify the ``previously underserved'' crime victim population tobe served in the State with Federal victim assistance grant funds and discusshow the determination was made. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Reporting Requirements</ITAG>A report to the President and Congress from OVC on the monies collectedfor the Crime Victims Fund from each source described in section 1402 andon the effectiveness of the activities supported by the Fund is due onDecember 31, 1990, and on December 31, every two years thereafter. Reporting requirements for this program are designed to provide the Officefor Victims of Crime with meaningful information about the use of VOCAfunds, progress in the delivery of victim services nationwide, and compliancewith VOCA Program Guidelines. Section 1407(b) of the Victims of Crime Act, as amended, requires eachrecipient of Federal victim assistance grant funds to maintain recordsas the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime may prescribe includingrecords that fully disclose the amount and disposition by the recipientof sums, the total cost of the undertaking for which such sums are used,and that portion of the cost of the undertaking supplied by other surces,and any other records that will facilitate an effective audit. Section1407(f) permits the Director to: (1) Terminate payments to a State; (2)suspend payments to a State until the Director is satisfied that noncompliancehas ended; or take other action as appropriate towards any State failingto comply substantially with any provision of the Victims of Crime Actor Program Guidelines requirement. A. <T3>Subgrant Award Report. </T3>The State is required to notify the Officefor Victims of Crime within thirty (30) days of an award of a subgrant,or of a change in an award to a subgrant recipient, and provide all informationrequired to complete a Subgrant Award Report form provided by the Officefor Victims of Crime. This information is required on each individual projectwhich receives Federal Crime victim assistance funds. If Federal victimassistance grant funds are passed through to another agency to furtherdetermine the distribution of funds, a Subgrant Award Report form mustbe completed for each program receiving Federal Victim assistance grantfunds. This report provides the Office for Victims of Crime with informationnecessary to determine compliance with the Victims of Crime Act, ProgramGuidelines, and provides information necessary to determie the status ofVOCA funded victim services in each State. Each State Administrator mustnotify OVC in their application of the approximate number of Subgrant AwardReport forms they will need to meet this program requirement. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>OVC will provide the State with blank forms with the notificationof award or at a later date, if not available at that time.</ITAG>B. <T3>Performance Report.</T3> The State crime victim assistance agency receivingFederal victim assistance grant funds under the Victims of Crime Act isrequired to submit a performance report 90 days after the end of each annualgrant, in the format and on the form provided by the Office for Victimsof Crime. The State Administrator is responsible for compiling the informationand submitting a report to the Office for Victims of Crime. The performancereport provides information on the effect the Federal funds have had onservices to crime victims in the State. This report should be submittedto the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programs, 633 IndianaAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20531, by December 30.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_OVC will provide each State with a copy of the program performancereport form with the notification of award, or at a later date, if notavailable at the time of the award. </ITAG>c. <T3>Financial Status Report.</T3> A Financial Status Report (Form H-1)is required for all grants. This report shall be submitted by the granteewithin 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Final reports aredue 90 days after the end of the grant. Failure to comply with this requirementmay result in administrative action such as the withholding of payments,cancellation of a Letter of Credit, or noncertification of new grant awards.In lieu of using the H-1, grantees may satisfy the financial reportingrequirements by completing the H-1 turnaround document. This document isa facsimile of the H-1 extracted from the grantor agency's computer filesand sent directly to each grantee. Pertinent information such as granteename, address, grant number, and the previously submitted financial information(if any) is printed on the form by the computer.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Obligation and expenditure data must be reported at thesubgrantee level.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Financial Requirements</ITAG>A. <T3>Payment of Grant Funds </T3>1. <T3>Annual Requirements Under $120,000</T3>. Grantees whose annual fundrequirement is less than $120,000 will receive Federal funds on a ``CheckIssued'' basis. Upon receipt, review and approval of a Request for Advanceor Reimbursement, H-3 Report (OJP, Form 7160/3) by the grantor agency,a voucher and a schedule for payment is prepared for the amount approved.This schedule is forwarded to the U.S. Treasury requesting issuance andmailing of the check directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent.A request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs and submittedat least monthly. 2. <T3>Annual Requirements Over $120,000.</T3> Grantees whose annual fundrequirement exceeds $120,000 generally receive Federal funds by utilizingthe ``Letter of Credit'' procedures. This funding method is a cash managementprocess prescribed by the U.S. Treasury for all major grant-in-aid recipients.3. <T3>Check Issuance.</T3> All checks drawn for the payment of fund requests,either under the ``Check Issued'' or the ``Letter of Credit'' process,are prepared and disbursed by the U.S. Treasury and <T3>not</T3> by the grantor agency. 4. <T3>Termination of Advance Funding.</T3> If a grantee organization receivingcash advances by letter of credit or by direct Treasury check demonstratesan unwillingness or inability to establish procedures that will minimizethe time elapsing between cash advances and disbursement, the grantor agencymay terminate advance funding and require the grantee organization to financeits operations with its own working capital. Payments to grantee will thenbe made by the direct Treasury check method to reimburse the grantee foractual cash disbursements. It is essential that the grantee organizationmaintain a minimal amount of cash on hand and that drawdowns of cash aremade only when necessary for disbursements. B. <T3>Cost Allowability.</T3> The Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended,specifically states that crime victim assistance grant funds may be usedonly for providing direct services to victims of crime. Only those costsdirectly related and essential to providing direct services to crime victimscan be charged to the VOCA funded subgrant. The following items requirespecific discussion. For further guidance, see Office of Justice Programs'<T3>Financial and Administrative Guide for Grants, </T3>M7100.1, Chapter5. (1) <T3>Audit costs:</T3> Although under OMB Circular A-128 audit costs aregenerally allowable charges under Federal grants, audit costs incurredat the grantee (State) level are determined to be an administrative expenseand, therefore, <T3>cannot</T3> be paid for with crime victim assistance grant funds. Reasonableaudit costs incurred at the subgrantee level are, however, considered directlyrelated and essential to the operation of the program and may be reimbursedas allowable costs. (2) <T3>Training:</T3> An eligible subgrantee of crime victim assistance grantfunds may only include as a budget item the reasonable cost of staff developmentfor those persons (salaried and volunteer) staff who provide direct servicesto crime victims. Also included as an allowable cost are the necessaryand reasonable travel expenses related to the participation of direct servicestaff in eligible training programs. Such costs are, however, permittedonly within the State or a comparable geographic regon;(3) <T3>Printing and Postage:</T3> An eligible subgrantee of crime victim assistancegrant funds may include as a budget item reasonable costs of printing anddistributing brochures and similar announcements to describe their program'svictim services and how to obtain these services. (4) <T3>Examples of Ineligible Costs include:</T3> the administrative costsassociated with conducting surveys and needs assessments, developing manualsand protocols, fees for professional services rendered by doctors and lawyers,and those costs associated with fundraising activities. c. <T3>Audit Responsibilities.</T3> Pursuant to the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments,''grantees, subgrantees, and subrecipients have the responsibility to providefor an audit of their activities. These audits shall be made annually,unless the State or local government has, by January 1, 1987, a constitutionalor statutory requirement for less frequent audits. Note: Institutions ofhigher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations have theresponsibility to provide for an audit of their activities not less thanevery two years. While governments (state and local) receiving less than$25,000 in any fiscal year are exempt from a single audit, there is noaudit exclusion for private nonprofit organizations. However, where stateand local governments and nonprofit organizations received grants or otheragreements less than $100,000 and do not obtain audits that meet the requirementsof OMB Circulars A-110 and A-128, DOJ grantor organizations shall ensurethat Federal funds are spent in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Techniques to use to determine recipient compliance with Federal requirementsare: (1) Recipient obtained audits made in accordance with the Standards forAudit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functionsissued by the Comptroller General; (2) Previous audits performed on recipients' operations; (3) Desk reviews by program officials of project documentation; (4) Project audits by Federal auditors or auditors obtained by recipients;(5) Evaluations of recipients' operations by program officials. These audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance withgenerally accepted government auditing standards governing financial andcompliance audits. The required audits are to be performed on an organization-widebasis as opposed to a grant-by-grant basis. The audit reports must include:(1) The auditor's reprot on financial statements of the recipient organizationand a schedule of financial assistance showing the total expenditure foreach Federal assistance program; (2) The auditor's report on compliance containing:(A) A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items testedfor compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertainingto financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements; (B) a negative assurance of those items not tested and a summary of allinstances of noncompliance; and (C) the auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal controlsystems, which must identify the organization's significant internal accountingcontrols designed to provide reasonable assurance that Federal programsare being managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulation. Itmust also identify the controls that were evaluated, the controls thatwere not evaluated, and the material weaknesses identified as a resultof that evaluation. D. <T3>Audit Objectives.</T3> Grants and other agreements are awarded subjectto conditions of fiscal, program and general administration to which therecipient expressly agrees. Accordingly, the audit objective is to reviewthe recipient's administration of grant funds and required non-Federalcontributions for the purpose of determining whether the recipient has:(1) Financial statements of the government, department, agency, or establishmentthat present fairly its financial position and the results of its financialoperations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;(2) The organization has internal accounting and other control systemsto provide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal financial assistanceprograms in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and (3) The organization has complied with laws and regulations that may havematerial effect on its financial statements and on each Federal assistanceprogram.E. <T3>Audit Implementation.</T3> Grantees are required to specify their arrangementfor complying with the provisions of OMB Circular A-128 and include intheir grant application, to the extent possible, the following information:(1) The identity of the organization that will conduct the audit;(2) Approximate timing of when the audit will be performed;(3) Audit coverage to be provided. Where the audit will not provide thecoverage requirements as specified previously, the audit policy or proceduresmust describe the specific arrangements for obtaining audit services thatwill meet the requirements;(4) An identification of the audit standards, if any, with which the granteewill not comply;(5) Receipt and appropriate distribution of the resultant audit report;and (6) Audit resolution policies and procedures to be followed in resolvingthe audit report.F. <T3>Fund Suspension or Termination.</T3> If, after notice and opportunityfor a hearing, the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programsfinds that a State has failed to substantially comply with the Victimsof Crime Act, M7100.1, these proposed implementing Guidelines, or any implementingregulation, the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programsmay suspend or terminate funding to the State, or take other appropriateaction. Only States may request a hearing; Subgrantees in the State maynot.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Additional Requirements</ITAG>A. <T3>Civil Rights</T3>(1) <T3>General.</T3> The Act provides that no person shall be excluded fromparticipation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination under,or denied employment in connection with any activity receiving funds underthe Act on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap,or sex. (See Section 1407(e) of the Act.) Recipients of funds under theAct are also subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d (prohibiting discrimination in Federally-funded programs on the basisof race, color, or national origin), Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, 2 U.S.C. 794 (prohibiting discrimination in such programson the basis of handicap), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C.6101, <T3>et seq., </T3>and the Department of Justice Nondiscrimination Regulations,28 CFR Part 42, Subparts C, D, and G.(2) <T3>Required Assistance and Information.</T3> To be eligible for fundingunder the Act, a crime victim assistance program must submit the followingassurances and information:(a) An assurance that the program will comply with all applicable nondiscriminationrequirements;(b) An assurance that in the event a Federal or state court or Federalor state administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination aftera due process hearing, on the grounds of race, color, religion, nationalorigin, sex, age or handicap against the program, the program will forwarda copy of the finding to the Office of Justice Programs, Office for CivilRights (OCR);(c) The name of the civil rights contact person who has lead responsibilityin ensuring that all applicable civil rights requirements are met and whoshall act as liaison in civil rights matters with OCR;(d) An assurance that programs will maintain information on victim servicesprovided by race, national origin, sex, age and handicap. Note: Statesare not required to submit this information as part of their program performancereport.B. <T3>Confidentiality of Research Information.</T3> No recipient of moniesunder the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, shall use or revealany research or statistical information furnished under this program byany person and identifiable to any specific private person for any purposeother than the purpose for which such information was obtained in accordancewith this program and Act. Such information shall be immune from legalprocess and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishing suchinformation, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action,suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding. (Seesection 1407(d) of the Act.) This provision is intended, among other things,to assure the confidentiality of information provided by crime victimsto crisis intervention counselors working for victim services programsreceiving funds provided under this Act. Whatever the scope of applicationgiven this provision, it is clear that there is nothing in the Act or itslegislative history to indicate that Congress intended to override or repeal,in effect, a State's existing law governing the disclosure of informationwhich is supportive of the Act's fundamental goal of helping crime victims.For example, this provision would not act to override or repeal, in effect,a State's existing law pertaining to the mandatory reporting of suspectedchild abuse.
