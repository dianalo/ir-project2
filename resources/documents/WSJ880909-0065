From his Labor Day kickoff in Detroit to a speech before college students in suburban New Jersey to his appearance before war veterans here yesterday, Mr. Dukakis spent the first week of the general-election campaign courting middle-class voters and railing against the &quot;squeeze&quot; on middle-class wage-earners.    These voters, most of whom are as unfamiliar with food stamps as they are with zero-coupon bonds, plainly if predictably emerged as the target of the Massachusetts governor as he struggled to regain the offensive he relinquished to Vice President George Bush last month.    Both camps agree the Democratic nominee will win most of the votes in households with incomes of $20,000 or below and that Mr. Bush will win most of the votes of those who earn $50,000 or more. But recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls suggest the group in the middle is lunging from one side to the other.    Indeed, the latest Journal/NBC News poll, taken just after last month's Republican National Convention, showed Mr. Bush leading this group, which comprises just under half the electorate, by a 51%-to-39% margin. In the poll taken two weeks earlier, Mr. Dukakis held a 49%-to-41% lead among these voters.    The Democrats have forfeited the White House in recent years because they've lost the mass in the middle. &quot;The reason middle-class voters pulled back from the Democrats in 1980 and 1984 was they believed themselves ignored by the Democrats,&quot; says Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic political pollster. &quot;The neglected middle class is looking for more than the Republican message of the pledge of allegiance and opposition to gun control. They want to be acknowledged economically.&quot;    That's precisely what Mr. Dukakis did this week. In Detroit, the governor's appeals weren't aimed just at the striving supporters of the labor movement who used to be called the &quot;working class&quot; but instead at a broader middle class that now includes many union members.    On Wednesday, he unveiled details of his plan to help finance college tuition, a classic appeal to middle-class voters who shrink before tuition bills but who, increasingly, aren't eligible for student-aid programs.    &quot;We need a president who cares when youngsters who have the energy and the ambition and the skills to go to college are denied that opportunity,&quot; he said in a speech in Union, N.J., &quot;because their parents are being victimized by Republican economic policies that leave the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer and those in the middle -- and that means most of us -- being squeezed.&quot;    The education plan, which would provide federal guarantees for private loans to be repaid by future payroll withholding, addresses a fundamental financial worry facing middle-class families. In his speech at Kean College of New Jersey, Mr. Dukakis said the proposal was aimed at &quot;millions of youngsters from middle-income families who are not eligible for grants and loans today, or who choose not to take advantage of loans because they don't want to start out in life burdened by tens of thousands of dollars of debt.&quot;    He applied the &quot;squeeze&quot; language to nearly every setting -- recognition of the economic pressures on middle-class families that require two wage-earners to keep up, and then only barely.    But with the economy looking strong on the surface at least, Mr. Dukakis must persuade people that they don't have it as good as they think, and that tough economic times lie ahead.    &quot;Weekly paychecks have failed to keep up with inflation since 1981 and the things people need most -- housing, health care, a college education -- have all risen even faster,&quot; says Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist who has been advising Mr. Dukakis.    The result is that, ever so subtly, the Democratic Party is revising its rhetoric to reflect one of the most striking demographic changes of the past quarter-century, the growth in the share of the population that regards itself as middle class.    &quot;A huge majority of people now think of themselves as middle class instead of about a third,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political pollster. &quot;That's the reason some of the older Democratic messages -- the talk about the working class or the working poor -- don't ring true anymore, and Dukakis is adjusting to that.&quot;    Not everyone is convinced that the Massachusetts governor is going to sway these middle-class voters. &quot;Ask people if they're better off than they were eight years ago, and you'll see that Bush can win a majority of middle-class voters,&quot; contends Lawrence Lindsey, a Harvard economist who advises the vice president. &quot;It's silly to argue otherwise.&quot;    Though political analysts agree that Mr. Dukakis has made a sensible political calculation, they also agree that his campaign still faces formidable challenges. Although he spoke this week of &quot;an America that is so strong that no nation can challenge us, so productive that no nation can compete with us, so true to its purpose that no force on this earth can divide us,&quot; he has yet to project a compelling vision to the middle-class voter.    His responses to the parries of politics, moreover, are often technical and sometimes sterile. His answer to the vice president's charges about the pollution in Boston Harbor revolves around sewer grants. His answer to a Philadelphia voter's concerns Monday about the homeless centered on his proposal for &quot;a national partnership for affordable housing {to} really get this country back in the business of building housing for low and moderate-income people.&quot;    The elements are there, however, especially when Mr. Dukakis mixes his appeal to the middle-class voter with allusions to the richness of Americans' ethnic heritage and the endurance of middle-class values. His audiences often respond warmly when he invokes the imagery of a nation that is &quot;a wonderful and diverse mosaic of races and creeds and ethnic groups bound together by our love for this country, by our belief in its future, and by our deep and abiding faith in the American dream.&quot;    There were hints of it Tuesday, when this son of Greek immigrants whose mother came to America on a coal ship called Polonia appeared in a Polish hall in Niles Township, Ill. There a rabbi gave the invocation, a man held a Dukakis sign written in Greek, someone yelled &quot;Viva America&quot; from the back of the room and Mr. Dukakis told his listeners he would ensure that the middle class has access to &quot;jobs you can count on, jobs you can support a family on, jobs with a future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
