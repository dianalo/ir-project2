The shootingsare similar to slayings in Ardmore, Okla., and Pampa, Texas, inwhich another suspect has been charged.

He hadbeen considered a prime suspect in the Kansas slayings beforeBraun's arrest.   Asked if Greene remained a suspect in the slayings, Wojdylaksaid only that ``the scope of the investigation is not limited toMr. Braun.''   Asked if there was any connection between the two men, Wojdylaksaid, ``That's why we're continuing our investigation. ... We needto see if there is a possible link.''   Wojdylak said he would release no information about ballisticstests conducted in New Mexico on a .25-caliber handgun found inBraun's car when he was arrested at a roadblock Sunday nearCimarron, N.M. The five victims in four states were all believed tohave been killed with a .25-caliber gun.

Braun was arraigned in Raton, N.M., Monday on a murder charge inthe death of Geraldine Valdez, 48, a Springer convenience storeclerk who was shot twice in the head.   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon reported today that employees ofthe Grain Bin, a Garden City nightclub, knew both Greene and Braun,but there was no immediate indication the two men knew each other.   Braun had been a maintenance employee at the S-Bar Ranch FeedYard near Garden City. Feed Yard manager Galen Wright said Brauncame to work Thursday, the day after the Garden City slayings,picked up his paycheck and said he wouldn't be back.   Greene had been staying at the Wheat Lands Motor Inn this monthin Garden City but left without paying a $295 bill, motel officialssaid.   Part of the bill was for drinks at the Grain Bin, which isaffiliated with the motel. Motel officials said they moved hisbelongings out of his room July 17, two days before the killings.   Greene was arrested without incident Sunday when he soughttreatment for a back injury at a Lawton, Okla., hospital.
