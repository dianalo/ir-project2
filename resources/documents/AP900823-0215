The idea of the consultations is apparently an attempt at acompromise between those countries which want an emergency meetingof all the cartel's members and those which do not.   On Monday, OPEC announced that there was no majority support fora Saudi Arabian request to call an urgent meeting.   Word of the possible informal meeting came Wednesday as theprice of oil on world markets climbed to levels not seen since themid-80s. In crude-oil trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange,for example, prices surged over the $31 a barrel level, a 72percent gain since the crisis erupted Aug. 2.   Indonesia has proposed the meeting in Vienna for Sunday, saidsources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The sources stressed that no final decision has yet been made onwhether to meet.   ``It may or may not be held,'' said one source. ``If it is, itwill be very, very informal.'' No decisions could be made at thegathering, he said.   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said last Saturdaythat his country intended to increase oil production by 2 millionbarrels a day with or without OPEC's approval. The increase wouldmake up about half of the loss of some 4 million barrels a daycaused by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil thatfollowed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   Nazer had urged the cartel to hold an emergency session todiscuss the situation. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Venezuelaand Ecuador were said to support his plea.   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, said he opposed anemergency meeting because there was enough crude in storage to makeup for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.   Under the Indonesia proposal, the sources said Iran, SaudiArabia, Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela would gather forthe informal talks.   Those nations represent two committees recently set up by thecartel to monitor oil production.   In its statement Monday, OPEC said Algerian Mining MinisterSadek Boussena, the cartel's president, would hold consultationswith some ministers before the end of the month. It did notelaborate.   Meanwhile, industry sources in Venezuela said Wednesday thatcountry was accelerating plans to boost oil production by at least300,000 barrels daily, and filling its storage facilities at homeand overseas to have extra output available as soon as authoritiesallow more production.   Venezuela, whose OPEC quota is about 1.9 million barrels a day,has been lobbying for a formal OPEC meeting to sanction increasedoutput.   Saudi Arabia, which pumps about a quarter of the cartel's oil,has an OPEC-set production quota of just under 5.4 million barrelsa day.   At their summer conference last month, OPEC ministers agreed tolimit their output to 22.5 million barrels a day in the last halfof the year to try to push crude prices up to $21 a barrel.   With the gulf crisis, the average price of a basket of crudesmonitored by the group surged last week to $25.29 a barrel.   The next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduleduntil mid-December.</TEXT></DOC>
