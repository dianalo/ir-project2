<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0681 </DOCNO><TEXT>The design of pulse programs for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experimentsis tedious and complex, requiring a deep understanding of the interactionsthat exist between magnetic fields generated during an MRI experiment.This paper describes an intelligent system that understands how to constructthe multichannel temporal sequences of pulses needed to control an MRIexperiment. PUPA, the PUlse Programmers Assistant, provides assistanceto a relatively naive user of MRI systems. Knowledge is coded in theform of rules and semantic networks. A natural language facility andmenu system are provided for communication with the user.</TEXT></DOC>
