And Britain confirmed its earlier decision to raise the limit on foreign shareholdings in jet-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce PLC by a similar amount.    The move followed pressure from the European Community Commission, which argued that the government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings breached provisions in the EC's Treaty of Rome outlawing restrictions on foreign investment except in cases of national security.    The EC Commission last month reached a compromise with Britain to allow the 29.5% limit on foreign shareholdings in Rolls-Royce, although commissioners said they continued to believe the limit is against EC rules. The commission said at the time that it was dealing with the British Aerospace separately, but British government sources had indicated the Rolls-Royce limit would apply to British Aerospace. </TEXT></DOC>
