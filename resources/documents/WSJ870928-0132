The U.S. Congress is expected to consider banning imports of South African minerals, the country's second largest source of foreign exchange. But market analysts and industry executives here appear confident that the minerals' strategic importance ensures them of continued strong world demand.    Many of them also predict that an import ban won't be enacted or will prove difficult to enforce if it is. Samancor, a major exporter of such strategic minerals as manganese and chromium, recently hit a record price of 10 rand ($4.88) a share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, almost double its 1986 low of 5.15. Samancor closed Friday at 9.70.    Another minerals concern, Highveld Steel andamp; Vanadium, closed Friday at 7.30, compared with a low of 4.90 in January.    The U.S.'s anti-apartheid measure, passed in August 1986, bans imports of South African products including coal, textiles, clothing, agricultural goods, iron, steel, sugar, gold coins and uranium. The act provides for possible additional sanctions if South Africa hasn't made substantial progress toward ending its system of racial separation and white-minority rule by next month.    Possible penalties include banning South African diamond imports; barring U.S. banks from accepting, receiving or holding deposit accounts of South African nationals; prohibiting military assistance to nations evading an embargo on arms and military technology to South Africa; and banning imports of South African strategic minerals.    South African exports of these minerals totaled 25.2 billion rand last year, placing them second only to gold as a foreign-exchange source. South Africa is the world's largest producer of chromium ore, ferrochromium and vanadium and is second to the Soviet Union in production of manganese ore and platinum. Its reserves of platinum and manganese ore are believed to far exceed those of the Soviet Union.    Minerals accounted for about 80% of South Africa's $655 million of exports to the U.S. in the first half of 1987. Platinum accounted for more than half, at $338 million.    Samancor, the Western world's largest producer of chrome ore, ferrochrome and manganese ore and one of the largest producers of manganese alloys, would stand to lose substantial business from sanctions, as exports accounted for 80% of turnover in its latest fiscal year.    However, a spokesman says the company believes that its products, which have extensive military and industrial uses, are mostly immune to boycotts and sanctions.    &quot;I'm not saying we're feeling comfortable about the possibility of sanctions,&quot; he says, &quot;but we're not feeling too threatened either. We're a very big supplier, and the U.S. is dependent on our supplies to a large extent.&quot;    The Chamber of Mines, which represents South Africa's six major mining houses, declines to comment officially. But it recently published an article quoting a U.S. State Department report as saying that in 1985, South Africa accounted for 73% of U.S. imports of chromium, 32% of manganese, 46% of the platinum group of metals and 40% of vanadium.    Most mining analysts on the Johannesburg exchange doubt that the U.S. will impose the minerals sanctions.    If it does, analyst Rodney Yaldwin of the brokerage firm Simpson McKie and many others say, the measures may cause direct trade to fall, but the products will almost certainly continue to reach many U.S. users through third parties.    Another analyst, Derek Ritchie of the Fergusson Brothers brokerage firm says, &quot;There are hosts of middlemen throughout the world who are willing to make money by helping South Africa avoid sanctions.&quot;    He cites the case of neighboring Zimbabwe, which faced sanctions on its mineral exports when it was known as Rhodesia and was ruled by a white minority.    &quot;Rhodesian chromium was still exported all over the world,&quot; he says.    ---   World Market Activity   Tokyo stocks surged in Saturday's halfday session as buying was encouraged by the start of trading for the October monthly account.    The Nikkei stock index soared 416.93 points to 25512.79 after rising 150.98 Friday. The first-section index rose 52 to 2114.10 Saturday after rising 13.65 Friday. Volume totaled about 1.2 billion shares, up from about 945 million shares Friday.    Electrical issues rose across the board. Other gainers included precision-instrument, bank, securities and non-life insurance stocks, as well as real estate, printing, transport and pharmaceutical issues.    Food stocks fell, though, and ceramic and some machine tool issues weakened.    London issues ended higher Friday as a surge in the final 90 minutes of trading lifted prices to their highs for the day.    The 100-share index rose 29.2 points to 2342.6, and the Financial Times 30-share index rose 19.7 to 1831.6. Volume was 751.1 million shares, the highest total in two weeks and up from 616 million shares Thursday.    The market's strength surprised dealers after Thursday's report of a record merchandise trade deficit for August knocked the 100-share index down 39 points.    British Petroleum rose 5 to 374 pence ($6.14) a share. The company issued a preliminary prospectus for its planned public offering next month, and its 1987 profit forecast in the document was broadly in line with expectations.    Most drug stocks had good gains. Saatchi andamp; Saatchi fell 10 to 550, and Unigate fell 11 to 362. The two companies are being dropped from London's 100-share index, starting Thursday. RMC Group, which also will be dropped, rose 15 to 499 in continued reaction to Thursday's report of higher first-half earnings.    British Printing andamp; Communication fell 4 to 360. Chairman Robert Maxwell proposed renaming the company Maxwell Communication.    Elsewhere, shares closed at another record high in Hong Kong and rose in Sydney, Singapore and Milan, fell in Paris and Frankfurt and were mixed in Zurich and Amsterdam. Priin Brussels and Sckholm were mixed to lower.    Here are price trends o world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Sanley Cl International Pspective, Geneva.
