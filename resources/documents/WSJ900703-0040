Rockwell International Corp.'s Rocketdyne division, thePratt andamp; Whitney division of United Technologies Corp., andAerojet, GenCorp's aerospace segment, said the team approachwas requested by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, the government agency overseeing the enginedevelopment program.</LP><TEXT>   Rocketdyne's project marketing manager, David Wright, saidthat the team might become effective as early as Oct. 1 if anagreement can be reached on melding the companies' nineexisting contracts for the project's initial phase. The nexttwo phases, which he valued at $600 million to $700 millionover five to six years, would begin in October 1991.   The companies said they will design an engine using liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants with a 580,000-poundthrust level. The new engine would be the first significantadvance in rocket engine technology since the early 1970s, aRocketdyne spokeswoman said.</TEXT></DOC>
