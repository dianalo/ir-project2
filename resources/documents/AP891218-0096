The 5-foot birds with snow-white plumes flocked from WoodBuffalo National park in Alberta, Canada, to the Austwell refugealong the Texas coast. Last year's flock consisted of 138 cranes.   The whooping crane population has increased almost tenfold sincea low point in 1941, when 14 birds and two chicks were spotted onrefuge land. Since then, the population has slowly increased.   Bird watchers and biologists credit public awareness andprotection of natural habitats in Canada and Texas with helping tonurture the flock.   President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized creations of theAransas National Wildlife Refuge in 1936 when it was discoveredonly 14 adult cranes and four chicks were left in the species. Italso was discovered then that the Texas peninsula, covered withblackjack oaks, was the birds' only known winter feeding area.</TEXT></DOC>
