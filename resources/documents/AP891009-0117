He retired 12 generals, including deputy army commander JorgeZincke, and promoted seven officers to general rank. Chosen toreplace Zincke was Gen. Jorge Lucar Figueroa, now barrackscommander for Santiago, the capital.   Gen. Pinochet's changes were part of an annual restructuring ofthe army leadership.   Since losing a referendum Oct. 5, 1988, on extending his rule to1997, Pinochet has reduced the number of generals from 56 to 43.Pinochet has been army commander since shortly before the uprisingin September 1973 that ousted President Salvador Allende, an avowedMarxist who died in the coup.   The referendum defeat obliged Pinochet to schedule the Decemberelections for a civilian government to be inaugurated March 11.   Reduction in the number of top officers appears designed to helpease the military's departure from major government posts and itsreturn to the barracks.   Pinochet, 73, has said he will remain as army commander underthe new government. The 1980 constitution, written by hisadministration, allows him and the navy, air force and nationalpolice commanders to keep their jobs until 1998.  </TEXT></DOC>
