In other cases, Palestinian children under 13, whom the law doesnot consider legally responsible for their acts, are held for daysbecause their parents can't pay bail, said attorney Shlomo Lecker.   Lecker said an 11-year-old and two 13-year-olds were detained forfive days each in a cell at Jerusalem police headquarters becausetheir parents could not come up with $415 bail.   ``They are held eight to a cell, and it's dark,'' Lecker said,adding that his young clients have complained of being slapped inthe face and kicked in the legs during interrogation.   Dorit Beinish, a state attorney in the Justice Ministry, defendedthe practice as legal.   ``We have many cases of stone-throwing by minors. This is a newcrime, part of the uprising, and punishments are more severe,'' shesaid in an interview.   Ms. Beinish said she did not recall a case in which a youth washeld without bail and later acquitted.   Ms. Beinish also said she did not know of Palestinians under 13being held. ``If this happened, it was a mistake,'' she said.   Police spokeswoman Nurit Buton said she would investigateLecker's allegations that children under 13 have been held.   Asked about the charges of mistreatment during interrogation, shesaid each complaint was investigated by a special police unit. ``Wehave many complaints that have no basis at all, while in some casesthere may be something to it,'' she said.   Nine left-wing Israeli legislators have written a letter toJustice Minister Dan Meridor asking that the practice of holdingminors be stopped.   ``Standards from the West Bank are coming to Israel,'' said DediZucker, a legislator from the Citizens Rights Movement. He spoke inan interview Thursday.   Lecker said the practice began a year ago after the Supreme Courtruled that minors _ those between the ages of 14 and 18 _ can beheld without bail until the start of trial if they are charged withthrowing stones.   On Thursday, Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-oldPalestinian in clashes near the West Bank villages of Fahme and KfarRai, the army said. Hospital officials identified the youth as AhmedJamil Saabneh, and gave his age as 22.   The death brought to 371 the number of Palestinians killed in theuprising. Fifteen Israelis also have been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
