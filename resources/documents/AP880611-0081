At least one black man, a supporter of Tutu, was taken intocustody, and police ordered all members of the public to leave themain hall at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport.   About 100 of Tutu's supporters remained in the hall and chantedthe archbishop's name when he arrived on a connecting flight fromCape Town.   Police and clergymen escorted Tutu and his wife, Leah, throughthe hall as his supporters, most of them black, cheered. Many whiteonlookers stared in amazement.   He gave a final wave to the crowd before entering theinternational departure area to catch a flight to London. He is tofly to Moscow on Sunday to join ecumenical celebrations of the1,000th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church.   About 15 anti-Tutu protesters _ including a few blacks and awhite woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishop'scostume _ assembled at Jan Smuts with placards denouncing thearchbishop's support for sanctions against South Africa. One postertermed Tutu ``Moscow's Puppet,'' while another said: ``Red Carpetfor Tutu _ Red Bombs for Us.''   It was the fourth airport protest against Tutu since he returnedthree weeks ago from a trip to Europe and the United States. Duringthat trip, he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against SouthAfrica as a means of promoting racial reform.   Saturday marked the first time during the series of proteststhat anti-Tutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of thearchbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fightagainst South Africa's policy of white domination.   The altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed ananti-Tutu poster and tore it. Police announced over the publicaddress system that the arrival hall should be vacated, but manypeople _ including members of the rival protest groups _ remained.   When Tutu arrived, about 45 minutes after the scuffle, one womancursed him but few of his other critics were visible.   Participants in the earlier anti-Tutu protests have includedwhites from right-wing organizations and jobless blacks recruitedby conservative black politicians. All the protests have beenfilmed and shown on the national television news by the state-runSouth African Broadcasting Corp., which frequently denounces Tutu.   Tutu has described sanctions as one of the few non-violent meansof pressuring the government to end apartheid, under which SouthAfrica's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.Sanctions could be avoided, he says, if the government dismantledapartheid and moved to grant the black majority full politicalrights.   Tutu's critics contend that sanctions will result in higherblack unemployment while hardening the attitudes of pro-apartheidwhites.   These critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions, but thereis no means of verifying this. Endorsement of sanctions is illegalunder emergency regulations, and blacks are not allowed to vote innational elections or referendums.   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary general of the South AfricanCouncil of Churches, said this week that the anti-Tutu protestswere being ``orchestrated ... to give the impression that there wasmounting protest against anti-apartheid groups.''</TEXT></DOC>
