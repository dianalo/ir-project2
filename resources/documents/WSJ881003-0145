Says It's 'On Target' for Goal Of 10% to 15% Profit Growth for 1988 </HL><AUTHOR> Mary Lu Carnevale (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UNC PTCM </CO><IN> TEL TNM CEO </IN><DATELINE> ANNAPOLIS, Md.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   UNC Inc. is &quot;on target&quot; to meet its goal of 10% to 15% profit growth for continuing operations this year, Dan Colussy, president and chief executive officer, said.    Those results would exclude a significant one-time gain anticipated in the 1988 fourth quarter from the sale of the company's TRT Communications unit, Mr. Colussy indicated.    &quot;We've set an informal goal of 10% to 15% growth in earnings per share,&quot; Mr. Colussy said in an interview. &quot;It's not an easy task, but that's the general direction&quot; the company is pursuing since its restructuring began in 1984, he said. &quot;We're on target.&quot; He declined to be more specific, citing variables regarding the TRT sale.    For 1987, the maker of aviation and aerospace equipment and parts reported that earnings from continuing operations grew 30% to $9 million, or 56 cents a share, on sales of $495.9 million. Earnings from discontinued operations of $1.9 million and a benefit from tax-loss carry-forwards of $7.2 million produced net income of $18.1 million, or $1.12 a share.    For the first six months of this year, the company is well ahead of the 1987 pace, having earned $6.2 million, or 37 cents a share, from continuing operations.    Mr. Colussy said UNC wants to concentrate on its aviation and aerospace operations and environmental services. Its business of manufacturing reactor propulsion units and other parts for U.S. Navy nuclear submarines isn't expected to show much growth until the early 1990s, when the Navy's SSN-21 program goes into service.    Mr. Colussy said the planned sale of TRT Communications to Pacific Telecom Inc. for about $95 million will reduce UNC's debt as a percentage of total capitalization to about 50%. At the end of June, the proportion was about 61%. UNC expects Federal Communications Commission approval of the transaction by Dec. 31.    Mr. Colussy said the company decided to sell TRT after it failed to find reasonably priced companies that could enhance TRT's world-wide telecommunications services. TRT, which UNC acquired in October 1985 for $57 million, last year contributed $140.2 million, or 28%, of UNC's revenue.    While the company is interested in acquisitions within its current lines of business, Mr. Colussy said management has no plans to dilute earnings. One promising area, he said, is environmental services. To build business, the company is applying its expertise in handling radioactive wastes to address other environmental problems.    Its UNC Geotech unit has a $215 million Defense Department contract to eliminate contamination of houses and buildings builtin Grand Junction, Colo., atop of uranium tailings.    UNC also is pulling from mothballs a technology and some facilities developed in the 1970s to extract uranium. The technology is now being applied to remove heavy metals, such as chromium, titanium and cobalt from waste streams produced by electroplating and other manufacturing operations.    UNC also wants to expand its niche markets in aviation and aerospace. Earlier this year, it expanded its lightweight aerospace products technology with the acquisition of Alloy Spot Welders of West Los Angeles. Mr. Colussy predicted strong growth for UNC's business of repairing and reconditioning aircraft parts as commercial and military buyers trim costs. </TEXT></DOC>
