The possible purchases under discussion with Bush administrationofficials are bound to touch off a row with Israel's supporters.Saudi Arabia, for instance, might get 315 Abrams tanks, probably thebest in the world, and the United Arab Emirates 40 jet fighters.   The list is far from final. It's only a wish list _ what theoil-rich Arab countries and other potential customers would like tobuy. Reaction to the soundings that began last Friday on CapitolHill could force changes before the White House makes formalrequests for approval.   In the meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir hasunveiled a proposal to extend autonomy _ but not statehood _ toPalestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.   The plan was rejected outright by the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which is gaining diplomatic support in Western Europeand apparently sees no reason to compromise on its demand for astate carved out of Israeli-held territory.   Shamir also has not engendered any enthusiasm from the Bushadministration despite his offer to withdraw troops from some of thepopulation centers on the West Bank and in Gaza once Palestiniansthere accept autonomy. The State Department simply has had nothingto say about the offer.   In the Camp David agreements 10 years ago, the United States,Israel and Egypt called for autonomy for the Palestinians. Afterfive years of managing their own local affairs, negotiations wouldbe opened for a permanent arrangement. All options, includingstatehood, would be on the table.   The idea was to see how living together would work, but Egypt wasostracized for approving something less than immediate statehood forthe Palestinians and the plan never got off the ground.   If the Bush administration has another approach in mind it hasnot tipped its hand, although Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIruled out U.S. support for an independent Palestinian state at hisSenate confirmation hearing.   The classified arms list under discussion in Capitol Hillcorridors and over lunches reflects a traditional U.S. approach oftrying to lubricate Middle East diplomacy with weapons.   A copy obtained Thursday by The Associated Press showed Israelunder consideration for 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, fourhelicopters and some new radar and equipment for its jet fighters.   The potential Arab purchases have far more punch.   Kuwait, a wealthy Arab state, could receive 200 Abrams tanks,known also as the M1A1 and considered by experts to be the best inthe world.   Other key items include 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles withan infrared guidance system and electronic warfare gear for Bahrainand 24 F-16 jet fighters and 100 Mavericks and 100 Sidewinderair-to-air missiles for Morocco.   If Bush follows through with specific requests he will have abattle on his hand. Israel's supporters are concerned that Arabweapons could be turned against the Jewish state in a Middle Eastconflict.   Congress has the power to block a purchase, but only if amajority of both the Senate and the House reject a White Houseproposal.   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, declined toidentify any of the weapons under consideration. He stressed it wasnot a ``sale plan,'' but rather the administration's ``bestestimate'' of other countries' weapons needs.   ``Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' Redmansaid.   Israel's supporters were successful during the Carter and Reaganadministration in blocking some U.S. sales to both Jordan and SaudiArabia.   But the skillful management of Baker, then the White House chiefof staff, and other Reagan administration operatives overcamestubborn resistance in 1981 to the sale of Awacs radar planes toSaudi Arabia which the Senate approved 52-48.   The White House, in a cover letter, informed Congress the Saudiswere in the process of deciding whether to request U.S. or Europeanfighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade, the sourcessaid.   The letter said the Saudis were considering jet fighters to bejointly produced by Britain and West Germany and the French Mirage4000, as well as U.S.-built F-16s and F-18s.   Besides the Abrams tanks, on the list for the Saudis were sevenmultiple-launch artillery rocket systems, for battlefield use, andseven of the box-type rockets for Kuwait along with 1,500 Towanti-tank missiles.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid heads the AP's State Departmentstaff.</TEXT></DOC>
