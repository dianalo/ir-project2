In the case of myocardial infarct the stress EKG andthe heart scintigraphy agree with one another to a large degree, wherebyscintigraphy (with 99mTc-DPTA) in addition detects infarcted myocardialregions. In the diagnosis of heart wall aneurysms scintigraphy and ventriculographyhad the same results in 91.6% of the cases. Coronary heart disease resultsagreed for all three methods in 91.7% of the cases and with scintigraphyand angiography in 94.4%. The degree of agreement between scintigraphyand coronary angiography is confirmed in the literature. One-, two- and3-vessel diseases can be determined with these two methods in 90 to 75%agreement. The result lies thereby above the values of 201Tl-myocardialscintigraphy given in the literature. Also the global discharge fractionshows scintigraphic as well as angiographic agreement of almost 90%.(TRV).</TEXT></DOC>
