Tridex said it will use proceeds to repay debt outstanding to Heller Financial Inc., redeem from Heller cumulative preferred shares, and buy back most of the stock purchase warrants issued to Heller under the loan agreement.    Tridex said the Cambridge connector business would be sold for more than $12.5 million, resulting in &quot;a substantial profit.&quot;    Tridex also said net income for its first quarter, ended July 1, fell to $123,000, or five cents a share, from $227,000, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped to $6.2 million from $6.4 million, mainly because of a slowdown in orders for lottery printers. The company said it expects that market to &quot;resume its growth.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
