(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers marched onto a computerizedFort Benning range Wednesday to demonstrate four of the world'smost advanced military rifles _ technology the Army hopes willdouble the combat effectiveness of U.S. troops in the 21st century.   Firing single shots and bursts, the helmeted shooters scoredhits on stationary and moving targets up to 300 meters away whileloudspeakers rattled with the sounds of returning ``enemy'' fire toheighten their stress levels.   The Army will begin seven months of tests next month to see ifnew weapons technology can help soldiers score twice as many hitson the battlefield despite fear and fast-moving targets.   Four companies have supplied prototypes for the Army's AdvancedCombat Rifle test. All the rifles fire in the semi-automatic andfully automatic modes, and three can fire three-shot burstsdesigned to overcome aiming errors.   The Colt Industries' version is derived from the M-16 but has aredesigned handguard pistol grip and an adjustable buttstock forimproved handling. It fires standard M-16 ammunition or a duplexcartridge with two rounds.   Colt says one bullet travels straight to the target; the otherdiverges slightly to improve the hit probability.   A rifle submitted by the AAI Corp. of Hunt Valley, Md., uses astandard brass cartridge, but the projectile is a steel dart knownas a ``flechette.''   Flechettes are lighter than bullets, move faster and have aflatter trajectory that makes them accurate to 600 meters, saidVernon E. Shisler, the ARC project manager, from Picatinny Arsenal,N.J.   A rifle submitted by Steyr-Mannlicher of Steyr, Austria, fires asteel flechette from a cartridge with a plastic case. Thefuturistic-looking Steyr design is shorter than conventionalmilitary rifles because its operating mechanism is in the buttstock.   The Heckler andamp; Koch prototype, resembling an elongated home videocamera, also has the mechanism in the buttstock. The West Germanrifle fires a small bullet from a rectangular ``caseless''cartridge made from molded propellant. The cartridge is about 1inch long and three-eighths of an inch square. The Handamp;K and Steyrammunition are extremely light.   Besides the prototypes, soldiers will fire M-16 rifles toprovide control data during the test.   Shisler said the new rifles are among the world's most advancedmilitary weapons and the first to include features such as multipleprojectiles and burst firing that help overcome human factors.   ``We've always wanted a weapon to be reliable, to be accurate toperform under all kinds of environments and conditions,'' he said.``These guns are more fireable. They fit the soldier better. ...What we're trying to do is help compensate for problems the shooterhas because he's scared, because he's in combat.''   The Army has spent about $40 million since 1982 on research anddevelopment and expects to spend another $17 million by 1991 whenofficials decide which technology, if any, to pursue.   If one of the designs is accepted, soldiers could have the M-16replacement as early as 1996, officials said at a briefingWednesday.   Starting Jan. 16, the rifles will be tested by teams of 18 Armyand Air Force shooters on a computerized $2.7 million range.They'll fire at moving and stationary targets from 25 to 600 metersfrom prone, standing and foxhole positions.   Another 18-member team will arrive in April. Ten female shooterswill test the weapons in August and September.   Each target has curved rods that sense the projectiles'shockwaves as they travel within 15 feet of the target. So, thecomputer not only plots the shooters' hits and displays them onvideo monitors, but also their misses.   Army officials said it's impossible to duplicate combatconditions, but shooters will feel added stress because ofinterservice rivalry and peer pressure. They'll exercise beforefiring and wear heart monitors during the tests.   Army tests indicate an M-16 rifle fired under ideal conditionscan hit 300 meter targets whenever the trigger is pulled. The hitprobability at the same distance drops to about 65 percent duringmarksmanship training.   ``The M-16 was a fine weapon. It's reliable and accurate. Itranks among the best,'' Shisler said. ``In combat, soldiers arefrightened and don't have time to aim. Our goal is to increasetheir effectiveness.''</TEXT></DOC>
