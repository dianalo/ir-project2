That's the forecast of an East-West think tank in Vienna after a four-year study of the potential impact of the so-called greenhouse effect on the world's agriculture. Summaries of the study, made for the United Nations Environment Program, were released in Vienna early this morning and made available in New York by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. The institute is a nongovernment organization of scientific academies and institutes in 16 countries including the U.S. and the Soviet Union.    The institute's study is the latest of several recent reports on the likelihood that the Earth's climate is warming because of a rising concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases in the atmosphere. These trace gases, the result of human activities such as the burning of coal and oil, are slowing the escape of heat from the Earth's sun-warmed surface to outer space. The result is much like that of a greenhouse, which is kept warm by its glass panes trapping the sun's heat.    Scientists are predicting that the climate, which currently has an average temperature of about 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit), will warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) in the next 35 years and by 5.5 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next 100 years. Some researchers argue such warming already has begun.    The institute, which is based in Vienna, asked 76 scientists in 17 countries to take a detailed look at what is likely to happen to agriculture in 11 representative regions of the world as the climate warms. The scientists first studied the impact of weather extremes on agriculture during the years 1951-1980. They then used a U.S.-developed model of predicted weather changes that would result if atmospheric carbon dioxide is double the levels that existed before the Industrial Revolution. From these &quot;models&quot; the researchers painted scenarios of what might happen to agriculture in a warmer world.    &quot;The climate of Finland is estimated to become similar to that of northern Germany,&quot; the researchers predicted. The Leningrad area will become more like the western Ukraine while the central Ural mountains in the U.S.S.R. will be more like south central Norway. Southern Saskatchewan in Canada will be like northern Nebraska is at present.    A temperature rise in the Moscow region will mean &quot;the area of winter wheat, maize and vegetables would expand while the area of . . . spring-sown barley, oats and potatoes would reduce,&quot; the report predicted. By switching to winter-sown wheat in areas that currently grow spring-sown wheat and by increasing fertilizer use, the Russians could boost their wheat and rye crops by 49%, the study predicted. The Leningrad area could replace the Ukraine as the Russian granary, it noted.    For North America, the researchers focused on Saskatchewan in the northern Great Plains. Without an increase in rainfall, the higher temperatures will increase water evaporation, reducing yields of the spring-sown wheat that is currently the dominant crop. Yields could be as low as in 1933-1937, the driest five-year period on record. A switch to winter-sown wheat, which is well established by May or June and thus less vulnerable to the expected dry summers, would partially offset the weather change.    For Japan as well as northern Europe, Finland and the Scandinavian countries the warmer climate and longer growing seasons will mean higher crop yields and increasing problems of farm surpluses.    The semiarid regions of Brazil, Australia, India and Africa, however, will experience more frequent disastrous droughts such as that of 1982-1983, the report predicted. </TEXT></DOC>
