For regardless of what number risk assessmentattaches to the risk of dioxin exposure, he must still dispose of thegarbage. The &quot;public policy objective&quot; is to develop solutions to thewaste disposal problem. While an assessment of the risk of dioxin fromwaste incineration may be relevant to the selection of prudent alternatives,that assessment must be evaluated in the context of the overall policyobjective.
