They haveoperated for pulse length up to 1 s and have achieved their design powerlevel of 1.5 MW each. The design principles and the characteristics ofthe antenna are described. In order to be able to operate with increasedheating powers and pulse lengths most components inside the ASDEX vesseland the ASDEX ICRF antennae have to be cooled. For the antennae of thissecond phase, the underlying design criteria, the results of the thermaland mechanical calculations and the various manufacturing steps are presented.First tests on the thermal loading capabilities of the screen are included.</TEXT></DOC>
