WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Saturday urgedrejection of ideologies and respect for human rights as he came tothis poor Marxist-oriented country on his African pilgrimage.   The pontiff said the church realized the difficulties of tryingto find the best political system to improve living conditions inGuinea-Bissau, one of the world's 15 poorest countries.   The average life expectency in this former Portuguese colony onthe West African coast is 39, the lowest in the world, and annualper capita income is around $190.   In an airport speech after his arrival on the second leg of hiseight-day tour of the Sahel region, the pope said the ``pillars ofa truly human model of society'' should be freedom, justice andfundamental rights.   The pope criticized education based on ideology. Vaticanofficials said this was in reference to complaints by the localchurch that the one-party state imposes Marxist-oriented teachingin schools.   John Paul said education should be ``global,'' cautioningagainst teaching that turns students into objects and leads them to``uncontrolled productionism, guided only by national interests''   ``In such cases, you run the risk of evasion and the search forescape, perhaps in violence, with all its evils,'' he said,speaking in Portuguese.   ``I pray that the education process here has complete success,starting with a real literacy campaign.''   The pope arrived in Bissau in sunshine and sweltering heat, astriking contrast with the rain and wind that marked his two daysin the barren Cape Verde islands.   The pope later addressed clergy in the Bissau cathedral andcelebrated Mass at the Sept. 24 stadium, named after the date in1973 when the country gained independence.   In his homily during the Mass, John Paul made another referenceto Marxist ideology, saying people should be spared from``everything which seeks to crush or eliminate them in theanonymity of collectivity.''   He said the local church promotes ``the fundamental rights ofman'' and rejection ``of static and conditioning ideologies.''   ``Be vigilant and don't let yourselves be won over by thetemptations of corruption and abuse of power and wealth,'' he toldthe faithful.   Touching on a common theme of his papacy, John Paul warnedagainst materialism, consumerism and forms of development that``favor a mere expansion of technologies for economic growth.''   Despite the church-state dispute over education, the governmentof President Joao Bernado Vieira, who took power in a 1980 coup,has sought to shed some of its Marxist practices.   It has liberalized the economy, lifting price controls and traderestrictions at the behest of the World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund.   In its latest report, the human rights organization AmnestyInternational accused the government of holding about 30 politicalprisoners in connection with an alleged 1985 plot to overthrowVieira. The report said they had received an unfair trial.   In what was seen as a gesture to the pope, the government lastweek freed 16 people who were convicted in the alleged conspiracy.   Six others convicted in the same case were executed in July1986, despite pleas for clemency from the pope and others.   Guinea-Bissau, sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea on theAtlantic coast, is one of the smallest countries in Africa,covering 14,000 square miles.   About 7 percent of the population of 950,000 is Roman Catholic.More than 50 percent are animists and one-third are Moslems.   The pope leaves Sunday for Mali, then heads to Burkina Faso andChad.</TEXT></DOC>
