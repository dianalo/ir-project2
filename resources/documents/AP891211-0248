The agency proposed a week ago to halt the use of EBDCs on 45food products, including tomatoes, potatoes, bananas and lettuce.   Critics of the plans say it will boost consumer food prices andcause hardships for growers.   Used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew, thepesticides _ which include some such as Maneb and Zineb familiar tohome gardners _ have been linked to cancer.   Although hailed by the Bush administration as a move to protectconsumers, the EPA announcement is producing some concerns as itgradually sinks in.   For example, Rep. Charles Hatcher, D-Ga., chairman of the HouseAgriculture subcommittee on domestic marketing, consumer relationsand nutrition, has been contacted by farm groups in Georgia who areconcerned about the planned curb on EBDCs.   Press Secretary Krista Harden said Hatcher is consulting with astate coalition that has formed around the EBDC issue and may holdhearings on the subject when Congress returns in January.   ``The ban is too severe,'' said Lowell Peavy, owner of PeavyFarm Service in Camilla, Ga., which sells fertilizer to localfarmers. ``We fear we are going to fall in the same category as theapple people with Alar.''   Peavy said he fears area farmers will stop producing withoutEBDCs and that will hurt his fertilizer business.   The product is the main fungicide used on leafy vegetables, saidPeavy, who said it can easily be washed off.   ``But if you ate the plant without washing it you would have toeat 13,000 pounds of it to get the amount the rat had on thetest,'' said Peavy.   He said the coalition of producers and agribusinessmen he isleading, which calls itself the American Food Security Coalition,wants Congress to stop the EPA from removing EBDC from the market.   He said the group is contacting Georgia's two senators andcongressmen from farm areas.   In Idaho, where potatoes are high on the financial menu, Gov.Cecil Andrus advised his state's congressional delegation inletters that the EPA decision is causing havoc.   ``We need a competent, credible Environmental Protection Agencyto deal with the multitude of environmental concerns,'' he said.``We do not need an agncy that deals in scare tactics andmisinformation.''   Much of the EPA's case against EBDCs rests on laboratory teststhat show a byproduct of the fungicide called ETU causes cancer inanimals and likely causes cancer in humans if lifelong exposure issignificant.   Health experts say chronic exposure to EBDCs also raises therisks of birth defects or thyroid disorders.   In September, manufacturers of EBDCs announced they wouldvoluntarily halt sales of the fungicide for use on 42 food productsat the end of this year, accounting for about 40 percent to 50percent of the total sold annually.   However, EPA administrator William Reilly said on Dec. 4 thatthe voluntary ban doesn't go far enough and should be extended totomatoes, potatoes and bananas, which together account for nearlyone-third of the EBDCs used.   The Agriculture Department, nominally the governmental voice anddefender of American farmers, has been quiet since the EPAannouncement.   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter joined EPA's Reilly andHealth and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan in a statementdefending the plan to cancel some of the EBDC pesticides.   The statement expressed confidence that American consumers can``continue to eat fruits and vegetables'' without fearing thepotential risks of the chemicals, at least until an EPA marketbasket survey is completed in 1991 to determine how much of theEBDCs are potentially present.   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said Yeutter has notelaborated beyond that statement since EPA announced its plan.   Sen. Patrict Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee, called for ``a wholesale reform of our pesticide laws''instead of ``tentative half steps'' that may take years toaccomplish.   But Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, warned against a furthertightening of federal restrictions. The EPA curb on fungicides isjust a beginning, he told the state's Farm Bureau last week.   ``EPA now has a bit in its teeth, and they are running,'' hesaid. ``They will push as far as they can go, and they will test tosee how far they can push.''   The American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farmorganization, offered guarded comment. It is appropriate, saidfederation president Dean Kleckner, to review the EBDC situation,but a ban on the use of some of the fungicides would pose hardshipsfor many.   ``Crops, especially those grown in humid regions, are vulnerableto fungal diseases, such as mold, mildew, rot and scab,'' he said.``There are simply no satisfactory alternatives for many of theprescribed EBDC uses.''   Kleckner cited a recent study by GRC Economics, a Washington,D.C., consulting firm, which concluded the loss of all fungicideswould reduce fruit production by 32 percent and vegetables by 21percent. Consumer food prices would rise 13 percent, overall, thestudy said.</TEXT></DOC>
