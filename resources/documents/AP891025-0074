The document, adopted at last week's session of thepolicy-setting Central Committee and carried by Tanjug news agency,declared the party will support ``the development of politicalpluralism (and) individual rights and freedoms of individuals.''   It also called for free and democratic elections, forindependence of the judiciary and for ``guaranteeing citizens theright to form political associations and (independent) tradeunions.''   The platform, likely to be adopted at the next party congressscheduled for Jan. 20, appears to be the result of a compromisebetween Communist reformers and conservatives.   The document stopped short of advocating establishment ofopposition parties but stressed the party will support the settingup of ``citizens' political organizations ... which ensure the freecompetition of political ideas and programs.''   The platform, however, made clear the party did not ``accept thereduction of political pluralism exclusively to a multi-partysystem, as this is only one of the possible forms of politicalpluralism.''   Yugoslavia's liberal northern republic of Slovenia already hasallowed the establishment of several independent political partiesand plans to hold its first free Western-style parliamentaryelections next year.   But the largest republic, Serbia, strongly opposes multi-partydemocracy and is planning to hold its own legislative electionsnext month in which only officially sanctioned candidates will beallowed to run.   Serbia is supported in its stand by Yugoslavia's military, whoseentire officer corps is almost entirely made up of Communist Partymembers.</TEXT></DOC>
