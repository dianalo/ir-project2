Upon assuming this responsibility,FEMA in cooperation with the NRC established the regulatory foundationfor a joint FEMA/NRC Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program.This foundation consists of (1) an agreed upon working framework betweenFEMA and the NRC reflected in two separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)(see 50 FR 15485, April 18, 1985, and 45 FR 82713, December 18, 1980),(2) issuance of separate regulations by both FEMA and NRC, (3) publicationof joint FEMA/NRC planning guidance, and (4) development of a Federal RadiologicalEmergency Reponse Plan (FRERP) among FEMA, the NRC and other Federal departmentsand agencies.FEMA has the lead responsibility for review and assessment of the adequacyof offsit emergency plans developed by State and local governments or licenseesand their capability to implement such plans (e.g., adequacy and maintenanceof procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification andequipment adequacy). These assessments, findings, and determinations areused by the NRC in connection with its own licensing and regulatory responsibilitiesunder the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. FEMA will support theseassessments, findings, and determinations in the NRC licensing processand related administrative and court proceedings (See 10 CFR Part 50).Pursuant to 44 CFR Part 350, FEMA's assessments, findings, and determinationsare based upon the level of preparedness demonstrated by the plan submissionand the exercising of plans by State and local governments. The plans andexercises are evaluated under joint FEMA-NRC criteria, NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1,Rev. 1. When State and local governments do not participate in the developmentof an emergency plan, the utility can submit a utility plan to the NRC(see 10 CFR Part 50). FEMA, if requested by the NRC through the MOU, canmake an assessment, finding and determination on such utility developedplans and exercises, which shall be evaluated under joint FEMA-NRC criteria,NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, Suppl. 1. The NRC under the MOU can alsorequest from FEMA an interim finding, which represents a ``snapshot'' ofradiological emergency planning and preparedness at a specific point intime.On November 18, 1988, the President issued Executive Order 12657 (53 FR47513) ``Federal Emergency Management Agency Assistance in Emergency PreparednessPlanning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants.'' This Order was issued toensure that adequate offsite radiological emergency planning and preparednessis in place at commercial nuclear power plants to satisfy the emergencyplanning requirements of the NRC for the issuance or retention of operatinglicenses. The order applies to those situations where State and local governments,either individually or together, decline to or inadequately prepare radiologicalemergency plans to meet NRC licensing requirements or to participate adequatelyin the preparation, demonstration, testing exercise or use of such plans.44 CFR 352 provides a framework pursuant to the Executive Order for FEMAto provide Federal assistance in situations where State and local governmentsdecline to or inadequately prepare plans or participate in NRC licensingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Guidelines for Fee Development</ITAG>FEMA has developed guidelines for use in establishing a fee for individuallyidentifiable services provided to recipient licensees under the REP program.The proposed fee is based upon Title V of the Independent Offices AppropriationAct (IOAA) of 1952, 31 U.S.C. 9701, which authorizes Federal regulatoryagencies to recover to the fullest extent possible costs attributable toservices provided to identifiable recipients.FEMA proposes, that each licensee be identified as the recipient and payorof fees assessed for FEMA's services rendered on a site-specific basis.Licensees have been selected because they are the ultimate beneficiariesof FEMA's services since such services assist licensees to comply withNRC regulatory requirements. While State and/or local governments may derivesome benefit and assistance from FEMA's services, the licensees must complywith NRC regulatory requirements in order to obtain or maintain an operatinglicense from the NRC. FEMA's services convey the benefit of regulatorycompliance to the licensees, which are therefore the ultimate recipientsof FEMA services.The fees proposed will be for services that provide a special benefit tothe recipient licensees in complying with NRC statutory and regulatoryobligations. The guidelines for development of FEMA's fees are based uponthe Supreme Court decisions in <T3>National Cable Television Association, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States, et al., </T3>415 U.S. 336 (1974), and <T3>Federal Power Commission </T3>v. <T3>New England Power Company, et al., </T3>415 U.S. 345 (1974), and furtherguidance provided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit in <T3>National Cable Television Association, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F. 2d 1094 (1976); <T3>National Association of Broadcasters </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F. 2d 1118 (1976); <T3>Electronic Industries Association </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F. 2d 1109 (1976); and<T3>Capital Cities Communication, Inc., et al. </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F. 2d 1135 (1976). In summary,the guidelines provide that:1. Fees may be assessed to persons who are identifiable recipients whoderive a benefit from services conferred by FEMA in the review and approvalof site-specific offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness.This includes all services necessary for the issuance of a FEMA assessment,finding or determination, and all services provided by FEMA that are necessaryfor the recipient to comply with NRC licensing requirements.2. All direct and indirect costs incurred by FEMA in providing identificableservices to the recipient may be recovered by fees.3. It is not necessary to allocate costs in proportion to the degree ofpublic or private benefit resulting from conferring a special benefit ona recipient.4. Where the identification of the ultimate beneficiary of FEMA activityis obscure, the cost of the activity may not be included in the cost basisfor the fee.5. A fee should not exceed the sum of direct and indirect costs which FEMAincurs in furnishing the service for the recipient.6. Calculation of FEMA costs shall be perfomed as accurately as is reasonableand practical based upon a professional hourly rate charged for the specificservice rendered to the recipient.<ITAG tagnum="84">Services Provided</ITAG>A. General InformationFEMA is responsible for review and assessment of the adequacy of offsiteemergency plans developed by State and local governments or licensees andthe capability of implementation of these plans. This review and assessmentfunction can be carried out in four different types of situations: (1)Upon formal submission of a State and local emergency plan by the Governorpursuant to 44 CFR Part 350 (Review and Approval Process of State and LocalRadiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness); (2) at the request of theNRC for an interim finding by FEMA pursuant to the FEMA-NRC MOU (50 FR15485, April 18, 1989); (3) at the request of the NRC pursuant to the FEMA-NRCMOU where a utility submits a utility-developed emergency response planin lieu of a State and local plan; and (4) upon the certification froma utility that State or local governments have refused or failed to adequatelyparticipate in emergency planning in accordance with 44 CFR Part 352 (CommercialNuclear Power Plants; Emergency Preparedness Planning). FEMA also may becalled upon to render technical assistance to State and local governmentsor licensees, separate from its formal review and assessment function forthe NRC. And in the event of an actual radiological emergency involvinga commercial nuclear power plant, FEMA may be called upon to respond andprovide support under the FRERP or any other Federal response effort. FEMA's services in providing support, review and assessment of the adequacyof offsite emergency plans provide assurance that the public health andsafety of citizens living around nuclear power plants are adequately protectedfrom the offsite consequences of radiological accidents. The public derivesa benefit from FEMA's services by securing an understanding and knowledgethat a cooperative system is in place that assures radiological emergencyplanning and preparedness. FEMA's support, review and assessment servicesrendered also directly benefit the licensee by assuring its compliancewith the statutory and regulatory requirements of the NRC. Any responseby FEMA to a radiological emergency also would benefit licensees by providingthem assistance and support in an actual emergency.B. ``350'' ProcessWhen a State seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiologicalemergency plan pursuant to 44 CFR Part 350 (Review and Approval Processof State and Local Radiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness), FEMAprovides the services described in 44 CFR Part 350 in regard to that request,and fees will be charged for such services to the licensee, which is theultimate beneficiary of FEMA's services. Fees will be charged for all FEMAconducted activities related to such services on a site-specific basis,including but not limited to the following: a. Acknowledgement of the State application and publication of notice ofFEMA's receipt of State plan. b. Plan distribution to and reviews by the Regional Assistance Committee(RAC). c. Plan evaluation and FEMA's determination. d. Exercise observation and evaluation, post-exercise briefing, and writtenevaluation. e. Notice and conduct of public meeting. f. Regional finding and determination of adequacy of plans and preparednessfollowed by review by Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committeeand FEMA Headquarters resulting in final FEMA determination of adequacyof plans and preparedness. g. Notice of determination to Governor, NRC, FEMA Region and by publicationin <T4>Federal Register</T4>.h. Conduct and evaluation of any remedial exercises and/or review and evaluationof any plan revisions. The above services are designed to protect the health and safety of thepublic living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providingreasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be takenoffsite in the event of a radiological emergency and that such plans arecapable of being implemented. Successful completion of these services benefitsthe licensees since the rendering of these services assists the licenseesin their compliance with NRC licensing requirements. C. Interim Findings Where the NRC seeks from FEMA under the FEMA-NRC MOU (50 FR 15845, April18, 1985) an interim finding, which represents a ``snapshot'' of radiologicalemergency planning and preparedness at the specific point in time for aspecific nuclear power plant, FEMA proposes to assess a fee to the plantlicensee for providing this service. The rendering of this service consistsof making a determination whether the plans are adequate to protect thehealth and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear powerfacility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protectivemeasures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergencyand that such plans are capable of being implemented. This service benefitsthe licensee since FEMA's rendering of such service assists the licenseein its compliance with NRC regulatory requirements. D. NRC Utility Plan Submissions Where the NRC, under the FEMA-NRC MOU (50 FR 15845, April 18, 1985), requestsFEMA to review and evaluate the adequacy of an emergency response plandeveloped by the utility absent participation by State and/or local governments,FEMA shall provide these services, and fees will be assessed to the licensee,which is the ultimate beneficiary of such FEMA services. Fees will be chargedfor all FEMA conducted activities related to such services on a site-specificbasis, including but not limited to the following: a. Publication of notice of FEMA's receipt of the utility's plan.b. Plan distribution to and review by the Regional Assistance Committee(RAC). c. Plan evaluation and FEMA determination. d. Exercise observation and evaluation, post-exercise briefing, and writtenevaluation. e. Notice and conduct of pubic meeting. f. Regional finding and determination of adequacy of plans and preparednessfollowed by review by Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committeeand FEMA Headquarters resulting in final FEMA determination of adequacyof plans and preparedness. g. Notice of determination to NRC and FEMA Region, and by publication in<T4>Federal Register</T4>.h. Conduct and evaluation of any remedial exercises and/or review and evaluationof any plan revisions. The above services are designed to protect the health and safety of thepublic living in the vacinity of the nuclear power facility by providingreasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be takenoffsite in the event of a radiological emergency and that such plans arecapable of being implemented. Successful completion of these services benefitsand licensee since the rendering of these services assists the licenseein its compliance with NRC licensing requirements. E. Utility Certification SubmissionWhen a licensee seeks Federal assistance pursuant to 44 CFR Part 352 dueto the decline or failure of a State or local government to adequatelyprepare emergency plans, FEMA shall process the licensee's certificationrequest and make the determination whether a decline or fail situationexists. Fees will be assessed for all FEMA services rendered in makingthe determination. Upon the determination that a decline or fail situationdoes exist, fees will be assessed for any services provided or securedby FEMA which result in a benefit to the licensee, as described in 44 CFRPart 352. These services may include technical assistance, and consultationand coordination with other Federal agencies on providing Federal technicalassistance, resources or facilities as required. F. FEMA Participation in NRC Adjudicatory ProceedingsWhere FEMA must participate in NRC licensing proceedings and any relatedcourt actions to support FEMA findings as a result of its support, reviewand approval of offsite emergency plans and preparedness, fees will beassessed to the licensee for such participation.G. FEMA Response to a Radiological Emergency In the event of a radiological emergency requiring a Federal response,any actions taken by FEMA to carry out such a response either under theFederal Radiological Emergency Response Plan or 44 CFR Part 352, pursuantto Executive Order 12657, will be assessed to the licensee of the siterequiring a Federal response. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fee Development</ITAG>A. Radiological Emergency Plans and PreparednessThe Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program within FEMA is responsiblefor processing applications for the review and approval of offsite radiologicalemergency plans and preparedness requested directly by a State under 44CFR Part 350 or by the NRC under the MOU (50 FR 15485, April 18, 1985)on behalf of the licensee. The REP Program also has responsibility forprocessing a licensee's certification when a E.O. 12657 request is madefor Federal assistance and for providing such assistance if warranted under44 CFR Part 352.In identifying the site-specific services FEMA renders to licensees, itwas determined that only those elements of the agency that provide suchservices benefitting licensees would be considered. Therefore, only threeorganizational units of the agency involved in the REP program were analyzedsince they provide site-specific services. These units are the Field OperationsBranch of the Technological Hazards Division of the Office of Natural andTechnological Hazards/State and Local Programs and Support Directorate,the FEMA Regional Offices/Natural and Technological Divisions, and theOffice of General Counsel. Agency units with REP responsibilities, butwhich are involved in developing policy guidance, planning FEMA emergencyresponse actions, and providing generic training on a non-site-specificbasis were excluded from fee calculations.The program's professional staff time is necessary to calculate the feefor site-specific offsite radiological emergency plans and preparednessservices provided by FEMA. Personnel that provide these services were identifiedresulting in professional staff figures, which were calculated into anaverage cost per work-year rate to maintain a professional employee whoprovides site-specific services for offset radiological emergency plansand preparedness. This rate was developed by using (1) the program's costof personnel compensation (salaries) for professional REP and legal staff,(2) personnel benefits for the professional REP and legal staff, (3) administrativesupport (e.g., clerical salaries and benefits, and printing), (4) travel,(5) cost of contractor support, and (6) overhead support (e.g., rent, utilities,etc.). This rate will be applied for site-specific services provided forlicensees on a professional staff hourly rate.The following shows how the professional staff work-year rate was developedfor site-specific services in support, review and approval of offsite radiologicalemergency plans and preparedness:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,44),tp0,p0,7/8,g1,t1,i1,s25,9,9</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1>Personnel compensation:<ITAG tagnum="2">REP Headquarters <D>$444,814</D><D>(9.5 FTE)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">REP Regions <D>1,940,469</D><D>(51.0 FTE)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Legal<D>101,677</D><D>(2.0 FTE)</D><R>n,s,n</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>$2,486,960</D></ITAG>This represents Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) professional staff dedicatedto performing services in Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) ona site-specific basis.

No charge will be made forwork not related to a site-specific project.The estimated fees licensees can expect to be charged will vary becauseFEMA's services will be based on work performed on a site-specific basis.The amount of work-performed will vary due to complexity of the work, forexample, plan review, exercises, federal coordination of resources, andFederal response. FEMA will only charge fees to licensees for site-specificservices rendered by FEMA personnel and/or FEMA contractors. FEMA willnot charge fees for services rendered to benefit a licensee by anotherFederal department or agency, consistent with authority granted under 31U.S.C. 9701.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Director has certified that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities.
