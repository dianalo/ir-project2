HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first five-minute test for AIDS has beenapproved by the U.S. government, and authorities said it is 99.6percent accurate and offers the fastest results of any tests for thedeadly disease.   The test was cleared Tuesday by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration. Its maker, Worcester-based Cambridge Bioscience,said it should be on the market in a few weeks.   ``This technical advance should help make testing available toall who want to be tested,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said inWashington. ``It will also be particularly useful in remote areas ofthe world that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests.''   The results of those earlier tests _ now the mainstay of AIDSscreening _ frequently are not available for weeks.   Gary Buck, chairman of Cambridge Bioscience, said the new test,called the Recombigen HIV-1 Latex Agglutination Test, should beuseful anywhere that quick results are important.   ``The big boon is that it's fast, and it will be useful in ThirdWorld countries and places where lab facilities might be less thanideal in order to screen large populations in a rapid, simple way,''said Dr. Paul Skolnik, a virologist at New England Medical Center.   The test is 99.6 percent accurate, Buck said. But the companyrecommends that as with the current screening test, called theenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, blood samples that arepositive for the AIDS virus be confirmed by a time-consuming, backuptest called the Western blot.   The speed of the Recombigen means those who are free of the virusare likely to be given the good news immediately, Buck said. Butthose who are probably infected will be told further testing isnecessary.   Like other AIDS tests, this one checks for AIDS infection byspotting antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,which causes AIDS.   ``All of the present (ELISA) tests require, under the best ofcircumstances, three to five hours,'' Buck said. ``This testrequires three to five minutes.''   Unlike the ELISA, which requires labs and technicians, the newtest can be given under crude conditions where even refrigeration islacking. Experts believe this should make the test useful in placeslike Africa, where acquired immune deficiency syndrome is widespreadand where blood is frequently not screened before transfusions.   Teena Lerner, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York,said the test also may be given in many settings in the UnitedStates, such as venereal disease clinics.   ``In a lot of the voluntary testing centers, there is a hugeproportion of people who don't come back to find the answer,'' shesaid. ``The ones who are most likely to be positive are the ones whoare most likely to chicken out.''   Other potential uses include testing trauma patients in emergencyrooms and checking organ donors before transplants.   Buck predicted the test will account for 10 percent to 15 percentof all AIDS testing during its second year on the market. It will besold to health care professionals for $10 per test, he said.   Although other companies are working on quick AIDS tests, Lernersaid she believes it will be at least a year before CambridgeBioscience's nearest competitor wins approval.   The new test is based on a portion of the protein that makes upthe outer jacket of the AIDS virus. This protein, which is madethrough genetic engineering, is coated onto tiny white latex beads.AIDS antibodies in blood are attracted to the protein, and when theycome together, the latex beads form clumps.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles orsyringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,and from pregnant women to their offspring.</TEXT></DOC>
