They've had to lean heavilyon their kids, who make up half the 12-man staff, and the result is erraticpitching and the league's worst ERA at 4.71.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SLUMPING A'S TURN TO HAWKINS FOR HELP  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     They suffered another disturbing road loss Tuesday, falling 6-1 to theBaltimore Orioles with rookie Joe Slusarski giving up five runs and theoffense scoring only once off 10 hits. The A's have lost 10 of their past 12road games, and their American League West lead over the Seattle Mariners hasdwindled to a half-game.;    In acquiring Hawkins, the A's add neededexperience at minimal cost. The Yankees, who released Hawkins last week, mustpay his $1.3 million salary, minus the pro-rated major league minimum the A'swill pay Hawkins.;    Hawkins, a 31-year-old right-hander who was 0-2 with a9.95 ERA this season, has agreed to terms but won't sign until the A's areready to activate him. He'll arrive today and pitch in the bullpen so A'spitching coach Dave Duncan and Manager Tony La Russa can evaluate how theywant to use him. But even if he begins in the bullpen, he's expected to beworked into the starting rotation.;    Hawkins is 80-87 lifetime. He was 5-12with the Yankees last season, but he lost a game in which he threw ano-hitter.;    It says something about the A's pitching staff that they wouldwant a pitcher discarded by the Yankees. A's General Manager Sandy Aldersonsaid the A's aren't concerned with Hawkins' performance with the Yankees thisseason.;    &quot;We think that his past performance, pitching on a more consistentbasis, is more indicative of his potential with us,&quot; he said. &quot;We're hopefulthat Tony and Dave Duncan can bring back some of his former levels of success.For us, it's a very low-risk proposition. Most importantly, we'll add someexperience to our pitching staff almost immediately.&quot;;    Alderson evensummoned some humor about the A's pitching situation: &quot;You won't even noticethat ERA amongst the rest of ours.&quot;;    The A's have been hit hard by pitchinginjuries, with relievers Gene Nelson, Todd Burns and Rick Honeycutt andstarter Dave Stewart on the disabled list. So, young pitchers have beenpressed into roles for which they had little preparation.;    &quot;I don't thinkit's an ideal situation to have five rookie pitchers (actually six) on yourstaff when you're trying to win a pennant. Too many times, those guys get putinto situations they're not ready for,&quot; Duncan said, &quot;and it's asking an awfullot for them to consistently perform in those situations. It's not the idealsituation, but I certainly like all the people that are here.&quot;;    RelieverEric Show was expected to be in the rotation before his D.L. stint, but theA's think they need the innings he can give them out of the bullpen.;    Rightnow, the A's could use innings out of a starter. Only Bob Welch has pitched atleast eight innings this season; he has done it three times.;    &quot;I'm justhoping somebody takes over and reels off five or six good starts, maybe thekid, (Kirk) Dressendorfer,&quot; said reliever Dennis Eckersley. &quot;I think it's(signing Hawkins) a good idea.&quot;;     HOW THEY SCORED;    Orioles 1st -- Withtwo out, C.Ripken homered.
