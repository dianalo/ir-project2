During the period of May-September1977 and May-July 1978 live-trap censuses were made. Small mammal speciesobserved in 1977 included the white-footed mouse, house mouse and meadowvole. In 1978 the prairie vole was also a common resident of the site.Population density estimates for house mice and prairie vole were 20(+/- 19.4) and 37.5 (+/- 20) respectively in June 1978. Evidence of habitatsegregation was observed between meadow vole and prairie vole with theformer species occupying densely vegetated areas of tall fescue, birdsfoottrefoil and cereal rye while prairie vole was more abundant in open areaswith similar vegetation. Both the mammalian and avian species observedon site were those typical of early old-field communities in SouthernIllinois. Four passerine species nested on site during the second yearfollowing seeding. No onsite nesting activity occurred during 1977. Commonamphibians observed around the pond included the southern leopard frog,Blanchards' cricket frog and american toad. Utilization of the pond bythese species occurred the first summer after reclamation was completed.</TEXT></DOC>
