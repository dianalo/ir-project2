As the commander of a small Israeli brigade in 1973, Mr.Kahalani held off a sneak attack by two and a half Syriandivisions for 72 crucial hours at the start of the Yom KippurWar. The Kahalani brigade's 42 tanks, arrayed along a 2,000yard gap between two extinct volcanoes, formed Israel's onlyline of defense between the Arab columns and the Jewish townsand kibbutzim of the Upper Galilee.</LP><TEXT>   In one of the fiercest armored clashes in history, theIsraelis lost 28 men and 35 tanks. Strewn across the grassyknoll was also the Syrian wreckage of 700 armored vehiclesand 230 tanks.   To many Israelis, the Veil of Tears, as that battle isknown, still dramatizes their own defiance toward Syria andits claim to the Golan Heights, conquered by Israel in theSix Day War of 1967. Still today, Syria maintains ninedivisions, or 90% of its army, along the 30 mile road betweenthe Golan border and Damascus.   A Syrian-Israeli peace accord would perhaps be thegreatest prize President Bush could pull out of the PersianGulf war. For years, Syria has said it won't negotiate withIsrael unless it agrees to give up the Golan. But last week,German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Syrianofficials told him Syria is ready to make peace with Israelas part of a broad Mideast security plan.   Israel, for its part, insists it won't let go of theGolan, which it essentially annexed in 1980. But aides toPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir say Israel is eager to holdtalks with Syria &quot;without preconditions.&quot;   &quot;Our position is that the Golan is part and parcel of theState of Israel,&quot; says Avi Pazner, an adviser to Mr. Shamir.&quot;But our goal is to reach the negotiating table. We believethat when there is talk, there can be an agreement.&quot;   Peace with Syria, once Iraq is defeated, may offer Israelits first real break from the threat of war since the Jewishstate's founding 43 years ago. The two countries -- whichfind themselves under the same, crowded U.S. umbrella in thewar against Iraq -- have toned down their officialpronouncements, but most Israelis remain skeptical about thechances for peace. It will take near-miraculous statesmanshipby President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker to leadIsrael and Syria to the promised new order of Mideast peace.   Parting the waters, in fact, may be step one. In additionto towering over several-thousand acres of the bestagricultural land in Israel, the Golan is the watershed forthe Jewish state's main water supply, the Jordan River. Inthe mid-1960s, when Syria still held the Golan, it tried tobuild a canal to shunt water from Israel. Israeli jetsdestroyed the project. Now, some Israelis believe that thesevere drought in the region, and Turkish dams along theEuphrates River, a vital source of Syrian water, could sparkanother Syrian attack on the Golan.   &quot;Golan sits on the water supply of Israel,&quot; says MeirMonitz, deputy mayor of Katzrin, whose 3,600 residentscomprise the only Jewish town on the heights. &quot;That's themain reason we're here.&quot;   For years, Israel has had a firm consensus for settlingthe Golan with Jews, in contrast to the bitter debate overwhat to do with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forone thing, the Golan wasn't part of the Biblical land ofIsrael, as was the West Bank. The decision also was eased bythe evacuation of 90% of the Golan's 100,000 or so mostlyDruze inhabitants after Israeli conquest. But, though Zionistplanners once hoped for some 50,000 Jewish settlers on theGolan, just 10,000 live there now.   One Western diplomat in Tel Aviv says the U.S. wants toinitiate dialogue between Syria and Israel on small problems,so-called confidence-building measures. For example, the twosides might find common ground in an effort to streamlineprocedures at the one border crossing in the Golan. But theIsraeli leadership, after watching Western officials paradeto Baghdad in recent years to meet the erstwhile pragmatistSaddam Hussein, is in no mood for trifling gestures.   &quot;The ultimate goal of a real peace treaty should be beforeour eyes before we start,&quot; says Benni Begin, a powerfulmember of the Israeli parliament and the son of formerIsraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.   Reserve Gen. Aryeh Shalev, an Israeli military expert,says he expects Syria to be less inclined to negotiate withIsrael after its foe, Iraq, has been gutted by the U.S.Instead, he says, Syria's President Hafez Assad is likely torenew his quest for leadership of the Arab world,particularly as long as Saudi Arabia continues pumping moneyhis way. &quot;I hardly see the possibility that the war will pavethe way for peace between Syria and Israel,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
