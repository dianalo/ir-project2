The company, which pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt ofcourt in the case but maintained it was innocent, vowed to appealthe U.S. District Court fine.   The El Segundo-based aerospace and manufacturing company wasfined $500,000 for an alleged conspircy among some of its managersto double bill the Air Force by approximately $450,000 on theNAVSTAR navigation satellite system between 1982 and 1984.   U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall ordered a $5 million finefor a contempt of court charge brought against Rockwell because theterms of settlement of an earlier, unrelated case barred the companyfrom fraudulent billing. The fine for contempt of court is unlimited.   Rockwell also was sentenced to five years' probation.   The company's attorney, James Neal, vowed to appeal the fine.   On Jan. 19, Rockwell entered a conditional plea of guilty to thecharges in an agreement with prosecutors under which a number ofrelated charges were dismissed.   The conditional plea was based on the company's appeal of anearly ruling in the case to a higher court. If that appeal were tosucceed, the company hoped to have its guilty plea erased from therecord.   Neal maintained the fraud was perpetrated by division managerswithout the knowledge or consent of upper management.   In the earlier ruling, the judge rejected a company motion tothrow the case out of court on grounds that Rockwell had reportedthe fraud under provisions of a Pentagon program intended toencourage defense contractors to report dishonesty.   Since it entered its plea, Rockwell has engaged in a publicrelations campaign portraying itself as a victim of overzealousprosecution, and maintaining that the example of Rockwell's casewould deter other defense contractors from reporting fraud under thePentagon's voluntary disclosure program.   Federal prosecutors maintain that Rockwell didn't report thefraud until after auditors were on the trail.   The case involves billing for repairs to the satellite's radiogear performed by a subcontractor, ITT Corp.'s defensecommunications division. ITT wasn't a defendant.   A Rockwell manager, Robert Zavodnik, 47, has pleaded guilty tolying to the government and conspiracy in the case. His supervisor,Donald Carter, 60, was acquitted of the same charges by a federaljury.</TEXT></DOC>
