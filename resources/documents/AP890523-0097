SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mankind's growth is accelerating again as theworld adds the equivalent of another Mexico every year, thePopulation Reference Bureau reported Tuesday.   The private research group said that the world's populationgrowth, after having slowed in the 1970s, is speeding up once more.As of mid-1989, the world will contain about 5.24 billion people,nearly a quarter-billion more than in 1987.   Demographers Carl Haub and Mary Kent report that the expansionfrom 5 billion to 6 billion could be attained in a record time _within less than a decade _ if growth continues at current rates.   The world is adding about 90 million people per year, slightlymore than the current Mexican population estimated at 87 million.   The report is in line with one issued a week ago by Nafis Sadik,executive director of the United Nations Population Fund. Thatreport agreed with the Reference Bureau estimate, and the U.N.official called for increased access to family planning, educationand employment for women around the globe.   Kent and Haub's comments accompanied the annual World PopulationData Sheet, a poster-size summary of world population trendscompiled annually by the private group.   ``Even to reach a stable world population size of 10 billion,double the current total, birth rates will have to begin a steadydescent soon,'' they said.   There have been declines in the growth rate in some developingcountries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, but there islittle evidence of change in many others, they reported.   ``Unless we see declines in high fertility rates in many Africanand Asian countries during the 1990s, the prospect for worldpopulation to level out at less than 10 billion seems very dim,''they said.   ``As far as ultimate world population size is concerned, the1990s will truly be a decade of decision,'' they added.   At current rates, the world's population will rise to 6.3billion by the year 2000 and to 8.3 billion by 2020, the groupestimated, adding that the planet's population will double in 39years.   The summary notes a sharp difference between developed anddeveloping nations.   It reports developed nations currently contain 1.2 billionpeople and will take 122 years to double their population. Thedeveloping nations, however, already contain 4 billion and can beexpected to double in 32 years.   China remains the most populated country on Earth with 1.1billion people and an estimated doubling time of 49 years.   Second is India with 835 million and it has a faster growthrate. Expected doubling time there is 32 years.   Far behind those two population giants, the Soviet Union isthird with 289 million people and a doubling time of 70 years.   The United States is fourth in population at 248 million andthis country will likely take 98 years to double that number.   Fifth is Indonesia, with 184.6 million people and a doublingtime of 35 years.   Other nations with more than 100 million residents, and theiranticipated doubling times, are Brazil, 147 million, 34 years;Japan, 123 million, 141 years; Nigeria, 115 million, 24 years;Bangladesh, 115 million, 25 years; Pakistan, 110 million, 24 years.</TEXT></DOC>
