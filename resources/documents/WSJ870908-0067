Some predict that the Federal Reserve's discount rate, or the fee it charges banks and other financial institutions, will be raised to 6 1/2% in the months ahead. It was boosted to 6% from 5 1/2% Friday, prompting banks to raise their prime lending rates to 8 3/4% from 8 1/4%.    The prime also is likely to rise again this year as the Fed seeks to counter investor fear that big trade deficits will cause the dollar to sink, driving up inflation, these analysts say.    Inflation fears have been simmering for several months in the credit markets, where yields on 30-year government bonds -- now 9.46%, the highest rate since Jan. 14, 1986 -- are two percentage points above last February's level. Rates on Treasury bills and other money market instruments also have spurted almost a percentage point since the start of the year.    &quot;This isn't the end of the rise in rates,&quot; said Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist at Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh. &quot;Before the year ends, the Fed likely will raise the discount rate another half percentage point. I have no doubt that the Fed is worried about further downward pressure on the dollar.&quot;    The increase in the discount rate was the first since April 9, 1984, when the rate went to 9% from 8 1/2%. Since then, it has been cut seven successive times. The previous cut, announced Aug. 20, 1986, brought the rate to 5 1/2% from 6%. The discount rate increase, in addition to prompting banks to raise their prime rates, also spurred the Veterans Administration to boost its top mortgage rate to 10 1/2% from 10%.    Although Federal Reserve officials didn't mention the dollar's recent decline against most major currencies and its negative impact on the bond market, many economists believe the Fed recognizes the close correlation between a sinking dollar and falling bond prices.    The Fed's &quot;highly visible&quot; tightening &quot;serves as a counterpunch to the pervasively negative psychology toward the dollar in the foreign exchange markets,&quot; said David M. Jones, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. But even Mr. Jones, acknowledging the connection between the dollar and the bond market, expects the dollar to weaken further, pulling bond prices down with it and prompting the Fed to tighten credit again in the months ahead.    Yesterday, for example, when the U.S. markets were closed for Labor Day, actively traded 30-year government bonds fell nearly 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, in London and Tokyo trading.    &quot;To an increasing degree, domestic interest rates are being dictated by foreign investors&quot; as a result of the budget and trade deficits, said Mr. Robertson of Mellon Bank. The recent collapse of the bond market &quot;to a large extent can be explained by the dollar's weakness. Since last December, Japanese investors in long-term Treasury bonds have lost 30%&quot; of their principal.    Many traders say the credit and foreign exchange markets may gain only temporary stability from the Fed's action, because the 1/2-point rise in the discount rate wasn't in line with other money rate increases recently.    &quot;I would expect&quot; yields on 30-year Treasury bonds &quot;to fall back to 9.25% in the next few weeks,&quot; said Kerry Roche, a partner at Brophy, Gestal, Knight andamp; Co., one of the 40 primary government securities dealers reporting to the Fed. &quot;We're still in a bear market trend and if anything the mood is getting more negative because investors increasingly realize that the trade deficit, which drives the dollar, isn't narrowing appreciably.&quot;    F. Ward McCarthy, manager of financial economics at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, predicted higher interest rates in coming months with &quot;the lack of fiscal repair, creeping inflation, a sticky trade deficit and a vulnerable dollar providing the fundamental backdrop&quot; for lower bond prices.    In addition, Mr. McCarthy said the lack of improvement in the trade deficit &quot;will fuel protectionist fervor in the early stages of a presidental election and increase the likelihood of some ill-conceived protectionist legislation.&quot; Such legislation, he said, was partly responsible for driving away foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, when the bond market tumbled in April.    In the meantime, Fed officials continue to face a dilemma. If they raise rates in an effort to reduce inflation pressures, they could choke off growth five years into an expansion. But if they do nothing, rates might surge anyway because of growing nervousness about inflation and undermine the Fed's credibility among investors as an inflation-fighter.    Whatever the Fed does, &quot;the chances are now quite good that we'll test the 10%&quot; yield level on Treasury bonds due in 30 years, said Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.    The latest round of prime rate increases, initiated by Chemical Bank, was the fourth this year and brought the rate to its highest level since April 1986, when it was 9%.    Prime rate increases draw widespread attention because the prime is used by banks as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses as well as on a growing number of consumer loans, including the highly popular home-equity loans. In contrast, long-term government bond yields, which are benchmarks for mortgage securities, increasingly influence fixed-rate mortage rates.    Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages, jumped more than 0.2 percentage point last week to an average 10.66%, their highest level since mid-June, according to HSH Associates of Riverdale, N.J. The firm surveys 2,000 lenders coast to coast. As recently as March 26, the average conventional 30-year mortgage rate was only 9.09%.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Prices of most debt securities edged lower with actively traded 30-year government bonds declining 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 94 6/32 from 94 10/32 Thursday, as the yield remained little changed at 9.46%. Shearson Lehman Brothers's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 1.47 points to 1201.09. The index ranged between 1195.85 and 1209.16.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 95 22/32 from 95 30/32 as the yield climbed to 9.3% from 9.26% Thursday.    Short-term interest rates climbed sharply amid the discount and prime rate increases. The rate on the government's 13-week bills rose to 6.38% bid from 6.18% bid Thursday. The rate on the government's 26-week bills rose to 6.52% from 6.27%.    The rate on federal funds averaged 6.89%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.), up from an average of 6.84% Thursday. Federal funds -- reserves that banks lend each other overnight, and a closely watched barometer of monetary policy -- could trade consistently above 7% in the weeks ahead as the Fed tightens its grip on credit, some analysts say. </TEXT></DOC>
