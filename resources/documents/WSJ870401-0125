Last summer, for instance, Nomura swiped a prized client away from Nikko Securities Co., a major competitor. Nomura won over the client, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and became the lead broker on a huge convertible-bond deal.    &quot;Nomura was very aggressive in persuading the Ministry of Finance to allow our new issue,&quot; says Yu Tashiro, Mitsubishi's managing director of finance. &quot;Nikko wasn't so aggressive.&quot;    Aggressiveness -- or just pure aggression -- seems to befit Nomura Securities. Nomura was a fierce competitor when it opened its doors as a tiny Osaka bond house in 1925, and it remains a fierce competitor today as a financial giant with 11,000 employees in 155 offices, some four million customers, a business and financial research institute, a management school, vast real-estate holdings and $237 billion in customer assets, more than the deposits of any bank in the world. It is heavy with cash and towers over its Japanese rivals. In its latest fiscal year, it earned far more than Citicorp did.    But size alone doesn't fully describe Nomura's growing importance in the major leagues of world finance. It also serves as a principal agent in the recycling of Japan's enormous buildup of wealth.    In the 1970s, when oil-exporting nations were getting rich, U.S. banks were the major recyclers. Now, Japan is doing most of the recycling of its own money, through its banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses. As Japan's overseas investments are growing -- its net long-term capital outflow topped $131 billion last year -- so are the financial resources and the global reach of many of its institutions.    Some Japanese companies have increased their clout partly through acquisitions: Nippon Life Insurance Co. is buying a 13% stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., the securities arm of American Express Co., and last year Sumitomo Bank Ltd. bought a major interest in Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. But Nomura, pushing ahead on its own, has extended its global reach the most of all.    In London, Nomura emerged almost overnight last year as the No. 2 underwriter in the Eurobond market, trailing only Credit Suisse-First Boston. So far this year, it is No. 1; by March 20, it had been the lead underwriter for 36 issues totaling $4.68 billion. It recently established a British bank. In its quest for social respectability in London, it has hired large numbers of Oxford and Cambridge graduates and bought a manor house in a London suburb, largely for entertaining.    In New York, where Nomura is weak, the firm is pursuing its most ambitious expansion strategy of all. It owns a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, and last December it acquired the status of &quot;primary dealer&quot; in U.S. Treasury securities. In some recent quarterly auctions, Nomura bought well in excess of 10% of the entire Treasury issue. Back in Tokyo, executives are talking about buying American brokerage houses and hiring more specialists in fields ranging from bond trading to arbitrage to Fed watching.    &quot;We don't want to be a Japanese restaurant in New York serving only sushi and sukiyaki,&quot; says Yoshio Terasawa, Nomura's executive vice president in charge of international business. &quot;We want to serve French cuisine, American fast food, everything, in the future.&quot;    In one sense, Nomura is just another Japanese exporter -- whose product happens to be money. Nomura's tactics -- and those of such rivals as Nikko, Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- aren't much different from the tactics used by Sony Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and dozens of other Japanese manufacturing companies.    As an opening wedge, Nomura has targeted the simple, big-volume segments of the financial markets -- such as U.S. Treasury securities and Eurobonds (bonds issued by a borrower outside his own country, primarily in Europe). It has built market share by slashing prices, accepting razor-thin margins if necessary, and in some cases, critics charge, taking a tactical loss on a transaction to woo clients.    This formula, so successful for earlier groups of Japanese exporters, is doing wonders for Nomura, too. Says Jiro Tokuyama, a retired executive of Nomura Research Institute, &quot;Like Japan itself, Nomura has moved up so fast it hardly knows its own strength.&quot;    Some students of Wall Street predict a replay of what happened in Detroit and Silicon Valley. The Japanese &quot;invasion&quot; of Wall Street, they believe, will seriously threaten the likes of Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch, First Boston and some European financial firms.    &quot;Nomura has been building expertise for 10 years in the U.S., and it's only a matter of time before they get all the pieces together,&quot; says Perrin Long, an analyst of the brokerage industry at Lipper Analytical Services. &quot;Nomura is the tortoise. Salomon and Goldman Sachs are trying to be so innovative. But the tortoise is going to be loaded with cash and sitting in the driver's seat.&quot;    The competition is already heating up between Japanese and American brokerage houses. Salomon Brothers is often seen going toe-to-toe with the Japanese giants all over the world, including Tokyo; Salomon recently bought 40% of a $296 million Japanese-government bond offering, for example. Other American firms have eschewed &quot;plain vanilla&quot; financing, favoring instead the more complex, &quot;high technology&quot; operations -- such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, mergers and swaps of less developed countries' debt.    &quot;In these areas, we don't yet see the Japanese,&quot; says Richard Huber, a group executive at Citicorp's investment bank. &quot;But don't say we underrate them. They are tough, formidable competitors.&quot; He adds that Nomura, with its deep financial pockets, can &quot;make lots of mistakes and wouldn't even feel it.&quot;    Nomura has some big problems, however. As it goes international, it faces the same difficulties plaguing other Japanese multinationals, especially trouble blending Japanese and non-Japanese staff.    All of Nomura's senior executives are Japanese. Relations in the New York office between Japanese and non-Japanese have been strained at times, and a crisis erupted last summer when several Americans complained about a lack of any real responsibility. Americans on the equity trading desk staged a brief strike, and last year many employees left Nomura for Salomon, Baring Securities and other firms.    &quot;The difficulty isn't only between Japanese and non-Japanese. The U.S. and U.K. staffs don't always get along,&quot; says Hideo Sakamaki, Nomura's senior managing director for personnel and planning in Tokyo. He worries that the problems could hurt the firm. &quot;To underwrite an American company's issue in Europe and sell it in Japan, you need the cooperation of three nationalities,&quot; he observes.    Culture clashes probably were inevitable, considering that Nomura is a Japanese company doing business in the traditional Japanese way. On Wall Street, job-hopping is common, for example; at Nomura, the professional staff is recruited straight out of college and customarily stays on until retirement.    That isn't the only difference. While American brokerage houses motivate salesmen and traders by commissions, fees and performance-based bonuses, Nomura men work primarily on a fixed salary, with twice-a-year bonuses that have little to do with individual performance. The salaries themselves are but a fraction of what a successful broker or trader earns on Wall Street or in London. Some of Nomura's biggest deal makers earn less than $100,000 a year.    The system offers its own rewards, though. A bond trader can bet $250 million on a move in the market without betting his career. Although incompetents are shunted into obscure affiliates, able people enjoy job security and job rotation that give them broad exposure to the financial world. Moreover, the lifetime-employment system builds teamwork.    However, that system is causing problems as Nomura internationalizes its operations. Nomura's insularity and inbred culture have produced managers who have spent most of their lives in Japan, speaking only to other Japanese in trading rooms, board rooms, noodle shops and bars.    But Nomura is committed to going global. Yoshihisa Tabuchi, Nomura's president since late 1985, calls its international strategy &quot;dochakuka,&quot; which some Nomura people translate as &quot;homesteading.&quot; The implication: The firm plans to stay in a market against all adversity, become part of the landscape and eventually take the lead. Says Mr. Terasawa, who is in charge of international business:    &quot;We stayed in Honolulu, where we started in 1960. We were the only Japanese brokerage house in Honolulu. Then, our three competitors came, but they withdrew. Now, we're alone {the only Japanese securities firm} in Honolulu.&quot;    Mr. Terasawa says Nomura is equally determined to stay the course in New York. &quot;We've been in New York ever since 1953 -- {for} 34 years. We had red figures until 1969,&quot; he says.    But despite its growth in business and in personnel, Nomura is still a minor player in corporate finance and elsewhere in American investment banking. It lacks a big U.S. customer base, a network of customers such as banks, insurance companies or wealthy individuals; thus, it has trouble acting as the lead underwriter of American stocks and corporate bonds. The lead underwriter organizes a syndicate of brokerage houses that buys many of the securities and then &quot;places&quot; them with investors. Customarily, the lead firm agrees to purchase the largest single block.    To head its American operations, Nomura recently named Masaaki Kurokawa, a 52-year-old who has both London and U.S. experience and is highly regarded by the brass in Tokyo. He also commands the loyalty of many lower-level Nomura managers, who regard him as polished and somewhat intimidating but fair.    Nomura's top executives are discussing ways to increase its U.S. &quot;placing power.&quot; One possibility is to acquire an American brokerage house. A rumored target is E.F. Hutton, which could give Nomura a large retail-broker network. However, Mr. Terasawa says, &quot;We aren't going to buy E.F. Hutton, but there are many other possibilities. We might acquire the research department of Brokerge House A or acquire a certain division of Brokerage House B or acquire regional firms in Kentucky or Tennessee or wherever.&quot;    The Japanese &quot;invasion&quot; is hardly limited to Nomura. Other big Japanese securities firms also have global ambitions and expect that, by the early 1990s, a shakeout will have radically changed the brokerage and banking fields.    &quot;There'll be 15 major institutions. All the rest will be localized or boutiques,&quot; says Toshio Mori, the chairman of Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York. Mr. Mori sees the whole industry in transition. &quot;In the past, we had national boundaries and national markets, but now we're talking about global trading and global markets,&quot; he says.    To expand internationally, the Japanese houses want to increase their presence in the U.S., organize banking operations to get better access to foreign exchange -- a necessary ingredient in cooking up complex international financing deals -- and develop power in mergers and acquisitions. All of this requires highly skilled people -- but many such people feel little allegiance to any particular firm.    The main reason Nomura hasn't turned to acquisitions for growth, Mr. Terasawa says, is the fear that it may pay a lot for a company, only to see the good employees leave.    Nomura says its U.S. offices will concentrate on institutional customers rather than individuals. Mr. Terasawa also says it wants to double its U.S. offices to 10, adding branches in places such as Boston, Florida and Texas. It currently has offices in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as New York and Honolulu.    So far, Nomura's leading edge into U.S. institutional business has been the Treasury market. The firm has made a splash on Wall Street, and profits have dwindled in all three major trading markets -- New York, London and Tokyo -- as the Japanese firms have been pitted against one another and against American and European brokers. Profit margins in the Treasury-bond business, for example, have narrowed from 1/8th to 1/32nd percentage point in the past two years or so.    Acknowledging that the Japanese firms and Japanese institutional investors &quot;are squeezing the profit margins,&quot; an American trader in Tokyo adds: &quot;But we're in there knocking around with them. We'll stand up. We'll take our losses. We can do it, too.&quot; He adds, however, that some American traders in Tokyo have been demoralized by the intense competition and shrinking profit margins.    Nomura has also been competing fiercely in Europe, and nowhere has its push into international finance been as visible as in the fast-growing Euromarkets, where governments and corporations, attracted by relatively low interest rates and minimal red tape, have turned increasingly to sell securities beyond their own national boundaries.    Not surprisingly, Nomura has won many of the bidding contests to be the lead underwriter when major Japanese corporations tap the Euromarkets. In addition, it is winning a lot of bidding contests involving non-Japanese borrowers. Typical deals won last year by Nomura were the Canadian government's two $500 million trips to the Eurobond market.    Putting the first transaction together, in February 1986, required the coordination of Nomura managers on three continents -- and illustrates the multinational nature of high finance. The bid began with Nomura's Toronto office, which learned that Canada wanted to raise about $500 million with a 10- to 15-year maturity. That information was sent to Nomura's investment bankers in New York, to its Euromarket experts in London and back to the Tokyo office, which organizes investor syndicates and coordinates deal making.    In this case, a Japanese brokerage house put together a transaction to issue Canadian debt denominated in yen and offered in Europe, primarily to central bankers. One more twist: The yen thus raised were &quot;swapped&quot; into U.S. dollars for delivery to the Canadian government.    &quot;We had several telephone conferences, and at the final bidding, we had people on the line in Ottawa, and our people on in Toronto, New York, London and on a speakerphone in Tokyo,&quot; says a manager in the Tokyo head office. &quot;The final bidding decision is made by a senior managing director of international finance. In highly competitive cases, President Tabuchi also gets involved.&quot;    It was a far humbler Nomura Securities that first set up business in December 1925 as the successor to the bond department of the Osaka Nomura Bank. At its founding, the securities firm had 84 employees and concentrated on bonds; in the 1930s, it diversified into stocks. It grew steadily and became a pillar of the Nomura andamp; Co. &quot;zaibatsu,&quot; or business combine.    However, Nomura brokers weren't a happy lot. Like all brokers in Japan, they were scorned as &quot;kabuya&quot; -- &quot;stock peddlers.&quot; Much more than in the U.S., the Japanese stock market has always carried a whiff of disreputability. A stockbroker had roughly the social status of a racetrack tipster -- a stigma that still hasn't faded completely. As social pariahs and financial street fighters, Nomura brokers often suffered from feelings of inferiority. Jiro Tokuyama, a retired Nomura Research Institute executive, recalls hearing a story of humiliation from Minoru Segawa, Nomura's president in the late 1950s and 1960s.    When still a young salesman, Mr. Segawa called on a leading Japanese industrialist at his home. Mr. Segawa went to the front door, but the man derided him as a lowly &quot;stock peddler&quot; and told him to enter through the kitchen.    To Mr. Tokuyama, who also served as the dean of the Nomura School of Advanced Management, Mr. Segawa's experience offers a clue to Nomura's drive. &quot;Through experiences like this, Nomura got tough,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, some people get humiliated, they get frustrated and go down. Others use it in a positive way. They develop drive. They move up.&quot;    After World War II ended, there was hardly any business to be done. Half of Nomura's 14 branches had been destroyed, and the U.S. occupation authorities forced the breakup of the Nomura combine.    Nomura reorganized itself, at first doing business mostly as a stockbroker. It looked to American brokerage houses for a role model and found Merrill Lynch. Stories abound of Nomura managers visiting Merrill Lynch's offices in New York and taking copious notes. Legend has it that Nomura men even measured the desks.    From the American firm, Nomura learned how to build a retail-sales network. The brush with U.S. brokers also gave the Nomura people a dream of social respectability. &quot;The American stockbrokers didn't have any inferiority complex toward the banks,&quot; says Hideo Matsumura, a senior executive. &quot;Working at Merrill Lynch was prestigious.&quot;    Working at Nomura still was far from prestigious. The Japanese bureaucracy and commercial banks attracted the brainiest graduates of the best universities; Nomura recruited at lesser schools, often scouting the rugby or judo squads. It set exacting quotas for its new hires, and they worked notoriously long hours. Several former employees say they can't remember a single Nomura salesman failing to reach his quota.    The pressures to achieve are still intense, and brokers are undoubtedly tempted to resort to high-pressure tactics -- which partly explains why brokers have been held in low esteem. However, Nomura officials say customer complaints about unauthorized trading are rare.    Critics disagree. They say unauthorized trading in customer accounts is pervasive in the Japanese securities industry. Says Shunsuke Taniyasu, an investment adviser at Towa Securities, &quot;It's robbery. It certainly isn't just Nomura. Other securities companies are doing lots of it.&quot;    In any event, lawsuits are uncommon. In the securities business, as in other aspects of Japanese life, disputes are usually resolved quietly and don't get into the courts. Securities firms normally make restitution to clients who show that a salesman has taken advantage of them. Japan hasn't any Securities and Exchange Commission policing the markets and keeping tabs on the amount of unfair dealing.    Occasionally, however, cases have gone to court. In one recent lawsuit, decided against Nomura, a Tokyo court ruled that Nomura representatives engaged in unauthorized trading. In another case, still pending in Tokyo, Nomura has been accused of &quot;churning&quot; an Osaka customer's account to produce excessive commissions. Nomura denies any wrongdoing and says all trades in the Osaka case were authorized.    Whatever the merits of such complaints, there is no denying that Nomura has a powerful sales force, especially in its 121 branches, and it is unquestionably a major weapon in its arsenal. The salesmen can sell -- or &quot;stuff,&quot; in investment-banker jargon -- just about anything that Nomura underwrites. And that, in turn, is one reason Nomura can offer highly competitive bids in the marketplace.    Asked to describe Nomura's strongest attribute, Citicorp's Mr. Huber responds simply, &quot;Incredible stuffing power.&quot;    To many observers in Japan, Europe and the U.S., Nomura is gradually developing more than mere muscle, however. It is developing sophistication, even though its staff is still hindered by parochialism. The growing trend away from bank lending toward securities-based lending should greatly accelerate Nomura's future growth. And many believe that Nomura is gathering more technical prowess.    But some former employees worry that the growing power may engender growing arrogance. They say Nomura, which from the beginning has had forward-looking men with a touch of modesty in its top ranks, may be developing single-mindedly money-hungry people in its middle ranks.    &quot;Today,&quot; says Mr. Tokuyama, the Nomura Research Institute retiree, grabbing his lapels in a gesture of mock arrogance, &quot;The attitude is, 'Look at us.'&quot;    ---                       Nomura's Growth                     Year ended Sept. 30                             1986       1985                 (In millions of U.S. dollars)    Revenue              $ 6,277.1  $ 3,930.6    Net income             1,472.4      739.3    Total assets          19,509.9   14,518.8               Share Price, Tokyo Stock Exchange    High                    $24.40      $8.84    Low                       6.32       4.40    Note: Revenue, net income and asset figures are on aconsolidated basis, including subsidiaries, and are convertedto dollars at a rate of 150 yen to the dollar.
