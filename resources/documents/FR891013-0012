Background</ITAG>Basis of the SystemA Medicaid management information system (commonly known as the MMIS orreferred to as ``the system'') is a mechanized system of claims processingand information retrieval used in State Medicaid programs under title XIXof the Social Security Act (the Act). The system, originally authorizedby section 1903(a)(3) of the Act, is used to process Medicaid claims fromproviders and to retrieve and produce utilization data and management informationabout medical care and services furnished to recipients. Each State (withsome exceptions) is required by section 1903(r) of the Act to have in placean operational and approved system or be subject to reductions of Federalfinancial participation (FFP).Section 1903(a)(3) of the Act authorizes FFP at 90 percent of the sumsa State Medicaid agency expends for the design, development, or installationof a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system thatthe Secretary determines is likely to provide more efficient, economicaland effective administration of the program and at 75 percent for the operationof these systems. (Hereafter, we will refer to 90 percent and 75 percentFFP as ``enhanced'' FFP since it is greater than the 50 percent FFP authorizedfor most Medicaid administrative expenses.)Current RegulationsOur regulations concerning mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval systems are at 42 CFR part 433, subpart C. Section 433.111 definesterms used in obtaining enhanced Federal funding for mechanized claimsprocessing and information retrieval systems. A State agency's system mustcomply with the requirements in andSection; 433.112 through andSection; 433.122to enable the agency to obtain enhanced funding for the design, development,installation or enhancement of a system. These sections discuss the availabilityof enhanced FFP, identify the conditions a system must meet for approvaland reapproval and specify that an agency must meet system requirementsand performance standards if it is to continue to receive enhanced funding.The sections also explain that enhanced funding for automated eligibilitysystems is not available as such systems are not part of mechanized claimsprocessing and information retrieval systems nor are they enhancementsto such systems. Section 433.123 describes procedures we follow to ensurethat we inform interested parties adequately before we make changes inconditions of approval or reapproval and in system requirements for requiredsystems eligible for enhanced funding.A State that chooses to develop, enhance or replace its required systemor subsystems must first submit for approval an advanced planning document(APD). The general HHS requirements for approval of APDs are found at 45CFR part 95, subpart F, which prescribe the conditions under which HHSwill approve FFP at applicable rates for costs of automated data processingfor the Medicaid program and for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC) and the Child Support Enforcement program (titles IV-A and IV-Dof the Act, respectively). On December 18, 1986, HHS revised 42 CFR 433.111by removing the content of the definitions of all the terms found therepreviously (except that of ``mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval system'') and cross-referring the reader to 45 CFR 95.605 fordefinitions of the other terms. The term ``improvement'' was replaced by``enhancement'' in andSection;andSection; 433.111 and 433.112. See 45 CFR 95.625(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Changes to Regulations</ITAG>On August 11, 1988, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking (53 FR30317). We proposed to change our rules so that we would approve an APDas being likely to provide more efficient, economical and effective administrationof the State plan only for a mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval system that consists of the federally required, or core, subsystemsof that system, which we describe in part 11 of the State Medicaid Manualor federally required changes to the system or subsystem.A. ``Mechanized Claims Processing and Information Retrieval System''We proposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the currentdefinition of ``mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystem'' in 42 CFR 433.111 so that it consists of the HCFA-required, orcore, subsystems specified in the State Medicaid Manual. We proposed thatif a State were to initiate changes to its system as likely to providemore efficient, economical and effective administration of the State planand HCFA approved the changes, they would be funded at the regular matchingrate of 50 percent in accordance with andSection; 433.15(b)(7) and 45 CFRpart 95, subpart F.Under the proposed revised definition, ``mechanized claims processing andinformation retrieval system'' would be the six Statewide core subsystemsof software and hardware used (1) to process claims by providers of medicalcare and services for items and services furnished to eligible recipientsunder the Medicaid program and (2) to retrieve and produce service utilizationand management information that is required by the Medicaid single Stateagency and Federal government for Medicaid program administration and auditpurposes. The system would be used to process claims only for items andservices covered under the State plan.B. EnhancementsWe also proposed to delete the term ``enhancement'' found in current andSection;433.111. Neither the term ``enhancement'' nor ``improvement'', as enhancementwas formerly called, appear in the statute. Under our proposal, we wouldfund only HCFA-approved core systems and subsystems and HCFA-required changesat the enhanced funding rates. Conversely, we proposed that any modificationsuggested by a State that is not approved by HCFA as a core system requirementwould not be viewed by HCFA as an ``improvement'' for purposes of enhancedFFP.Under our proposal, the only changes for which we had planned to allow75 or 90 percent funding would be HCFA-required changes to the requiredcore system or subsystems. We proposed to fund any other system designand development changes that were approved at the regular 50 percent matchingrate.Under andSection; 433.112, we proposed to approve 90 percent FFP only whenthe requirements published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and in Part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual forthe system being designed, developed, or installed are met. Approval ofa system for 75 percent FFP for operation continued to depend on that systemmeeting the published requirements as required by andSection; 433.116.C. Technical ClarificationsWe also proposed to revise andSection; 433.112(a) to read as it did fromJuly 30, 1985 to December 18, 1986, except that it would not include theterm ``improvement''. When this section was revised on December 18, 1986,the language that was in the Code of Federal Regulations before July 30,1985 was inadvertently used. Since there was no intention to change thesubstance of this paragraph in December, 1986, we proposed to restore theearlier language.D. Use of ``System'' Instead of ``MMIS''We also proposed to change the references in the regulations from ``MMIS''(which appear in andSection;andSection; 433.121, 433.130 and 433.131), to ``system,''which is the short form for the term ``mechanized claims processing andinformation retrieval system'' and is currently in use in all sectionsin part 433, subpart C except andSection; 433.131. We have not defined ``MMIS''in regulations and would make the change for consistency.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Revisions to Implement Public Law 99-272</ITAG>We also proposed revising our regulations to implement section 1903(A)of the Act to conform with changes made by sections 9503(b)(2) and 9518of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), Pub. L.99-272, as enacted April 7, 1986.Section 9503(b)(2)(A) of COBRA amends section 1903(r)(4)(A) of the Actby requiring the Secretary to review each approved system at least onceevery three years, instead of once a year. Section 9503(b)(2)(B) amendssection 1903(r)(4)(A) of the Act to permit the Secretary, at his discretion,to review either the entire system of a system State agency or only thosestandards, system requirements and other conditions demonstrating weaknessin previous reviews.Section 9518 of COBRA amends section 1903(r)(1)(B) of the Act so that Stateagencies must have had an approved system no later than September 30, 1985,instead of September 30, 1982. The amendment applies to payment made undersection 1903(a) of the Act for calendar quarters beginning on or afterOctober 1, 1982.We proposed to revise andSection; 433.119, conditions for yearly approval;notice of decision, to show that we would review each system operationat least once every three years and to indicate that we would not haveto review the entire system but we would, at a minimum, have to reviewparts of the system operation that showed weaknesses in the previous review.We would revise andSection; 433.122 to delete the references to ``yearly''review. We proposed to revise andSection; 433.113, reduction of FFP for failure tooperate a system and obtain initial approval, to change the deadline bywhich an agency must have an approved system to September 30, 1985. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Funding For Optional Systems and Subsystems </ITAG>In the proposed rule, we discussed funding for third party liability andfor eligibility determination systems. A. Third Party Liability We interpret section 9503(a) of COBRA as requiring State Medicaid agenciesto have an approved plan of action for third-party liability (TPL) andto use the system to carry out the plan of action. We currently requirethese statutory TPL changes as part of the core system by regulation (42CFR 433.122(b)(2)). If these requirements are not currently part of anysystem approved for enhanced matching, they should be implemented as systemrequirements to all approved systems for which enhanced matching is claimed.If system modifications are required in some States to meet COBRA requirements,we will continue to make enhanced FFP available for modifications to thoseTPL systems that are part of the required core system. B. Eligibility Determination Systems <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>Since 1977, HCFA has made available 90 percent FFP for the design, development,installation or improvement of eligibility determination systems, subjectto approved APDs, and 75 percent FFP for the subsequent operation of thesesystems, on the basis that applications for eligibility were ``claims''and that a system processing these ``claims'' was a part of the mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval system. In 1981, section 403(a)(3)(B) of the Act was added by section 406 of PublicLaw 96-265; it requires the Secretary to provide 90 percent FFP for thedesign, development and installation of a mechanized eligibility determinationsystem that meets the requirements of section 402(a)(30) of the Act forAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). In addition, the sectionrequires the Secretary to determine that the systems are ``likely to providemore efficient, economical, and effective administration of the plan andto be compatible with the claims processing and information retrieval systemsutilized in the administration of State plans approved under title XIX* * *.'' SSA published an interim final rule (45 CFR 205.35 through 205.38)on September 30, 1981 (46 FR 47784) to implement this provision, and afinal rule on April 17, 1986 (51 FR 13001). The 90 percent FFP has beenavailable for quarters beginning on and after July 1, 1981. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposal </ITAG>AFDC agencies now receive 90 percent FFP for implementing eligibility determinationsystems. An automated eligibility determination system such as the AFDCFamily Assistance Management Information System (FAMIS), is in realitynot part of a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systemfor Medicaid. Congress purposely required that 90 percent FFP be made available for AFDCeligibility determination systems by adding section 403(a)(3)(B) of theAct, effective July 1, 1981, and did not do so for Medicaid. Any incentiveprovided by partial title XIX enhanced funding before 1981 has been supersededby the explicit funding authority under section 403(a)(3) of the Act. Thisauthority has encouraged 44 States to design eligibility determinationsystems, principally with title IV funding. Because there is no explicitstatutory funding authority under title XIX, HCFA is not required to makeenhanced FFP available for eligibility determination system. In addition,there is no further need to do so. As a result, we proposed that eligibility determination systems would nolonger be eligible for any enhanced FFP for Medicaid purposes under theproposed definition of mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystems, since enhanced FFP would be available only for costs directlyattributable to approved Medicaid systems. Because eligibility determinationsystems would not be used to process claims by ``providers of medical careand services for the medical care and services furnished to the recipients'',we would not require their implementation or operation, as part of thecore subsystems.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. FFP for an Eligibility Determination System </ITAG>We proposed that, in order to receive any FFP for Medicaid purposes foran eligibility determination system after the effective date of the finalrule, a State agency would have to submit an APD in accordance with therequirements of 45 CFR part 95, subpart F, for funding. If we approve theAPD, the State agency would receive 50 percent FFP for administrative costsunder section 1903(a)(7) of the Act for the system's design, development,installation, and operation. We proposed that a State Medicaid agency with a currently approved APDfor a mechanized eligibility determination system would receive Medicaidenhanced funding at 90 percent under paragraph 1903(a)(3)(A) of the Actuntil the effective date of these final regulations. Once these regulationsare effective, all Medicaid enhanced funding would terminate after theeffective date and Medicaid funding for operation of mechanized eligibilitydetermination systems would be reduced to the 50 percent rate under section1903(a)(7) of the Act at that time. Any APDs approved by HCFA for eligibilitydetermination systems after the effective date of the final rule wouldbe reduced to the 50 percent rate at that time. Eligibility determinationsystem operations being funded at the enhanced operations rate of 75 percentbefore the effective date of the final regulation would be funded by HCFAat the 50 percent rate after the effective date. We proposed to add a paragraph to andSection; 433.112 to exclude eligibilitydetermination systems specifically from funding at enhanced rates. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Comments and Responses </ITAG>We received comments from 29 commenters: 24 Medicaid agencies, one computercompany, one group for promoting technology to improve delivery of humanservices, a State Medicaid directors' association, a health center associationand the systems technical advisory group. Below we state their commentsand our responses to them. <T3>Comment: </T3>Almost all of the commenters disagreed with our proposalto stop paying enhanced FFP for State-initiated ``enhancements'' (or improvements)because they believed lack of enhanced FFP will prevent States from makingchanges, which contribute to the efficiency, effectiveness and economyof the program, to their systems. One of these commenters was also concernedabout a drop in funding for APDs that are already approved. Three commentersbelieved the change would affect Federal-State relationships; one commenterthought that the ability of States to share innovations would be hampered,thus reducing further chances at economy, efficiency and effectiveness.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that lack of enhanced FFP for State-initiatedenhancements may prevent some States from making important enhancementsthat will improve the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of their systems.Therefore, we will not delete the term ``enhancement'' found in andSection;433.111. Likewise, we will continue to fund enhancements based on APDsapproved by HCFA at enhanced funding levels, although we are consideringadditional options for matching rates paid for enhancements. (See sectionVIII below.) However, after the effective date of this regulation, enhancedfunding will not be available for eligibility determination systems, asthese systems are not part of mechanized claims processing and informationretrieval systems. With respect to APDs for eligibility determination systems approved beforethe effective date of this final regulation, in the interest of fairness,the 90-percent FFP rate will continue to be available for design, development,installation or enhancement of a system or subsystem up to the approvedexpenditure ceiling. However, FFP at 50 percent, not at 75, will be paidfor operation of eligibility determination systems after the effectivedate of the final regulation regardless of when the APD or system was approved.Any APDs or revisions to APDs approved after the effective date of thefinal regulation will be funded at the revised rate of 50 percent describedin the final regulation. We do not expect States to welcome a reduction of FFP rates for automatedeligibility determination systems under Medicaid. However, the Secretaryis obligated to interpret the statute and review and revise policy periodicallyif necessary. We do not believe that State staff reductions or increasederror rates can be directly attributed to this regulation or to the reducedFFP rates, particularly because the AFDC program will continue to fundthe development of automated eligibility systems at 90 percent FFP. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that a special HCFA work group isdeveloping basic requirements for an MMIS that will replace the generalsystems design and result in the removal from the State Medicaid Manualof the six core subsystems as they are known today: this activity is movingaway from the subsystem model while the proposed rule emphasizes the sixsubsystems exclusively. <T3>Response: </T3>While it is true that a work group is developing basicrequirements that will replace the general systems design and result inthe removal of the six core subsystems from the State Medicaid Manual,none of its work is final and we are not yet ready to propose such replacement.When any change is made in the MMIS, as a result of the work group's efforts,the requirements will be announced through appropriate documents. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters believed that we should add a definitionof ``maintenance'' to the rules; otherwise, the States and HCFA will continuallydisagree as to whether a change is maintenance or an enhancement. <T3>Response: </T3>We consider maintenance to be the routine operationalexercising and functioning of the system to keep it ready and fit for performingat the standard and condition for which it was approved. Enhancements advancethe system performance beyond its original condition. As defined in Departmentalregulations (45 CFR part 95, subpart F), enhancement means modificationsthat change the functions of software and hardware beyond their originalpurposes, not just to correct errors or deficiencies that may have beenpresent in the software or hardware, or to improve the operational performanceof the software or hardware. We are not revising our regulations to reflectthis explanation but will incorporate it into appropriate instructionsin the State Medicaid Manual. Furthermore, we will continue to pay enhancedFFP for State-initiated and Federally required enhancements to approvedMMIS systems. <T3>Comment: </T3>Ten commenters were concerned about funding for systemchanges required by statute that are not required by HCFA in regulation.Of special concern to several commenters was the fact that 90% FFP is availableonly after we have published the change in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and the State Medicaid Manual, which createsa lengthy delay in implementation because we do not retroactively approvesystem changes. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree with these commenters. We will fund at 90 percentFFP any enhancements to the required system that the statute requires,whether self-implementing or not. The State should implement any statutoryrequirements in the absence of implementing regulations. To the extentthat a State agency has to enhance the system again after we issue implementingregulations or instructions, we will also pay for those enhancements tothe required system at the 90 percent level. We are revising the definitionof ``Mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system'' inandSection; 433.111(b) to accommodate the changes.<T3>Comment: </T3>Eight commenters disagreed with the revisions to reducefunding to 50 percent based on the idea that Congress intended us to makefunding available at enhanced rates. (Three of the commenters were specificallyaddressing the revisions concerning eligibility determination systems.)The commenters contended either that we have not been authorized to discontinueenhanced funding or that the statute mandates implicitly enhanced FFP forsystem improvements, including eligibility determination systems. One ofthe commenters making the latter point indicated that we are required topay enhanced FFP for costs that are attributable to the design, developmentor installation or to the operation of a mechanized claims processing system.Some commenters argued that if we had the authority originally to fundenhancements and eligibility determination systems, we cannot now say wedo not have the authority to so fund.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not agree with these commenters. Congress hasprovided the Secretary with discretionary authority to fund such mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval systems ``as the Secretarydetermines'' are likely to provide more efficient, economical, and effectiveadministration of the State plan (section 1903(a)(3) of the Act.) Thissame discretionary authority exists under sections 403(a)(3) and 1903(a)(3)of the Act for the Secretary to define limits of the system and fund accordingly.The Secretary has determined that almost all State Medicaid programs haverealized a substantial benefit by initially implementing required MMISs.Congress has not provided explicit funding authority to Medicaid for eligibilitydetermination systems. Congress did provide explicit statutory authorityto title IV (section 403(a)(3) of the Act) and has required certain AFDCand Child Support Enforcement systems to be compatible with Medicaid systems.Title IV regulations (45 CFR 205.38) explicitly provide requirements forfunding and compatibility of the systems with Medicaid systems. Withinhis discretionary authority the Secretary has now determined that titleIV should fund these eligibility determination systems, not title XIX.Title XIX will provide 50-percent FFP for any Medicaid costs associatedwith eligibility determination.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters were concerned with the system performancereview (SPR) process and its relationship to noncore subsystems. They wonderedwhether future SPRs will be limited to core subsystems since the noncoresystems are not considered critical enough to be integral to the MMIS.<T3>Response: </T3>System performance review for reapproval is a reviewof the entire system for which FFP at any rate is claimed to determineif the system is likely to provide improved administration of the Stateplan. In many States the required subsystems make up the system. We expectthat any additional parts of the system, including those not required,will also be subject to review and reapproval to assure that Federal fundsare being properly claimed and spent and to assure that all parts of thesystem are cost beneficial and contributing to the proper and efficientadministration of the Medicaid program, as required by section 1902(a)(30)of the Act and other parts of State plan requirements. In addition, Departmentalrequirements at 45 CFR part 95, subpart F, are applied during all systemreviews. However, we will not review automated Medicaid eligibility determinationsystems as part of system performance review as these are not part of mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval systems.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters were concerned about the effect of therevisions on the third party liability (TPL) subsystem. They wanted toknow if the system will be eligible for enhanced funding, including bothHCFA-mandated and State-proposed enhancements to the subsystem.<T3>Response: </T3>Because of State comments on our proposal we will continueto offer enhanced funding for the design, development, installation orenhancement of the required system. Any State-initiated changes approvedafter this regulation becomes final will be funded at 90 percent for design,development and installation and at 75 percent for operations.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter had several specific questions concerningexpansion of current MMISs: (1) Would HCFA approve an APD requesting enhancedFFP for the enhancement/expansion of the core subsystems, yet disapprovesuch requests for the development of new and separate subsystems, keepingin mind that several States would incorporate a prior approval componentinto their claims processing subsystem and that a Risk Underwriting componentcould be included into the management and administrative reporting subsystem?(2) Will the operation of subsystems revised with 50 percent FFP be fundedat 75 percent or at 50 percent? (3) Would HCFA approve an APD for systemchanges to support a DRG reimbursement methodology at 90 or 50 percentFFP? (4) Will APDs for equipment or services where the total estimatedFederal and State funding for the acquisition is less than (a) $200,000over a twelve month period, (b) $300,000 for the total acquisition, or(c) $25,000, where the equipment/services are acquired noncompetitively,continue to be exempt from prior federal approval if the State claims 50percent FFP?<T3>Response: </T3>In response to the first two questions, all enhancementsto the required approved system will be funded at enhanced rates. Statesmay, based on an approved APD, install features that go beyond the definedMMIS and receive enhanced FFP for them. However, automated eligibilitydetermination systems will not be considered enhancements to the mechanizedclaims processing and information retrieval system. We expect States toidentify capabilities that uniquely serve that State and to reap administrativeand program savings from such optional capabilities. We are willing toshare in and support unique capabilities at the enhanced FFP rates forboth installation and operation of such optional capabilities.However, APDs for eligibility determination systems approved before theeffective date of the final regulation will be funded at the rates fordesign, development or installation in effect before the final regulationis effective. After the effective date of the regulations, APDs for eligibilitydetermination systems and all operations of those systems will be fundedby title XIX at the regular FFP rate of 50 percent. The title XIX costof projects for eligibility determination that are approved and begun afterthe regulation is effective will be shared equally by the States and bythe Federal Government.With respect to the third question, HCFA will pay for system changes tosupport a DRG reimbursement methodology at enhanced rates.The fourth question concerned thresholds and requirements for APD approvalsthat are in regulations, at 45 CFR part 95, subpart F.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters were concerned about the use of theMMIS for another program such as title XX and Medicare cross-over claims.<T3>Response: </T3>We did not intend to imply nor to propose that informationretrieved through the MMIS be used solely for Medicaid purposes. We meantthat payment of FFP is related to the extent the system is used solelyfor Medicaid purposes. If a system is used for title XX or XVIII purposesas well as title XIX, the cost of its operation would be prorated to eachprogram.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters believed that the MMIS should not belimited to six core subsystems, as to do so hampers the ability of theState to administer its program effectively and efficiently. One commenterthought it unfair that the State had implemented and operated an EPSDTsubsystem at enhanced rates but now would receive only 50 percent FFP.<T3>Response: </T3>We have changed our proposal and will continue enhancedfunding for EPSDT system functions if EPSDT subsystem functions are partof an approved system. The claims processing and followup portions of theEPSDT subsystem may be funded as part of an approved system, but not thosecase management functions that go beyond the concept of claims processingand information retrieval.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that our proposed revisions limiting75 percent FFP only to ``costs directly attributable to approved systems''conflict with the Grant Appeals Board decision that allowed for ``attributableindirect costs''.<T3>Response: </T3>The Department Appeals Board (DAB) decision No. 648,based on AT-78-33 and Transmittal 1 of the State Medicaid Manual (SMM),required payment of indirect costs not directly attributable to MMIS. TransmittalNo. 8 of the SMM (1986) rescinded AT-78-33 and superseded Transmittal No.1. The DAB decision No. 1023, March 13, 1989, upheld and confirmed thepolicy expressed in Transmittal No. 8 of the SMM. This regulation merelycodifies our policy of paying enhanced FFP only for costs directly attributableto systems approved under section 1903(a)(3) and (r).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the failure of the proposedrule to define the six required core subsystems; they should have beenset forth in the proposed rule instead of defined in the SMM.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not believe it is necessary or practical to namethe subsystems in regulations, rather than in the SMM. Without changingsubstantive system requirements, we are in the process of considering afuture conceptual revision of the MMIS to depart from the concept of subsystemand to include only two parts of a system as stated in the statute: namely,claims processing and information retrieval. These two parts would continueto contain all of the substantive content of the current six subsystemswith the first four: Recipient, Provider, Claims Processing and Referencecomprising the claims processing part and the other two reporting subsystems:Management and Administrative Reporting and Surveillance and UtilizationReview comprising the other part called information retrieval. This permitsabandoning the outmoded concept of ``subsystem'' without substantive changeto the system requirements. Any substantive change in the requirementswould be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believed that we should define ``MMIS''in regulations, rather than changing reference to it to ``system''.<T3>Response: </T3>``MMIS'' is the popular name for the system; the statutoryname for it is ``mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystem'', so we chose the more formal designation to parallel the law.<T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters had comments about APDs and paperworkburden. One commenter thought that States should not have to obtain HCFAapproval on enhancements. The commenters disagreed that our revisions wouldreduce the number of APDs generated, as the States would still have tocomplete APDs to determine whether a change is eligible for enhanced FFP;one commenter considered this illegal. One of the commenters disagreedthat preparing an APD is a waste of time, stating that it helps defineprojects for both the State and HCFA Regional Office.<T3>Response: </T3>The commenters are correct in stating that our revisionsdo not reduce the number of APDs generated and that the prepartion of anAPD is not a waste of time. However, we do not agree that requiring anAPD is illegal or that States should not have to obtain our approval onenhancements. An APD is required by 45 CFR part 95, subpart F for any expenditurefor systems regardless of matching rates if the amount is at or above aspecified threshold; the submission and approval of an APD is a requirementwithout regard to the matching rate.<T3> Comment:</T3> Seventeen commenters disagreed with our decision toreduce funding for eligibility determination systems for one or more ofthe following reasons:andbullet; They believed the statement HCFA made that a State Medicaid agency'sinvolvement in eligibility determinations is minimal is not true, and becomeseven less true as more and more legislation is passed that increases thenumber of Medicaid-only individuals. In their opinion, many ``Medicaid-only''determinations are not and will never be included under one of the integratedsystems with another agency. Estimated costs of eligibility determinationsfor Medicaid-only individuals ranged from 20 to 30.25 percent of the costof all eligibility determinations.andbullet; They believed that the eligibility determination system is anintegral part of a mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystem without which opportunities for abuse and errors increase and delaysin payment may result. They felt it is also essential to or indistinguishablefrom the recipient subsystem.andbullet; In their opinion, there will be no incentive to develop the systemwhere it does not yet exist (in some States) and systems will take longerto develop because of scarce resources.andbullet; It was the view of some that some MMIS functions may be accomplishedmore efficiently and at less cost in the eligibility determination systemthan in the MMIS; however, they furnished no data to substantiate theirview.andbullet; Although Congress did not explicitly authorize enhanced ratesfor a Medicaid eligibility determination system as it does for title IV,the commenters questioned whether Congress did not feel it was necessary,in view of the fact that we were already funding these systems at 90 percent.andbullet; They noted that title IV significantly limits costs that are reimbursableat 90 percent, whereas under existing regulations HCFA authorized all costsattributable to MMIS installation or design to be reimbursable at 90 percent.andbullet; They cited, in accordance with federal circular A-87, ``a costis allocable to a particular cost objective to the extent of benefits receivedby such objective'', and concluded that HCFA cannot cogently maintain thatcosts for eligibility determination systems should be funded under titleIV-A.<T3> Response:</T3> The commenters are correct that the enactment of severallaws during the last few years has added new groups of Medicaid eligiblesand that determination of eligibility for some of these groups is morecomplex than simply accepting the determinations of the AFDC and SSI programsthat make the determinations for the large majority of Medicaid eligibles.However, the legislation that added the new eligibles did not provide enhancedFFP for the determination of eligibility within the title XIX program forthese most recent groups of eligibles. As a result, title XIX can offeronly 50-percent FFP or regular administrative FFP for the cost of eligibilitydetermination for applicants. Once eligibility determinations are madethe input and use of data on the recipients by the approved MMIS systemmay be funded at an enhanced matching rate.We do not agree with commenters who believe abuse and errors will increaseunder the proposed revisions to the rules. The accuracy of eligibilitydeterminations is exclusively measured by the Medicaid eligibility qualitycontrol (MEQC) program and not by MMIS or SPR reviews. Congress set a 3percent threshold error rate for MEQC and the national average error ratewas 2.3 percent before eligibility determination systems began to be implemented.Few States exceed the threshold, and we expect this to continue. Also,there is no evidence that MMIS recipient eligibility files are updatedmore frequently or more quickly or accurately after an automated eligibilitydetermination system has been installed.We do not believe that incentives would no longer exist for States to developeligibility determination systems where they do not now exist. In 1981,Congress offered incentive funding under title IV for such systems, andthe need for Medicaid funding diminished, although the importance of thefunction and activity did not. (The incentive to design these systems isnow in title IV funding exclusively.) We now are withholding our formerstopgap funding because enhanced funding under title IV is available. TitleIV systems are being installed in most States and are required to be compatiblewith title XIX systems.As we noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, in the absence of enhancedfunding for eligibility determination systems in the late 1970's, we offeredpartial Medicaid funding to support the development of such systems. Althoughsome commenters believe that this may have influenced Congress to not enactlegislation on this subject, we disagree. We believe that if it had beenCongress' intent to have funding under both titles IV and XIX, they wouldhave so provided. Rather, our interpretation is that there is little pointin having two programs pay for the same activity.Commenters are correct in their observation that having two agencies addressthe same issue sometimes results in one limiting activities more than another.Under these rules, consistency will be achieved within the Department andthe title IV position will prevail. Since 1986 title IV has substantiallylimited enhancements or system changes for eligibility determination systemsto those required by statute or by the Secretary in regulations.Contrary to the view of the commenters, the Department does not expectcosts to shift between title IV and title XIX. Cost allocation methodswill remain the same. Under the current cost allocation plan title XIXpays only for functions that exclusively benefit the Medicaid program.Most State eligibility determination systems send data to MMIS recipientsubsystems on a regular basis. Few if any MMIS systems gain access to theeligibility determination systems directly during the processing of eachclaim. (One State was of the opinion that an eligibility determinationis unrelated to MMIS.) After this regulation is effective, a State withdirect access to an integrated eligibility system for purposes of processingMedicaid claims will receive an FFP rate of 75 percent (if the State hasan approved MMIS system) for the cost of gaining access to or obtainingthese data. There may be some Medicaid functions that are not related directlyto the MMIS that will be funded at 50-percent FFP, such as the determinationof eligibility for medically needy only.<T3> Comments:</T3> Ten commenters objected to the reduction of FFP foreligibility determination systems on the basis that their States have substantialsums invested in developing the systems and for which there is an approvedAPD.<T3>Response:</T3> In response to the commenters' concerns about the proposedrule, we are revising the regulations as proposed at andSection; 433.112(b)(6)to offer 90 percent FFP for developing an integrated eligibility determinationsystem when the APD was approved before the effective date of these finalrules, November 13, 1989. Any APDs or revisions to APDs approved afterNovember 13, 1989, will be funded at 50 percent. We are not, however, makingany revisions to our proposal to not offer 75 percent FFP for operatingan eligibility determination system after November 13, 1989, regardlessof the date the APD was approved.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters wanted to know whether the State AFDCand Food Stamp programs agree that it is their almost exclusive responsibilityto make Medicaid eligibility determinations and whether the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture and the Family Services Administration are willing to provideenhanced reimbursement for the full cost of all eligibility determinationfunctions.<T3>Response:</T3> The interagency agreements between HCFA and FSA andHCFA and USDA are not affected by this rule. The agreements establish auniform cost allocation system for use by States when apportioning thecost of their eligibility determination systems to a particular governmentagency. The FSA and USDA agree with this regulation, which affects onlythe amount allocated to HCFA. This rule will not affect the FSA or USDA.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter thought that we should continue yearlyreviews rather than once-every-three-years reviews as permitted by statute.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 1903(r)(4) of the Act was amended to permitreduction of yearly reviews for reapproval of systems to at least onceevery three years. HCFA proposed this reduction because State systems hadshown reduced deficiencies in reviews over the years, and because of reducedresources in HCFA and in the States for performing the reviews.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Revisions to Regulations</ITAG>We are adopting as final the revisions we proposed, with two exceptions.As a result of comments received, we are making the following changes:A. In andSection; 433.111, we are revising the definitions to clarify thatall enhancements to the required approved MMIS system are eligible forenhanced FFP. We are also clarifying that Medicaid eligibility determinationsystems are not enhancements.B. We are revising andSection; 433.112 so that APDs for eligibility determinationsystems that we have approved before the effective date of the regulationsremain eligible for any promised 90 percent. However, all 75 percent FFPfor operations of such systems will end on the effective date of the regulation.C. As a technical change, we are revising the proposed andSection; 433.119(c)to omit reference to the fiscal year as a review period. The initial purposeof the revisions to andSection; 433.119 was to allow for a review periodlonger than one year; the inclusion of ``fiscal year'' in paragraph (c)was inadvertent.D. As further technical changes, we conform the wording of andSection; 433.110to the statute and correct the name of the Departmental Appeals Board whereverit appears.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Notice</ITAG>HCFA has issued a Program Memorandum (PM 88-14, December 1988) and Transmittal10 to part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual (SMM) that offer enhanced fundingfor eligibility determination systems. This final regulation rescinds boththe provision of enhanced funding for eligibility determination systemsand any other conflicting policy, such as that contained in part 15 ofthe SMM.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Request for Comments</ITAG>Apart from excluding eligibility determination systems from the definitionof mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems, we arenot changing FFP rates for approved system enhancements from those currentlyin the CFR. However, in August 1989, after the end of the NPRM's commentperiod, the General Accounting Office issued a report entitled ``ADP Systems:Better Control Over States' Medicaid Systems Needed.'' The GAO believesthat enhancements are activities attributable to the operation of a system.The GAO thus recommended that 75%, rather than 90%, FFP should be providedto States for all approved enhancements to their systems. In light of theGAO report, we are studying its recommendations carefully. Given the recommendations,we may consider further options to change matching rates paid for enhancementsand we solicit further comment on this issue.We are publishing this as a final rule with comment in order to solicitcomments only on the GAO recommendation and its ramifications. If the GAOrecommendation is adopted, current regulations need to be changed to providefor 75% FFP for approved enhancements. In addition, HCFA would have toconsider what MMIS expenditures would remain eligible for 90% FFP. Oneinterpretation of section 1903(a)(3) of the Social Security Act to be consideredis that 90% FFP is available only for the initial ``design, development,or installation'' of a mechanized claims processing and information retrievalsystem. This interpretation would make 90% FFP available only for a State'sinitial establishment of such a system and not for subsequent modificationof a system or replacement of complete system. We solicit comments on thisinterpretation of the statute.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any final rule that meets one of the E.O.criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin_andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.There are currently 46 States and the District of Columbia that have acertified mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systemin operation. These States and the District of Columbia will not receiveenhanced FFP for those parts of their systems that do not fit the new definitionof ``mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems''.The provisions of this final rule differ from the proposed in that systemsapproved for 90 percent FFP before the effective date of these regulationswill continue to be eligible for this enhanced rate. In addition, thesefinal regulations provide for continued funding at 90 and 75 percent forState-initiated as well as Federally-mandated enhancements.We expect that some States will bear an increased share of data processingcosts, but we believe the increase will be a minimal burden to any singleState. This final rule does not meet the $100 million criterion nor dowe believe that it meets the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, thisfinal rule is not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and a regulatory impactanalysis is not required.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActWe generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Under the RFA, Statesare not considered small entities.In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to preparea regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may have a significant impacton the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Suchan analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. Forpurposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospitalas a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside of a MetropolitanStatistical Area.Since this rule will affect States, which are not considered small entities,we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule willnot be likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibilityanalysis.In addition, we are not preparing an analysis regarding small rural hospitalssince we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this finalregulation will not have a significant economic impact on the operationsof a substantial number of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
