CLIFFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Professor Josiah Thompson is an expert onsuch noted philosophers as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche _ and Sam Spade.   Spade? What in the name of Humphrey Bogart is going on here? Acareer change, that's what.   In 1976, Thompson, driven by a ``thirst for experience,'' lefthis tenured position as professor of philosophy at HaverfordCollege _ a prestigous Quaker school in Pennsylvania, came to SanFrancisco and became a private detective.   He couldn't have picked a better city in which to set up shop.   San Francisco's hills are steeped in the lore of DashiellHammett and his legendary sleuth, Sam Spade, the ``blond Satan''whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by Humphrey Bogartin ``The Maltese Falcon.''   There's even a bronze plaque on a San Francisco street,recalling a murder that took place only in Hammett's mind: ``Onapproximately this spot Miles Archer, partner of Sam Spade, wasdone in by Brigid O'Shaughnessy.''   Thompson, whose previous writings were mostly limited to theacademic world, has recounted his metamorphosis in a bookappropriately called ``Gumshoe: Reflections in a Private Eye''(Little, Brown, $17.95).   He was born 53 years ago in East Liverpool, Ohio, where hisfather sold dishes. During World War I, his father took a pair offield glasses from a dead German and gave them to the youngster.   Thompson, whose nickname is Tink, still uses the glasses oncases. He keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them onstakeouts.   Even though slightly built, he played halfback in high school,closing his eyes ``on every play.'' Later, he was under fire inLebanon as an ensign with a Navy Underwater Demolition Team, theelite Frogmen.   Why did he become a professor in the first place, going fromfootball bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of acollege campus?   ``I had plenty of money when I got out of the Navy, withdemolition and combat pay,'' he said. ``I was a good student inhigh school so I went to Oxford and from there took the line ofleast resistance.''   When that line became a cul-de-sac, he took a sabbatical andgrabbed a job with an established detective agency in San Francisco.   During his apprenticeship and as his own boss, Thompson hasworked on such headline cases as the defense of Black Panther HueyNewton on assault and murder charges, and the defense of Williamand Emily Harris in the Patty Hearst case.   There were also other, less publicized capers, ranging fromrecovering $30,000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drugcase to retrieving a kidnapped child from India.   Thompson's wife, Nancy, sells real estate. They have two adultdaughters and a son who plays soccer in college. He never carries agun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is ``mistakenidentity.''   ``I was taken for a spy on a case in Morocco,'' he said. ``Andone time in Canada, while working on a drug case, word got aroundthat a hit man was being brought in. When people heard I was fromCalifornia, some of them thought I was the guy. The bars wouldclear when I came in.''   While honing his skills as a gumshoe, Thompson has becomefascinated by Hammett and Spade, so much so that on one case hetook the time to interview some of Hammett's relatives.   Hammett, through Spade, was a bit of a philosopher, he says.   ``In order to love, one must put off hardness and shiftiness,''Thompson said. ``The ability to lie effectively, to appeardifferent than one really is, all the disguises essential in theworld of power, become, in the world of love, temptations, artfulexcuses to avoid the nakedness love requires, to avoid love.''   Hammett knew this, he said.   ``That's why in the last line of The Maltese Falcon he makesSpade `shiver' as he looks down the cold barrel of his future.''</TEXT></DOC>
