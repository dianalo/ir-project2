<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0941 </DOCNO><TEXT>The forest products industry in the Great Lakes region has realized thetremendous economic benefits of utilizing its wood wastes as fuel andhas rapidly converted to biomass technologies. However, other large commercial,industrial, and institutional energy users have been hesitant to installbiomass combustion equipment. Firms and institutions with non-seasonalrequirements for steam either in manufacturing processes or electricityproduction have been even more reluctant. The major reasons cited forthe lack of confidence in biomass combustion technologies include unreliablefuel availability, derated boiler output, unproven economics, and anunwillingness to experiment. Engineering assistance will be providedto one Great Lakes firm contemplating a biomass conversion. The firmselected for assistance will have a substantial non-seasonal processenergy load and a commitment to undertake the conversion. While fundingis being provided for technical assistance, the selected firm will payfor the biomass equipment and installation costs out of its own budget.After the client is selected, a preliminary technical and economic analysisof the proposed installation will be performed. Engineering specificationsfor the bidding process will be developed, and alternatives for financingwill be identified. South Alma Cheese Company of Alma Center, Wisconsin,has been selected as the industrial cooperator. The wood combustion systemhas been installed, and initial problems in the system have been workedout. Tours of the facility were held in the fall of 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
