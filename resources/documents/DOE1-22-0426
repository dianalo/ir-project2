Mathematical models of U(6), Pu(3), Pu(6), Np(6) extractionwith tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP) are improved. It is shown that when describingTBP uranyl nitrate extaction the carbon diluent individuality must betaken into account. An equation is given to describe the activity coefficientdependence {gamma}/sub +-/ on the effective ion force, the change ofphase volume is taken into account. A new mathematical model of Pu(4)distribution for cases of its presence in micro- and macroconcentrationsas well as for its mutual propagation with U(6) is suggested. The modelpresupposes the dependence of Pu(4) concentration extraction constanton the effective ion force. Models for U(4) and Np(4) are developed inthe analogous way. The application of the above models increases theaccuracy of data description by two times.</TEXT></DOC>
