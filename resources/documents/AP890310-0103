Troops today began moving out of some posts in the Jabaliya camp,which has 52,000 residents, and on Thursday began leaving the Shaticamp, where 42,000 Palestinians live, Palestinian witnesses andIsrael radio said.   Israel radio said the soldiers would be replaced by mobile units,deployed in less crowded areas, which could move quickly in case ofviolence.   Army officials said without eleaborating that the redeploymentwas aimed at reducing casualties in the 15-month Palestinianuprising.   The total number of soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip will notbe cut, but many combat soldiers will be replaced by border policetrained in riot control, an army spokesman said on condition ofanonymity.   The military moves came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left forthe United States on a 10-day visit. He is to meet with PresidentBush and Secretary of State James Baker.   Arens is expected to seek U.S. support for peace efforts thatfocus on an interim solution for the occupied territories. U.S.officials are expected to urge Israel to reduce the violence used insuppressing the 15-month Palestinian uprising.   At least 393 Arabs and 17 Israelis have died since thePalestinian rebellion against Israeli occupation began in December1987. The Israelis seized the lands from Arab neighbors in the 1967Middle East War.   The lastest death came Thursday when a 16-year-old Palestinianwas shot to death and 10 Arabs were wounded in clashes with Israelitroops.   Military officials believe removing permanently stationed unitsfrom the camps will lower tension.   ``The policy is now to reduce the hold, to reduce the frictionbetween Israeli forces and the local population,'' SouthernCommander Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai was quoted as saying inindependent Haaretz newspaper.   He added, however, that the new mobile army units will be readyto move ``to every place and at every moment to dispersedisturbances.''   The army plan also calls for border police to relieve infantryunits in densely populated Gaza City and the refugee camps ofNusserat and Bureij.   Army spokesman Maj. Moshe Fogel said the deployment ofhighly-trained border police will reduce the high number ofcasualties in demonstrations.   Elsewhere in Gaza today, the army destroyed rooms in the homes ofthree Palestinians from the Khan Yunis refugee camp who weresuspected of throwing firebombs at Arab collaborators, an armyspokesman said.   Palestinians shuttered their stores and transportation haltedaround the strip on the second day of commercial strikes.   A Palestinian human rights activist was freed from militarydetention in Israel one day before Amnesty International USA namedhim a ``prisoner of conscience.''   Zahi Jaradat of Saaer, a village in the West Bank, was releasedWednesday after a year in administrative detention, said an officialat Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group.</TEXT></DOC>
