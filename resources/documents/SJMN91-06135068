To help you sort itall out, this is the first of two columns offering information on what's newin cameras.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUYING A CAMERA: THE NEW FEATURES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Gadget GuruConsumer  </MEMO><TEXT>     (box) Olympus' new ultra-compact Stylus, not much larger than a pack ofcigarettes, is designed to fit into a pocket or purse and is one of thesimplest cameras ever invented.;    This unique camera is truly goof-proof. Totake a picture, just slide open the protective cover, look through theviewfinder to frame your subject and press the trigger. From that point on,its built-in circuitry takes over and makes all the necessary decisions foryou.;    For example: If you are shooting indoors and are unsure whether touse flash, not to worry. When you press the trigger, it automatically measuresthe available light and decides whether or not a flash is necessary. And toensure that &quot;red eyes&quot; are kept to a minimum, the flash strobes beforeshooting -- causing the pupils of the subject's eyes to contract and retainingthe eye's natural color.;    Olympus' new Stylus retails for $225. For a freebrochure (No. C806), call (800) 221-3000.;    (box) Although the Fuji PhotoFilm company is best known as a film manufacturer and the operator of thatother blimp, it also is making a name in the camera industry. Consider theDiscover Mini Dual Date camera.;    This camera has two interchangeable lenses-- a 45mm normal lens and a 28mm wide-angle lens. But probably the most uniquefeature found on this as well as many other Fuji cameras is its pre-windingfeature.;    When you place a fresh roll of film in the camera, thepre-winding feature automatically advances the film to the last frame on theroll. When shooting, it moves the film backward toward the front of the roll.Why is this a great feature? If the camera is accidentally opened while apartially used roll of film is inside, the pictures you have already takenwill not be exposed and be ruined. And no rewinding is necessary when you havefinished a roll.;    Fuji's Discover Mini Dual Date has a suggested retailprice of $260. For more information, call (800) 326-0800, extension 223.;   (box)  If you have ever been stuck taking pictures at a party, you'llappreciate Konica's Kanpai. This unit includes a miniature tripod and isdesigned to be placed in the corner of a room. When a party or get-together isin progress, its built-in microphone listens for bursts of sound (such aslaughter) and automatically pans and takes a picture. It then resets and pans,awaiting the next photo opportunity.;    The Kanpai retails for $216. For adealer near you, call (800) MY-KONICA.;    Note: Cameras are heavilydiscounted, so when you find one you like, shop around. You usually can findcameras retailing for about 35 percent below the manufacturers' suggestedretail price.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Andy Pargh column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910514  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  518  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 14, 199100135068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
