ZnO film appliedto the K-8 glass using the method of zinc reactive magnetron sputteringwas irradiated by 100 keV He/sup +/ ions. The film thickness constituted20 {mu}m and the length of SAW excited by collision-pin transformersis 37.5 {mu}m. It is shown that the measurement of SAW attenuation duringion implantation permits to judge on violation kinetics of piesodielectricemission layer stoichiometry. The measurement of SAW attenuation permitsto measure surface resistance of the layer during its irradiation andkinetics of its reduction. Together with measurement results of Auger-electronspectroscopy it provides additional information on the processes occurringin the emission layer.</TEXT></DOC>
