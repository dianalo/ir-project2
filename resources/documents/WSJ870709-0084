The move, which will take place in 1989, continues a trend of companies moving support staffs out of New York City.    Donaldson, a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., said the people to be moved are from its Pershing division, which provides clearing and trade-execution services for other brokerage firms.    &quot;In terms of economics it was very attractive to us,&quot; a Donaldson spokesman said. &quot;We save quite a bit.&quot; He wouldn't give a specific figure, but said the company would have an equity interest in the Cali project.    The spokesman said Donaldson doesn't plan to move other people out of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
