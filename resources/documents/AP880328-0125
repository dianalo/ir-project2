WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Gephardt, who fell short of the``Michigan miracle'' he needed to revive his candidacy, quit therace for the Democratic nomination today but said ``our effort wasnot in vain.''   Departing at an announcement on Capitol Hill, Gephardt continuedthe populist, anti-establishment flavor that he used on the stump.   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challengedthe Democratic Party and and called it back to its central role asan agent of fundamental change,'' he said.   Gephardt also updated the line that became the populist sloganof his campaign, ``It's your fight too.''   ``Whether the issue is trade or Social Security, Contra aid orthe environment, tax justice or corporate responsibility, yourfight will always be my fight too,'' Gephardt said.   Gephardt's candidacy limped out of the South on Super Tuesdaythree weeks ago, having never received the beneficial momentum hehad expected from Iowa.   Gephardt had looked to Michigan's caucuses last Saturday,figuring that auto-industry state would provide a most receptiveear for his call for trade retaliation against countries that don'topen markets to U.S. products.   He asked for a ``Michigan miracle.'' Instead he got a distantthird place finish behind Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.   ``It's been said the opera isn't over until the fat ladysings,'' Gephardt said. ``Last Saturday in Michigan I think I heardher walking to the microphone.''   Gephardt's campaign blossomed in the lead-off delegate event,Iowa's caucuses, where his tough talk on trade caught on with thestate's Democrats. He won again in South Dakota, but on SuperTuesday he failed to win anywhere other than his home state ofMissouri.   Gephardt said he would file for re-election to his House seatfrom Missouri. ``I hope to carry their cause as a member ofCongress, and tomorrow I'm filing for re-election,'' he said.   Aides said Gephardt did not intend to try to preserve thedelegates he had already won as a bloc by continuing his campaignin a suspended state.   He spent Sunday at home in seclusion at his suburban Virginiawith family and advisers. Aides were silent about what went on, butas early as last week they had said privately that he would dropout if he didn't make a strong showing in Michigan's Democraticcaucuses. He finished a distant third in Saturday's contest.   Going into Michigan, Gephardt indicated it was a do-or-die statefor him, but said he believed his prospects were good. Michigan isan industrial and union state that offered as receptive an audiencefor his tough talk on trade as Gephardt was likely to find anywhere.   Gephardt's last campaign speech was in Milwaukee, beforeWisconsin Democrats who vote next Tuesday. He delivered it as thesize of his Michigan defeat was becoming clear.   ``All things considered, I'd rather be back in Des Moines,''said Gephardt, who won Iowa's lead-off caucuses but was unable toconvert that into victories in other states aside from his ownMissouri and in South Dakota.   Even in Iowa, Gephardt's candidacy was slipping away.   At county conventions there over the weekend, follow-ups to theprecinct caucuses in February, Gephardt lost supporters to Dukakis,and Jesse Jackson gained ground as well.   ``I think people see that Gephardt is pretty much out of it,''said Tom Mann, a state senator from Des Moines who backed Jackson.   Gephardt had won 167 delegates through 31 contests, fallingbehind even Sen. Paul Simon, who was not a factor on Super Tuesdayand only stayed in the race because he won his home state ofIllinois.   His delegates, where people have actually been selected to fillthose slots, would become free to do as they wished if Gephardtpulled out of the race. In states where no people had been selectedyet to fill delegate slots won by Gephardt, his delegate sharewould be reallocated among the other candidates depending on staterules.   Gephardt surged to the top of the Democratic field in Iowa withsavvy television ads and a tough, pointed campaign message blamingunfair trade practices for much of the nation's economic difficulty.   But his win in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8 didn't provide the``bounce'' that he hoped for in the states that followed.   ``Gephardt got very little momentum out of Iowa,'' saidDemocratic Party professional Elaine Kamarck. Pat Robertson'ssurprise second-place finish over George Bush on the Republicanside dominated the news.   Gephardt lost everywhere on Super Tuesday except for ahomes-state win in Missouri. He was pounded across the South in awithering crossfire of negative television ads by both Dukakis andSen. Albert Gore Jr.   Gephardt delivered strongly stated populist, anti-establishmentthemes. But his message had a fundamental negativism to it _ atevery speech he declared that America was ``in decline.''   His depiction of himself as battling the establishment alsobrought an undercutting skepticism from those who knew him as theconsummate Washington insider. Some critics called his message``pseudo-populism.''   When he tried to resuscitate his campaign in the Northernindustrial states, organized labor did not provide backing. A daybefore Michigan's caucuses, he asked UAW members at a rally inFlint to deliver a ``Michigan miracle.''   But the UAW in Michigan was splintered, with many of therank-and-file members backing Jackson. When UAW president OwenBieber appeared with Gephardt two days before that state'scaucuses, his unwillingness to offer an endorsement underscoredGephardt's problem.   Gephardt formally declared his candidacy on Feb. 23, 1987, buthe had begun campaigning more than a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
