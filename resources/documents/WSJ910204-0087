As Taiwan prepared for the move last year, the prospect ofinvesting in the world's largest closed market excited fundmanagers. But the complicated rules issued in late Decemberare causing many institutions to think twice before applyingfor a slice of the $2.5 billion that will be allowed into thecountry.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a positive thing that they're going ahead with theliberalization of their market,&quot; said Mark ten Hove, seniorfund manager at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong.&quot;But fund managers would like to see maximum flexibility.We're definitely not there yet.&quot;   Potential investors are most troubled by limitations oncapital movements that the government has imposed in itsregulations, limitations that they say are absent from otherinternational markets. Fund managers also face restrictionson non-equity investments that could prevent them even fromobtaining market rates on funds deposited in bank savingsaccounts. In addition, investors are nervous about the Taiwanmarket's strict settlement procedures, which carry the threatof harsh punishment if breached just once.   With such complications, foreign fund managers aren'tleaping at the opportunity to invest. In addition, investmentmanagers say that other countries, particularly the rapidlyindustrializing nations of Southeast Asia, offer betterprospects this year and next. Moreover, these foreigninstitutional investors remain wary of the Taiwan market'snotorious volatility.   David Webb, a fund manager at Hambro Pacific FundManagement Ltd. in Hong Kong, said he has no plans to enterthe Taiwan market. &quot;It's a combination of not really beingcomfortable with the way the market is run and, secondly, theeconomic fundamentals don't warrant us being that aggressivein investing there.&quot;   The only application so far to invest in Taiwan reinforcesthe general wariness investors are feeling. The applicationis for a proposed $50 million closed-end mutual fund thatJardine Fleming Securities Ltd. plans to list on the HongKong Stock Exchange. Several fund-management firms affiliatedwith brokerage houses are looking into similar listedvehicles, as well as private institutional funds. But brokerssay many fund managers who originally hoped to make their owndirect portfolio investments now are backing off.   Under the market-opening regulations, such foreigninstitutional investors as pension funds, insurancecompanies, banks and professional fund managers are permittedto apply to invest between $5 million and $50 million. Undercertain circumstances, investments as large as $100 millionmay be approved.   The biggest obstacles for many institutions are the rulesgoverning the flow of foreign capital in and out of Taiwan.The regulations require all funds to be remitted to Taiwanwithin three months after an investment application isapproved. Moreover, all principal must remain locked up inTaiwan for at least three months. Finally, the rulesstipulate that capital gains on investments may berepatriated only once a year.   The rules, which are widely thought to be aimed atdiscouraging short-term stock trading and foreign-exchangespeculation, also will prevent most U.S. fund managers frominvesting in Taiwan because their corporate guidelines ortrustee agreements prohibit restricted access to fundcapital. Moreover, a broker with a major Japanese securitiesfirm said rules maintained by Japan's Ministry of Financewill prevent some Japanese institutions from investing underTaiwan's terms.   Fund managers prepared to accept the capital restrictionsmay then face problems with the avenues of investmentprovided for in the regulations. Besides the stock market,the government will allow investment in government andcorporate bonds and other long-term instruments. Butfinancial instruments with a maturity of less than one yearare off limits, including money-market accounts andcertificates of deposit.   No final decision has been made about the type of bankaccounts that fund managers will be able to use for theircash positions, but the authorities are signaling thatinvestors will be allowed interest rates of only about 2%.That would be less than the current rate on demand savingsaccounts of about 5.5%.   Beyond the regulations, investors must also deal with theTaiwan Stock Exchange's strict settlement rules. All tradeson the Taiwan exchange must be settled one day after they areinitiated, which is among the fastest settlements of anymarket in the world, brokers say. Failure to complete anytransaction can mean suspension of trading privileges forthree years.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Tokyo stocks closed weaker but above intraday lows Friday.Without buying incentives, light selling by long-terminvestors was able to depress the major index gradually fromthe morning opening, traders said.
