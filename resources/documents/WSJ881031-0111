The computer subsidiary, known as NAS, has been a drain on National's earnings in recent quarters due to steep price-cutting in the mainframe computer market and the increased strength of the Japanese yen. The NAS unit sells mainframe computers and peripheral devices made by Japan's Hitachi Ltd.    By selling the NAS unit, National would be departing from its strategy of focusing on both microchips and computers. Over the last several years, National executives have often extolled the fast growing computer unit as a shield from the recessions that frequently beset the chip industry. Crosstown rival Intel Corp., for instance, continues to expand its computer operations for that reason.    At National's annual meeting here Friday, senior company officers declined to comment on the rumored sale. But analysts said that the executives sent strong signals that a deal is brewing. At a gathering of securities analysts following the meeting, National Semiconductor didn't mention its microchip/computers dual strategy. In fact, the company didn't even make a formal presentation on NAS, which accounted for more than one-third of National's $2.47 billion of revenue in the fiscal year ended May 29.    Instead, Charles Sporck, National's president and chief executive officer, focused on the company's huge semiconductor operations. His speech included previously undisclosed details on the size and profitability of National's various chip lines.    &quot;The bad news is that most analysts were hoping they would announce the imminent sale of NAS,&quot; said Drew Peck, chip-industry analyst with Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;The good news is that they were more candid than ever before about their semiconductor sales.&quot;    According to another industry analyst, who declined to be named because he said he is privy to the NAS talks, National has contacted a number of U.S. computer-equipment makers about selling NAS. He declined to specify which ones. The negotiations are particularly touchy, he said, because Hitachi, whose product contracts with NAS are the unit's most valuable asset, must support any proposed deal.    &quot;Hitachi could pull the plug on NAS and simply shift its next generation of products to another company,&quot; said the analyst. &quot;National needs Hitachi's cooperation to get a good price (for the unit.)&quot;   Analysts put the price of NAS at between $250 million to $400 million. Mr. Peck said National would do well to get half of the unit's annualized revenue, based on results from its fiscal first quarter ended August 28. That price, he said, would be roughly $350 million.    Several analysts said Mr. Sporck's detailed comments Friday on National's chip lines were meant to pave the way for the sale of NAS. The chief executive said all of National's major chip segments are profitable, except for certain operations which make microprocessors and customized chips, called ASICs. But Mr. Sporck said he expects the ASIC group to reach profitability in January, and the microprocessor division to do so during National's current fiscal year.    &quot;Most analysts had thought that all their semiconductor groups were only marginally profitable,&quot; said Mr. Peck. &quot;Now it seems their level of profitability is high but for a few key products.&quot;    At the meeting, Mr. Sporck also said that National, as with other chip makers, is seeing new orders slowing down markedly, especially from desktop-computer makers. He said this could hamper results in coming quarters, but he predicted that the company's current fiscal period, ending Nov. 30, would be &quot;considerably better&quot; than its last quarter.    For its first quarter, National posted a loss of $30.5 million, compared to profit of $13.5 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $649.4 million, up 25% from $517.6 million a year earlier. The first-quarter loss included a pretax charge of $16.6 million from the restructuring of parts of the company's computer operations.    ---              National Semiconductor's Revenue              From its Chip and Computer Units           For the year ending in May, in millions                       Semiconductor          Information                               Group        Systems Group    1988                    $1,400.0             $1,100.0    1987                       976.9                891.0    1986                       837.8                640.3    1985                     1,152.7                634.8    1984                     1,102.5                552.6</TEXT></DOC>
