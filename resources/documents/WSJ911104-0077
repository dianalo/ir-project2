The 45.45 billion ringgit ($16.5 billion) budget, up 18%from this year's spending plan, is designed to ease thetransition to industries with greater export capabilities.The plan abolishes tax breaks for firms with five-year&quot;pioneer&quot; status, pivotal in transforming theagriculture-based economy to one led by manufacturing.Inducements such as tax abatements for export performancewill be given only to firms at least 70%-owned by Malaysians.To encourage investment in high-risk businesses based on newand sophisticated technology, venture-capital firms will beoffered tax incentives.   To curb consumer spending, import duties will be raised onitems such as cigarettes, liquor and gold. To raise morerevenue, the 5% service tax will be expanded to coverprofessional services, and despite a labor shortage, a levywill be imposed on foreign workers.   Kuala Lumpur said the budget was intended to sustainMalaysia's growth with price stability, improve the balanceof payments, encourage greater savings and enhance economicresilience.                                                                                                          ASIAN NATIONS' BORROWING SURGES                                                                                                          The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentsaid seven Asian economies remain the biggest non-OECDborrowers, reflecting their continuing brisk expansion. HongKong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia andThailand raised about $13.5 billion in world capital marketsin the first nine months, compared with the $14.3 billiontotal for all of last year; the 1991 total could reach $19billion. Their borrowing represented 56% of the $24 billiontotal for all developing countries in the latest nine-monthperiod.                                                                                                          BUDAPEST SELLS OFF A MINE   Hungary sold the northern Dorog Coalmines in what the MTInews agency said was the country's first miningprivatization. Hungarian entrepreneurs, headed by a privateinvestment group named Hepta, bought a 54% stake in the mine,to be operated as a corporate entity after 45 years of stateadministration. The remaining 46% is held by the mine's 13largest creditors, including state agencies. Dorog Coalmineswas capitalized at 1.4 billion forints ($18.3 million). Ofthe 2,300 employees, 90% are to be retained.                                                                                                          INDIA OPENS ARMS-EXPORT DRIVE                                                                                                          India launched a major arms export drive, targetingcountries with economies weaned from dependence on the ailingSoviet Union. The campaign has an annual target of $384million, up sharply from India's military sales of $52.6million last year. New Delhi began consultations with Sovietconcerns about setting up joint defense ventures indeveloping countries and exporting Soviet-made gear fromIndia. Nations using Soviet equipment have appealed to Indiasince Moscow began demanding hard currency for arms.                                                                                                          SINO-EC BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH                                                                                                          China and the European Community inaugurated abiotechnology research center they will jointly fund andoperate in Beijing. An accord to establish the center wasreached in 1986. Last year, the EC lifted most political andeconomic sanctions imposed on China for suppressing ademocracy movement in 1989.                                                                                                          BULGARIANS PUT LOCK ON REACTOR                                                                                                          Despite an energy crunch caused by a Sovietelectricity-supply suspension, Bulgaria won't permitoperation of one of two 1,000-megawatt reactors at theKozlodui nuclear plant. Sofia cited a lack of qualifiedspecialists. The plant, now operating at less than halfcapacity, consists of four of the oldest Soviet-type440-megawatt reactors and the two more-advanced models.Global nuclear regulators have said the older generators areoutdated, unsafe and almost beyond repair. At full capacity,the plant could provide about 40% of Bulgaria's electricityneeds.                                                                                                          BRAZIL AUCTIONS ANOTHER FIRM                                                                                                          Brazil sold a jet-engine maintenance company, Celma, thesecond auction under a contested privatization campaign.   The bidding Friday by Brazilian and foreign investors atRio de Janeiro's stock exchange was calm and orderly, inmarked contrast to the violence-marred auction of theUsiminas steel mill Oct. 24 that inaugurated the drive tosell 27 government-owned companies.   Brasilia received about $93.8 million for Celma, or 25%more than the official minimum. The government had offered89.14% of Celma common stock for a base price of $74.3million. Foreign investors acquired 12.6%, far less thantheir 40% ceiling. Celma has 1,500 employees.   With inflation soaring to 30% a month, Brazilian PresidentFernando Collor de Mello denied rumors last week that thegovernment would freeze prices in an economic shock plan. Healso sent to Congress a tax reform bill to increase leviesproportionately to rising incomes and to combat tax evasion.
