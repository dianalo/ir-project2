Each comment should include the name and addressof the person submitting the comment, refer to the docket number [CGD 87-069]of this advance notice, identify specific issues of this advance noticeto which each comment applies, and give reasons for the comments. Receiptof comments will be acknowledged if a self-addressed post card or envelopeis enclosed with the comments. All comments received before the expirationof the comment period will be considered before further action is taken.No public hearing is planned, however, one may be held at a time and placeto be set in a later notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>if written requests for a public hearing arereceived and the Coast Guard determines that the opportunity to make oralpresentations will aid in the rulemaking process. Interested persons may also participate in the portions of this regulatoryaction concerning coal transportation by attending meetings of the ChemicalTransportation Advisory Committee, Subcommittee on Coal Transportation.These meetings, held in Washington, DC, are open to the public and areannounced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Subcommittee was formed to aid the CoastGuard in developing regulations for the safe carriage of coal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this advance notice are Mrs.Dawn Anderson, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, ProjectCounsel, Office of Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Discussion </ITAG>Bulk solid hazardous materials include those materials grouped into a numberof specific classes, the definitions of which are contained in the Departmentof Transportation Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 170-189), andalso those materials which are hazardous only in bulk, primarily due totheir tendency to spontaneously generate heat. A bulk solid hazardous materialthat is not listed in 46 CFR 148 may only be transported by water if theCoast Guard issues a Special Permit setting forth transportation requirements.Currently there are several standard permits which are issued by the CoastGuard on a regular basis. The international standard for the marine transport of these materialsis the IMO Bulk Solids Code. While the Bulk Solids Code currently is arecommended standard, several countries have adopted it as national regulations.Additionally, amendments have been proposed to Chapter 6 of the InternationalConvention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended, (SOLAS 74/83),to adopt certain general requirements of the Bulk Solids Code as part ofthe Convention. Of course, if adopted, the proposed amendments to SOLAS74/83 would become mandatory for those countries signatory to the Convention,including the United States. As a result of the above, many internationalshipments already comply as a matter of practice with the requirementsof the Bulk Solids Code. The amendments being considered would revise 46 CFR 148 by adding cargoescurrently carried under Coast Guard Special Permit and cargoes includedin the IMO Bulk Solids Code, including coal, to the list of permitted cargoes.The Special Permit requirements and requirements of the IMO Bulk SolidsCode would be included in the regulations. Lastly, the amendments wouldeliminate conflicts and vagaries in the current regulations. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking is intended to provide industryand interested parties the opportunity to comment at this early stage inthe rulemaking process on how best to conform domestic regulations to existingpractice and the proposed amendments to SOLAS 74/83, if adopted. The CoastGuard invites comments on all aspects of the marine transportation of bulksolid hazardous materials, and particularly on the following topics. 1. How can the present regulations be changed to improve the clarity ofthe regulations and the level of safety they provide? 2. What are the requirements that need to be added to the current specialpermit requirements to ensure adequate safety of the vessel and its crew?What Special Permits requirements are unnecessary for safety? The following materials are being considered for inclusion in 46 CFR 148:A. Materials currently shipped under Special Permit: a. Ammonium Nitrate Phosphate_containing 70-90% ammonium nitrate and notmore than 0.4% combustible material. b. Ammonium Nitrate_fertilizer grade_as defined in 49 CFR 173.182 footnoteandplusmin;1. c. Charcoal breeze. d. Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)_hot molded briquettes. e. Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)_lumps, pellets and cold molded briquettes.f. Ferrosilicon_containing 45-70% silicon. g. Ferrous Sulfate.h. Hazardous Waste, Solid_designated as such by the EPA. i. Linted Cotton Seed. j. Uncalcined Petroleum Coke_at or above 130 anddegrees;F. k. Zinc Skimmings. B. Materials currently listed in the IMO Bulk Solids Code (these materialsdo not include those already covered by Special Permit): a. Aluminum Ferrosilicon, powder. b. Aluminum Silicon, powder, uncoated. c. Castor Beans. d. Coal. e. Fluorspar (Calcium Fluoride). f. Iron Oxide, spent: Iron Sponge, spent. g. Metal Sulfide Concentrates. h. Pitch Prill, Prilled Coal Tar, Pencil Pitch. i. Seed Cake_containing oil. j. Silicomanganese. k. Vanadium Ore. l. Wood Pulp Pellets, Woodchips. 3. Which, if any, of the materials listed above can be carried safely withoutdetailed requirements? 4. Which, if any, of the above materials should continue to be consideredon a case by case basis and authorized only through the issuance of a SpecialPermit? Why? 5. Which of the above materials are currently being transported in bulkby water?  6. Are there any materials not listed above or in 46 CFR 148 which shouldbe regulated for bulk transport by water? What are they and why shouldthey be regulated? The amendments being considered would include the following requirementsof the IMO Bulk Solids Code in 46 CFR 148, in order to conform U.S. regulationswith existing practice and proposed revisions to Chapter 6 of SOLAS 74/83:a. General loading and unloading requirements; b. Provision of information by the shipper, to the master, regarding thenature of the material, chemical hazards, flow moisture point, moisturecontent, stowage factor, and angle of repose; c. Trimmimg procedures, including suggested methods for determining theangle of repose, moisture content and flow moisture point of the material;and d. Precautions to be taken when poisoning or asphyxiation hazards are present.7. What requirements, if any, in addition to the requirements of the IMOBulk Solids Code being considered for inclusion in Part 148 are necessaryto ensure safety? 8. Amendments being considered include the addition of a list of non-hazardousbulk materials, which would not be subject to the regulations developed,and a list of solid materials too hazardous to be carried in bulk. Shouldsuch lists be included? If so, what materials should be included in eachlist? 9. Which, if any, of the current regulations, or the amendments being considered,are too restrictive for application to unmanned barges trading solely onthe inland waters of the U.S.? Why are they too restrictive? What alternativeswould provide for an adequate level of safety? <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Economic Analysis and Certification </ITAG>At this early stage in the rulemaking process, the Coast Guard anticipatesthat its final rules will not be considered major under Executive Order12291, or significant under the Department of Transportation regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The primary economic impact of the amendments under consideration wouldbe on shippers and carriers of solid hazardous materials in bulk. However,since the IMO Bulk Solids Code has already been adopted by several countries,most U.S. export shipments are already in compliance with many of the amendmentsbeing considered. The amendments being considered would actually simplifyexport shipments by harmonizing U.S. regulations with international standards,alleviating the need to comply with two separate standards. Since the purpose of the amendments under consideration is simply to consolidateand update existing regulations, and to conform the regulations to existingpractice, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, they will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.At this time the economic impact of the amendments being considered isanticipated to be minimal. If the Coast Guard learns that the financialimpact of these regulations, if adopted, would be more than minimal, adetailed regulatory evaluation will be performed at that time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Under present regulations shippers must apply for a special permit to shipany bulk solid hazardous material not listed in 46 CFR 148. These permitsexpire after two years and a new application, along with a record of theshipping history, must be submitted and approved for the continued shipmentof the material. The amendments being considered would eliminate the needto apply for (and therefore the need to renew) special permits for mostmaterials. Materials newly classified as hazardous and those shipped infrequentlywould still require a special permit. Approximately 15 requests are receivedannually, either for new permits or renewals. These requests, and the recordkeepingnecessary for permit renewal, will be eliminated by the amendments underconsideration. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Statement </ITAG>This advance notice of proposed rulemaking has been analyzed in accordancewith the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, andit has been determined that the concepts discussed herein do not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.D.
