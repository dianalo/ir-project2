He was 50.   Tibetan Buddhism's second ranking religious leader died Saturdayof a heart attack in Xigaze, China's official Xinhua news agencyreported.   At the time of his death, the 10th Panchen Lama was vice chairmanof the National People's Congress, China's parliament, and honorarypresident of the Chinese Buddhists' Association.   He lived in Beijing but had traveled to Xigaze to officiate atthe opening of a rebuilt great stupa, the shrine that containsremains of the fifth to ninth panchen lamas.   It had been destroyed and the remains defiled during the 1966-76Cultural Revolution, when Chinese leftists destroyed temples andpersecuted many religious Tibetans.   Unlike his superior, the Dalai Lama who fled into exile after a1959 uprising against the Chinese, the Panchen Lama stayed andbacked the Chinese. But he refused to denounce his self-exiledspiritual mentor and was caught in a dilemma of being trusted byneither side.   He also presented a dilemma to Tibetans, especially after hebecame China's chief Tibetan spokesman for Sino-Tibetan unity anddenied charges by Tibetan exiles that their people continue to bearrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to Chinese rule.   ``Although he has been a collaborator with the Chinese, weconsider him a true Tibetan because he had no choice,'' said arefugee in Dharmsala, the Indian home-in-exile to the Dalai Lama andsome of the 100,000 Tibetans who fled with him.   On Sunday, exiles walked the streets of the city in a teary-eyeddaze and shopkeepers lowered their shutters in honor of the dead man.   Despite his support for the communists, the Chinese jailed thePanchen Lama for 20 months during the Cultural Revolution and kepthim under house arrest for nine years. He was allowed to return toTibet only in 1982.   In the past several years, however, he began openly discussingthe sufferings of Tibetans since the communist army occupied thesparsely populated mountain area in 1950.   One of his strongest statements came last week. On Wednesday, twoofficial Chinese dailies quoted him as saying Tibetans have paid toohigh a price for their development under the Chinese.   He said Chinese communists' mistakes were greater than theirsuccesses in Tibet. Some officials ``had completely forgotten thetragedy (of the Cultural Revolution) and others had even begun torepeat the mistakes,'' he said.   The Panchen Lama also echoed the position of the Dalai Lama incalling for more autonomy for Tibetans.   The Dalai Lama has been recognized from the 15th century as thespiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet, which remained a theocracyuntil 1950. The Panchen Lama traditionally held the powerful post ofchief abbot of the Tashi Lump Monastery near Xigaze, Tibet's secondlargest city.   Kesang Tseten was born in February 1938 in Qinghai, the provincenortheast of Tibet which also has a large Tibetan population. At age3, he was named by Tibetan religious leaders as one of threecandidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth PanchenLama, who died in 1937.   After several years of wrangling, and championed by the Chinesecommunists, Kesang was approved as the 10th Panchen Lama on June 3,1949.   It could take several years to determine the 11th Panchen Lama.</TEXT></DOC>
