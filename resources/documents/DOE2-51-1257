The results showthat there are two processes in the structure changes of B{sub 2}O{sub3} glass with temperature increasing. Above 430 {sup 0}C, and increasingnumber of bonds begin to snap off and the number of boroxol rings isreduced accordingly. Above 600 {sup 0}C, a chain-like structure is formed,which is composed of B{sub 2}O{sub 3} bipyramids. Above 930 {sup 0}C,this chain-like structure is broken to give B{sub 2}O{sub 3} molecules.</TEXT></DOC>
