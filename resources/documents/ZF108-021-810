 Those advances will pave the way for developers to move themission-critical and distributed applications of mini and mainframe descentdown to familiar PC territory.andM;&quot;Applications in the '90s will blend the desire for shared data and fastcommunication of data that is common in the mainframe world with theindividualism of the PC,&quot; said Rich Finkelstein, president of PerformanceComputing Inc., a database consulting firm in Chicago.andM;Banking systems and insurance-processing applications, which havetraditionally donned the limited character-based mask of mainframe terminals,will take on new voice and image-processing capabilities as they are moved tothe interactive world of PCs, Finkelstein said.andP;  For example, a PC bankingapplication of the future could sport a graphical user interface for easymanipulation, provide greater security through signature analysis and offerfinancial-planning tips through a built-in expert system, he explained.andM;Object-oriented programming will be a primary catalyst in the creation ofthis new generation of applications.andP;  While traces of OOP will touch nearlyevery PC language, its initial impact is already being felt with C, whereheadway has been made with C++.andM;&quot;I think the world is already looking ahead to C++,&quot; said Gene Wang, directorof product management for languages at Borland International Inc. of ScottsValley, Calif.andP;  &quot;The fundamental belief is that C++ will replace C as theprofessional development language for serious programmers in the '90s.&quot;andM;As programming tools grow in sophistication and reduce the amount of new coderequired, a new breed of developer will be charged with buildingapplications.andM;&quot;With more sophisticated OOP and CASE front-end workbenches, there isvirtually no code in the future, reducing the need for programmers,&quot; saidCary Prague, assistant director of the finance division at The TravelersInsurance Co. in Hartford, Conn.andP;  &quot;Instead, a super breed of systemanalyst/application designer will emerge to spearhead these applications.&quot;andM;Another key to developing the next generation of applications will beprovided by RAD, a &quot;SWAT-team&quot; approach advocated by information-engineeringexpert James Martin that promises to reduce the backlog of applications andto speed the development process.andP;  RAD calls for the coordinated use of CASEtools by topnotch software developers overseen by efficient managementtechniques.andP;  Initial studies by Martin have found a 4-1 productivity gainusing the RAD strategy.andM;OOP technology will assist the professional developer in creatingapplications, yet it also promises to give users more flexibility inconfiguring their programs.andM;&quot;If we had object-oriented applications, things would be more modular,&quot; saidMitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp. and now head of ON TechnologyInc., a Cambridge, Mass., software company.andP;  &quot;It would allow users to buy aword processor, replace its outliner, plug in a new spell checker, or addimages and voice.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
