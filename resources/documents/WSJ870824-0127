L.P. said it is seeking permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell certain nonproducing energy properties for $28 million in cash and stock, to help make its distributions and reduce bank debt.    The energy limited partnerhip said it proposes initially to sell about $28 million of properties in two stages to its general partner, Apache Corp., a Denver-based energy exploration and production company. The properties are mostly nonproducing natural gas sites in Oklahoma on which the limited partnership is paying lease rentals, but it doesn't have enough cash flow with which to drill and meet its quarterly cash distributions. Apache Petroleum reduced its quarterly payouts twice last year, to 17.5 cents a unit from 52.5 cents.    The properties have proven but undeveloped energy reserves, Apache Petroleum said. If the SEC approves, Apache Petroleum would receive $20 million in cash and $8 million in Apache common stock. The sales would begin later this year, followed by another sale in 1988, and other possible sales during a five-year period.    Proceeds would also be used to retire some bank debt, Apache Petroleum said. Its long-term bank debt was $315 million at June 30 from a group of lenders led by First RepublicBank Dallas, a unit of First RepublicBank Corp.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Apache Petroleum closed at $7.25, up 12.5 cents, and Apache Corp. shares closed at $11.375, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
