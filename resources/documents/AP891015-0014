Flooding the banking system with money could reduce the riskthat Friday's 190-point fall in the Dow Jones average will turninto a more serious financial disaster on Monday, the WashingtonPost and the New York Times reported.   ``Markets will be able to count on us to make sure the financialsystem stays fluid,'' the Times quoted an unidentified official ofthe Federal Reserve Board as saying.   On Monday, ``it should be quite evident to the market that wewill satisfy liquidity needs. Our action in the market should makeit clear,'' an unnamed Fed official told the Post. Liquidity refersto the ready availability of cash.   The Fed's promise is aimed at preventing a repeat of the WallStreet situation two years ago, when the market fell 508 points ina single day.   On the day before that fall, the stock index had fallen 108points, leading mutual fund shareholders to cash in their shares.As the mutual funds ran low, they had to sell more shares to raisemoney, which in turn caused stock prices to drop even lower.   ``To calm the markets it's important that institutions knowthere are adequate funds available,'' the official told the Times.``Once the markets realize there will be no credit crunch, we canresume normal business.''   According to the unnamed official quoted by the Times, the Fed'sdecision was taken at a meeting late Friday and was beingcommunicated to officials in Asia and Western Europe this weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
