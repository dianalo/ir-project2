It is estimated that by the year 2000 about 4to 7% of primary energy comsumption could be covered by regenerativeenergy sources. The energy economy regards State help as necessary forusing these renewable energy sources. Varying energy supplies from windenergy converters could be accommodated on the grid without any problems.The monopoly of energy supplies tied to transmission lines is regardedas an obstacle in this context. There is reference to relevant wind energyconverter-network plans. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
