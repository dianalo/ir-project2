(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Joe Wedge only makes $4 an hour, but thebenefits are good. He gets a house, free heat, electricity, beef andall the milk his family can drink.   His employers say it's the least they can do to make sure hestays on the job.   Wedge is a farm laborer.   That makes him hot property in a part of the country where abooming economy and low unemployment have forced up wages andcreated a severe labor shortage for the dairy farmer. Some expertssay the labor crunch ranks second only to development pressures inpushing Northeast farmers out of business.   Those farmers who are staying in business are cutting backoperations, simplifying chores, turning to employment agencies orincreasing worker benefits, such as housing, health insurance,pension funds, paid vacation, holidays, livestock and even pizza.   ``One of the most important things is creating an environmentwhere people really have fun in the workplace,'' says Gary Maas, whoadvises farmers on labor problems and runs an agriculturalheadhunting service from his home in Massena, Iowa.   ``Every once in a while, do something wild. Bring in a pizza orsomething.''   Farm experts say the labor problem has become acute in the lastfew years, due to a dwindling pool of workers in the 16 to 24 agegroup and the bustling Northeast economy. This fall, Vermont'sunemployment rate dropped to 1.9 percent, setting a nationwide low.   Apple orchardists overcome the problem by hiring migrantlaborers. But dairy farms are year-round businesses, and it's hardto keep workers when the competition is a construction firm or aBurger King.   Maas, who was in New England recently conducting seminars on farmlabor management, took note of competing fast-food wages. ``I thinkin Manchester (N.H.) I saw they were paying $6.79 an hour,'' he said.   Wedge works for Tom and Mike Audet, brothers who have worked morethan 15 years on their 250-head dairy farm two miles from the NewYork state line.   ``The first eight years, we tried to do it by ourselves with ahigh school kid,'' Tom says in the barn's maternity ward, where apregnant Holstein is about to calve.   But the pool of high school students dwindled and the farmexpanded to 1,000 acres, 250 cows and 3,300 maple sugar taps. Overthe next six years, the Audets hired and lost 11 full-time workers.   They added a house this year after their 11th worker showed upone day in damp clothing. His tent had blown down in an ice storm.   ``The house payment is $225 a month for 30 years,'' Tom says ashe keeps an eye on the pregnant cow. ``So we can afford to pay afull-time man and not pay a lot of interest on the money weborrowed.''   ``We decided if we're going to hire someone, let's give them abreak and let them walk to work,'' Mike says.   Wedge, a thin man with glasses, red hair and a beard, says thehouse was a major reason he came to work on the Audets' farm 3{months ago. He'd been working in construction.   ``I get to play with the tractors,'' the 28-year-old Wedge sayswith a smile. ``I like machinery and cows. We get a house provided,lights, heat, all the milk you can drink. They give so much beef ayear. The hours are shorter than any other farm I've worked on.''   But while the Audets are ahead in the benefits game, many farmershave a ways to go to learn it, says Tom Maloney, an agriculturalextension associate at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Herecently conducted a survey of 122 New York dairy farms and foundmost employers were not keeping pace with health, retirement andother benefits such as sick days and paid holidays.   ``We found out of 88 employees, for example, that on average theyreceived two paid vacation days per year, and the average work weekwas 60 hours,'' Maloney says.   The Audets and others point out that extra benefits will onlyhelp if farmers can still find workers.   ``I think we may have to be looking at Mexicans, Jamaicans,''Mike says. ``Maybe these are the things we have to be thinking ofbecause the labor just isn't here.''   ``Part of it is the image of agricultural jobs, which is longhours, hard work and low pay, and I don't think we've done nearlyenough in emphasizing some of the positive aspects of farm work,''Maloney says. ``However, if you don't fix some of those things likethe low pay issue, you don't really stand a chance of turning theimage around.''   Wedge drives a tractor down the Audets' road as the brothersstand on a hillside gazing at the land between their home and LakeChamplain. Acres of golden hayfields lie beneath the slate-blue sky,separated only by stands of trees, an occasional fence, or a barnand silos.   Tom points to one of four farms the eye can see. It's up fordevelopment, and the one just beyond it has already been sold andsplit into 10-acre strips.   The brothers depart for lunch, while Wedge returns to thecowbarn. He opens a door and the milkers stream inside and head fortheir respective stalls.   ``Time flies on a farm. That's another good thing about it,''Wedge says. ``And I like to be with the animals.   ``I've tried other jobs and I always go back to farming becauseit keeps you healthy.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Dec. 28</NOTE></DOC>
