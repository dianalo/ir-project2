Many law firms, which experienced dizzying levels ofprofitability in the 1980s, had budgeted for lower bottomlines this year. But just how bad 1991 will turn out to bedepends heavily on collections during December, when lawfirms traditionally take in a disproportionate percentage oftheir revenue.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Too many firms still are relying on year-end collectionpushes in a recession when such an approach is not likely tosucceed,&quot; said Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a Sommerville, N.J.,legal consultant. &quot;Today, so many clients just don't have thecash around to make those payments on such a prompt basis. Ithink there will be some disappointed firms.&quot;   Like many other businesses, law firms -- all of which areprivately held -- have been plagued recently by late paymentsfrom customers. Mr. Hildebrandt said that traditionally, lawfirms assumed that there would be a gap of about four to fivemonths between their performance of legal work and theirreceiving payment for it. &quot;In most large law firms now it'sapproaching six months,&quot; he said.   Ronald S. Beard, managing partner of Gibson, Dunn andamp;Crutcher, one of Los Angeles's largest law firms, said thathis firm is projecting a decrease in profit of 10% to 15%from 1990 figures. &quot;Indeed we'll be quite pleased if we dothat,&quot; said Mr. Beard. The firm so far is about on target, hesays, but &quot;there's no way to know until you count the lastchecks that come in on the 31st of December.&quot;   Mr. Beard said that his law firm's billable hours areactually a little higher than expected. However, realizationrates -- the amount actually collected compared with hoursworked -- are down, he said. He attributed that, in part, tothe increased cost-consciousness of clients. &quot;You're beingforced to write off the time of some younger lawyers,&quot; hesaid. &quot;There are some clients that are demanding fee deals.&quot;   Henry L. King, managing partner of Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell,a New York law firm, said he expects 1991 to be &quot;a littleworse than last year.&quot; But, he cautions, &quot;How we end up thisyear depends very much on some very heavy bills that areoutstanding.&quot; Slow-paying clients, Mr. King notes, are &quot;doingtheir own cash management. These are not clients who aretroubled, these are clients that are working their own cash,&quot;he said.   Mr. King said that for the last five months his firm hasbeen busier than it was during the same months in 1990. Thefirm's bankruptcy, litigation and underwriting practices areparticularly strong, he said. Nevertheless, bills for much ofthis work won't be collected until next year.   Many firms that do not fare well in December will feel therepercussions when they try to negotiate with their lendersnext year. Ward Bower, a consultant with the Newtown Square,Pa., legal consulting firm Altman Weil Pensa, says that manylaw firms have been leaning more heavily than usual onrevolving lines of credit. Such loans frequently require thatlaw firms refrain from dipping into those credit lines for atleast 30 days during a year. Mr. Bower said that since manyfirms have had difficulty this year staying out of theirrevolving credit lines, he sees some firms &quot;relying on a bigbulge of fees in December in order to do that.&quot;   In addition, many law firms, which pay out big partnershipdraws in January, depend on bank loans in the beginning ofthe year to pay expenses. Mr. Bower says he expects banks to&quot;apply a lot more scrutiny to law firm lending. . . . {Theyare} requiring firms to come in with long-term economicprojections and business plans which in the past they didn'tdo.&quot;   Although Mr. Hildebrandt thinks that 1992 may be a littlebit better for law firms, Mr. Bower predicts continued roughtimes ahead. He says law firms will continue to reduce theirsize and even shed branch offices.   &quot;I think the shakeout's not over. It's not over by anymeans,&quot; he said.   ---   LAW FIRM MUST turn over case file of former client to RTC,court rules.   The federal appeals court in New York ruled that theResolution Trust Corp.'s demand for the file of a failedsavings and loan supersedes the usual right of a law firm tokeep a client's files as security against unpaid legal bills.   The case involved a New York law firm that refused to turnover files of a former Sandamp;L client to a new law firm appointedby the RTC to represent the client, Central Federal SavingsBank. The bank's former law firm, Berger, Steingut, Tarnoff andamp;Stern, argued that it had an &quot;attorney's lien&quot; on the files-- meaning the firm could keep the files until it was paid$300,000 in legal fees owed by the savings bank.   But a three-judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in New York disagreed. In affirming a lowercourt's decision, the appeals court judges found that the&quot;natural operation&quot; of the federal statute setting up the RTCas the agency responsible for bailing out failed thrifts&quot;supersedes an otherwise valid retaining lien.&quot;   &quot;General bankruptcy principles are often inapposite innational bank receiverships because the latter presentspecial challenges and circumstances,&quot; the court wrote.   Harvey Weinig, a partner at Berger Steingut, said the&quot;unequivocal language&quot; of the decision left open thepossibility that other types of liens might also be affectedby the RTC law.   ---   NOTED: A state appeals court in Los Angeles ruledWednesday that the religious rights of a landlord couplewould be violated if they were forced by fair housing laws torent an apartment to an unmarried man and woman, theAssociated Press reported. While the court found thatlandlords John and Agnes Donahue had violated statediscrimination laws by refusing the rental, the court saidthe Donahues, who described themselves as devout Catholics,were entitled to an exemption because of their &quot;sincerelyheld religious belief that fornication and its facilitationare sins.&quot; Deputy State Attorney General Kathleen Mikkelsonsaid the state likely would appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
