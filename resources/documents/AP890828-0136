Gorbachev has told officialsof the Lithuanian Communist Party that the Baltic republic has gonetoo far in its drive for independence, an activist said Monday.   Also on Monday, the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravdaaccused the People's Front of Moldavia _ comprised of ethnicactivists in the southern republic of Moldavia _ of trying to ``takepower on the crest of a muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism.''   In Vilnius, Lithuania, Romaldus Olozus, a member of the governingcouncil, or Sejm, of the Sajudis grassroots movement, said he andfour colleagues met with Lithuanian Communist Party chief AlgirdasBrazauskas on Monday after Gorbachev called the Lithuanian partyleader on Friday and Sunday to express his concern.   Brazauskas told the Sajudis members ``Gorbachev is concernedabout what's happening in Lithuania _ that what had happened so farwas worth supporting, but that now we'd gone too far,'' Olozus saidby telephone.   On Saturday, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee inMoscow issued a stinging statement saying separatists were leadingthe Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into an abyss.The statement came days after more than 1 million Baltic peoplejoined hands in a human chain to protest the 1939 agreement betweenJosef Stalin and Adolf Hitler that assigned the then-independentBaltics to a Soviet sphere of influence.   The government of Lithuania and the Communist Party of a secondBaltic republic, Latvia, came into line Monday behind the partystatement.   The Tass news agency said the Latvian party issued a statementcalling the party's stance ``the basis for concrete action fornormalizing the social-political situation in the country.''   In Lithuania, the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Sovietlegislature rejected a commission's findings that the inorporationof Lithuania into the Soviet Union by Stalin in 1940 was an``international crime.''   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said the findings didnot take into account Lithuania's political situation in 1939-40,and would ``lead the republic into a political dead end and servepoorly in the transfer to economic independence.''   It turned the Supreme Soviet commission's work back to it until anational panel finishes its review, Izvestia said.   Olozus said Gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings ofthe Lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legalargument for full independence.   A meeting of Communist Party activists was called Monday inVilnius, but nothing was known of its results.   The confrontation with the Kremlin was ``inescapable,'' but theresistance might slow down the Sajudis-led drive for greaterautonomy, if not outright independence from Moscow, Olozus said.   The grassroots movement will continue on the same path, ``but thesteps can be slower or faster, depending on the concretesituation,'' he said.   Sajudis Chairman Vytautus Landsbergis also indicated Sunday theKremlin statement ``will make some problems for us.'' But he addedhe didn't expect the Kremlin to crush the movement. ``I don't thinkthey're madmen,'' he said.   Olozus said no special meeting of Sajudis was planned to discussthe Kremlin reaction, but that Landsbergis would speak on LithuanianTV Tuesday night.   He said he had an impression from talking to Brazauskas thatGorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the CentralCommittee statement, but that ``his reaction was one ofdisappointment.''   In Moldavia, representatives of the Moldavian People's Front metleaders of a council representing non-Moldavian workers who havebeen on strike since last week to protest a draft law makingMoldavian the republic's official language, Tass reported. It didnot report any progress in their dispute over the language law.   The republic's Supreme Soviet is to take up the issue at ameeting Tuesday in the capital of Kishinev. On Sunday, thousandsrallied there to protest or support the law.   Russians, Ukrainians and other minorities who together make up 36percent of Moldavia's 4.2 million people are concerned the law willbe the first step toward a policy of discriminating againstnon-Moldavians.   Pravda on Monday said that the crowd drawn to Kishinev's LeninSquare on Sunday by the People's Front had ``submitted to long-termbrainwashing by nationalist-minded ideologists.''   ``Those who have led the Moldavian population to ethnic strife,exploiting perestroika slogans as a cover-up, are pursuing theirpersonal aims and seek to take power on the crest of a muddy wave ofchauvinism and separatism,'' it said.   It said the strikers, who have walked off the job at more than100 factories and offices, were particularly upset with a provisionof the law that would make Moldavian not only the governmentlanguage, but the language of ``inter-ethnic communications.''   The strikers say that will force even predominantly non-Moldaviancities to use Moldavian as the language of communications betweendifferent ethnic groups.</TEXT></DOC>
