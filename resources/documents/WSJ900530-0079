In the decision against Refac International Ltd. -- whosemain business is buying up broad patents and then suing othercompanies for alleged infringements -- U.S. District JudgeMichael Mukasey said such arrangements amount to &quot;nothing buta hunting license.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The case involved a software patent that Refac claimed wasbeing infringed by six major software companies: LotusDevelopment Corp., Ashton-Tate Inc., Borland InternationalInc., Computer Associates International Inc., Microsoft Corp.and Informix Software Inc. The suit, filed in 1989, is one ofthe first patent-infringement cases involving computersoftware.   The judge said Refac's contract with the Canadian patentholders, who sold Refac a 5% stake in the patent, violatedNew York's so-called champerty statute. Champerty, which isillegal in many, but not all, states, occurs when someonehelps pay the costs of someone else's lawsuit in exchange fora share of any proceeds.   Judge Mukasey, in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., saidthe real plaintiff in the case is Forward Reference SystemsLtd., the Canadian firm that owns 95% of the patent. Thejudge said the case will be dismissed unless ForwardReference either joins or replaces Refac in the suit.   &quot;The primary purpose for the assignment here was to enableRefac to commence actions as {Forward Reference's} surrogateplaintiff,&quot; the judge ruled.   Lawyers for the software companies praised the decision,which also said their clients could seek to require Refac topay their legal costs.   Henry B. Gutman, a lawyer for Lotus, said the decisioncould have implications for other companies that have beentargeted by New York-based Refac for alleged patentinfringement. &quot;If someone wants to bring a patentinfringement case, they have to bring a patent infringementcase. They can't bring in a hired gun like Refac,&quot; Mr. Gutmansaid.   Attorneys for Refac couldn't be reached for comment.Forward Reference also couldn't be reached.   The software involved was designed to improve the waycomputer instructions are given when a spreadsheet isprocessed. The patent was issued in 1983 to Remy Landau andRene Pardo, two Canadian inventors, who formed ForwardReference.   Frustrated in their efforts to get the software companiesto license the patent -- which the Refac lawsuit claims thecompanies were already using -- the inventors turned to Refacin 1989. In granting Refac the 5% stake, the company wasrequired to sue at least two alleged patent infringers withinone month.   Judge Mukasey said, &quot;The agreement acknowledges thatRefac's 5% interest is `to facilitate suit in Refac's name asplaintiff and to avoid the need for having {ForwardReference} named or brought into the suit as a co-plaintiff.'It is clear that Refac is not the real party in interest.&quot;   ---   HOSPITALS WIN Medicare payment dispute with federal healthagency.   A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that anestimated 6,000 hospitals don't have to comply with aDepartment of Health and Human Services regulation that, ineffect, required them to accept partial payment for Medicarepatients.   The HHS rule required payments to hospitals be limited tothe amount specified by Medicare, even if the patientreceived additional liability-award payments or was entitledto them under a liability-insurance policy. The hospitalssought the right to dip into such liability awards to helpcover actual costs. The hospitals estimated that Medicarepays 23% to 50% less than their charge.   Judge Royce Lambeth ruled last week that the federalgovernment couldn't interfere with hospitals' statutory rightto bill liability insurers or file liens against liabilityawards to collect their full charges for treatment ofMedicare payments.   &quot;This ruling will allow hospitals to collect millions ofdollars that otherwise would have been lost,&quot; said Gregory M.Luce, a partner at Fulbright andamp; Jaworski, the law firm thatrepresented the American Hospital Association, which broughtthe suit.   Health and Human Services attorney Darrel Ginstead said itwas the department's position that patients benefited from asystem that shielded their liability awards from thehospitals' grasp. He said the department hasn't decidedwhether to appeal the ruling.   ---   &quot;WORKING POOR&quot; are targeted by law firm for pro-bonoefforts.   Hunton andamp; Williams of Richmond, Va., the Southeast'slargest law firm, is opening a neighborhood office to providelegal services to residents who have jobs but can't affordlawyers.   The office, which will be headed by a full-time partnerand 11 part-time associates, will serve those who earn abovethe threshold for federal poverty benefits, includinglegal-aid services, but who make under twice that amount.(The threshold is $8,600 for an individual and goes upincrementally according to the number of dependents in thefamily.)   &quot;It's intended to reach the working poor, people who havejobs and a paycheck but don't have enough money in theirsavings to pay for a lawyer,&quot; said George H. Hettrick, thepartner who conceived of the idea.   Several large law firms have opened satellite offices inpoor neighborhoods and offer legal services for free. Butthis is one of the first attempts to meet the needs of peoplewho, while poor, have enough income to disqualify them fromfederally assisted legal aid.   Clients will be asked to pay a flat $50 fee, plus suchroutine costs as filing fees. Initially, the office will onlyrepresent clients in housing and real-estate matters, such aslandlord-tenant disputes, uncontested domestic matters andguardianship questions involving juveniles and the elderly,said Lewis F. Powell III, a partner and chairman of thefirm's pro-bono committee.   Hutton andamp; Williams ruled out taking on criminal-defensecases because the firm doesn't specialize in criminal-defensework, said Mr. Powell. Since Hunton andamp; Williams representsmany of Richmond's major employers, the firm will beprecluded from handling employment-discrimination cases, aswell.   Mr. Hettrick, who specializes in corporate finance, willstaff the office. Eleven associates volunteered to donate 100hours a year, said Mr. Powell. The office is expected to opennext month.   ---   Milo Geyelin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
