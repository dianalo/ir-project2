(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Turnkey Multimedia From IBM Brace yourself.andP;  The hot topic of the year ismultimedia, and just as with the other trendy technologies of recent years,you may find it hard to separate hype from hard fact.andM;Merely identifying the components of a multimedia system--and subsequentlyfiguring out how to string the components together--has, until now, been aSisyphean task.andP;  A task best left to dedicated production studios or highlymotivated tinkerers.andM;Enter IBM's Audio Visual Connection (AVC), perhaps the most visible andexciting product in this fledgling multimedia category.andP;  AVC gives you thetools to combine brilliant color, animated images, lifelike video pictures,and synchronized voice and music soundtracks into a unified presentation.andO;AVC is not the first multimedia product, nor the only one, but it's the firstto offer a turnkey solution for producing and replaying multimediapresentations on the IBM PC.andM;IBM will face some stiff competition in the very near future.andP;  The hottestnew technology is Intel's DVI (Digital Video Interactive).andP;  This technologycompresses video images and, in its latest version, can produce animatedscenes at 30 frames per second.andP;  DVI makes lifelike video recordingspossible.andM;New programs such as Authology: MultiMedia from CEIT Systems make DVIavailable to end users.andP;  Other non-DVI-based PC packages that mix recordedsound, video, and animated graphics include Prometheus from Software ClearingHouse and Animax from VisionBase.andP;  On the Macintosh, MacroMind'smuch-acclaimed Director offers many of the same multimedia features as IBM'sAVC, but since the Macintosh is better equipped for producing sound and usinga graphical user interface, the product design is substantially different.andO;Rumors indicate that MacroMind is looking for ways to bring its multimediamagic to the PC environment.andM;In the PC world, the AVC has set the standard, at least for the moment.andP;  Wegave the product a quick review in a First Looks article (PC Magazine,January 16, 1990, page 33) but its tight integration of so many elementsdeserves a closer look.andP;  What does AVC do?andP;  How well does it perform?andP;  Howexperienced do you have to be to do anything with it?andP;  And how do the myriadcomponents work, separately and together?andM;To find out, we loaded up an IBM PS/2 Model 70-A21 (a 25-MHz 386) with 5MB ofRAM and a 60MB hard disk, and we went to work.andM;A NATURAL EVOLUTIONandM;The history of business presentations is a history of one-upmanship.andP;  The AVCis a logical step beyond the simple slide-show software of yore.andP;  In one ofits earliest incarnations, desktop presentation software let you create anddisplay a series of computer-generated images.andP;  Subsequent generations addedfancy dissolves and transitional effects between static images.andP;  Mostrecently, programs such as Grasp from Paul Mace Software and Animator fromAutodesk have made it possible to animate text and objects on the screen.andM;The Audio Visual Connection takes all of this a step further.andP;  While it'sdifficult to find two people in agreement on the meaning of multimedia, mostwill agree that the term covers microcomputer systems that allow you tocreate and control presentations including graphics, video images, anddigitized sound.andP;  IBM's AVC does all this and more.andM;It gives you control over the way images appear and disappear from thescreen.andP;  It allows you to capture and manipulate images from video sourcesand to incorporate sound from live or recorded sources.andP;  Unlike the linearpresentation of images in a screenshow, AVC presentations can acceptinteractive responses from the viewer, branching to different segments asdesired.andP;  But the most important feature of the system is that it lets youcombine all of these elements into a synchronized whole.andM;THE SUM OF THE PARTSandM;The Audio Visual Connection is primarily a software program, which can beused in conjunction with a set of optional expansion boards for your MicroChannel or AT-bus computer.andP;  The program is comprised of five basic modules:graphics and text editing, sound capture and editing, video-image capture andediting, show scripting, and a file management system.andP;  All of thesecomponents use a similar table-editor interface, with plentiful pop-upprompts and option boxes to help you.andP;  There is also a standalone runtimemodule that lets you view or distribute presentations without having the fullAVC package installed.andM;The file management module is the hub of the program--and the first level youencounter.andP;  Here, the AVC uses a hierarchical structure to organize thenumerous files that compose a presentation.andP;  The topmost layer is theLibrary, and it contains Applications and a System Profile.andP;  Applications arecollections of files; each Application represents a single &quot;show.&quot;andP;  TheSystem Profile stores default settings for a presentation.andP;  You may havemultiple Libraries on a disk, and it is possible for an Application to sharecomponent files with other Applications.andM;The most important files in an Application are Image, Audio, and Story files.andO;Each of these is created and edited in its respective AVC module.andP;  You selectthe file you wish to edit and then use a pull-down menu to invoke the editmodule.andP;  The Audio Visual Connection is smart enough to summon the applicableeditor based on the file type you have selected.andP;  The menus are fairlyconsistent between modules, and there are many combination-keystroke commandsthat bypass the menus.andM;BUILT-IN GRAPHICSandM;The Image editing module serves a variety of purposes including imagecreation, editing, and text insertion.andP;  Large portions of the Image editingmodule resemble any basic paint program.andP;  And while AVC's paintingcapabilities won't replace your favorite bitmapped paint program, it doeshave a couple of unique font and image-fill features you'll find quiteeffective.andM;The Image editing module provides an array of drawing primitives.andP;  There aretools for straight lines, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand lines, and toolsfor selecting line widths and colors.andP;  You can resize objects and fill solidobjects with colors or patterns.andP;  You can also perform some relativelysophisticated operations, such as outlining an irregularly shaped object witha color and then filling it, or using an object as a repeating fill pattern.andM;The Image editing module is also where you'll annotate (or enter text on)your graphics screens.andP;  As a matter of fact, you can bring video images intothis module and add text to them as well.andP;  You can choose from five differentfont outlines and define up to nine different fonts at once.andP;  Each font hasits own size, color, margins, spacing, and even shadowing as part of itsdefinition.andM;Text and images exist on separate planes, which makes it possible to edit thetext without obliterating the images behind it.andP;  The text looks especiallygood when compared with that of most business graphics programs because ituses anti-aliased fonts.andP;  These fonts use levels of shaded pixels that blendthe edges of the line or curve with the background, tricking the eye intobelieving that the image has no jagged edges.andM;VIDEO VISIONSandM;Fortunately, you don't need to hand-draw everything in your AVCpresentations.andP;  The system accepts digitized video images and imports imagesfrom other graphics formats.andP;  The import facility converts TIFF (Tagged ImageFile Format), TGA (Targa File Format), and IMDS (Image Data Stream--producedby IBM's ImagEdit, a gray scale image editor).andP;  These files are converted tothe AVC's native file format.andM;A built-in screen-capture program provides another alternative forincorporating images created elsewhere into the AVC environment.andP;  And you canalso capture video images, provided that you spring for the Video CaptureAdapter/A, a Micro Channel-only option with a list price of $2,250.andM;The Video Capture Adapter accepts signals from a wide range of video sources,including cameras, VCRs, and videodisks.andP;  It can use composite video (NTSC)signals, RGB, or S-video (a high-resolution format also known as Y/C).andP;  Oncethe signals are captured, AVC editing software lets you modify the image byadjusting color levels for both brightness and contrast.andP;  Finally, capturedand modified images can be digitized and stored on-disk.andP;  (Note that once youhave taken this step, you can no longer alter the image settings as you couldbefore you stored it.)andM;SOUNDS FOR THE DISCRIMINATING EARandM;Another all-important optional card that boosts the multimedia prowess of theAVC is the Audio Capture and Playback Adapter, which lists for $565 in eitherthe AT-bus or Micro Channel version.andM;This card has four 1/8-inch mini-plug jacks in the mounting bracket: a stereoline input, a mono microphone input, and two stereo output connectors--onefor headphones, and the other for line output.andM;For our tests, I used a standard component-stereo tape deck and a pair ofamplified speakers (the kind used with a Walkman or similar portable stereo).andO;The little speakers sounded deep and beautiful--a far cry from the tinnysound we've endured from our PCs.andM;The AVC is able to capture and store sound in three different resolutions:voice, music, and stereo.andP;  The stereo setting is superlative, but highfidelity has its tradeoffs: top-quality sound uses up disk space.andM;Voice-quality sound takes up 5.5K of disk space every second, which adds upto a megabyte in just over 3 minutes.andP;  The music-quality setting stores twiceas much data for each moment of sound; it fills a megabyte in just a minuteand a half.andP;  And since the stereo setting actually stores two music tracks,it uses twice as much space again; you will fill a megabyte in just 45seconds.andP;  Stereo sounds great but should be used judiciously.andM;The voice quality, described by IBM as near-AM quality, is the poorest of thelot.andP;  But it was at least as good as my car radio, not hard on the ear, andperfectly suitable for the speaking voice during a tutorial session.andP;  Themusic setting is described as above AM but below FM in quality.andP;  Like thevoice setting, the music setting combines the two tracks of a stereo signalinto mono, but the sound quality is definitely better.andP;  This setting workswell for most music.andP;  The stereo setting produces the same quality as themusic setting, but it keeps the two stereo signals intact and is best whenyou want to dazzle your audience.andM;Once the soundtrack is recorded, you can have a field day with the Sound editfeatures.andP;  I recorded about 20 seconds of instrumental music and then deletedextra measures to tailor the piece for my presentation.andP;  Next, using a seriesof interactive pop-up menus, I inserted some effects to control the volume ofcertain transition points.andM;This was a good start, but I needed a longer soundtrack.andP;  Using the wordprocessing--like editing commands, I was able to block portions of the pieceand copy them.andP;  Some of the joints between my blocks were a bit on the roughside, but since the AVC lets you work in either 1-second or 1/10-secondincrements, I was able to smooth them out.andM;Other sophisticated features hone your sounds.andP;  You can read in two separatesound files and synchronize them, then store them as a new, combined file.andO;You can also identify points in the soundtrack that you may later refer to inthe presentation script.andP;  Thus, visual effects can be synchronized with theaudio elements.andM;The AVC will never be mistaken for a full-featured digital sound-editingprogram.andP;  For example, you cannot change the pitch or pace of a recording.andO;But for adding sound to images, it is an excellent, imminently manageabletool.andM;ALL TOGETHER NOWandM;The Story editor is an interactive workspace that pulls the pieces of thepresentation together into a unified script.andP;  Using the same sort of&quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; table layout used in many of the other modules, thiseditor has columns to specify the filename, effects, timings, and on-screenlocations.andP;  For example, you can set a sound segment to start silently andfade in over a fixed period of time.andP;  Or you can specify the locations for aportion of an image to appear on the screen, replete with special effects,and define how it will appear.andM;A glance at an existing script can be daunting, to say the least (see thesidebar &quot;AVC a la Carte&quot;).andP;  The dozens of script lines with varied parametersseem overwhelming at first.andP;  But, more than any other module, the Storyeditor shows off AVC's native intelligence.andM;For example, if you were to start a line with the command PLAY SOUNDS1, thenmove to the Method column, you could call up a list of effects that includesFADEIN and FADEOUT.andP;  Subsequent columns let you interactively select thetarget volume level and the duration between sounds.andP;  Prompts appearthroughout the program to help you keep track of your options.andM;For images, you can choose from a series of 16 different effects, withdescriptive names such as WEAVE, CRUSH, DIAG, STRIPES, and EXPLODE.andP;  Again,you can specify the interval between effects.andP;  You can even call up a list ofsynch labels (the key points you defined in the audio module) so that animage makes its debut at the proper sound cue.andM;Best of all is the way the AVC handles portions of images.andP;  With just a fewmouse clicks, you can call up the source image, select a section of it, andthen place it on the target image.andP;  This allows for some quick, flexible workstrategies.andP;  For example, you never have to be careful about where you placeelements of an image in the Image edit module, since you'll always be able toadjust the placement in the script.andP;  You can also create a single image thatwill be laden with all the text you'll need, and then select portions asnecessary from within the Story editor.andM;PRO PRESENTATIONSandM;Those who are more ambitious will have plenty of room to grow with AVC'sAudio Visual Authoring language, known as AVA.andP;  This is a full-featuredprogramming language, complete with DO loops, conditional IF branching, andrecursive subroutine calls.andP;  There are also dozens of commands and functionsdesigned to handle audio, visual, and file-management operations.andM;AVA allows you to call subscripts in the middle of a script, concoctingcomplex &quot;shows within shows.&quot;andP;  A set of preprogrammed effects, such asCascade, Galaxy, Swirl, and Scissors, provide quickcanned animation.andP;  Sincethese effects are preprogrammed story scripts, you can edit themindividually, use them as a tutorial, and then create your own effects.andM;Still not enough?andP;  AVA includes facilities that allow you to manage hostcomputer connections, integrate C programs, and call on the specialcapabilities of OS/2.andP;  There is no shortage of building blocks here for thosewith the skill, aptitude, and patience to assemble them.andM;MULTI-SHORTCOMINGSandM;While AVC covers most of the multimedia basics, a number of features arelacking.andP;  There are only rudimentary provisions for animating graphicsobjects.andP;  You have access to a slew of transition effects, and you can createone sprite or element at a time that can be moved across the screen withoutaffecting the background, but there is no provision for serious tweeninganimation as is found in Autodesk's Animator.andP;  There's also no way to inputlive, moving video images from an external source, or to replay video imagesfrom the disk for a semblance of live video.andP;  AVC works best when it bringsin still video and graphics images and strings them together.andM;The quality of the displayed image also has its share of problems.andP;  AVC isdesigned to work in MCGA mode (320 by 200 resolution), which yields acoarse-looking image despite the 256 colors.andP;  The VGA mode is only slightlybetter.andP;  Here, the 640 by 480 resolution is an improvement, but the 16-colorlimitation is terribly depressing.andP;  The best image display available is viathe 8514/A, in a 640 by 480 display with 256 colors.andP;  Still, you can't helpbut wish that AVC would take advantage of the 8514/A's higher 1,024 by 768resolution with 256 colors and provide really stunning images.andM;Another small glitch was that our test system, complete with the 8514/Aadapter and monitor, produced on-screen snow when loading images during theplayback of a show.andP;  This is something I have hardly seen since the days ofCGA.andP;  According to an IBM representative, this results from noise generatedby the operating system.andM;Assembling a collection of images with mixed color palettes poses problems aswell.andP;  If you take two images that were created with different palettes andplace a portion of one on the screen while a piece of the other is alreadydisplayed, you will find that the colors of the first image may change tobizarre and unpredictable combinations.andM;But the AVC's error messages were the greatest source of frustration.andP;  Whentrying to draw a new graphic, I received an &quot;Out of memory&quot; error.andP;  I knewthe program was resource-hungry, but on a machine with 5MB of installed RAMthis error seemed extreme.andP;  Then the audio recording module bombed out after20 seconds of recording.andP;  The message informed me that the hard disk waseither too slow or too fragmented to keep up with the recording.andP;  I also gota few other strange error messages, too cryptic to interpret.andP;  I discoveredthat many of these messages are not explained in the manuals.andP;  There areerror messages listed for the runtime and installation programs, but none forthe main AVC program.andM;To compound the problem, the error messages I received had nothing to do withthe cause of the difficulty: I had filled the hard disk almost to capacity.andO;(This was quite a feat inasmuch as AVC was the only application installed ona 60MB hard disk.)andP;  Once I deleted some extraneous directories, the errorsdisappeared, but I learned that it's best to consider installing a large harddisk if you're going to create any sizable presentation.andP;  And don't put toomuch stock in the program's error messages, either.andM;It's not just the error messages; the entire reference document is ratherscant and does not measure up to typical IBM standards.andP;  The content isgenerally presented using a quasi-tutorial approach, and it does not comeclose to an exhaustive treatment of material.andP;  This may work as a strategy toavoid intimidating potential users, but it makes for a lousy reference tool.andM;Perhaps AVC's designers intended to have the on-line help system take theplace of a document.andP;  This help system, written using the AVC system itself,is a hypertext/graphics tour de force.andP;  There are icons of books with tabbeddividers (these represent the on-screen index), plus buttons and prompts thatlead to a myriad of highly designed explanations and examples.andP;  Many subjectseven include accompanying audio tracks.andP;  It's a comprehensive but cumbersomesystem.andP;  It seems to take an eternity to load the correct help topic, even ona 25-MHz 386 computer!andP;  Call me old-fashioned, call me a spoilsport, but giveme some well-designed reference screens and a thick manual with a longtutorial to make me a happier fellow.andM;THE BIG PICTUREandM;The Audio Visual Connection is ambitious and impressive, and it has systemrequirements to match.andP;  To create your own stories using the AVC, you need a286 machine with OS/2 1.1 or later and 4MB of memory.andP;  If you have a 386, youcan use the same OS/2 requirements or else run AVC under DOS 4.0 or laterwith 640K and an additional 4MB of expanded memory.andP;  Both configurationsrequire a minimum of 30MB storage space, but our experience indicates thatyou can easily use three to five times that amount--especially if you intendto run any other applications on the machine.andM;To show your presentations, the memory requirements drop to 2MB (2MB ofexpanded memory with the DOS 4.0 configuration) and a 20MB hard disk.andP;  Youalso need a supported VGA or 8514/A-compatible monitor.andM;While no single module is truly extraordinary, AVC's tight integration ofvideo-capture, image-edit, sound-recording, and story-scripting componentsearn it ground-breaking status.andP;  The programmability and access to all sortsof third-party options make the AVC all the more powerful (see the sidebar&quot;The Making of a Presentation&quot;).andM;IBM recently announced its M-Motion Video Adapter/A board for the MicroChannel, a full-motion video board that supports live video from externalsources such as VCRs, video disks, and cameras.andP;  IBM plans to incorporatesupport for this board in future versions of the AVC, but for the moment theboard is a standalone product with its own software.andP;  The introduction of amotion video product is another indication of IBM's determination to beat thecompetition with a full suite of multimedia products.andM;Remember that AVC is the first of many multimedia products.andP;  PC Magazine willbe taking its first in-depth look at this burgeoning scene in an upcomingissue.andP;  For now, IBM's Audio Visual Connection has an early lead on a pack ofcompetitors who are just beginning to gear up for the race.andP;  But thisbusiness has proven that there are no prizes just for being first.andM;Alfred Poor is a contributing editor of PC Magazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
