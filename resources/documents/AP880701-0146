The last thing he wants to be is the vice presidentialnominee on a losing ticket,'' said Young.   The mayor, in Cincinnati to speak at a black achievers banquet,said having Sen. John Glenn of Ohio on the ticket would be an assetfor the Democrats.   ``I think very highly of John Glenn,'' Young said. ``He has alot of credibility on issues such as defense, and would beextraordinarily valuable to the ticket.''   Young, an early associate of the late civil rights leader MartinLuther King Jr., was ambassador to the United Nations during theCarter administration. He is in his second term as mayor of Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
