(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Because she lives in one of themost remote places in the Soviet Union, Galya Chinchikova makesabout triple the national average wage, but it doesn't translateinto a life of luxury.   ``We have plenty of money, but we have nothing,'' said the34-year-old Communist Party worker in Yuzhno Kurilsk, a fishing townof 7,000 people on Kunashir, southernmost of the disputed KurilIslands.   The lack of comfort didn't make Mrs. Chinchikova any less loyal,however. It's simply the way pioneering life is on the cold andrainy island where the sun shines only 50 or 60 days a year.   Her husband, Vassily Chinchikov, 37, is an exuberant artist whoseseascape murals decorate the walls of the town canteen. He sellspaintings to supplement his wife's 600-ruble ($925) monthly income.   The couple, both born on Kunashir, invited a foreign visitor tostay the night in their warm and brightly furnished but tinyapartment. They slept behind a curtain in an alcove off the livingroom. Their 7-year-old son, Andrei, had a bunk bed over a workshoptable in a small room off the kitchen. The plumbing was primitive,but it was indoors.   The family is among the better-housed on the island.   The poorer housing is low, tarpaper-covered, wooden huts whoseresidents draw water from wells or standpipes. Outdoor privy toiletsare common. Few streets are paved in the hilly town.   Chinchikov said he loved the wildness of the volcanic island,which has such abundant nature that visitors may be served bear stewand home-smoked salmon.   But as an artist, he said, ``the main problem is the lack ofcontact with the rest of the world.''   That may change now that the Soviet government wants foreigntourists to come to the formerly off-limits region.   Living standards will change by the end of the century,Vyacheslav Gudakov, deputy chairman of the town government, said ashe conducted a tour featuring an almost-completed new hospital.   Streets will be paved, he said, and comfortable apartments willbe built, as well as a new school, culture center and departmentstore.   The rich fishery of Kunashir and nearby Shikotan Island earns 70million rubles ($108 million) a year for the central government,while Moscow sends back only half that money, Gudakov said.   ``Now we have a very funny system,'' the Soviet interpreterinterjected wryly.   Gudakov said new regulations soon will let the local governmentdecide how to use most of its revenues.   Asked if Moscow had neglected the island outpost 5,000 miles fromthe capital, Gudakov replied, ``It was the same in all the country.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Sept. 17</NOTE></DOC>
