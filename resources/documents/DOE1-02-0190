The unit, located in The Geysers area of Northern California,has a design rating of 72.3 MW(e) gross at 1.5 in HgA. The selectionof equipment and design of systems was greatly affected by the steamsales agreement. Purchase of steam on a per pound basis dictated thatthe plant be designed with the most efficient cycle possible. Likewise,the equipment was specified to insure maximum steam utilization. TheTest and Start-up Program documentation was created to ensure that allequipment and systems met the engineering specifications, proved operational,and were satisfactory for commercial operation. This paper reviews thefirst year of unit operations, comparing system and unit design and predictedperformance with actual performance. The unit's high availability andcapacity factors are evidence that the decisions for designing a highefficiency unit and invoking a rigorous Test and Start-up Program arejustified. 4 references, 4 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
