During a political career spanning more than four decades, the 73-year-old Mr. Strauss achieved a larger-than-life stature and a mastery of political infighting of the sort that Americans might associate with the late mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley. He played a central role in reconstructing Germany after World War II. He was a member of the Bundestag, or parliament, when it was formed in 1949. He was a confidant of Konrad Adenauer and helped forge Germany's metamorphosis from defeated Reich to economic powerhouse. He was instrumental in creating Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium; developing closer ties between the East bloc and West Germany; and strengthening his nation's commitment to NATO and the U.S.    To his followers in Munich, Mr. Strauss, with his thick Bavarian accent, sharp tongue and stocky appearance, was the &quot;king of Bavaria.&quot; In Germany, his escapades -- from being booted as defense minister during a scandal in 1962 to his being robbed while cavorting with a New York City prostitute several years ago -- were legendary. Mr. Adenauer once said of the young Mr. Strauss: &quot;I wish he would be more discreet.&quot;    Even the circumstances of his death reinforced this image. Last Friday night he was out late attending a birthday celebration for a Bavarian industrialist. The next morning he went to an Oktoberfest celebration with German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz. Then, it was on to join the hunting party of Bavarian Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, one of the world's richest men and Germany's largest landowner.    Mr. Strauss collapsed during the hunting trip. He was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Regensburg where doctors, believing that a stomach ailment helped trigger his seizure, operated on him. Yesterday, Dr. Rolf Manz, head of the medical team, said Mr. Strauss had suffered a mild heart attack brought on by an undetermined internal disorder and had died of pulmonary complications.    Mr. Strauss's death will bring quick political repercussions. The energetic Mr. Strauss had a hand in just about everything on the German political scene. He attracted much investment to his home state of Bavaria. In industrial policy, Mr. Strauss was a strong supporter of state intervention and subsidies, particularly to the aerospace industry. In foreign policy, he represented an ideological counterweight to Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who often fought with Mr. Strauss over such issues as economic sanctions against South Africa.    Mr. Strauss, who never became chancellor, was a longtime adversary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Union. Mr. Strauss often sought to embarrass and undermine the chancellor by heightening tensions within the ruling government coalition, led by Mr. Genscher.    But Mr. Strauss also was an important ally for Mr. Kohl. In the longer term, his death could create problems for the chancellor as he struggles to retain power. Besides being governor of the state of Bavaria, Mr. Strauss was chairman since 1961 of the Christian Social Union. The CSU exists only in Bavaria, as the Bavarian sister party of the ruling CDU. And the CSU's healthy existence is directly tied to the health, and popularity, of Mr. Strauss.    &quot;Franz Josef Strauss is the CSU,&quot; said Meinhard Miegel, director of the Institute for Economic and Social Policy, a Bonn-based think tank. &quot;With him gone, the party is fatherless.&quot;    Although no one predicts the imminent demise of the CSU, the party's lock on the Bavarian electorate is certain to slip once a successor to Mr. Strauss is selected. Because of his popularity, Mr. Strauss delivered a majority of the voters in a very dependable, machine-like fashion, year after year. And his reputation as a tough right-winger kept the ultra right-wing, which is becoming more popular in Bavaria, from gaining even more support.    Mr. Strauss's deputy, Max Streibl, legally will assume leadership of the Bavarian state government. But Mr. Strauss never groomed a clear successor to the party chairmanship, associates say. As many as a half-dozen aides may lay claim to it.    Mr. Strauss often conflicted with the Bonn government. His ambition of becoming foreign minister was never realized. He held two other cabinet posts, as defense minister under Mr. Adenauer and as finance minister under Kurt Georg Kiesinger.    Still, Mr. Strauss conducted an alternative foreign policy from his Munich power base. His surprise visit to Moscow last December to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev created the greatest stir. Mr. Strauss upstaged Mr. Kohl, who will meet Mr. Gorbachev for the first time later this month. More importantly, the right-wing Mr. Strauss came back talking of a new era in Soviet-German relations.    Indeed, Mr. Strauss's legacy is a study in contrasts: an ardent anti-Communist who did much to further ties with the East; an ardent capitalist who did much to extend state intervention in the private sector. On his 70th birthday, the influential weekly Die Zeit said that Germany itself had a &quot;schizophrenic relationship&quot; with Mr. Strauss. For some, he was &quot;a bull in a china shop.&quot; For others, he was a visionary with a keen political instinct.    ---   Dirk Johnson contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
