The pulmonary consequencesof repeated or prolonged low level NO{sub 2} exposure, as experiencedby persons utilizing gas stoves for cooking or non-vented kerosene spaceheaters, are unknown. Fourteen healthy, young adult males were studiedin a double blind prospective experiment to determine whether differencesin urinary hydroxyproline excretion were associated with experimentalexposure to 0.6 ppm NO{sub 2} for four hours a day on three consecutivedays. Changes in the urinary hydroxyproline:creatinine ratio were monitoredin relation to exposure to both NO{sub 2} and air in all subjects. Noevidence of increased hydroxyproline excretion related to NO{sub 2} exposurewas found (p = 0.92).</TEXT></DOC>
