The rule was first proposed in 1989 by the FASB, the chiefrule-making body for accountants, and will be effective forcalendar 1992 financial reports.</LP><TEXT>   The board had been expected to issue the rule despite theopposition, although its final form had been unclear. Underone modification adopted in October, companies with less than$150 million in assets get an added three years and mustcomply for calendar 1995 reports. This will delay thedisclosure rule for 82% of all banks.   The rule requires all companies, including banks, todisclose in footnotes to their financial statements the fairmarket value of all financial instruments held by them. Untilnow, companies only had to list the original, or book, valueof these assets.   Bankers oppose such disclosures as being costly,time-consuming and possibly confusing to investors. Many alsosee the new rule as just the first step toward actual changesin balance-sheet reporting.   &quot;It will be very difficult to set a fair value on manycommercial and industrial loans, which are often unique invalue and lending terms,&quot; said Donna Fisher, manager ofaccounting policy for the 9,000-member American BankersAssociation. She said loans comprise about 60% of the averagebank's assets, and that many of those are of the commercialor industrial type. &quot;That's why bankers are against suchdisclosures, &quot; she added.   Ms. Fisher said bankers asked the FASB to permit companiesto disclose these asset and liability values in unauditedsupplements to their audited annual financial statements forthree years before being required to include them in theaudited reports.   &quot;But we were turned down,&quot; she said. &quot;We could have usedthe extra time given smaller-asset companies because some ofthese disclosures are difficult and time-consuming todevelop.&quot;   Jeannot Blanchet, an FASB project manager, said permittingsuch disclosures in unaudited supplementary financial reportswould lessen their credibility. Mr. Blanchet also said thatthe Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped itsopposition to giving public banks with less than $150 millionin assets an added three years to make the footnotedisclosures.   The FASB has received 204 letters of comment, of which 75%opposed this rule, Mr. Blanchet said. &quot;Many of the lettersopposing it came from banks but some were from industrialcompanies and utilities, which felt it was more relevant forbanks than for them,&quot; he said.   Mr. Blanchet said the FASB favors such disclosures inorder to provide investors and creditors with more relevantvalues of assets and liabilities &quot;in order to assess futurecash flows.&quot; These disclosures are particularly relevant intough economic times when financial institutions areencountering severe problems, he added.   Bankers noted that legislation passed by Congress andawaiting President Bush's signature would require bankregulators to develop their own current-value disclosures ofassets and liabilities for all financial institutions withina year. But such disclosures may differ with those requiredunder the new FASB rule, Ms. Fisher said.   In addition, the FASB plans to propose an accountingchange next year that would force some banks to create biggerreserves for troubled loans.</TEXT></DOC>
