The final terms provide stockholders with 25 cents less a share than the $4 the two companies announced when they reached a preliminary agreement last month.    The definitive pact also eliminates a provision in the earlier agreement that would have provided different terms for Martin Marietta Corp., the Bethesda, Md., concern that holds a 24% stake in financially troubled Equatorial.    Contel is an Atlanta-based telecommunications company; its ASC satellite communications unit is making the purchase.    Under the tentative pact announced in July, Martin Marietta was to receive $12.7 million in cash and $14.4 million in promissory notes for its stake. In exchange, it was to sign a three-year agreement not to compete, and a 10-year agreement to buy $45 million of services from Contel's ASC unit. The aerospace and defense contractor will now receive about an indicated $13.4 million for its holding.    An Equatorial official said the initial provision had been eliminated because &quot;there had been some concern&quot; on the part of the company's investment bankers, lawyers and certain shareholders over the separate transaction. Equatorial said the proposed transaction, which it expects to close by yearend, is subject to approval by its shareholders and federal regulators, as well as certain other conditions.    Equatorial's stock closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $3.125 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
