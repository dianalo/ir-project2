The deaths followed criticism of the army's tactic of allowingtroops to fire plastic bullets more freely at Arab stone throwers.A United Nations relief agency has protested what it said was asharp increase in injuries since the plastic bullets went into use.   Rabin said plastic bullets were added to the soldiers' arsenalin August after rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs ``proved to beinsufficient to cope'' with stone-throwing incidents linked to the9-month-old uprising in the occupied territories.   ``Those who participate in violent activities suffer morecasualties in terms of wounded,'' he told a news conference at amilitary camp in Beit El, 12 miles north of Jerusalem. ``It did notincrease the number of people who are killed.''   Rabin added: ``Our purpose is to increase the number (ofwounded) among those who take part in violent activities but not tokill them.''   Asked about the U.N. Relief and Works Agency protest, Rabin saidhis job was to reduce violence in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip. ``Other protests, with all due respect, are of secondaryimportance to me,'' Rabin said.   The first confirmed fatalities from plastic bullets wereidentified by hospital officials as Osama Braikah, 17, of KhanYunis refugee camp, and Jihad Zanoun, 27, of Gaza City. Both are inthe Gaza Strip.   Braikah was hit by two plastic bullets today during ademonstration by dozens of stone-throwing protesters in his camp,said Dr. Ahmed Yazejeh of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. One bullethit his face, Yazejeh said, ``but a plastic bullet to the heartkilled him.''   Yazejeh said he received the information from physicians atNasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, where Braikah was declared dead onarrival. A spokesman at Nasser Hospital also confirmed the fatalitywas caused by a plastic bullet.   The other victim, Zanoun, died Monday after being struck in thechest by a plastic bullet during clashes in Gaza City, according todoctors at Shifa Hospital.   The deaths raised to 276 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died.   Violence in the occupied territories Monday left two otherPalestinians dead and 67 wounded. Today, at least 10 Palestinianswere wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank andGaza, eight with plastic bullets and two with live ammunition,hospital officials said.   Army spokesmen have contended plastic bullets, which penetratethe body with less force than live ammunition, are not lethalunless fired from less than 20 yards' distance.   Also today, Israeli warplanes attacked Shiite Moslem guerrillabases in south Lebanon. The army said at least two jet fighterstook part in the attack on bases belonging to Hezbollah, anIranian-backed Shiite faction.   There were no immediate reports on casualties.   The attacks near the Lebanese village of Al-Luwayzah appeared tobe a warning to Shiite extremists following the assassinations lastweek of three moderate Lebanese leaders.   An army spokesman said the target of today's air raid wasguerrilla headquarters for planning and executing attacks againstIsraeli forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen in Israel'sself-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.   It was the 15th air strike against guerrilla targets in Lebanonthis year.   Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in June 1985after a three-year occupation but maintains a six-to-10-mile widebuffer zone north of the Israeli border.</TEXT></DOC>
