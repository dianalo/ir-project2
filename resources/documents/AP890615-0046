The dollar closed at 151.30 yen, up 3.25 yen from Wednesday's148.05-yen close. It was the highest since Aug. 14, 1987, when thedollar closed at 152.40.   The dollar now has gained 10.65 yen since June 5, including a4.90-yen jump on Monday.   It opened today at 150.30 yen, its low for the day, and hit151.35 yen at one point.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 489.90 points, or 1.47percent, this year's largest one-day loss, and closed at 32,913.09.   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told reporters the dollar'ssurge resulted mainly from speculative buying by Japanese investors.He said it had nothing to do with fundamental elements in the U.S.and Japanese economies.   ``We must stop (the dollar's further rise) by using every meansavailable,'' Murayama said, expressing concern that the higherdollar could bring inflationary pressure in Japan.   ``We'll take resolute measures under the established system ofcooperation with other countries,'' he said.   But there is no immediate need to call a meeting of financechiefs of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries before thegroup's scheduled summit in Paris in mid-July, Murayama said.   The Bank of Japan reportedly continued to sell dollars in effortsto check the U.S. currency's rise, although the central bank doesnot comment on its monetary activities.   ``The BOJ intervention didn't work at all,'' said a Bank of Tokyoanalyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Everybody was justbuying as the dollar rose, trying to get on the bandwagon.''   Traders said, however, there was some dollar-selling to takeprofits.   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank said, ``No matter how often theJapanese side says the dollar should stay lower, it has smallinfluence because the United States ... doesn't make any moves.Japanese market players have taken this as an indication that theUnited States is allowing the dollar's surge for the moment.''   He said investors were aggressively buying dollars, anticipatingimproved U.S. trade figures for April, due to be announced latertoday in Washington.   On the stock exchange, Daiwa Securities dealer Kenji Ishizukasaid share prices were lower across the board, mainly because of thedollar's surge against the yen.   ``In addition to the major discouragement due to the yen'splunge, many Japanese investors avoided buying while awaitingrelease of the U.S. trade report later tonight,'' he said.   Ishizuka said a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit would promotea further rise by the dollar, which could further discourage stockinvestment.   Some investment trust companies intermittently bought cheaperissues for profit-taking, but it could not stop the index's fall, hesaid.   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 650million shares, up from 450 million the previous day.</TEXT></DOC>
