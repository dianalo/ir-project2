New York-based Viacom said in a statement that the directors group decided that the $3.1 billion offer from Arsenal Holdings Inc., a unit of National Amusements Inc., &quot;was not more favorable&quot; than the management group's offer, which is valued at about $3 billion. The National Amusements offer was scheduled to expire today.    &quot;Everybody expected this,&quot; said one Wall Street arbitrager. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Viacom shares closed at $44.625, up 12.5 cents.    The announcement leaves National Amusements, a theater chain operator, with several options, Wall Street sources said, including increasing its bid or launching a hostile takeover bid for Viacom. A National Amusements spokesman declined to comment on the company's plans.    As previously reported, National Amusements, based in Dedham, Mass., has been accumulating stock in Viacom since last October and currently holds a 19.6% stake. The National Amusements offer, valued at about $49.25 a share, consists of $37.50 a share in cash, a partial share of a new issue of preferred stock valued at $7.25 a share, and an equity stake in a new company formed by National Amusements valued at about $4.50 a share.    The Viacom management offer is valued by arbitragers at about $47 a share in cash, preferred stock and shares in a new company. Each transaction also includes assumption of debt.    The value of each offer, arbitragers note, hinges on assumptions about when each transaction might close. The Viacom management offer, which has been accepted by directors, is generally expected to close more quickly than a National Amusements bid, which means investors likely would get payment for their stock sooner.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
