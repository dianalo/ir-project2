Hagen's small but boistrous anti-tax Progress Party, once shunned as a right-wing fringe group, has been surging ever since oil prices plunged in 1986 and cut Norway's revenues by 10%.    Latest polls show that the party has the support of 22% of Norway's voters in a political arena traditionally dominated by the Labor Party and the Conservatives.    Norway's Storting, the parliament, where the Progress Party has only two of the 157 seats, appears headed for a &quot;political earthquake&quot; in next year's elections, said an article in the weekly Nytt Fra Norge.    Anti-tax forces also have gained ground in Denmark, another Scandinavian welfare state. Norway, however, had grown rich from its North Sea oil fields, and the 1986 oil-price collapse hit particularly hard.    The standard of living has dropped for the first time since World War II, triggering a wave of discontent and criticism of the established parties.    Mr. Hagen, 44 years old, wants to lower taxes, restrict immigration, cut down the public sector and let private companies handle traditional welfare-state tasks, such as hospital care, child nursing and old-age care.    In a country where big benefits, financed through taxes, were taken for granted even by conservatives, Mr. Hagen's policies were considered extreme.    But Conservative Party policies outlined earlier this month borrowed from some of Mr. Hagen's ideas, an apparent attempt to ride the trend in advance of the election scheduled for Sept. 11, 1989.    A strong advocate of a free-market economy, Mr. Hagen maintains the government's functions should be restricted to basics, such as defense and law and order.    Political analysts acknowledge that Mr. Hagen is charismatic but say he became so popular mainly because there isn't any non-socialist alternative to Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's ruling Labor Party.    Lars Hellberg, a political commentator at the leading conservative newspaper Aftenposten, said cooperation between the Conservatives, the farmer-dominated Center Party and Christian Democrats had &quot;completely crashed&quot; since conservative leader Kaare Willoch's three-party coalition resigned in 1986.    Mr. Hellberg said the consequent &quot;irritation, frustration and desperation&quot; benefited Mr. Hagen.    The Progress Party also is getting support for its attacks on Norway's open-door refugee policy, Mr. Hellberg said.    In a poll published in Aftenposten Sept. 3, Mr. Hagen had support from 22.2% of voters, up sharply from 3.7% in the 1985 election.    The three non-socialist parties fell to 33.1% from its 1985 standing of 45.3%, with the Conservative Party dropping to 20.8% from 30.4%. The Labor Party dropped to 31% from 40.8%.    Despite the potential effect of the Progress Party on next year's general elections, the other parties in parliament have refused to cooperate with Mr. Hagen. </TEXT></DOC>
