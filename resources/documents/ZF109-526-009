Department of Defense.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OSD Experts Seek Common Thread in DOD SystemsandM;The Office of the Secretary of Defense expects that two groups of experts whohave been studying requirements for departmentwide business systems willfinish their work by February or March.andM;Cynthia Kendall, the Defense Department's deputy comptroller for IRM, saidteams studying how civilian payroll and warehousing needs are managed withinthe services and DOD agencies probably will be the first to deliverrequirements under the corporate information management (CIM) plan.andM;CIM is the plan under which DOD so far has selected eight business areas forstandardization so as to reduce redundancy.andP;  CIM requirements in some caseswill lead to the development of what military officials like to call &quot;purple&quot;systems -- a metaphorical color arrived at when the uniforms of the Army,Navy and Air Force are stitched together.andM;But Kendall said in her remarks at the Federal Computer Conference that newacquisitions might not result immediately.andP;  OSD officials first willdetermine if there are any systems within the department that might fill mostof its needs in the specific function area.andM;This option, however, might not be very promising, Kendall said.andP;  &quot;Trying totake an existing system in one service and field it to another service can beextremely difficult,&quot; she said, noting that training costs might be high orequipment incompatible.andM;In the civilian payroll arena, she said, 32 systems now are operating in DOD,each of which grew up under unique management and mostly in proprietarytechnologies.andM;In cases where OSD chooses to pursue new acquisitions, Kendall said officialslikely will designate one service or agency as the developer and &quot;the workwill be done by that service.&quot;andM;Presumably, under such a scenario the developing service also would carry outthe acquisition, as the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) is doing for theJoint Uniform Services Technical Information System.andM;JUSTIS was launched earlier this year with Kendall's blessing after theservices agreed to merge their requirements.andP;  Officials have called it the&quot;first CIM system.&quot;andM;Several officials in the services have said that, at least in theory, thedevelopment of CIM systems could be slowed by OSD's separate attempt toconsolidate existing ADP centers and design activities.andP;  For example, CIMofficials might decide that systems should be designed at centers thatconsolidators want to eliminate.andM;Under the consolidation, for instance, AFLC's design activity atWright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, conceivably could beeliminated, leaving the status of JUSTIS up in the air.andM;Both the CIM and consolidation were ordered by Deputy Defense SecretaryDonald J. Atwood as part of the Defense Management Review (DMR), a continuingattempt by the Bush administration to streamline DOD.andM;At the GCN awards banquet last month, Atwood said the DMR effort came becausethe department has too long been accused of &quot;waste, fraud and abuse&quot; in itsmanagement activities.andM;Atwood said CIM should result in &quot;improving the data flow throughout DOD sothat we have the right kind of information available to us -- comprehensive,accurate and timely.&quot;andM;Both military and industry officials have praised CIM as a logical step forDOD.andP;  However, the data center consolidation has been greeted with skepticismand was delayed this summer when an executive-level group of industry andacademic advisers to the CIM effort was asked to examine a plan to reduce 42ADP centers to 18 regional &quot;magnet&quot; centers.andM;The group returned that plan to OSD with questions about its geographicstructure, one official said.andP;  The 42 sites were arrived at from more than100 when the services submitted their own plans for consolidation lastspring.andM;An official recently said there is a possibility that OSD will accept thoseplans and maintain 42 sites under a central authority.andM;At the conference, Kendall said a decision on the consolidation might notcome until next year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
