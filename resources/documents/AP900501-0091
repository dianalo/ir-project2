Authorities outlawed smoking in cinemas and buses and orderedsegregated smoking areas to be set up in government buildings,trains, schools, libraries, hospitals, airports, supermarkets,restaurants and art galleries.   Health inspectors will make spot checks throughout the country,with the power to fine offenders up to $160. Owners or managersfailing to enforce the ban can be fined up to $800.   Restaurateurs were angered that the ban does not apply to pubsor bars.   ``There seem to be two laws,'' said Henry O'Neill, head of theRestaurant Owners Association. ``Publicans (pubkeepers) have goneinto food in a major way yet they are not restricted. It isunfair.''   Ireland already bars tobacco advertising on radio and TV, andthe Health Department said it hopes ``the new laws will be thefinal pieces in the jigsaw of the government's anti-smokingpolicy.''   Patrick MacNutt, a Galway University economics lecturer, said hedoes not smoke but sees the ban as government interference.   ``An individual right has been relegated to an imposed rule,''MacNutt said.   Richard Miller, director of the Dublin-based Edmund BurkeInstitute which campaigns for individual rights, doubted the banwould be enforced.   He said it was introduced ``to satisfy the demand forregulations and to enable Ireland to look modern, progressive andtrendy.''   Irish smokers have declined to 27 percent of the population from45 percent in 1975. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs $3.20, of whichthe government takes 67 percent in taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
