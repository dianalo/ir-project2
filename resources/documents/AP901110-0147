Pentagon officials, speaking privately, said the troop buildupwould likely not be completed until early next year.   The additional 200,000 men and women that Bush ordered to thegulf Thursday will give the United States a clear offensivepotential against Iraq which now holds an advantage in numbers oftroops in the gulf area.   The move also will mean a huge drain on U.S. military manpowerelsewhere and thus will kill plans for relieving some wearysoldiers in the gulf with fresh troops.   ---andequals;   MIAMI (AP) - In a fight over freedom of the press, Cable NewsNetwork defied a federal court judge by broadcasting tapes ofprison telephone calls between ousted Panamanian dictator ManuelNoriega and his defense team.   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys onlyminutes before Friday's broadcast that he would hold the network incontempt if the tapes were played. No immediate contempt citationwas issued.   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's order was anunconstitutional violation of freedom of the press, but Hoevelersaid it was necessary to guarantee Noriega's right to a fair trialon drug-trafficking charges.   ``Here we have a novel problem - the right of the accused tohave a fair trial,'' the judge said. ``We lose sight of the factthat to satisfy the clamor of the reading and listening public, (wejeopardize) the right of the defendant, and that is the right I amgoing to protect.''   ---andequals;   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Shabby writing spurred a judge to order thedismissal of more than half the securities fraud charges againstLincoln Savings and Loan tycoon Charles H. Keating Jr. unlessprosecutors can whip them into shape.   Twenty-two of the 42 counts Keating faces were flawed, SuperiorCourt Judge Lance Ito ruled Friday, saying 20 of the poorly writtencharges do not mention a crime.   Ito gave federal prosecutors until Nov. 19 to submit a revisedindictment. The next hearing was set for Dec. 3.   Those 20 counts allege defendants Keating, former Lincolnpresidents Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes, and AmericanContinental president Judy J. Wischer sold junk bonds in ways thatexceeded authority given them by the state Department ofCorporations. The department also approved the bond sales.   ---andequals;   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - John Sununu, President Bush's top adviser,is gone but not forgotten in his home state, where bitterness overhis lingering political influence is building after this week'selection.   Gov. Judd Gregg blamed Sununu this week for the stunning upsetof a fellow Republican seeking re-election to Congress, while otherGOP leaders said it is time for the former governor to butt out ofNew Hampshire politics.   The White House said Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, would haveno comment on the controversy.   The feud went public when Gregg said Sununu and his wife, Nancy,were at least partly to blame for Democrat Dick Swett'scongressional victory over freshman Rep. Chuck Douglas in Tuesday'selection.   ---andequals;   WASHINGTON (AP) - The masthead on a newsletter that followseconomic indicators is red for the first time in eight years,flashing a warning that the nation's economy may be headed for arecession.
