The Marxist-led guerrillas, who throughout the 9-year-old civilwr have rejected elections as a ``farce,'' set several otherconditions in what they termed ``a political proposal to contributeto peace.''   Presidential elections are scheduled for March 19. The guerrillasproposed they be postponed until Sept. 15.   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte was studying theproposal and had no immediate reaction. The rightist party, Arena,which is leading the governing Christian Democrats in the polls,opposes any postponement.   The rebel proposal is contained in a document signed by the topfive guerrilla commanders. It is to be made public at a newsconference in Mexico City on Tuesday.   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposal on Monday,the day the document was dated by its signers.   The insurgents set several conditions in addition to postponingthe election:   _ Halting what it terms the armed forces' repression of labor andcampesino leaders and of street demonstrations.   _ Confining military and police personnel to barracks on electionday.   _ Awarding a seat on the Central Elections Council to theDemocratic Convergence, a leftist electoral alliance whose leadershave maintained political links to the rebel army, and forming awatchdog panel to guarantee the integrity of the vote count.   _ Revising the electoral code through negotiations among allparties.   _ Respecting absentee ballots cast by Salvadorans who have leftthe country during the war.   _ Requiring the United States to stay out of the electoralprocess and forbidding U.S. aid to any contending party.   The guerrilla army _ known as the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front _ said it commits itself to the following if theconditions are met:   _ Respecting the political activity of all parties and allgovernment election authorities.   _ Respecting the lives of mayors, unless the mayors carry outmilitary-related functions.   _ A truce beginning two days before the election date and endingtwo days after elections.   _ Participation of what the guerrillas called its ``entire socialbase'' in the campaign and election activity. The rebels, who haveboycotted and tried to sabotage previous elections, said they wouldcall for full participation. They also endorsed the candidates ofthe Democratic Convergence.   _ ``The FMLN would accept the legitimacy of the the electoralresult.''   _ Continuation of the present Christian Democratic governmentuntil elections are carried out.   Duarte was cloistered with Roman Catholic Archbishop ArturoRivera Damas on Monday afternoon to discuss the guerrilla document.   The rebels gave Rivera Damas the proposal on Friday in MexicoCity.   ``The FMLN calls on all the social forces of the country to takea position on this proposal and expresses its willingness to discussit immediately with the government, the Legislative Assembly, thearmed forces and all the political parties,'' the document said.   The guerrillas said Rivera Damas ``can contribute to thearrangement of these conversations.''   ``An electoral process carried out in the conditions we proposewould make possible an irreversible political solution to theconflict,'' the rebel commanders said.   The document does not mention any halt to fighting other than thefive-day truce coinciding with the election. The guerrillas havealways maintained that the mere fact of civil war made free and fairelections impossible.   It was unclear how they believed legitimate elections could bestaged if fighting continues up to election day.   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of themcivilians. Politically motivated slayings of civilians by governmentforces, rightist death squads and the guerrillas rose sharply in1988 compared with the previous year.   The guerrillas killed nine mayors last year for helping implementwhat the rebels term ``the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''Seventy more have resigned after reportedly receiving Front deaththreats.   The Christian Democratic candidate is lawyer Fidel Chavez Mena.   Alfredo Cristiani is the candidate of the rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance, or Arena. Arena trounced the incumbents inlegislative and municipal elections last March, and are leading theChristian Democrats in recent polls.   Armando Calderon Sol, the mayor of San Salvador and a top Arenaleader, told journalists last week his party ``would like theelections to be held tommorrow.'' The rightists believe they stillhave a head of steam from last year's vote.   Mons. Gregorio Rosa Chavez, San Salvador's auxiliary archbishop,said after Sunday's Mass the guerrilla proposal was ``interesting''and expressed the hope it prompts renewed dialogue aimed at endingthe war.   Three rounds of guerrilla-government peace talks between 1984 and1987 ended in stalemate.   The document is signed by Roberto Roca, Shafik Handal, JoaquinVillalobos, Leonel Gonzalez and Ferman Cienfuegos, the commanders ofthe five guerrilla armies that make up the FMLN.</TEXT></DOC>
