To Report a Deficit</HL><DD> 07/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> VNCP </IN><DATELINE> PHOENIX, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Valley National Corp. said it added $135 million to its reserve for credit losses, primarily for loans to &quot;less developed countries,&quot; and will report a second-quarter net loss of about $63 million as a result.    In recent months, a number of banks have added to their reserves to cover for foreign debt. Valley, which has $180 million in loans outstanding to Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines, said the increase brings its total reserve for credit losses to about $225 million, or 2.9% of its $7.8 billion of total loans.    In the 1986 second quarter, Valley had net income of $20.8 million, or $1.24 a share. Valley also said it will post a net loss of about $42 million for the first six months, compared with earnings of $40 million, or $2.39 a share, for the year-earlier six-month period.    Valley added that it expects to report net income of about $10 million for the year, compared with net of $83.2 million, or $4.97 a share in 1986.    Valley said the credit loss provision won't affect cash dividends. The bank holding company paid a regular quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share June 15. </TEXT></DOC>
