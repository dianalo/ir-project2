After outlining our motivation for reexaminingthe EPF paper, we review the history of this experiment, which is describedin some detail. A phenomenological framework is developed for describingthe EPF and other similar experiments, and this then applied to analyzingthe EPF data. We show that these data evidence a strong correlation betweenthe measured fractional acceleration differences of various sample pairsof materials and the corresponding differences of baryon number-to-massratios. Such a correlation can result from a coupling of the test massesto an intermediate-range field whose source is baryon number, and itis shown that the properties of this field which emerge from geophysicaldata provide a fair description of the EPF results. We further demonstratethat no other known mechanism either conventional or otherwise, providesan adequate explanation of these data. Various experiments to check theEPF results are described, and in the Appendix we analyze the effectsof local mass inhomogeneities which appear to represent the dominantsources in Eoetvoes-like experiments. copyright 1988 Academic Press,Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
