Of Texas Extends Offer On Debt Redemption </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FBT GOVMT </CO><IN> BBK TNM BNK </IN><DATELINE> HOUSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc. said it extended its offer to redeem $225.8 million of long-term debt because it has received less than half the amount required to complete its $1.5 billion federal bailout.    The offer, at deep discounts to face value, was set to expire yesterday but was extended to 5 p.m EST next Tuesday. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is requiring that 90% of the debt be tendered for First City's proposed takeover by an investor group led by A. Robert Abboud.    At best, the extension could delay completion of First City's rescue. First City has targeted the end of March for completion of its bailout, and a spokesman said the bank still expects to close the transaction by then. At worst, a failure to gain the required 90% could bring an end to the rescue. But the FDIC would likely further extend the offer and perhaps sweeten it rather than absorb a huge bank failure. The spokesman declined to comment on what might happen if next week's deadline isn't met.    As of the close of business yesterday, the bank holding company, which has racked up huge losses from soured real estate and energy loans, said it had received tenders for about $93.6 million, or 41.4% of the face amount outstanding.    Last Friday, First City holders approved the rescue plan at a special meeting. Of the shares voted, 94% approved the plan; of the total shares outstanding, 71% approved it. The plan required approval by two-thirds of all common and preferred shares.    The deep discount -- First City is offering 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar for the four separate issues -- is causing some debt holders to balk at the offer and hold up the deal. Holders' losses on the tender would total $134.2 million if the swap were fully redeemed. Several large bondholders have said privately that they don't plan to tender their debt. A First City spokesman declined to comment on the low tender rate.    The bank offered 45 cents on the dollar to holders of its $75.5 million face amount of floating rate notes due 1995; its $50 million face amount of 13 1/4% notes due 1992; and its $511,000 face amount of redeemable floating rate restricted debentures due 1991. The bank offered 35 cents on the dollar for its $100 million face amount of floating rate subordinated notes due 1996.    The bank spokesman said that the bank will step up its effort to gain the 90% tender by placing advertisements and through direct mailings to holders. </TEXT></DOC>
