Many experts have contended that the deposits put together bybrokers in $100,000 blocks _ the maximum insured by the government _at above-market interest rates and then loaned out for high-riskventures such as shopping centers caused some Sandamp;Ls to sink intoinsolvency as the loans went bad.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman told the Senate Banking Committeeon Tuesday that the regulations would be proposed ``very shortly.''   Agency officials said the regulation initially would apply onlyto the 8,000 banks that the agency supervises until Congresscompletes legislation proposed by President Bush that would put Sandamp;Lsunder FDIC jurisdiction.   But Seidman said it would apply to Sandamp;Ls then as well. Andofficials said that they expect Congress to act on President Bush'sSandamp;L bailout package well before the FDIC can issue the new brokereddeposit regulations in their final form.   Under the proposal, any bank or savings institution seeking toincrease its loan portfolio by more than 36 percent a year throughthe use of brokered deposits or any other means would have to getprior approval from the FDIC, officials said.   For the past two years, the FDIC has been requiring banks tosubmit quarterly reports on their brokered deposits. But regulatorssaid that is an after-the-fact reporting requirement only.   The new regulation, they said, would give the agency pre-emptiveauthority to stop a bank or Sandamp;L from seeking such deposits ifofficials believed they were going to be used to finance overlyrisky ventures.   ``They wouldn't be allowed to grow by using (high deposit) rateslike that unless they could show they had a good use for themoney,'' Seidman said after the committee hearing.   In the three weeks since Bush announced his Sandamp;L bailout plan andthe FDIC has taken supervision over 36 insolvent savingsinstitutions, the agency already has stopped one of them in Houstonfrom seeking more brokered deposits, an official said.   After Congress deregulated Sandamp;Ls in the early 1980s, many of them_ particularly in Texas, California and Florida with their morelenient banking laws _ grew several-fold in size through the use ofbrokered deposits.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in testifying before theBanking Committee last week, had defended the use of brokereddeposits, saying they provided many Sandamp;Ls with liquidity that theyotherwise wouldn't have had.   But Greenspan acknowledged that the high-interest deposits hadcreated a spiraling effect that contributed to the current Sandamp;Lcrisis, and he said he felt ``uncomfortable'' about them in someinstances.</TEXT></DOC>
