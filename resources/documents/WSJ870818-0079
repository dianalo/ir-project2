SesitStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar fell against most major currencies in quiet trading as the market sought to recover from the U.S. currency's plunge at the end of last week.    &quot;Right now we're taking a breather from Friday's disaster,&quot; Frederick Scala, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. The dollar fell steeply Friday after the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit widened to $15.71 billion in June from a revised $14.04 billion in May. Many analysts had expected a deficit of $13 billion to $13.5 billion.    Mr. Scala quoted an analyst in Europe as saying, &quot;I expected (the dollar) to move from 1.89 to 1.87 (West German) marks, but I expected it in two weeks, rather than two minutes, which is what happened.&quot;    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 1.8700 marks and 149.23 Japanese yen, compared with 1.8778 marks and 149.94 yen late Friday. The British pound rose to $1.5945 from $1.5880.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 148.70 yen.    Friday's trade figures deflated the optimism that had surrounded the dollar lately and led some dealers to turn bearish. Noting that many people still hold long, or overbought, dollar positions, Yani Budiman, a vice president at Chemical Bank, New York, said, &quot;If those who are stuck with long dollars start unwinding, the dollar will trade a little bit lower.&quot;    Traders said the dollar got some support from continued tension in the Middle East and from other recent U.S. economic data that were more positive than the trade figures.    &quot;There's a lot more money to be made selling the dollar short,&quot; Mr. Scala said. But he said he expects it to settle in the range of 1.84 to 1.87 marks that it held much of last month. &quot;I think that's what the central banks want,&quot; he said.    Some analysts said they wonder whether the relative calm of yesterday's market will last, in light of the large U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;The question is what central banks will give priority to,&quot; Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, said. &quot;It isn't clear how they will respond to two potentially conflicting targets: short-term currency stability and indicators of short-term inflationary pressures.&quot;    Central banks often respond to inflationary pressures by raising interest rates. If traders anticipate a weaker dollar, higher interest rates abroad would bolster foreign currencies against the dollar even more.    Several central banks have shown a willingness this month to intervene to calm volatile markets, particularly to slow the rise of the dollar. But monetary officials, especially in Japan and Britain, are growing increasingly concerned about inflation in their countries.    Japan's unadjusted wholesale price index leaped 0.9% in July, its biggest gain in seven years, according to Salomon Brothers. Japanese officials also are concerned about the inflationary impact of speculation in the property and stock markets, Japan's expanding industrial production and a 3% rise last month in import prices, mostly from higher oil prices.    The Bank of England also is said to be concerned about the inflationary impact of higher commodity prices, rising wage settlements and growth of domestic credit. Early this month, the central bank surprised the market by causing a full-point rise in major British banks' base lending rates.    West Germany, meanwhile, faces a stagnant economy and falling wholesale prices. Salomon's Mr. Schoenholtz said, however, that although growth in the West German money supply has receded, it remains above the official target range of 3% to 6% at its current annual rate of 7.4%.    Robert H. Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank in New York,said, &quot;There's been concern in all the major countries except the U.S. about the rapid growth in money and credit.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery rose $2 to $454 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, Aug. 17, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
