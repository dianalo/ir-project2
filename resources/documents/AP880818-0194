A report in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said the death tollamong harbor seals off Sweden's west coast had reached more than5,000, or 75 percent of the area's harbor seal population.   Seals in other regional waters have also died. An estimatedtotal of 7,000 harbor seals have died since April, about half thepopulation in the North Sea waters of West Germany, theNetherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.   Divers from Greenpeace, an international environmental group,plugged the pipeline dumping chemical waste from the NCB wood pulpplant in Vallvik, 140 miles north of Stockholm, the national newsagency TT reported.   They stopped up 28 of 30 outlets on the pipeline in about anhour, but abandoned their operation after talks with companyofficials. The company's production manager promised the protestershe would take up their complaints with the board of directors, TTreported.   Other activists climbed the plant's 300-foot chimney with abanner reading ``Beautiful Promises, Dead Seas'' to slam thegovernment's failure to curb discharges at the plant, the newsagency said.   Greenpeace said the factory washed about 7,900 gallons perminute of waste containing toxic chlorine into the Baltic Sea.   Activists from the group also stood vigil outside the primeminister's office where the conference was held, demonstrating withsix black-painted oil barrels representing a total of 858 metrictons of toxic heavy metals which they say are discharged into theBaltic and North seas per day. A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205pounds or 1.1 short tons.   Meanwhile, the emergency international meeting of governmentscentific advisers and members of ministries called Thursday formore resources and research to rescue the North and Baltic seasfrom what they described as the threat of death by pollution.   The one-day conference concluded that future action should zeroin on the most serious pollutants in one of the world's mostheavily populated industrial areas, but no list of priorities wasdrawn up.   Opening the meeting, Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlssonannounced the creation of a government-funded InternationalInstitute for Environmentally Sound Technology.   Carlsson initiated the meeting with letters last month to 13heads of government following the discovery of a mysterious viralepidemic devastating seal herds. Environmentalists and others werealso worried about a bloom of poisonous algae choking tons of NorthSea fish to death.   Environmentalists maintain the seal-killing virus, which reducesimmunity and leads to pneumonia, was caused by pollution. Butscientists have failed to pinpoint the origins of the disease.   Environment Minister Brigitta Dahl told a concluding newsconference that Britain and the East bloc countries at the meeting_ the Soviet Union, Poland and East Germany _ showed noreservations about tightening pollution controls. They had beencriticized in the past as the worst offenders.</TEXT></DOC>
