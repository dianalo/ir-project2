One hundred andten patients had intravenous DSA, and 20 patients had transbrachial intraarterialDSA. No major complications were experienced. ''Good'' or ''excellent''images were obtained in 113 cases (87 %). In 22 patients with malignantovarian tumors, dilatation of ovarian artery (68 %), dilatation of uterineartery (50 %), and tumor stain (59 %) were demonstrated on DSA images.In contrast, only a few cases showed dilatation of feeding artery ortumor stain in 50 patients with benign ovarian tumors. In 54 patientswith uterine tumors, only 3 cases showed dilatation of ovarian artery,though dilatation of uterine artery was noted in 41 cases (76 %). Itwas concluded that DSA was a safe and useful imaging modality in differentialdiagnosis of gynecologic mass lesions, especially for suspected malignantovarian tumors, and for those in which origin was equivocal on otherimaging modalities.</TEXT></DOC>
