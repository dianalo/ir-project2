The big city pension fund said it sold the shares for $86.3 million, realizing a gain of $32.4 million over the $53.9 million purchase price. Previously, the system had divested itself of stock valued at $92.6 million in 17 companies that operate in South Africa.    &quot;There should be no mistake: these are not innocent corporations caught in a situation they cannot control,&quot; said Harrison J. Goldin, city comptroller, in a statement. &quot;They sell essential materials and services to South Africa . . . and refuse to guarantee equal opportunity to black South Africans.&quot;    The nine companies are: Air Express International Corp.; American Cyanamid Co.; Dresser Industries Inc.; Echlin Inc.; Joy Manufacturing Co.; Monsanto Co.; Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.; Schlumberger Ltd., and Timken Co.    A spokesman for American Cyanamid said the company &quot;feels badly&quot; about the decision but is &quot;committed to employees in South Africa.&quot;    A Dresser spokesman declined to comment.    A spokesman for Echlin said of the retirement system, &quot;We are sorry to lose them as shareholders. We employ a fair number of blacks, (and) the sanctions are not really that effective, as proved in Rhodesia.&quot; He added that &quot;shareholders voted (divestiture) down last December.&quot;    A spokesman for Monsanto said the company was not aware of any statement made by the New York City Employee's Retirement System, so he would &quot;not comment on the substance of what they are alleging.&quot; He said the company has &quot;consistently adhered to the Sullivan Principles.&quot; The Sullivan Principles are a set of corporate guidelines to promote fair treatment of South Africa's black workers.    A Royal Dutch spokesman said the company &quot;opposes apartheid and has stated this repeatedly, yet some people continue to grossly misrepresent&quot; its position.&quot;    The other companies' executives couldn't be reached for comment Friday afternoon. </TEXT></DOC>
