The forest products company also reported fourth-quarter earnings grew 14% and profit for the full year more than tripled.    MacMillan Bloedel said the stock split is subject to shareholder approval at the annual meeting March 26. The preferred share redemption, effective March 20, involves 1,898,399 Class B, Series 2 shares. The price paid will be $26 a share, plus accrued dividends amounting to 10.739 cents.    The company noted that holders have the option of converting each preferred share into .64764 common shares. If all preferred shares are converted, MacMillan Bloedel said it would issue about 1.2 million common shares. The company currently has about 31.2 million common shares outstanding.    On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, MacMillan Bloedel shares closed at $61.75, up $2.25.    For the fourth quarter, net rose to $23.3 million, or 48 cents a share, from $20.4 million, or 43 cents, in the year-earlier period. Sales declined 10% to $542.2 million from $601.7 million.    or the year, net rose to $178.3 million, or $4.66 a share, from $42.9 million, or 54 cents a share in 1985. The latest results include an extraordinary gain of $45 million on the sale of part of MacMillan Bloedel's stake in a Dutch paper company. Before the gain, operating profit was $133.3 million or $3.21 a share. Sales for the year rose 7.5% to $2.51 billion from $2.34 billion in 1985.    The company attributed its improved performance to reduced costs and higher forest product prices, partly offset by a five-month strike in British Columbia by members of the International Woodworkers of America. </TEXT></DOC>
