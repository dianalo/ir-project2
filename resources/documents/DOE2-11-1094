Seam thickness fluctuations are accompanied by2 types of tectonic disturbances: variations of seam dip angles withor without increase in seam thickness, variations of seam dip anglesaccompanied by decrease in seam thickness, changes of lithological profileof sedimentary strata in the direct roof and disjunctive dislocations.Two types of tectonic disturbances are accompanied by so-called mesotectonicstructures. Analysis of the mesotectonic structures supplies informationon position of tectonic disturbances and permits accurate forecastingof dip angle fluctuations, fault position, etc. Geophysical surveys (seismicsurveys) supply additional information on character and position of tectonicdisturbances. Analysis of mesotectonic structures combined with seismicsurveys is an efficient and economic way of forecasting faults, washoutzones and of planning longwall mining. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
