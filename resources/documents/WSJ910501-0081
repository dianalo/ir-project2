In an interview, Soviet Deputy Prime Minister VladimirShcherbakov said he presided over talks Saturday and Sundayat a dacha outside Moscow with representatives of all 15Soviet republics except Estonia and Georgia. The groupconsidered a proposal to coordinate economic relations anddilute some of the central government's control over economicmatters, he said.</LP><TEXT>   The meetings were attended by representatives fromLithuania and three other independence-minded republics thathave spent the past year in emotionally charged struggles tobreak away from the Soviet Union. Two of them, Moldavia andArmenia, signed working documents of the meeting, indicatingthey had officially participated in the discussions.   But Lithuanian officials say they believe it is impossibleto separate economic and political issues. They say there hasbeen no change in their pro-independence drive and that theydon't want to be a part of the Soviet Union or the kind offuture economic agreement which was under discussion.   They avoided the appearance of official participation inthe discussions by declining to sign the documents. &quot;We dowant an economic agreement, but not one that keeps uspolitically in the Soviet Union,&quot; said a spokeswoman.   Latvian officials couldn't be reached for comment. But theLithuanian spokeswoman said that republic also didn't signthe working documents.   Mr. Shcherbakov was optimistic that all the republicspresent at the meetings would join the new proposed economicunion. He said that they were all actively participating inthe discussions and that their new willingness could beattributed to a realization that they can't surviveeconomically if they leave the union. &quot;Out of the six thathave rather dubious political inclinations, four haverealized they can't live without a single economy,&quot; Mr.Shcherbakov said.   Mr. Shcherbakov described the negotiations as &quot;newpolitics&quot; born of the need for survival. Since perestroika,he said, &quot;The economy has become a hostage to politicalambitions. Now economics have forced politicians tonegotiate.&quot;   In addition, he said the Kremlin is trying to move aheadmore quickly to hammer out compromises on the most pressingeconomic questions. The central budget this year has beendeprived of at least 60% of its expected allocations as somerepublics have been holding back their contributions toprotest the Kremlin's continued insistence on centralcontrol. Thousands of coal miners have been on strike formore than two months and numerous other labor strikes haveoccurred off and on in recent weeks.   Last weekend's economic talks follow Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev's breakthrough agreement reached last weekwith nine republican leaders, including Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin. After the announcement of the agreementbetween the nine republics to work together, Mr. Scherbakovsaid he sent out invitations to all 15 republics to come tothe dacha and work out details of an economic treaty. All therepublics responded and wanted to attend, but Estonia andGeorgia were excluded because they sought only observerstatus, he said.   Lithuania says it didn't request observer status becauseit didn't consider the meeting to be a formal gathering.   Mr. Shcherbakov described the meeting as a working sessionin which every representative was authorized by hisgovernment to participate. The documents drafted Mondayevening were to be taken by the representatives back to theirrepublics for discussion over the May 1 international laborday holiday. They will then return to Moscow for finaldiscussions, he said.   While noting that &quot;everybody has a different idea of themeaning of sovereignty,&quot; Mr. Shcherbakov said that under thenew proposed economic arrangements, the center would setoverall economic and social goals, leaving details -- such asthe timing and scope of reforms -- up to the republics. Thecenter, he said, will remain responsible for nationalsecurity and basic branches of industry, such as energy andtransportation. But he said &quot;almost everything else comesunder the jurisdiction of republics.&quot;   In addition, financial obligations of the republics willbe reduced in the future when prices are liberalized in 1992,removing the need for heavy government subsidies for food andother products, he said. &quot;We will create a completely newsystem of expenditures and payments,&quot; Mr. Shcherbakov said.   Part of the new system will include a series ofcommissions for each section of the economy. Each commissionwill be composed of one central government minister and aminister from each of the republics. They will decide on thecoordination of such affairs as banking, currency, customsand military development, he said.   Some republics, despite Mr. Shcherbakov's assertions,still think they can survive without the Kremlin. Lithuaniayesterday announced that it is preparing a special economicprogram for its transition to trade with the Soviet Union asa foreign country at world prices.</TEXT></DOC>
