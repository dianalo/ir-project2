Sun, a maker of computer workstations, said it willoperate the companies as wholly owned subsidiaries. One newsubsidiary, SunSoft Inc., will develop and market Unixoperating software and user interfaces written for Sun'sSparc computer architecture. Edward J. Zander, formerly vicepresident of marketing at Sun, was named president ofSunSoft.</LP><TEXT>   The other new subsidiary, SunTech Enterprises Inc., willmanage so-called value-added products, such as Sun's printersand software used to connect Sun machines to other computers.Eric E. Schmidt, previously vice president of Sun's generalsystems group, will be the unit's president.   The new companies will be fully operational July 1, Sunsaid.   Sun President Scott G. McNealy said that splitting off thebusinesses will help the company focus its various productsbetter in specific markets. Until now, he said, &quot;we have hadtoo many products going out through one monolithic $3 billionsales organization.&quot;   The move is also meant to allay criticism in the industrythat Sun, by selling both machines and the software needed torun them, has an unfair advantage against other computermakers that hope to use Sun's Sparc architecture in &quot;clone&quot;machines. But now, because the two new companies will beresponsible for their own profits and losses, analysts saythey wouldn't be inclined to give Sun early access to newtechnologies. So, &quot;clone manufacturers have a level playingfield,&quot; Mr. McNealy said.</TEXT></DOC>
