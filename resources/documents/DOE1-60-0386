A short history is first give of the major milestonesin the development of the stochastic particle method for calculatingliquid fuel sprays. The most recent advance has been the discovery ofthe importance of drop breakup in engine sprays. They present a new method,called the TAB method, for calculating drop breakup. Some theoreticalproperties of the method are derived; its numerical implementation inthe computer program KIVA is described; and comparisons are presentedbetween TAB-method calculations and experiments and calculations usinganother breakup model.</TEXT></DOC>
