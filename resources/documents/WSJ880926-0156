The company, which provides data-processing systems and services to health-care facilities, attributed the expected decline to delays in integrating its recently acquired Databill Inc. unit, seasonal factors and continued slow sales for large systems.    CyCare shares closed at $8.625, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.    CyCare said the third-quarter problems won't be reflected in fourth-quarter results, which analysts have projected at about 20 cents a share. In the 1987 fourth quarter, the company had net income of $101,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $18.7 million. But those results included a one-time charge of $1.7 million, or 19 cents a share, for reserves on amounts owed by a client in receivership.    The company said it expects earnings for the year to exceed &quot;substantially&quot; its 1987 net income of $3.7 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $67.7 million. The year-earlier results reflected the $1.7 million fourth-quarter charge and a $1.5 million one-time gain for an accounting change. </TEXT></DOC>
