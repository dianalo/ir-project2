It is assumed that the lowerplate is stationary and the upper one is moving with a constant velocity.Using Laplace transforms and calculus of residues, velocity distributionis obtained for three different cases, viz. (i) due to sudden stoppageof the moving plate, (ii) due to sudden removal of the electromagneticfield, and (iii) due to sudden stoppage of the moving plate and simultaneousremoval of the electromagnetic field. The effect of magnetic field andelasticity on velocity distribution is discussed with the help of tables.(author). 7 refs., 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
