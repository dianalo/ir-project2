The company also said it will explore the possible sale of various aluminum operations, or their combination in joint ventures.    A spokesman said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Citicorp Investment Bank, a unit of Citicorp, will help find buyers for all or part its chemicals business, which KaiserTech said had year-end assets of $284.4 million. The company said Salomon Brothers also will help find possible buyers or joint-venture partners for KaiserTech's aluminum operations, which the company said had year-end assets of $2.56 billion.    A KaiserTech spokesman declined to say whether the company has had conversations with any potential buyers.    The announcement follows the successful takeover of the company by a group headed by investor Alan E. Clore, who in April assumed the posts of KaiserTech chairman and chief executive officer when the holding company for Kaiser Aluminum was formed. Mr. Clore controls a company that holds 31% of KaiserTech's stock.    James S. Pasman, who Mr. Clore recently named chairman and chief executive officer of the aluminum and chemicals unit, said the bulk of proceeds from any &quot;cash-generating transactions&quot; would be used to reduce the company's corporate debt. He also said the company would evaluate offers on the basis of what will provide the best return for shareholders and be in the best interests of customers and employees.    Investment analyst E. Magnus Oppenheim of E. Magnus Oppenheim andamp; Co. Inc. said the announcment means that new management wants to speed up previously announced plans to reduce debt by about $350 million this year. </TEXT></DOC>
