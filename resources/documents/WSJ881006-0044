Stocks posted solid gains in London and Frankfurt.    A late Tokyo rally concentrated in railways and banks helped indexes trim their losses, but electrical stocks, which fell sharply early in the afternoon session and dragged the indexes with them, failed to recover.    The Nikkei index closed at 27405.49, down 95.53 points. The index abruptly dropped about 100 points at the outset of the afternoon session on the selling of the electricals, which some traders said came largely from trust funds.    The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section closed at 2116.76, down 13.02 points. First section volume was estimated at one billion shares, up from 950 million shares Tuesday.    In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell 81.47 points to 27324.02 in the first 15 minutes of trading.    Few electricals posted huge losses Wednesday, but almost all were down substantially. The average of all the electricals listed in the Nikkei index was down about 2.3%.    Sony fell 150 yen to 6,100 yen ($45.75), while Hitachi was down 60 to 1,560, and Toshiba was down 50 to 1,040. Toshiba was among the most actively traded electricals, as 12.3 million shares changed hands.    NEC fell 70 to 1,850, and Fujitsu fell 70 to 1,560.    Traders said that trust funds were heavy sellers of the electricals. Some speculated that a number of funds are approaching maturity and building up cash to be ready for settlement with customers.    Most analysts expect the market to remain quiet for the remainder of this week. They say the combination of the Friday release of U.S. unemployment figures, the approaching three-day weekend in Japan and the emperor's critical illness are all damping the market.    London share prices ended higher as players scurried to cover short positions in a rising market. Dealers also said participants were encouraged by the market's resilience Tuesday in the face of bearish news.    The Financial Times 100-share index closed 19.0 points higher at 1826.3. The 30-share index was up 14.1 points at 1471.7. By recent standards, volume was relatively healthy, as 570.8 million shares changed hands, compared with the 442.3 million traded Tuesday.    The buoyant market was created by short players who had to play catch-up with the rising market, dealers said. &quot;By far and away, the biggest upward push came from the bears,&quot; one equity salesman said.    One salesman said shares went higher in the absence of selling pressure. In addition, players now feel more confident about entering the market after its rally late Tuesday in the face of &quot;awful&quot; news of a rights issue and bid by Grand Metropolitan and the government-ordered reduction of Kuwait Investment Office's stake in British Petroleum.    &quot;People have looked into the abyss of gloom and believe they've seen the worst,&quot; one market-maker said, adding that over the past several weeks, players have discounted in turn recession, inflation, the U.S. presidential election and a sterling collapse. &quot;It's just not that pessimistic,&quot; he said.    The exceptions to the upward trend included shares in Grand Met, off 10 pence to 444 pence ($7.50), after losing 32 pence Tuesday. The shares continued to be saddled with a bit of &quot;indigestion&quot; after Grand Met's bid for Pillsbury Co. of the U.S. and a big rights issue.    Building and building materials shares as well as retailers were favored in the climate of receding interest rates, traders said.    Among the major movers, Ready Mixed Concrete added 10 to 501, Redland rose 7 to 425, Burtons rose 11 to 204, and Next jumped 10 to 179.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed broadly higher in thin trading, helped by positive economic data from West Germany. The DAX index rose 6.73 points to close at 1252.31.    After resuming its advance in midsession Tuesday, the stock market received a further boost by a surprisingly big decline in the West German unemployment rate in September and sharply higher August wholesale sales.    Although these reports contributed to a bullish mood on the floor, trading volume remained thin and prevented the market from posting any stronger gains, brokers said.    Automobile shares paced the market, with Volkswagen soaring 4.8 marks to 275.8 marks ($148), and Daimler-Benz climbing 4.5 to 698. VW, which said it would post at least 9% higher net income this year, has been buoyed by speculation of a dividend increase in recent days.    Electronics group Siemens was also helped again by rumors of a higher dividend. The stock gained 3 to 475.5, partly in response to the reorganization program announced Monday, brokers said.    In the financial sector, insurance group Allianz surged 20 to 1,723 after announcing higher pretax profits, a steady dividend, and 8% higher premium income for 1988.    Dresdner Bank, in which Allianz is rumored to be building up a stake, added 2.9 to 291, and Deutsche Bank climbed 3.5 to 520.5.    Elsewhere, share prices finished higher in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Zurich and mixed in Paris and Stockholm.    The Paris session was dominated by portfolio rotation in favor of banking issues that had lagged behind the market's previous gain. The general market indicator closed with a retreat of 0.07% in light trading. But advances edged out declines 95 to 92, and 19 stocks were unchanged.    Share prices closed lower in Taipei, Sydney, Seoul and Singapore, were mixed in Hong Kong and Wellington and higher in Manila.    Taipei prices plunged for the sixth consecutive session as low investor confidence continued to pervade the market. Brokers cited little buying interest. Of 150 issues traded, 139 issues had the maximum daily losses of 3%.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
