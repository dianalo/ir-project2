Aprogram that screens low-income women for breast and cervicalcancer would grow 40% from the current year to $70 million,according to administration budget documents.   Funding for a program to fight infant mortality wouldnearly double to $124 million. Increases are also sought forseveral immunization programs, including a 16% boost for aCenters for Disease Control vaccination service.   The White House plans to have National Institutes ofHealth research grants increase 2% faster than the inflationrate, and some of that increase is expected to go to acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome. But it would hold the line onfunding for several treatment and prevention programs.Legislation named after Ryan White, a teenager who died ofAIDS, that authorizes federal grants to help communitiesprovide care and early intervention for AIDS patients wouldhave its funding remain at $316 million.   The budget documents don't specify precisely how much HHSwould spend on every AIDS-related program and don't providean overall total for departmental spending on AIDS.   Overall, the White House is seeking to increase HHSspending authority by $50 billion to more than $665 billionin fiscal 1993. The total includes such entitlement programsas Medicare, which provides health coverage for the elderlyand disabled.</TEXT></DOC>
