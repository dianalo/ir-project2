Chen, a leading supercomputer designer who recently quit Cray Research Inc., has formed a new company that will occupy an abandoned factory here today.    The company, SuperComputer Systems Inc., is expected to pursue the design of an advanced machine using lasers that Mr. Chen hopes will be the world's most powerful computer. Mr. Chen was working on the design at Cray until last month, when the Minneapolis-based company scrapped the program after he refused to scale it back.    The new concern negotiated a one-year lease with the City of Eau Claire for the 11,200-square-foot plant and office building formerly occupied by Detroit-based Unisys Inc. Under the agreement, Mr. Chen's company will pay $3.50 a square foot, or $39,200, while the city will pay Unisys $7.50 a square foot, or $84,000, and absorb the difference.    City economic development officials have been pursuing Mr. Chen in an effort to keep his project in the region. His laboratory at Cray was located near Eau Claire in Chippewa Falls, Wis.    Mr. Chen couldn't be reached for comment, but several senior engineers who worked on the design at Cray also have left the company to join him. City officials said an estimated 40 employees initially will move into the facility.    The company's articles of incorporation, filed in Nevada yesterday, list Mr. Chen and Paul G. Miller, a retired Control Data Corp. executive, as directors. </TEXT></DOC>
