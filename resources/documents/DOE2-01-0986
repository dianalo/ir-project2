Asymmetry of the distribution function along the system axisis observed and investigated on the INAR machine. It was shown that highenergy electrons are created even at large distances ({similar_to}7 m)from the point of REB injection into the plasma (GOL-1). A new machinefor investigating REB interaction with plasma (GOL-M) is described, andthe first experimental results are reported. It is shown that the interactionefficiency increases with the magnetic field strength up to the largestfields obtained in experiments (4.5 T on GOL-M, 7 T on INAR). The practicalresults obtained in generating REB of microsecond duration (3-4 {mu}s)on a plane diode (U-1 machine) is discussed. A beam energy content of130 kJ is obtained. After compression (in a 10 T field) the REB energycontent is 100 kJ. In the final section of the paper, a method is proposedfor increasing the duration and energy content of the beam. 17 refs,8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
