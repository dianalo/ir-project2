Other companies such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.already offer such caller-identification systems, but IBM has anadvantage in the market because of its close ties to potentialcustomers, a consultant said.   Typical customers for such systems are stock brokerages andcompanies that handle ordering and billing over the phone. With thesystem, someone who takes a call simultaneously gets a screen fullof information about the customer's account.   Similarly, a company could list one number in the phone book andthen route calls automatically to the closest office.   In addition to CallPath, IBM also announced at a Dallas tradeshow new controllers that serve as go-betweens for mainframecomputers and desktop terminals.   IBM is so familiar with its customers that it can custom-tailorCallPath to their needs better than other companies can, saidFrancis McInerney, senior analyst at Northern BusinessInformation-Datapro in New York.   IBM's long-range goal is to get a large portion of its revenuefrom helping customers assemble customized information systems,McInerney said. CallPath will help by creating a standard platformto build on, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
