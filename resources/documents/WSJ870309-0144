The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment increased a robust 337,000 last month after a revised 319,000 gain the month before. The department previously said jobs rose by 448,000 in January. Using a measure that counts the military among the employed the rate was unchanged at 6.6% last month.    &quot;This is a good report,&quot; said Robert Wescott, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. &quot;It's a ray of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy set of first-quarter statistics.&quot;    The government has released January data showing severe weakness in orders for factory goods and in retail sales and a swelling of the nation's merchandise trade deficit. It isn't clear, however, to what extent recent figures have been distorted by tax-law changes and by the difficulty of adjusting for seasonal factors in the winter months.    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said, &quot;The employment report was extremely strong, and I think it should lay to rest concerns about the economy that were raised by the weak January statistics.&quot;    Others remained skeptical, however. &quot;The employment figures were stronger than I expected. Other figures have been weaker than expected,&quot; said Francis Schott, chief economist at Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. &quot;In that context I would say that the first half of 1987 is still likely to be only so-so.&quot;    The report showed a sharp rise of 50,000 in manufacturing jobs following a revised drop of 15,000 the month before. The January performance was previously reported as a gain of 3,000. About 31,000 jobs in the latest increase reflected the return of workers after the settlement of labor disputes, mostly at USX Corp., the Pittsburgh-based steel and energy concern. However, average weekly factory hours rose in February to 41.2, the highest level since November 1966, when hours also totaled 41.2. Hours stood at 40.9 the month before.    Construction jobs, which are heavily influenced by weather, rose just 2,000 last month after a gain of 113,000 in January. All the figures are adusted for seasonal variations.    Employment in mining fell again, but only by 2,000, after a 9,000-job drop in January. Overall, employment in goods-producing industries rose 50,000 last month after a rise of 89,000 the month before.    As usual, the strongest jobs gain occurred in the service sector, where employment rose 287,000 after a 230,000 increase in January. Retail trade jobs advanced sharply.    The agency's survey of households, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed that civilian employment rose 371,000 in February after a 374,000 rise the month before. The labor force increased 307,000 in February after a 446,000 rise in January. The department said the labor force has increased by 2.2 million in the past year, with adult women accounting for nearly three of every five new members.    In congressional testimony, Janet Norwood, commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that blacks have entered the labor force at almost twice the rate of whites in the past year. Hispanics, who represent about 7% of U.S. workers, accounted for about 23% of the overall rise in employment in the past year.    The proportion of the civilian population that is employed reached a record 61.2% last month; the increase was concentrated among married women.    Mrs. Norwood also noted with &quot;some concern&quot; that the number of people working part-time because they couldn't find full-time work rose to 5.8 million in February, almost 300,000 above a year earlier.    The average workweek for non-farm workers rose to 35 hours in February from 34.8 in January. Factory overtime hours were unchanged at 3.6 a week despite the rise in average weekly hours.    Average hourly earnings rose to $8.87 from $8.83. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, increased to 171.4% of its 1977 average from 170.6%.
