Congress.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lawmakers Eye Ethics Proposals but Still Hold BackandM;With only a few months left in this session of Congress, lawmakers and theadministration are cirling around procurement ethics proposals like a lionpride preparing to feast on its kill.andP;  all are hungry, but they are wary thatother predators might steal their bounty.andM;Because of this wariness, a decision on how much oversight federalprocurements require seems unlikely in the near future.andM;Late last month, Sen.andP;  William V. Roth (R-Del.) introduced an administrationbill, S 2775, but he did not back the proposal wholeheartedly.andP;  He said hewants to study the effects of the proposed changes.andM;&quot;The administration's proposal is a good starting point and will permit theSenate to proceed with the debate and negotiations that are necessary toreaching a consensus on reforming procurement integrity statutes,&quot; Both said.andM;The latest administration proposal would drop many of the currentrequirements but would retain more controls than earlier administrationproposals.andP;  Sen.andP;  John Glenn (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate GovernmentalAffairs Committee, said the latest proposal would weaken the existing law butappears more workable than former administration ethics packages.andM;Procurement ethics and integrity erupted into a political brouhaha last year.andO;In November, Congress agreed to suspend the current ethics standards in adeal with the administration.andP;  Congress exchanged a one-year suspension ofthe ethics statutes for President Bush's promise he would not veto pay raiselegislation.andM;Initially, the administration had sought a complete repeal of the existingprocurement ethics laws.andP;  But the congressional uproar blocked that plan.andM;The latest administration proposal would remove from the procurementintegrity laws the revolving door restrictions, post-employment limitationson contracting officials, the gratuity restrictions and contractorcertification requirements.andM;Administration officials said all these items are covered by existing generalconduct regulations and procurement officials should not be subjected to a&quot;more onerous standard.&quot;andM;But Glenn said Congress cannot assume all these items will be addressed byother regulations because this assumption hinges on a handful of draftconduct standards the administration has been reviewing since February.andP;  Theadministration has not released these drafts, he said.andM;&quot;The Congress of the United States cannot accept the promise ofadministrative standards it has not seen, he said.andM;Democrats in both the House and Senate have argued that squelching theprocurement ethics requirements would lead to questionable contractingpractices in agencies and could lead to the inappropriate handling ofproprietary and procurement-specific information.andM;On this front, the administration has made some concessions.andP;  Though theadministration's proposal rejects several requirements &quot;it does take theposition that legislation regarding the lease of procurement-sensitiveinformation is needed,&quot; Roth said.andP;  The bill would provide civil and criminalpenalties for disclosing or obtaining source selection information orproprietary bid information.andM;&quot;By focusing on the information tob e protected, rather than the status ofthe individuals who might disclose or obtain the information, or the stage ofa federal agency procurement when the information may be generated, the actwill increase the general understanding of the conduct expected andlimitations imposed,&quot; the bill said.andM;Glenn needled Bush administration officials, saying it took them eight monthsto embrace the existing law's conclusion.andP;  The proposal shows theadministration agrees procurement information must be protected by law, hesaid.andM;Although the ethics debate is more fuel for the partisan rift between himselfand Roth, the committee's ranking minority member, Glenn said, &quot;I believe theproposal is a serious attempt to bridge the gap of disagreement.&quot;andM;The Senate is at the vanguard of the debate.andP;  The new administration proposalhas received less attention in the House.andM;When Congress temporarily axed the standards last year, Rep.andP;  John ConyersJr.andP;  (D-Mich.) erupted and vowed his House Government Operations Committeewould seek remedial action.andP;  While the committee took up several procurmentplans, it produced no ethics package.andM;As vendors and agency officials awaited the debate's outcome, someprocurement experts said the administration's proposal would eliminatefederal employees' fears about not being able to accept private sector jobsin their chosen fields.andM;Patricia A. Szervo, former commissioner of the General ServicesAdministration's IRM Service and an attorney with the Washington firm ofPettit andamp; Martin, said the proposal shows that the administration heard lastyear's complaints about unclear language and a lack of guidance.andM;&quot;It talks specifically about the information and the documents, and if youmess around with the documents you're in trouble,&quot; Szervo said.andP;  &quot;It takesout the restrictions on getting a job after serving in government.andP;  It reallydoes show that the administration tried.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
