The Mountain View, Calif., maker of software used indesigning computer circuitry rose 13 1/2 points to 31 1/2,surging from an $18 offering price that was already higherthan the expected range of $13 to $15 a share.</LP><TEXT>   Elsewhere, over-the-counter stocks erased three days oflosses as the Nasdaq Composite Index soared 11.00 to 632.40,a 1.77% gain. Advancers outpaced decliners, 1,375 to 765, as119 stocks climbed to new highs and 15 fell to new lows.Total OTC volume climbed to 225 million shares from 194.5million Tuesday.   Demand for Synopsys's small offeringjust two millionshares were sold -- was so heavy that the stock opened at$28.50, or $10.50 above the price of the offering, led byMorgan Stanley. It jumped as high as $33 in frenetic tradingas &quot;flippers&quot; -- investors who buy a hot deal and thenimmediately sell it for a quick profit -- turned over theirshares.   Seasoned traders were dazed by the deal's gravity-defyingrise. &quot;This is stupid, stupid, stupid,&quot; one trader said, ashe sold the stock short for his firm's own account --borrowing stock to sell in the expectation that it will falland he will profit by replacing his borrowed shares at alower price. With 12.5 million shares outstanding after theoffering, Synopsys has a market value of nearly $394 million.Insiders, including Sumitomo Corp. of Japan and Harris Corp.of Melbourne, Fla., sold about 450,000 shares. After theoffering, directors and officers own about 38.1% of thestock, venture capital partnerships own 33.5% and Harris hasabout 10.7%.   Synopsys stock will disappoint investors who buy at theselofty levels, many analysts contend. It has been &quot;one ofSilicon Valley's hottest companies for years,&quot; Michael Murphyof the California Technology Stock Letter wrote in a recentreport. Founded in 1986, Synopsys makes a new type ofsoftware for computer engineers that makes it easier andfaster for them to design complex computer chips. Thecompany's &quot;high level design automation software&quot; couldbecome the leading technology in the 1990s for computer-aidedengineering, says Standard andamp; Poor's analyst Robert S. Natale.   Synopsys has snared 250 customers in the semiconductor,computer, communications and defense industries and itsgrowth is expected to be impressive. Revenue is expected tojump nearly 47% to $59.5 million for fiscal 1992, ending inSeptember, from $40.5 million a year earlier, Mr. Nataleestimates. Earnings, depressed in 1991 because ofacquisition-related expenses, are expected to more thandouble to 55 cents a share from 27 cents a year earlier.   Such growth can't be sustained indefinitely, warns CharlesFoundyller, president of Daratech Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.,which tracks the computer-aided design business and expectsthat total sales for all companies in the group will growabout 13% this year to about $540 million. Synopsys &quot;may haverapid growth for a couple of years, but I think they'll hit abrick wall at {sales of} about $100 million,&quot; he says, notingthat the engineering market is limited and that newcompetitors can quickly arrive on the scene.   After yesterday's spectacular debut, Synopsys sells atsky-high levels compared with its more seasoned competitors,Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics, and even isricher than newly public Viewlogic Systems. Synopsys nowtrades at about 8.7 times the most recent 12 months' revenue,compared with Viewlogic, which trades at about six timessales, and Cadence Design and Mentor Graphics, which sell atless than three times revenue. Mr. Murphy suggests waiting tobuy the stock below $20. If stocks cool, Standard andamp; Poor'sMr. Natale suggests that investors wait and buy Synopsys in150 days, after some 9.2 million shares held by insidersbecome available for sale. &quot;Whatever gains the companyexpects to make in the near term have already been reflectedin the stock,&quot; he says.   The fevered reception for Synopsys is likely to feedinterest in computer-related IPOs and replace the thirst forbiotechnology and health-care issues, Mr. Natale adds.Indeed, among more than 35 companies that have gone publicthis month, computer-related IPOs have generally faredbetter, according to IDD Information Services. DefenseSoftware andamp; Systems is up more than 96%, for example, whileFrame Technology is up more than 60%. Even Scholastic, whichis up 21% from Tuesday's offering, has a technologycomponent: it makes educational software as well as printedmaterials.   Yet health care issues have been disappointing: I-Stat, amaker of blood analysis products, also went public yesterdaywith an offering of three million shares. Priced at $18.50 ashare, the stock slipped to $18.25. Advantage Health, whichprovides medical rehabilitation services, has fallen 5.7%from its recent offering price and Univax Biologics, whichwent public early this month at $12 a share, has sagged to$10.25.   Shares of software leader Microsoft jumped 6 1/4 to 122after this newspaper reported that the company is pursuing analliance with Digital Equipment that would allow Microsoft'soperating system software to work on advanced computerworkstations. Separately, Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette analystScott Smith upgraded his rating on Microsoft to &quot;buy&quot; from&quot;moderately attractive.&quot;   Among the day's other sharp gainers were: Medical CareInternational, which climbed 5 1/2 to 71; Chiron, which rose3 1/4 to 53 3/4; Apple Computer, which gained 1 3/8 to 697/8; and U.S. Homecare, which advanced 3 to 24 1/2.   Everex Systems shares jumped 1 7/16 to 7 7/16 after thepersonal computer maker late Tuesday reported net income of$1.2 million, or five cents a share, for its second quarter,ended Feb. 2, reversing a year-ago loss of $15.4 million, or65 cents a share. That loss included $11.4 million incharges.   Several analysts upgraded ratings on Everex's shares.Oppenheimer andamp; Co.'s Marianne Wolk, for example, upgraded heropinion to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;market performer,&quot; Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report said. The latest quarter'searnings were in line with estimates.   Autotrol Corp. slumped 5 1/4 to 9 1/2. Late Tuesday, thecompany disclosed that talks related to its plannedacquisition by Wicor Inc. have been terminated. The companieshad entered an agreement in principle for the transaction inDecember. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Wicorshares added 1/2 to 25 7/8.   Cerner Corp. jumped 4 1/2 to 30 3/4 after the companyreported sharply higher fourth-quarter net income. Revenue atthe Kansas City, Mo., maker of information systems increasedto $27.2 million from $15.1 million.   Amgen advanced 3 1/8 to 66 5/8 amid the general advance inbiotechnology-related stocks. Late Tuesday, Amgen said itwill repurchase as much as $50 million in it common stockthrough next January. It will use the shares for its employeestock-purchase and stock-option plans.
