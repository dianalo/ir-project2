Even without therestraints, exports to the U.S. won't exceed 2.3 millionbecause Japanese makers are increasing local production inthe U.S., the analysts say. In fact, Japan's car exports tothe U.S. in the year ending March 31 are expected to fallbelow the quota for the fourth consecutive year, reflectingthe increased local supply.   Even so, Japanese analysts say ending the restraints couldhave heightened trade tensions. Takashi Sawada, an analyst atNikko Research Center, says &quot;If Japan lifts the quota, someU.S. congressmen may use it as an excuse to attack Japan.&quot; Hebelieves the decision is meant to avoid giving any excuse forthe U.S. to blame Japan for the plight of U.S. auto makershit hard by the ongoing recession.   Mr. Sawada says Japan's car exports to the U.S. are likelyto come down further this year because of a progress in localproduction. However, combined with locally produced cars,Japanese makers are expected to boost their market sharefurther. They raised their combined car market share in theU.S. last year to 29%, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, amajor national economic daily.   In the eight months ended Nov. 30, Japan's car shipmentsto the U.S. totaled 1,196,000 units, down 7.8% from a yearearlier, according to the Japan Automobile ManufacturersAssociation.   The voluntary restraint was put into effect in 1981 in anattempt to help troubled U.S. auto makers turn around. Thequota was first set at 1,680,000 but has been increased sincethen. The current 2.3 million unit quota was set in 1987.   Meanwhile, Mr. Sawada says Japan's total automobileexports -- including trucks -- to the U.S. in 1991 areexpected to total 1.8 million units, down 14.3% from theestimate for 1990. He says last year's shipments are expectedto have totaled 2.1 million, down 11.8% from a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
