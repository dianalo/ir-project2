Over the last two decades, traditional radiology hasevolved into two distinct specialties: diagnostic radiology (imaging)and radiation oncology (therapy). Diagnostic radiology more properlyshould be termed diagnostic imaging, since it encompasses classic X-raystudies, computed tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),diagnostic ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and vascular studies. Radiationoncology, on the other hand, is a therapeutic modality employing ionizingradiation coupled with chemotherapy, surgery, hyperthermia, and othertechniques to treat a wide variety of malignant neoplasms and nonmalignantdiseases. Both specialties employ computers for specific medical applications,diagnostic and therapeutic, and also for nonclinical purposes, includingdepartmental patient flow statistics, scheduling, reporting, billing,research, and economic planning.</TEXT></DOC>
