<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-0142 </DOCNO><TEXT>The need for high performance A/D converters, the advantages of optics,and current approaches to A/D conversion are reviewed. A novel methodis proposed that uses comparators, optical logic, and a table look-upto provide optical digital output from an optical analog input. The advantageof the new method is the ability to produce any digital code, opticalinput/output, and longer work lengths at high speed. Implementationsof the optical logic are proposed that use 1-D SLM devices under development.The optical A/D could make digital multiplication by analog convolutioncompetitive with electronic systems. 13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
