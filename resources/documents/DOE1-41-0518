However, there is a small area of southern Illinois wherea porous, friable white chert rock is found that is very different inphysical form from quartz sand. This microcrystalline material, commonlyreferred to as tripoli, is more easily ground to micron sizes than sand.Although of similar Moh's hardness, microcrystalline tripoli is lessabrasive than either ground quartz sand or many synthetic abrasives.</TEXT></DOC>
