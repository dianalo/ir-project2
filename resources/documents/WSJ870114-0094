The plan drew sharp opposition from HMOs. Under the proposal, employers couldn't eliminate payments to HMOs -- but without specific guidelines, payments to HMOs could vary widely.    &quot;The only way to defeat this proposal is to stimulate a vocal and broad-based campaign against it and urge support of an alternative that assures HMOs equitable treatment by employers,&quot; said Mark Joffe, associate counsel of Group Health Association of America, an HMO trade group.    The rule was intended to stimulate the growth of HMOs, which government officials consider a more cost-effective method of providing health care. Federal officials are continuing to require companies to offer HMO services along with regular health insurance protection. HMO officials fear, however, that the rule would be meaningless if companies decide to lower their contributions to the point where employees must pay so much that HMOs are no longer an attractive alternative.    William Roper, administrator of the federal Health Care Financing Administration, said HMOs no longer need the &quot;special protection&quot; of the federal government. &quot;HMOs are a very important part of the health care delivery system,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;They can stand on their own two feet.&quot;    The proposed rule change would allow an employer and an HMO to reach pricing agreements based on the actual cost of providing service, he said.    Organized labor likely will join HMOs in the fight against the proposal. Burt Seidman, director of occupational safety, health and social security for the AFL-CIO, said the proposal could lead to workers paying more for HMO services or to HMOs cutting services. It also would eliminate the concept of &quot;dual choice on an even basis&quot; that the federal government has been promoting, he added.    The business community sought the rule change because it will save money, said Willis Goldbeck, president of Washington Business Group on Health. Employers feel they pay HMOs more than they should because HMOs, with a generally younger and healthier clientele, have lower costs per patient than regular health programs. </TEXT></DOC>
