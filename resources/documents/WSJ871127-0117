It is a computer graphic rendering of a protein similar to one found in the deadly AIDS virus.    Next, a smaller, green blob moves in and nestles into the hollow curve of the protein like an asymmetrical lock and key. If this were a real biochemical encounter, instead of a computer simulation, the AIDS virus protein might be blocked, and the AIDS virus itself rendered harmless.    &quot;We want to find a molecule that will fit the bumps and grooves (of the viral protein) like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle,&quot; says Renee Des Jarlais, a graduate student in pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California at San Francisco, as she puts the big Evans andamp; Sutherland Computer Corp. scientific computer through its paces. &quot;The goal is to make the most specific blocker possible,&quot; she says, not only in terms of its shape, but also its chemical attraction to the target. &quot;Otherwise, it might interact with things your body needs to work, instead of with the virus, and thus create a toxic reaction.&quot;    The term &quot;computer-aided design&quot; usually conjures up a vision of electronic engineers devising a new microchip on a computerized drawing board. But CAD has come to biomedical research, too. This is how some scientists are conducting the search for the drugs and vaccines of the future, using computers to help them &quot;see&quot; the enemy better, find targets of opportunity, and design potent new weapons to treat and even to prevent acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    UCSF ISN'T ALONE in its interest. The National Institutes of Health, in what may be the first concerted effort to apply these new techniques of drug design to battling an epidemic, just awarded about $25 million over five years to UCSF and five other institutions: Yale, Harvard, the University of California at Los Angeles, SmithKline Corp. and Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc.    George Kenyon, chairman of pharmaceutical chemistry at UCSF, says the project inaugurates a new era in drug design. It's a far cry from current techniques, which often involve searching the world for naturally derived drugs in such diverse sources as deep-sea sponges or South American tree bark.    Prof. Kenyon, who holds a doctorate in chemistry, has assembled a team that first will manufacture a lot of AIDS virus protein using techniques of gene splicing. Then his team will bombard the protein with X-rays to determine its structure. Once this is known, researchers can model the structure of the protein on the computer screen and tailor so-called inhibitors -- that is, molecules that latch on to the virus and incapacitate it.    THE FIRST TARGET on the virus that the Kenyon team will try to attack will be ribonuclease &quot;H&quot; -- which is an enzyme believed to be crucial to the life cycle of the AIDS virus.    The professor warns that the venture probably will take 10 years to synthesize, refine and test its custom-made molecules. But if the techniques work, he feels confident that the tools of computer-aided drug design &quot;can be used against other viruses that come along to plague mankind.&quot;    Some scientists use computers differently in vaccine design. Instead of picturing particles to knock out the virus in a person already infected, they might use the computer to predict how best to rally the body's immune defenses to fight off an invasion by the AIDS virus and prevent disease.    Jay A. Berzofsky, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues including Charles DeLisi, chairman of the Department of Biomathematical Sciences at Mount Sinai in New York, have published a number of papers on using computers to predict which protein fragments on the AIDS virus might be the most capable of sparking an immune response that could protect the body against contracting AIDS.    DR. BERZOFSKY has a notion that the protein fragments most likely to succeed in sparking such an immune response would be those that fold up into a helix, or corkscrew shape, with alternating oily and watery segments. This notion was statistically validated by computer analysis of a large number of protein fragments known to activate immunity. Since certain immunologically potent proteins are built this way, he reasoned that the corkscrew-shaped protein fragments on the AIDS virus, in combination with certain other proteins called MHC antigens -- best known for their role in &quot;transplant rejection&quot; -- would more readily activate the host's T-cells, which act as a group of immune sentries.    So Dr. Berzofsky asked the computer to predict mathematically the areas on the virus where protein fragments might fold up into these corkscrews. Next, the researchers vaccinated mice with synthetic, non-infectious versions of these corkscrews and were able to spark both an increase in the number of T-cells and their immune powers so that the cells were later able to rally against the outer coat of the real virus in a test tube. More experiments are planned to look for a similar increase in the killer cells thought necessary to wipe out the AIDS virus.    But Dr. Berzofsky, too, cautions that this may be a 10-year endeavor. &quot;The computer analysis doesn't take long,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the experiments that take time . . . . Eventually, you'll look at a model where you can test for protection (against the AIDS virus) -- in chimpanzees and, eventually, in people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
