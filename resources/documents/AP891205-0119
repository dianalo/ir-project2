(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In this season of conspicuousconsumption, gourmets and gluttons alike can load up at a grocerystore that offers patrons the use of brass carts and cellulartelephones and plays live classical music.   Customers at FJ's Blackhawk Market, a year-old,33,000-square-foot store, also can sip on fresh-brewed French roastcoffee served from gleaming brass urns while they shop.   There's no Muzak here. Shoppers stroll downblack-and-white-tiled, softly lit aisles to strains of classicalmusic, played by a tuxedoed musician at the keyboard of a shinyblack grand piano.   FJ's operations manager Greg Pereira likes to watch newcustomers do double-takes as they enter the store. He says itborrows a little from other luxury markets while adding his ownwhimsical spin.   The son of a grocery store owner, Pereira owned several chainmarkets before embarking on the upscale showplace about 30 mileseast of San Francisco, near the exclusive Blackhawk Country Club,home to numerous Bay area sports stars, executives andpersonalities.   FJ's was the first store to start up at a shopping complex inthe foothills of majestic Mount Diablo, amid a burgeoning suburbanpopulation with a median household income of $90,000 and an averageage of 38.   He and store owner Frank J. Straface teamed up to create theirown Blackhawk version of Beyerly's in Minnesota, Simon David's inDallas, AJ's in Scottsdale, Ariz. and Harrod's in London.   ``We were laughed at. We were ridiculed by the industry. Wedidn't know if we couldn't do it,'' Pereira recalled.   But they went ahead, doing away with the traditional fluorescentlights that shine overhead in other supermarkets, and installingblack cases and shelves for eye-catching displays of all productsbut produce and meat. State laws ban black shelves for those twoitems.   Shoppers focusing on food can find the usual peanut butter,salami, chips, breakfast flakes and cat food. But it's the unusualthat sets FJ's apart from the usual mall market.   FJ's boasts almost 70 kinds of mustard, ranging in price from 70cents to $10. There is maple syrup from Vermont, cranberry cabernetchutney, wild mushroom caviar, squid ink pasta and bags ofgrapevine cuttings to impart an unusual flavor to Californiabarbeques.   ``What do I like about FJ's?'' said shopper Pat Devine ofBlackhawk. ``Everything. The people are friendly. The place isclean. The carts work.''   So do the cellular phones you can check out while shopping.Local calls are free; long-distance calls can be charged tocustomer credit cards. Periera said the idea was more novel thanpractical at first, and callers tended to boast to friends,``You'll never guess where I'm calling from!''   But he said the dozen phones are more often used now to checkwith someone at home about food purchases _ although they have beenused to complete a car purchase and conclude stock deals.Capitalizing on the communications boon, FJ's also accepts ordersvia fax machines.   Everything is done in the spirit of fun, said Pereira, such asan event dubbed ``Dog Days of Summer.'' During that promotion, thestore offered samples of a frozen canine treat called ``FrostyPaws,'' along with FJ's own version of ``Thirsty Pup'' bottledspring water.   The extras don't jack up the cost of the inventory, Pereirasaid. The fixtures and the shopping carts cost FJs the same as theywould other stores, but FJs tailors them to the upscale market.   For instance, they buy fewer carts that look nicer, he said.   ``It doesn't cost anything,'' Pereira said. ``There is no pricevalue to it. It's just a different approach.''   Focusing on speciality items does bring the store more profit,he acknowledged.   For example, he noted that most stores don't carry ninevarieties of caviar, or carry champagne that ranges in price from$3 to $1,000 a bottle. Ten percent profit on a $1,000 bottle ismuch more than on a $3 bottle of the bubbly, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
