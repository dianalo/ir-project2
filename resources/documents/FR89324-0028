The Notice of Hearingcontained amendment proposals submitted by the Raisin Administrative Committee(Committee), which locally administers the order. Those proposals pertainedto changing the Raisin Diversion Program (RDP), nomination procedures forindependent producer representatives on the Committee, expenses for alternateCommittee representatives, reserve pool procedures, and handler compliancewith the marketing order. Mr. John D. Pakchoian, former chairman of theCommittee, submitted a proposal which would have required that independentproducer representatives not have an interest in handler operations. Thenotice also included three proposals by the Fruit and Vegetable Division,Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department),to limit Committee tenure, add authority for continuance referenda, andprovide authority to make any necessary conforming changes.Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof,the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), on July21, 1987, filed with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture,a Recommended Decision containing a notice of the opportunity to file writtenexceptions thereto by August 29, 1988. Exceptions were received from Mr.Clyde E. Nef, Manager of the Committee, Ms. Karen Larsen, Program Directorof the California Farm Bureau Federation, and Mr. Barry F. Kriebel, Presidentof Sun-Maid Growers of California. The exceptions to the Recommended Decisionare discussed in detail and ruled upon in this document.In accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)(5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined by theSmall Business Administration (SBA) (13 CFR 121.3) as those having averageannual gross revenues for the last three years of less than $500,000. Smallagricultural service firms, which includes handlers under the marketingagreement and order, are defined as those with gross annual revenues ofless than $3,500,000.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Interested persons were invited to presentevidence at the hearing on the probable regulatory and informational impactof the proposed rule on small businesses. The record indicates that most,if not all, handlers regulated under this program would meet the SBA definitionof small agricultural service firms. Maketing orders and rules issued thereunderare unique in that they are normally brought about through group actionof essentially small entities for their own benefit. Thus, both the RFAand the Act are compatible with respect to small entities.It is estimated that approximately 23 handlers of California raisins areregulated under Marketing Order No. 989. Almost all of the handlers ofCalifornia raisins would be classified as small entities. Since handlerscovered under Marketing Order No. 989 are predominately small businesses,the order itself is tailored to the size and nature of these small businesses.In addition, there are about 5,000 producers of raisins. The majority ofCalifornia raisin producers would also be classified as small entities.The proposed amendment to the marketing agreement and order includes aprovision pertaining to a production cap of 2.75 tons per acre for productionunits approved for participation in the Raisin Diversion Program (RDP).The RDP gives producers the means of voluntarily reducing the quantityof grapes grown for drying into raisins while receiving the equivalentquantity of raisins, represented on diversion certificates issued to theproducers by the Committee, to sell to handlers as though the raisins wereproduced in the current crop year. The producer receives raisins from theprevious year's reserve pool in an amount of equal to the acreage removedor diverted under the RDP multiplied by the producer's previous year'sproduction in tons per acre. This amount is represented on the diversioncertificate. The production cap is designed to prevent producers applyingto participate in the RDP from reporting greater than actual raisin production.Since the RDP is a voluntary program, no producer is required to participate.If a producer historically produces above the production cap, such producercould choose to produce a crop rather than participate in the RDP. Thischange would not adversely affect small entities.The proposed changes to allow reconditioned raisins in the reserve poolsand establish an average maturity quality level that reserve raisins mustmeet when delivered to the Committee are intended to improve the qualityof reserve pool raisins and thus improve producers' returns on their equity.This change would not adversely affect small entities.The proposed change that would require the Committee to reimburse alternateCommittee members their necessary expenses for attending Committee meetingsis anticipated to have a positive effect on producers and handlers by increasingthe level of expertise of Committee members. This additional expense wouldbe offset by assessments on handlers. Program operations benefit all handlersand producers and it is thus appropriate to provide a minimum level ofcompensation to alternate members, who serve in the industry's generalinterest. The change would have no adverse affect on small entities.The proposal to add a late payment and interest charge for handlers whodefault on reverve pool sales would encourage prompt payment by handlersand discourage such defaults. Handlers would be required to pay such chargesonly if they are late in paying the Committee for raisins released to themfrom the reserve pool. In addition, prompt payment by handlers would ensuremore timely payments to producers who have equity in the reserve pools.This change would not adversely affect small entities. The proposals pertaining to operations of the Committee (tenure and periodicreferenda) would provide more frequent opportunity for producer votingon continuance of the marketing order, and an opportunity for broader basedrepresentation on the Committee. The change proposing that nominationsfor independent producer positions on the Committee be held by mail shouldincrease independent producer participation in the nomination process.These changes would not adversely affect small entities. All these changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioningof the marketing agreement and order and would not have a significant economicimpact on small businesses. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter35), the changes in the recordkeeping and reporting provisions that areincluded in the proposed amendments to the order will be submitted forapproval to the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. These changes arethe addition of a mail ballot for the purposes of nominating independentproducers and producers affiliated with cooperative marketing organizationshandling less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during thepreceding crop year to the Committee and the optional preparation of briefstatements that nominees could submit to the Committee describing theirqualifications to serve on the Committee. These forms could not be usedprior to OMB approval. <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions and Rulings on Exceptions </ITAG>Discussions and rulings included in the discussions of the material issues,findings, and general findings of the Recommended Decision set forth inthe July 28, 1988, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 28405) are hereby approved and adoptedsubject to the following modifications and corrections:Based upon the exception filed by Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusionsin material issue number 1 of the Recommended Decision, concerning whethera mail balloting procedure should be established for filling independentproducer member positions on the Committee, are amended by adding the followingparagraph after the fifth paragraph of material issue number 1 to readas follows: The exception received from Mr. Nef indicated that for the purposes ofconducting the mail balloting process, producers affiliated with cooperativemarketing organizations handling less than 10 percent of the total raisinacquisitions during the preceding crop year should be combined with theindependent producer category. By combining the two categories togetherthe mail balloting process would be easier to administer and would savethe Committee time and money. Mr. Nef indicated that the Recommended Decisionstated that producers affiliated with cooperative marketing organizationsbe nominated by the same balloting procedure as proposed for independentproducers. Mr. Nef indicated that this language could be interpreted asproviding separate nominations for independent producers and producersaffiliated with cooperative maketing associations handling less than 10percent of total raisin acquisitions. However, the discussion and languagein the Recommended Decision concerning adopting mail balloting proceduresfor such producers affiliated with cooperative marketing associations wasnot intended to provide for a separate procedure. Since it was the proponent'sintention to combine these two categories together and it is consistentwith the hearing record, this exception is adopted to clarify the RecommendedDecision. However, no change to the proposed order language is necessary.Based upon the exception filed by Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusionsin material issue number 3 of the Recommended Decision, concerning whethera production cap of 2.75 tons per acre for those producers who apply forparticipation in the RDP should be implemented, are amended by adding thefollowing paragraph after the third paragraph of material issue number3 to read as follows:The exception received from Mr. Nef objected to the phrase in the RecommendedDecision that ``producers could inflate their acreage by acquiring raisinsfrom another source * * *''. Mr. Nef explained that producers' acreagecannot be inflated since all RDP acreage is verified by Committee staff.Therefore, the reference to ``acreage'' should be changed to ``production''.Mr. Nef's comment has been adopted as a clarification to the RecommendedDecision.Based upon the exception of Mr. Nef and the exception of Mr. Kriebel, thefindings and conclusions in material issue number 4 of the RecommendedDecision, concerning whether handlers should be permitted to set asidereconditioned raisins to satisfy their reserve pool obligations and whetherreserve pool raisins should meet an average maturity level, are amendedby adding the following three paragraphs after the fifth paragraph of materialissue number 4 to read as follows:The exception from Mr. Nef stated that while the statement, ``could deliverpacked raisins to the Committee'' is technically correct, this statementshould not be interpreted as giving the handler the option of deliveringpacked raisins or natural condition raisins. Mr. Nef explained that asthe order has been interpreted, that statement gives the option to theCommittee as to whether the handler delivers natural condition or packedraisins to the Committee. This view is consistent with the language ofandSection; 989.66(b)(4) of the order. Therefore, the clarification of theRecommended Decision as contained in the exception is adopted.An exception received from Mr. Barry Kriebel opposed the amendment thatwould allow handelrs to set aside reconditioned raisins to satisfy theirreserve pool obligations. Mr. Kriebel stated that if reconditioned raisinsare allowed to be placed in and stored in the reserve pool for extendedperiods of time, the quality and integrity of the reserve pool could sufferand eventually result in economic loss to the producers (equity holdersof reserve raisins). Mr. Kriebel further asserted that the proposal wouldallow an economic windfall to those handlers who would be able to substituteless valuable reconditioned raisins into the reserve pool for more valuableraisins with bloom remaining.Testimony presented at the hearing supported this amendment proposal andindicated that handlers would be required to deliver natural conditionraisins to the Committee, if requested. Therefore, receiving handlers wouldbe assured of the quality of the raisins they would be receiving for reservepool sales. It was also testified that due to the superior storabilityof non-reconditioned raisins, most handlers who would place reconditionedraisins into the reserve pools would be likely to remove and process thereconditioned raisins for reserve pool sales prior to utilizing reservenon-reconditioned raisins. Such reconditioned raisins would be utilizedby blending them with better quality raisins in order to bring the levelof quality of the packed raisins up to consumer standards. In view of thiscomment and to provide separate consideration of this matter, the proposalregarding reconditioned reserve pool raisins has been designated as a separateissue for the purposes of voting in the producer referendum. Otherwise,for the reasons stated above, Mr. Kriebal's exception is denied.Based upon the exception from Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusions inmaterial issue number 4 of the Recommended Decision are further amendedby adding the following two paragraphs after the eighth paragraph of materialissue number 4 to read as follows:The exception filed by Mr. Nef disagreed with the findings that indicatedthat handlers should be required to set aside average incoming maturityraisins to meet their reserve pool obligation. Mr. Nef indicated that itwas the proponent's intent that the average incoming maturity level wouldonly apply to reserve pool raisins that a handler delivered to the Committee.Mr. Nef stated that handlers are not required to set aside raisins equalto their average incoming maturity level to satisfy their reserve poolobligation. However, according to this proposal, the Committee can requirehandlers to deliver natural condition raisins of the average incoming maturitylevel of raisins which such handlers acquired during the applicable cropyear. This would prevent poor quality raisins from being released to theCommittee for sales to other handlers. It is found that Mr. Nef's exceptionmore correctly describes the proposed amendment and, therefore, his commentis adopted for the purpose of clarifying the Recommended Decision. However,no change to the proposed amendment is necessary.Mr. Nef's exception also indicated that handlers chould purchase additionalraisins from other handlers to satisfy a reserve pool sale. As a clarification,Mr. Nef stated that handlers do not purchase reserve pool raisins fromother handlers. Rather, they are purchased from the Committee, which inturn transfers raisins from one handler to another handler. If a handlerbelieves that reserve pool raisins that are lower than the 50 percent GradeB or better maturity requirement have been purchased, such handler canrequest that the raisins be inspected. handlers are required to deliverto the Committee, upon request, reserve pool raisins that meet the minimumincoming grade and condition standards, except for normal and natural deterioration.If the reserve pool raisins fail inspection, they are returned to the transferringhandler who is required to replace them with raisins that meet the minimumgrade standards. The exception has been adopted for the purpose of clarifyingthe Recommended Decision.Based upon the exception filed by Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusionsin material issue number 5 of the Recommended Decision, concerning whetherhandlers should pay an interest and late payment charge if they fail topay for reserve pool raisins purchased from the Committee, are amendedby adding the following paragraph after the fourth paragraph of materialissue number 5 to read as follows:The exception received from Mr. Nef indicated that there is no purchaseagreement between the Committee and a handler which specifies the termsand conditions of reserve pool offers. Mr. Nef stated that the paymentterms are included as part of the terms and conditions of such offers,so that when handlers accept the reserve tonnage offered to them they aresubject to the terms of payment. However, when a handler accepts the termsof an offer the handler is entering into a purchase agreement, therefore,Mr. Nef's exception is denied.Based upon the exception filed by Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusionsin material issue number 7 of the Recommended Decision, concerning whethera six-year tenure limit on Committee members' tenure should be implemented,are amended by adding the following two paragraphs after the sixth paragraphof material issue number 7 to read as follows:The exception received from Mr. Nef asserted that testimony presented atthe hearing indicated that there is a natural turnover which occurs inCommittee representation, therefore, tenure requirements are not necessary.Mr. Nef also suggested an alternative to the proposal that would allowmembers, after serving a six year term, to serve as alternate members thenext term before returning as a member to the Committee. Mr. Nef indicatedthat serving as an alternate member during this period would be beneficialto the individual and the raisin industry. As discussed above and supportedin the hearing testimony, Committee tenure for members improves representationon marketing order committees by allowing for different perspectives andideas and broader-based participation by all members of the regulated communityin the administration of the marketing order. Based upon the hearing record,this is best achieved by limiting the Committee members to a six-year termof office and requiring members to not serve on the Committee for one fullterm as either a member or alternate. Thus, Mr. Nef's exception is denied.Mr. Nef also indicated that this material issue refers to ``proponents''and that this could be confusing since in this issue the ``proponents''are the Department rather than the Committee. However, each material issuehas been numbered, the proponent herein identified, and discussed separately,therefore, no clarification is needed. Thus, Mr. Nef's exception is denied.An exception to material issue number 8 of the Recommended Decision wasfiled by Ms. Karen Larsen of the California Farm Bureau Federation. Basedupon that exception, the findings and conclusions in material issue number8 of the Recommended Decision concerning continuance referenda to be heldevery six years are amended by adding the following paragraph after thesecond paragraph of material issue number 8 to read as follows:An exception received from the California Farm Bureau Federation (CFBF)agreed with the concept of periodic continuance referenda but opposed thepercentage of support required for continuance. The CFBF favors the percentagerequired under a State of California Law which requires a minimum of 40percent of all the producers of a commodity to participate in a producerreferendum for the referendum to be valid. The Federal marketing orderfor California raisins is authorized under the Agricultural Marketing AgreementAct of 1937. As stated above, the results of continuance referenda shouldbe based upon the same percentage of support required in section 8c(8)of the Act with respect to producer approval of the issuance of a marketingorder. Thus, this requirement is appropriate as a measure of producer supportto continue the marketing order. Therefore, the exception is denied.Based upon an exception filed by Mr. Nef, the findings and conclusionsin material issue number 8 of the Recommended Decision, concerning theimplementation of tenure requirements, are further amended by adding thefollowing paragraph after the seventh paragraph of material issue number8 to read as follows:Mr. Nef indicated that this material issue also referred to ``proponents''and that this could be confusing since in this issue the ``proponents''are the Department rather than the Committee. However, each material issuehas been numbered, the proponent herein identified, and discussed separately.Therefore, no clarification is needed. Thus, Mr. Nef's exception is denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Marketing Agreements and Orders</ITAG>Annexed hereto and made part hereof are the documents entitled, ``OrderAmending the Order, As Amended, Regulating the Handling of Raisins ProducedFrom Grapes Grown in California'' and ``Marketing Agreement, As FurtherAmended, Regulating the Handling Of Raisins Produced From Grapes Grownin California.''
