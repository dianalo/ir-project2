<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0786 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of elimination of total conductivity dependence on the oxygenconcentration in gaseous phase and a modified polarization method wereused in the 1273-1473 K temperature range to investigate specimen electricconductivity of section x(0.90 ZrO/sub 2/+0.10 Sc/sub 2/O/sub 3/)+y(oxideaddition), where the oxide addition: Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/, Cr/sub 2/O/sub3/, TiO/sub 2/. Effect of oxide additions on the nature of conductivityof solid electrolyte ZrO/sub 2/+Sc/sub 2/O/sub 3/ in the range of lowpartial oxygen pressures has been determined. Values of electron parameterof solid electrolyte transport have been determined as well.</TEXT></DOC>
