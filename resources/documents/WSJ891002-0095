Avon, which wouldn't give sales figures for Stern, said Stern has marketed Valentino fragrances world-wide under a license from Valentino Perfumes for four years. An Avon spokesman said Stern was a &quot;not very large contributor&quot; to Avon's profit. Avon recently reported first-half net income of $45.7 million, or 51 cents a share, reversing a loss in last year's first half of $55.3 million.    Avon expects the sale to be completed within a month. It said it expects to realize a gain on the sale and that proceeds will be used to reduce debt. </TEXT></DOC>
