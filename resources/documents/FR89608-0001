The marketing agreement and orderare effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, asamended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this final rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 60 handlers of Southeastern potatoes under thismarketing order, and approximately 150 potato producers. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR121.2) as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majorityof the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1989-90 fiscal year was prepared by theSoutheastern Potato Committee (committee), the agency responsible for localadministration of the order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculturefor approval. The members of the committee are handlers and producers ofSoutheastern potatoes. They are familiar with the committee's needs andwith the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area andare thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget wasformulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affectedpersons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the committee was derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of potatoes. Because that rateis applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate whichwill produce sufficient income to pay the committee's expected expenses.The Southeastern Potato Committee met on April 20, 1989, and unanimouslyrecommended a 1989-90 budget of $11,000 and an assessment rate of $0.01per hundredweight. This year's budget and assessment rate are the sameas last year's. Major expense items include committee staff salaries, travelexpenses, and utilities. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipatedfresh market potato shipments of 700,000 hundredweight, would yield $7,000in assessment revenue which, when added to $4,000 from reserve funds, willbe adequate to cover budgeted expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costsare in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offsetby the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore,the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 12, 1989 (54 FR 20604). That documentcontained a proposal to add andSection; 953.246 to authorize expenses andestablish an assessment rate for the Southeastern Potato Committee. Thatrule provided that interested persons could file comments through May 22,1989. No comments were received. It is found that the specified expenses are reasonable and likely to beincurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to coversuch expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. This action should be expedited because the committee needs to have sufficientfunds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The1989-90 fiscal period begins on June 1, 1989, and the marketing order requiresthat the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessablepotatoes handled during the fiscal period. In addition, handlers are awareof this action which was recommended by the committee at a public meeting.Therefore, it is also found that good cause exists for not postponing theeffective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (5 U.S.C. 553). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 953 </ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, potatoes (Virginia and North Carolina).For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 953 is amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 953_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN SOUTHEASTERN STATES </ITAG>1.
