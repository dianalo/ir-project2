The General Services Administration yesterday asked for bids on a 10-year contract to design, equip and operate a state-of-the-art government telecommunications network. The bids are to be submitted by June, and GSA hopes to award the contract, which could yield as much as $4 billion in revenue for the winner, by the end of the year.    The bid announcement had been anticipated by the telecommunications industry for almost a year.The project is the largest procurement program in the GSA's history, according to agency officials.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which holds the current contract for the federal system, has already teamed with a unit of defense contractor Boeing Co. to try to retain it. Another defense contractor, Martin Marietta Corp. of Bethesda, Md., is joining with the seven regional Bell operating companies, MCI Communications Corp. of Washington and a unit of Toronto-based Northern Telecom Ltd. to seek the contract. US Sprint Communications Co., a long-distance telephone company owned jointly by GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo., is also expected to enter the competition.    The new service would replace the federally managed network of owned and leased equipment and leased long-distance telephone lines that link 1.3 million government workers nationwide and handle 300 million calls a year. The system, the world's largest private line network, was developed 24 years ago to take advantage of ATandamp;T's bulk rates.    The current contract generates $450 million in annual revenue for ATandamp;T. The GSA is the only customer to have its own ATandamp;T vice president to attend to it exclusively.    The GSA drafted the 376-page request for bids after consulting with several telecommunications companies. It lists specifications for the system only in terms of the services it would offer, leaving other technical specifications up to the bidders.    The new system, called FTS 2000, is to provide voice, video and high-speed data communications. The current system can send only voice and low-speed data messages. The difference between the old and the new networks will be &quot;the difference between horses and jet planes,&quot; said Bernard Bennington, GSA deputy commissioner for telecommunications services.    The GSA plan calls for the government to begin switching over to the new system in mid-1988 and for the entire network to be in place by the end of 1990.    Boeing Computer Services of Seattle, the Boeing unit working with ATandamp;T, is already under contract to build a telephone and data network for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Boeing would design the GSA-requested system and ATandamp;T would provide the equipment and the long-distance service.    In the Martin Marietta partnership the Bell companies would provide local telephone services and access to the main telephone network. MCI would handle long-distance services and Northern Telecom would provide the necessary equipment.    Under the new system, the government will pay only for the time the telephone lines are used, rather than leasing them full-time, as it now does. Having the vendor rather than the government manage the network would result in further savings, GSA officals said. The officials expect to reduce the system's current annual cost of $505 million by at least $100 million. </TEXT></DOC>
