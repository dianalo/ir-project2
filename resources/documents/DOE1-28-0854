Binding of [{sup 3}H]gibberellin A{sub 1} (GA{sub1}) to a soluble macromolecular component present in the cytosol wasdemonstrated at 4{sup 0}C by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. The bindingcomponent was of high molecular weight (HMW) and greater than 500 kilodaltons.The HMW component was shown to be a protein and the {sup 3}H-activitybound to this protein was largely [{sup 3}H]GA{sub 1} and not a metabolite.Binding was pH sensitive but only a small percentage (20%) appeared tobe exchangeable on addition of unlabeled GA{sub 1}. Both biologicallyactive and inactive GAs and non-GAs were able to inhibit GA{sub 1} binding.[{sup 3}H]GA{sub 1} binding to an intermediate molecular weight (IMW)fraction (40-100 kilodaltons) was also detected, provided cytosol wasfirst desalted using Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Gel filtration studiessuggest that the HMW binding component is an aggregate derived from theIMW fraction. The HMW binding fraction can be separated into two componentsusing anion exchange chromatography.</TEXT></DOC>
