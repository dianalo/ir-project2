The plan, a modified version of an earlier Senate Budget Committee proposal, attempts to meet the many complaints voiced last week by Democrats who aren't members of the panel.    Democratic leaders in the Senate said the modified budget plan is likely to be approved, perhaps as early as today, by at least 51 of the 54 Democrats in the 100-member chamber.    It is doubtful that Republican members will join them. Last year, a similar linking of extra spending to new taxes was rejected by President Reagan, and this one probably would be opposed, too. In addition, the plan must weather amendments on the Senate floor and be reconciled with a somewhat different budget outline passed by the House before it serves as a guideline for later congressional action.    The new budget resolution, which would cover the year beginning Oct. 1, would apportion the government's $1 trillion budget differently than President Reagan proposed and would reduce the projected budget deficit by slightly more than his own budget plan -- roughly $37 billion in fiscal 1988, compared with the president's $36 billion.    The revised Democratic plan would allow military spending to increase with inflation and would reduce projected nonmilitary spending by $8.6 billion. It would raise taxes by $18.3 billion and take in an additional $7.2 billion by refinancing loans from the Rural Electrification Administration.    The new plan's military outlays are $7 billion more than the amount in the committee's plan. The panel's nonmilitary spending would be $10.3 billion less than projected levels. In addition, the committee plan would have increased revenues by $18.5 billion, which included $11.3 billion in tax increases and the $7.2 billion REA loan refinancing plan.    The twist in the Democratic plan is that the $7 billion in additional military spending would be financed directly by new taxes. Moreover, the taxes would be included in the same legislation as the additional outlay. Thus, if the president wanted the $7 billion additional military spending and signed the bill, he at the same time would be approving a tax increase.    The president has said that he wants a sizable increase in military spending, but would oppose a tax increase, though his own budget plan contains a modest one.    The new budget plan also adds money, compared with the budget panel's document, to education and health programs, and also restores about a third of the reductions that were slated in programs that primarily help Western states. These alterations were demanded by Democratic senators last week in exchange for support sufficient to assure passage of the measure.    The strongest complaints were from moderate and conservative Democrats, who thought the military spending figure was too low.    Republicans are considering offering an alternative plan that would contain smaller tax increases and more military spending in fiscal 1988. In addition, at least some amendments are likely to be proposed to the revised plan. </TEXT></DOC>
