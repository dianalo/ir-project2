Mr. Majrooh, who heads anAfghan information center here, has watched one frustratedresistance leader after another throw in the towel. His uncleleft for Germany, his grandfather for the U.S. His activistfather was killed by mujahedeen extremists. What's more, hegrumbles, no one in the West seems to care about Afghanistananymore.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Everyone here is fed up,&quot; says the 40-year-old Afghan.&quot;People are leaving.&quot;   It's easy to see why. This city was once on the front lineof the Cold War. For more than a decade, the Pakistani bordertown of Peshawar served as Afghanistan's &quot;other&quot; capital -- ahospital for the wounded, a listening post for diplomats, atransit point for journalists heading for battles across thenearby border.   Now it's just another anachronistic outpost of yesterday'ssuperpower struggle. Since the Soviet Union withdrew itstroops from Afghanistan and slipped into its own internalchaos, this war has lost the attention of the West. Andthat's left many Afghan exiles here feeling abandoned andbitter.   &quot;The reporters no longer come,&quot; says Azim Nasser-Zia, aresistance political officer who works out of Peshawar andIslamabad, Pakistan's capital. &quot;Now Afghanistan is mentionedin the West only as, `solving the problem ofAfghanistan-Kampuchea-Angola' -- all together, as if they arethe same thing.&quot;   The fighting continues in Afghanistan; only the nature ofit has changed. These days, the wounded mujahedeen in theambulances trundling through the dust are as likely to havebeen shot by rival &quot;freedom fighters&quot; as by soldiers of thecommunist regime in Kabul. Even some aid groups are leaving,worried about their safety as the great &quot;jihad&quot;, or holy war,dissolves further into just another civil war.   Despair is especially evident in the generation of Afghansnow in their 30s and 40s who gave their youth to the causeand would be the backbone of any postwar reconstructioneffort. &quot;The momentum is gone, everybody is worried about hisown future,&quot; says Mr. Nasser-Zia, 42. &quot;If worse comes toworst, I can go to the U.S. But I'm not a young man, theywill think twice about employing me.&quot;   Paradoxically, this war is one most Americans feel was wonlong ago. In today's Realpolitik, the mujahedeen were nevermuch more than proxies in the effort to halt Sovietexpansion. In that, the mujahedeen -- and U.S. policy -- werespectacularly successful. For many Westerners, the real warin Afghanistan ended in 1989, when the last Soviet soldierlimped back across the border into the U.S.S.R.   But tell that to the Afghans. Casualties in the war havecontinued to mount -- albeit more slowly -- to where a totalof 1.5 million now are estimated to have been killed. Morethan three million Afghans still crowd refugee camps inPakistan and an additional one million are in Iran -- out ofa population of only 16 million.   Afghan President Najibullah and his Communist Party stillcontrol Kabul and the Soviets still back him with aid. Stillarrayed against him are myriad political parties, localcommanders and feudal warlords -- some for rent by the hour-- that make up the fractured mujahedeen. But those rebelsstill rarely cooperate: Joint attacks, like one that capturedthe city of Khost this spring, are the exception.   Instead, splits in the mujahedeen have deepened furtheralong ethnic, tribal and geographic lines. &quot;It's sofactionalized, that it's difficult to point to the`resistance leadership' in any relevant way,&quot; says oneWestern diplomat.   An effort to finally resolve the conflict through theUnited Nations is gaining momentum. How far it will get isuncertain. But in the mind of Nawaz Sharif, the primeminister of Pakistan, the road to a resolution is clear. &quot;TheSoviets will have to play the major role,&quot; he says.&quot;Najibullah will have to be removed.&quot;   His is a common refrain. Outside Peshawar, in a swelteringmud and brick refugee camp that's home to 5,000 Afghans,Sahebjan Obaidi stands on a dirt path surrounded by his fivechildren. It has been six years since Mr. Obaidi, 43, fledthe fighting in Afghanistan. Three of his children were bornin the camp and have never seen their country. Still, hesays, &quot;I'm not going back until Najibullah leaves.&quot;   The recent coup attempt in Moscow may make the U.S.S.R.more compromising. When the coup failed, it took somehard-line military leaders down with it, and many of thoseofficers backed the status quo in Afghanistan.   But for the moment, the war is a stalemate, and theAfghans are the wearier for it. In Peshawar, where factionalkillings are commonplace, fear pervades daily life. &quot;The daybefore yesterday, an Afghan thinker was kidnapped,&quot; says Mr.Majrooh, the head of the news center. &quot;That could happen tome any day.&quot;   Mr. Majrooh was in his 20s when he went to war against theKabul regime. He spent time as an artilleryman beforeinheriting the Afghan Information Center from his father, whowas killed after publishing a survey of Afghans thatdisclosed little support for the fundamentalist parties ofthe mujahedeen.   &quot;I found him a few minutes after the attack -- bulletshere, here, here,&quot; says Mr. Majrooh, pointing to his chest.He won't say who he thinks did it. But he has sent his wifeand three children to the U.S. for safety, and, pulling a.32-caliber pistol from a drawer, he says he's carefulhimself.   Though Mr. Majrooh continues to write about the war, fewerand fewer people seem to be listening. His center'sguestbook, which in 1988 listed page after page of foreignvisitors, has only a handful of entries this year. Still, heplans to stay. &quot;I've been in the struggle for 12 years,&quot; hesays. &quot;I can't abandon it now.&quot;   In Islamabad, meanwhile, Mr. NasserZia is pinching penniesat the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, one of theresistance groups. He used to shuttle U.S. congressmen aroundand woo journalists. But since the U.S. and other nationsbegan cutting back aid to the mujahedeen, Mr. Nasser-Zia'sroutine has changed.   &quot;Now I don't even go into the office,&quot; he says. &quot;I spendmy day solving stupid problems, like our electricity was cutoff because we hadn't paid the bill.&quot; His staff of 25 hasshrunk to six.   So Mr. Nasser-Zia talks about the need for a &quot;new phase&quot;in the mujahedeen's struggle, one that will bring thestalemate to an end. There's not much other choice, hesuggests; the &quot;jihad&quot; has run out of steam.   However dissipated that struggle has become, though, somecontend that the war was a turning point in modern times.&quot;The mujahedeen played a critical role in pushing the Sovietsover the edge,&quot; says a veteran diplomat in Peshawar. Theyhumbled the Soviet military and &quot;minimized its ability toimpede &quot;perestroika&quot;. The vast changes in Europe can reallybe traced back to some lonely mujahedeen on a hill with arifle, knocking off a Soviet soldier.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
