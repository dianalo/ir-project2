Most futures exchanges stick to what they know, and it'srare that they become involved in trading the actualcommodities underlying futures contracts. But now, withopportunities for new futures contracts in agricultural goodsand financial instruments seemingly exhausted, the ChicagoBoard of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange arecasting far and wide for new products.</LP><TEXT>   To create a futures market, there first must be anunderlying cash or spot market in the commodity. In anattempt to ensure that a spot market for acid rain emissionallowances develops, the exchanges are likely to proposerunning such a market themselves -- the first such effort inabout a decade.   Running both futures and cash markets &quot;is the wave of thefuture for futures exchanges,&quot; says Michael O'Connell,assistant manager for financial products at the Board ofTrade, which last ran a cash market in the late 1970s in itsgrains sector. Some small exchanges still run limited cashand futures markets, but such arrangements have been confinedto agricultural produce.   The idea of trading emission allowances isn't asfar-fetched as it may seem. Late next year, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency will issue emissionallowances that put a cap on the volume of sulfur dioxideemissions permitted. An innovative feature of the regulatoryprogram is that utility companies will be allowed to tradeallowances that they don't use.   The Board of Trade and the Nymex both are expected topropose to run cash, or spot, trading in the emissionallowances, exchange sources say. The EPA has placed a noticein the Federal Register this week requesting proposals byFeb. 21 for an outside agent to act as the center for tradingin the allowances.   &quot;There's a clear need for an organized spot market&quot; inacid rain emission allowances, says Richard Sandor, executivemanaging director for derivatives at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.and the director of the Board of Trade responsible fordeveloping its emissions futures contract.   Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the allowances will beissued late next year, mostly to utility companies. Say autility is given allowances to emit 5,000 tons of sulfurdioxide, the gas that causes acid rain. If the companyactually emits only 4,000 tons, it will be allowed to sellthe remaining allowances to other utilities that can't meetthe limit set by the EPA for compliance.   The company could sell its allowances at periodic cashmarket auctions, or by selling a futures contract if itexpects to have unused allowances at a later date.   The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest futuresexchange, said in July that it planned to offer futurescontracts on the emission allowances. The exchange will makeits proposal to run the cash market underlying those futuresto the EPA soon, officials say.   Currently, the Nymex says it's interested in running acash market in the emission allowances. A Nymex spokeswomansays it's &quot;looking at both cash and futures&quot; on theallowances, but she says she doesn't yet know whether theexchange will actually submit a proposal to the EPA.   A source close to Nymex, however, says it &quot;has a veryambitious game plan and is very serious&quot; about a cash marketfor emission allowances. Nymex already has a large energycomplex, including heating oil futures, which makes thesulfur dioxide emissions &quot;a good fit,&quot; he says.   Nymex also expects more &quot;green&quot; futures contracts to bemarketed in years to come. &quot;Running the acid rain contractswould give a competitive edge for other emissions marketsthat might develop,&quot; the source says.   Although submissions must be made to the EPA by February,agency officials say they don't know when they'll make adecision on who should run the emissions market.   The EPA considered running the cash market for sulfurdioxide emissions itself, says Paul Horwitz, chief of theEPA's acid rain policy branch in Washington. But &quot;that reallyisn't something the EPA should be doing,&quot; he says.   Alice LeBlanc, staff economist at the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, a lobbying group, says the EPA is right to farmout the emissions market to a private entity, as it isallowed to do under the Clean Air Act. &quot;I think it's greatthat a private group like the Board of Trade is going to take. . . the administrative burden off the EPA,&quot; LeBlanc says.   The Clean Air Act orders the 110 biggest-polluting powerplants to reduce total sulfur dioxide emissions by 60% from1980 levels by 1995. The second phase of the Act requires 800lesser polluters to cut emissions to less than half their1980 levels by the year 2000.   Utilities weren't keen to see the EPA in charge of tradingthe emission rights. &quot;We were uncomfortable with having anenvironmental agency be responsible for utility assets,&quot; saysSteven Jenkins, manager of federal affairs at Tampa ElectricCo., a unit of Teco Energy Co. in Tampa, Fla. &quot;They do nothave the financial expertise.&quot;   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington,which will regulate the futures market for emissionallowances, says the agency can't complete the procedure forapproving the Board of Trade's clean air futures until theEPA has decided who will run the underlying cash market.   &quot;It helps to know how the cash market will operate, so wecan determine if the terms of the futures contract track thecash market adequately,&quot; says a CFTC spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
