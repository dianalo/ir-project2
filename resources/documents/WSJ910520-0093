The move by Sony Medical Electronics, a division of theJapanese consumer electronics company, is the latest step inSony's five-year plan to build its medical electronicsbusiness and develop new applications for some of its maturevideo technologies.</LP><TEXT>   One product is a remote video surgical consultationsystem, which allows surgeons in an operating room to viewinformation transmitted from a remote laboratory. Forinstance, a surgeon can take a tissue sample from a patientin the operating room, send the sample to a laboratory, and amicroscope with a video camera attached would send imagesback to the operating room. Sony officials say the biggestbenefit of the system is that surgeons wouldn't have to leaveoperating rooms in order to view lab results, thereby cuttingdown on the time a patient spends on the operating table.   The other new product is for cardiac recording. CalledCine Video, this system takes video images of a patient'sheart activity and digitally stores them in a library file.Sony said that digital storing of medical information alongwith video images will eventually replace much of thecumbersome filing now used in hospitals.   &quot;These systems are going to explode in the next 18months,&quot; says Michael Baron, the 39-year-old president ofSony Medical Electronics. Sony said Baylor University'smedical center in Dallas recently became the first hospitalto use the video surgical consultation system.   Other Japanese consumer electronics firms have crossedover into the medical field, but Sony is the first toestablish a separate division devoted to new medicalapplications. Mr. Baron, who was one of the originalproponents in the company for such uses of video technology,says Sony should be able to introduce more medical productsand grow quickly. &quot;There's no reason why we couldn't hit $500million in revenue in a relatively short time,&quot; he said,adding that the division is already making &quot;a solid profit.&quot;Sales currently are about $100 million a year.   Analysts say medical electronics may be a new anddifficult market for Sony, but the division has some thingsgoing for it -- the Sony name and the parent's deep pocketsand significant research and development resources. Moreover,it has already achieved some initial success in the fieldwith its thermal printer systems, which print hard copypictures from ultrasound and endoscopy imaging.   In a relatively short span of about two years, Sony'sthermal printers displaced traditional film technologyprinting.   Mr. Baron says the medical division has tried to find newuses for existing technology. To crack the market Sony chosea two-pronged approach. First Sony officials blitzed medicaltrade shows and handed out copies of its video imaging. Thenthe company pitched its products to manufacturers of medicalequipment, who in turn conducted clinical tests. &quot;Themanufacturers came back with rave reviews,&quot; says Mr. Baron.   Indeed, the relatively quick acceptance of Sony's thermalprinters in clinics and hospitals caught some of Sony'scompetitors off guard. Polaroid Corp. for example, which hada solid hold in the early 1980s on the ultrasound imagingmarkets with its instant imaging, found itself quickly losingmarket share. Struggling to get back into the game, Polaroidrecently announced plans to start marketing later this year anew medical imaging system.</TEXT></DOC>
