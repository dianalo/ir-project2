Texaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia are deeply involved in negotiations for the sale of a 50% interest in certain Texaco refineries, at a price of roughly $1.5 billion, according to a source close to the talks. The source said a letter of intent could be signed in as little as three weeks. However, another source, who is close to the Saudis, said an agreement isn't imminent.    Meanwhile, industry officials said Nigeria is holding discussions with at least four U.S. oil companies -- Sun Co., Salomon Inc.'s Hill Petroleum, Mapco Inc. and Crown Central Petroleum Corp. -- about purchasing equity interests of between 25% and 45% in any of their refining operations. Nigeria is holding similar discussions with Petromed of Spain.    Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister, who is currently the president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, wants to conclude agreements that would provide an oulet for as much as 500,000 barrels a day of Nigerian crude oil, or about half the country's current OPEC quota, said a source close to the negotiations.    Most of the companies in talks with Nigeria declined to make any immediate comment. But a spokesman for Radnor, Pa.-based Sun confirmed that the company had agreed &quot;to explore ways in which the Nigerian government might gain equity in Sun Refining andamp; Marketing,&quot; a unit.    Any move by OPEC members into U.S. refining and marketing operations could broadly reshape the structure of the U.S. oil industry. Ultimately, it also could show up at the gasoline pump, where direct access to lower-cost Middle eastern crude could enable U.S. refiners to deeply cut prices if price wars break out.    Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster, said that Saudi Arabia, for instance, could move its crude through Texaco's refineries and sell it, if it chose, for 40 cents a gallon -- and still earn a profit. He predicted that in the U.S. Texaco would conclude the first refining link-up with a foreign producer, followed by Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp. and Exxon Corp.    Two additional forces increase the imperative for oil exporters to link up with foreign refiners in the major consuming countries -- not just in the U.S., but in Europe as well. In the current world-wide glut of oil, exporters want the most direct access to as many markets as possible. At the same time, a world-wide glut of refining capacity has made refinery owners more inclined to unload interests in marginally profitable or unprofitable operations.    Indeed, refiners both large and small appear happy to oblige the oil exporters' wishes. Another source close to the Saudis said that some 45 oil companies with refineries had initiated contact with the kingdom about possible joint ventures in recent months -- in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Among them are the so-called Aramco four -- Texaco, Exxon, Chevron and Mobil, which operate Arabian American Oil Co. in Saudi Arabia.    The Aramco partners were approached last year by Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, who requested their advice on how best to go into so-called &quot;downstream,&quot; or refining and marketing, investments outside the Middle East. A team from Aramco since has had follow-up discussions with these companies, which already have certain partnership arrangements with the Saudis and want to preserve their long-term relationship with the kingdom.    &quot;The Saudis have been super partners,&quot; Allen E. Murray, chairman of Mobil, said in an interview last week.    If the Saudi talks with Texaco -- centering on a 50-50 partnership arrangement for a &quot;package&quot; of refineries -- result in an agreement, it would give the kingdom access to U.S. markets all the way to the gas pump for the first time ever. Texaco would operate the facilities, according to a source close to the proposed transaction, although the Saudis &quot;will have some say&quot; in their management. It hasn't yet been decided whether the Saudis would gain membership on Texaco's board.    The talks, which were previously reported, have been under way for about six weeks in London and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and have been led by Alfred C. DeCrane, Texaco's chairman. Although the Saudis have expressed interest in the Texaco assets for some time, they &quot;weren't prepared to proceed&quot; until Texaco had reached its preliminary settlement with Pennzoil Co. in their $10.3 billion litigation, the source said. Texaco holders are now voting on the proposed settlement, under which Texaco would pay Pennzoil $3 billion in cash.    The progress of Texaco's talks with the Saudis has left two other potential suitors waiting in the wings. Venezuela, as previously reported, also has held negotiations toward becoming a joint-venture partner with Texaco. The country is seeking to expand its direct outlet for crude, which currently totals about 500,000 barrels a day in the U.S., West Germany and Sweden, to 700,000 barrels a day.    &quot;Direct-market access has become an overriding necessity for the producer,&quot; Juan Chacin, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, said this week at the annual conference of the British Institute of Petroleum in London.    As reported, Kuwait, too, has held talks with Texaco. &quot;We have talked to Texaco,&quot; Nader H. Sultan, of Kuwait Petroleum International Ltd., said in an interview yesterday. &quot;But right now they (Texaco officials) are busy on other things,&quot; possibly the Saudis. &quot;We would be interested in talking further,&quot; he added.    An official of Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said yesterday that although Texaco is seeking a joint-venture partner, the Kuwaitis prefer outright ownership of foreign refining operations, which they have accumulated in Europe. In a speech at a British Institute function yesterday, Mr. Sultan said Kuwait continues to prefer its route of &quot;stand-alone investments.&quot; But in the interview, Mr. Sultan suggested that Kuwait eventually might reconsider its full-acquisition strategy. </TEXT></DOC>
