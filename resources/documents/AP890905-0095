(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hearing in Jim Bakker's fraud trial will beheld Wednesday and the TV evangelist, now in a prison hospital forpsychiatric tests, will be there, an official in the U.S. Marshal'soffice said today.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not saywhen Bakker would be released from the federal prison at Butner.   There was no immediate confirmation from Bakker's lawyers, whoare under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter.Bakker is accused of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry andcould receive up to 120 years in prison.   Potter on Thursday suspended Bakker's trial in Charlotte, N.C.,and sent him to a prison mental ward for tests Thursday afterBakker's psychiatrist testified he was hallucinating and coweringunder a couch.   Jurors were not told how long the trial would be delayed.   Tammy Bakker said in Orlando, Fla., today that her husband was``so out of it'' when marshals came to take him to a mental wardthat he thought he was going to an animal hospital.   But Mrs. Bakker told viewers of ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' thather husband wasn't mentally unstable.   ``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he just stressed out,''she said.   A crying Mrs. Bakker said the judge ``flew into a rage'' whentold Bakker couldn't come to court last week and ``ordered federalmarshals to seize him.''   ``Jim's constitutional rights have been violated,'' she said.``He has been treated like a carnival show.''   She said U.S. marshals wouldn't tell Bakker where he was goingand that he overheard them talk about Butner and confused it with ananimal hospital called Butler.   ``Jim was so out of it that he thought they were taking him to ananimal hospital,'' she said.   On Sunday, a minister told a gathering of Bakker's followers thatthe evangelist has endured unfair treatment in the prisonpsychiatric wing, including strip searches, handcuffs and denial oftoilet paper.   ``No matter what he has or has not done, it is unfair to give himthat type of treatment when he asked to go to the hospital,'' theRev. Roy Harthern told more than 100 people Sunday in the Bakker'sOrlando TV studio.   Bryan Bledsoe, a spokesman at Butner, confirmed this morning thatBakker had been handcuffed and strip searched, but said he was giventoilet paper.   ``That is standard operating procedure for that unit,'' Bledsoesaid. He said Bakker was not given a pillow his first night there.   ``It's standard in all these cases to first observe a person andobserve his condition before giving them something they may hurtthemselves with,'' he said.   Dr. Basil Jackson, Bakker's psychiatrist, said Monday that he wastold Butner officials had stepped up their evaluation of Bakker.   ``If that's true, then it's conceivable one of their people couldcome back into court Tuesday or Wednesday to certify that he's readyto come back into trial,'' he said.   Prison officials said last week that because Bakker had not beenconvicted of a crime, he would have the run of the prison groundsand wear his own clothes.</TEXT></DOC>
