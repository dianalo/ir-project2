On Tuesday, the financially hurting airline rejected bindingarbitration nearly as soon as the offer was made by the NationalMediation Board.   Under the federal board's rule, rejection of binding arbitrationby either side leads to a 30-day ``cooling-off period.'' Talkscontinue with mediators, but if no settlement is reached, the unioncan strike and the company can impose the conditions of its lastcontract offer.   The mediation board was expected to formally declare an impasseand start the 30-day clock today.   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the deadline pressure couldlead to a settlement, but union leader Charles E. Bryan said thecompany wants a walkout.   ``They've been spoiling for a strike,'' said Bryan, president ofDistrict 100 of the International Association of Machinists. ``Wedon't want a strike, but it looks (like) we're going to have toaccommodate them.''   Bakes said in a statement he was guardedly optimistic asettlement could be reached under deadline pressure.   ``A firm deadline is a very real and urgent incentive for boththe company and the union to work out differences,'' he said.   Company officials said they did not expect a major drop-off inadvance bookings because of a potential strike.   Tom Matthews, Eastern senior vice president for human resourcesand chief negotiator, wrote to the mediation board _ which enteredthe talks one year ago _ after receiving a Jan. 31 notice that bothsides were being offered arbitration. Matthews turned down the offer.   Matthews wrote, ``In a very real sense, the stakes for Easternare so fundamental, so very directly tied to whether Eastern cansurvive, that the company cannot in such a situation allow a thirdparty (or an arbitration board) to make those decisions.''   Bryan has long contended that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parentcompany, wants to break Eastern's unions and sell its assets.   ``They think they have a good chance of breaking the strike. Butthey've got alternatives and they don't really seem to care. Theattitude is if they destroy the company, so what?'' Bryan said.   The union leader said Tuesday the two sides met in secret talksdirected by mediation board chairman Walter C. Wallace for five daysstarting Jan. 18 in Savannah, Ga., but made little progress.   The company, which was seeking $150 million in wage concessionsfrom the union, estimates it's losing $1 million a day.   The machinists, representing mechanics, baggage handlers andother ground service workers, or more than one-fourth of Eastern'semployees, were seeking a $50 million raise, the company said.   To soften the impact of the proposed wage cuts, Eastern said itwould provide job security and training programs.   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first threequarters of 1988 and has lost more than $1 billion in the pastdecade.   Eastern is awaiting completion of a $365 million sale of itsNortheast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump and hassaid it must sell other assets to stay afloat unless it can reducelabor costs.   Texas Air also owns Continental Airlines, a non-union carrier.</TEXT></DOC>
