Rothschild Is Torn by Internal StrifeAs Prospects Grow for a Sale or Breakup---By Matthew WinklerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RSECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., reeling from massive losses and the prospect of a sale or breakup of the 88-year-old Wall Street securities firm, is experiencing growing internal strife.    &quot;A sale is imminent,&quot; asserts a Rothschild managing director, who is seeking another job. &quot;There are lots of firms that won't do business with us, and customers are starting to ask whether we're going to be around in the future.&quot;    Robert Schoenthal and Francois Mayer, co-chief executive officers, only say that Rothschild is undergoing &quot;a strategic review.&quot; Mr. Schoenthal says the study &quot;is designed to ensure the best interests of the company and its shareholders.&quot;    Without commenting directly on a sale or breakup, Mr. Schoenthal says: &quot;We're considering a lot of possibilities. A lot of our employees are waiting to see what we're going to do.&quot; He adds that &quot;things are very calm around here.&quot;    But just a management rung below the co-chief executives, managing directors paint a different picture. They say colleagues are covertly sniping at each other in attempts to protect their jobs while they seek employment elsewhere. They also report a disintegration of ethics among managers and staff. &quot;I bet $100,000 in equipment has walked out the door the past month,&quot; says a managing director.    Rothschild &quot;used to be a great place to work,&quot; says Robert Antolini, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. who was a managing director when he left Rothschild earlier this year. &quot;I feel bad for my friends there. It's natural for (the firm) to be sold.&quot;    Since Oct. 26, when Rothschild reported a monthly loss of slightly more than $44 million, or a quarter of its net worth, it has eliminated its municipal-finance, trading and sales departments and fired 150 people, or 7.5% of its work force of 2,000. In addition, Rothschild officials have been huddling with their investment-banking advisers at Salomon Brothers Inc. in an attempt to shore up the embattled firm for a possible sale.    Despite stockholders' equity of $135 million and total capital including borrowings of more than $250 million, &quot;L.F. Rothschild has a serious problem,&quot; says Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Sercurities Corp. &quot;They tried to play in the big leagues with Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, and they didn't have the capital or expertise. Any strategy they take now is likely to split the firm. My guess is at least a breakup of the firm will happen soon.&quot;    Messrs. Schoenthal and Mayer say they aren't aware of any petty thefts among employees and insist that Rothschild's current problems aren't much different from those other securities firms are facing. &quot;I don't think anything is going on here that's different from any other investment bank,&quot; Mr. Schoenthal says. &quot;Let's face it, Wall Street is considering its future.&quot;    According to the firm's co-chief executives, Rothschild decided to close its municipal bond operations well before it had a loss of $44 million last month. The timing of the layoffs in the wake of the stock crash &quot;was just a coincidence,&quot; Mr. Schoenthal says. The firm attributed the losses to its risk arbitrage department, which bet the firm's own money on takeover stocks and other speculations.    But several recently dismissed managing directors say the municipal bond department, which had been mostly profitable the past year, was cut to preserve jobs in the risk arbitrage department.    &quot;Two weeks before the entire municipal bond department was let go, Schoenthal and Mayer reassured everyone of their jobs,&quot; says a former Rothschild managing director who is currently unemployed.    According to several current and former Rothschild managing directors, Salomon Brothers in its role as Rothschild's adviser apparently had some influence in the firm's decision to abandon the municipal market. &quot;They basically panicked,&quot; says a senior official at a rival investment bank who recently left Rothschild. &quot;Salomon already had made its own decision to get out of municipals and they convinced Rothschild to do the same.&quot;    Mr. Antolini, the former Rothschild managing director now at Donaldson Lufkin, is equally cynical. &quot;It's typical of Wall Street: You keep the department that's losing money and cut the department that's making money,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;the fact is that's the way the business is run.&quot; Mr. Mayer says such assertions are &quot;total rubbish.&quot;    In any event, the cutbacks jolted many Rothschild clients, including those who attended a breakfast meeting last month. &quot;There couldn't have been many more than 20 or 30 of us,&quot; recalls John E. Haupert, treasurer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &quot;It was a day after (Rothschild) said it was getting out of the municipal market, and we were told another sponsor was picking up the tab&quot; for catering the breakfast, he says, adding, &quot;they must be really hurting not to be able to afford breakfast.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, shares of L.F. Rothschild, which isn't connnected to securities firm Rothschild Inc., closed at $6, up 75 cents. In March 1986, investors snapped up shares of the firm's $156 million initial public offering at $20.50 apiece.    Last year, the firm earned only $498,000, a steep drop from $22.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $401 million from $317.2 million. &quot;The way they're going, I don't think they'll make any money this year,&quot; says Mr. Long of Lipper.    &quot;Rothchild's demise wouldn't be significant in the long run,&quot; Mr. Long says. &quot;But it's quite significant to the securities in terms of what's happening on Wall Street right now. Firms are suddenly finding out they're in big trouble.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
