The civil settlement is a crucial condition for finalizing a muchbroader settlement of criminal charges against the investmentbanking firm, stemming largely from its past relationship withnow-imprisoned former financier Ivan F. Boesky.   Quoting sources it didn't identify, the Journal said SECcommissioners are expected to vote next Monday on the civilsettlement package, under negotiation for more than two months.   The report quoted the sources as saying the package, if approved,would allow Drexel to retain its high-yield, high-risk ``junk bond''operation in Beverly Hills, Calif.   Previously, the SEC had proposed in settlement negotiations thatDrexel relocate the junk bond division to its New York headquartersin order to more strictly supervise trading operations. Drexel hadcontended such a move would destroy its lucrative business in thehigh-yield securities.   Other elements of the civil settlement will force Drexel to makedozens of changes in management structure and proedures to enforcecompliance with federal and state securities laws, the Journalreport said.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the reportor speculate on when a settlement would be announced. SEC officialsin Washington also declined to comment in accordance with theagency's policy concerning pending cases.   The investment firm has been under investigation since late 1986,when Boesky implicated Drexel, senior junk bond financier MichaelMilken and others in what federal officials have called wide-rangingabuse of securities laws.   The SEC formally accused Drexel and Milken in September ofengaging in a litany of fraud violations that ranged from insidertrading to stock manipulation to client cheating.   The civil charges were overshadowed in December when theManhattan U.S. attorney's office, which had been conducting its ownprobe of Drexel, announced a criminal plea bargain agreement underwhich the firm would plead guilty to six felonies and pay a $650million fine. Federal prosecutors said that agreement could not befinalized until Drexel settled the SEC litigation.   Milken has continued to assert innocence of any wrongdoing and isexpected to be indicted soon on federal fraud and racketeeringcharges.   He also is challenging a provision of the criminal settlementthat would force Drexel to terminate his employment and deny his1988 compensation, estimated at more than $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
