I will not allow myself to behumiliated anymore. I will do everything I can not to cross the line beyondwhich lies the disintegration of the union. If something else comes about, Iwill simply raise the question of my resignation.&quot;;   Yeltsin, however,continued to act quickly and claimed the right of the Russian republic to vetoall foreign trade deals.
