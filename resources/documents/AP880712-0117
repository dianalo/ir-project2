The Five Freedoms Forum, which represents 25 human rights andreligious groups, said the focus of its campaign would be to electan anti-apartheid municipal council in Johannesburg, the country'slargest city.   Segregated elections for councils in white, black, mixed-raceand Asian communities are scheduled nationwide for Oct. 26, thefirst time voters of all races will go to the polls on the same day.   The government has outlawed public calls for an electionboycott, but black activists have said they oppose participation inany elections until South Africa's 26 million blacks are givenvoting rights on the national level.   Prominent anti-apartheid clergymen two weeks ago defied thegovernment ban and urged South Africans not to vote in October.   The Five Freedoms Forum, in a statement, said it was notcriticizing those who favored a boycott of the elections.   ``The Johannesburg City Council, as a whites-only body, is astructure infected with the racism implicit in the government'sapartheid policy,'' the statement said. ``However, despite theinadequacy of these structures, we do not believe that any purposewould be served by calling on whites to boycott.''   The statement said the elections could be used as a vehicle forcampaigning against apartheid laws such as the Group Areas Act,which establishes racially segregated residential districts.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a segregated society inwhich the blacks have no vote in national affairs, controlled bythe 5 million whites.   The government is spending more than $2 million on anadvertising campaign to promote participation in the elections.   Officials of Transvaal Province, which includes Johannesburg andPretoria, on Tuesday called on employers to help their blackworkers register to vote by obtaining forms that could be filledout at workplaces.</TEXT></DOC>
