Analysisof oxidation kinetics for AISI 4140 steel indicates, however, that theservice environment could not have caused the observed scale thicknessesin the microcracks. One- and two-dimensional stress analyses confirmmodest cyclic stresses and maximum stresses in the range of 531 to 683MPa (77 to 99 ksi), not the 827 MPa (120 ksi) level implied by crackgrowth from 0.76 mm (0.03 in.) flaws. To account for the observed cycliclife of about 1500 cycles, the initial defects would have to be 8.6 mm(0.34 in.) to 16.8 mm (0.66 in.) long, according to fracture mechanicsanalyses performed by an influence function method. On the basis of allthe results, it is concluded that small cracks were already in the wheelwhen it went to into service.</TEXT></DOC>
