(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``I thought my rainbow had come in,'' GeorgeWells said.   There were signs of trouble, though. For one thing, the rainbowended in a can of paint, not a pot of gold.   Wells and Anthony Verdile, both New York State Bridge Authorityworkers, were on the catwalk of a bridge over the Hudson Rivermaking a routine check Tuesday when Verdile spotted the can about30 feet below the road.   He went climbed down and opened the can to find scads of $20bills. He climbed back up and found a slight hitch.   ``As soon as you looked at them you could tell they werecounterfeit because all had the same serial numbers,'' said Verdile.   Except for that detail, the counterfeit bills were ``pretty welldone,'' said Sgt. Dennis Cody of the State Police after the $39,900was inspected and counted.   ``I guess I'll just keep playing Lotto,'' Verdile said.</TEXT></DOC>
