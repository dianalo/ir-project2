Everyone is. How much time can a company give to South Africa before you say, look, is it bloody well worth it? We accept in principle that the time may come when we have to act.&quot;    The executive, speaking anonymously and with feeling, works in London for a British company that has an unshakeable commitment, in public, to keeping a tight grip on its South African investments. If he has second thoughts, there would be few in Europe who don't.    &quot;I doubt if there's a boardroom in the country that hasn't had the subject under discussion,&quot; says Sir Leslie Smith, chairman of the British Industry Committee on South Africa, who sits on the boards of BOC Group PLC and Cadbury Schweppes PLC, both of which have operations in South Africa.    The subject is surely a live one in Europe's boardrooms after last week's news that Barclays Bank PLC had sold what was left of its stake in South Africa's biggest bank. Only the most hopeful of anti-apartheid activists expect Barclays's sale to provoke an exodus from South Africa like the one in full swing among U.S. companies. But the mood shows signs of changing.    &quot;In comparison to the Americans, who are quitters, the Europeans seem to be stayers,&quot; says Geoffrey Hamilton, whose report on Europe's companies in South Africa was issued last week. The publisher was a research institute in Geneva supported by Nestle S.A., one of Europe's more adamant stayers.    Yet Barclays's decision, as some see it, may tip the balance for companies that have stayed in South Africa in the hope of helping to end apartheid, while wishing they could find an excuse to get out.    &quot;Many are going to think, 'Thank God Barclays have done it,'&quot; says Philip Ashfield, a stockbroker in the independent London firm Teather Greenwood. &quot;Barclays have made the choice -- that staying is no longer essential to their concept of social responsibility.&quot;    For the South African government, thoughts like that will weigh more heavily on the future than any American pullout. At least 60% of the country's foreign investment comes from Europe; before the recent withdrawals, the U.S. accounted for just 30%. Between 1982 and 1984, Europe's banks had a hand in $9 billion of loans to South Africa; U.S. banks figured in one-tenth that amount.    Of the 400,000 black South Africans who work for multinational companies, some 350,000 work for Europeans. Before it decided to pull out, General Motors Corp. had a work force of 3,000. More than 20 European companies each employ more (see chart).    Few of these companies, especially those in Switzerland and West Germany, will hint in public of leaving. Barclays didn't either, until it made its break. But well before that move, a subtle trend had begun in Britain, South Africa's biggest foreign investor by far, toward quiet disengagement.    Several smaller companies -- Smiths Industries PLC, Valor PLC, Crown House PLC -- have sold out entirely. The big British insurer, Prudential Corp., which isn't related to the U.S. insurance company, swapped its majority in a South African branch last fall for 7% of Liberty Life Association of South Africa Ltd. Jim Sutcliffe, assistant general manager of Prudential's international division, gives &quot;a shortage of skilled staff&quot; as the reason.    British Electric Traction Co. has pared its freight and bus businesses in similar fashion, and is the subject of London talk of more to come. Metal Box PLC now owns only 25% of Metal Box South Africa Ltd. And Turner andamp; Newall PLC, a construction contractor, has brought its holding in a South African affiliate down to 51% from 78% &quot;to improve the company's image on the stock market.&quot;    As Barclays did earlier, other British companies have cut South African holdings by sticking to the sidelines during share sales. Standard Chartered PLC, now the biggest foreign bank in the country, shrunk its slice from 53% to under 40% in 1984. Hill Samuel andamp; Co., which put together more South African loans in 1985 than any other foreign bank, expects to come out of a current rights issue with 13% of its South African namesake, instead of 70%. (In a rights issue, existing shareholders are offered new shares in the company.)    &quot;We thought it would be better to make the company more obviously South African,&quot; says Dolf Mootham, its finance director. &quot;Quite honestly, it's pretty peripheral to our business.&quot;    In September, the Common Market imposed a set of sanctions on South Africa, including a &quot;voluntary ban&quot; on new investment. They aren't nearly as stringent as the sanctions passed by the U.S. Congress over President Reagan's veto. Indirectly, however, they may act as another constraint on Europeans.    For all this, few companies in Europe feel anything like the push to quit South Africa that has become the norm in America, where race is an important issue and blacks have political clout. Some Europeans, on the contrary, see a positive incentive to stay. Unlike the Americans, they can't retreat into big home markets. But as the crisis deepens, their prospects in South Africa could well brighten.    Some West German companies seem eager to fill the void left once the Americans withdraw. Daimler-Benz AG decided last year to spend an extra $75 million in its South African car plant. Over the past three years, Volkswagen AG gave its operations $200 million, double its investment of the previous three years. As other makers pull out, says a VW spokesman, &quot;we will try to increase our sales there.&quot;    With sanctions cutting imports, predicts Sir Leslie of the British Industry Committee, manufacturers still in South Africa stand to clean up. &quot;I think the South African economy is going to go through a bit of a boom in the next few years,&quot; he says.    Europe's anti-apartheid activists clearly have a lot to do. Yet in Bonn last weekend, several thousand demonstrators turned out to protest West German industry support for South Africa. And Barclays heartened British groups when it cited, as a reason for withdrawal, their 16-year campaign to dissuade students from opening accounts.    The movement now plans to concentrate its fire on Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Standard Chartered, two companies that say they don't plan to leave.    Moreover, since South Africa heated up, so-called ethical investing has begun to make a mark on Europe.    It doesn't hold a candle to the U.S., where investors have tied an estimated $300 billion in assets to companies' South Africa policies. But West Germany's Protestant churches are threatening to take their money out of Deutsche Bank if it doesn't reduce its South African activity. And Britain's first three ethical-investment funds have opened in the past two years.    Of Britain's 95 local-authority governments, 14 have curbed investment in South Africa; their pension funds have a combined worth of $6 billion. The authorities plan to press a shareholder resolution at Shell calling for the company to withdraw from South Africa, and expect to meet this week with its board.    Few activists, however, seriously expect European companies to abandon South Africa in the face of shareholder resolutions alone. They say only commercial prospects will lead a company to conclude, as Barclays apparently did, that the country is no longer worth the pain.    &quot;There may be differences in pressure on companies in the U.S. and the U.K.,&quot; says Stuart Bell of Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, &quot;but they'll all come up with the same answer in the end: take the money and run.&quot;    ---   European Companies in South Africa    Top 20 Employers                     Number of Workers Company               in South Africa Consolidated Gold Fields (British)                      93,851 Imperial Chemical Industries (British)                      27,000 Standard Chartered (British)                      22,848 Lornho (British)                      10,817 Courtaulds (British)                       8,198 Royal Dutch/Shell Group (British/Dutch)                 8,160 Pilkington Brothers (British)                       8,016 Unilever (British/Dutch)                 7,372 British Electric Traction (British)                       7,238 BTR (British)                       6,482 Volkswagen (West German)                   6,000 Siemens (West German)                   5,700 BOC Group (British)                       5,666 Daimler-Benz (West German)                   5,000 British Petroleum (British)                       4,880 General Electric* (British)                       4,677 Holderbank Financiere Glarus (Swiss)                         4,500 Rio Tinto-Zinc (British)                       4,310 B.A.IT Industries (British)                       4,139 Nestle (Swiss)                         4,000 *No relation to G.E. of the U.S. Source: Common Market; British, Dutch and Swissanti-apartheid movements, company information.</TEXT></DOC>
