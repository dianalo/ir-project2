BothDNA damage and loss of cell survival occurred ca.5 times more rapidlyat 43{sup 0} than at 37{sup 0}. In contrast, 43{sup 0}-hyperthermia aloneresulted in no detectable DNA damage, even though the rate of cell killingwas similar at 43{sup 0} w/o SPD and at 37{sup 0} with SPD. Alkalinesucrose gradients showed a progressive decrease in the MW of DNA withincreasing exposure to SPD at 43{sup 0} (60-150 min). Cytotoxicity andDNA damage by SPD were partially inhibited with the addition of 2) catalase(500 U/ml, 2) 15 nM thiourea, or 3) aminoguanidine (AG) to media. AGreduced DNA damage by 15%, 90% and 96%, respect., at 10/sup -5/, 10/sup-4/, and 10/sup -3/M. Similarly, replacement of media with HBSS reducedSPD toxicity, DNA damage was enhanced by depleting cellular GSH priorto SPD exposure with buthionine sulfoximine (0.1 nm, 16 h,37{sup 0}).SPD-induced DNA damage was partially repaired with (4h,37{sup 0}) afterSPD/3h,37{sup 0} (39.5%) or SPD/90'43{sup 0} (22%). Thermotolerance (10',45{sup0} + 6h,37{sup 0}) did not reduce SPD toxicity. The alkaline elutionprofile of DNA from cells exposed to SPD resembled that after H/sub 2/O/sub2/ exposure, but not that of acrolein, another possible product of amineoxidation. The authors propose that toxicity is mediated by radicalsand peroxide formed during SPD oxidation via mechanisms that are clearlydistinct from those mediating hyperthermia toxicity.</TEXT></DOC>
