Later, Gilbert(1898) and Evermann and Meek (1898) described two other species of <T3>Chasmistes</T3> from the same lake. A careful review of all availablespecimens, however, documented that <T3>brevirostris</T3> is the only valid species of <T3>Chasmistes</T3> from Upper Klamath Lake and that the other two ``species''were merely sex or condition variants of <T3>brevirostris</T3> (Miller and Smith 1981).The Lost River sucker was originally placed in the genus <T3>Chasmistes </T3>by cope (1879). <T3>Deltistes</T3>, a monotypic genus, was erected for the Lost River suckerin 1896 based on the delta-shaped gill rakers (Seale 1896). In additionto the deltoid, short gill rakers, the Lost River sucker is characterizedby subterminal mouth, small hump on the snout (at least in preserved specimens),and large size of adults (ca. 10 lbs.). The primary morphological charactersthat distinguish the shortnose sucker from other species of <T3>Chasmistes</T3> include the presence of a terminal, oblique mouth withweak or no papillae on the lips. Scales are small, with 65 to 79 in thelateral line and 21 to 25 around the caudal peduncle (Miller and Smith1981).Upper Klamath Lake and its tributaries are now the primary refuge for boththe Lost River and shortnose suckers. A substantial population of shortnosesuckers occurs in Copco Reservoir on the Klamath River, but the Lost Riversucker population has practically been eliminated there (Beak Consultants1987). Remnant or highly hybridized populations of these two species occurin the Lost River system and other nearby areas.In addition to Upper Klamath Lake, Copco Reservoir, and their tributarystreams, shortnose suckers and Lost River suckers have been collected fromIron Gate Reservoir, California (California Dept. of Fish and Game 1980),J.C. Boyle Reservoir, Oregon (Jeff S. Ziller, pers. comm.) and Clear LakeReservoir, California (Coots 1965, Loch <T3>et al. </T3>1975). Additionally, shortnose suckers have been collectedfrom Lake of the Woods, Oregon (Andreasen 1975a). The Lost River suckeralso was known from Sheepy Lake, Lower Klamath Lake and Tule Lake in California(Coots 1965).The populations of shortnose and Lost River suckers in Copco and Iron GateReservoirs may have resulted from drift of individuals downstream in theKlamath River from Upper Klamath Lake. Specimens of shortnose suckers collectedfrom Copco Reservoir in 1962, 1978 and 1979 were introgressed with theKlamath smallscale sucker (<T3>Catostomus rimiculus</T3>) (Miller and Smith 1981). Nonetheless, Millerand Smith (1981) regarded the Copco Reservoir population as consistingof a ``relatively intact gene pool of <T3>Chasmistes brevirostris</T3>.'' A few shortnose suckers have recentlybeen collected from J.C. Boyle Reservoir, located along the Klamath Riverbetween Upper Klamath Lake and Copco Reservoir. The status of this population,which appears quite small, is uncertain. Other reaches of the Klamath Riverbetween Copco Reservoir and Upper Klamath Lake also may harbor small remnantpopulations of both species. The remaining populations of shortnose suckershave not fared as well. The Lake of the Woods population was lost in 1952during a fish eradication program aimed at removing carp and perch fromthe lake (Andreasen 1975a). The Clear Lake Reservoir population of shortnosesuckers shows evidence of extensive hybridization with the Klamath largescalesucker (<T3>Catostomus snyderi</T3>) (Williams <T3>et al</T3>. 1985), but further work is needed to precisely determinethe genetic constitution of suckers in this system.A few Lost River suckers have been collected from J.C. Boyle Reservoirin the Klamath River between Upper Klamath Lake and Copco Reservoir (JeffS. Ziller, pers. comm.). Only one Lost River sucker was collected fromCopco Reservoir in 1987 despite intensive collection efforts (Beak Consultants1987). Populations of Lost River suckers in Sheepy Lake, Lower KlamathLake and Tule Lake were lost after 1924, when the lakes were drained forfarming (Moyle 1976). Prior to 1924, large numbers of Lost River suckerswere taken from Sheepy Creek, the spawning stream tributary to Sheepy Lake,for human consumption and livestock feed (Coots 1965). The Clear Lake Reservoirpopulation of Lost River suckers is the last known remnant of the speciesin the Lost River system. The population in Clear Lake Reservoir is smalland suffers from large numbers of exotic species and lack of sufficientspawning area (Koch <T3>et al</T3>. 1975).The primary factors in the widespread decline of the shortnose sucker andLost River sucker have included damming of rivers, instream flow diversion,draining of marshes, dredging of Upper Klamath Lake and other forms ofwater manipulation. Dams have been particularly destructive in that theyhave blocked spawning runs of the fish and facilitated hybridization withother types of suckers in the dam's tailwaters. Although the constructionof large reservoirs may provide suitable feeding and resting habitat forthese lacustrine species, the reservoirs often lack long stretches of largeinflowing rivers that are necessary for successful spawning. Such is thecase in Clear Lake Reservoir, where small intermittent creeks are the onlyhabitat that remains for spawning attempts.Survey work performed in 1984-1986 by the Oregon Department of Fish andWildlife, The Klamath Tribe, and the Service have shown drastic declinesin the largest remaining populations of both species in Upper Klamath Lake(Bienz and Ziller, ms.). During the 1984 survey, the population of shortnosesuckers moving out of Upper Klamath Lake in the spawning run was estimatedat 2,650 individuals. The 1985 and 1986 surveys found too few shortnosesuckers to accurately estimate the population size. The catch per uniteffort of shortnose suckers declined 34 percent between the 1984 and 1985spawning runs. In 1986, catch per effort statistics yielded 74 percentdecrease in the spawning run when compared to 1985. Although the populationlevels of the Lost River sucker have remained substantially above thosecritically low levels observed for the shortnose, the overall decline hasbeen equally precipitous. In 1984, a population of 23,123 Lost River suckerswas estimated in the Upper Klamath Lake spawning run. By the 1985 spawningrun, the population had declined to 11,861 (Bienz and Ziller, ms.). Althoughthe shortnose sucker and Lost River sucker are long-lived (up to at least43 years in the latter species), the drastic decline can be explained bylack of successful spawning. No significant recruitment of young into thepopulations has occurred for approximately 18 years (Scoppettone 1986).The Service included both the Lost River and shortnose suckers in category2 of its December 30, 1982, comprehensive notice of review (47 FR 58954)of vertebrate species under consideration for listing as endangered orthreatened. Category 2 includes those species for which information indicatesthat proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriatebut for which additional data are needed. These two suckers were maintainedin the September 18, 1985, update (50 FR 37958) of the 1982 notice. Surveysconducted since 1984 provided the additional information on which to basea proposed rule. The shortnose sucker and Lost River sucker were proposedas endangered species on August 26, 1987 (52 FR 32145-32149) in accordancewith section 4(b) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the August 26, 1987, proposed rule (52 FR 32145-32149) and associatednotifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factualreports or information that might contribute to the development of a finalrule. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, city governments,Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested partieswere contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting publiccomments were published in the <T3>Ashland Tidings </T3>(September 22, 1987), <T3>Medford Mail Tribune </T3>(September 22, 1987), <T3>Redding Record-Searchlight </T3>(September 22, 1987), <T3>Klamath Falls Herald andamp; News </T3>(September 20, 1987), <T3>The Oregonian </T3>(September 20, 1987), and <T3>Siskiyou News </T3>(September 20, 1987).A total of 13 written comments were received during the 60-day commentperiod following publication of the proposed rule. Comments were submittedby two Federal agencies, two State agencies, one Indian tribe, one Citygovernment, five conservation organizations, and two private parties. Twelveresponses supported listing and one response expressed no opinion regardingthe listing. No comments in opposition to the listing were received. TheCity of Klamath Falls took no position regarding the listing, but offeredresults of studies on the potential impact of the proposed Salt Caves HydroelectricProject on both species. It is the opinion of the City that the projectwould not impact either species, however, data to support this positionare lacking. Government agencies writing to express their support for thelisting included the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, CaliforniaDepartment of Fish and Game, and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.In addition to voicing support for the listing, The Klamath Tribe, DesertFishes Council, Rogue Chapter of the Sierra Club, and Save our KlamathRiver also stated their belief that critical habitat should be officiallydesignated for both species. The critical habitat designation is discussedbelow.Additional data on the decline of the shortnose sucker and Lost River suckerwere provided by The Klamath Tribe, California Department of Fish and Game,Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and an independent biologist familiarwith the species. As appropriate, this additional information was incorporatedinto this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the shortnose sucker and Lost River suckershould be classified as endangered species. Procedures found at section4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the fivefactors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their applicationto the shortnose sucker (<T3>Chasmistes brevirostris </T3>and Lost River sucker (<T3>Deltistes luxatus</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Initial biological surveys of the KlamathBasin indicated the presence of large populations of fishes, and suckersin particular (Cope 1879, Gilbert 1898). Spawning runs of suckers fromUpper Klamath Lake were large enough to provide a major food source forIndians and local settlers. The shortnose sucker and Lost River suckerwere staples in the diet of the Klamath Indians for thousands of years(Charles E. Kimbol, pers. comm.). In the late 1890's, a cannery was operatedfor commercial harvest of the Lost River sucker on the Lost River nearOlene, Oregon (Howe 1984). Even through the 1960's and 1970's, runs ofsuckers moving from Upper Klamath Lake up into the Williamson and SpragueRivers were great enough to provide a major sport fishery that annuallyattracted many people from throughout the West (Bienz and Ziller, ms.;John Fortune, pers. comm.). The primary species was the larger Lost Riversucker, locally known as mullet, but significant numbers of shortnose suckersalso occurred in the runs. During the past years, however, The KlamathTribe and local biologists have been so alarmed by the population declineof both suckers that in 1987, the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission closedthe fishery for both species and place them on the State's list of protectedspecies. Causes of the declines are varied and not fully understood. Clearly, therehas been a drastic reduction in spawning success. Recent data show thatneither species of sucker has successfully spawned in Oregon for approximately18 years (Bienz and Ziller, ms.; Scoppettone 1986). Similar results haverecently been obtained for populations of both species in Copco Reservoir,California (Beak Consultants 1987). Most of the spawing habitat for theshortnose sucker and Lost River sucker in the Upper Klamath Lake drainagehas been lost. The primary factor may have been the construction of theSprague River Dam at Chiloquin, Oregon. The dam is located just upstreamof the junction of the Sprague and Williamson Rivers and probably eliminatedmore than 95 percent of the historical spawning habitat. Neither the shortnosesucker nor Lost River sucker spawn in the Williamson River upstream ofits confluence with the Sprague. Fish ladders have been constructed atvarious times on the Sprague River Dam but their effectiveness in facilitatingmovement of suckers around the structure has been minimal to non-existentbecause, although these suckers are strong-swimmers, their leaping abilityis greatly limited. Any successfully-spawned larvae may be diverted intoagricultural fields by unscreened irrigation pumps and diversions. Minorsecondary spawning occurred in the larger springs that flow from alongthe shores of Upper Klamath Lake. However, the usefulness of these spawningareas along the east shore of the lake was lost when a railroad was constructedand riprap was used to fill in the springs. Further problems may have beencaused by decreases in water quality that result from timber harvest, dredgingactivities, removal of riparian vegetation and livestock grazing. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Prior to 1987, Oregon State law allowed a snag fishery forthe Lost River sucker. In 1987, the Oregon Fish and Game Commission removedboth species from the list of fishes in the State that may be harvested.The shortnose sucker was incidentally taken each spring during its spawningruns by sport fishermen snagging the larger Lost River sucker. In the 1985sport fishery, Lost River suckers comprised 92 percent of the catch, whereasshortnose and Klamath largescale accounted for 3 and 6 percent, respectively(Bienz and Ziller, ms.). Prior to recent population declines, some recreationaltake of the shortnose sucker and Lost River sucker was acceptable. No commercialtake is known. It should be noted that nearly all scientific data has beenobtained from fish collected in natural die-offs (see Factor E, below),or during sport fishing. High mortality of the shortnose sucker occurredduring a recent study at Copco Reservoir (Beak Consultants 1987), indicatingthat great care should be taken in future studies of these species. C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Exotic fishes have been stocked into theKlamath Basin and have played some role in the decline of the shortnosesucker and Lost River sucker. In addition to preying on young suckers,such exotic species can serve as sources of parasites and/or diseases.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>Recent actionby the State of Oregon to remove the shortnose sucker and Lost River suckerfrom the list of fishes that may be harvested, and place both species onthe State's list of protected species has improved the adequacy of regulationsto protect these species. California State Law lists the shortnose suckerand Lost River sucker as endangered. Although the California EndangeredSpecies Act has provisions for State agencies to consult with the CaliforniaDepartment of Fish and Game on projects affecting State-listed species,neither State law protects habitat of the species from projects that arepermitted, funded or carried-out by Federal agencies. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Hybridization with the Klamath largescale and Klamath smallscale suckershas been recognized as a problem in maintaining the genetic purity of shortnosesucker populations (Miller and Smith 1981, Williams <T3>et al. </T3>1985). Similarly, hybridization between the Klamath largescalesucker and Lost River sucker has been reported in Upper Klamath Lake (Andreasen1975a). Although hybridization occurs naturally between many species ofsuckers (family Catostomidae), increased incidence of hybridization occursif one of the parental species experiences a major population decline,as in the case of the shortnose sucker. Further hybridization is facilitatedby dams that block spawning runs and force individuals of closely relatedspecies to spawn in mass in the dam's tailwaters. Spawning of the shortnose,Lost River and Klamath largescale sucker occurs below the Sprague RiverDam at Chiloquin. An additional source of mortality is late-summer die-offs in Upper KlamathLake. A major die-off of Lost River and shortnose suckers was observedduring 1986 that resulted from blue-green algal blooms (genus <T3>Aphanizomenon</T3>) (Scoppettone 1986). Sucker die-offs do not occurevery year, but may occur in dry or particulary hot years. Pollution ofthe lake and decreased summer inflows, perhaps caused by diversion of waterfor agricultural purposes, aggravate this phenomenon. The presence of exotics, such as fathead minnows (<T3>Pimephales promelas</T3>) and yellow perch (<T3>Perca flavescens</T3>), may inhibit recovery. Fathead minnows werefirst documented in the Klamath River system during 1974 and have now spreadinto Upper Klamath Lake, where they have become abundant (Andreasen 1975b;Jeff S. Ziller, pers. comm.). The minnows may compete with the native suckersfor food. Perhaps in response to the increased number of fathead minnows,the yellow perch population in Upper Klamath Lake has increased recently(Jeff S. Ziller, pers. comm.). The perch are potential predators on larvalsuckers and may be a major factor in preventing any young suckers frombeing recruited into the population. Exotic fishes in the Lost River systeminclude bullheads (<T3>Ictalurus </T3>spp.), largemouth bass (<T3>Micropterus salmoides</T3>), crappie (<T3>Pomoxis </T3>sp.), green sunfish (<T3>Lepomis cyanellus</T3>), and Sacramento perch (<T3>Archoplites interruptus</T3>) (Koch <T3>et al. </T3>1975; Jack E. Williams, pers. obs.). The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailabe regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the shortnose and Lost River suckers asendangered. Threatened status would not adequately reflect the sharp declineof either species, lack of recruitment, or the continued threat to remaininghabitat fragments. Critical habitat is not being designated for this speciesat this time for reasons discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="85">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent or determinablefor these species at this time. As noted in Factor ``A'' of the above ``Summaryof Factors Affecting the species'' much of the historic spawning groundsof the Upper Klamath Lake population is no longer accessible because adam blocks the spawning run near the confluence of the Sprague and WilliamsonRivers. Similarly, dams on the Klamath River downstream of Upper KlamathLake have eliminated or blocked access to spawning habitat. Therefore,determining the boundaries of areas to be included as critical habitatis difficult. Further, agency personnel are well-aware of the distributionof both species through the Klamath Basin Sucker Interagency Working Group.Little additional benefits of notification of the species presence wouldbe achieved through critical habitat designation. Because of these factors,the Service finds that the determination of critical habitat cannot bemade at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal actions that may affect the shortnose sucker and Lost River suckerare issuances of lincenses or permits for dam projects by the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission; grazing or timber harvesting practices on ForestService land in the Upper Klamath Lake and Clear Lake Reservoir watersheds;and agreements, leases, or other arrangements between the Klamath Tribeand local irrigation interests that would result in the diversion of waterfrom the Williamson or Sprague Rivers; and management of canals and diversionstructures by the Bureau of Reclamation. Permitting activities of the ArmyCorps of Engineers pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act or section10 of the River and Harbor Act also may be affected. The Act implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a seriesof general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife.These prohibitions, in part, would make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import, ship in interstatecommerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for salein interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegalto possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlifethat has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of theService and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered fish or wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulationsgoverning permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. In some instances, permits may be issued during a specifiedperiod of time to relieve undue economic hardship that would be sufferedif such relief were not available. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not beprepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a)of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining theService's reasons for this determination was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Andreasen, J.K. 1975a.
