Genetically engineered plants and microbes are ``notintrinsically dangerous,'' the study found. But the experts saidfield tests should be allowed only after evaluating the effect onthe environment if the modified organism were to ``escape'' from thetest area.   ``We feel fairly confident that if this thing is done right itwill not pose any hazard,'' said Robert H. Burris, an emeritusprofessor of biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin. ``Wehope that this will be reassuring to the public.''   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a long-timeopponent of field testing of genetically-altered organisms, attackedthe report as ``irresponsible public policy.'' He said science hasno way to evaluate the risks of releasing such organisms into theenvironment.   Burris, who was chairman of the academy's committee on evaluationof introduction of gene-modified microorganisms and plants, saidthat some 80 modified plants and microbes have been tested in theenvironment and ``we haven't had any accidents as yet.''   The committee said that federal agencies reviewing field testproposals should base approval on three points: how familiarscientists are with the modified organism; how well the organismwill be confined or controlled, and the probability of adverseeffects on the environment if the organism were to escape from thefield test.   Science is now able to manipulate basic characteristics of plantsand bacteria by adding, removing or rearranging genes. For instance,a bacteria that resists the formation of ice has been sprayed onstrawberries to help the plants resist frost. Some bacteria has beenexperimentally altered so that it would break down pollutants. Andsome tomato plant genes have been altered to make the fruit morefirm.   Rifkin's organization and some other public advocacy groups,however, have objected that field testing genetically-alteredorganisms runs the risk of releasing into the environment a plant orbacteria that could cause ecological disaster.   He said some other nations, including Japan and Denmark, have puta five-year moratorium on testing genetically-altered organismsbecause of the uncertainty of the risk.   Rifkin said the National Academy of Sciences report is ``politicsand not science'' and added, ``We will oppose theserecommendations.''   Burris said, however, that the committee examined the dangers andbelieves the hazards can be controlled if federal agencies followthe three-part guidelines in considering field test applications.   The report said the ``major environmental risk'' from geneticmodification of plants is that an altered plant will escapecultivation and become a weed species, or that it will pollinatewild plants and create a new type of weed.   ``The likelihood of enhanced weediness is low for geneticallymodified, highly domesticated crop plants,'' the report said.   Modified microorganisms, such as bacteria, pose another kind ofhazard because they are prone to spontaneous mutations, suggestingthe possibility that a damaging organism could developed from onethat had been manipulated by man.   The report said that such a hazard could be controlled by addingto the modified microorganism a ``suicide gene.'' This would be agenetic instruction that would cause the organism to die when itencounters a temperature change or is deprived of certain types ofnutrients.   Genetic manipulations of this type, the report said, could``guarantee that the organism could not survive outside the targetenvironment.''   The committee determined that there was no need to changeexisting laws. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and theEnvironmental Protection Agency currently regulate field testing ofmodified organisms.   ``The laws that exist now are adequate for this,'' said Burris.``We're not suggesting that any laws be changed.''   Burris said genetic manipulation of microorganisms and plants hasgreat promise for a wide variety of uses.   Some manipulated bacteria, he said, could be used to removesulphur or other undesirable elements from mineral ore, leading to aconcentration of minerals in an ore that might otherwise not beeconomically recovered.   Microbes also could be manipulated so that they would ``eat''toxic pollutants, changing the poisons in chemical dumps, forexample, into inert gasses, he said.   By manipulating genes, agricultural scientists could develop foodplants that are resistant to insects, disease or drought, Burrissaid.</TEXT></DOC>
