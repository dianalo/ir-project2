The change is expected to be announced today in Austin, signaling a major philosophical shift from the consortium's secretive early days when it was run by former Central Intelligence Agency director Adm. Bob Inman. Along with providing increased access to its research, MCC also is placing greater emphasis on developing and deploying the technology it invents.    Stephen G. Maysonave, director of shareholder relations for MCC's Advanced Computing Technology Program, jokes that the program's early mission statement could have been summarized as &quot;do great research.&quot; Today, he adds, there is increased emphasis on &quot;market relevance.&quot;    That comes as sweet music to the half-dozen ACT participants who, to date, have sunk approximately $100 million into its projects. &quot;This makes a lot more sense,&quot; says Roy Kuntz, director of applied research for NCR Corp., who believes that MCC erred in its early exclusivity. Adds Walter Fredrickson, vice president of technology, information systems sector, of Harris Corp.: &quot;This is just a recognition that there's a lot of good work going on that needs to get out. Hey -- we're in this for the United States. We're in it to increase productivity.&quot;    In 1982, when the Japanese announced an aggressive research effort to build a &quot;Fifth-Generation&quot; computer, U.S. technology companies panicked. The Japanese, after all, had mounted come-from-behind efforts to trounce the U.S. steel, auto and consumer-electronics industries. Now they were promising to be leaders, not followers, and they were doing so with assistance from the Japanese government. A concerted response was needed. MCC was that answer, its membership initially restricted to U.S. companies but later broadened to include Canadian companies.    Seven years later, MCC officials acknowledge there was an &quot;over-reaction&quot; to the Japanese threat, as well as &quot;naive&quot; expectations of how quickly the Fifth Generation could be designed. There also have been embarrassing setbacks, including defections by some founding members and the decision last year to scrap nearly four years of development work on a computer-aided design system that didn't deliver as promised.    But MCC's members also have started chafing under the financial burden of supporting research that won't show a financial return for many years. Shareholder membership in MCC -- a prerequisite for sharing in proprietary research -- costs $250,000 and requires participation in at least one of five research programs, at a minimum annual cost of $1.5 million. Not surprisingly, the circle of potential participants has been severely limited.    With today's announcement, however, MCC is throwing open the doors to its largest program, the ACT Program, which encompasses a smorgasbord of information technology research. MCC says non-shareholders now can pay annual dues of $25,000 to become associate members and then can pick and choose from among 10 or more projects within the ACT Program that they want to support. Support costs for individual projects start at approximately $125,000 a year.    The a-la-carte approach also is being made available to MCC's shareholders. Previously, they had to support all projects within at least one research program. Honeywell and Motorola are among the MCC shareholders who will now participate in at least some ACT projects for the first time.    As the largest of MCC's five research efforts, eating up almost a third of its $65 million budget, ACT also is the heart of the original effort to build the Fifth Generation. Such computers are intended to duplicate the human thought process, using &quot;if-then&quot; logic and learning from experience. They would interact with their human users, asking questions to fill in gaps in knowledge and perhaps gaining additional awareness through sensors. That, at least, has been the goal.    In practice, developing the Fifth Generation has meant a multitude of closely related research efforts moving in fits and starts and not always in step with each other. The ACT Program now includes components as diverse as neural networks, which try to recognize patterns and predict behavior; the human interface, an &quot;intelligent&quot; work surface that can convert handwriting and sketches into computer data; and natural language ability, extending computer understanding to everyday English. All are still in the development stage but already are spinning off potential applications in the same way that the lunar space program developed freeze-dried food and lightweight materials long before a human set foot on the moon.    Grant Dove, MCC chief executive, says the consortium is making an increased effort to identify such short-term spinoffs without losing sight of its long-term goal. &quot;Our survival is dependent on that,&quot; he says. Seven years ago, the Japanese threat was enough to force chief executives in the U.S. to look beyond the next quarter's bottom line. Today, with that threat apparently diminished, corporate involvement in MCC depends on more tangible rewards. </TEXT></DOC>
