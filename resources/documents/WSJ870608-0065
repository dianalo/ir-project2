Picture this:    &quot;Martina Navratilova showed a judge that she wants windshield wipers as rain interrupted her semifinal match in the French Tennis Open Thursday.&quot;    The readers of the 180,000-circulation Herald Tribune were stumped when mystery captions like the above appeared under 13 big white rectangles where the photographs were supposed to be. Photo engravers took a one-night &quot;job action&quot; Thursday, for reasons that the Herald Tribune won't be specific about.    &quot;It was a question of who does a certain job when someone is not around,&quot; says John Vinocur, executive editor of the Paris-based daily, jointly owned by the New York Times, the Washington Post and Whitney Communications.    &quot;The job action came very late in the production process,&quot; Mr. Vinocur said, &quot;and we were hopeful until the very last minute that we would convince the people who had a problem that they didn't have a problem.&quot; Union officials couldn't be reached yesterday for comment.    Readers were left to puzzle out where the Palk Strait was, how a popular new T-shirt appears on teen-agers in West Berlin, and what Saul Bellow looks like when he says, &quot;Ordinary people can still see 'King Lear' and weep.&quot;    Readers might have had better luck visualizing the missing action on the sports page. States one caption: &quot;Jeff Reed, Montreal's catcher, just misses a foul tip off the bat of the Padres' John Kruk.&quot;    West Germany's weighty chancellor Helmut Kohl and two top aides made the biggest hole: 35 square inches on the top of the front page. Vice President George Bush merited a void barely big enough for a large postage stamp.    And Elliot Abrams, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American Affairs who testified before the congressional Iran-Contra hearings last week, missed his chance to have his face on the front page.    Things were back to normal in the Herald Tribune's weekend edition, but Ms. Navratilova's signal for windshield wipers remains a mystery. Copies of the phantom photos weren't made available.    Mr. Vinocur reports no reaction from either subscribers or advertisers. </TEXT></DOC>
