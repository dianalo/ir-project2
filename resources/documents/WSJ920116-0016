Crude oil futures rose about 40 cents a barrel in Londonand New York after Jibril Aminu, the Nigerian oil ministerand OPEC's president, said Nigeria is considering aproduction cut.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for Februarydelivery rebounded from Tuesday's losses to settle 38 centshigher at $18.85 a barrel. March crude was up 39 cents to $19a barrel.   Still, oil markets were whipsawed, particularly in Europe,where prices were headed lower in early trading. Analystssaid the catalyst for the rally apparently was the reportquoting Mr. Aminu, renamed Nigerian oil minister last weekafter a recent cabinet shake-up.   In the interview with Dow Jones International PetroleumReport, Mr. Aminu didn't say how much production may bereduced. &quot;We are working on that,&quot; he said. But he said itwould be &quot;quite reasonable.&quot; Nigeria is currently producingnearly 1.9 million barrels a day.   Any reduction by Nigeria would follow cuts taken byVenezuela, which has reduced its output a token 50,000barrels a day, and by Libya, which announced plans to trimoutput some 30,000 barrels a day. Also, analysts suggested amove by Nigeria could add momentum to the effort by some oilministers toward OPEC-wide cuts to prop up oil prices.   Mr. Aminu said he had &quot;talked to other OPEC ministers&quot; onthe subject and that they are studying actions which may betaken. The ministers are scheduled to meet Feb. 12 in Genevato review oil markets and production levels. Also, CelestinoArmas, the Venezuelan minister, said yesterday that hebelieves OPEC members will be able to reach a consensus toreduce production and stabilize prices.   What action may be taken by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leadingproducer, remains the major question. But Bahman Kabassioun,a Vienna-based consultant on OPEC affairs, expects the Saudisto agree to production cuts so long as they areacross-the-board and don't take effect until the secondquarter, when oil demand slackens seasonally. &quot;In general,OPEC has no option but to cut back,&quot; he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The outlook for tight crop suppliesthis year continued to fuel a rally in wheat futures prices.Prices of soybean and corn futures contracts also climbedyesterday amid signs of heavy buying by commodity fundmanagers. Crop prices faltered at the open of trading at theChicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the former Sovietrepublics might not begin repaying grain-buying loans thatare guaranteed by the U.S. government. The former Sovietrepublics are slated to begin repaying the loans tomorrow.Traders shrugged off the rumors by late in the session, whenprices soared amid speculation that a large amount of grainis being prepared for export from Gulf of Mexico ports. Intrading at the Kansas City Board of Trade, the hard redwinter wheat contract for March delivery rose 4.75 cents abushel to settle at $4.1375 a bushel. The Chicago Board ofTrade announced that trading in its wheat futures options hita daily record of 10,259 contracts on Monday.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended mixed. Silver forJanuary delivery finished 6.1 cents an ounce higher at$4.137; the actively traded March contract rose 6 cents to$4.16. After rising earlier in the day, the actively tradedFebruary gold contract finished 50 cents an ounce lower at$354.70. Analysts attributed the strength in silver tobuying, particularly by overseas investors, based ontechnical factors. Ian MacDonald, vice president of preciousmetals at Credit Suisse, said traders had been verypessimistic about gold and silver's outlook last week andstrongly believed prices were headed lower. But when thatdidn't happen, he said, traders bought contracts to offsettheir short positions, or bets the price will fall. There hasalso been some buying based on a strategy of betting silverprices will rise and gold prices will fall, an analyst said.Playing that gold-silver spread is based on the belief thatan economic recovery will benefit silver more, he said.Silver is used heavily in industries such as photography andelectronics.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rallied. Copper for Januarydelivery rose 1.3 cents a pound to 95.40 cents, while theactively traded March contract advanced 1.15 cents a pound to95.85 cents. John Gross, a West Nyack, N.Y., metalsconsultant, attributed the move to a &quot;technical correction&quot;after the sharp decline of recent weeks. Mike Frawley, metalstrader at Dean Witter in New York, said prices are beingbolstered by short covering and buying by domestic and Asiancopper users. Traders cover their short positions by buyingoffsetting contracts. Mr. Gross said inventories are stillquite low in the U.S. and any pickup in demand will quicklyshow itself in new orders to suppliers. People don'tnecessarily expect such a pickup soon, he said, but added,&quot;If we continue to view the stock market as a leadingindicator {of the economy}, one has to be optimistic.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
