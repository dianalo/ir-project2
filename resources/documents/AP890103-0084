(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker returned to the TV pulpit withhis wife for the first time in two years, and blamed his downfalland subsequent indictment on Satan, not on PTL's sex-and-moneyscandal.   ``I believe the devil said, `I have to smash Jim and TammyBakker,''' he told viewers Monday on the first broadcast of ``TheJim and Tammy Show.''   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, made no direct pitch forcontributions Monday but on this morning's show Bakker promised abook in exchange for donations. The hourlong program is scheduled torun five days a week.   ``We don't want to raise funds on this program every day,''Bakker said today, adding that ``for everyone who sends $100, or $25or more, I want you to have a copy of this `Crisis Book ofScripture.''' The book contains biblical quotations that can helpreaders deal with life crises such as divorce, he said.   ``We're still believing God will restore Heritage (USA) totallyand back to the lifetime members who built it,'' Bakker said.   The broadcasts originated in the living room of the Bakkers'borrowed home and was sent by satellite to a half-dozen stations,mostly cable, in California, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania andLouisiana, Bakker said.   ``Jim, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,''Mrs. Bakker said as the show began Monday. She wore her trademarkheavy eye makeup and broke into tears two minutes into the hourlongshow.   Bakker, 49, and a former top associate were indicted last monthon charges of diverting $4 million in PTL money for their benefit.   The Bakkers had not preached together on television since January1987. Two months later, allegations surfaced of his 1980 sexualencounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Bakker said his last television show at PTL featured thegroundbreaking for the Crystal Palace Church, a proposed 30,000-seatchurch at PTL's Heritage USA. The church was never built and afederal bankruptcy court last month approved the sale of HeritageUSA to a Canadian businessman.   Bakker, however, holding a drawing of the glass church, said hehad not given up.   ``I believe that someday we will still build it,'' Bakker said.``I believe that was the last straw for Satan. I think the devil wasmad that something so beautiful was being built.''   Callers to a ``prayer line'' telephone number Monday _ nottoll-free _ were asked to give their name and prayer request butwere not asked directly for funds.   Bakker frequently referred to the family's recent experience.   ``You can make it,'' he said. ``If Jim and Tammy can survivetheir holocaust of two years, I know God will help you to survive.There's times when I did not want to live. There's times when Iprayed to die. But I know this: God was always there.''   It is unknown yet how many people watched the show.   ``We honestly don't know how many may be carrying it or portionsof it today, because it simply went up on the satellite,'' said theBakker's attorney, Jim Toms.   One city Bakker named as receiving Monday's broadcast did not.   Steve Burleson, president of Asheville Christian Cable Network,said he didn't carry the program and hasn't decided whether totelevise it.   ``I'm all for presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I'msimply not interested in another wall-to-wall begging program,'' hesaid. ``And I think that's the consensus of the viewers here.''</TEXT></DOC>
