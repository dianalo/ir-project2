AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mexico reacted angrily Friday to the U.S.Senate's decision to impose trade and economic sanctions on Mexicofor not doing enough to fight the drug trade.   However, Mexican officials expressed confidence that PresidentReagan will veto the sanctions if they are passed by the House ofRepresentatives.   The Foreign Ministry called the U.S. Senate vote an``intervention'' and said in a formal protest ``no power can claimfor itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies orgovernments. No one has the right to impose from abroad conduct,ideas, political or economic systems on other peoples.''   On Friday in Washington, the U.S. State Department warned thatthe Senate vote to impose sanctions on Mexico actually could leadto an increase in such traffic.   ``Far from serving as a catalyst for action, this votecastigates a friend for less than perfect behavior,'' departmentspokesman Charles Redman said.   The Mexican government places the fight against the drug tradeunder the joint command of the Defense Department and the FederalAttorney General's Office. It also cooperates with the U.S. DrugEnforcement Administration, which maintains an office and agentshere.   The Senate decision did not surprise Mexican officials, but manysaid they were disappointed.   Mexican officials have often been singled out in the UnitedStates by politicians and news media as corrupt and accused ofparticipating in or permitting drug traffic.   The Attorney General's Office, which says it has lost more than30 agents in battles with drug traffickers in the past three years,issued a stronger statement saying the sacrifice of those who losttheir lives ``does not appear to interest those who condemn aneffort they are ignorant of or prefer to remain ignorant of.''   It said thousands of Mexicans risk their lives fighting the drugtrade and added, ``All of this is not understood by those whoshould recognize the work that our country has undertaken toprotect the lives and health of our own population and of othercommunities, particularly in the United States.''   Mexican officials have tried in the past to avoid directconfrontation and the exchange of recriminations about who doesmore in the fight against drug trafficking.   Mexicans believe that U.S. politicians and congressmen often usethe drug traffic issue and Mexico as a way to grab the spotlightand gain publicity.   Juan Enriquez, spokesman for Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the manvirtually certain to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid inDecember, said Friday: ``We are convinced that we must use all ofthe power of the Mexican state to fight against production andtransport of drugs not only because this hurts some people in theUnited States but because of the damages it can a cause in Mexico.''   ``But fighting drugs requires the closest collaboration andshould not be an used for political oportunism or grandstanding,''he said   Salinas de Gortari has said during his campaign that heconsiders the fight against drugs ``a national priority.''   But he also said recently, ``No country has the political, moralor judicial authority to grant certificates of good or bad conductto other countries.''   Two months ago Reagan told de la Madrid at their meeting in thePacific resort of Mazatlan that he had strived for an ``atmosphereof cordiality and mutual respect between the two countries.''   Reagan also praised Mexico's efforts in the war against drugtraffic, and he listened to de la Madrid's reminder of thepervasive Mexican view that drug consumption in the United Statesis as much a part of the problem as production, supply andtrafficking in illicit narcotics.   ``This final link (consumption in the United States) continuesto have a determining influence in the criminal chain,'' de laMadrid told Reagan at their meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
