(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mother of 7-month-old twins conceivedunder contract has agreed to relinquish custody of the children totheir father and avoid a court battle.   Laurie and Richard Yates decided to let Barry and Glinda Huberof Jonesboro, Ark., have permanent custody of the twins, lawyerKathleen Boyle, who represented the Hubers, said.   ``It was probably the ultimate act of love on Laurie Yates'part,'' attorney Robert MacAlpine, who negotiated the settlementfor the Yateses, said Wednesday.   ``They realized that in their precarious financial conditionthey could never provide the kind of home for the twins that theHubers could,'' he said. Both Laurie and Richard Yates, of Ithaca,are unemployed.   Noel Keane, the Dearborn attorney who arranged the contract thatled to the twins' birth, said he believed the babies ``ended upwhere they should and where I think would be obviously in theirbest interest.''   The Hubers paid Keane $10,000 for matching them up with Mrs.Yates and arranging for her to be inseminated with Huber's sperm.   There was no payment to Mrs. Yates, Boyle and MacAlpine said.   The custody agreement was approved late Tuesday by Circuit JudgeTimothy Green, who voided the surrogate parenting contract lastJanuary, calling it unenforceable and contrary to public policy.   A trial to determine which couple should be awarded custody wasscheduled to begin next week.   Under the agreement, the birth certificates of the children,born Sept. 4, 1987, will be changed to give them the surname ofHuber, Boyle and MacAlpine said. Their first names will remainStephanie and Anthony, MacAlpine said.   The Yates couple's decision was influenced in part by reports ofa psychologist and psychiatrist who both concluded the Hubers werethe better choice to raise the twins, according to Lisa Vogler, theYateses' attorney.   Briefs filed in the case showed that Mrs. Yates once pleadedguilty to receiving stolen property and that her husband was twiceconvicted for operating a motor vehicle under the influence ofalcohol.   In contrast, the Arkansas farm couple was portrayed as ``stable,loving and hardworking ... with no history of criminal activity ordrug or alcohol abuse.''   Mrs. Yates, who filed her custody suit before the twins wereborn, has actively supported a drive to outlaw commercialsurrogacy, appearing at news conferences, testifying beforelegislative committees, telling her story on television interviewshows.   Good Housekeeping magazine paid $25,000 to Mrs. Yates' legaldefense fund for rights to her story.   Under the terms of the court order, part of that money will beused to reimburse the state for the cost of the twins' delivery,which was paid through the Medicaid program.</TEXT></DOC>
