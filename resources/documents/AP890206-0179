A week after the arctic air that stunned Alaska crossed Canadainto the Lower 48, thermometers dropped to 49 degrees below zero atCraig, Colo., with an unofficial minus 52 at nearby Hayden, Colo.,and San Francisco hit a low of 31 degrees, lowest for February sincerecord-keeping began in 1872.   Icy roads caused accidents and slowed commuters from Texas andMississippi to Kentucky and Pennsylvania to metropolitan New YorkCity.   At least 56 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31,most of them in traffic accidents or from hypothermia. In Austin,Texas, a paraplegic found dead Sunday apparently had gotten out ofhis car and into a wheelchair, which then slid down an icy ramp theman was unable to climb, police said.   In Garden City, Kan., a couple and two of their children diedMonday in an early-morning mobile home fire that started when anelectric blanket wrapped around water pipes ignited the underside ofthe trailer, authorities said.   Thirty-three cities posted record low temperatures Monday,according to the National Weather Service. Ely, Nev., dropped to 30below zero, its coldest on record for any date.   Other all-time records were 47 below zero at Roosevelt, Utah,erasing the previous record of 32 below, and 33 below at Richfield,Utah.   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus declared eastern Clark County a weatherdisaster area as ranchers fought to rescue thousands of cattle andsheep buried in snow drifts.   The Civil Air Patrol discovered Al Laird's herd of 980 sheepburied in drifts as deep as 15 feet. Laird's wife, Pearl, said thefamily may be able to save 150 of them.   Four-wheel-drive vehicles were used Monday to rescue more than 20people from a hilltop country club near Austin, Texas, where theyhad been stranded since Saturday by icy roads. Humane Societymembers had gone to the Barton Creek Country Club on Saturday for afundraiser, said Michele Kaufman, chairwoman of the event.   ``We had a great time and raised a lot of money,'' Ms. Kaufmansaid.   Stuck at the country club with them was an owl, a falcon, aturtle weighing several hundred pounds and Peter Gros of ``Mutual ofOmaha's Wild Kingdom.''   Freezing rain was reported early Monday across the Easternseaboard and south and west across Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee,Mississippi and into the Texas Gulf Coast and central Texas.Baltimore police were told to respond only to emergency callsbecause even their cars were sliding into curbs and posts.   Northern and central Mississippi had power outages, downed treesand mounting traffic accidents, and ice closed major bridges andfallen trees blocked some secondary roads.   ``We've got a solid sheet of ice, and there's little chance ofrelief,'' said John Prather, a spokesman for the Mississippi HighwayPatrol office at Batesville.   Schools and numerous businesses were closed as far south as theJackson area of central Mississippi by icy roads and power outages.   Heavy snow closed parts of highways Monday in northern andcentral New Mexico, caused scattered power outages and closedschools in more than a dozen towns.   ``I don't think we've ever had a bigger storm,'' said JudyMiller, owner of the Enchanted Forest Cross Country Ski Area at RedRiver, which got 2 feet of snow. ``This is the first time in 25years that we've had to close our ski area down because of theweather.''   The Red River ski area in northern New Mexico got 7 feet of snowover the weekend, mostly on Sunday, and the nearby Angel Fire resortgot 6 feet, according to the Ski New Mexico agency.   On Sunday, wind estimated at 80 mph blew railroad cars off tracksnear Abo, N.M., west of Mountainair, said Santa Fe Railwaysuperintendent John Ish. No injuries were reported, Ish said.   About 20 school districts in northern Texas were closed Mondayafter the Lone Star Gas Co. enacted emergency natural gasconservation measures to ensure sufficient supplies for home andbusiness heat.   Natural gas problems also affected Las Vegas. The record-tyinglow of 19 degrees at Las Vegas coincided with a malfunction in acompressor station, and Southwest Gas Co. officials issued an urgentplea Monday for people to cut back on gas use or to expect forcedreductions. It also cut off service to some large industrialcustomers; large hotels were expected to switch to auxiliary fuelsuch as oil.   More than 6 inches of snow fell on much of Illinois, providingsome encouragement for farmers who feared the shortage of wintermoisture was a harbinger of another drought.   ``The farmers are looking for this _ this is like money in thebank for them,'' said meteorologist Frank Wachowski of the NationalWeather Service.   But the snowfall also caused headaches for Chicago's Street andSanitation Department after 200 backup workers didn't respond tomessages left on answering machines or with relatives over theweekend. Officials made plans to discipline the workers.   Major city school districts in Oregon opened their doors Mondayfor the first time since Tuesday as temperatures moderated, but thewarming trend was potentially bad news for boat owners.   Deputy Dennis Stewart of the Multnomah County sheriff's officeRiver Patrol said pleasure boats and houseboats on the Columbia andWillamette rivers ``are all frozen in now, but they will sink whenit thaws.''</TEXT></DOC>
