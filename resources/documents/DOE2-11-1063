<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-1063 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two sets of coal samples were collected from the No. 3 bed in the UsibelliCoal Mine, Nenana coal field, Healy, Alaska, and were analyzed for major-,minor-, and trace element contents. The coal was sampled in 4.5 footvertical increments at two locations, 200 feet apart. Four benches werecollected at each site and the total thickness of 18 feet representsthe entire bed thickness at these locations. The coal, which is subbituminousC, is overlain by a poorly consolidated fluvial sandstone (approximately60 feet thick) which is light gray above the first channel (locationA) and yellowish brown above the second channel (location B). The meansulfur content of this coal is extremely low (0.12%) with the highestcontent in the upper 4.5 foot interval of the bed at location A and inthe upper 9.0 foot interval at location B. The contents of Si, Al, K,Ti, Mg, Mn, La, and Li show a high correlation with the ash content (correlationcoefficients andgt;0.7) and are higher in the upper and lower intervals atlocation A and higher only in the upper interval at location B. Theseelements are probably associated with aluminosilicates and/or stableoxides dispersed within the coal and may result from detrital influxduring the beginning and ending stages of peat formation. In contrast,the contents of Be, Cr, Mo, Nb, Sc, V, Yb, and Y are anomalously higher(2-400 times) in the upper interval of the bed at location B when comparedto the upper interval of the bed at location A. These elements show nocorrelation with ash content and may have been transported by oxygenatedsolutions moving through the overlying sandstone. They were probablyremoved from solution by the interaction of ground water with the upperportion of the coal. 19 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
