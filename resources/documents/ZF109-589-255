with the new conversion path, customers can take an Actel arraydesign and convert it to an LSI Logic gate array via a functional translationof Actel designs into a format that is readily accepted by LSI's ModularDesign Environment in a procedure that takes less than 10 minutes andsupports the conversion of both single and multiple Actel arrays.andM;- o -andM;K andamp;

by 8&quot; colour active matrix liquid crystaldiode displays to replace the cathode ray tubes that have traditionally beenused, reducing the power requirement, eliminate the need for cooling fans aswell as reducing the weight;
