Republicans were almost unanimous in opposition as the HouseAppropriations Committee approved, 32-20, a catchall bill thatwould keep government operations going for an additional 20 days -until Oct. 20 - to provide more time for negotiatiors to reach anagreement on deficit reduction.   In an effort to discourage President Bush's promised veto, thecommittee attached to the bill an additional $2.1 billion tofinance U.S. participation in Operation Desert Shield in thePersian Gulf.   ``Why hold American troops in Saudi Arabia hostage?'' demandedRep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla. ``This (the Desert Shield money) won'tprotect it. The president does intend to veto it.''   The legislation would double - to 12 months - the time for whichthe president may call up reserves for the Middle East operation.   The committee sidestepped another major foreign policy question,Bush's proposal to forgive $6.7 billion worth of Egyptian debt inappreciation of Egypt's assistance in the Persian Gulf.   Amid indications the committee would have refused to forgive thedebt. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., offered - and the panel approved -an amendment that would allow aid to Egypt to continue despite afailure to repay past assistance.   Stripped from the legislation - known as a continuing resolution- was a section aimed at discouraging the National Endowment forthe Arts from supporting ``any indecent, anti-religious or obscenepicture, play or writing.''   Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the committee, saidfailure of Congress to block arbitrary spending cuts due to takeeffect next week would ``bring the economy to its knees ... Wecan't afford the risk.''   Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, senior Republican on thepanel, said one extension of the deadline would only lead toanother delay. ``A full-blown crisis'' may be the only way to forcea deficit reduction, he said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater repeated today that Bushwould veto any legislation that would delay across-the-boardspending reductions. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., andother Democratic leaders are urging an extension in hopes ofresolving the year-long budget stalemate.   The cuts - called a ``sequester'' - will take place unless thetargets of the Gramm-Rudman law are modified or delayed and willmean across-the-board reductions of up to 40 percent throughout thegovernment.   ``We want to avoid a sequester. We are willing to negotiate intothe night,'' Fitzwater said.   He was asked about reports that one immediate impact of thespending cuts would be the cancellation beginning Monday of allU.S. commercial flights after 6 p.m.   The flights would be cancelled because of sharp cutbacks in airtraffic controllers and in evening operation of U.S. weatherforecasting stations.   ``We're concerned about it, just like we're concerned about allthe cuts,'' Fitzwater said. ``But if you think this seemsdraconian, you ain't seen nothing yet. You're going to see a lotmore dramatic and difficult things to deal with than nightflights.''   Negotiators from the two sides met in a back room of the Capitoluntil nearly 12:30 a.m. today, emerging to say they were stillsearching for a deal.   ``We're making progress in cutting spending, but we're not quitethere,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters.   The major sticking point to a five-year, $500 billiondeficit-reduction deal has been over whether to slash the tax rateon capital gains, the profits from the sale of investments. Bushsays the reduction would boost the economy. Democrats, insistingthe break would aid the wealthy, have refused to accept it withouta compensating tax increase on upper-income people.   The seemingly endless negotiations have left the governmentstaring at the start of the new fiscal year next Monday with nobudget, spending bills or other fiscal legislation in place.   ``It's a game of chicken, that's all it is,'' said Rep. SilvioConte, R-Mass., who was a negotiator from May until topcongressional leaders took over last week.   To prevent a complete government shutdown, the Democrats whocontrol Congress planned to begin working on a bill that wouldtemporarily finance the government through Oct. 20. The date waschosen to give budget bargainers a chance to work out a pact andenact it into law.   ``If you get into the business of suspending and suspending andsuspending ... we'll be at it for 114 years,'' said budget directorRichard Darman.   The same legislation is expected to provide about $2 billiontoward the expenses of Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. militarydeployment in the Middle East.   Unless some combination of tax increases and spending cuts arefound, the fiscal 1991 deficit is expected to exceed a record $250billion in a budget of about $1.2 trillion.</TEXT></DOC>
