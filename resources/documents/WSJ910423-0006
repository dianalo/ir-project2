The faded hope consists of a large, dusty video screenwith loose wires sticking out. Until a few months ago,Thomson engineers hoped to make it the world's most advancedvideo monitor, with an image far sharper than that ofhigh-definition television. They foresaw uses in military andcivilian air-traffic control, and perhaps in medical imagingand even animated-movie production.</LP><TEXT>   But state-controlled Thomson-CSF, Europe's biggestmilitary electronics company, killed the project last year,even though development was almost complete. The high-techscreen was a casualty not of any shooting war but of astruggle ravaging arms merchants: the war on costs.   Despite the Persian Gulf war, governments throughout theWestern world are cutting their arms budgets, egged on by theapparently declining Soviet threat. As their lifebloodevaporates, European arms makers are struggling to cut theirown spending while somehow keeping up technology. Theirefforts, often initiated several years ago, are batteringmorale and killing projects once considered essential.   U.S. aerospace companies have been through such recessionsbefore, as U.S. military and space programs waxed and waned.European companies scoffed at short-sighted U.S. procurementstyle. But now the Europeans too are discontinuing projects,laying off people, rethinking strategies and seeking newmarkets.   &quot;Three or four years ago, we had a less realisticdevelopment strategy,&quot; says Jean-Louis Malgrange, who runsthe Thomson plant that axed the video screen because itdidn't produce orders fast enough. &quot;We had good ideas andthought they automatically would generate sales. We don'toperate that way anymore. Shrinking markets have forced us tobe more selective.&quot;   These days Mr. Malgrange, who oversees all Thomsonproduction of computers and related material, cuts more than200 employees from his staff each year, a steady drain thatthreatens morale. He hopes eventually to stop the hemorrhageby developing civilian markets -- and by using new planningmethods to focus research on the most salable projects.   Across Europe, other arms makers are doing the same.British Aerospace PLC last month announced 2,200 job cuts inits missile division, bringing to 7,200 its military-relatedjob cuts announced since late last year. GEC-Marconi Ltd.,the defense arm of Britain's General Electric Co. (norelation to the similarly named U.S. company) and aerospaceand electronics concern Dowty Group PLC also have announcedlayoffs.   And they all are trying to beat at least some swords intoplowshares. GEC-Marconi uses electronic-warfare technology tomake satellite TV dishes, and transfers rocket-stabilizingexpertise to cars. Its civilian sales climbed to about 30% ofrevenue, from 20% two years ago.   British Aerospace boosted civilian sales to 56% of revenuelast year from one-third in 1988 -- largely through the 1988purchase of auto maker Rover Group PLC. British Aerospace isalso moving into construction and real estate. DeutscheAerospace AG, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, aims to pushcivilian sales as high as 75% of revenue within five to eightyears, from just over half today.   Thomson-CSF, with civilian sales at just 23% of revenue,is going through a similar exercise. The company, 60%-ownedby state-owned electronics giant Thomson S.A., specializes inradar, fighter-plane cockpits, battlefield-communicationsgear, weapons-guidance systems and other militaryelectronics. Based on military contracts, Thomson-CSF hasposted a steady profit in recent years.   Thomson-CSF said Friday it expects net profit to rise thisyear, thanks to an improved financial situation and lowerrestructuring charges. But Chairman Alain Gomez said thegroup's revenue is likely to fall 6% to 8% this year, partlyreflecting fewer orders from the Middle East.   Thomson-CSF posted a 17% drop in 1990 net profit to 2.18billion French francs ($371.7 million), weighed down by agroup restructuring charge of 1.1 billion francs.Consolidated revenue was 37.02 billion francs, a 10% rise.   Not entirely coincidentally, it was at the end of 1989that Thomson-CSF decided to launch its current cutbacks --just as the Berlin Wall opened. Realizing that defensebudgets would topple, too, &quot;we decided to begin our companyreorganization in February&quot; of 1990, says Bernard Cambier,Thomson-CSF's operations chief, who was put in charge of therestructuring.   Mr. Cambier's team devised a worstcase scenario underwhich Thomson's military sales might fall as much as 15% ininflation-adjusted terms by 1993. The group designed a planto boost real profits 10% during the period. The plan:   -- Grow through acquisition, in effect buying marketshare.   -- Shift sales toward Europe and Asia and away from suchMiddle Eastern markets as Iraq, which once were Thomson'sspecialty.   -- Develop civilian spinoff business.   -- Cut costs to the bone.   Among the most battered of Thomson-CSF's activities isradar production, hurt by slumping sales for DassaultAviation S.A.'s fighter jets. Thomson, which makes many ofthe Mirage's electronic instruments, calculates thatelectronics represent 30% of a jet fighter's cost, up from 5%in 1971. The same is true for many weapons, such as tanks.   Mr. Malgrange's computer operations also have beenseriously battered. He has been fighting an increasinglytough sales battle with non-military computer companies.Until the mid-1980s, military computers, used for suchtop-secret tasks as launching nuclear missiles and huntingenemy submarines, were made mainly by specialists such asThomson-CSF. Governments insisted on tailor-building machinesrun by secret military software.   But as computers got more expensive and sophisticated,armies could no longer pay to duplicate what civiliancomputer companies were doing. Military computer makers beganbuying civilian circuit boards and adapting civiliansoftware. Divisions such as Mr. Malgrange's suddenly foundthemselves under pressure to produce as cheaply as DigitalEquipment Corp. or International Business Machines Corp. Ifthey couldn't, procurement people told them just to buycivilian material.   With more and more gear coming from subcontractors, thecomputer hardware staff is projected to hit 1,281 at the endof 1993, down from 2,600 in early 1987. Mr. Cambier has givenThomson researchers three years to totally standardize theirmethods -- so that they all use compatible software andsystems. They also are required to put information on eachresearch project into a central data base. In theory,projects duplicating one another no longer are permitted, andrelated projects are grouped together.   Each research proposal must include an estimate ofpotential sales. It is the sort of blue-pencil control thatresearchers hate. But Mr. Cambier is convinced this systemcan increase research volume while cutting research spending.   The company also is seeking new markets -- military andcivilian. Though it lagged behind some European competitors,Thomson-CSF now produces civilian air-traffic controlequipment, flight simulators and computerized brakes forAirbus jets.   Thomson's Chairman Gomez says he expects Western defensespending to rise again late in the 1990s, as regional threatsreplace worries about the Soviets. But other defensespecialists say spending never will return to Cold Warlevels, meaning that people like Mr. Cambier and Mr.Malgrange could be cutting budgets for some time to come.</TEXT></DOC>
