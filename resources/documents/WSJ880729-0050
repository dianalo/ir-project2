Riding a wave of commercial demand, the dollar reached 1.8680 marks before New York dealers reported in the early afternoon that the U.S. central bank was selling dollars for marks in the open market at the 1.8665-mark level.    Rumors circulating in the market that the Fed had sold dollars for marks a second time at the 1.8625-mark level weren't substantiated.    The reports caused the dollar to retreat to around 1.8610 marks before late buying in New York -- which dealers attributed to end-of-the-month position-squaring -- helped it regain strength.    In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8665 marks, up from 1.8480 marks in New York late Wednesday. The dollar was changing hands at 132.68 yen, above 131.66 yen Wednesday.    In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 132.60, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 132.10.    The U.S. currency's strong advance against the mark yesterday came despite news that the West German Bundesbank raised its key Lombard lending rate half a percentage point to 5%, effective today. The Lombard is the lending window of last resort for the German banking system, and its rate serves as the upper reference point for money market interest rates.    Traders said the Bundesbank rate increase was expected and already had been discounted by the market.    Dealers in New York agree that the dollar's sharp decline Wednesday, following news of a lower-than-expected 3.1% U.S. annual growth rate for the second quarter and reports of intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank, belied the market's basic confidence in the U.S. currency.    They say a closer examination of the GNP figures shows the dollar has fundamental support, and, as a result, demand for the currency continues to grow.    Dealers say the central banks are preventing the dollar from cruising above 1.9000 marks, but a bullish U.S. trade report next month could easily cause the ceiling to be broken.    Remarks from Fed Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in testimony before the U.S. House Banking Committee yesterday elicited little response from the market.    Mr. Greenspan said an appreciation of the U.S. unit would be counterproductive to resolving major trade imbalances. He also indicated strong opposition to any substantial decline in the dollar from around prevailing levels.    Dealers said the chairman's statements tended to confirm market sentiment that the Fed wants to contain the dollar in a trading range between 1.8200 marks and 1.8900 marks.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $432.50 an ounce, down 80 cents. Estimated volume was a heavy 6.5 million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, July 28, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
