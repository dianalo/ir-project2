Topsoil depth and irrigationrate were evaluated for their influence on the concentration and locationof salts in the profile. Four irrigation rates and four topsoil depthsover coal spoil were tested in soil lysimeters in a greenhouse. Waterwas added weekly for 6 summer months (4 in one year, 2 in next). Afterthe final irrigation the cylinders were cut open lengthwise and the profilesampled every 10 cm. The current depth of the wetting front and/or anyalteration due to wetting was recorded. Samples from before and afterthe study were analyzed for EC, soluble and extractable Na, Ca, Mg andthe sodium absorption ratio (SAR) computed. Small increases in SAR andEC were found in the topsoil for most combinations of topsoil depth andwatering rate. The most consistent increases were associated with theshallowest depth of topsoil (10 cm). Sodium and other electrolytes accumulatedin one case in the 10 cm layer just above the spoil and again at thesurface. Both diffusion of salts from the spoil and convection of saltsto the surface are possible explanations. The small increases in saltsin the topsoil were well within the salt tolerance of native plants.Although salt migration into reclaimed topsoil from saline-sodic spoilis a possibility, its effect on plant growth is likely minimal.</TEXT></DOC>
