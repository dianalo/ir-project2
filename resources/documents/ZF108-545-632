(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Optical StorageandM;The federal government has taken the lead in exploring both large- andsmall-format optical storage technologies.andP;  The Patent and Trademark Office,Census Bureau, Internal Revenue Service and NASA became early sponsors ofoptical pilot projects.andP;  Many smaller agencies discovered they coulddistribute and store reams of documents economically on a single 600M CD-ROMdisk.andM;Now agencies are beginning to put new archival applications onto writablemedia -- either write-once/read-many (WORM) platters or erasables that can bewritten over and over.andM;Although writable drives cost considerably more than CD-ROM, they showgreater promise for the future because of their larger capacities andspeedier access times.andM;In the meantime, optical technology itself is about to enter the thirddimension.andP;  Researchers are exploring holographic three-dimensional storagetechniques that could dramatically increase capacity as well as performance.andM;By almost any measure, optical storage promises to become a booming businessin the near future.andP;  Worldwide sales of optical drives by 1995 -- includingCD-ROM, WORM and erasable units -- will exceed $1.8 billion, according toforecasts by Market Intelligence Research Co., Mountain View, Calif.andM;Sales of erasable drives are expected to double, accounting for two-thirds ofthe market, while CD-ROM will drop to a 10 percent share from its presentone-third share.andP;  Market Intelligence predicts WORM drive sales will holdalmost steady, dropping from 33 percent to 25 percent of the market in 1995.andM;Frost andamp; Sullivan Inc., New York City, shows far more optimism, predicting theUnited States optical market alone will reach $4.8 billion by 1993.andM;CD-ROM, because of its lower cost, seems to be the entry point into opticaltechnology for many agencies.andP;  At the Census Bureau, for example, CD-ROM hascreated a new source of revenue besides opening up vast amounts of data.andM;&quot;For the first time, our analysts are getting their hands on large datasets,&quot; said Paul Zeisset, a special assistant on the economic census staff.andO;&quot;They don't have to rely on programmers any more.andP;  One analysts who was usedto printouts discovered how much was on a CD-ROM and immediately printed itall out.andM;&quot;Pretty soon he got the idea -- not to generate stacks of paper moreefficiently, but to get rid of the stacks of paper.&quot;andM;Zeisset said the bureau's CD-ROM publishing effort started small, but soonwill expand with a 40-disk set of geographic data from the 1990 decennialcensus.andM;Census' Topologically Integrated Geographic and Resource database will supplynational geographic data broken down into areas as small as a city block.andO;Zeisset said he expects the set of geographic disks, due between mid-1991 and1993, to become &quot;a great revenue generator&quot; at $250 per disk.andP;  Businesses andgovernments will use them for mapping, routing and land records, he said.andM;Earlier Census CD-ROMs, which replaced paper or computer tape data, include aone-time compilation of counties and cities; a $475 subscription series ofseven CD-ROMs containing the 1987 economic census statistics by industry andlocale; and two $1,200 subscription series, updated monthly, on United Statesexports and foreign imports classified by commodity, origin, port andtransportation mode.andM;The disks can be read from PC-compatible or Macintosh computers under theInternational Standards Organization 9660 standard.andP;  Data is in dBase III+format, which Zeisset called a de facto standard.andM;&quot;We started CD-ROMs in the mid-1980s,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Our test disk had files inASCII, but we soon figured out that was not the way to go.andP;  We didn't want toget into the software business.andP;  The dBase format has been much moresuccessful.&quot;andM;Census employees premaster the data on computer tape and Government PrintingOffice contractors produce the finished CD-ROMs.andM;Accessible CensusandM;Zeisset said one result of the CD-ROM effort has been to make census dataavailable to many new groups such as libraries and state data centers.andM;&quot;When John Q. Business wants information on markets, he doesn't go to theCensus Bureau.andP;  He goes to the local library or trade association,&quot; Zeissetsaid.andM;Larger-scale optical methods are making their way into the front end ofCensus data collection.andM;Barry Cohen, chief of the Economic Programs Division, said, &quot;We're looking toreplace microfilm with optical images of the questionnaires on-line from ajukebox, so the analysts can compare them with the ASCII data.&quot;andM;He explained that the economic and agricultural censuses, comprising about500 paper forms, do not lend themselves to optical character recognition asthe decennial census forms do.andP;  Instead of filling in machine-readablecircles with a pencil, the economic census respondents must write out longnumbers, comments and explanations.andM;Analysts often need to refer to these written comments after they see thenumerical data, which is keyed by data entry personnel from the forms.andP;  Theanalysts now must search for the paper forms or microfilm reels, which takestime.andM;If funds permit, Cohen said, it would be more efficient to forward opticalimages of the questionnaires by electronic mail to the analysts as needed.andO;Census has been testing a basic production system from FileNet Corp., CostaMesa, Calif.andP;  It also has purchased a Terminal Data Corp. scanner, modifiedby FileNet to read the bar-coded identification for each response to theeconomic census.andM;&quot;That means there is no data entry for the index,&quot; Cohen said.andM;He hopes to have a production system working for the next economic census inJanuary 1993.andP;  Other optical vendors under consideration are Eastman KodakCo. and Digital Equipment Corp.andM;The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) began exploring CD-ROM publishingbecause it needed to cut back on-line costs for sending new patentinformation to the nation's 68 patent depository libraries (PDLs).andM;&quot;It got to be too expensive,&quot; said William S. Lawson, PTO administrator fordocumentation.andP;  &quot;We had a CD-ROM pilot that was quite successful, so weextended it to all the PDLs.andP;  We gave them readers, and we update the disksbimonthly.andP;  The on-line savings paid for the equipment.andP;  Now we save about$300,000 a year.&quot;andM;Each PDL received a two-drive NEC America Inc. 286 micro and a printer.andP;  PTOalso has in-house CD-ROM readers from Sony Corp. and Hitachi America Ltd.andM;Other CD-ROMs piloted by PTO include a disk of trademarks, now under test bythe PDLs, and a help disk that holds an assortment of search manuals andindexes formerly distributed on paper or microfilm.andP;  Lawson said these pilotdisks have been well-received by the PDLs and the public.andM;&quot;We do the premastering in-house with CD Publisher software [Meridian DataInc. of Scotts Valley, Calif.], and we have search software from DatawareTechnologies Inc.&quot; of Cambridge, Mass., he said.andP;  &quot;We chose the searchsoftware because it is very intuitive.andP;  We read in the raw data, index it,format it to tape and send it outside for mastering.&quot;andM;PTO pays about $1,100 for mastering each edition, plus about $3 each for arun of 250 disks, which the public can buy.andM;Patent DocumentsandM;While the textual information on the CD-ROMs has proved helpful to patentlawyers and other researchers, Lawson said it would be better to publish theactual patent documents themselves, complete with drawings.andM;However, that will have to await future developments in PTO's grand-scaleoptical Automated Patent System.andP;  All patent documents now are raster-scannedfor APS, so adding the documents to the CD-ROMs would be relatively easy, hesaid.andM;Another area for future expansion is foreign CD-ROM distribution.andP;  PTOalready trades its patent documentation with about 100 other countries.andM;Basically, Lawson said, CD-ROMs are &quot;an electronic publishing medium.andP;  Theirprimary advantage is low cost -- you make one master and then stamp them outlike cookies.&quot;andM;At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Product Centerin Camp Springs, Md., optical storage may not have changed the way data isdistributed, but it has made life considerably more bearable.andM;&quot;We were awash in a sea of floppy disks&quot; before installing rewritable opticaldrives, said oceanographer Walton Campbell.andM;The Ocean Product Center creates and analyzes satellite weather imagery onseveral microcomputers running the Satellite Sea-Surface-Temperature ImageProcessing System, a NOAA-designed software package.andM;More than 10,000 observations an hour pour into the center from ships andweather buoys worldwide.andP;  Oceanographers at the center select observationsfor input to the National Weather Service's forecast.andP;  Each image file,formerly stored on floppy disk, can run as large as 500K.andM;&quot;After a week or two, the files would get dumped, and the disk would be usedagain,&quot; Campbell said.andP;  &quot;That made it difficult to look at what happened lastyear at any particular season.&quot;andM;Campbell switched to the Inspire dual magneto-optic drive unit fromAlphatronix Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.andP;  The drives acceptISO-standard 5-1/4-inch removable, rewritable cartridges holding 650M.andO;Campbell has configured six micros with an Alphatronix interface card so hecan attach the optical drives to the micros as needed.andM;The center also uses MicroVAX IIs to process raw weather observation data forinput into the National Weather Service's forecast models.andP;  A dual-driveoptical system from Alphatronix connected to one of the MicroVAXes serves asa real-time backup.andM;Data is written to the optical disk at the same time it is written to the VAXmagnetic disk.andM;&quot;If we suddenly lose an entire computer, we just pop the optical media out ofthe rewritable, and we're back in business,&quot; Campbell said.andP;  The VAXes can beback up and running after a crash in about two minutes, which he called &quot;aninconvenience but a lot better than a two-hour delay.&quot;andM;In the days before the optical system, he said, &quot;Occasionally we would haveto rip the disk physically out of the VAX that died and reinstall it inanother.andP;  So both systems would have to come completely down.andP;  Screwdriversand wrenches were everywhere.&quot;andM;Days Before OpticalandM;At the Internal Revenue Service, optical storage at local sites is reducingthe demand for mainframe time, particularly during the busy tax-filingseason.andP;  The group that audits the IRS itself is experimenting with smallusable systems to speed up internal review.andM;&quot;Mainframe time is very hard to get,&quot; said Larry Reimer, a programmer at theIRS' Fresno, Calif., inspection service.andP;  &quot;That is how we used to do all ourcomputer runs and reviews of IRS programs.&quot;andM;The Inspection Service at each service center checks up on tax examiners tomake sure audits are carried out properly.andM;&quot;We might want to look at all the examinations that had no change -- noadditional taxes due or no refund to the taxpayer,&quot; Reimer said.andP;  &quot;We wouldselect those records and review them to make sure the audit was conductedproperly, the revenue agent didn't miss any items and procedures werefollowed.&quot;andM;But during tax processing season, computer time grows scarce for anynon-production jobs.andP;  &quot;We are considered support,&quot; Reimer said, &quot;so we getdown toward the bottom in priority.andP;  Some jobs used to sit around for daysjust because there was not time to run them.andP;  The situation was critical herein Fresno and was getting critical in a couple of the other service centers.&quot;andM;Although some centers are considering minicomputers to reduce the load onvaluable mainframe time, Reimer was charged with looking into PCs and opticaltechnology.andM;The prototype system he set up uses a Model 325 25-MHz 386 microcomputer fromDell Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas, connected to a 1-gigabyte Tahitimagneto-optic drive from Storage Dimensions Inc. of San Jose, Calif.andM;Instead of waiting for mainframe processing time, Reimer transfer about 300Mof the mainframe data to optical cartridges and performs the audits with his386 micro.andM;&quot;The optical disk has an access speed that is about the same as a hard[drive] on an IBM AT-class machine,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We're beyond testing now and into actual production.andP;  I decided that if Iwas going to be testing this, I would rather test it in a real-worldsituation&quot; with live data.andM;Reimer pronounced himself &quot;sold&quot; on the technology and believes other servicecenters could benefit as well: &quot;It is a recommendation I would make, but Idon't make the decision.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, those agencies that are just beginning to explore optical storageshould hold on to their hats and prepare to enter the third dimension.andM;Engineers at an Austin, Texas, research facility have been experimenting forseveral years with holographic optical techniques and now are working on afourth-generation prototype capable of storing massive amounts of data inside3-D, photo-refractive crystals of strontium barium niobate.andM;&quot;We're about two years away from delivering a fully functional prototype thatstores digital information as holograms,&quot; said Ron Riedesel, a member of theoptics team at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp. (MCC).andM;&quot;This technology is quite a bit different from optical or magnetictechnologies.andP;  There are no moving parts and zero latency [read/write waitingtime].andP;  The medium is removable for backup or recovery applications and iscapable of being written and rewritten many times.&quot;andM;Although MCC officials would not disclose names of backers, they said sevencorporations from the computer, imaging and aerospace industries aresponsoring the hologram project.andM;&quot;The technology offers density benefits because the material isthree-dimensional--you literally store the information inside a transparentcrystal,&quot; Riedesel said.andP;  &quot;Theoretically, it could deliver much bettr densitythan anything available today.&quot;andM;&quot;The prototype has no moving parts, and its access speed is on the same orderas dynamic RAM, but it has the same capabilities and costs as optical disck,&quot;Riedesel said.andM;An array of magneto-optic deflectors &quot;steers&quot; a laser beam across a mediaarray 3 centimeters square and 0.5 centimeter thick.andP;  Besides projectedcapacity of 2 gigabytes, researchers are shooting for an average transferrate of 100 to 800 megabytes per second.andP;  Riedesel said he expects theresulting commercial product to be &quot;fairly compact, somewhere in the range ofa 3-1/2- to 5-1/4-inch peripheral device.&quot;andM;He predicted holographic storage devices at first will cost at least twice asmuch as equal-capacity optical disks but eventually could deliver storagecapacities of more than 10 gigabytes and average access times inmicroseconds.andM;Will holographic storage replace magnetic media?andM;&quot;For some applications, yes, absolutely,&quot; Riedesel said.andP;  But because of thecost, initial applications probably will be in high-throughput applicationssuch as transaction processing, imaging and graphics.andM;It may take a decade or longer for holographic storage to show up on thedesktop.andM;&quot;I'm a little reluctant to predict that this will replace the magnetic driveindustry, but it certainly could have a majore impact,&quot; Riedesel said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
