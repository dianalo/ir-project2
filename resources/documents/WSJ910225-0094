You thought there was a relationship between atelephone-network construction project in Dodge City, Kan.,and the Bell companies' efforts to seek relief from archaiclines of business restrictions that were imposed on us as theresult of the ATandamp;T breakup. We just don't see that link.</LP><TEXT>   Here's the situation. In response to a customer request,we worked up a bid to add the Dodge City school district toan existing educational video network in southwest Kansas.The bid required us to bury a three-mile fiber-optic cablethat was the best way to deliver video signals. The new fiberfacilities would be used by only the one customer.   The only way the Dodge City case and the appeal forregulatory freedoms are related is by extrapolation: If thecourts had removed restrictions that limit what we can do forcustomers, we might have been able to offer more options inthis case.   We've worked hard with our existing resources to bringmore educational opportunities to schoolchildren in Kansasthrough video services. And we're continuing our talks witheducators in southwest Kansas so perhaps we can help themfind other alternatives.   James W. Callaway   President, Kansas Division   Southwestern Bell Telephone   Topeka, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
