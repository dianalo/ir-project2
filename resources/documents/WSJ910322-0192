When finished the new system will be able to handle morethan 15,000 digital circuits or 80,000 simultaneous telephoneconversations, or the same as TAT-9, and double the capacityof the current TAT-8 system.   In addition, ATandamp;T and Telefonica, which have previouslyannounced joint ventures in microelectronics andtelecommunications equipment, said they will use the newsystem as the first leg in a network of fiber linesconnecting southern Europe to the U.S. via Spain.   An ATandamp;T spokesman said the partners are still trying todecide how to apportion ownership in the cable. Suppliers ofthe system also need to be selected, although much of thecable and transmission electronics will likely be supplied byATandamp;T Network Systems, ATandamp;T's telecommunications equipment armwhose international unit is partially owned by Telefonica andItaltel.   Besides the cable pact, ATandamp;T and Telefonica said theywould begin offering advanced digital voice and datatransmission service for corporations as well as ATandamp;TUSADirect service, which provides callers in Spain with adirect connection to ATandamp;T operators in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
