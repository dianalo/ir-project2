Continuing talks over a possible hike in the official productionceiling came as a new report indicated the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries lifted output in May to its highestlevel of the year, surpassing its current ceiling.   An offical of one delegation said a proposal had been made toraise the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 millionbarrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period.   The additional production would be divided proportionately amongall members, said the official, who demanded anonymity.   Kuwait has insisted on a larger share and several othercountries would like special treatment.   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba told reporters hewanted OPEC to boost its daily production limit to between 20million barrels and 21 million barrels.   The nation persistently has pumped more than its individualquota, although Otaiba refused to say how much he would like of theproposed additional cartel output. ``As much as we can get we wouldlove to have,'' he said.   ``The key issue is to get everybody within the new umbrella of20 or 20 plus (million barrels a day) as a new ceiling,'' saidOtaiba.   Other members have said no country should be given more outputthan others.   Libya's Fawzi Shakshuki said if another country wins ``specialtreatment ...Libya will ask for that.''   The OPEC ministers have been trying to resolve their disputessince last Friday. They opened a formal strategy conference Mondaybefore returning to private bargaining.   OPEC nations agreed last November on a production ceiling of18.5 million barrels a day for the January-June period, well underactual output levels of that time, in an attempt to support a priceof $18 a barrel for their oil.   Prices have risen since then, with the price of a basket ofcrudes monitored by OPEC now more than 40 percent above the levelof late November.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude,closed down 6 cents Tuesday at $20.46 a 42-gallon barrel.   The ministers apparently have settled on retaining the $18benchmark, although Saudi Arabia had recommended scrapping thetarget price.   ``OPEC seems to be happy with a pricing level around $18,'' saidOtaiba.   Separately, the International Energy Agency reported the OPECnations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day inMay to 21 million barrels, the highest amount so far this year.   Higher production by Kuwait and Nigeria accounted for much ofthe May increase, it said.   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report estimated Saudi Arabiaproduced 4.8 million barrels a day in May. Its OPEC-set supplyquota is 4.5 million barrels a day.   Iran and Iraq each produced about 2.8 million barrels a day inMay, it said.   The output for Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates was estimatedat 1.6 million barrels a day, well above their OPEC supply quotasof about a million barrels a day.   Nigeria produced some 1.6 million barrels a day, ahead of itssupply target of about 1.4 million barrels.   The report estimated Venezuela's production at 1.6 millionbarrels a day, the same as its quota, and Ecuador's at 300,000barrels, up from its quota of 230,000 barrels.   Other production estimates were: Libya, 1 million barrels;Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels; Libya, 1million barrels; and Gabon, 200,000 barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
