But only now have engineers begun to develop products using the theory.    Bose, a Framingham, Mass., maker of speakers, is introducing a $965 headset for private airplane pilots that it says reduces noise by more than 93%, compared with regular headphones. Britain's Plessey and Racal Electronics both started selling similar headsets to British tank crews last year.    Noise cancellation eliminates particular sounds by producing a pressure that is the opposite of the undesired noise. In the Bose system, for example, if a loud sound creates pressure on the ear, a diaphragm in the earcup simultaneously decreases pressure, eliminating the sound. The cancellation device can be set to eliminate only unwanted sounds such as an airplane's drone.    Peter Wheeler, Racal's marketing director, thinks the sets are too expensive for consumer or industrial use. But, Dean Kamen, president of Enstrom Helicopter, Menominee, Mich., says Bose headsets will be standard gear on his company's executive helicopters. &quot;They are the largest single improvement to pilot comfort and safety I've seen,&quot; he says.    Some airline passengers may discover the comfort of noise-cancellation devices in an entertainment system Plessey is marketing to commercial airlines. The system will let passengers rent videos, make phone calls, order products from catalogs for delivery on the ground, and listen to music through headsets that eliminate airplane sounds.    British researchers are working to develop four-speaker systems that could cancel the noise inside an entire turboprop plane, Racal's Mr. Wheeler says. They also have studied the possibility of devices on truck tailpipes to augment muffler systems.    Omar Bose started his firm's noise cancellation research project because he was disappointed by the poor quality of music in airline headsets. Today, Mr. Bose uses one of his company's headsets when he flies. He reports that less exposure to unpleasant noises even reduces fatigue and jet lag.    Guess Which Company    Is Most Computerized    PREDICTABLY enough, International Business Machines uses more personal computers than any other company, some 200,000, or one for almost all of its 223,000 workers, according to a Personal Computing Magazine survey.    Outside the computer industry, General Electric is the biggest corporate user with 45,000 systems, or one for every 6.7 workers. That ratio was about average among the 100 biggest users, the magazine says.    Computer ownership patterns proved unpredictable. Ford Motor was the second-biggest computer owner with 42,000 systems. The magazine calculated that Ford had one PC for every 8.5 workers, while General Motors had one for every 24 workers and Chrysler had one for every 18 workers.    Microsoft, the biggest PC software developer, has more than two personal computers for every worker, while Apple Computer has more than one for each employee. Price Waterhouse was the only other company with a computer for each employee.    New Disk Dictionaries    Seek a Bigger Market    COMPUTERIZED spelling checkers and thesauruses are standard additions to many word processors. But complete dictionaries have been slow sellers because of their size.    Now, with capacious hard disks more common and compression techniques still improving, disk dictionaries are seeking to supplant desk dictionaries.    Franklin Computer, Mt. Holly, N.J., is expanding the marketing of a $99 personal-computer version of Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary. Thomas Yianalos, general manager of a Franklin subsidiary, says &quot;a spellchecker, most everyone wants. The dictionary market is limited to people who really care about what they write.&quot;    This month, Houghton-Mifflin started licensing for resale three different electronic versions of its American Heritage dictionary. The biggest, filling six megabytes on a hard disk, will contain the entire American Heritage dictionary including etymology, sample sentences and usage notes.    Franklin's handheld $400 Language Master, which recently went on sale after production delays, not only provides definitions of 80,000 words, but it also pronounces them in a nasal, generally comprehensible voice. Some words, however, such as ankle and angle are indistinguishable.    Michael Weiner, president of Microlytics, Pittsford, N.Y., and SelecTronics, Minneapolis, which make electronic spelling checkers and Bibles, plans to bring out an electronic version of the one-volume Random House encyclopedia next year. It will have a feature called &quot;word-nerd&quot; that can find a word a user can't remember just by knowing the definition.    But no matter what their advantages, the cost of these products and the disk space they need will probably prevent them from cutting into paper dictionary and encyclopedia sales for many years.    Odds and Ends    LET NO MINUTES go unbilled. WordTech Systems, Orinda, Calif., introduces a personal-computer product that sets the clock ticking the moment a lawyer or accountant dials a client. The $299 product also automatically recalls notes taken during previous calls to the same number. . . . Wisdom Simulators, Cambridge, Mass., calls a computerized management-training program on how to handle eager, but inexperienced young employees its &quot;Dan Quayle simulation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
