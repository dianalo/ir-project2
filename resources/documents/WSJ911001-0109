Biotechnology companies last year achieved a long-soughtgoal of inserting new genes into laboratory-grown cornplants. This summer they planted their first field plots ofgenetically altered corn to make sure that the new geneswould function and that genetic manhandling didn't cause anyunwanted changes in the plants.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a bit too early {to assess the field test in detail}since we just harvested our plots three weeks ago and thesamples are still in the lab being analyzed,&quot; says Charles H.Baker, president of BioTechnica International Inc. inOverland Park, Kan. &quot;But it looks like everything turned outas expected,&quot; he says.   Genetic engineers ultimately aim to increase the corncrop's resistance to insects, drought and chemicals and toimprove its nutritional value as livestock feed. Ifsuccessful, the corn experiments could have an economicimpact that would dwarf most other genetic engineering feats.Since the seven billion to 7.5 billion bushels of corn thatU.S. farmers harvest each year are worth $18 billion to $20billion, new genes that can increase per-acre yields by onlya few percent or add a few cents per bushel to prices of cornfor cattle, swine and poultry feed are worth hundreds ofmillions of dollars to farmers.   The stakes also are high for the half-dozen companies nowracing to market genetically modified corn. BesidesBioTechnica these companies include Monsanto Co., PioneerHi-Bred International Inc., DeKalb Genetics Corp. and CibaGeigy Corp. All are fierce competitors for the $1.5 billionthat U.S. farmers spend each year on hybrid corn seed.   Plant geneticists have been improving corn plants sincethe 1920s, but only through tedious years of cross-breedingcorn strains that have desirable genes.   The breakthrough last year, announced by one company afteranother, was the ability to insert new genes directly intoembryonic corn plants without cross-breeding. The newtechnology allows plant scientists to add almost any new geneto a corn plant, including genes from bacteria and from otherplants.   The new gene-inserting technology being used by most ofthe companies was pioneered by Cornell University and wasperfected by Du Pont Co. Known as &quot;microprojectilebombardment,&quot; it is literally a gun that shoots new genesinto the germ cells of corn plants.   While some of the companies experimented only withso-called market genes that confer resistance on anantibiotic or insecticide, Monsanto tested a gene that ithopes will end up in a new commercial strain of corn. Itsexperimental corn plants this summer carried a bacterial genethat produces a natural insecticide, which interferes withthe digestion of corn leaves eaten by the European cornborer, said Michael Fromm, the chemical company's projectleader for corn genetics. Corn borers chomping into leaves ofcorn plants with the new gene should get a lethal dose of theinsecticide, he said.   Monsanto tested gene-altered corn plants in an areaalready infested with the corn borer. The inserted genefunctioned in the field-tested plants, Mr. Fromm said, but heconceded &quot;it didn't work as well as in the laboratory.&quot; Thatis because &quot;the way the insects grow in the field isdifferent&quot; from in the laboratory, he said.   BioTechnica also tested a gene that it hopes to insertinto commercial strains of hybrid corn, Mr. Baker said. Thegene boosts the corn's content of methionine, one of theessential amino acids that are vital components of proteins.   Today's corn, Mr. Baker says, falls short of supplying achicken's daily requirements of methionine. BioTechnica hopesto produce a high-methionine corn that will enable poultrybreeders and growers to reduce or eliminate the need to addsynthetic methionine to their birds' diets, he explains.   Pioneer hopes to begin field tests next season of corncarrying commercially important genes for resistance toinsects and diseases, says John Howard, the company'sdirector of biotechnology.   How long it will be before farmers can plant geneticallyengineered corn is unknown. Pioneer's Mr. Howard guesses itmay take three more years to get new genes into commercialstrains of corn. It then will take four to five years toparlay the new plants into a seed crop large enough for thecompany to begin selling seed to farmers. &quot;My guess is thatthe farmer won't see {genetically engineered corn} before1998,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
