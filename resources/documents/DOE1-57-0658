In this article,these powerful biotechnologies are discussed, with particular emphasison microchemical instrumentation, a major focus of my efforts for thepast 15 years. The author also discusses two fundamental problems inmodern medicine that are being explored in the laboratory using thesetechniques-genetic engineering of the nervous system and the mappingand sequencing of the human genome.</TEXT></DOC>
