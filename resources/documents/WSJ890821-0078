Shares of America West, traded on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, have been given a lift lately by the rosy outlook for the carrier's aircraft-maintenance business.    The takeover speculation boosting all airline issues in recent sessions has been a factor in America West's 25% rise this month. But the stock got a bigger push from Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Helane Becker, who this month raised her short-term rating on the stock to &quot;outperform,&quot; or buy, from &quot;neutral,&quot; or hold, and proclaimed that the company's maintenance center is &quot;one of the major reasons&quot; to own America West. On Friday, the stock closed unchanged at 12.    As Ms. Becker sees it, the route to profit for the Phoenix, Ariz., airline company is lined at least partly with mechanics and paint sprayers. She says revenue at the company's 15-month-old facility for painting planes, checking engines and training pilots will rise handsomely through 1990.    She predicts that America West's revenue from such non-passenger contract businesses will be about $50.7 million, or 5% of its total revenue, this year and $81 million, or nearly 7% of the total, in 1990. Ms. Becker estimates that the facility alone is worth &quot;at least $100 million, or $5.43 a share.&quot;    She expects America West to earn $1.15 a share this year and $1.33 a share in 1990.    Despite such positives, the uncertain economic outlook in the intensely competitive industry makes some analysts wary of airline stocks. Others see clouds on America West's horizon as it attempts to expand beyond its Las Vegas, Nev., and Phoenix hubs.    Mark Daugherty, a Dean Witter analyst who is negative on the group, is advising clients to &quot;sell their airline stocks and use the funds elsewhere.&quot;    Mr. Daugherty says, &quot;The economy is slowing, and air traffic and pricing could come under downward pressure over the next year or two.&quot; Simultaneously, he says, the airlines will have to finance the rapid expansion they've recently embarked upon through aircraft purchases. &quot;That will strain their financial performance,&quot; he says.    Neil Eigen, a portfolio manager at Integrated Resources' Asset Management unit, says regional airline stocks, among which he numbers America West, are the most attractive sector of the industry now. He also likes the prospects for America West's maintenance services business. But he hasn't bought any shares yet, contending that the company's earnings are still &quot;erratic&quot; and that America West officials haven't shown that they can manage the company's growth.    America West's facility can serve 150 planes. The company is hiring more mechanics, which should help it do more contract work, Ms. Becker says -- and the shortage of trained mechanics facing the industry makes the strategy doubly wise, she says.    &quot;Airline companies have expanded rapidly, and the shortage of maintenance facilities has become a world-wide industry problem,&quot; Ms. Becker says. &quot;The carriers with facilities for doing contract maintenance will do the best in the long term.&quot;    In addition, America West's aircraft painting operations make it something of a takeover play, Ms. Becker reasons: The tide of airline mergers and acquisitions over the past three years, and the resulting need for changing planes' names, will provide plenty of work for America West's artisans. A number of big carriers have already approached the company about repainting their fleets, she says.    But as for the possibility of a takeover of America West itself: Insiders and employees own nearly 80% of the shares outstanding, and the company says workers are scheduled to receive payments amounting to 100% of their salaries if there's a hostile takeover. This makes it a less-than-attractive target, analysts say. A group including investor Martin Sosnoff owns an 8.5% stake but has said it's only for investment purposes.    Though many analysts believe America West is turning around after posting a $45.7 million loss for 1987, the company still faces challenges, they say. Last year, it had an operating loss of $12.2 million before a debenture repurchase that resulted in net income of $9.4 million, or 51 cents a share.    Ms. Becker and others are skeptical of the carrier's ability to generate enough revenue to cover the costs of the four Boeing 747s it is buying from KLM Royal Dutch Air over the next year. The company plans to use the planes for the flights to Honolulu it is due to begin in November. But Ms. Becker and others say that Honolulu is a popular but unprofitable market. The Shearson analyst calls it &quot;an expensive experiment&quot; that could hurt profit in the fourth quarter.    Ray Nakano, America West's controller, says service to Hawaii will enhance the company's operating results. &quot;Over the next decade, we feel traffic growth will occur in the Pacific Rim, and we'd like to be a player in that market,&quot; Mr. Nakano says. &quot;Honolulu is the origination point for many flights&quot; to that region.    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.14 to 461.97 on 134.5 million shares.
