The East German government agreed to Bonn's agenda forpolitical unification by proposing Dec. 2 for the first freeelections in a united Germany since 1932, preparing the wayfor this summer's talks to formally end German division. Theproposal was seen in Bonn as a sign that East Berlin'sleadership has overcome internal opposition to a swiftunification process. Bonn had proposed Dec. 2 or Dec. 9 asdates for the all-German vote.</LP><TEXT>   This isn't to say the process will be easy or smooth.Yesterday West Germany's coalition government failed to agreeon a fundamental question: Should the unified elections beheld before, or after, formal German unification?   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union andits Free Democratic Party allies did endorse East Berlin'sDec. 2 proposal for the first free all-German vote since1932. But the Christian Democrats want the two Germanys tohold separate elections on that day, with politicalunification formally taking place at midnight the same day.The Free Democrats are insisting that unification come first,followed by a single election in which all Germans wouldparticipate.   The Free Democrats contend that separate elections wouldhelp the Christian Democrats' political allies in EastGermany, who are more likely to gain the 5% minimum vote inthe polls required for parliamentary representation if theyonly have to compete in East Germany. If unified nationalelections were held, the small East German parties would haveless chance of meeting the 5% minimum.   Meanwhile, a joint commission tomorrow begins negotiatinga second state treaty between the two Germanys. The pact,which would allow the merger of East German states under anarticle in West Germany's Basic Law, would complete aunification process that began when the two nations on Sundayunified their monetary, economic and social systems. Thecostly rescue operation for the crippled East German economywas set down by a treaty ratified by the two Germanparliaments last month.   West German officials have been pressing East Germany toagree to a quick political follow-up to monetary and economicunion to better coordinate East Germany's difficult economicadjustment. In a recent interview, Bonn Economics MinisterHelmut Haussmann said that &quot;from an economic standpoint, afree market can only be brought about under a unitedgovernment and one federal budget.&quot;   West German parties and their East German counterparts arealready preparing to merge by autumn. East German PrimeMinister Lothar de Maiziere has been promised the post ofdeputy chairman of West Germany's ruling Christian Democrats.   East Berlin also disclosed plans to reorganize itsregional districts into five federal states and to hold stateelections on Oct. 14, about three weeks later than originallyplanned. The division of East Germany into five federalstates would then allow each state to be absorbed into theWest German federal republic as provided for under the BasicLaw, West Germany's constitution.   East Germany stipulated, however, that achieving anall-German ballot depends on the success of the Two-Plus-Fournegotiations on the status of a united Germany. The talksinclude the two Germanys and the four World War II allies --the U.S., the Soviet Union, Britain and France. West GermanChancellor Kohl, who has sanctioned West German credits andaid programs for the ailing Soviet economy, recentlyexpressed confidence that the talks would reach an accord intime for the special session in November of the Conferencefor Security and Cooperation in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
