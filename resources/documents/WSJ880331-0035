Savin, which distributes copiers in the U.S. and Canada, is seeking to eliminate about $140 million of debt and reduce interest expense.    Colorocs Corp., a Norcross, Ga., research and development company, has agreed to buy a major stake in Savin from Toronto-based Polysar Energy andamp; Chemical Corp., formerly Canada Development Corp. and a major Savin creditor. Colorocs is developing a full-color copier to be produced in Japan and distributed by Savin.    The previous restructuring plan called for debt securities to be swapped for Savin common stock; the new plan will swap debt for three new series of convertible preferred shares.    Holders of more than 90% of the debt have indicated they plan to swap their holdings under the revised offer. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Savin's shares closed at 41 cents, up six cents. Shareholders will vote on the plan at the annual meeting set for May 18. </TEXT></DOC>
