It was the fourth consecutive day of falling oil prices and the third major daily decline since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached what industry analysts and others have termed a weak production and pricing agreement last weekend.    The news was greeted enthusiastically by the bond markets, where expectation of lower oil prices has reduced worries about inflation and fueled a powerful rally this week. Stock prices also rose, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 32.99 points to close at 1974.47. Airline and other transportation stocks, which benefit from lower oil prices, were among the strong gainers; the Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 33.71 to 764.71.    But the oil-price news was bleak for Phillips Petroleum Co., which said it plans to lay off as much as 10% of its work force and take other steps to save as much as $200 million over the next two years. Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips is the first oil company to announce retrenching moves since the OPEC accord.    Oil prices were firmer for a while in early trading yesterday, on the basis of some production and supply figures from the American Petroleum Institute that were released after the close of trading Tuesday. But later, general skepticism that major oil-exporting nations will seriously attack their overproduction problem dominated sentiment and depressed prices.    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said OPEC members will have to meet again &quot;well before&quot; their scheduled June session to try to &quot;do something to clean up this mess.&quot;    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil contracts for January delivery gained more than 30 cents in early trading, rising to $16.95 a barrel. But the rally presented an opportunity to sell at unexpectedly attractive prices, and a deluge of sell orders came in from oil producers, traders and speculators all over the world, analysts said. January crude settled at $15.96 a barrel, down 67 cents on the day and bringing the four-day decline to $2.55.    The OPEC agreement seeks to preserve its official -- but widely flouted -- benchmark price of $18 a barrel. Member nations' current official production quotas totaling 16.6 million barrels a day would be unchanged for the next six months except that Iraq, which bowed out of the agreement, won't have a quota. That leaves quotas totaling 15.1 million barrels a day for the other 12 members -- well below the current actual output, which is about 18.5 million barrels daily counting Iraqi production.    In response to the plunge in crude oil prices, several major U.S. refiners lowered their buying price $1 a barrel to $16.50.    Yesterday's closing futures price was the lowest since last Dec. 18. Analysts said the current slide is reminiscent of the first half of 1986, which saw several prolonged oil-price declines, particularly a four-day drop of $5.15 a barrel in late January and early February.    In the spot, or non-contract, market, West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell 70 cents a barrel to $15.95. The spot price of North Sea Brent, a widely traded European crude, ended about 50 cents lower at $15.50.    Heating oil futures for January delivery, meanwhile, fell 1.73 cents a gallon to 49.27 cents. January gasoline settled at 41.70, down 1.37 cents.    The API report that spurred some demand in early trading yesterday disclosed a smaller-than-expected rise of 696,000 barrels in U.S. distillate stocks and a cut of about 1.8% in refinery runs, analysts said. That, plus technical considerations after the previous days' sharp price drops, caused some strength in the European market that was then reflected in New York, they said.    Later, January crude-oil futures fell through $16.55 a barrel, regarded as a key support level. This touched off the avalanche of sales orders that caused the price to drop about 25 cents in a few minutes, one analyst said.    Trading yesterday totaled an estimated 152,971 contracts, topping the previous record of 149,732 set the day before.    Moreover, the price plunge might not be near its end yet, said Robert Boslego, president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass.-based oil consulting firm.    &quot;Crude-oil stocks of 360 million barrels are going to allow refiners to take the classical stance of backing away from a market that's under pressure from both overproduction and excess supplies so as not to disturb the price decline,&quot; he said.    The high level of supplies indicates that January demand will be &quot;extremely low,&quot; he said, amid what is likely to be continued high production.    &quot;The bottom of this market is going to be determined,&quot; he said, &quot;when oil companies and investors feel it is a good time to buy oil at a price low enough that they can make a profit, even if they have to hold it for some time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
