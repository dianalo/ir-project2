The /sup 26/Alcontents are typically 30% or more lower than values obtained by countingtechniques; the /sup 10/Be contents are 10-15% lower. The productionrates (P) of these nuclides decrease by more than a factor of two asthe /sup 4/He//sup 21/Ne ratio increases with increasing shielding from200 to 400. For the lighter shielding conditions expected in stony meteoriteswe estimate P/sub 26/(Fe) as 3-4 dpm/kg and P/sub 10/(Fe) as 4-5 dpm/kg.The average P/sub 10//P/sub 26/ activity ratio is close to 1.5. Exposureages calculated from /sup 21/Ne//sup 26/Al ratios cannot be calibratedso as to agree with both /sup 40/K/K ages and ages based on the shorter-livednuclides /sup 39/Ar and /sup 36/Cl. If agreement with the latter is forced,then the disagreement with /sup 40/K/K ages may signal a 35% increasein the cosmic-ray intensity during the last 10/sup 7/ a.</TEXT></DOC>
