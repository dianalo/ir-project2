Cessation of flow has beendemonstrated by selective arteriography and intravenous digital subtractionangiography, which are though reliable but possess some drawbacks. Thepatient with clinical diagnosis of brain death was evaluated with radionuclidecerebral scintigraphy using sodium pertechnetate /sup 99m/Tc and N-isopropyl-p-(I-/sup123/)iodoamphetamine (IMP). In sodium pertechnetate /sup 99m/Tc scans,no direct cerebral arterial filling was identified. However, static scanstaken at 15 minutes showed radionuclide activity in the sagital sinus.While in the IMP, there was no visualization of either the intracranialarteries or the dural sinuses in radionuclide angiogram, and static scanstaken at 30 minutes after the injection showed absence of radionuclidetracers in the dural sinuses. Furthermore in SPECT with IMP, no intracranialradioactivity was recorded in the whole brain, from the parietal regionof the cerebrum to the brain stem. Because of an advantage of demonstratingblood flow of the whole brain, especially of the brain stem by usingSPECT, it was concluded that cerebral perfusion scintigraphy with IMPwas a very useful method for the diagnosis of brain death.</TEXT></DOC>
