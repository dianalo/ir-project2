ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, with a grinning John Glennstanding by, indicated today he does not think talk that Glenn is``dull and boring'' and ran a disastrous presidential campaign fouryears ago should disqualify the Ohio senator from the vicepresidency.   ``Dull and boring? I kind of like that,'' said the Democraticpresidential nominee-to-be, who himself has been accused of failingto excite audiences.   As for the criticism of Glenn's failed 1984 effort to become theDemocratic presidential nominee, Dukakis said, ``I've won campaignsand I've lost campaigns. I've run good campaigns and have had onedisastrous campaign, so I'm very sympathetic.''   Glenn appeared with Dukakis at a United Auto Workers union hall,the final stop on a Midwest campaign swing by the governor.   While Dukakis emphasized economic and family issues in hisspeeches, much of the attention was diverted to his continuingsearch for a running mate.   During a stop Thursday night in Terre Haute, Ind., Dukakis wasjoined on stage by Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, one of severalmembers of Congress mentioned as potential vice-presidentialchoices.   Monday night, back home in Boston, Dukakis and his wife willhave dinner with Jesse Jackson and Jackson's wife _ a meal certainto include discussion of the Democratic vice presidentialnomination, which Jackson has said he deserves to be offered. ``Ithink part of that will be discussed at some point,'' said Dukakisaide Nick Mitropoulos.   At the UAW hall today, there was no question who was the crowdfavorite for a spot on the Democratic ticket.   ``I've been taking a poll all over America about running mates.What do you think about John Glenn?'' Dukakis asked the unionaudience.   The response was loud applause and whistles. Dukakis turned andshook Glenn's hand, then turning back to the microphone, said,``Sounds unanimous to me.''   Later, when he opened the event to questions from the audience,14-year-old Tammy Watts asked him who his vice-presidential choicewould be.   ``Who do you like?'' asked the candidate.   ``John Glenn,'' she replied.   ``I'm grateful for your advice and counsel,'' he said.   Glenn, who became a national hero when as a Marine pilot andastronaut he became the first American to orbit Earth, has servedon the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and now on the ArmedServices panel.   Hamilton was chairman of the House panel that investigated theIran-Contra affair. He joined the House Foreign Affairs Committeeas a freshman congressman in 1965, now is second in line behindChairman Dante Fascell and is seen as likely to come into thechairmanship eventually. After the 1984 election, he was picked tochair the House Intelligence Committee.   Much of the speculation about the sort of running mate Dukakisshould choose has centered on the need for someone with experiencedealing with foreign policy and defense issues.   Jackson has repeatedly cited his own qualifications for the vicepresidential nomination, beginning with his finish second toDukakis in the race for the top spot on the ticket.   But while saying his strong showing in the primaries andcaucuses earned him the right to consideration for a place on theticket, Jackson has not said whether he actually would accept it ifoffered.   Recently the former civil rights activist said he had made hisdecision, but he refused to disclose it, even to Dukakis.   Their upcoming dinner might offer him the opportunity to do that.   Mitropoulos said it was during a flight Wednesday fromWashington to Des Moines, Iowa, that Dukakis said he'd like toinvite Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, to have a holiday dinnerwith him and his wife, Kitty, at their Brookline, Mass., home.   Nobody could say who would do the cooking or what the menu mightbe.   There also was a possibility they would go to the Hatch Shell onthe shore of the Charles River for the annual holiday concert bythe Boston Pops orchestra.   Mrs. Dukakis' father, Harry Ellis Dickson, is a former associateconductor of the Pops.   Throughout all the speculation about the vice presidency,Dukakis remained adamant about making his decision on his timetable.   ``I have the luxury of having the time and being able to do thisthoughtfully and deliberately,'' he told reporters at an aluminumcompany plant outside Chicago.   ``I'm not going to hurry it,'' he said. ``I'll make a decisionwhen I'm ready to make a decision.''</TEXT></DOC>
