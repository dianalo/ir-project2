Banks are likely to react to the Fed's latest move by matching Chase Manhattan Bank's prime-rate cut earlier this month to 10 1/2% from 11%. That will automatically lead to declines in many consumer lending rates tied to the prime, such as home-equity loans, and it will also mean lower rates for many small and medium-sized businesses.    But the Fed's latest credit-easing step did little to stir much enthusiasm in the bond markets. Treasury bond prices hardly budged all day, finishing close to Tuesday's late levels. One reason is that the Fed move had been widely expected. Also, the dollar fell in the currency markets, commodity prices rose, and investors are bracing for a huge volume of new Treasury borrowing expected in August.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills rose slightly. But the yield on the Treasury's new two-year notes, sold yesterday, averaged 7.75%, the lowest in over a year.    Corporate bond prices were flat, both on investment-grade issues as well on junk bonds. Junk-bond traders said there was little reaction to news that House and Senate negotiators approved steps to crack down on risky investments by thrift institutions. That included a ban on investing in junk issues, the high-yielding bonds of companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all.    The Fed sent strong signals of a credit-easing move when it took no action, for the second day in a row, to prevent a decline in the interest rate on federal funds. This rate on overnight loans between banks is watched because the Fed often uses it as a signal for credit-policy changes. The rate averaged just over 9%, down from its range earlier this month of about 9 1/4%.    Paul DeNoon, an analyst at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., said the first signal of a credit-easing move came Tuesday, and yesterday provided &quot;the confirmation.&quot; If the Fed wasn't easing, &quot;I don't think they would have tolerated&quot; the lower funds rate for two days in a row.    Some bond traders initially reacted warily. They said it's too soon to be sure if the Fed has eased credit because yesterday was the final day of a two-week period in which banks must settle their reserve positions with the central bank. On such days, the funds rate often moves purely for technical reasons.    Nonetheless, the Fed's recent actions have convinced many investment managers that the central bank has moved to ease credit. Fed officials have indicated they want to see lower short-term interest rates to help bolster the economy.    Government reports today and over the next week are likely to reinforce the case for easier credit and pave the way for further moves.    Today, the Commerce Department will estimate the economy's second-quarter performance. According to the average estimate of 17 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the economy grew at a 2% annual rate, after adjusting for inflation. On Aug. 4, the Labor Department will report July employment.    Treasury Securities    Individual investors bought large amounts of new two-year Treasury notes at yesterday's auction.    The average annual yield on the notes was 7.75%. That was down from 8.26% at the previous two-year note auction June 27, 1989, and was the lowest since 7.64% on April 27, 1988.    The Treasury received $1.49 billion in non-competitive tenders, which come mainly from individual investors. That was up sharply from $987 million at the June auction.    In the bond markets, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2019 rose 3/32 to 108 18/32, to yield 8.10%. The 10-year notes were unchanged at 107 13/32, to yield 8%.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at a discount rate of 8.02% bid, up slightly from 8% Tuesday. The latest six-month bills were quoted at a discount rate of 7.62% bid, up from 7.59%.    Here are details of the Treasury's two-year note auction yesterday:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. @ 2-Year Notes @ Applications $28,675,425,000 @ Accepted bids $9,006,620,000 @ Accepted at low price 49% @ Accepted noncompetitively $1,491,000,000 @ Average price (Rate) 100.000 (7.75%) @ High price (Rate) 100.136 (7.73%) @ Low price (Rate) 100.000 (7.75%) @ Interest rate 7 3/4%    The notes are dated July 31 and mature July 31, 1991.    Corporate Issues    Junk bond prices were flat as traders shrugged off news that the nation's thrifts would be required to divest their junk bond holdings within five years.    &quot;The market reacts only to surprises and this was no surprise,&quot; said Alan Schlesinger, head of junk bond trading at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;Legislation curbing thrifts from investing in the junk market has been anticipated for some time, so there has been no reaction from the market,&quot; he said.    Still, some traders said that while the legislation had been anticipated, many investors and dealers had been expecting a bill that would allow limited investments in junk bonds.    House and Senate conferees decided yesterday to bar thrifts from directly investing in junk bonds and requiring them to divest their holdings no later than Aug. 1, 1994. The proposal allows junk bond investment in separately capitalized affiliates of thrift institutions.    Traders and analysts say the five-year time frame for thrifts to divest the $15 billion of junk bonds held by them will temper any negative impact.    &quot;Five years is a couple of generations in the junk bond world,&quot; said one junk bond trader. &quot;The market has grown tremendously in the past few years and this isn't going to be a problem.&quot;    Today, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. plans to price a $200 million 10-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Inc. The issue is already oversubscribed, sources said.    In the investment-grade market, corporate issues closed unchanged.    In other corporate bond market news, Wall Street underwriting firms will see increased competition as three more commercial banks were given the green light to underwrite and trade corporate bonds.    The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to units of Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Bankers Trust New York Corp. to underwrite and deal in corporate debt. They will join a J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. unit in the business.    Philip Morris Cos. tapped the new-issue market with a $300 million, five-year note offering priced at a yield spread of 0.95 percentage point above the five-year Treasury note, to yield 8.725%. Municipal Issues    Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading.    The negotiated pricing sector was topped by a $192 million issue from the Jacksonville Transportation Authority, Fla., through underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. The issue was oversubscribed, according to the lead underwriter.    Yields for the senior lien bonds range from 5.80% in 1990 to 7% in 2013. The junior lien bonds were priced to yield from 5.80% in 1990 to 6.50% in 1998.    In the secondary, or resale market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds were quoted at 98 3/4, off 1/4, to yield 7.29%.    Mortgage-Backed Securities    Mortgage securities rose 3/32 point, despite a $500 million sale by New West Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association.    New West, formed with the troubled assets of California-based American Savings andamp; Loan Association, once the nation's largest thrift, sold $500 million of Ginnie Mae 9% securities through competitive bidding.    The sale is believed to the first from New West's mortgage securities portfolio, estimated at $13 billion. Officials at Ranieri Wilson andamp; Co., which is managing the New West mortgage-backed liquidation program, weren't available for comment.    Elsewhere, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for August delivery ended at 98 21/32, up 3/32, while its 9 1/2% issue closed at 100 21/32, up 3/32. Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% securities closed at 99 21/32, also up 3/32.    Meanwhile, homeowners are increasingly opting for fixed-rate mortgages over adjustable-rate loans, which should mean increased supply of fixed-rate mortgage securities in the secondary market.    A Federal National Mortgage Association survey found that applications for fixed-rate loans rose 34% in June after a 17% increase in May, while applications for adjustable-rate loans fell 28% in June after a 22% drop in May.    The shift to fixed-rate loans is expected to continue because they now are widely available for under 10%, while fully indexed ARM rates are higher, except for first-year teaser rates.    Foreign Bonds    British government bonds surged as the pound rallied on news of an unexpectedly small U.K. trade deficit.    Some actively traded British bonds rose about 3/4 point. The 11 3/4% bonds of 2003/2007 rose 23/32 point to 115, to yield 9.72%. The 12% issue due 1995 rose half a point to 106 11/32, to yield 10.44%.    The U.K. current account deficit for June was #1.49 billion, lower than the #1.6 billion pound deficit many economists had expected, although up from May's deficit of #1.32 billion.    Japanese government bond prices ended flat after swinging widely earlier in the day. Japan's benchmark No. 111, 4.6% bonds of 1998 finished unchanged at 96.79 to yield 5.125%. Volume was brisk.    Japan's Finance Ministry set a 4.9% coupon rate for an issue of 600 billion yen of 10-year government bonds. Forty percent of the 10-year issue will be auctioned today in Japan, while the rest will be distributed under fixed syndicate allotments at the average auction price. Traders expect the issue to yield just over 5%.    West German government bonds rose slightly. Bonn's 7% issue due February 1999 climbed 0.11 point to 102.41, while its yield fell to 6.64% from 6.66%. </TEXT></DOC>
