Of these accidents reported by the NTSB, there were 567 fatalities.The following is a summary of the number of icing related accidents andthe number of fatalities by manufacturer: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s50,7,7 </C>  <H1>  </H1><H1>Accidents </H1><H1>Fatalities</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cessna <D>206 </D><D>108 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Piper <D>121 </D><D>147 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beech <D>104 </D><D>201 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mooney <D>14 </D><D>23 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mitsubishi <D>6 </D><D>18 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Grumman Am. <D>10 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gulfstream <D>14 </D><D>24 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other <D>41 </D><D>34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals<D>516 </D><D>567</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG></ITAG>These statistics show that icing related accidents have resulted in anaverage of over 50 people killed each year since 1975.

This type of approval was allowed because it was feltthat such equipment provides an additional level of safety for the airplaneshould inadvertent icing be encountered. The second factor involves the current practice of airplane manufacturersapproving some models for icing flight. This has resulted in airplanesof the same model being delivered, some of which are completely equippedand approved for flight into known icing conditions, while others may beonly partially equipped and not approved for flight in known icing conditions.Many of these models, whose certification bases are prior to the requirementsof Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 3.772, do not have a placard to advise thepilot of the meterological conditions in which the airplane is authorizedor capable of flying. This creates an environment in which a pilot mayfly an airplane that is properly equipped and approved to fly in knownicing conditions, while at some time later he may have occasion to flythe same model that is only partially equipped (e.g., wing and horizontalstabilizer boots only). The pilot may assume that the second airplane isalso approved to fly in known icing conditions since there is no placardinstalled to tell him otherwise, and a hazardous icing encounter couldresult. Neither the earlier type certification rules to which these airplanes werecertified nor the operating rules with which all airplanes have to complyrequire the installation of a placard which informs the pilot that theairplane is approved for flight in icing conditions, or that it is prohibitedfrom such flight. The installation of such a placard was not made a certificationrule until Amendment 3-7 to CAR 3, which added paragraph 3.772 to CAR 3in 1962. This rule required that ``A placard shall be provided in clearview of the pilot which specifies the type of operations (e.g., VFR, IFR,day or night) and the meteorological conditions (e.g., icing conditions)to which the operation of the airplane is limited by the equipment installed.''Airplanes certificated prior to the adoption of Amendment 3-7, but stillbeing manufactured, are not required to have this placard installed. Itis estimated that approximately 50% of the airplanes involved in icingrelated accidents do not contain such a placard. There is obviously noguarantee that the installation of a placard will, in all cases, preventicing accidents from happening. However, the FAA has concluded that thiscorrective action is needed to prohibit certain airplanes from flight inknown icing conditions, except those equipped with approved icing equipmentand approved for icing flight. Since the condition described herein existson these certain airplanes whose certification bases are prior to the 1962adoption of paragraph 3.772, the FAA is proposing an AD which would requireplacards that specifically identify whether these airplanes are, or arenot, approved for flight in known icing conditions and thereby reduce thepossibility of icing related accidents.This AD will effect those airplanes whose adverse service histories appearto make them most susceptible to icing encounter accidents. The FAA iscontinuing to evaluate the service history of the remaining pre-CAR 3.772airplanes. This evaluation may reveal the need for subsequent AD's to improvethe airworthiness of these airplanes.The FAA has determined there are approximately 113,700 airplanes affectedby the proposed AD. The cost of placarding the airplanes as specified inthe proposed AD is estimated to be $50 per airplane. The total cost isestimated to be $5,685,000 to the private sector. Few, if any, small entitiesare expected to own a sufficient number of airplanes for this cost to exceedthe threshold for Regulatory Flexibility Action.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.Therefore, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' underthe provisions of Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule''under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under thecriteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
