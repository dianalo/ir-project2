In the initial 18 months of the agreement, Du Pont will study the protein and provide $1.5 million in research support to Synergen, the company said. If the initial tests warrant further development, the agreement calls for Du Pont and Synergen to spend another $17 million in clinical testing and regulatory applications, with most of the funding coming from Du Pont, Synergen said.    The protein, produced using recombinant DNA techniques, has been shown to induce formation of new blood vessels and stimulate the production of certain enzymes, Synergen said. The studies will determine the protein's potential in treating cardiovascular and neurological disorders. </TEXT></DOC>
