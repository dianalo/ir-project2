However, said Rhodes, &quot;CADKeymade the early stages of development go faster.&quot;andM;In the next phase, Rhodes hopes to keep the entire process on-line: &quot;We'reworking on direct diagnosis from the data.&quot; This makes Rhodes part of anotherCAD trend: keeping data in digital form from beginning to end.andM;At the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings andamp; Merrill, CAD drawing filesbecome input for the fabrication of architectural models.andP;  &quot;We havemodel-making machines in both New York and Chicago,&quot; explained associatepartner Richard Rogers, who is based in the firm's Chicago office.andP;  &quot;New Yorkhas a laser cutter, and Chicago has a numerically controlled machine.&quot;andM;Both machines permit generation of model parts directly from drawing files,with far less labor than traditional techniques.andP;  The result is greaterspeed, lower costs and higher quality of work -- all strategic priorities forthe company.andM;These strategic issues have made CAD a vital tool for Sheldon Childs, apump-design consultant doing business as Impeller Pumps Inc. in Willington,Conn.andP;  Childs was concerned that the difficulty of manual methods for pumpdesign discouraged designers from pursuing the best possible answer.andP;  &quot;Whenit takes two weeks, the designer isn't real eager to do it over,&quot; he said.andM;Childs therefore set out to automate the pump-design process by creating aprogram called Impro.andP;  The program's speed and precision encourage designersto apply their traditional approximations at a far greater level of detail.andO;&quot;It takes anywhere from an hour to a day, vs.andP;  weeks to design a pump byhand,&quot; he said.andM;Entrepreneurial SuccessandM;Childs has found his work greatly aided by the new generation of affordableCAD tools.andP;  He has worked primarily with CADKey.andP;  &quot;We developed a way totranslate the hydraulic-design parameters and layouts into CADKey, then addmechanical details such as bearings and seals,&quot; he explained.andP;  If conditionschange, &quot;you can [accurately] do it over in 20 minutes.&quot;andM;The result has been a dramatic extension of one man's expertise, and anentrepreneurial success.andP;  &quot;We have about three-dozen full issues of Improwith all the major pump companies.andP;  Most of our revenue comes from thesoftware,&quot; rather than direct consulting work.andM;Other firms are bringing the precision and flexibility of CAD to the world ofthe imagination.andP;  Minuteman Software, in Stow, Mass., has extended itsGPSS/PC simulation environment with a utility called Animator; this couplesIBM's General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS) simulations withthree-dimensional animation layouts and active component shapes that arebuilt in AutoCAD.andM;Minuteman's CAD Animator program couples the GPSS simulation trace file withthe AutoCAD drawings to create an animated on-screen mock-up of the systemmodel.andP;  For example, a factory simulation might show the actual flow ofsubassemblies among various points in the plant.andP;  This makes simulationresults more accessible to those who find traditional tabular reportsdifficult to understand.andM;Developers are also extending traditional CAD with utilities for parametricdesign.andP;  In the same way that a spreadsheet does calculations with formulas,updating values based on predefined relationships, parametric tools updatedrawings based on changes in their key dimensions.andM;One such package is Synthesis 3.0, from Synthesis Inc., of Bellingham, Wash.andO;Synthesis allows users to define a &quot;Master Drawing&quot; in AutoCAD.andP;  In thisdrawing, names replace the usual specific values for dimensions.andP;  A moduledefines the relationships among these variables and specifies what questionsSynthesis should ask when that master drawing is used.andM;&quot;We used to need about three months to design and draw a wastewater-treatmentplant,&quot; said Larry Young, systems manager at the Riverside, Calif.,andO;engineering firm of Albert Webb and Associates.andP;  &quot; .  .  .  At least a monthand a half just for the drafting.andP;  Now, with Synthesis, that's down to abouttwo weeks for the whole job.&quot;andM;Every business application of computers begins as an on-line version of along-familiar task.andP;  Word processing, for example, began as &quot;memorytypewriting,&quot; but soon came to be used as a tool for thinking.andP;  Spreadsheetsbegan by producing grids of numbers, then evolved into powerful tools fordecision support.andM;Databases began as easy-to-search file cabinets, then developed into newperspectives on corporate knowledge.andM;Today, you don't have to be a typist to use word processing, or a bookkeeperto use a spreadsheet, or a file clerk to use a database.andP;  And you don't haveto be a draftsman to appreciate the contributions of today's CAD products,which can serve as &quot;graphics editors&quot; that link with every other kind ofcomputer application.andM;&quot;It's like hog farmers talking about using everything but the squeal,&quot; saidPrecision Sampling's Goodman.andP;  &quot;We get everything out of our drawings that wecan.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
