 Lighter and more powerful than coax or twisted pair, fiber sportsmassive amounts of bandwidth and very high reliability.andP;  Copper cable fallsprey to the radio frequency (RF) interference emitted by seemingly harmlessitems like fluorescent lights and photocopiers.andP;  Fiber, however, isinherently immune to electrical noise.andP;  And while copper wiring requiresheavy shielding to operate in industrial areas, fiber does not.andP;  Sincefiber's components are made from dielectric materials, it is impervious tolightning.andM;Another advantage to fiber is security.andP;  Signals on copper cable are emittedoutside the cable jacket, whic makes it easy for intruders to listen inwithout being detected.andP;  To hear a conversation, the perpetrator never has topenetrate the cable, making detection virtually impossible.andP;  Light, on theother hand, does not radiate beyond the fiber cable.andP;  Snoopers mustphysically cut the cable and tap into the signal, causing the light level tofluctuate.andP;  A light meter monitoring the system can detect the intrusion andnotify the administrator, who can then discourage the intruder.andP;  Fiber is notsecure because it is harder to tap.andP;  It is secure because it must be tapped.andM;Further security is added with TEMPEST, the U.S.andP;  government set of standardsfor security, which can apply to most any type of government equipment.andO;10Net Communications, a subsidiary of DCA, makes a TEMPEST version of its10Net for Fiber Optic, which has been approved by the government for use inTEMPEST installations.andP;  Not only is fiber used but software encrypts the dataon the hard drive.andP;  Later versions of 10Net will offer data encryption overthe cabling, further strengthening security.andM;The maximum signal distance on fiber optics is also far greater than that ofcoax or twisted pair wiring.andP;  Copper wiring limits Ethernet to about 2.7kilometers.andP;  With fiber, however, the maximum distance is extended to 4.5kilometers.andP;  Token Ring runs between multistation access units (MAUs) areincreased from 100 meters to four kilometers.andP;  Fiber even helps Arcnet.andP;  Theusual 2,000 feet node-to-hub limitation is extended to 9,000 feet.andM;Another well-publicized advantage is fiber's bandwidth.andP;  Neither Ethernetwhich runs at 10M bits per second nor Token Ring which tops off at 16, bitsper second take full advantage of fiber's bandwidth, since fiber's capacityruns into the range of hundreds of millions of bits per second.andP;  At present,the need for that kind of bandwidth is limited.andP;  However, increased graphics,multimedia documents and new high speed processors will demand a newer andmore powerful transport.andM;Already within the engineering community, LANs are hard pressed to handle thefiles created by CAD/CAM and other graphics-intensive applications.andP;  Asuperior conduit will be needed.andP;  Fiber is that conduit.andM;Where Fiber FitsandM;Despite fiber's many advantages, it has yet to dominate the cabling arena.andO;&quot;We have yet to hit the year of fiber optics,&quot; says John Corman, president ofCorman Technologies.andP;  &quot;Fiber optics will grow greatly in the future,unencumbered by the two factors now limiting its acceptance: the cost ofhardware and the difficulty of installation.andP;  Difficulty of installation doesnot refer to the cable itself, but rather it concerns the terminators.andP;  Farmore is involved with making a reliable fiber connection than with coax ortwisted pair.andP;  As the technology ages, the relative difficulty of connectingfiber will be reduced,&quot; Corman continues.andM;Fiber has been heartily adopted in government and financial institutions.andO;Both communities have selected fiber because of its security advantages.andP;  Inaddition to being immune to electromagnetic interference, &quot;Fiber is alsoimpervious to EMP or electromagnetic pulse,&quot; says Corman.andP;  &quot;EMP is emittedduring the detonation of a nuclear warhead.andP;  EMP disrupts all electricaldevices, causing a nuclear blackout.andP;  Fiber is not affected by EMP.andP;  Thus, ifthe computers are properly insulated, the network can still function during anuclear bomb attack.andP;  That is, until the actual explosion and then not evenfiber will be of much use.&quot;andM;Manufacturing and linking remote LANs are two other areas where fiber isparticularly applicable.andP;  Factories don't need fiber for its speed, but forits noise immunity.andP;  For a similar reason, fiber has found a place inhospitals where devices emitting electromagnetic noise, such as X-ray andultrasound machines, are common.andM;As a backbone, fiber is ideal.andP;  While fiber to the desktop is rarelyimplemented, a fiber backbone which links individual LANs is fairly common.andO;Its bandwidth, flexibility and maximum distances make fiber a superior choiceover coaxial cable when running between buildings, under highways and acrosstown.andP;  Many installations today implement a fiber backbone through abuilding's risers and then run twisted pair from wiring closets on each floorto individual desktops.andM;As fiber becomes more and more common, the cost of the components will drop,thereby stimulating the installation of more fiber LANs.andP;  But today, saysFrank Fuller, Chipcom's fiber optic product manager, &quot;Prices are too high.andO;Today, a fiber transceiver costs $500, and a hub can cost between $400 and$600.andP;  That's $1,000 per connection, which is far more expensive than twistedpair.andP;  Greater demand for fiber to the desk and increased competition willbring down prices.&quot;andP;  By next year, expect fiber optic transceivers to beincorporated onto Token Ring and Ethernet network interface cards.andM;While mass conversion to fiber for LANs which are already installed has yetto occur, many new installations are pulling fiber along with twisted pair.andO;Hal Spurney, director of marketing for Fibronics, notes, &quot;80% to 85% of newinstallations put in fiber at some time.&quot;andP;  Warren Umstead, market developmentmanager for DuPont's Optical Electronics Division puts the percentage at 60%.andO;&quot;The major cost of wiring a building is not the wiring itself, but the timeand labor spent pulling the cable.andP;  If you are wiring a new building, planfor the future.andP;  Even if you are not using fiber right now, install it,&quot;advises Umstead.andM;Cabling TypesandM;As twisted pair and coax are different types of copper cable, there aredifferent types of fiber optic cable.andP;  But whether the data is transmitted inelectrical or optical signals, the fundamentals are the same.andP;  Signals areManhester-encoded with bits represented as either on or off.andP;  Transceivers,whether separate or integrated onto an interface card, convert theelectromagnetic signals from the device to the optical equivalent.andP;  Apowerful Light Emitting Diode (LED) emits infrared light (830 nanometers) tosend signals down the cabling.andM;The fiber itself can be divided into two categories: single-mode andmultimode.andP;  Single-mode fiber has an aperture of about nine microns.andP;  Lightentering into this very narrow opening is channeled along a single centerpath or mode.andP;  In contrast, multimode cabling has an aperture of 50, 62.5, 85or 100 microns.andP;  Because the aperture is larger, light enters at variousangles, thereby creating multiple modes or paths through the cable.andP;  As thesignals move toward the cable's walls, they are refracted back to the center,increasing the cable's attenuation.andP;  Because of multimode cable's higherattenuation, its signal is weaker and does not travel as far.andP;  Although thedistances are shorter with multimode, the tranceiver and connector costs areconsiderably lower.andP;  In general, single-mode fiber is almost exclusively forvery long distance networks, like those of the telephone companies.andO;Multimode cable is used for data.andM;Fiber cable is either duplex, simplex or hybrid.andP;  These terms refer to thenumber of the fibers held in the cable.andP;  Duplex cabling has two fibers, onefor transmitting, the other for receiving.andP;  Simplex is a single fiber whichcarries a single transmission.andP;  A second cable is used for the receivingpath.andP;  Hybrid cabling is a combination of media into a single sheath.andP;  IBMhas a twisted pair/fiber optic hybrid cable.andP;  A number of manufacturers sella hybrid cable of single mode and multimode fiber.andM;Some cable manufacturers, including Corning Glass Works, 3M and OFTI,specialize in manufacturing and selling fiber optic cabling.andP;  Others willsell cabling along with other products such as interface boards, hubs andtransceivers.andM;Plastic FiberandM;Almost all the fiber installed today is made from glass.andP;  Although glassfiber permits greater distances and a larger capacity, it is more difficultto install than plastic fiber.andP;  Glass fiber needs polishing to attain a flatsurface and a low gloss.andP;  According to Richard Lefkowitz, vice president ofengineering at plastic and glass fiber LAN maker Codenoll, &quot;The process couldtake several minutes in the field, and that's only after a certain level ofexpertise.&quot;andM;Plastic fiber is significantly easier to handle.andP;  Just cut the tip with arazor blade and attach the connector.andP;  There is no time-consuming polishing.andO;Because the connectors are fairly easy to apply, pre-connectorized cable isnot needed.andM;Another advantage of plastic fiber is the light used.andP;  FDDI will use light ata frequency of 1300 nanometers, far above the human visual range.andP;  Most fiberLANs use light at 830 nanometers.andP;  Plastic optics will use light at 660nanometers, which is within a person's visual range.andP;  This makes detectingbreaks in the cable easier.andM;A drawback of plastic fiber is its greater attenuation.andP;  As a signal travelsdown a length of a cable, friction gradually weakens the signal.andP;  This iscalled attenuation.andP;  Glass fiber has an attenuation of 0.004 dB per meter or4 dB per kilometer.andP;  Plastic fiber has a significantly higher attenuation at0.15 per meter or roughly 150 dB per kilometer.andP;  A three dB loss isequivalent to cutting the power in half.andP;  For every 20 meters of plasticfiber, the signal's power is cut in half.andM;Currently, there are two companies heavily involved with plastic fiberoptics.andP;  Codenoll is exploring a standards-based fiber optic LAN.andP;  It isplaying an active part in getting companies in the IEEE 802 committee togenerate additional plastic optic standards.andM;Netronix's is shipping Fiberstar.andP;  This plastic fiber LAN can be run up to100 meters between nodes transmitting at 2M bits per second.andP;  According toArthur Jopling, Netronix's president, &quot;Fiberstar extends conventional plasticdistance from 1m meters to 100 meters.andP;  Speed, on the other hand, is limitedby the LEDs.andP;  For plastic, 660 nanometers is the ideal transmitting strength.andO;However, at that wavelength most LEDs have a fairly limited bandwidth.&quot;andP;  Atthe Fiberstar hub, glass and plastic fiber may be joined.andP;  Broadband LANs canjoin the plastic LAN using bridges.andP;  Fiberstar PC adapter cards sell to $595,or $805 with TCP/IP software.andP;  Sixteen-port hubs cost $2,195.andM;Ethernet Stars and BusesandM;There are two ways Ethernet is implemented over fiber optic cable: a backboneor a star.andP;  Copper Ethernet LANs are connected to the fiber backbone viabridges.andP;  The actual copper-to-fiber connection is made with a fiber optictransceiver, which attaches to the Ethernet user device via a standard AUItransceiver cable.andP;  The fiber optic transceiver broadcasts signals onto thebackbone.andP;  It also detects collisions on the backbone.andM;Today, there is no standard way of encoding Ethernet transmission on fiberoptic cable.andP;  There is, however, an 802.3 10BASE-F standard called FiberOptic Inter-Repeater Link (FOIRL), which defines point-to-point fiber opticcommunications.andP;  The FOIRL standard defines how the create fiber opticbackbones using transceivers.andP;  Transceivers which conform to this standardare all supposed to interoperate.andM;Like all Ethernet LANs, FOIRL's distance is limited by the network'sround-trip propagation delay, which is twice the time a signal takes totravel between a LAN's two furthermost points.andP;  The propagation delay is alsothe time a computer waits before assuming a collision has occurred.andP;  The IEEEhas standardized on 46.7 microseconds as the upper limit for the round-trippropagation delay.andM;With light traveling one kilometer every five microseconds, the absolutemaximum of an all-fiber link is 4.5 kilometers.andP;  However, most networksconnected via FOIRLs are copper-based.andP;  Copper wiring requires twomicroseconds for start up before the packet can be sent, due to copper'sinherent properties.andP;  This limits the distance of a copper and fiber network,since it reduces the amount of time available to moving signals.andP;  By the IEEEstandard, the maximum distance for an FOIRL is one kilometer.andM;Ethernet can also be physically implemented as a star.andP;  At the star's centeris the concentrator.andP;  From the star radiate fiber optic links, each of whichis equivalent to the bus of a copper Ethernet.andP;  At the end of each link istransceiver and a user device.andP;  The transceivers convert the light pulse intoelectrical form and vice versa.andM;There are two types of transceivers, single-port and multi-port.andP;  Asingle-port attaches one device to a fiber segment, and a multi-port attachesmultiple devices to the same transceiver.andP;  Using multi-port transceiverssaves making a number of taps into the cable.andP;  While most coaxialtransceivers are integrated onto the interface card, most fiber transceiversare external boxes.andP;  When more fiber is run to the desktop, integratedtransceivers will become more common.andM;The concentrator or hub of the fiber optic star incorporates severaltransceivers.andP;  Many concentrators support fiber, coax and twisted pair wiringon different transceiver cards of the same wiring enclosure.andP;  Some alsopermit MAC-layer bridges to be integrated into the concentrator.andP;  Hubs may beactive, passive or hybrid.andM;At the active hub, transceivers convert incoming optical signals into theirelectrical equivalent, regenerate them, and then convert them back to opticalsignals.andP;  They also divert a fraction of the light for detecting collisions.andO;Active hubs have an additional processor to detect collisions.andP;  On a copperEthernet, a collision is a large increase in signal level.andP;  On active fibernetworks, however, a collision is defined as any two incoming signals.andM;There are two types of active concentrators, synchronous and asynchronous.andO;Synchronous active hubs emit a constant thing signal to keep networkedcomputers constantly &quot;in sync.&quot;andP;  Asynchronous active concentrators do notemit a timing signal.andP;  Instead, every packet contains preamble bits forsetting the receiving device's clock.andP;  When a packet is received, the devicesets its clock by the transitions between the preamble bits.andP;  It must set itsclock every time a packet is received.andM;A repeater is required to connect two asynchronous concentrators.andO;Synchronous concentrators, on the other hand, do not require a repeater.andP;  Amaximum of two repeaters in a row can be used in an asynchronous network.andP;  Asynchronous LAN may span further distances than an asynchronous one.andM;Passive concentrators, a second type of fiber optic hub, move light from oneinternal transceiver to another without converting them into electricalsignals.andP;  All collision detection and management functions are carried out atthe workstation's transceiver.andP;  Collisions are detected using a specialencoding technique called CRV.andP;  If a collision occurs then the CRV number ischanged.andP;  Unlike an active hub, a passive hub does not require an externalpower source.andM;The hybrid hub is a passive concentrator supporting collision detection atthe star's center.andP;  As the signal enters the concentrator, one-tenth of thelight is diverted to an active collision detection device.andP;  The device looksfor simultaneous signals from two optical transceivers.andP;  If the signals aredetected, then a collision has occurred.andP;  A separate fiber connected to thestar carries a jam signal notifying the workstations of the collision.andP;  If apower failure occurs, then the system reverts to a passive star with thetransceivers detecting collisions.andP;  While many vendors make active andpassive hubs, only Siecor makes a hybrid hub.andM;Active concentrators are more susceptible to failure than passive devices.andO;Power failure, spikes or other electrical problems can crash the concentratorand a segment of the LAN.andP;  Additionally, retiming and boosting the signal'samplitude introduces an additional propagation delay.andP;  Passive concentrators,on the other hand, are immune to power disturbance and hence are morereliable.andP;  They also tend to be far cheaper than their active counterparts.andM;Passive hubs permit a shorter LAN than active hubs.andP;  While passiveconcentrators limit the LAN to 800 meters, active concentrators extend theLAN's maximum distance to four kilometers.andP;  Passive concentrators suffer froman additional problem.andP;  &quot;In a passive star, transceivers may not detectcollisions simultaneously because of the different cable lengths.andP;  Ratherthey may be detected only after the next packet is sent.andP;  Thus passiveconcentrators should be limited to comparatively small workgroups,&quot; says KenAllen, director of customer service at Siecor Electro-Optic Products.andM;Ethernet ChoicesandM;Except for the FOIRL, there is no fiber optic Ethernet standard.andP;  But needpreceeds standards.andP;  So there are a number of vendors supplying fiber opticEthernet solutions.andM;FiberCom makes an 802.3 fiber optic LAN.andP;  WhisperLAN is implemented using adual, counter-rotating ring architecture, which is the same topology as FDDI.andO;(Note that WhisperLAN is not FDDI.)andP;  Fibercom's PC Ethernet cards have thedistinction of being one of the few with integrated transceivers.andP;  The cardwith an integrated transceiver costs $1,750.andP;  FiberCom's external transceiverbegins at $1,100.andP;  A multiport transceiver costs between $2,200 and $2,700.andO;For those who demand fiber plus fault tolerance, FiberCom's DPT will bewelcome.andP;  The $2,000 Dual Path Transceiver (DPT) is a fully redundanttransceiver for the dual ring LAN.andP;  FiberCom also offers fiber-to-coaxrepeaters for $1,500.andM;Fault tolerance is high on Chipcom's list of priorities, too.andP;  ORnet is acompletely fault-tolerant active star 802.3 LAN.andP;  Redundancy comes on twolevels.andP;  ORnet stars can be connected with redundant fiber cable, so if thecable or the hub fails, the other link can automatically take over.andP;  ORnetLANs also support a second backbone.andP;  If the cable is severed, then trafficis automatically rerouted onto the backup cable.andP;  ORnet comes in 14- andeight-port hubs, costing $5,950 and $4,150, respectively.andP;  Both Chipcom's andRAD Data Communications' fiber Ethernet LANs use synchronous signalling.andM;Siecor manufactures passive, active and hybrid stars.andP;  The active starsupports up to 32 nodes spanning a maximum two kilometers from theconcentrator.andP;  Five concentrators may be connected via four repeaters toincrease node count and distance.andP;  The nodes can be set 250 meters from theconcentrator.andP;  The passive stars come in four-, eight-, 16- and 32-nodeconfigurations.andP;  The last configuration is the hybrid star.andP;  Its dimensionsand maximum node count mirror the passive star.andP;  Siecor recommends its threetopologies for differing systems.andP;  The active star is favored by larger andexpanding LANs.andP;  The passive star and the hybrid stars are used by smaller,more confined networks.andM;Codenoll manufactures both passive and active stars.andP;  The passive stars comein both medium and long distance versions.andP;  The medium stars are limited to500 meters.andP;  They can support either seven or 19 devices.andP;  The 19-port hubcosts $2,195.andP;  The long distance versions have four, eight, 16 or 32 ports.andO;They extend up to 800 meters and cost up to $8,495.andP;  For additional distancethe active star can be used.andP;  The active star is a modular unit supporting upto 15 connections.andP;  Codenoll also sells tranceivers from $495 to $795.andM;Fiber optics is a big part of Synoptics' LattisNet, which is best known forits ability to run Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair.andP;  The 802.3 LAN usesan active star.andP;  Each hub supports 66 devices, and hubs can be linked for amaximum of 1,024 devices.andP;  The LattisNet concentrator supports fiber, IBMcabling and twisted pair.andP;  The network comes integrated with a networkmanagement system.andP;  The cost per node is $500.andP;  The network managementsoftware retails for $50 per port.andP;  MAC-layer bridges can be integrated intothe concentrator.andM;Raycom manufactures 802.3 fiber optic MAC-layer bridges.andP;  The Bridge+Fiberfamily connects Ethernet LANs running over fiber, Ethernet, thin Ethernet andStarlan wiring.andP;  A Bridge+Fiber plus a repeater can link LANs up to 800meters apart.andP;  If two bridges are used, a four kilometer link is established.andO;The bridges filter 8,000 frames per second and transfer 5,000 frames persecond.andP;  The price for Raycom's Bridge+Fiber is $7,695.andM;Token RingandM;On Token Ring LANs, fiber optic cable is most often used as a backbone andalmost never to the desktop.andP;  As in copper-based Token Ring networks,computers attach directly to an eight-port MAU using twisted-pair cable.andP;  TheMAU creates a ring of PCs internally and it is around this ring that theelectronic token is passed giving network access to attached computers.andP;  Sofar, however, there is no room for fiber optic cable in this scheme.andM;Standard 803.5-compliant MAUs have two extra ports called Ring In and RingOut.andP;  These are for connecting the MAUs together.andP;  To connect via fiber mostMAUs require an external repeater.andP;  The repeater attaches to the Ring In andthe Ring Out ports via twisted pair.andP;  The repeater and transceiver take theincoming optical signal and convert it to an electromagnetic signal.andP;  A fewcompanies, such as RAD Data Communications have incorporated the repeaterinto the MAU.andM;Two points to know about selecting fiber optic MAUs.andP;  Most manufacturers seekto comply with IBM's original MAU specification.andP;  Thus, they are essentiallythe same.andP;  The second point is IBM has copyrighted the name &quot;MAU.&quot;andP;  Companieshave been forced to find different names for the same product.andP;  Don't befooled.andP;  Whether it's a wire center, a concentrator, a TAU or an MSAU theyare all modified MAUs.andM;RAD has an MAU that sports automatic switch-over.andP;  Normally a failed nodemust be manually disconnected from the ring.andP;  Until then the network staysdown.andP;  RAD's MAU will automatically disconnect when the node fails.andP;  RAD hasalso integrated repeaters into the MAU to conserve space in the wiringcloset.andP;  The MAU comes in eight-port configurations costing $595.andP;  RAD offersseparate repeaters for installation in the RO (Ring Out) port of the MAU.andO;They cost $1,100.andM;In addition to Ethernet, Siecor manufactures fiber Token Ring.andP;  With Siecor'sUniversal Concentrator, the two can be combined in a central cabinet.andP;  TheUniversal Concentrator is a modular hub which houses the differenttransceivers.andP;  The Concentrator holds up to 17 dual-port transceivers for atotal of 34 connections.andP;  The system supports both 4M- and16M-bits-per-second Token Ring implementations.andP;  A backup power supply can beinstalled in case of electrical failure.andP;  If the power fails then an audibleand visual alarm are activated notifying the LAN administrator.andP;  Foradditional connections, Concentrators may be daisy chained using one port oneach.andP;  The total number of available connections for every two concentratorswould be 66, with two devoted to linking the units.andM;Siecor's Token Ring transceivers attach to user devices via twisted pair.andO;The transceivers then connect to the concentrator via optical fiber.andP;  Theyhave LEDs displaying the status of the cable connected to the concentrator.andO;The universal concentrator, rack mounted, costs $1,545.andP;  The power supply is$825.andP;  The transceivers cost $750 and $1,000, depending on type.andP;  The dualport modules run for $750.andM;Of the token passing LAN makers, Proteon offers one of broadest lines offiber optic LANs.andP;  ProNET LANs run at 4M-, 10M- and 80M bits-per-second.andO;ProNET-4 is an 802.5-complaint LAN running over a physical star supporting amaximum of 260 nodes.andP;  The system supports XTs, ATs and PS/2s.andP;  On AT bus andMicro Channel cards, bus mastering is implemented to increase performance.andM;Proteon's wire centers are intelligent.andP;  The network manager can remotelycontrol wire centers from a central location, which is particularly helpfulwhen working in a campus environment where wire centers may be distributedthroughout several floors and buildings.andP;  A LAN administrator can disable andenable wire centers from her PC.andP;  If a wire center should fail then thenetwork loops back on itself.andP;  Unlike other MAUs, Proteon has linked its wirecenters via an external phone line, which aids troubleshooting if there arecabling problems.andP;  ProNET-4 wire centers sell for $895 to $995 and theinterface cards sell for $695 to $750.andP;  Fiber optic modems are required forsome cards.andP;  They are $1,850 to $3,200.andM;ArcnetandM;No one buys fiber for Arcnet LANs for the speed.andP;  People buy it for thesecurity and immunity.andP;  All in all, interest in fiber optic Arcnet is mostlytalk.andP;  &quot;Many people ask about Arcnet fiber but very few actually buy.andP;  SMCsells, at most, 20 a month.andP;  Those LANs that are purchased are installed invery specialized locations such as nuclear reactors, chemical plants and, ofcourse, governmental installations,&quot; says Geof Karlin, marketing manager atStandard Microsystems.andM;Arcnet LANs are configured in a star with an active hub sitting in thecenter.andP;  Attached to the Arcnet hub is a series of point-to-point links, eachterminating at a computer or some other device.andP;  Despite the low interest,products abound, and virtually all have integrated fiber optic transceivers.andO;That's because Raycom sold a transceiver module.andP;  Cards using thistransceiver require the more expensive simplex cabling and the LAN has amaximum distance of 9,000 feet.andM;Because Raycom's fiber transceiver and the simplex cable are costly, someArcnet manufacturers developed other solutions.andP;  By developing its owntransceiver, Pure Data cut the cost of the Arcnet card by 50% and increasedthe transmission distance by 25% to 12,500 feet.andP;  Raycom's transceiver isexpensive, says the company's president Paul Adams, because it transmits intwo directions over simplex cabling without using multiplexing.andP;  Becausephotons are so small, they do not collide, and Raycom was forced to use200-micron cable.andP;  &quot;We thought users could cut their costs by running asingle fiber instead of two.andP;  Unfortunately, it did not work out that way.andO;Eventually, we discontinued the simplex product because of its high price,&quot;says Adams.andM;Fiber optic Arcnet cards are by far the most plentiful of the interfacecards.andP;  Virtually, every Arcnet manufacturer has a fiber optic version oftheir card.andP;  Aquila, Corman Technologies, Lanmaster, SMC, Tiara andThomas-Conrad are just a few.andM;The Thrill of SpeedandM;FDDI, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface, describes a 100M-bits-per-secondfiber optic LAN.andP;  ANSI is currently working on a standard which should emergein about six months.andP;  When products become commercially available, they willbe expensive.andP;  If you need high bandwidth today, there are a number ofnon-FDDI, high speed LANs available today.andM;Proteon's ProNET-80 is optimized for fiber.andP;  The 80M-bits-per-second networkuses token passing to achieve the high speeds.andP;  It implements a logical ringover a physical star topology, much like 802.5 Token Ring.andP;  A maximum of 240nodes is supported.andP;  They can be separated by two kilometers of cabling fromend to end.andP;  The hub costs between $335 and $1,000.andP;  The interface cards costbetween $4,900 to $10,400.andM;Artel manufactures a 100M-bits-per-second fiber optic LAN called FiberWay.andO;It uses token passing to provide a high speed link between devices.andP;  UsingArtel's Ethernet transceiver, Ethernet devices can also operate overFiberWay.andP;  The Accelerator uses a Motorola 68000 processor to append thetoken passing information to the Ethernet packets.andP;  Entire Ethernetsubnetworks can be connected via a MAC-layer bridge.andP;  FiberWay's bandwidth isdivided into 25M-bits-per-second bands using time division multiplexing.andO;Users have the option of combining these four channels in increments of 25M,although the full bandwidth can not be used for a single channel.andP;  By year'send Artel will incorporate a T-1 link with FiberWay.andP;  The T1 Link will use asingle 25M-bits-per-second channel to enable voice communication over thenetwork.andP;  Artel has no plans to become FDDI-compliant.andP;  The cost for afour-port node is around $10,000.andP;  An eight-port node is $12,000.andM;Thomas-Conrad is developing its own high speed network called TCNS, which isexpected to operate at 100M bits per second.andP;  TCNS will use existing Arcnetdrivers, making it compatible with many networks including Novell NetWare,Banyan Vines, Western Digital ViaNet and others.andP;  A maximum of 255 nodesspread out over six kilometers will be supported.andP;  PC cards will averagearound $1,000.andP;  The network is scheduled to ship in 1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
