KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Foreign Relations Committeerecommended overwhelmingly Wednesday that the Senate ratify ahistoric treaty to eliminate all U.S. and Soviet medium-rangenuclear weapons.   ``This is a small step away from the nuclear brink,'' said Sen.Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said following the committee's 17-2 vote.   ``It means the elevator of nuclear escalation will finally stopand hopefully descend,'' said committee chairman Claiborne Pell,D-R.I.   Cranston said his head count shows no more than five senatorswill vote against the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty whenthe full Senate takes up the treaty, probably late next month.Ratification requires a two-thirds Senate majority, 67 votes if all100 senators are present and voting.   The only dissenting votes inside the committee were cast bySens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D. Helms hasworked vigorously to derail the treaty.   The resounding committee vote papered over a bitter partisandispute over an amendment added to the treaty on Tuesday with theaim of assuring that the meaning of the pact cannot bereinterpreted by a future president without the consent of Congress.   Many moderate Republicans said the amendment represented apartisan jab at President Reagan and his administration'sreinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty topermit the deployment of a Star Wars missile defense system.   Several GOP lawmakers said the controversy may cause them toreassess their support of the treaty and Cranston said he may bewilling to search for a compromise when the Senate debates theissue.   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev, requires both sides to destroy, within threeyears, all nuclear-armed missiles with a range of 300 miles to3,400 miles.   These include all Soviet SS-20 and other medium- andshorter-range missiles aimed at targets in Western Europe and allof the smaller force of U.S. Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruisemissiles stationed in Europe and aimed at the Soviet Union.   The treaty is the first accord in the history of arms control torequire the actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclearwarheads. And it is the first to require on-site inspection toverify compliance with its terms.   The Foreign Relations Committee voted after 21 days of hearingsin which scores of expert witnesses testified. The SenateIntelligence and Armed Services committees also conducted anintense examination of the agreement and recommended it be adopted,the latter voting its approval, 18-2.   The Armed Services Committee did express some lingeringconcerns, and in final testimony on Wednesday, Ambassador MaynardGlitman, the chief U.S. INF negotiator, responded to them.   Glitman said ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers and particlebeam generators are in fact banned by the treaty if they arecarried on ``weapons delivery vehicles'' within the prohibitedrange.   The Soviets, the ambassador said, ``understand that all future(weapons) systems falling within the criteria will be banned.''   And if an unarmed medium-range missile were to strike anddestroy a target through impact alone, it would be considered aweapon if it had been designed for that purpose, he said.   Later, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, saidGlitman's statement had not resolved the issue and that he wouldseek a more definitive clarification during Senate debate.   Nunn said he might seek passage of an amendment to the treatyrequiring the administration to obtain a specific statement fromthe Soviets acknowledging that they had agreed not to produce,deploy or flight test futuristic medium-range weapons.   Pell told a news conference this issue is one of several hurdlesfacing the treaty on the Senate floor. He said he is hopeful allobstacles can be overcome and the treaty ratified before Reagan'ssummit meeting with Gorbachev in late May.   If it is not, he said, Reagan will be embarrassed and in aweakened position to pursue the far more significant Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty aimed at cutting U.S. and Soviet intercontinentalmissile forces by up to 50 percent.   Republican senators complained at length about the committee's12-7 decision on Tuesday to add the provision aimed at ensuringthat administration testimony and official description of thetreaty is ``authoritative'' and binding.   The provision says no future president can change the U.S.interpretation of the treaty without congressional approval, eitherby Senate ratification of a new treaty or by the House and Senatepassing a separate law.   ``It very frankly may change my position in response to thetreaty,'' said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., contending the measurewas aimed at the Strategic Defense Initiative and theadministration's reinterpretation of the ABM treaty.   Cranston said the measure was worded to apply only to the INFtreaty, not to any other pact or to future accords.   But Boschwitz insisted it was politically motivated. ``I thinkwe are making a great mistake. It weakens the value of the treatyvery substantially. I would hope that on the floor of the Senate wewould be able to remove this provision.''   Pressler called the amendment, ``mischievous and partisan.''   ``It will lead to the defeat of this treaty entirely because(with it), the votes aren't there,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
