My disposition depends on theindustrial base factor.;    I don't know what the industrial base factor is,but it has something to do with the current dispute over the Seawolf. I didn'teven know what the Seawolf was until recently. You can pay attention only toso many things, and I kind of put the Seawolf on the back burner.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NAME YOUR WEAPON -- SAY, THE NOSE-HAIR YANKER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  McEnroe is a columnist for the Hartford, Conn., Courant.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Seawolf, according to informed sources at my local doughnut shop, is yetanother massive, expensive piece of military equipment, similar to NormanSchwarzkopf, except that the Seawolf can stay underwater longer and is not asavailable for parades and &quot;Hollywood Squares.&quot;;    It was kind ofdisappointing to learn that the Seawolf is just another lousy submarine,instead of some massive, yellow-eyed, slobbering, underwater atomic canine --perhaps explicitly based on my dog Roy -- padding silently along the oceanfloor only to rear up at the shores of our enemies and throw up pine needleson their coastal cities.;    That's just it. As wars become less and lesspractical to arrange, what with there being hardly anybody worth fighting, ourdefense industry should begin to refocus its efforts on weapons that are notso much dangerous as entertaining.;    Wouldn't it be great, the next timeFrench Prime Minister Edith Cresson makes some ill-chosen remark suggestingthat Pee-wee Herman is more representative of American manhood than mostpeople realize, if George Bush could pick up the phone and say, &quot;Edith, Iregret to inform you that I've scrambled 300,000 TS-42 Greek Salad-EatingUltrasonic Robot Strike Pigeons, and they're headed your way.&quot;;    In fact,maybe it's not even necessary to build weapons. One of my potentially NobelPrize-winning peace proposals is that future wars be fought not with weaponsbut merely with names of weapons. Each nation would think up fivescary-sounding weapons. The leaders from each side would meet and read thenames of those weapons. An independent tribunal would decide whose werebetter.;    &quot;OK, we'll lead off with 5,000 Shrieking Troll X-100 Rotary HeadImploders.&quot;;    &quot;Foolish infidel, it is a simple matter to counter with our2,300 Blood-Gargling Gila Monster Abscess R-14 Attack Eye-Watering Nose-HairYankers.&quot;;    &quot;Yes, but we come back with our 12,000 Infected Cobra AD-47Exposed Wire Gum-Piercing Root Canal Electrodes.&quot;;    &quot;A bold move, godlessones, but we will merely call in our 4,000 Snub-Nosed Rabid Tapeworm Fast-FoodRestaurant Employee Assault Spatulas.&quot;;    &quot;Well, we didn't want to do this,but you force us to use our Telephone Solicitation Guy.&quot;;    &quot;Not . . . not .. . the one who calls up at dinner. . . .&quot;;    &quot;Yes.&quot;;    &quot;And . . . talksabout airline travel discounts . . . for frozen food purchases . . . deliveredto your door . . . in return for circus tickets . . . for underprivilegedchildren . . . so that you cannot figure out what exactly he is trying to sellyou, never mind how to get rid of him.&quot;;    &quot;The very same.&quot;;    &quot;Aiieeee. Wesurrender. You can have South Carolina back.&quot;;    &quot;Give us the Sahara desert,too.&quot;;    &quot;No problem.&quot;;    &quot;And pick up the rest of Mike Marshall's contractwith the Red Sox.&quot;;    &quot;Yes, yes, let me get you a soft drink.&quot;;    But youcan tell that a company such as Electric Boat, one of the two potential makersof the Seawolf, would be of no use to us in a names race. Look at its ownname. Electric Boat. Is that pathetic or what? It's as if Boeing called itselfBig Plane.;    If Electric Boat were to install me as the exorbitantlycompensated head of its new names division -- just to throw out a randomhypothesis -- my first act would be to rename the whole company something likeJim's World of Amphibious Havoc, a name that manages to suggest neighborlyfriendliness and the capacity to obliterate Belgium in an eye blink.;    ThenI would train my Screaming Dung Beetle D-11 Particle Beam Sinus Exfoliator onthe industrial base factor and write my name with laser damage on that sucker.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Colin McEnroe column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910810  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  702  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 10, 199100223135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
