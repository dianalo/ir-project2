But had he tried his hostile leveraged buy-out elsewhere in Europe, he probably never would have gotten started.    &quot;It will be a long time before the transaction methods practiced in the Anglo-Saxon systems will be used on the continent,&quot; says Martin Waldenstrom, president of Booz-Allen Acquisition Services, a unit of Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc. &quot;There are different systems of raising liquidity, market funding and corporate controls.&quot;    Indeed, despite predictions that takeover fever would sweep the continent in the wake of Sir James's bid for B.A.T, there are plenty of reasons why it won't, at least not for a while. For one thing, hostile takeovers, let alone ones involving huge debt that can be repaid only by selling assets, are still largely anathema. And the few European raiders -- like Italy's Carlo De Benedetti, who launched a hostile assault last year on Societe Generale de Belgique -- have usually had their wings clipped. Governments' inclination to intervene and limits on shareholders' rights in several countries ensure that.    Nonetheless, Sir James's move on B.A.T is likely to have an impact on business on the continent. Some businessmen say his bid could accelerate corporate restructurings as managements try to do themselves what a raider might attempt.    And there will be merger activity -- some of it unfriendly -- as European companies prepare for the European Community's planned barrier-free internal market after 1992. Already, mergers and acquisitions activity on the continent has picked up over the past two years, and such techniques as leveraged buy-outs have begun appearing. But much of this restructuring is likely to take the form of alliances, joint ventures or friendly takeovers rather than aggressive, debt-financed raids, businessmen say.    &quot;There's much more sympathy for transactions that aim to develop companies than for financial operations where you take over a company, sell nine-tenths or all of it and keep the profit,&quot; says Patrick Ponsolle, managing director of France's Cie. Financiere de Suez, which acted as a white knight to defeat Mr. De Benedetti in the epic Generale de Belgique battle.    With Anglo-Saxon ideas slowly gaining ground, however, there will be the occasional big raid or buy-out. &quot;Within two, four or six years, Goldsmith-style raids will come to continental Europe,&quot; says Alain Minc, vice chairman of Cerus S.A., Mr. De Benedetti's French holding company. &quot;People have built up a sociological system of defense, but this can't resist the wind of the market.&quot;    Even before then, some supposedly friendly takeovers will be less friendly than they seem, like Bernard Arnault's move last year on luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. &quot;Everybody will appear reluctant to appear as a raider and will try to make it look user-friendly,&quot; says Yves-Andre Istel, vice chairman of Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., the mergers and acquisitions concern.    He and others predict that after Britain, the next likely setting for such activity will be the more open countries, such as France. Prime targets could be diversified groups that can be broken up, such as Cie. de Navigation Mixte, whose capital structure is fragile, or Financiere de Suez. Mammoth companies elsewhere, such as West Germany's Siemens AG or Switzerland's Nestle S.A., may be tempting targets but are well-protected.    But in the meantime, the emphasis in corporate restructurings will be on building a bigger share of Europe's post-1992 unified market. &quot;Many businesses are looking for European size and are busier trying to work out alliances than attacking each other,&quot; says Michel Francois-Poncet, chairman of Cie. Financiere de Paribas, the French banking group, which is nevertheless supporting Sir James in his B.A.T bid. &quot;Energies are more focused on that than playing a pure financial game. We're more in the U.S. of 1975 than the U.S. of the 1980s.&quot;    At the same time, executives say, by raising the takeover stakes Sir James is forcing European businessmen to think hard about refocusing their businesses and improving returns to shareholders. Since markets here generally put a higher value on better-focused companies, executives in diversified groups might face shareholder pressure to sell off parts.    &quot;If the B.A.T bid succeeds, it would set a new tone, and even if it doesn't it will set new thoughts in motion,&quot; says Mr. Istel of Wasserstein Perella, which was on the losing side in the recent $3.5 billion unfriendly leveraged buy-out of the British supermarket chain Gateway Corp. &quot;The notion of shareholder value will have to be taken into account.&quot;    Adds Percy Barnevik, chief executive of ABB ASEA Brown Boveri, the giant Zurich-based industrial equipment maker: &quot;In Europe, a lot of resigned shareholders get lousy dividends. Managements sit on cash hoards. Companies say they've gotten a 1% or 2% return on assets for 30 years, so why can't they go on doing this? The pressure against this is healthy, so healthy that we might have to put up with some unpleasant aspects of the process, like these raiders.&quot;    &quot;Restrictions (on takeovers) don't last forever,&quot; says Albrecht Matuschka, a Munich management consultant and investor. &quot;The higher the barriers to the takeovers get, the greater the difference between the quoted price and the potential value of these protected companies gets, so the greater incentive for somebody with money to go after them. There will continue to be pressure on managements, a warning finger pointed at them saying they should use all their management tools to restructure from within.&quot;    Already, there are signs that some of these protective barriers are cracking, if not crumbling. In Switzerland, the practice of limiting foreign shareholdings is fading. Increasingly, foreigners are treated on an equal basis with Swiss shareholders, although many companies, such as Nestle, still retain the right to limit any single shareholder to 3%.    And in West Germany, regarded by many as the most impenetrable corporate network in Western Europe, banks are under pressure to reduce their dominant stakes in companies -- even though they retain other ways of keeping undesirable bidders out, such as restricting available financing. Still, many think that West Germany can't resist forever. Some bankers and businessmen think Germany could be ripe for hostile takeovers and even LBOs because its cozy protection system has spared many companies the restructuring other European concerns have had to undertake.    &quot;There will be pressure from the outside to change the system of protecting companies,&quot; predicts ABB's Mr. Barnevik. &quot;In the U.S., companies have to defend themselves. In Europe, they run to their governments. This will gradually change here, and we'll see more unfriendly takeovers not just in the U.K.&quot;    Will the Nestles and Siemenses stay shielded? &quot;There is nothing fundamental standing in the way of a raid against companies like that one day,&quot; Mr. Waldenstrom says. &quot;But the continental system makes it slower and harder because it is more institutionalized. Investing institutions are more industrial partners, which gives them longer perspectives on creating shareholder value.&quot;    ---@ Most Favored Nation    Value of foreign acquisitions in major European countries in first half of 1989 @ VALUE @ (in billions PERCENT @ of dollars) OF TOTAL @ Britain ............. $6.65 39% @ France .............. 2.57 15 @ Italy ............... 2.28 13 @ West Germany ........ 1.98 12 @ Spain ............... 1.20 7 @ The Netherlands ..... 0.57 3 @ All Western Europe .. 17.23 100 </TEXT></DOC>
