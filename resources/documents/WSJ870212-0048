Richard F. Sherman resigned as president and chief executive yesterday to pursue a possible takeover of the highly successful San Antonio, Texas, fast-food company. &quot;We're establishing an arm's length relationship with Mr. Sherman,&quot; said an adviser to Church's board.    It wasn't immediately clear whether Mr. Sherman had cast his lot with the acquisition-minded C. Stephen Lynn, president and chief executive of closely held Sonic Industries Inc., an Oklahoma City-based fast-food hamburger chain. Mr. Lynn last week made an overture to acquire Church's and proposed meeting with Church's officials, but Church's representatives insisted at the time that the proposal was far too ambiguous to merit a formal response.    It didn't appear that Mr. Sherman had yet formulated a detailed proposal. Church's shares closed yesterday at $14.25, up $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Based on its 37.8 million shares outstanding, the company's shares have a market value of about $539 million.    Mr. Sherman is understood to have proposed a leveraged buyout or some other reorganization proposal prior to the overture from Sonic. However, the emergence of Sonic's interest in taking over Church's &quot;accelerated&quot; Mr. Sherman's own desire to do the same, the Church's adviser said.    Whatever the intentions of the departed president, they certainly appeared to conflict with those of the company's board. &quot;I think what this shows is that there isn't unanimity among senior management about whether the company should pursue a leveraged buyout&quot; or any other type of going-private proposal, said Steven A. Rockwell, an analyst at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, Baltimore.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    The 43-year-old Mr. Sherman, a lawyer, joined Church's two years ago after serving as an executive vice president at a U.S. unit of Canada's Imasco Ltd., a tobacco and retailing concern. He was recruited to the company by J. David Bamberger, Church's largest shareholder and one of its founders. Mr. Bamberger left the company for 10 years and rejoined it as chairman in 1983 amid the first earnings decline in the company's history.    The company said yesterday that Mr. Bamberger had assumed Mr. Sherman's duties as president and chief executive. Both were were in meetings throughout the day and failed to return phone messages.    Church's operates a network of about 1,500 fried-chicken restaurants, primarily in blue-collar and inner-city areas. Several years ago it was judged the fastest-growing company in the nation by Financial World magazine.    Although advisers say Mr. Bamberger has never ruled out selling Church's, neither has he ever expressed much enthusiasm about doing so. In recent years Church's has entertained takeover proposals from several suitors, one adviser said, but in each case the proposed terms fell far short of the company's view of a fair price.    Mr. Bamberger has been particularly vocal against leveraged buyouts. Such buyouts, he once declared, are &quot;thievery by management.&quot;    A representative for Sonic and Mr. Lynn, Clifford Hudson, has declined to provide any details about the acquisition proposal or how financing would be obtained. But executives familiar with Mr. Lynn's leveraged buyout of Sonic last year said he had a &quot;tough time&quot; coming up with financing for the $10.2 million transaction.    Mr. Hudson and other representatives for Mr. Lynn couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
