Defense attorney Richard Beckler said Friday that Bush and Reaganhave information relevant to the criminal charges against Poindexter.   The same effort to subpoena Bush and Reagan was made in the trialof former White House aide Oliver North. But U.S. District CourtJudge Gerhard Gesell quashed the subpoenas.   Gesell said there was no proof North received authorization fromReagan to engage in illegal conduct, and he said North failed todemonstrate that Bush, who was Reagan's vice president, had anyrelevant information.   Poindexter, unlike North, met daily with Reagan, and so may havemore solid legal grounds for asking the former president to testify.   In other legal action Friday, prosecutors said they will seek tonarrow the scope of criminal charges against Poindexter.   Associate independent counsel Christian Mixter told U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Harold Greene that after the charges are narrowed``there would be no reason to involve'' Bush and Reagan in the trial.   Prosecutors want to cut the size of the Poindexter case in anattempt to avoid the kind of protracted legal battle over classifiedinformation that nearly derailed the North trial.   To be abandoned will be portions of a conspiracy count that delveinto the diversion of Iran arms sale money to the Contra rebelstrying to overthrow the leftist government in Nicaragua.   The remaining four counts against Poindexter accuse him ofobstructing and making false statements to Congress in connectionwith North's secret resupply operation for the Contras and a 1985arms shipment to Iran.   Prosecutors also moved to dismiss far-reaching conspiracy andtheft charges against Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord.   Secord was enlisted by North to run arms to the Contras during acongressional ban on military aid to the rebels.   In court papers, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said hewished to avoid the same legal fight over state secrets that loomedin the Poindexter case. Federal agencies are reluctant to giveSecord access to classified documents to prepare his defense.   Secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuityto North by arranging to set up a $200,000 Swiss bank account forhis children and by financing installation of a $13,800 securitysystem outside North's suburban Virginia home.   Secord also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressionalhearings on the Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
