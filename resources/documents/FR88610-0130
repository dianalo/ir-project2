The Plan is a profit sharing plan having approximately 1,027 participantsand total assets of $2,205,448 as of August 31, 1987. The Employer, thesponsor of the Plan, is a corporation engaged primarily in the food serviceand restaurant business in the State of Hawaii. 2. The subject Property is located in the Moanalua light industrial sectionof Honolulu near Honolulu International Airport. The Property is comprisedof two lots (Lot 104 and Lot 105) with a total land area of 44,959 squarefeet, both of which were acquired prior to passage of the Act in 1974,and improvements consisting of a two-story combination flight kitchen,warehouse and office building constructed on about 22,000 square feet ofthe Property. Lot 104 was purchased from an unrelated party, while Lot105 was purchased from the Employer. The improvements were constructedon the Property with Plan funds before passage of the Act. The Property(including the land) is currently leased to Sky Chefs, a division of FlagshipInternational, Inc. (Flagship) and is subleased to American Pacific TransportCompany, Ltd. (American Pacific). The applicant represents that Flagshipand American Pacific are unrelated to the Plan and to the Employer. Thepresent rent for the Property is $136,992 per annum, to be renegotiatedafter December 31, 1995. The lease is scheduled to terminate twenty yearsafter that date. The current lessee built an additional warehouse structureon the land in 1970. That additional warehouse is not owned by the Planand is not involved in the proposed transaction. 3. The Plan obtained an appraisal on the Property on February 23, 1987(supplemented by a letter dated December 18, 1987) from Larry Medeiros(Medeiros), a real estate appraiser located in Honolulu. The applicantrepresents that Medeiros is independent of the Plan and the Employer. Thepurpose of the appraisal is to estimate the fair market value of the leasedfee interest (lessor's interest) in the Property under the existing lease.The applicant represents that the value of the lessor's interest ratherthan a fee simple valuation is the relevant value because the Propertyis being sold subject to an existing lease to parties unrelated to thePlan or the Employer. Medeiros made a search of land values in the immediateareas of the Property for recent comparable transactions involving thetransfer of fee interests of properties under similar zoning. Placing emphasison the income approach to value, Medeiros capitalized the current and expectedrental income on the Property and added to that figure the lessor's interestin the leased land. Accordingly, Medeiros estimated that the fair marketvalue of the lessor's interest in the Property (including the improvementsowned by the Plan) as of January 1, 1987, was approximately $1,500,000.4. In a letter dated January 30, 1987, the Honolulu area office of theDepartment concluded, as a result of an investigation of the activitiesof the Plan, that the Property accounted for too high a percentage of Planassets and that the investments of the Plan were not sufficiently diversified.Thus, the Plan proposes to sell the Property to the Employer. The Employerwill pay no less than current fair market value for the Property at thetime of sale, based on an updated independent appraisal. The sale willbe entirely for cash, and the Plan will pay no commissions or fees in regardto the transaction. The Property will be sold subject to the existing lease,which will be transferred to the Employer at the time of sale. The Planwill reinvest the proceeds of the sale in assets which should produce asmuch or more income and appreciation for the Plan and which should increasethe diversification of Plan investments. 5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction willsatisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1)The sale of the Property will be entirely for cash and the Plan will payno commissions or fees in connection with the sale; (2) the Employer willpay no less than current fair market value for the Property, based on anupdated independent appraisal; (3) the proceeds of the sale will be reinvestedin assets which should produce as much or more income and appreciationas the Property; and (4) the transaction will increase the diversificationof the assets of the Plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact: </T2>Paul Kelty of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8883.

The Plan is a defined contribution thrift plan covering approximately4,013 paticipants as of December 22, 1987. As of December 31, 1986, thePlan's assets totalled $48,732,656.17. Investment decisions for the Planare made by Meridian Investment Company (the Investment Manager), a subsidiaryof the Sponsor. Meridian Trust Company (the Trustee), another subsidiaryof the Sponsor, is the trustee of the Plan.2. Partnership 1 was formed to provide a $1,300,000 second mortgage loanto Plantation Place Associates, Ltd. (Borrower 1), a limited partnershipformed for the purpose of acquiring a 184-unit garden apartment complexlocated in Arlington, Texas. The loan requires quarterly payments of interestonly at the rate of 13% per annum on the outstanding principal balancethereof, which is due on March 1, 1990. Although the loan is without recourseto the borrower, it is secured by a second lien on the apartment complexand is personally guaranteed by the husband of the general partner of Partnership1. The first mortgage on the property is approximately $2,760,000. Theapplicants represent that Mrs. Phyllis A. Katz (Mrs. Katz), the generalpartner of Partnership 1, is not a party in interest with respect to thePlan and that neither the Sponsor nor any of its subsidiaries had any dealingswith Mrs. Katz prior to the Plan's acquisition of the Units.3. Partnership 2 was formed to provide a $2,100,000 first lien mortgageloan to Winston Apartments Company (Borrower 2) for a 112-unit garden apartmentproject in San Antonio, Texas. When Partnership 2 made its commitment toissue its permanent loan in 1980, the project had not yet been constructed.The project was completed and the mortgage loan was funded in May 1981.The permanent loan is a first mortgage loan providing for quarterly paymentsof interest only at the rate of 12% per annum on outstanding principalbalance of the loan, which is due in full on December 31, 1991. The loanis without recourse to the borrower. The applicants represent that Mr.Aaron B. Katz (Mr. Katz), the general partner of Partnership 2 (and thehusband of Mrs. Katz), is not a party in interest with respect to the Planand that neither the Sponsor nor any of its subsidiaries had any dealingswith Mr. Katz prior to the Plan's acquisition of the Units.4. In 1985, Meridian Title Insurance Company, a wholly-owned participatingsubsidiary of the Sponsor, acquired substantially all the assets of CongressTitle Corporation, of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which had theretofore maintainedthe Congress Title Corporation Profit Sharing Plan (the CTC Plan). As partof this acquisition, the CTC Plan was terminated, its assets (totallingapproximately $923,000) were transferred to the Plan's Fund B, which investsprimarily in certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and notes, and othershort-term investments. The Units were among the assets transferred tothe Plan effective April 1, 1986, although they were not actually receivedby the Plan until approximately July 1, 1986. The face value of the Unitin Partnership 1 was $65,000; that of the Unit in Partnership 2 was $83,160.(These face values equal the amounts of capital contributed to the Partnershipsby the CTC Plan). When the Units were transferred to the Plan, the InvestmentManager reviewed the private placement memoranda and certain other documentsforwarded by the trustees of the CTC Plan. Appraisal reports dated November5, 1985, for the projects owned by the Partnerships were among the documentsreceived. The Sponsor and the Trustee did not question the appropriatenessof the Plan's investment in the Units because, among other things, theyappeared to be the equivalent of secured loans structured to yield returnsof 13% and 12%, respectively.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Department is expressing no opinion herein as to whetherthe acquisition and holding of the Units violated any provision of Part4, Subtitle B, of Title I of the Act.5. Although quarterly distributions were made by each of the Partnershipsthrough the second quarter of 1986, reflecting corresponding debt servicepayments under the loans from the Partnerships, no further distributionswere made due to defaults under these loans. The Plan continued to accruethe scheduled quarterly distributions as income, however, in accordancewith its regular accounting procedures. Correspondence received in late1986 and early 1987 from the general partners of both Partnerships indicatedthat, as a result of a serious downturn in the rental real estate marketin the southwestern United States, the loans to both Partnerships couldnot be repaid under their existing terms. Partnership 2's limited partnerswere asked to accept a reduced rate of repayment. For the loan from Partnership1, abatement and modification of debt service for two years or less wasrequested. The Plan has received no further communication regarding theseloans from the general partners of the Partnerships.6. In early 1987 after receiving the above mentioned communications fromthe general partners of the Partnerships, the Trustee, the Investment Manager,and the Sponsor focused upon the deteriorating conditions of both Partnershipsand determined that: (a) Quarterly distributions from both Partnershipswere in default; (b) there was no market for the Units; (c) by their terms,the Units were not freely transferable; (d) the depressed economic conditionsin the areas where the Partnerships' projects were located had materiallyimpaired the value of the Units; (e) the Plan could not continue to carrythe Units at face value; (f) the Units may not have been appropriate investmentsfor the Plan's Fund B, and the quality and risks associated with the Unitswere not fully explained to the Plan's fiduciaries; (g) the participantsin the Plan's Fund B should not bear the loss from these deterioratinginvestments; and (h) it was not in the best interest of the Plan and itsparticipants and beneficiaries to keep the Units in the Plan. Therefore,on March 31, 1987, the Trustee, upon direction of the Investment Manager,transferred the Units to the Sponsor, which paid the Plan cash in the amountof $157,374.60, representing the combined face values of the Units ($65,000+ $83,160) plus quarterly distributions accrued but unpaid on the Unitsfrom July 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986 ($9,214.60). The amount ofunpaid quarterly distributions accrued for the period January 1, 1987 throughMarch 31, 1987 was excluded from the price paid by the Sponsor on March31, as the Plan had not then accrued such distributions on its books. However,in March 1988 the Sponsor paid the Plan $4,607.30 by check, representingthe aggregate amount of the unpaid accrued distributions on the Units forthe period January 1, 1987 through March 31, 1987 (i.e.: $2,112.50 duefrom Partnership 1 plus $3,494.80 due from Partnership 2). According tothe Trustee, the Plan did not pay any commissions or other expenses inregard to effecting the sale of the Units to the Sponsor, and the costsincurred by the Plan with respect to the Units from the time the Plan acquiredthem to the date of transfer to the Sponsor are so minimal as to be unascertainable.7. Formal transfer of the ownership of the Units on the books of the Partnershipswas effected as of March 31, 1988, after obtaining the required consentof the general partners thereof. Prior to that date, the Plan and the Sponsoragreed that even if the general partners would not consent to said formaltransfer, the Plan and the Sponsor would, as between themselves, treatthe Units as having been purchased by the Sponsor and would file all requiredtax returns on that basis. The applicants have sought counsel as to whetherthe sale of the Units on March 31, 1987 without the prior approval of thegeneral partners of the Partnerships is a valid and legally binding saleas between the Plan and the Sponsor. They have obtained an opinion of counselconcluding that the sales on March 31, 1987 of the Units by the Plan tothe Sponsor constitute legally binding and valid sales as between the Planand the Sponsor. 8. Mr. Milton Slater, Vice President for Investor Relations of AmericanResidential Properties, Inc., which represents the general partners ofthe Partnerships, has confirmed that as a result of the soft market conditionsin Texas where both of the properties financed by the Partnerships arelocated, the fair market values of the Units did not exceed (and may havebeen considerably lower than) their face values as of March 31, 1987. Theapplicants represent that the difference, if any, between the fair marketvalue of the Units on March 31, 1987 and the amounts paid by the Sponsorto the Plan on that date and in March of 1988 as the purchase price forthe Units will not disqualify the Plan if such payments are subsequentlydetermined to be employer contributions for purposes of the limitationsimposed by the Code. 9. In summary, the applicants represent that the sale of the Units to theSponsor by the Plan satisfies the exemption criteria set forth in section408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Investment Manager and the Trusteesdetermined that it would be in the best interests of the Plan and its participantsand beneficiaries to dispose of the Units to avoid having the participantsand beneficiaries bear the loss from these deteriorating investments becausetheir value had been impaired and they were producing no income, had nomarket, and were not freely transferable; (b) the sale price paid by theSponsor on March 31, 1987 was not less than the fair market value of theUnits on that date; (d) the Sponsor represents that the Plan would notbe disqualified if the difference between (i) the combined fair marketvalues of the Units on March 31, 1987, and (ii) the amounts paid to thePlan by the Sponsor on March 31, 1987 and in March 1988, were treated asemployer contributions for purposes of the limitations imposed by the Code;and (e) the Plan did not pay any commissions or other expenses in regardto effecting the sale of the Units to the Sponsor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mrs. Miriam Freund of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.

George A. Malloch, Esq. (Mr. Malloch), of the San Francisco Law firmof Kaplan, Russin, Vecchi, Eytan andamp; Collins, independent fiduciary forthe Plan with respect to PTE 86-80, represents that the trustees and planadministrator of the Plan discharged their fiduciary responsibilities withrespect to PTE 86-80 fully, correctly, and timely; that the First Loanand Loan payments have been property accounted for by the Plan; and thatall Loan payments have been promptly paid when due.

The Plan is a profit sharing plan with 33 participants and total assetsconsisting of cash, securities, and the Property valued at $1,555,340.95,as of December 31, 1987. The plan was created on December 21, 1968, andon January 1, 1985, was ``frozen'' as to funding contributions and participants.With respect to the Plan, the latest favorable determination letter wasisued on September 9, 1987, by the Internal Revenue Service. The trusteefor the Plan is BANK IV Wichita, N.A. (the Trustee), formerly designatedas Fourth National Bank and Trust Company of Wichita.2. During 1985, the Bethel Clinic, Inc. (Bethel), which had been the sponsoringemployer of the Plan, was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary by WichitaClinic, P.A. (Wichita), a major health care enterprise with 500 employeesand located principally in Wichita, Kansas, At the time of this acquisition,only the 13 medical practitioners of Bethel became employees of Wichita;all other employees of Bethel ramained employees of Bethel. However, allemployees of Bethel, and the medical practitioners who transferred theiremployment to Wichita, became participants in the pension benefit plansof Wichita.3. The Trustee proposes to enter into a transaction in which the Plan willsell the Property to the Partnership for a cash amount which will be notless than the greater of either $450,000 or the fair market value of theProperty on the date of the Sale. All expenses and costs incurred by thePlan in acquiring and holding the Property will have been completely recoveredfrom the lease of the Property to Bethel pursuant to a prior exemptionand from the Sale. The applicant represents that the Sale will not onlyprovide an orderly liquidation and termination of the Plan, but will enablethe Plan to avoid disqualification by the Internal Revenue Service pursuantto section 401(a)(26) of the Code, if the Plan is maintained after December31, 1988. In addition, the applicant represents that the proposed transactionwill avoid a forced sale of the Property or a disorderly distribution inkind of Plan assets to Plan participants in the form of unmarketable fractionalinterests in the Property.4. The Property is a medical clinic and two single-family residences locatedon 1.31 acres at 201 Pine Street, 315 and 317 Southeast Second Street and202, 208, and 212 Harrison Street in Newton, Kansas. The Property was purchasedby the Plan for $407,100, and leased to Bethel, pursuant to an exemptionunder section 408(a) of the Act [<T3>See </T3>Prohibited Transaction Exemption 78-2, (PTE 78-2), 43 FR 7746,February 24, 1978]. The Trustee represents that all the requirements ofPTE 78-2 have been complied with since the exemption was granted. The Partnershipconsists of limited partners, who are the 13 medical practitioners transferredfrom Bethel to Wichita employment and a general partner, which is WichitaClinic Building Corporation (WCBC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wichita.The Wichita building facilities in Wichita, Kansas are owned by WCBC.5. The Trustee, a qualified, independent fiduciary with respect to thePlan, retained Mr. Roger P. Turner, MAI, a qualified, independent appraiser,with Roger Turner Company, Wichita, Kansas to appraise the Property. Mr.Turner determined that the Property had a fair market value of $450,000as of January 15, 1988. This appraisal was based upon the continued useof the clinic in conjunction with operation of the Newton Health Care BethelHospital, located across the street from the Property. At the time of theSale the Trustee will also select the independent appraiser to enable theTrustee to determine the consideration to be paid for the Property. TheTrustee, as independent fiduciary of the Plan, has found that the Saleis appropriate and in the best interests of the Plan and its participantsand beneficiaries.6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfiesthe criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because (a)the Sale will be a one-time transaction for cash with no expenses incurredby the Plan; (b) the Plan will sell the Property for the greater of $450,000or at its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser;and (c) the Plan will be able to terminate and distribute, in a timelymanner, benefits to its remaining participants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. C.E.

If the exemption is granted the restrictions ofsection 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resultingfrom the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposedcash sale by the Plan of certain Firearms (The Firearms) to Edward L. Andrews,M.D. (Dr. Andrews), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, providedthat the price paid is the higher of either the Plan's original purchaseprice for the Firearms, plus the expenses incurred by the Plan in connectionwith the holding and maintenance of the Firearms, or the fair market valueof the Firearms on the date of sale.  Summary of Facts and Representations  1. The Plans is a defined benefit plan which, as of August 31, 1987, hadseven participants and total assets of $1,226,000. The trustees of thePlan are Dr. Andrews and Theresa R. Andrews, his Wife (Mrs. Andrews; together,the Trustees).  2. The Plan's sponsor is Brentwood Orthopedics, Inc. (the Employer), locatedat 4110 Warrensville Center Road, Warrensville Heights, Ohio. The Employeris a professional corporation organized and operating under the laws ofthe State of Ohio. The Employer has been engaged in the practice of medicinesince August 27, 1970. The Employer adopted the Plan, effective August31, 1976. Dr. Andrews is an officer director, and the controlling shareholderof the Employer.  3. The applicant represents that the Plan is significantly overfunded andwill be terminated during 1988. Approximately 3% of the Plan's assets consistsof the Firearms. The Firearms are 34 commemorative Firearms, which werespecially manufactured to commemorate particular events and were producedin limited quantities. The applicant states that the Firearms are of investmentquality and were purchased and held solely as an investment for the Plan.\2\<NOTE/> The Firearms were purchased in lots of various size duringthe years 1977 to 1981. The Plan paid a total of $50,745 for the Firearms.The Firearms were all purcahsed from William R. Richman (Mr. Richman),FFL Dealer, Collector and Gun Appraiser, d/b/a Fort Defiance Colt CommemorativeFirearms in Defiance, Ohio. Mr. Richman is not related to Dr. Andrews,personally, or to the Employer.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\The Department is expressing no opinion as to whether theacquisition of the Firearms by the Plan violated any provision of Part4 of Title I of the Act.  The Firearms have been held, since their acquisition, by the Trustees.Specifically, the Trustees state that the Firearms have been located ina safe that Dr. Andrews had installed in his home for the purpose of holdingthe Firearms and have not been displayed to other persons. All expensesassociated with the holding of the Firearms have been charged to the Plan.However, the safe was not purchased with Plan assets, but by Dr. Andrews,individually, acting in his capacity as a Trustee of the Plan.  4. The Firearms were appraised on December 31, 1987 by Mr. Richman, anindependent, qualified appraiser, as having a wholesale market value of$37,675. By letter dated May 2, 1988, Mr. Richman states that the currentretail market value of the Firearms would be about 20-25% more than thestated wholesale market value. Thus, if the Firearms were sold with a retailmarkup of 25%, the fair market value of the Firearms would be approximately$47,093.75.  5. The applicant states that since the Plan will be terminating and distributionswill be made to the participants, it is necessary to liquidate the Plan'sassets. The applicant states further that a sale of the Firearms to anindependent party would involve a broker dealer, who would charge approximately10% of the sales price as a commission for his services. In addition, theFirearms may have to be sold singly or in smaller lots, which could reducethe total amount the Plan would receive. Therefore, Dr. Andrews proposesto purchase the Firearms directly from the Plan for cash at the higherof either the Plan's original purchase price for the Firearms, plus theexpenses incurred by the Plan in connection with the holding and maintenanceof the Firearms, or the fair market value of the Firearms as of the dateof the transaction. Mr. Richman states that he will update his appraisalfor the Firearms for purposes of the proposed transaction. The Plan wouldnot pay any brokerage commissions or other expenses with respect to thesale.  6. The Trustees believe that the proposed transaction would be in the bestinterest of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries. By sellingthe Firearms to Dr. Andrews, the Plan will be able to eliminate the problemsof finding multiple buyers and paying brokerage commissions. In addition,the Plan will be able to obtain a higher selling price for all of the Firearmsand avoid any delay in the distribution of the Plan's assets.  7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction willmeet the statutory requirements of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a)The sale will be a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan will receivethe greater of either the fair market value of the Firearms as determinedby an independent, qualified appraiser, or the original purchase pricepaid by the Plan for the Firearms, plus the expenses incurred by the Planin connection with the holding and maintenance of the Firearms; (c) thePlan will not be required to pay any brokerage commissions or other expenseswith respect to the sale; and (d) the Trustees have determined that thesale of the Firearms is in the best interest of the Plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. E.F.

Danner, M.D. (Dr. Danner),David A. Raetz, M.D. (Dr. Raetz), and Kenneth B. Reynard, M.D. (Dr. Reynard),of certain diamonds (the Diamonds) from their individually directed accountsin the Plan (the Accounts), provided that the sale price be no less thanthe retail fair market value of the Diamonds on the date of sale as establishedby an independent qualified appraiser.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan with individually directed separateaccounts, sponsored by Colorado Imaging Associates, P.C. (the Plan Sponsor),a Colorado professional corporation engaged in the practice of medicine,specializing in radiology. Dr. Goodman is the President, Drs. Danner andReynard are Vice-Presidents, and Dr. Raetz is the Secretary-Treasurer ofthe Plan Sponsor. Drs. Goodman, Danner, Raetz and Reynard are each 25%shareholders of the Plan Sponsor, and are also Trustees of the Plan. Drs.Danner and Raetz are also administrators of the Plan. As of February 15,1988, the Plan had eleven participants. As of June 30, 1987, the Plan hadnet assets of $2,513,326.2. The diamonds were purchased for $124,140 from unrelated third partiesin June and July of 1977 for general investment purposes. The Diamondshave not been used by the Plan or by any party in interest and have heldin a safe-deposit box in the name of the Trustees since their acquisitionby the Plan. Drs. Goodman, Danner, Raetz and Reynard have determined thatit is in their best interest and that of their Accounts to sell the Diamondsto themselves. In view of the weak gemstone market and the high expensesin selling the Diamonds to unrelated third parties, they have determinedthat the sale of the Diamonds to themselves would provide the greatestreturn to the Accounts at the lowest expense.3. On January 15, 1988, Edward H. Paul, of Cherry Creek Gems, Inc., anindependent qualified appraiser of gems in Denver, Colorado, based on anexamination of the original grading certificates of the Diamonds issuedby the Gemological Institute of America, and on examination of the Diamondsthemselves, estimated the fair retail market value of the Diamonds to be$236,209. Specifically, he set the fair market value of the four diamondsin Dr. Goodman's account at $107,632; of the two diamonds in Dr. Danner'saccount at $78,021; of the two diamonds in Dr. Raetz's account at $36,659;and the one diamond in Dr. Reynard's account at $13,897.4. Accordingly, the Plan proposes to sell the diamonds in the individuallydirected separate accounts of Drs. Goodman, Danner, Raetz and Reynard (theDoctors) in the Plan to the Doctors for cash for the fair market retailvalues of the Diamonds as established by an independent qualified appraiseras of the date of sale, with no costs or expenses to be paid by the Planor the Accounts.5. In sumary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions willsatisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Diamondswill be sold by the Accounts to the Doctors for their fair market retailvalues as determined by a qualified and independent appraiser as of thedate of sale; (b) the sale represents a one-time transaction for cash whichcan be easily verified; (c) neither the Plan nor the Accounts will incurany expense with respect to the sale; and (d) the Doctors, who are theonly participants whose individual accounts are affected by this proposedexemption, have determined that the proposed transaction would be in theinterest of their individual accounts in the Plan, and desire that thetransaction be consummated.<T3>Interest to Interested Persons: </T3>Because Drs.

If the exemption is granted the sanctions resultingfrom the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposed cashsale by the Plan of a certain parcel of unimproved real property and relatedwater rights (the Property) to Donald W. Brown, M.D. (Dr. Brown) and MargaretR. Brown, his wife (Mrs. Brown; together, the Browns) both of whom areparties in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the sales pricefor the Property is not less than the fair market value of the Propertyon the date of sale.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan which, as of June 30, 1987, had twoparticipants and total assets of $387,577.50. The Browns are the trusteesof the Plan (together, the Trustees).2. The Plan is sponsored by D.W. Brown, Inc. (the Employer), a Californiamedical corporation specializing in nuclear medicine. The Employer is locationat 3911 Dunster Way, Sacramento, California. Dr. Brown is the presidentand 100% shareholder of the Employer. The Browns are the only participantsin the Plan.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\Because the Browns are the only participants in the Planand the Employer is wholly-owned by Dr. Brown, there is no jurisdictionunder Title I of the Act pursuant to 29 CFR 2510.3-3(b). However, thereis jurisdiction under Title II of the Act pursuant to section 4975 of theCode.3. The Property consists of approximately 83 acres of unimproved flood-irrigatedfarmland, together with 9\1/4\ shares of related water rights in the HandyDitch Company. The Property is located at 1064 North County Road 17 inLarimer County Colorado. The Property was purchased by the Plan on February14, 1986 from P. Richardson, J. Wright and E. Price (the Sellers), allof whom are unrelated parties, for $165,680. The Plan paid $110,120 incash and gave a note (the Note) to the Sellers for $55,560 to cover thebalance of the purchase price. The Note bears interest at a rate of 9%per annum, beginning March 14, 1986, with monthly payments $447.05. A finalpayment on the Note in the amount of $50,133.89 will be due on January1, 1996. As of March 14, 1988, the principal balance on the Note was $54,728.87.The applicant states that as of February 28, 1988, the Plan had received$12,693.34 in income on the Property and had incurred total expenses, includinginterst on the Note, of $19,377.32.The Property is adjacent to another parcel of real property owned by theBrowns, in their individual capacities (the Adjacent Property). However,the applicant states that the Property has not been leased to, or otherwiseused by, the Browns or any other party in interest with respect to thePlan.4. The applicant represents that the Plan acquired the Property as an investment.However, there has been no net farm income from the Property for the Planbecause the prices for farm commodities which are produced by the Propertyhave been very low during the past few years. The applicant states thatprices for farm properties in Larimer County, Colorado, are being adverselyimpacted by a depressed farm economy. In addition, residential and commercialdevelopment in the nearby town of Berthoud, Colorado, has suffered froma downturn in the local economy. Therefore, the applicant states that itis unlikely that the Property will appreciate in value or that the Planwill realize any substantial income from the Property in the near future.5. The Property was appraised on March 30, 1988 by Lawrence I. Melton,Jr. and Barry J. Floyd, S.R.A., of the Northern Colorado Appraisal Companyin Loveland, Colorado (the Appraisal), as having a fair market value of$150,000. The appraisal includes a valuation of approximately $45,000 forthe related water rights on the Property. The Appraisal states that theProperty was appraised as if it were free and clear of mortgage indebtedness,assessments, and liens of any kind other than taxes. The Appraisal alsostates that the valuation of the Property has taken into considerationthe possible special value of the Property to the Browns as a result oftheir ownership of the Adjacent Property. However, the Appraisal concludesthat there is no ``special value'' of the Property to the Browns as a resultof the ownership of the Adjacent Property.6. The Browns propose to purchase the Property from the Plan for cash.The purchase price would be the greater of either the fair market valueof the Property or the sum of the total acquisition cost and total netcarrying costs to the Plan for the Property, as of the date of the transaction.The Appraisal will be updated as of the date of sale. As of February 28,1988, the approximate sum of the total acquisition cost and total net carryingcosts incurred by the Plan was $172,363.98. The Browns state that theywill assume all obligations and liabilities of the Plan under the Note.Therefore, the amount owed on the Note will be subtracted from the totalprice to be paid by the Browns for the Property, and cash equal to thedifference between the amount owed on the Note and the total proposed purchaseprice will be paid to the Plan.The applicant states that the proposed purchase price guarantees that thePlan will receive a net cash amount for the Property which is equal tothe total cash outlays of the Plan (i.e. the original purchase price plusexpenses, including interest paid on the Note) in connection with the Property,less any income received by the Plan on the Property as of the date ofsale. The Trustees represent that the proposed transaction would be inthe best interest of the Plan because the transaction will make the Plan``whole'' with respect to the total cost of the Property to the Plan asan investment. The applicant states that the proposed purchase price isgreatert than any price that currently could be obtained from an unrelatedparty. In addition, no brokerage commissions or other expenses will beincurred by the Plan in connection with the sale. Finally, the proposedtransaction will allow the Plan to reinvest the sale proceeds in investmentswhich yield substantially higher returns for the Plan than the Property.7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction willsatisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a)The sale will be a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan will receivean amount which is the greater of either the fair market value of the Property,as established by the Appraisal, or the total cash outlays of the Planin connection with the Property, less any income received by the Plan onthe Property as of the date of sale; (c) the Plan will not pay any commissionsor other expenses with respect to the sale; and (d) the Trustees, who arethe only participants in the Plan, have determined that the proposed saleis in the best interest of the Plan.<T3>Notice to Interested Persons:</T3> Because the Browns are the onlyparticipants in the Plan, it has been determined that there is no needto distribute the notice of proposed exemption to interested persons.
