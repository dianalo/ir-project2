(Dvorak vs. Seymour) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Dvorak, John C.; Seymour, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Two views of the potential value of grammar-checking software arepresented.andP;  One view argues that 'over the shoulder' software isvaluable because many office workers lack writing skills and canbenefit from computerized aid.andP;  Grammar checkers are not designedfor professional writers but for those who have been tricked intowriting the 'bureaucratese' that plagues political and corporateAmerica.andP;  No grammar checker can deal with individual stylecharacteristics, but grammar checkers are not designed to spot'inane' writing.andP;  The other viewpoint holds that good writinginvolves several levels of structure, exposition, expression, andstyle.andP;  Anyone well enough educated to know the difference betweengood writing and bad is most likely beyond the level of helpoffered by grammar-checking programs.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Grammar, Comparative and generalGrammar CritiquingSoftware packagesWriting SkillsUser Behavior.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Grammar Checkers: A Banquet, or Hamburger Helper? I'M CONVINCED that there'sa big future for what I call &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; software.andP;  Such softwareacts like a professor, a parent, or a boss, looking over your shoulder andtelling you when you've made a mistake.andM;Spell-checkers are just one of this breed.andP;  A decade ago, nobody knew what aspell-checker was.andP;  Today, they're the car cigarette lighters of wordprocessors.andP;  You get one whether you use it or not.andP;  Unlike a cigarettelighter, though, a spell-checker should be used by everyone.andP;  They catchrepeated words, typos, miskeying.andP;  They give you confidence.andP;  You train ofthought, after all, is more important than worrying about your falteringfingers.andP;  Indulge your inspiration and let the spell-checker catch the typos.andM;So what about grammar checkers?andP;  How can you possibly get all the elements ofgood grammar into a software package?andP;  Too many variations and exceptions.andO;On top of that, a grammar checker can't possibly deal with individual stylecharacteristics--at least, not with today's technology.andP;  So critics might saythat, given these limits, grammar checkers are useless.andM;To prove their point, critics might feed the grammar checker the followingparagraph: &quot;Kill all pig dog cops.andP;  Daisy is a flower.andP;  She stinks.andP;  BuyBurma Shave.andP;  Eat oatmeal and die.&quot;andP;  A senseless composition if there everwas one.andP;  Most grammar checkers, however, will diagnose a very readable,well-composed paragraph.andM;Nothing's perfect.andP;  But that misses the point.andP;  Today's grammar checker isn'tdesigned to spot the inane (or the insane!), and it might be useless forsomeone whose style is unusual, albeit correct.andM;But today's grammar checker isn't designed for the professional writer.andP;  It'sdesigned for the 24-year-old rookie at General Motors who, despite a B.S.andP;  inengineering and an M.B.A., can barely write a coherent sentence.andP;  It's foroffice workers who have been suckered into writing bureaucratese--themealy-mouthed phrasing and witless wording that's passed like the flu untilit plagues the writing styles of corporate and political America.andM;Grammar checkers do a fine job of fighting this trend, helping office workerscommunicate effective.andP;  This is what grammar packages are all about.andM;It would be great to have a perfect grammar checker that would assess how youwrite and what mistakes you commonly make and somehow account for style andcontent, too.andP;  I suppose someday we'll see something like that.andP;  I alwaysthought it would be fund to develop a programmable system that could rewriteyour report in the style of Saul Bellow or Norman Mailer at the click of amouse button.andP;  The computer would become the ultimate rewrite robot.andM;Jim, you and I and the others who'd get a kick out of such a tool are out ofluck--at least for the moment.andP;  But the office workers who have never fanciedthemselves writers could do worse than use computerized help.andP;  That's whothese packages are for.andP;  And they work well for their intended users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
