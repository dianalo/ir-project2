<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0209 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new technical option for the coal industry in dealing with the carbondioxide greenhouse effect has been devised. We have developed a veryefficient process called HYDROCARB/sup SM/, which effectively splitscoal into carbon and hydrogen. The process has been described in detail.We are suggesting that coal refineries be built based on this technology.The original thrust of this process is to produce a clean, pure carbonfuel from coal for application in both mobile and stationary heat engines.A co-product of the process is a hydrogen-rich gas. If one is concernedabout the greenhouse effect, then either all or part of the carbon canbe withheld and only the hydrogen is used as fuel. If one desires toattain the ultimate, and eliminate all CO{sub 2} emissions from coal,then all of the carbon can be stored and only the hydrogen used. Theoption is still open for utilizing the clean carbon, which would be placedin monitored retrievable storage, not unlike the strategic petroleumreserve (SPR). This concept can be valuable to the coal industry in responseto the arguments of the anti-coal critics. In this regard, we believethis process is unique; no other process can make this claim. We areconvinced that the HYDROCARB Process would be of substantial benefit,economically as well as environmentally, let alone psychologically, tothe coal and fossil fuel industry. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
