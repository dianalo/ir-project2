The SCERDC wanted toencourage the consideration of energy efficiency in railway managementdecisions. To facilitate this, a LOTUS 1-2-3 based program called CRIDA(Clemson Rail Investment Decision Analysis) was developed. CRIDA buildson the results of a completed project that yields information on energyconsumption of railway vehicles using LOTUS 1-2-3. The project resultedin a LOTUS 1-2-3 based program called CRCEP (Clemson Rail Car EnergyProgram). CRCEP permits the estimation of energy usage of rail cars dueto grades, aerodynamic losses, and energy lost across the wheel-railinterfaces during curving and negotiation of randomly irregular track.CRCEP is both route and car specific. The work reported in this paperexpands the usefulness of that already reported by applying investmentdecision analysis tools that enable us to translate the energy consumptionoutput into language understandable and usable by management decisionmakers. The tools implemented in CRIDA are not specific to use with CRCEP.Any analysis model or data from real trials can be input to CRIDA foranalysis.</TEXT></DOC>
