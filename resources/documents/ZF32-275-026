 Ancient human skills drive thevision of personal participation.andP;  Today's challenge is learning to doglobally distributed work.andP;  Tomorrow's challenge is to create smarter groups.andO;And threading through these views is the vision of a network science.andM;PERSONAL PARTICIPATION.andP;  Immense power exists in networks of myriad peoplevoluntarily interacting to effect a common cause.andP;  Networks are egalitarian.andO;Networks are a form of democracy, based on direct participation.andM;&quot;Egalitarian&quot; does not mean there is no leadership in networks.andP;  Indeed, insuccessful networks, there are many leaders.andP;  Network leadership is pluraland flexible.andP;  There is more opportunity for people to be leaders sincenetworks need more leaders than do hierarchies and bureaucracies.andM;Networks link work to personal values, the most compelling source ofmotivation without coercion.andP;  Leadership in a network cannot depend uponforce or policies for control.andP;  It is the appeal to shared values and commonpurpose that binds a network.andP;  People feel good about contributing in anetwork, feel valued by peers, and have an increased sense of self-worth.andM;&quot;Peer-to-peer&quot; describes the key network relationship between the individualand the group.andP;  The &quot;citizen&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; are equals in networks.andO;Autonomy and participation are complements.andP;  Networks support theindependence, integrity, and creativity of their members.andP;  At the same time,they serve the human need to be needed, to be part of a group, to feel securewith others.andM;It is this interdependent relationship between the individual and the groupthat is fundamental to a global network philosophy.andP;  In the West, it is theindividual that is emphasized; networking becomes a way to build newcooperative structures without losing individual creativity and initiative.andO;In the East, it is the group that is emphasized; networking becomes a way tolet people expand their identifies and take more responsibility withoutlosing group creativity and harmony.andM;Networking is a natural way for people to work and function in groups, butnew skills and ways of thinking about groups are needed to take advantage ofthe transforming technologies of our time.andM;GLOBABLLY DISTRIBUTED WORK.andP;  The great promise of today's networks isaccomplishing work with physically distributed groups, work traditionallydone by people in the same place.andM;Through distributed networks, people can &quot;think globally and act locally.&quot;andO;By linking together physically dispersed peers--whether people, groups,organizations, or countries--local interests can engage in global purposes.andM;Global businesses, for example, are becoming networked organizations to meetcompetitive pressures requiring ever-increasing speed, flexibility, andacces.andP;  Large-scale networks of small groups of people can acquire aworldwide geographic sensitivity, while at the same time being aware of andattentive to local differences.andM;Human resources, in particular, benefit in a globally networked organization.andO;By drawing on a broadly based resource pool, networks also have access to aricher and more diverse skill set than can be available to a collocatedgroup.andP;  Speed in getting new work started and speed in dissolution uponcompletion of a purpose are significantly enhanced by organizationalstructures that tap people's skills while largely leaving them physically inplace.andP;  This flexibility translates into more responsiveness and a shorter&quot;time to market.&quot;andM;Both the organization and the individual benefit from distributed work.andP;  Anetworked workforce is a happier and less stressed workforce.andP;  Becausenetworks greatly reduce the pressures for relocation, the costs in dollars,family stability, and community support are enormously relieved.andM;Natural networks--whether informal, voluntary, or business--are based oninteraction.andP;  Traditionally, interaction has been face-to-face.andP;  Thathistorical truth must be incorporated into the new realities of peopleinteracting through global technology networks.andP;  In networks, high tech andhigh touch come together.andP;  People are happier because distributed workrequires personal commitment to a project, and thus some alignment of teamgoals with individual goals.andM;Networks promote consensus.andP;  By encouraging participation--across geographic,functional, or other organizational boundaries--people are a part of groupplans and decisions.andP;  This enables members to effectively act locally toaccomplish the group's global purposes.andP;  People have increase potential forbroad exposure, visibility, and responsibility.andM;Work-at-a-distance is not only about doing better business.andP;  It is also abouthow we can collectively address the really big issues of our time.andP;  Peopleare, after all, naturally distributed around the planet and cannot, bydefinition, come together face-to-face in one place.andM;Only by learning how to do networked work can all parties affected by acomplex problem come together to solve it.andP;  And only by creating effectivenetworks to solve our collective problems can humanity avoid the alternativeof authoritarian control.andM;In combining our knowledge of face-to-face interaction with the newopportunities for global networks, we seek to make routine work-at-a-distanceat least as effective as collocated work.andP;  However, even now, distributedgroups may be smarter and more effective than collocated groups, depending onthe nature of the project.andP;  Any complex project, for example, benefits fromgood articulation of purpose and explicit planning.andP;  While these arecharacteristics that distributed teams must have just to survive, acollocated group may be more apt to just &quot;muddle through.&quot;andM;SMARTER GROUPS.andP;  Human evolution progresses by substituting brain for brawn.andM;We see the possibility of much smarter groups as new forms of human networksintegrate with the electronic world of technology networks.andP;  Remember!andP;  Onlya few generations of humans have had electronic (instantaneous)communications, and only now are we launching groups linked with thehistorically unique digital (cognitive) technology of computers.andM;Networks are the organizations of tomorrow at work today.andP;  They are growingin scope, developing new patters, and sprouting everywhere.andP;  This growth isdriven by cultural and technology changes, the millennia-scale shifts fromHunting-Gathering to Agriculture to Industry to the now-emerging InformationAge.andM;But we don't have to wait for tomorrow for smarter groups.andP;  Most people have,at some time, been a member of a group (family, community, work, volunteer)that really &quot;clicked.&quot;andP;  Most people intuitively know that high groupperformance with tremendous personal satisfaction is possible.andP;  Moreover,some people have even had that experience online.andP;  Some amazing groupexperiences have happened with people who have little or no face-to-facecontact, in digital places where space melts and time is instant.andM;The current effort to create groupware--software designed for the grouprather than individuals as the end user--is moving us closer every day to aquantum leap in group productivity.andP;  First, we need to develop computer-basedtools to enable productive and effective distributed work.andP;  Then we canextend those tools and, in doing so, enable smarter groups.andM;Only a little general improvement in people's ability to think and actcollectively will have a great impact on all issues and problems that areaddressed by groups.andP;  Networks are able to deal with the global problematiquethrough smarter groups as well as distributed work.andM;NETWORK SCIENCE.andP;  Networks are knowable.andP;  They may be grasped, studied, andstarted.andM;A common theory based on existing knowledge ties together our current visionsof personal participation, distributed work, and smarter groups.andP;  Moreexperience and accumulated knowledge will lead to tomorrow's network scienceand professional practice.andM;Network is a general concept, like system.andP;  Networks of molecules, neurons,waterways, transportation, radios, and computers share common features, suchas nodes and links.andP;  The network idea is especially applicable to the human,particularly social, context.andP;  As we learn more about both people andtechnology networks, and as we bring together specialized networkperspectives, we will find therein a potent set of fundamental networkprinciples to help guide us.andM;Networks can really be observed only &quot;in the field,&quot; yet they are often quiteintentionally created and have clearly measurable consequences, such asnetworks set up for business purposes.andP;  Thus, they are natural candidates foraction research.andP;  Learning while doing also means that, along with theprinciples, will come an array of tools, techniques, tested processes,categorized experience, trained professionals, and other forms of appliedknowledge.andM;We have taken some first steps toward a network science.andP;  There is atheoretical model and a structured approach to creating effective networks.andO;This is an iterative process of development with a broad scope, from teams toworldwide enterprises.andM;We now have network knowledge to use, test, and improve upon.andP;  Feeding backour accumulating experience, modifying our ideas and trying again, will giveus a constantly improving science every step of the way.andP;  Eventually,successful network organizations will lead to new management principles thatenhance all work and groups.andM;Networks are the organizations of tomorrow at work today.andM;Jessica Lipnack, president, and Jeffery Stamps, Ph.D., director of research,are cofounders of Networking Institute, Inc., a research and consultingcompany in West Newton, Massachusetts.andP;
