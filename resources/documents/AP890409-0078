The announcement scheduled for the Comdex trade show in Chicagocomes less than two weeks after Motorola gave some earlyinformation about its own new chip, the 68040.   Each chip will have 1 million or more electronic devices packedonto a fingernail of silicon, a density equivalent to two-laneroads blanketing all of California, Arizona and Nevada.   The race between Intel and Motorola is producing chips that areso advanced there will not be software that exploits their fullcapabilities for years.   ``It's a testament to human ingenuity that we can even makethese, even think of it,'' said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSIResearch Inc. in San Jose, Calif.   The leapfrogging has lifted the two U.S. companies far ahead ofany other competitors _ American, European or Japanese.   Each garnered about $475 million last year from sales of 32-bitchips, followed distantly by National Semiconductor Corp. with $50million, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp. ofScottsdale, Ariz.   All other companies combined sold $100 million worth, theresearch firm said.   A 32-bit chip handles instructions that contain information inchunks of 32 bits. A bit is a zero or a one, the smallest units ofinformation used in a computer.   Now there are signs that Intel is pulling ahead. Motorola usedto have a substantial lead in 32-bit chips because it sold most ofthe ones that were used in technical workstations and non-computerequipment, such as phone switches. Apple Computer Inc. also usesMotorola chips.   Intel's biggest market, meanwhile, has been IBM-compatiblepersonal computers ever since International Business Machines Corp.picked Intel's 8088 for its original PC in 1981.   The new Intel 80486 is the natural successor for PCs made by IBMas well as Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy Corp. and the rest. ButIntel, not satisfied, is staging an assault on Motorola'sworkstation market with the 80486 and the recently announced i860,another 32-bit processor.   ``Motorola has by far the most serious competition they've everhad for that technical workstation market,'' from Intel and a hostof smaller companies, said Michael Slater, editor and publisher ofMicroprocessor Report in Palo Alto, Calif.   Japanese companies make most of the simple microprocessors thatgo into consumer products such as videocassette recorders andmicrowave ovens. They also dominate the world market for memorychips, where manufacturing skill is the critical factor.   American companies, though, dominate in top-of-the-linemicroprocessors, which have all the computing power of themainframe computers of less than a decade ago. That's partlybecause they have customers locked into their designs.   It's also partly because Americans are still better at complexdesign work. Microprocessors require it, while memory chips don'tso much.   ``It's like the difference between writing a novel and writing adictionary. In a novel, everything has to work together and it hasto flow,'' Hutcheson said.   New microprocessors have come along so frequently that softwarewriters never even got a chance to develop programs that tookadvantage of the features of Intel's 80286, which came out in 1982.Instead, they jumped straight to writing for the 80386, which cameout in 1985.   Programs that use some 80386 features are just beginning toreach the market. Fortunately, the 80486 is similar enough that itwill be easy to upgrade programs to take advantage of its specialfeatures.   Volume production of the 80486 is expected to begin in early1990, and personal computers built around it will be out at thesame time.   For users, the new computers will mean colorful, life-likegraphics, more user-friendliness, faster calculations and theability to do several tasks at once, such as writing a memo whilein the background the machine is recalculating a spreadsheet andprinting out a graph on a laser printer.   The software to do all that is taking time, but ``the momentumis absolutely there,'' said Michael Swavely, vice president formarketing at Compaq.   The immense power of the new chips is turning engineers,lawyers, accountants and others into do-it-yourselfers when itcomes to processing information. That is changing the nature ofbusiness.   ``You can say one thing for sure, you'll never be chained to theMIS (mainframe computer) department again, waiting for them tograce you with the report you need,'' said Mel Phelps, an analystat Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. in San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
