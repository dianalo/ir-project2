When scandals rocked Bofors, all of Swedentrembled.   Bofors has become synonymous with corruption in the murky worldof the international arms trade. Its questioned dealings with PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi helped bring him down in India's recentelections.   A trial of three former Bofors executives has exposed evidenceof foul play in the corridors of power. The corruption charges havedeflated the faith many Swedes had in the honesty of theirleadership.   Two affairs concerning Bofors were uncovered in the last fiveyears:   _Bofors was accused of paying up to $50 million in bribes tosecure a 1986 contract to sell $1.4 billion in artillery guns toIndia.   _Bofors executives were tried on charges of violating exportrestrictions in 1979-81 to sell advanced surface-to-air missiles toMiddle East countries by using Singapore as an intermediary. Theverdict is due Dec. 22.   Other arms manufacturers have been implicated in other cases ofalleged unauthorized sales.   Bofors spokesman Borje Johanson, a former army lieutenantcolonel, said Bofors now is ``playing strictly by the book'' andconcentrating on ``delivering good products and fullfillingcontracts.'' Unethical deals ``will not exist,'' he said.   AB Bofors does not see itself as just another Swedish company.In the entrance to the company's elegant headquarters hangs aportrait of Alfred Nobel, the benefactor of the Nobel prizes whoonce owned Bofors.   Bofors is Sweden's largest weapons manufacturer and belongs tothe Nobel Industries Group, one of the powerhouses of Swedishindustry. Though privately owned, Bofors operates almost like agovernment company.   Production is tuned to the needs of the Swedish military andexports are severly restricted according to regulations forbiddingsales to countries in conflict or in volatile regions.   This country of only 8.4 million people produces supersonicwarplanes, submarines, and surface battle ships. Bofors alone makesa range of artillery, missiles, air defense systems and explosives.   Sweden says it needs an independent arms industry and strongdefense to give teeth to its neutrality and avoid entanglementswith any military alliance.   Each foreign sale must be approved by the War MaterialsInspection Board, a government agency, under a strict set of rules.   At their 10-week trial, the former Bofors directors admittedskirting the export restrictions by selling the equipment toSingapore. But they claimed they were innocent of criminal activitybecause the government tacitly approved the sales.   One of the defense attorneys, Goran Ekdahl, said a system oftacit agreements had been practiced for 20 years because thegovernment wanted to avoid an open debate about where its weaponrywas being used.   Government officials and former ministers denied knowing theweapons were being sold to blacklisted countries. But testimony anddocuments showed that the security police and at least someofficials were informed and took no action to stop the sales.   In 1987, when the affairs were being scrutinized, the head ofthe War Material Inspection Board, Carl Algernon, fell in front ofa subway train, in what police ruled was an apparent suicide.   Gunnar Adler-Karlsson, an economics professor, author and socialcritic, said he believed top government officials were lying in theBofors case.   ``I cannot prove it, but it is absolutely clear as far as I amconcerned, that all ministers of trade and war material inspectorsunderstood that what was officially going to Singapore, absolutelywould not stay in Singapore,'' Adler-Karlsson said.   Bofors' image problems were compounded by its handling of thebribery accusations in the Indian howitzer contract.   Bofors denied the allegations but rejected demands from Indianopposition leaders to open its books. Gandhi also denied that anyIndian had received kickbacks or commissions. But he resigned lastweek after his Congress Party failed to win a majority in nationalelections that focused on charges of corruption and ineptitude.   Bofors officials said they were intent on riding out the storm,because it was a matter of company ethics not to reveal classifedparts of a business contract.   ``We cannot contradict the wish of the customer, or thecontracts we have signed, and go out and reveal the content ofvarious agreements,'' said Johanson, the company spokesman.   ``If we did, it would mean that in the long run, we and Swedencouldn't sign agreements and be trusted that this is an issuebetween buyer and seller,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday AMs Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
