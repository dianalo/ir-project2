Cmdr. Kendall Pease, spokesman for the U.S. On-Site InspectionAgency set up under the treaty, said the Soviets notified U.S.officials early today they would visit facilities at CapeCanaveral, Fla.; Lawton, Okla.; and Middle River, Md.   Three teams of 10 Soviet inspectors were expected to leave theWashington area at midmorning for inspections of up to 24 hoursthat could be extended by an additional eight hours if both sidesagree, Pease said.   The Soviets were to notify the Pentagon later today of a fourthinspection site. The Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Ala., was theonly other site available under the treaty, Pease said.   Pease said the inspection teams, which arrived in Washington onMonday, are expected to return to Washington on Thursday.   In Maryland, the inspectors planned to visit a Martin Mariettaplant just outside Baltimore where missile launchers once wereproduced. In Florida, they were to visit a former Army and AirForce missile testing facility. In Oklahoma, the destination was anArmy base where missiles are housed.   The Soviets completed two rounds of inspections at U.S.facilities earlier this year.   The inspections are called for under the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty, signed by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev at the Washington summit in December. Thetreaty calls for the elimination of all intermediate-range missileswithin three years.</TEXT></DOC>
