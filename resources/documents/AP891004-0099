The feud has claimed at least 15 lives so far this month, andmonitoring groups say more than 95 people were killed last month,when negotiations between leaders of militant anti-apartheid groupsand the more conservative Zulu political organization Inkathareached an impasse.   The anti-apartheid alliance, in a statement today, suggestedthat Inkatha leader Mangotuthu Buthelezi has misused the peaceprocess to seek political gain. The alliance also accused police ofbias against its followers.   More than 2,000 blacks have been killed since factional fightingbegan on a sustained basis in late 1986.   The current peace initiative started in June, and the monthlydeath toll dropped by more than half, to about 40, as both sidesissued positive statements. But Inkatha last month suspended itsparticipation in the talks because it felt the other side remainedhostile.   Opposing Inkatha are supporters of the United Democratic Front,a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. Bothgroups favor militant anti-government protest actions and endorsethe political views of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement.   Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, rejects the ANC's useof violence and opposes hard-line protest strategies such asboycotts, general strikes and economic sanctions.   At a news conference, leaders of the United Democratic Front andthe labor federation suggested Buthelezi was more interested inenhancing his political position than in achieving peace.   ``A peace process must be initiated with or without Inkatha,''the two organizations said. ``We cannot resolve the violence bycontinually stressing our differences and by attempting topolitically embarrass each other.''   In preliminary talks, negotiators proposed a formal peaceconference involving 10-member delegations from Inkatha, the ANC,the United Democratic Fron and the trade union congress.   However, Inkatha's leadership declared last month that thereshould only be two 10-member delegations, its own and onerepresenting all the other groups. Inkatha also said it wants apersonal reply from the ANC in response to a letter Buthelezi sentregarding arrangements for the talks.   The unrest report issued today by police headquarters said sixmen and a woman were killed overnight in four separate incidents inMpumalanga and Taylor's Halt in central Natal. Following standardpolice practice, no details were given about the affiliations ofthose involved.   A clash involving roughly 800 men was reported in Mpumalanga onMonday, and several houses in the area have been burned down byattackers.   Also today, an opposition political leader challenged thePretoria city council to follow the example of Johannesburg, CapeTown and other cities by ending segregation of public facilities.   Tertius Spies, the regional leader of the anti-apartheidDemocratic Party, said municipal buses, libraries, parks andswimming pools were off-limits to blacks in the nation's capital,despite claims by the governing National Party that apartheid wasdead. The National Party controls Pretoria's city council, whichSpies said was ``dragging its heels.''</TEXT></DOC>
