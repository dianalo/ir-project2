He would not elaborate.   Haber would not say where or when the meetings had taken place.   The daily Haaretz reported that the defense minister recentlymet with an author of the Palestinian National Charter, a platformof the Palestine Liberation Organization. The report did not namethe Palestinian or give the date of the meeting.   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidRabin decided against publishing the names of the Palestinianleaders who met him, fearing they could be assassinated.   The decision followed the June 7 stabbing and wounding of theIsraeli-appointed mayor of the West Bank town of El Bireh, HassanTawil.   In a related development, Shaike Erez, a military governor forthe West Bank, met more than 30 Arab merchants in the city ofRamallah to discuss ``ways of improving commerce'' followingrepeated strikes in the Arab uprising, said Olivier Rafowicz, aspokesman for the military government in the West Bank.   Rafowicz described the talks as ``very good'' but refused toelaborate.   News of Rabin's meetings with local leaders in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip followed a weekend of violence in theterritories that Israel captured in the 1967 war.   At least 210 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killedsince the uprising began Dec. 8.   In the West Bank, army troops Sunday shot and wounded a20-year-old Palestinian during disturbances in the village of Salemnear Nablus, a military spokesman said.   The spokesman said Arab residents attacked a routine army patrol``with rocks, slingshots and road blockades.'' An official at theIttihad hospital in Nablus said the man was hit in the left side ofthe neck but was in fair condition.   The army closed two schools in the West Bank and one in the GazaStrip on Sunday after student protests erupted, the militarygovernment spokesmen said. The schools closed in the West Bank werein Tubas and El Khader. A school in the Ein el Sultan refugee campnear Jericho was closed last week.   Rafowicz said they would be closed ``several days.''   The refugee camp school in Ein el Sultan is run by the UnitedNations Relief and Works Agency. In the camp, an 18-year-old wasshot to death by a civilian bus driver last week after young menthrew stones at the bus.   Israel radio reported that the Tubas school was closed afterstudents came to school Sunday morning but refused to attendclasses and stood outside the building. Classes are normally heldSunday.   Soldiers also shut a U.N.-operated junior high school for girlsin the Gaza town of Bani Suheila following anti-Israelidemonstrations on Saturday and several previous occasions, said aspokesman for the Gaza military government. He said the schoolwould remain closed until the school year ends at the end of June.   Arab schools in the West Bank and east Jerusalem were closed forabout four months by authorities who said they were staging groundsfor disturbances in the uprising.   The schools reopened in late May and early June.   Also Sunday, government leaders issued an appeal for Israelis tohelp battle hundreds of fires that are being blamed on Arabarsonists.   Cabinet ministers at their weekly meeting appealed to Israelisto ``help all bodies that deal with extinguishing and preventingfires.'' Thousands of blazes have broken out since early May andhave destroyed more than 25,000 acres of trees and pasture land, agovernment statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
