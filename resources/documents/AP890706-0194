JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursdayordered a ban on most remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos,forbidding its use in hundreds of products from automobile brakeparts to water pipes.   The prohibition will be phased in over the next seven years andapply only to new products. Asbestos-containing products already inuse _ and not affected by previous restrictions _ are not includedbecause in some cases replacement might be more hazardous than agradual phase-out, officials said.   The action, however, will end the use of asbestos by 1996 in allbut a handful of commercial products _ guided missile liners,acetylene cylinders and some sealing tapes, for example _ for whichno adequate substitute has been found and where concerns abouthealth risks are minimal, the agency said.   In the final phase of the ban, beginning in 1996, an estimated 94percent of uses of asbestos will be prohibited, said the agency.   ``We're eliminating a known cancer-causing substance from themarketplace,'' declared EPA Administrator William Reilly at a newsconference. He said that despite the known cancer threat fromasbestos the mineral continues to be widely used.   The EPA action does not affect continuing efforts to ridbuildings, including schools, of loosely formed asbestos insulationand spray-on asbestos, both of which have been banned fromproduction since 1978. The EPA reiterated that removal of suchasbestos should be carefully controlled to prevent even more seriousexposure from airborne particles.   Under the new regulation, the use of asbestos in some products,including roofing material, pipe wrap and sheet products will bebanned next year; its use by automakers in brake pads and liningswill be prohibited beginning in 1993, and its use in autoreplacement parts, cement water distribution pipes, roof shinglesand a variety of other uses will be ended in 1996.   Reilly said the timetable reflected the availability ofsubstitute products, some of which will be more expensive.   The EPA estimated that the cost to consumers of the shift fromasbestos products to substitutes will be about $460 million over thenext 13 years. During the same time, the shift is expected to resultin a saving of at least 200 cancer deaths, the agency estimated.   Asbestos over the years has had widespread industrial uses withan estimated 30 million tons of the mineral used in this countrysince the turn of the century, most of it since World War II. It hasseemed ideal for insulation and friction-product uses because of itsstrength and resistance to heat.   But microscopic asbestos fibers can remain in the body fordecades and have been blamed for a variety of illnesses includinglung cancer; mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the chest andabdominal membranes; and asbestosis, a chronic disease of the lungsthat makes breathing progressively more difficult.   Reilly said the EPA _ which first listed asbestos as a hazardousair pollutant in 1972 and urged its ban in 1979 _ has taken too longto remove asbestos products from the marketplace.   ``The first question I had was why has this thing been around solong,'' said Reilly, who was appointed this year.   Critics have accused the Reagan administration of blockingearlier EPA acton. In the mid-1980s, a congressional investigationconcluded that the Office of Management and Budget held up proposalof a regulation for more than a year. That regulation was finallyproposed in 1986, but no final action was taken until Thursday.   In recent years asbestos use has declined sharply because ofconcern about its health effects. There were 85,000 metric tons ofasbestos used for a variety of products in 1987, compared to 240,000metric tons three years earlier.   Two of the most widespread and continuing uses of asbestos is inthe manufacturer of brake pads and linings for automobiles andtrucks. Although automakers have been phasing out the use ofasbestos, most new cars continue to have some asbestos brakeproducts.   Asbestos also is part of the nation's water system. There aremore than 400,000 miles of concrete-asbestos pipe carrying drinkingwater to thousands of communities. The EPA said that while there isconcern about health risks in the production and replacement of suchpipes, there is no risk of contamination of drinking water.   Reilly urged against consumers attempting to dig upasbestos-cement water pipes or to replace asbestos brake parts.   ``Disturbing asbestos brakes, shingles, or siding already inplace where there is no health or safety reason to do so can cause amuch greater health hazard than leaving them in place,'' said Reilly.   The expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalists,   ``This is a new approach _ pollution prevention,'' saidJacqueline Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil.   Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist with the Environmental DefenseFund, called the action ``long past due'' and a ``landmarkdevelopment in protecting environmental quality and public health.''   However, the Asbestos Information Association said that productsnow being marketed with asbestos are manufactured, installed andused safely.   ``Current asbestos products bind the asbestos fibers in locked-inor encapsulated matrices that significantly diminish fiberrelease,'' the group said.</TEXT></DOC>
