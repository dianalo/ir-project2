Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think that meanswe're going to have some very difficult economic times in thefuture. I hope I'm wrong.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized Hatch's argumentsand called the planned increase from $3.35 to $4.25 by April 1991``a very small adjustment'' that will leave minimum-wage earnerswell behind inflation since the last increase in 1981.   ``We have really, I think, failed in our compact with thoseAmericans who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder,''Kennedy said.   ``Never in the half century of the minimum wage has this long aperiod elapsed without an increase and may we do everything in ourpower to make sure that the working poor never have to wait thatlong again.''   The House-passed proposal, which also would create a subminimum``training wage'' for teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck aweek ago between President Bush and Congress' majority Democrats.   Kennedy and Hatch were the only senators to speak on the issueMonday, and whether a final vote will come Tuesday appeared tohinge on whether Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on aplan to raise the government's debt ceiling.   Several Republicans are mulling amendments that could delay afinal vote on the minimum-wage bill indefinitely but an agreementon the debt limit likely would lead to an agreement on a timetablefor debate on the wage bill as well.   House and Senate leaders were meeting Monday night to discussthe debt limit.   The minimum-wage bill provides two 45-cent increases, one April1 and the other a year later. It also allows employers to pay alower wage to workers ages 16 to 19 with fewer than three monthstotal job experience.   The subminimum could be paid for three additional months if theworkers were in certified training programs. The subminimum wouldbe $3.35 beginning April 1 and rise to $3.61 April 1, 1991.   The provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
