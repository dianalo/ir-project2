The survey sponsored by the banking consulting firm AlexSheshunoff andamp; Co. also found a widespread belief that the nation'sthrift crisis will raise personal income taxes and push more banksand Sandamp;Ls into foreign ownership.   Only 67 percent of the people surveyed last week said theytrusted what financial institutions said about their safety andsoundness. A similar survey in March found 84 percent believed whatthe institutions told them.   During the same period, the level of respondents who believedwhat the government told them about the safety of financialinstitutions fell to 39 percent from 48 percent.   ``Even Federal Deposit Insurance is questioned; 28 percent polledworry about losing money in a financial institution even though itis insured,''said Sheshunoff. That compared with 18 percent in theMarch survey.   The survey was conducted last week in random telephone interviewswith 308 people nationwide and 308 in Texas, California and NewYork. The maximum sampling error was plus or minus 5.6 percent.   Among other survey results:   _59 percent of the respondents believed troubled thrifts shouldbe shut down.   _70 percent blamed bad judgment, not fraud, for the thriftindustry's problems. However, 77 percent said the government has notbeen tough enough in its prosecution.   _84 percent said banks and thrifts should be regulated in thesame way.   _47 percent said they knew of the Bush Administration's plan,currently being debated in Congress, to bail out the thriftindustry. However, 48 percent of those who knew about the plan saidthey didn't think the plan would solve the industry's problems.   _78 percent of the respondents said the thrift crisis wouldresult in foreigners buying more banks and Sandamp;Ls, 73 percent said itwould raise personal income taxes, 62 percent said it would limitbusiness growth and 47 percent said it would cause their home todecline in value.   _8 percent named the thrift crisis as the nation's most importantproblem, with the federal deficit topping the list at 42 percent,followed by the trade deficit and congressional ethics problems.   Although much of the thrift industry's problems have been in thesouthwest and Texas, slightly fewer Texans worry about losing moneythan the national average: 28 percent nationally compared with 26percent in Texas.   ``Texans have had more experience with financial institutionsthat have been closed,'' Sheshunoff said. ``This personal experiencemay have shown them that they won't lose their money.''   But at the same time, 13 percent of Texans have withdrawn moneyfrom banks or thrifts due to the problems in financial institutions,compared with 11 percent elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
