(products).andO;Product:   Switch-It 3.11 (Utility program).andO;Topic:     Utility ProgramsMultitaskingEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Better Software Technology Inc.andM;SWITCH-IT 3.11andM;Switch-It was the fastest in PC Week's task-switching test, taking only 5seconds to change from 1-2-3 to WordPerfect using the hard-disk swap area.andO;The $99.95 program also supports the largest number of partitions of thegroup: 100.andM;Switch-It can pack these features into a compact 27K bytes of memory because,unlike the other products, it does not automatically load a partial secondcopy of COMMAND.COM in every partition.andP;  This feature saved 3.4K bytes ofmemory in PC Week's tests with DOS 3.30.andM;Unfortunately, this approach also caused the only incompatibility PC Weekencountered: Manifest would not run when loaded directly into a Switch-Itpartition.andP;  To make Manifest work, a user must load COMMAND.COM first.andM;PC Week encountered no other problems with Switch-It.andP;  The program managesits swap area well, using expanded memory or disk space only as needed,rather than preallocating the maximum possible swap space.andP;  Switch-It can useboth expanded memory and disk space, moving to disk only after it hasconsumed all the available expanded memory.andM;Switch-It cannot, however, swap applications directly to extended memory.andO;The user must define a virtual disk in extended memory, then swap to thatvirtual disk.andM;Switch-It's installation procedure is simple and easy to use, with pop-upmenus for defining partitions and selecting other features.andP;  The installationprogram will even search the hard disk for applications listed in itsSTARTUP.DAT file, then automatically add those applications as choices on itspartition menu.andM;Switch-It also lets users move data among partitions by way of a clipboard.andM;Switch-It's documentation, however, was the worst of the products reviewed.andO;The 45-page manual has no index or tutorial, and does not provide enoughexamples for novices.andP;  A limited on-line help facility augments the manual.andM;An upgrade to the program is now in beta test and is due for release in May.andM;Better Software Technology Inc. can be reached in Framingham, Mass., at (508)879-0744.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;Before I ran into this tool, I had to keep a log of the various directoriesinto which I had put programs.andP;  Now, all I have to do is key in the number[of the application] or use the arrow or Page-Down key,&quot; said Larry Carter,research engineer in the science and technology department of BellSouthServices Inc., an Atlanta-based service organization for regional telephonecompanies.andM;&quot;It's so easy that my 6-year-old niece can use it,&quot; said Carter, who has theproduct installed on several PCs at home and at work.andM;Carter runs Switch-It on IBM PC ATs to help keep track of research and tohelp run applications, such as Lotus' 1-2-3; Symantec Corp.'s Qandamp;A and TimeLine; Digitalk Inc.'s Smalltalk/V; and Borland's Paradox, Turbo C and TurboAssembler.andM;One of his Switch-It partitions contains a program that sets up a SunMicrosystems network and enables Carter to go to a menu and connect to thenetwork.andM;With 5M bytes of Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded-Memory Specification (LIMEMS) memory, switching among partitions is very fast, said Carter.andP;  Even whenthe program has to swap to a hard disk, he said, response time is still good-- between three and five seconds.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
