After 18 hours of meetings with top Chinese officialsduring his 54-hour visit, Mr. Baker indicated Sunday eveningthat China had offered several proposals that could check thedownward spiral of U.S.-China relations.</LP><TEXT>   These included: increased protection of intellectualproperty rights; a pledge to sign the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty by April; a willingness to abide byan international convention that limits the export of longrange missiles and missile technology; and a commitment toopen additional air routes between the U.S. and China,including an all-cargo flight.   Mr. Baker said that although he spent most of his timediscussing human rights, he could report little headway otherthan obtaining an accounting of the whereabouts of some 800people who were on a list of political prisoners that theU.S. had presented China in June.   &quot;I didn't come here expecting a dramatic breakthrough,&quot;Mr. Baker said regarding human rights. &quot;The gulf is too wideto expect that.&quot;   Indeed, an example of the human rights problems aroseduring Mr. Baker's visit. On Saturday, Dai Qing, once China'sbestknown female journalist who was jailed for a yearfollowing the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre, was takenaway by public security officials, according to friends andfamily. She was picked up after being contacted by the U.S.Embassy about the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Baker.Ms. Dai was awarded a journalism fellowship at HarvardUniversity this year, but Chinese authorities wouldn't allowher to go. As Mr. Baker departed for Washington, Ms. Dai wasstill missing.   Mr. Baker said he found the news &quot;distressing&quot; anddirected U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy to investigate.   Many of the signs of progress announced by Mr. Baker wereadjustments to previous undertakings between Beijing andWashington. For example, Mr. Baker said that the governmenthas now &quot;agreed in principle&quot; to sign a memorandum ofunderstanding banning China from exporting prison-madeproducts to the U.S. Such an agreement has been underdiscussion for several months, and China has long maintainedit is acceptable because current Chinese law bans suchexports.   Similarly, China assured Mr. Baker that by year's end itsNational People's Congress would ratify the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty and that within three months afterthat China would officially sign the document. China, theonly acknowledged nuclear power not a signatory, has beenassuring the U.S. and Japan since June that it would sign thetreaty.   The most significant sign of progress on weapons controlcame with Mr. Baker's announcement that China said it is nowwilling to follow the Missile Technology Control Regime, aset of guidelines that prohibit the export of long-rangemissiles and technology involved in such missiles.   But Mr. Baker said that China's cooperation was contingenton President Bush canceling sanctions he announced in May inresponse to reports that China was selling such missiles toPakistan and Syria. Those sanctions block the shipment ofsupercomputers and satellites to China and ban the export ofmilitarily sensitive equipment to two government-ownedChinese companies involved in missile production and sales.   Mr. Baker said that he considered the package of promisesoffered by China to be &quot;proof of China's commitment to theimprovement of relations between our two countries.&quot; China'sstate news agency said the talks displayed &quot;progress on someissues of common concern.&quot;   Mr. Baker's announcement came after a tense weekend inwhich U.S.-China relations increasingly resembled a badmarriage in which communication is severely strained butneither side can contemplate divorce.   Despite their deep ideological divide, the U.S. and Chinahave become reliant on each other. Because China is apermanent member of the United Nations Security Council andmajor power in Asia, the U.S. needs China's cooperation onmany global issues. China's economy has become reliant on theU.S. market, which now absorbs one-third of the country'sexports.   During his visit, which consisted more of working dinnerswith government ministers than ritual banquets with theleadership, Mr. Baker warned that his visit presented bothrisks and opportunities. The risk was that if China doesn'trespond with constructive measures, President Bush's policyof engagement could be altered by an increasingly restiveCongress. The opportunity is that simply by coming to China,and thereby ending a 2 1/2-year U.S. ban on high levelcontacts with China, Mr. Baker has provided an opening forChina to carry out policy changes in line with pledges madein previous negotiations among lower officials.   Chinese and U.S. officials who attended the meetings saidMr. Baker and his Chinese hosts spent much of the weekendtalking past each other. A U.S. official said Mr. Bakercontinually stressed that human rights is the &quot;cornerstone&quot;of U.S. foreign policy and that he brought up the &quot;TiananmenSquare tragedy&quot; several times at almost every meeting.   For their part, Chinese officials repeated themes they'veemployed since the 1989 massacre of demonstrators in Beijing.They stressed that China is concentrating on economicdevelopment and that China's concept of human rights isdifferent than that of the West.   China indicated to Mr. Baker that it would like tosideline U.S. human rights complaints and try to move aheadon other issues. Chinese President Yang Shangkun referred tothis strategy as &quot;seeking common ground while reservingdifferences.&quot;   The real success or failure of the weekend's discussionwill be determined by whether China takes concrete actions inline with commitments made to Mr. Baker on Sunday. The firstsignal of this may come later this week when U.S. and Chinesenegotiators gather in Washington to discuss copyrights andpatents.   Those talks, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, face aNov. 26 deadline that could trigger retaliatory tariffsagainst Chinese exports to the U.S. Although he offered nodetails, Mr. Baker said that China had made &quot;positiveintellectual property rights proposals&quot; during the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
