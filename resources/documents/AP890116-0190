(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evidence that cultivated vegetablesfound in a cave are half as old as was believed is forcingarchaeologists to examine their assumptions about how agriculturewas introduced in the Southwest.   Indians were once thought to have cultivated corn at Bat Cave,along the southern rim of the Plains of San Augustin in southwestNew Mexico, thousands of years before the agricultural lifestylecaught on throughout the region.   Bat Cave was excavated in 1948 and 1950. In an early applicationof radiocarbon dating, researchers concluded that corn cobs found atthe cave had been grown 6,000 years ago. The findings influenced ageneration's ideas about early agriculture, said University of NewMexico anthropologist W.H. Wills.   A new excavation in 1981 and 1983, and re-examination of theearlier artifacts using updated radiocarbon techniques showed thecorn, bean and squash specimens from the site are 3,000 to 3,500years old.   Those dates correspond to the age of domesticated plants in othersites in the Southwest, said Wills, who supervised the re-excavation.   Based on the early findings, researchers speculated thatagriculture spread slowly because crops initially were a dietarysupplement with limited value.   The newer findings and data from other agricultural sites in theMogollon Highlands suggest that people must have considered corn,beans and squash to be very important for their survival, Willssaid. Cultivation of crops demanded a dramatic change in lifestylefor those people.   Because people throughout the region all seemed to adoptagriculture at about the same time, something might have happened tothe environment to make the change worthwhile, or necessary, he said.   Hunter-gatherers ranged over the Southwest and northern Mexico,traveling hundreds of miles a year in small bands. Cultivating cropsat high elevations would have required at least some to remain inone place for a growing season.   ``We tend to think of agriculture as inherently better thanrunning around as hunter-gatherers,'' but early plants werenutritionally deficient and farms faced the risk of poor weather orblight, Wills said.   Corn, squash and beans, the staples of Southwestern agriculture,were first domesticated in the Valley of Mexico.</TEXT><NOTE>University Soaring in High-Altitude Balloon Research</NOTE><DATELINE>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Things are up in the air at New MexicoState University, and that's the way they like it.   The Physical Science Laboratory has nearly cornered the market inhigh-altitude balloon research since winning a $45 million NationalAeronautics and Space Administration contract in October 1987, saiddirector Harold Connell. ``It's the only large balloon program inthe country,'' he said.   The laboratory has launched more than 50 giant helium-filledballoons that carry scientific payloads weighing up to 6,000 poundsas high as 130,000 feet _ nearly 27 miles.   Most are released from the National Scientific Balloon Facilityin Palestine, Texas. The site is used when upper-altitude winds arefrom the east, to avoid landings in heavily populated areas. Whenthe upper winds are from the west, a launch area in Fort Sumner isused. A series of balloons also launched from Australia andAntarctica to study last summer's supernova, which was observableonly in the Southern Hemisphere.   ``The balloons that we fly regularly at Palestine (hold) between11 million and 29 million cubic feet of helium,'' Connell said.``The large ones have 15 acres of plastic in them about as thick asa dry-cleaning garment bag. That 15 acres of plastic will weighabout 4,000 pounds by itself.''</TEXT><NOTE>Turkish Beetle May Be Hero in War on Russian Wheat Aphid</NOTE><DATELINE>PALISADE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tiny beetle from Turkey may be the heroof Colorado's war against the Russian wheat aphid, which costgrowers an estimated $26 million last year in damage and controls.   Some winter wheat fields in Moffat County suffered as much as 25percent infestation by the aphid last fall, said Bob Hammond, anentomologist with the state Department of Agriculture Insectaryhere. If this winter is mild, the aphids will survive to cause moreproblems next spring, he said.   But the Scynmus frontalis beetle, which looks like its cousin,the ladybird beetle but is one-fourth the size, may save the day.   The Scynmus, imported by the U.S. Department of AgricultureBeneficial Insects Laboratory, kills more Russian wheat aphids thanit can eat. It kills an aphid, briefly feeds, then goes for a freshkill. It can rapidly clean out an aphid infestation where itsslower-eating cousin takes much more time.   The insectary soon will be raising the Scynmus, Hammond said,though it will take some time to begin mass production because ofspace limitations. A new technique will have to be established tofit the facility's size.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 19</NOTE></DOC>
