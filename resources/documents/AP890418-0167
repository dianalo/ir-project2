U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond, who is presiding over the6-year-old case, scheduled a June 13 hearing to consider approvingthe settlement.   Under terms agreed to March 24, the American subsidiary of theGerman auto company would pay $670,000, and the union would pay$48,000, said Tom McDonald, VW spokesman in Troy, Mich.   The defendants settled to avoid the costs of further litigation.   ``It's also our intention to make sure that the reputation ofVolkswagen remains as high as it was when we were making cars inWestmoreland County,'' McDonald said. The company referrred to theplant, which has subsequently been closed, as VW-Westmoreland.   ``This is not an admission of guilt on VW's part or the UAW'spart,'' said McDonald.   Volkswagen also agreed to pay $250,000 in lawyers' fees.   The class-action lawsuit was filed in 1983 by black workers whoclaimed they were victims of harassment and racially motivatedfirings by company management and that the union failed to provideprotection.   Volkswagen closed its lone U.S. assembly plant last year, citingdeclining sales of its Golf and Jetta models.   About 800 blacks could share the money if they accept thesettlement terms. Individual payments would range from $70,000 to asupervisor who said he was harassed on the job to $200 for hourlyworkers who were fired before their 90-day probations expired.   The plaintiffs had sought $70 million.</TEXT></DOC>
