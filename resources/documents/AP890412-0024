The Senate aviation subcommittee examined the problem of agingairliners at a hearing on Tuesday, a session that also produced awarning from the panel's chairman that tougher governmentregulations might be on the way.   The chairman, Wendell Ford, D-Ky., told reporters after thesession that Congress should consider requiring the FAA to force anincrease in the frequency of inspections of older aircraft, requirereplacing certain parts rather than examinations of them, and settraining and experience standards for airline inspectors andmechanics.   Ever since the roof of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737peeled off over Hawaii last April, sweeping a flight attendant toher death, attention has been focused on the older aircraft.   The FAA and the nation's major airlines agreed in February tomore than $800 million worth of improvements to be made on 1,300older Boeing jetliners. The goal is to eliminate certain routineinspections in favor of design improvements and a schedule forregular replacements of certain parts.   On Tuesday, Anthony J. Broderick, the FAA's associateadministrator for regulation, said that late this month or in earlyMay, the agency will propose rules that would require more than 160structural changes in Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s.   The last year has been a difficult one for the older members ofthe U.S. airline fleet. Nine people died in December when a19-year-old United Airlines Boeing 747 broke open over Hawaii; a22-year-old Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 landed without casualtiesafter a hole opened in its fuselage while flying over WestVirginia; and an 8-year-old Piedmont Airlines 727 lost an engineduring takeoff from Chicago.   The average age of airliners used by U.S. carriers is 12.7years, up from 8 years in 1980. It is expected to be 15 years bythe year 2000, because there are backlogs of orders for newaircraft and an ever-growing passenger load.   At the hearing, officials from the FAA, the airlines and theaircraft manufacturing industry assured lawmakers that improvementswere being made constantly in how aircraft are constructed,maintained, tested and inspected.   But Benjamin A. Cosgrove, a vice president for engineering forBoeing Commercial Airplanes, a Boeing subsidiary, said FAAinspectors should spend more time examining airlines and less timechecking paperwork, and complained that FAA fines for maintenanceinfractions can be counterproductive.   ``Routine use of such penalties tends to drive problemsunderground and communication in the industry suffers,'' Cosgrovesaid.   Clyde Kizer, engineering vice president for the Air TransportAssociation, which represents the major airlines, said the group isconsidering whether inspectors and mechanics for all carriersshould be required to meet uniform training standards.   This angered Ford, who asked: ``Why should there be any questionbut that you should go ahead with strict training and educationacross-the-board?''</TEXT></DOC>
