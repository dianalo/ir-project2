<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0438 </DOCNO><TEXT>The suppression of macroscopic oscillations (so-called 'sawteeth') ofthe central region of a magnetically confined plasma column is relatedto the effect of magnetically trapped energetic nuclei produced by theinjection of rf waves or neutral beams. We evaluate the threshold for,and describe the process involved in, the transition of m/sup 0/=1 modes,which trigger the crash phase of sawtooth oscillations, to a regime thatis shown to be stable.</TEXT></DOC>
