Under theseconditions Mo(6) is shown to completely reduce to Mo(4) which entersLiRMo/sub 3/O/sub 8/, R/sub 2/MoO/sub 5/ and Li/sub 2/Mo/sub 2/O/sub5/ compounds. LiRMo/sub 3/O/sub 8/ crystallizing in hexagonal latticesis described. Values of elementary cell parameters and IR spectroscopydata are given. LiYMo/sub 3/O/sub 8/ behaviour in the air is studied.</TEXT></DOC>
