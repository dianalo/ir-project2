West of the battle in Jbaa, Israeli warplanes bombed aPalestinian base it said was used for planning a staging terroristattacks.   Thursday marked the fifth straight day of fighting in the latestbattle between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God.   Police said Amal lost five combatants in an aborted attack tocapture the mountain village of Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of Sidon.   A police spokesman said seven Amal militiamen also were injuredin the attempt to storm Hezbollah positions.   A police spokesman said there was no report on Hezbollah'spossible casualties in Jbaa, the key to a triangular-shaped enclaveon the western edge of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' insouth Lebanon. About 500 Hezbollah fighters held the spot.   The new casualties brought the overall toll to 112 killed and 227wounded in the fighting since Sunday.   Four Israeli warplanes, meanwhile, attacked a base of PalestinianAbu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction in the Majdalyounvalley before dawn.   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line withpolice rules, said two of the jets fired four rockets into the base,located about four miles east of Sidon.   Ambulances evacuated the wounded, but a casualty count was notavailable.   The Fatah Revolutionary Council is ``clever in hiding theirlosses. It is very difficult to estimate their casualties,'' thepolice spokesman said.   Smoke billowed from the base, which Israeli warplanes also bombedWednesday night along with another council stronghold in the nearbyvillage of Bkusta in Israel's first air attack into Lebanon thisyear.   Israel said its jets returned safely.   The battle between the Shiite factions is the fourth majorconfrontation since April for control of Lebanon's 1 millionShiites, the nation's largest sect.   By police count, 388 people were killed and 1,209 wounded in theprevious three rounds of fighting.   Hezbollah seeks to create an Islamic republic in Lebanonpatterned after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran.   The more secular Amal rejects Iran's spiritual influence overLebanon's Shiites and favors a multi-sect government with Moslemssharing power equally with Christians.   Amal called a general strike for Friday in predominantly Shiiteareas of Lebanon to protest what it called ``Hezbollah's newNazism.''   Amal was referring to atrocities committed by Hezbollah fightersin an attack against Jbaa and four other villages in the regionSunday.   Police said both groups have committed ``horrific atrocities'' intheir current confrontation. Victims from both factions have beenfound with their heads chopped off or their bodies otherwise maimed.   The police spokesman said the vanguard of a 1,000-strong Amalforce attacking from the west, southwest and south reached Jbaaearly in the day Thursday, ``but was pushed back by Hezbollahis infierce fighting.''   Amal pulled its attackers back to nearby villages in tanks andarmored personnel carriers behind a heavy artillery cover, thespokesman said.   An Amal commander in Sidon, identified only by his code-name ofAbu Jamal, confirmed that the attack failed.   ``Jbaa is a mountain peak. Our fighters are in the valleys and wehave to climb up to the Hezbollahis. This is not an easy task,'' hesaid.   Abu Jamal said his forces blocked all supply lines to thenine-square-mile enclave, which stretches southeast from Jbaa to thenearby hamlets of Ein Bouswar and Louwaizeh and the wooded slopes ofMount Safi.   ``We will besiege them for a while, until they run out ofsupplies and ammunition and then try again. We don't want tosacrifice our fighters in a battle than we can win easily after awhile,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
