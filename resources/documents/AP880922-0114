He was holding mylegs. I was trying to push him off,'' the 19-year-old woman said ofdefendant Orlando Garza, 23, the first to be tried of the 10 menindicted in the case.   She said Garza was laughing as he raped her on the hood of acar, and that other men nearby joined in and also sexuallyassaulted her. After she had testified for about one hour, thecourt recessed when the woman, in tears, said she was about tofaint.   On Wednesday, the doctor who examined the woman said she wasscratched and bruised, including internal bruises, when she arrivedat a hospital for treatment.   ``She told me she had been sexually assaulted by as many as 20to 23 men,'' said Dr. Vilma Garcia, who examined her at HumanaHospital-Corpus Christi on March 27.   The woman said ``that they were her neighbors,'' Garciatestified Wednesday in the sexual assault trial.   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez said he expectedthe woman to continue her testimony later today.   The woman, who was a resident of San Diego at the time, toldauthorities she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the menover a period of several hours on the night of March 26-27.   All 10 have pleaded innocent to charges including kidnapping,aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault.   ``This was not a kidnapping,'' defense attorney Albert Pena saidin an interview Wednesday. ``She voluntarily went.''   Jose Carlos Briones testified Wednesday that the woman scratchedher attackers, cried out for help and fainted while she was beingraped on the hood of a car outside town.   Briones, 29, said the woman cried: ``Help me, please help me.''   ``She was moaning and groaning. She had tears in her eyes,''Briones said in Spanish through an interpreter.   ``I was the only one who told them to leave her alone,'' saidBriones, who also faces a sexual assault charge in the case.   Prosecutors have promised to recommend probation for Briones inexchange for his testimony. Briones says he was impotent at thetime of the attack from drinking too much beer.   When Pena asked him if the woman was making sounds of pleasure,Briones answered: ``It was nothing about being happy.''   He said Garza held the woman's wrists during part of the attack.   ``He (Garza) told me to hold her because she was scratchinghim,'' Briones said.   Briones said he saw several of the other defendants assaultingthe woman.   Sexual assault is punishable by two to 20 years in prison and-ora fine of up to $10,000.   The woman, her husband and two children have moved to anundisclosed location in another city because of reported harassmentsince she accused the 10 men.</TEXT></DOC>
