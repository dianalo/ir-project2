Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger, during his rebuttalarguments Wednesday, portrayed Minkow as someone who committed fraudfor his own personal gain.   ``He loved the high life. He was motivated not by threats. He wasmotivated by his own personal desires,'' said Asperger. ``BarryMinkow was doing it for himself.''   Minkow, on trial on fraud charges, has testified that he bilkedinvestors out of millions of dollars but did so only becausemobsters had taken over his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company andwere threatening his life.   The jury was scheduled to receive instructions today, beginningdeliberations afterward.   Minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities, credit-card andmail fraud. The government contends major banks and securities firmslost millions of dollars along with individual investors as a resultof Minkow's alleged scheme.   During his closing arguments earlier Wednesday, Minkow's attorneyaccused the government of engineering a massive cover-up of itsfailure to short circuit the $15 million ZZZZ Best stock fraud.   Attorney David Kenner said the FBI improperly dropped a probe ofMinkow's possible mob victimization in 1986 before his company hitWall Street.   ``I think the government made a mistake,'' said Kenner. ``Theydidn't do anything.''   Minkow, who launched his carpet-cleaning business at 16 in hisparents' garage, became familiar to millions of Californians throughhis television ads and talk show appearances.   But he admitted during the four-month trial that his business was``86 percent fraud.'' He had told investors that ZZZZ Best wasmaking a fortune restoring fire and water damaged buildings when nosuch jobs existed.</TEXT></DOC>
