A police spokesman said the 22-hour battle between the twoChristian forces, which has killed at least 66 people and wounded200, also caused ``colossal'' material losses amounting to``hundreds of millions of dollars.''   ``Many, many houses, shops and even banks have been gutted,'' hesaid.   Gunners of the Lebanese Forces militia and army units were firingsporadically at each other's positions today in the impoverisheddistrict of Ein Rummaneh and its surroundings.   ``If the exchange escalates, it might shatter the cease-fire,''said the police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The leftist newspaper As-Safir called Wednesday's fighting ``theMaronites' black day.'' The army of the Christian-controlledgovernment and the Christian militia are made up mainly of MaronitesCatholics.   The country is now led by two rival governments, one Christianand the other Moslem. The fighting, which began Tuesday and taperedoff with a cease-fire Wednesday, further divided the Christian campin its nearly 14-year-old civil war against the Moslems.   An official at the U.S. Embassy denied radio reports thatAmbassador John McCarthy has decided to evacuate Lebanon with hisentire American staff to the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus.   ``There are no plans for us to leave,'' said the official, whorequested anonymity. He said none of the embassy's estimated 20American staffers had been injured in the fighting, which sent a fewshells crashing 200 yards from the embassy compound in suburbanAukar and broke windows there.   The offices were closed Wednesday and today.   In Wednesday's fight, the army overran militia strongholds tocontrol about 75 percent of the Christian enclave, police said. Theyalso said the army took militia positions in a central mountainrange.</TEXT></DOC>
