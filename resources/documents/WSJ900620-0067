Perry   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/20/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><LP>   ALBANY, N.Y. -- This is a ticket that's not going to playon Broadway -- or hardly anywhere else in New York State.   It's the Republican ticket headed by Pierre Rinfret, awealthy economics consultant from New York City, running forgovernor against Democrat Mario Cuomo and already in hotwater.</LP><TEXT>   But it's only the latest calamity to befall the state'sonce-proud GOP, the empire that was built by Thomas Dewey andNelson Rockefeller. The state party is broke, its upstatebase is crumbling, and even Suffolk County, a Long Islandbastion, has strayed from the GOP path. Worst of all, commandof the GOP fortress, the state Senate, lost to the Democratsonly once (in 1965, for a single year) since World War II, isat risk.   This could be the year that sets the course of New Yorkpolitics for a decade.   Mr. Rinfret (pronounced Rin-fray) is the obvious andvisible symbol of the party's disarray. He was literallychosen out of an address book -- Laurence Leeds's addressbook. Mr. Leeds is a Manhattan investment banker who wasasked for help by a desperate state Sen. Roy Goodman, amember of a search committee charged with finding acandidate. Mr. Leeds flipped through the pages until he cameto &quot;R,&quot; and there was &quot;Rinfret, Pierre.&quot; The 66-year-old Mr.Rinfret agreed to make the run, reportedly pledging anywherefrom $100,000 to $500,000 of his own resources as &quot;earnestmoney&quot; and holding out the possibility that his wealthyclients would come up with lots more. He enrolled as aRepublican after he was chosen as the party's standardbearer. His running mate, George Yancey Jr., the candidatefor lieutenant governor, runs Heluva Good Cheese Inc., inSodus, in upstate New York. His friends call Mr. YanceyGeoff.   The first sign of future trouble was the disclosure thatMr. Rinfret wasn't even a Republican. He was a registeredindependent who thought he was a Republican.   What frustrates many GOP strategists is the belief thatit's the Democrats who should be in trouble. The state'seconomy, which performed vigorously through 1988, is in sharpretreat, and Gov. Cuomo managed to put together this year'sbudget only &quot;by using every ounce of preventive medicine,&quot;according to Richard Nathan, director of the NelsonRockefeller Institute of Government here. &quot;He exhausted allthe possibilities. Now things get really tough.&quot;   But not a single leading Republican would listen to J.Patrick Barrett, the GOP state chairman and former chairmanof Avis Inc., when he made the rounds with a briefcase fullof statewide polls suggesting Mr. Cuomo was more vulnerablethan most people realized. They all turned him down. &quot;Andso,&quot; says Michael Haselswerdt, a political scientist atCanisius College in Buffalo, &quot;the former Avis chairman wasforced -- appropriately enough -- to rent a Republican.&quot;   And as soon as the decision was made, the man who headedthe GOP wish list, Housing and Urban Development SecretaryJack Kemp, turned what appeared to be anembarrassment-in-the-making into low comedy. He lambasted Mr.Rinfret for emphasizing the death penalty as a campaign issueinstead of Mr. Cuomo's record on taxes, and suggested -- theunkindest cut of all -- that Mr. Rinfret, who once advisedPresident Nixon and who now makes millions as a consultant,doesn't understand how the economy functioned in the Reaganyears.   The New York Times weighed in with a front-page storysuggesting Mr. Rinfret fraudulently claims the title&quot;doctor,&quot; even though he has never earned a doctorate. (Hisofficial campaign biography says that he &quot;completed graduatestudies in political economy&quot; at the University of Dijon, inFrance, in 1950 and that he received an honorary doctor oflaws degree from Pepperdine University in 1973.) The Timesalso reported that some former Nixon advisers deny Mr.Rinfret was a major adviser to the president. (At the time,though, he was quoted in the syndicated Evans and Novakcolumn with such frequency that he irritated White Housecolleagues.)   Mr. Rinfret issued a statement saying it is his &quot;earnesthope that the Times will focus attention on the real issuesof this campaign&quot; and released a letter from former PresidentNixon saying he had hoped Mr. Rinfret &quot;would join myadministration as a member of the Council of EconomicAdvisers or later as a member of the cabinet.&quot;   If Mr. Rinfret turns out to be a calamitous choice to headthe ticket, Republicans will have only themselves to blame.   Party professionals worry that an election that should bea referendum on Mr. Cuomo's performance in office is turningout to be a showcase for Mr. Rinfret's astonishing,freewheeling performance. In his initial outings, Mr. Rinfretpromised he would privatize New York City's subways, airportsand bridges. &quot;He's just inviting someone to ask if he's hadany good offers for the Brooklyn Bridge,&quot; says MaristInstitute pollster Lee Miringoff.   Mr. Rinfret caused veteran GOP operatives to blanch whenhe invited a woman reporter to his inaugural ball -- andurged her to leave her husband at home. He threatens tobecome an East Coast version of Texas' Clayton Williams, thatstate's gaffe-prone Republican candidate for governor, thedifference being that Texans may be more tolerant ofpolitical eccentricity than New Yorkers.   To make matters worse, two other parties appealing toprospective GOP voters, the Conservative and Right to Lifeparties, are running their own anti-abortion candidates forgovernor. Mr. Rinfret supports abortion rights for women, inline with the state party's recently adopted stance.   &quot;The Republican Party has lost its way,&quot; says MichaelLong, chairman of the Conservative Party. &quot;Our party isrunning the only bona fide Republican in the race&quot; -- HerbertLondon, a dean at New York University, who sought theRepublican endorsement. &quot;When this election is over,&quot; saysMr. Long, &quot;Pierre Andre Rinfret will be gone. He's notsticking around to rebuild the Republican Party.&quot;   A thorough rebuilding is what the state party needs. Sofar, however, the most visible commitment has been the$250,000 Mr. Barrett spent to refurbish the party's eleganttownhouse headquarters. &quot;We thought it was important,&quot; saysMr. Barrett. (The Democrats rent shabby space in anundistinguished downtown office building.)   The state party also borrowed $400,000 to buy astate-of-the-art computer system for the GOP state Senatecampaign committee, which is already rolling in money. &quot;We'revery generous,&quot; says Mr. Barrett. To top it off, the party'sbookkeeping is under investigation by the State Board ofElections.   Traditionally, the party's base has been upstate and inthe New York City suburbs. But, Mr. Barrett acknowledges,&quot;there has been some erosion in our base.&quot; In upstate NewYork, Democrats now control Erie County (including Buffalo)and Monroe County (Rochester) and even Broome County(Binghamton). On Long Island, they control Suffolk County.The Republicans have fallen back on machine-controlled Nassauand Westchester counties.   &quot;They've lost their triple-A minor-league franchises,&quot;says William Cunningham, a political consultant who speaksfor the state Democratic Party.   But the scariest part of all for the GOP is its fear thatit could lose control of the 61-seat state Senate, theparty's last remaining bastion. (The Democrats traditionallycontrol the Assembly and they have held the governor's seatfor the past 16 years.) The Democrats need a net gain of fourSenate seats to win control.   &quot;If we lose the Senate,&quot; says Robert Haggerty, executivedirector of the Republican Senate campaign committee, &quot;welose everything.&quot; With Democrats in control everywhere, saysMr. Haggerty, they would redistrict the state legislature andthe seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. &quot;They willredistrict us out of business,&quot; Mr. Haggerty says. At a timewhen the state faces a post-census loss of three seats toredistricting, the Republicans fear they could lose six tounfettered Democratic gerrymandering.   And so the money is bypassing the state party and flowingdirectly to the Senate races. &quot;They'll spend $4 million,&quot;says the Democrats' Mr. Cunningham. &quot;We'll spend $1 million.&quot;   The importance the national party puts on these Senateraces was highlighted earlier this week. Vice President DanQuayle had been scheduled to attend a fund-raiser for thestate party. But those plans were changed; Monday night, heattended a $5,000-a-plate dinner for the state Senatecommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
