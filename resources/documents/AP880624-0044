Dukakis was coping withother home-state headaches as well, including an FBI probe of hisadministration's selection of a prison site.   Bush was flying to Cincinnati today for a GOP unity conference,and the Republicans were expected to have a field day with Dukakis'tax move. Several of Bush's former rivals for the nomination _Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig andChristian broadcaster Pat Robertson were to be on hand for theRepublican event.   Dukakis on Thursday signed a $40 million state cigarette tax andsaid he supported raising another $75 million by bringing theMassachusetts tax code in line with federal tax provisions.   The state faces a $400 million deficit in the current fiscalyear, but Dukakis defended his ability to manage a budget, sayingit stood in ``sharp contrast'' to the record of the Reaganadministration.   The Bush camp's reaction to Dukakis' action was swift _ and abit gleeful.   ``It's obvious that his reaction is to tax,'' said Bushspokeswoman Sheila Tate. ``Instead of cutting (spending), he raisedtaxes. It seems to speak for itself.''   Bush has already been getting a lot of campaign-trail mileageout of tax issues, making frequent reference to ``tax-and-spend''Democrats. Dukakis has said he would raise federal income taxesonly as a last resort.   The paths of the presidential rivals nearly crossed Thursdaynight in Washington _ Bush and Dukakis posed separately, a fewhours apart, for pictures with visiting Australian Prime MinisterBob Hawke.   Dukakis was in Washington for a Democratic fund-raiser beforeheading off today for a four-day vacation on the island ofNantucket in Massachusetts.   Democrat Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, was in Puerto Rico today. Theisland's residents do not vote in the general election, but Jacksonwas angling for a share of Puerto Rico's 57 delegates to theDemocratic National Convention.   Jackson was greeted on his arrival Thursday night by theterritory's governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, who said earlier inthe day that he was considering Jackson's request that he be givensome of the delegates. Jackson won Puerto Rico's non-bindingprimary in March but most of the delegates have said they wouldvote for Dukakis at the convention.   The Jackson forces are taking a conciliatory approach todelegate questions, though. On Thursday, Democrats agreed to a listof delegates to next month's national convention.   But Jackson has put the Dukakis campaign on notice that heintends to keep pressing platform demands unacceptable to Dukakis _including a call for new taxes on the wealthy and support for aPalestinian homeland. A Democratic committee was convening today inDenver to continue work on the platform draft.   Jackson was also keeping alive the issue of whether he should beDukakis' running mate. He's said he ought to be asked _ but won'tsay if he actually wants the job.   Jackson told reporters in Washington on Thursday that he hasmade up his mind about whether he wants a spot on the ticket, butsaid he's not telling anyone what his private verdict was _ noteven Dukakis.   ``That would be public,'' he said.   Dukakis has repeatedly said that many people are beingconsidered for the No. 2 spot, and said Thursday he wasn't close toa decision on a running mate.   ``You're going to have to wait on that for a while,'' he said.   Dukakis, spending one last day tending to business beforebeginning his vacation, was beset by a series of woes on Thursday.   After signing the cigarette tax, he brushed aside questionsabout the political repercussions of raising taxes in the midst ofhis presidential campaign, saying that his main concern was to``make sure that the state's fiscal base is solid and strong.''   The tax action followed a day of questions about a federalinvestigation of the Dukakis administration's plan to build aprison in the small town of New Braintree.   Local officials have accused the Dukakis administration oftailoring a deal on the site because the co-owners of the propertyare longtime acquaintances of the governor and one co-owner hascontributed to Dukakis' presidential campaign.   The FBI, which does not usually confirm when a probe is underway, said it revealed the investigation because of Dukakis' statusas a presidential contender. The FBI said Dukakis was not a targetof the probe, but said the investigation had not reached a stage inwhich subjects would be singled out.   Dukakis denied any wrongdoing, saying the suggestion that hisadministration had acted improperly was ``unfortunate andregrettable.''   Also Thursday, former Dukakis education adviser Gerard T.Indelicato was accused of larceny and forgery related to his stateduties. He had previously pleaded guilty to separate federalcharges of fraud and conspiracy.   Dukakis called the charges ``very serious, more so because theyallege a violation of the public trust.''</TEXT></DOC>
