The amendmentsare needed to revise and clarify certain OCC interpretations of statutesthat principally govern the payment of dividends by national banks (12U.S.C. 56 andamp; 60). The intended effect is to make the calculation ofnational banks' dividend-paying capacity consistent with generally acceptedaccounting principles (GAAP). In this regard, the allowance for loan andlease losses will not be considered an element of either ``undivided profitsthen on hand'' or ``net profits''. Further, a national bank may be ableto use a portion of its capital surplus account as ``undivided profitsthen on hand,'' depending on the composition of that account. In addition,the proposed amendments would clarify that dividends on preferred stockare not subject to the limitations of 12 U.S.C. 56, while explicitly makingsuch dividends subject to the constraints of 12 U.S.C. 60. The amendmentsdo not diminish or impair a well-capitalized bank's ability to make cashpayments to its shareholders in the form of a return of capital. Moreover,some banks may be able to take remedial measures to restore their abilityto pay a dividend either by consummating a quasi-reorganization or issuingpreferred stock not subject to the dividend limitation of 12 U.S.C. 56.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by October 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be directed to: Communications Division,5th Floor, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East, SW., Washington, DC 20219; Attention:Jacqueline England; Docket No. 89-11.

A major contributor to a bank's capitalis the quality of its earnings, and the amount of earnings that are retainedand added to capital. Earnings that are paid out to stockholders in theform of cash dividends reduce the level of a bank's capital support. Thereare two sections of the National Bank Act that must be satisfied beforea national bank can declare a dividend_12 U.S.C. 56 andamp; 60. While both place a limit on a bank's ability to pay a cash dividend, thesetwo sections serve different functions. Section 56 is a capital impairmentlimitation and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">No association * * * shall, during the time it shall continue itsbanking operations, withdraw, or permit to be withdrawn, either in theform of dividends or otherwise, any portion of its capital. If losses haveat any time been sustained by any such association, equal to or exceedingits undivided profits then on hand, no dividend shall be made; and no dividendshall ever be made by any association * * * to an amount greater than itsnet profits then on hand * * *.</ITAG>In addition to the capital limitation, the National Bank Act contains anearnings limitation by providing, in andSection;60(b):<ITAG tagnum="21">The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency shall be requiredif the total of all dividends declared by such association in any calendaryear shall exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined withits retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any requiredtransfers to surplus * * *.</ITAG>Thus, sections 56 and 60 set up a two-part test for determining the extentto which national banks may pay dividends. If a proposed dividend wouldviolate the provisions of section 56, the constraints imposed by section60 are irrelevant, because section 56 is an absolute bar to the paymentof dividends that would exceed the bank's ``net profits then on hand.''If a bank has the requisite unimpaired capital under section 56, only thenmust it be concerned with the recent-earnings test of section 60. Furthermore,if a proposed dividend is payable under Section 56, but fails the testof section 60, the bank may still be allowed to pay the dividend, but onlywith ``the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency.'' The OCC has issued interpretive rulings dealing with both sections 56 and60. Interpretative Ruling 7.6125 (12 CFR 7.6125) interprets the provisionsof 12 U.S.C. 56, and focuses exclusively on so-called ``statutory bad debt.''(section 56 requires that a bank deduct ``its lossess and bad debts'' fromits ``net profits then on hand.'') The statute gives some guidance as towhat assets are to be considered bad debts, but I.R. 7.6125 provides muchmore explanation as to what constitutes, for example, a debt that is ``wellsecured and in the process of collection.'' Interpretive Ruling 7.6100(12 CFR 7.6100) is primarily a recitation of 12 U.S.C. 60; however, italso deals with portions of 12 U.S.C. 51b and 1828(b).Both sections 56 and 60 were passed as part of the National Bank Act of1864. In the time since it was enacted, section 56 has never been amended.Section 60 was amended in 1935 and again in 1959.\1\<NOTE/> In addition to Interpretive Rulings 7.6100 and 7.6125, theOCC has issued a number of interpretations of sections 56 and 60 in the125 years since they became law. These interpretations have been both formaland informal. Furthermore, not all of these interpretations have been consistentin their opinions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Act of August 23, 1935, c. 614, 315, 49 Stat. 712; and Pub.L. 96-230, 21(a), 73 Stat. 465. <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose </ITAG>The purpose of this notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPRM'') is to formalizethe OCC's opinions in the area of the payment of dividends by nationalbanks and to communicate these views to the national banking community.In addition to the need for consistent interpretation of the relevant statutoryprovisions, the OCC is amending Interpretive Rulings 7.6100 and 7.6125to conform to GAAP. Furthermore, the OCC is transforming these interpretiverulings into regulations, the violation of which would be the basis foran enforcement action. Thus, these dividend regulations will be legallybinding on both the agency and the industry. The new regulations will becontained in the corporate activities provisions of the OCC's exsitingregulations_12 CFR Part 5. <ITAG tagnum="84">Issues </ITAG>The issue of when a bank can legally pay a dividend, and the amount ofthat dividend, is complicated by an antiquated statutory scheme. Sections56 and 60 were enacted long before the creation of today's accrual accountingsystem, with its allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). The terminologyused in these statutes is not precise in the context of today's accountingprinciples. As a result, there is ambiguity and uncertainty concerningseveral accounting issues when applying these statutes to specific factsituations. Accordingly, the NPRM deals with the following issues: 1. What portion of a bank's ``capital surplus'' account should be availablefor the payment of dividends? 2. How should the ALLL be treated for purposes of calculating a nationalbank's dividend-paying capacity? 3. Should dividends on a bank's preferred stock be subject to the samelimitations as dividends on its common stock? With respect to payments of dividends to holders of common stock, theseissues can be summarized in two questions: (a) For pruposes of section56, what is included in ``undivided profits then on hand''; and (b) forpurposes of section 60, are provisions made to the ALLL part of ``net profits''?For preferred stock dividends, one must initially determine whether section56 and/or section 60 are applicable. To the extent either section is applicable,the issues outlined above must also be considered with respect to dividendson preferred stock. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Capital Surplus </ITAG>A bank that sustains losses in excess of its undivided profits then onhand, and then returns to profitability, often begins to look for waysto legally pay dividends out of current earnings, notwithstanding a negativebalance in its historical retained earnings account. If a bank's surplusfund were considered part of ``undivided profits then on hand,'' \2\<NOTE/> many of these banks could legally pay a dividend since theirsurplus funds would, in most cases, more than offset their negative retainedearnings.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Although 12 U.S.C. 56 uses the terms ``undivided profitsthen on hand'' and ``net profits then on hand'' in the same sentence, theOCC has, for a number of years, considered them to be interchangeable.<T3>See Digest of Opinions of the OCC, </T3>No. 6305 (1960 ed.). Thereis no case law that defines or distinguishes these terms, and the legislativehistory to the National Bank Act provides no instruction as to their meaning.Furthermore, ``net profits'' as used in Section 60 has a different meaningfrom ``net profits then on hand'' as used in Section 56. Thus, in thisNPRM, when discussing Section 56, the OCC will use the term ``undividedprofits then on hand.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>OCC No Objection Letter No. 88-10, December 8, 1988,reprinted in <T3>Fed. Banking L. Rep. </T3>andpara; <T2>XXX</T2> (CCH 1989). Pursuant to 60(a), a national bank's ``surplus fund (must) equal its commoncapital.'' Most banks have surplus in excess of the amount required by60(a), because there was a time in the OCC's history when retained earnings(or undivided profits) did not qualify as capital for such things as computingthe total amount a bank could lend to one borrower. A national bank, inorder to increase its lending limit, had to transfer retained earningsto the surplus fund. The portion of the surplus fund in excess of whatis required by 60(a) has become known as ``surplus surplus.'' The OCC has a number of options for dealing with the question of what partof the surplus fund qualifies as undivided profits. The two extremes areto interpret section 56 to say either none or all of the surplus fund isincluded in undivided profits. Because of section 60(a)'s required transfersto surplus, it is reasonable to conclude that, for purposes of section56, ``capital'' includes not only common and preferred stock but also theportion of the surplus fund that is equal to common capital. Thus, it wouldseem an appropriate interpretation is somewhere between the two extremes.In this middle ground, there are at least two possibilities: (a) All surplussurplus is included in undivided profits; or (b) only the portion of surplussurplus that came from the earnings of prior periods qualifies as undividedprofits. The <T3>Digest of Opinions of the OCC, </T3>No. 6305 (1960 ed.) states, ``[T]hefollowing capital-structure accounts constitute a bank's profits whichare legally available for the payment of dividends: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. That portion, if any, of the surplus account which is in excessof the amount of the common capital account (; and) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The undivided-profits account.'' </ITAG>This Opinion was not carried forward into the Comproller's Manual for NationalBanks and has never been adopted as an interpretive ruling. Furthermore,Opinion No. 6305 has not been cited by the OCC in a public document forover 25 years. Nonetheless, it provides authority for saying that at leasta portion of the surplus fund should be included in undivided profits whencalculating dividend-paying capacity.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\<T3>See also </T3>Letter from Justin Watson to Robert Ellyson, January26, 1967 (OCC does not actively encourage banks to retransfer excess surplus,but it is within the prudent judgment of the board of directors to do so).Rather than following Opinion No. 6305 and saying that all of a bank'ssurplus surplus (even the portion that was paid in by shareholders or createdthrough other means, <T3>e.g., </T3>a stock dividend) is legally available for the payment ofdividends, this NPRM adopts an approach whereby only earned surplus surplusqualifies as ``undivided profits than on hand.'' This would prevent a bankfrom paying dividends out of its paid-in capital_something that would bea return of capital requiring OCC and shareholder approval under 12 U.S.C.59. In addition, this NPRM proivdes that OCC approval must be obtainedbefore a bank can ``unbundle'' its surplus surplus by transferring anyportion back to undivided profits. Thus, before a bank can move a portionof its earned surplus to undivided profits through the process describedin this NPRM, the bank must seek and obtain OCC approval of the transaction.Accordingly, some banks may be able to eliminate their deficit or negativeundivided profits by an approved transfer of earned ``suprlus surplus''and, as a result, be repositioned to resume the payment of dividends outof current earnings. Moreover, a national bank that is profitable and well-capitalized,but is precluded from paying a dividend under section 56, may be able topay cash to its common shareholders through a return of capital under 12U.S.C. 59. However, this can only be done with the approval of both theOCC and two-thirds of the bank's shareholders. It should be noted thatthe OCC's approval is not likely to be forthcoming unless the bank has:adequate capital, high-quality earnings and future prospects that ensureits continued profitability. Other methods by which the bank's shareholdersmay be able to receive a return on their investment are through a quasi-reorganizationor the use of preferred stock. OCC approval must be obtained before a bankcan transfer unearned surplus to undivided profits_<T3>e.g., </T3>through the process of a quasi-reorganization or other corporaterestructuring.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses</ITAG>Determining the appropriate treatment for provisions made to the ALLL ispertinent to calculating dividend-paying capacity under both sections 56and 60. For purposes of section 56, the question is: Should a bank be allowedto include its ALLL when calculating its undivided profits then on hand?Pursuant to section 60, a similar question exists: Wheat is the appropriatetreatment for provisions to the ALLL when determining the amount of a bank'snet profits?A. 12 U.S.C. 56As stated previously, Section 56 is a capital impairment test and is basedon a bank's capital and retained earnings)_<T3>i.e., </T3>a bank cannot pay a dividend if its capital is impairedor if the payment of the dividend would impair its capital. Under GAAP,provisions to the ALLL are charged against earnings and are not part ofundivided profits; therefore, pursuant to GAAP, the ALLL is not availablefor the payment of dividends. Furthermore, including the ALL in undividedprofits then on hand can produce some undesirable results_<T3>e.g., </T3>a bank with a negative balance in undivided profits thenon hand could legally pay a dividend.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In such a situation, GAAP would not preclude a bank frompaying out cash to its shareholders; however, the payment would be returnof capital, not a dividend. For national banks, such a return of capitalwould require shareholder and OCC approval. <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 59.In addition, the ALLL is a contra-asset account reflecting the losses inherent(but unidentified) in the loan and lease portfolio. The OCC believes thatprovisions to the ALLL should be available when the losses are identifiedor actually realized and, therefore, should not be considered availablefor distribution to the bank's shareholders in the form of cash dividends.This NPRM prohibits national banks from adding the ALLL to its undividedprofits then on hand when calculating the amount of dividends it can payunder 12 U.S.C. 56.One potential concern with this interpretation arises from the requirementin section 56 that a bank deduct its ``losses and bad debts'' from itsundivided profits then on hand. It is arguable that this ``statutory baddebt'' provision was Congress' proxy for the ALLL. At the time section56 was enacted, the ALLL used under today's accounting principles did notexist. Further, banks did not always charge off losses which had been identified.To ameliorate the effects of requiring banks to deduct their statutorybad debt from their undivided profits then on hand, without first allowingthem to add their ALLL to undivided profits then on hand, the OCC is proposingto permit banks to net statutory bad debts against the ALLL. To the extenta bank has statutory bad debts in excess of its ALLL, the excess will bededucted from undivided profits then on hand. However, a bank with an ALLLgreater than its statutory bad debts may not include this excess ALLL inits undivided profits then on hand.B. 12 U.S.C. 60The issue of whether the ALLL should be considered part of ``net profits''is more complicated in the earnings test of section 60, since that sectionprovides:<ITAG tagnum="21">For the purpose of this section the term ``net profits'' shall meanthe remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoverieson loans and investments and other assets, after decucting from the totalthereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividendson preferred stock, if any, and all Federal and State taxes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">12 U.S.C. 60(c).</ITAG>Upon initial review, this definition would not seem to leave room for muchinterpretation. However, because it was written at a time when a majorityof banks were on a cash basis of accounting, rather than an accrual basis,there was no mention of the ALLL.\6\<NOTE/> The question then becomes: How should provisions, chargeoffs and recoveries recorded in a bank's ALLL be treated in determiningits dividend-paying capacity under the earnings test of 12 U.S.C. 60? Accordingto GAAP, provisions to the ALLL are charged against current earnings, asa current operating expense, and do not represent net income availableto shareholders. Further, actual losses and recoveries do not directlyaffect the earnings of a bank, only its ALLL_<T3>i.e., </T3>the ALLL is decreased when actual loan losses are incurredand increased when actual recoveries are made.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Section 60(c) was added in 1959 by Pub. L. 86-230; however,because most banks did not use the accrual method of accounting at thattime, the legislative history does not shed any light on how the ALLL isto be treated. <T3>See </T3>1959 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News, p. 2232.This NPRM interprets section 60 in a manner consistent with GAAP. Accordingly,loan loss provisions charged to earnings by a bank are not added back toearnings when computing ``net profits''. In addition, net charge offs_<T3>i.e., </T3>actual losses minus actual recoveries_are not deducted from``net profits''.By adding provisions made to its ALLL back to net profits, a bank can significantlyincrese the amount of cash dividends it can legally pay to its shareholderswithout regulatory approval, something which may be considered an unsafeand unsound banking practice. The ALLL represents losses inherent in theloan and lease portfolio and, as such, the OCC believes provisions to itshould not be considered as available to shareholders for cash dividends.This is not to say that a national bank is legally barred from paying dividendsin excess of its retained net income for the year to date plus the priortwo years. However, before a bank can pay such a dividend, the OCC shouldhave the opportunity to review carefully the bank's financial conditionand future prospects, and determine whether such a dividend is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Preferred Stock </ITAG>Since section 56 and 60 are not limited by their terms to common stockdividends, it is arguable that the limitations of those sections are alsoapplicable to preferred stock dividends. However, 12 U.S.C. 51b provides,in relevant part: <ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whether relating torestriction upon the payment of dividends upon capital stock or otherwise,the holders of such preferred stock shall be entitled to receive such cumulativedividends * * * as may be provided in the articles of association withthe approval of the Comptroller of the Currency * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) No dividends shall be declared or paid on common stock until thecumulative dividends on the preferred stock shall have been paid in full* * *. </ITAG>Thus, the plain words of section 51b(a) indicate that cumulative dividendson preferred stock are not restricted by the terms of sections 56 and 60.Nonetheless, when the provisions of section 51b are read in the contextof the overall statutory scheme they become ambiguous. Furthermore, itis the opinion of the OCC that the policies behind sections 51b, 56, and60 dictate a result that is contrary to what might be suggested by a literalreading of 12 U.S.C. 51b(a). Section 51b was contained in the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, which wasintended to rehabilitate banks with impaired capital by authorizing themto issue preferred stock to the public or the Reconstruction Finance Corporation(RFC). (Before the passage of this Act, national banks could not issuepreferred stock.) This provision was immediately amended in June of 1933,and the legislative history to this amendment provides some insight asto the intent of the drafters. As originally enacted, section 51b read, in pertinent part, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The holders of such preferred stock shall be entitled to cumulativedividends at a rate not exceeding 6 per centum per annum * * *. Notwithstandingany other provision of law, the holders of such preferred stock shall havesuch voting rights, and such stock shall be subject to such retirementin such manner and on such terms and conditions, as may be provided inthe articles of association with the approval of the Comptroller of theCurrency. </ITAG>Emergency Banking Act, March 9, 1933, ch. 1, Title III Section 302, 48Stat. 5. According to the RFC, this provision put it ``in the position of eitherhaving to refuse assistance (to banks whose common stock was impaired),or having to take preferred stock * * * with no possibility of receiving.''\7\<NOTE/> Thus, at the behest of the RFC, the provisions of the EmergencyBanking Act that dealt with preferred stock and its dividends were rearrangedso that the payment of cumulative dividends was authorized ``[n]otwithstandingany other provision of law.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ S. Rep. No. 43, 73rd Cong., 1st Sess. 1-3 (1933). A. 12U.S.C. 56In spite of the language of section 51b and its legislative history, someprior OCC opinions have argued that dividends on preferred stock cannotbe made if the bank has sustained losses in excess of ``its undivided profitsthen on hand.'' While some of these arguments are persuasive, the OCC nowbelieves that the better interpretation is that preferred stock dividendsare not subject to the limitations of 12 U.S.C. 56. According to the legislativehistory, the RFC was concerned that section 56 would prevent it from gettinga return on its investment (of Government funds) in a bank that had currentearnings, unless section 51b was amended specifically to override the limitationsof section 56. In other words, the RFC had injected new funds into an otherwiseinsolvent institution and wanted to receive dividends out of the earningsthat had been generated from its investment_something that may have beenprohibited by section 56 prior to the June 1933 amendments to section 51b.Thus, the OCC does not believe that it would be correct to interpret section56 as being applicable to cash dividends on preferred stock. B. 12 U.S.C. 60 As mentioned previously, section 60 has been amended twice since it wasenacted as part of the National Bank Act of 1864. It is the legislativehistory of these amendments, when read in conjunction with the legislativehistory of the June 1933 amendments to section 51b, that supports the OCC'sconclusion that the recent-earnings limitation of 12 U.S.C. 60(b) appliesto preferred stock dividends. The legislative history of the 1959 amendments to section 60 is particularlyimportant. Although preferred stock is not mentioned as being expresslycovered by the provisions of the section, the amendments added the recent-earningslimitation for ``(t)he purpose of * * * prevent(ing) excessive dividendsto shareholders where such payments would result in the dissipation ofneeded capital funds * * *.'' \8\<NOTE/> The clear Congressional intent of the 1959 amendments tosection 60 is served by applying the recent-earnings test to preferredstock dividends. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 105 Cong. Rec. 15398, August 24, 1959 (statements of RepresentativeBrown of Georgia). Furthermore, this interpretation of section 60 is consistent with the policyand legislative history of section 51b. When section 51b was enacted, section60 did not limit dividends based on a bank's recent earnings; thus, itis not surprising that the legislative history of section 51b does notmention the provision's effect on section 60. Additionally, it is reasonableto conclude that the RFC was seeking dividends only from current earnings,because it made statements to the effect that the March 1933 version ofsection 51b prevented the payment of dividends ``even though current earningsare sufficient for such payment.'' S. Rep. No. 43 at 2. The OCC invites public comment on all aspects of this NPRM, but specificallyseeks responses to the following questions: 1. What portion of a bank's ``capital surplus'' account should be availablefor the payment of dividends? 2. How should the allowance for loan and lease losses be treated for purposesof calculating a national bank's dividend-paying capacity?3. Should dividends on a bank's preferred stock be subject to the samelimitations as dividends on its common stock?<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is certifiedthat these amendments will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a preliminary RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>It is certified that this proposed rule does not constitute a ``major rule''and, therefore, does not require the preparation of a preliminary regulatoryimpact analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The collections of information contained in andSection;andSection; 5.61 and5.62 of this notice of proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).

This information is required by the OCC to ensure the continued safetyand soundness of national banks. This information will be used by the OCCto evaluate specific applications by national banks and to prevent potentiallyunsafe and unsound practices. The likely respondents are national banks,possibly including some small national banks.  Section 5.61(c)(4)(ii) Burden Information  This is a usual and customary recordkeeping practice affirmed by the regulation.The OCC has assigned one recordkeeping burden hour to this requirementonly to show that it was reviewed by OMB.  Section 5.61(d)(3)(iii) Burden Information  (This is a new collection of information and is being added to existingOMB control number 1557-0155.)  The estimated number of respondents is 100 for the first year and 20 peryear thereafter, with each respondent submitting one response per year. The estimated annual burden per response will vary, based on the lengthof time the bank has been in operation and the number of transactions inits surplus account over those years. However, most of the material neededto prepare the request for approval will be available through usual andcustomary records. The OCC estimates that the average time required fora typical response will be 10 burden hours.  100 (year one)+20 (year two)+20 (year three) divided by 3 years=an estimatedaverage of 47 respondents per year.  47 respondentsandmultiply;1 response=47 annual responses.  47 responsesandmultiply;10 burdens hours=470 estimated annual burden hours.

The total estimated number of respondents is 145 with one response peryear.  The estimated annual burden per response may vary, depending on individualcircumstances, however, since all of the material needed to prepare therequest for approval of the Deputy Comptroller will be available throughusual and customary records, the OCC estimates the average burden to preparethe letter request is approximately one hour.  145 responsesandmultiply;1 burden hour=145 estimated annual burden hours. <ITAG tagnum="84">Total Burden  </ITAG>192(47+145) respondentsandmultiply;1 response=192 annual responses.  192 annual responsesandmultiply;3.2 burden hours per response=615 estimatedannual reporting burden hours.  1 recordkeeper at 1 hour=1 annual recordkeeping burden hour attributableto andSection; 5.61(d)(4)(iii).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 5 and 7  </ITAG>National banks, reporting and requirements, securities.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance  </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, parts 5 and 7 of chapter I oftitle 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amendedas set forth below:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 5_ RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR CORPORATE ACTIVITIES </ITAG>1.

If losseshave at any time been sustained by any such association, equal to or exceedingits undivided profits then on hand, no dividend shall be made; and no dividendshall ever be made; and no dividend shall ever be made by an association,while it continues its banking operations, to an amount greater than itsnet profits then on hand, deducting therefrom its losses and bad debts.All debts due to any association, on which interest is past due and unpaidfor a period of six months, unless the same are well secured, and in theprocess of collection, shall be considered bad debts within the meaningof this section. But nothing in this section shall prevent the reductionof the capital stock of the association under section 59 of this title.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Rules of general applicability. </T3>The rules of general applicabilitycontained in subpart A of this part do not apply to applications underthis section.  (c) <T3>Statutory bad debt. </T3>Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 56, bad debts must bededucted from net profits then on hand in computing funds available forthe payment of dividends on common stocks. Bad debts, as that term is usedin the statute, means matured obligations due a national bank on whichinterest is past due and unpaid for six months unless the debts are wellsecured and in the process of collection. Every type of overdue indebtednessowing to the bank must be considered, including loans and investment securities.The six month period of default of interest may begin at any time, regardlessof when the debt matures.  (1) <T3>Matured debt. </T3>Whether a debt has matured for purposes of the statuteusually will be determined by applicable contract law. Generally, a debtis matured when all or part of the principal is due and payable as theresult of demand, arrival of the stated maturity date, acceleration bycontract or by operation of law. Nevertheless, any demand debt on whichthe payment of interest is six months past due will be considered maturedeven though payment of the debt has not been demanded. Installment loanson which any payment is six months past due will be considered maturedeven though acceleration of the total debt may not have occurred.  (2) <T3>Well secured debt. </T3>A debt is well secured within the meaning ofthe statute if it is secured by collateral in the form of liens on, orpledges of, real or personal property, including securities, having realizablevalue sufficient to discharge the debt in full, or by the guaranty of afinancially responsible party. In the event that the loan is partiallysecured, only that portion not properly secured will be considered a statutorybad debt.(3) <T3>Debt in the process of collection. </T3>A debt is in the process ofcollection if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course, eitherthrough legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or, inappropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legalaction which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debtor in its restoration to current status. In any case, the bank should havea plan of collection setting forth the reasons for the selected methodof collection, the responsibilities of the bank and the borrower, and theexpected date of repayment of the debt or its restoration to current status.(4) <T3>Miscellaneous.</T3>_(i) <T3>Debts of bankrupt or deceased debtors. </T3>A claim duly filed againstthe estate of a bankrupt or deceased debtor is considered as being in theprocess of collection. The obligation will be considered well secured ifit meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; orthe claim of the bank against the estate has been duly filed, the statutoryperiod for filing has expired and the assets of the estate are adequateto discharge all obligations in full.(ii) <T3>Documentation. </T3>The bank must maintain in its files documentationto support its evaluation of the security. In addition, the bank must retain,at a minimum, monthly progress reports on its collection efforts, notingand explaining any deviation from the collection plan.(d) <T3>Undivided profits. </T3>For purposes of 12 U.S.C. 56, the terms ``undividedprofits then on hand'' and ``net profits then on hand'' shall be consideredto have the same meaning, and shall be referred to herein as undividedprofits then on hand.(1) <T3>Allowance for loan and lease losses. </T3>When calculating the amountof dividends a bank can legally pay under 12 U.S.C. 56, the bank is notpermitted to add the balance in its allowance for loan and lease lossesaccount to its undivided profits then on hand.(2) <T3>Statutory bad debt. </T3>When deducting its statutory bad debt fromits undivided profits then on hand, a bank is allowed first to net thesum of its statutory bad debts against the balance in its allowance forloan and lease losses account. If the sum of a bank's statutory bad debtsis greater than its allowance for loan and lease losses, the excess statutorybad debt is then to be deducted from the bank's undivided profits thenon hand.(3) <T3>Surplus surplus. </T3>Pursuant to the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 60(a),a national bank's surplus fund must equal its common capital. To the extenta bank has capital surplus in excess of what is required by section 60(a),this amount, commonly known as ``surplus surplus'', shall be consideredundivided profits then on hand and available for the payment of dividends,provided the following conditions are met:(i) The bank can demonstrate that the surplus surplus came from the earningsof prior periods, excluding the effect of any stock dividend;(ii) The bank's board of directors must approve the transfer of the fundsfrom capital surplus to undivided profits then on hand; and(iii) The bank must request and receive the approval of the OCC beforetransferring funds from capital surplus to undivided profits then on hand.Requests for the OCC's approval should be submitted to the appropriateDistrict Deputy Comptroller or the Deputy Comptroller for MultinationalBanking.(e) <T3>Preferred stock. </T3>The provisions of 12 U.S.C. 56 are not applicableto dividends on preferred stock.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number1557-0155)</ITAG>3.
