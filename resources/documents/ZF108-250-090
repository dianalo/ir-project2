 Words starting with I followed by anapostrophe (I'm, I'd, and the like) and the first letters of sentences remaincapitalized when you select Lowercase with Block (Alt-F4), Switch (Shift-F3),or Lowercase (2).andP;  When you block text to be converted, include thepunctuation from the end of the preceding sentence so WordPerfect recognizesthe first letter of the blocked sentence.andP;  (pp.andP;  54-55)andM;2 Versatile Text CenteringandM;Version 5.1 lets you center a string of text around any point on a line, notjust the center of the entire line.andP;  But that also means that centering anexisting line of text won't work if the cursor is not at the beginning of theline when you press Center (Shift-F6).andP;  When the cursor is anywhere otherthan at the beginning of a line, the text is centered around the column wherethe cursor is placed.andP;  When centering text, you can insert a dot leader (arow of dots) from the left margin to the beginning of the centered text bypressing Center (Shift-F6) twice.andP;  To extend dot leaders to the right marginfrom centered text, press Flush Right (Alt-F6) twice.andP;  (pp.andP;  64-67)andM;3 Flush-Right LeadersandM;When typing columns that align flush right, press Home, Home, Flush Right(Alt-F6) to create dot leaders.andP;  (p.andP;  221)andM;4 Formatting DatesandM;Inserting a percent sign before a date format number in the Date Formatscreen (Shift-F5) adds a zero to any number less than ten and abbreviates thenames of the months and days.andP;  For example, %3.andP;  1, 4 (%6) formats dates likethis: Nov. 1, 1990 (Mon).andM;Inserting a dollar sign before a format number adds a space to any numberless than ten.andP;  For example, $2/$1/5 becomes 3/ 6/90.andP;  (pp.andP;  114-115)andM;5 Changing Date NamesandM;You can change the way WordPerfect displays the names of months, days, andtheir abbreviations--helpful if you write in a language other than English.andO;Edit the appropriate entries in the file WP.LRS.andP;  For details, see LanguageResource File on pages 363 to 369 of the manual.andP;  (p.andP;  115)andM;6 Removing HyphenationandM;To cancel hyphenation in a word, move the cursor to the first letter of theword, press Home, type /, and then move to the hyphen and delete it.andP;  (p.andO;303)andM;7 Soft HyphensandM;To indicate where to break an unusual word, move the cursor to where you wantthe word to break and press Home, Enter.andP;  This inserts a soft returncode--[ISRt].andP;  It's useful for telling the program where to break long wordsthat include en-dashes, em-dashes, and slashes (for example,American/Spanish/German/Thai).andP;  (pp.andP;  303-304)andM;8 Block ProtectandM;Even if a Block Protect On code doesn't fall at the beginning of a line, theentire line of text is protected.andP;  (p.andP;  51)andM;Formatting PagesandM;9 Double-Spacing BetweenandM;ParagraphsandM;To insert a double space between single-spaced paragraphs, press Format(Shift-F8), Other (4), Printer Functions (6), Leading Adjustment (6).andP;  PressEnter to accept the default setting for the Primary [SRt] entry, and type 1uat the Secondary [HRt] prompt.andP;  (The u must be lowercase.)andP;  This adds oneline of space to each hard return.andP;  Press Exit (F7) to return to yourdocument.andP;  The extra blank space between paragraphs does not appear on thenormal editing screen, but you can see it with View Document.andP;  (p.andP;  563)andM;10 Fine-Tuning Space BetweenandM;LinesandM;To make text more readable, increase the space WordPerfect adds betweenlines.andP;  Follow the procedure for double-spacing between paragraphs, but type2p--the p must be lowercase--at the Primary prompt.andP;  This adds two points ofleading to each line within a paragraph.andP;  (A point is 1/72-inch.andP;  See theresults with View Document.andP;  (pp.andP;  563-564)andM;11 Dormant Hard ReturnsandM;Whenever a hard carriage return appears by itself at the top of a pagebeginning with a soft page break, Version 5.1 converts the hard return into adormant hard return so that an unwanted blank line doesn't appear at the topof the page.andP;  Later, if added text changes the position of the dormant hardreturn, it reverts to a normal hard return.andP;  This is automatic, but you needto be aware of it so that you don't think a hard return is missing and addone you don't actually need.andP;  (p.andP;  605)andM;12 Changing Fonts inandM;HeadersandM;You can change the base font in headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes, andgraphics captions screens without affecting text in the rest of the document.andO;(pp.andP;  223-224)andM;13 Placing EndnotesandM;You can indicate an endnote at any location in a document by using Footnote(Ctrl-F7), Endnote Placement (3).andP;  (p.andP;  230)andM;14 Cross-ReferencingandM;If a reference is located in a graphics box caption, header, or footer, youcan't mark both the reference and target in a single operation.andP;  You mustmark the reference and target separately.andP;  (pp.andP;  102-107)andM;15 Avoiding ClashesandM;Between Page Numbers andandM;Headers or FootersandM;When you create headers or footers, be careful to format them so that theydon't overlap with page numbers.andP;  Here are some ways to keep headers,footers, and page numbers from getting in one another's way: (1) Add an extrablank line at the top of each header or the bottom of each footer.andP;  (2) Leaveblank space in single-line headers and footers where the page number willprint.andP;  (3) Adjust page number position on the Page Number Position menu:Format (Shift-F8), Page (2), Number (6), Page Number Position (4).andP;  (p.andP;  298)andM;Editing TextandM;16 Recovering Text BlocksandM;If you highlight a block, choose Move (Ctrl-F4), and press F1 to cancel theMove, you can still change your mind and retrieve the block.andP;  Press Move(Ctrl-F4), Retrieve (4), Block (1).andP;  You can also retrieve it by pressingRetrieve (Shift-F10), Enter.andP;  (pp.andP;  483-484)andM;17 Wildcard Word SearchesandM;To insert a wildcard character into a search string, press Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X.andO;The resulting andless;X character matches any one character but not function codes.andO;andless;X cannot be the first character in a search string, but you can precede itwith a space to search for wildcards in the first letter positions of a word.andO;For example, a space followed by andless;Xandless;Xace finds place and trace.andP;  To searchfor a soft page code--[SPg]--press Ctrl-V, Ctrl-K in the search string.andP;  Toinclude a Soft Return code--[SRt]--in a search string, press Ctrl-M.andP;  (p.andO;600)andM;ColumnsandM;18 Using NewspaperandM;ColumnsandM;Move (Ctrl-F4) works within a single column to cut or copy a sentence, butyou must use Block (Alt-F4) with Move to transport an entire column of text.andO;Block a column, press Move (Ctrl-F4), choose Block (1), then select a Moveoption.andM;You can create columns in headers, graphics text boxes, and endnotes, but youcan't create columns in tables or put tables in columns.andP;  (But you can puttables in boxes and text boxes in columns.)andP;  (pp.andP;  78-80)andM;19 Using Parallel ColumnsandM;To create parallel columns in the middle of a document, enter your ColumnDefine, Column On, and Column Off codes.andP;  This will prevent the rest of thedocument from being reformatted in parallel column format.andP;  Move the cursorbetween the [Col On] and [Col Off] codes to start typing the parallelcolumns.andP;  (pp.andP;  80-85)andM;Tab SettingsandM;20 Tab MovementsandM;To move from tab to tab without inserting tabs, turn Insert off.andP;  If you arein the Typeover mode, pressing the tab key does not insert a tab unlessyou're already at the end of a line.andP;  This is particularly handy if you wantto edit a chart that has been formatted with tab settings.andP;  (p.andP;  684)andM;21 Moving Tab SettingsandM;When editing the tab ruler, slide existing tabs to the right or left byplacing the cursor on the tab you want to move and holding down Ctrl as youpress the left or right arrow keys.andP;  To move the cursor between existingtabs, press the up and down arrow keys.andP;  (pp.andP;  688-689)andM;22 Setting Decimal TabsandM;To set tabs at decimal line positions (for example, at .5 inch), remember tostart the number with a zero; otherwise, WordPerfect inserts a dot leader tabat the cursor position on the tab ruler.andP;  (p.andP;  690)andM;23 Tabs for ColumnsandM;Relative tabs are a godsend for editing newspaper and parallel columns.andO;Press Format (Shift-F8), Line (1), Tab Set (8), Type, Relative to Margin (2).andO;Tabs that follow that code will be measured from the left margin of eachcolumn, allowing you to create uniform paragraph indents without tab settingsfor each column.andP;  (p.andP;  691)andM;24 Hard TabsandM;WordPerfect has four types of tabs that align text either to the left or tothe right, center the text on the tab, or align the text with a decimalpoint.andP;  You can insert a Hard Tab--one that doesn't change its type ofalignment if you change the tab settings.andM;To insert a Hard Tab over the next tab stop while in the normal editingscreen, press Home, Tab.andP;  This tab will not change its type (left-aligned)regardless of how you subsequently edit the tab ruler.andP;  If you want to createhard-centered, flush-right, or decimal-aligned tabs, press Home, then Center(Shift-F6), Flush Right (Alt-F6), or Tab Align (Ctrl-F6), respectively.andP;  (p.andO;692)andM;TablesandM;25 Creating Tables in ColumnsandM;Tables are one of the more helpful new features in WordPerfect 5.1.andP;  Theyallow you to create organized rows and columns of tabular data without usingtab settings.andP;  Tables cannot be included in columns or placed side by sideunless you put them in graphics boxes.andP;  (p.andP;  697)andM;26 Including Graphics in TablesandM;You  can create graphics boxes in tables if the table itself is not in agraphics box.andP;  Text in the table can be made to wrap around the graphic, butyou may need to turn off table lines to prevent them from printing over thegraphic.andP;  (pp.andP;  700-701)andM;27 Protecting Tables fromandM;Page BreaksandM;A table that spans a page break is split and continued on the next page.andP;  Toprotect the table from being broken, use Block Protect.andP;  Block the table,then press Format (Shift-F8) and type Y at the prompt.andM;If you want to allow tables to be split, you can tell WordPerfect to repeatthe first few lines of the table at the top of the table section that fallson a new page.andP;  At the Table Edit menu, press Header (4) and enter the numberof rows you want to make up the header.andP;  (p.andP;  702)andM;28 Using Tables Instead ofandM;Parallel ColumnsandM;Creating parallel columns with the Table feature is easier than using theolder Parallel Columns method.andP;  The onscreen table borders will help you keeptrack of columnar material.andP;  (pp.andP;  702-703)andM;29 Deleting Table TextandM;To delete the text in a block of cells without deleting the table structurewhen working in the Table Edit menu, block the text, then press Backspace andY for Yes.andP;  Pressing Ctrl-End deletes all of the text on a table row from thecursor forward.andP;  (p.andP;  709)andM;30 Joining Two TablesandM;If you want to create a single table whose top and bottom halves are quitedifferent in structure, you'll probably find it easier to crete two separatetables.andP;  Create the second table immediately following the first, and use theLines option on the Table Edit menu to change line appearance as necessary tomake the two tables appear as one.andP;  (p.andP;  714)andM;31 Protecting Charts fromandM;ChangesandM;To prevent anyone from editing information in a chart, create the chart as atable and then lock the cells or columns you want to protect.andP;  SelectColumns/Tables (Alt-F7), Tables (2), Edit (2), Format (2), Cell (1) or Column(2), Lock (5), and Lock On (1).andP;  Lock is also useful for preventing dataentry personnel from accidentally making changes to the contents of headingsin forms.andP;  (pp.andP;  719-720)andM;FILES andamp; DIRECTORIESandM;Handling FilesandM;32 Converting Version 4.2andM;FilesandM;A bug in the Retrieve feature sometimes prevents WordPerfect 5.1 from readingVersion 4.2 files into 5.1 format.andP;  If you've upgraded to Version 5.1 from4.2, the Convert program provides a bug-free alternative.andP;  (pp.andP;  91-92, 97)andM;3andamp; Sending Formatted FilesandM;on E-MailandM;You can send and receive WordPerfect files by modem--either by directconnection or via commercial e-mail services such as MCI Mail--without losingformatting codes.andP;  First convert the files to the seven-bit transfer formatwith the Convert program.andP;  The file recipient can use Convert to restore theWordPerfect format.andP;  (pp.andP;  91-92, 98-99)andM;34 Retrieving ASCII FilesandM;The List Files screen in WordPerfect 5.1 replaces the Text In/Out option ofolder versions with a feature that converts DOS text files (ASCII) toWordPerfect format when you select Retrieve (1).andP;  Hard return codes areinserted at the ends of lines; to reduce reformatting chores with importedDOS files, set a wide hyphenation zone, then from a blank screen press TextIn/Out (Ctrl-F5), DOS Text (1), Retrieve (CR/LF to [SRt] in HZone) (3).andP;  Thengive the name of the file you want to retrieve.andP;  (p.andP;  386)andM;35 Retrieving ASCII FilesandM;from the List Files ScreenandM;To quickly retrive a DOS text file from the List Files screen, position thecursor over the file you want to retrieve and press Text In/Out (Ctrl-F5).andO;The file will be retrieved so that a hard return is at the end of each line.andO;This method works only with Short Display mode because non-WordPerfect filesare not listed if you display long filenames.andP;  (p.andP;  388)andM;36 Adding Up File SizesandM;Ever need a quick way to add up the total size of several files in asubdirectory?andP;  Go to the List Files screen (F5), and mark each file by movingthe cursor to it and pressing the asterisk key.andP;  The &quot;Used:&quot; prompt at thetop of the screen will display the total number of bytes in the files.andP;  (p.andO;387)andM;37 Marking and DeletingandM;FilesandM;In the List Files screen, you can mark all the displayed files at once bypressing Home and then * or by pressing Mark Text (Alt-F5).andP;  And you candelete all marked files by pressing Del, as weel as by selecting Delete (2)on the List Files menu (F5).andP;  (p.andP;  119)andM;38 Deleting Document SummariesandM;The only way you can delete as file's document summary is to press Del, thentype Y for Yes while the cursor is on the status line in the Document Summarymenu--Shift-F8, Document (3), Summary (5).andP;  (p.andP;  155).andM;39 Finding Files with WildcardsandM;When searching files with the Find function on the List Files screen, becareful how you format search terms.andP;  To find the phrase replace disk,enclose it in quotes and include a space at the end: &quot;replace disk&quot;.andP;  Tosearch for files that also contain phrases such as replace diskette, omit thespace: &quot;replace disk&quot;.andP;  To search for phrases that start with replace and endwith disk plus any other characters (such as replace the printer filediskette), include an asterisk wildcard, as in &quot;replace*disk&quot;.andP;  (p.andP;  216)andM;40 Finding Files with LogicalandM;OperatorsandM;You can use logical operators to look for files that contain combinations ofterms.andP;  A semicolorn or space selects files that contain both words.andO;(&quot;John;Mary&quot; finds files that contain both John and Mary, for example.)andP;  Acomma (&quot;John,Mary&quot;) selects files that contain either word.andP;  A hyphen locatesfiles that contain only the first term (&quot;John-Mary&quot; selects files thatcontain John but not Mary).andP;  (p.andP;  217)andM;41 Finding Files with SearchandM;KeyandM;With Version 5.1, you can use Search (f2) and Reverse Search (Shift-F2) tolocate files in the List Files screen.andP;  You can search for terms contained ina long filename, DOS filename, file type, or subdirectory name.andM;Also, Search and Reverse Search let you hunt for terms in text displayed withthe Look function in List Files.andP;  (p.andP;  217)andM;42 Reversing File SearchesandM;When using Find to look through files on the List Files screen, you canredisplay the last three file lists with the Undo command (6) on the Findmenu.andP;  This is a handy way to back up when you mistakenly choose the wrongterm to narrow a search and want to try again without starting from scratch.andO;(p.andP;  218)andM;43 Finding Files by DatesandM;When you search WordPerfect document summaries with the Find command on theList Files menu, remember that the Creation Date field gives the date thesummary was created, which is not necessarily the creation date of thedocument.andP;  To search for files edited on or between certain dates, select theRevision Date filed on the Conditions screen.andP;  (p.andP;  219)andM;44 Looking at FilesandM;Version 5.1 makes several changes in the Look command used to inspectdocuments from the List Files screen without retrieving them.andP;  If you havesaved a file with more information in a summary than just the filename andfile type, Look (6) will first display only the summary.andP;  To see the text ofthe document, press 3, L, or the down arrow key.andP;  If you are Looking at thetext, you can scroll up and down a screen by using the + and - keys on thecursor keypad.andP;  Contrary to what is stated in the manual, PgUp and PgDn willnot scroll through the text; instead, they will take you to a Look at thepreceding or following file, respectively, on the List Files screen.andP;  If youpress S while Looking at text, the file will scroll continuously until youpress any key.andP;  (pp.andP;  399-400)andM;45 Cataloging SummariesandM;A bug in early copies of Version 5.1 limits the use of the Save to File (5)function, which is displayed as an option while Looking at Summaries from theList Files Screen.andP;  If you have already saved one summary to a file, usingthe function a second time will produce the error message &quot;File not found.&quot;andO;Rename the file under which you saved a previous summary each time before youuse the Save to File function again.andM;An interim release of Version 5.1 dated 1/19/90 fixes the problem.andP;  Order anupdate by calling WordPerfect at 800-321-4566.andM;Handling DirectoriesandM;46 Moving to SubdirectoriesandM;With the List Files screen displayed, move the cursor quickly to asubdirectory name by pressing Name Search (6) and a / or \ and typing thedirectory name.andP;  (p.andP;  385)andM;47 Displaying an AlternateandM;DirectoryandM;When in List Files, you can display another directory without logging on toit.andP;  Press List (F5) and, at the prompt, enter the name of the directory.andO;With Version 5.1 you can specify which files are displayed by modifying the*.* wildcards that are displayed with the name of the directory.andP;  (p.andP;  387)andM;48 Long Names for DirectoriesandM;If you're using the new long filenames option, you can assign long filenames(aliases) to directories as well as to files.andP;  The procedure is different,however, from assigning long names to files.andM;On a blank editing screen, type the current name of the directory that youwant to rename (for example, C:\WP51\BLETTERS) and press End Field (F9).andO;Type the long directory name (for example, BILLING NOTICES), and press F9again.andP;  Then press Merge Codes (Shift-F9) and End Record (2).andP;  Repeat thesesteps for each long directory name that you want to display in the List Filesscreen.andP;  (Only the first 30 characters of each long name will be displayed.)andO;Finally, save the file containing all the new long names with the nameC:\WP{WP}.DLN.andP;  The file must be saved in the root directory of the driveyou're working with.andP;  If you're running Word-Perfect from floppy disks, enterthe letter of the disk drive you normally start DOS from.andP;  (pp.andP;  123-124)andM;DISPLAY andamp; PRINTINGandM;DisplayandM;49 Better Display of ColumnsandM;and TablesandM;If you do a lot of typing in columns, you may find it useful to change thedisplay pitch to a smaller font so that tightly spaced columns don't overlaponscreen.andP;  Press Format (Shift-F8), Document (3), Display Pitch (1), and Nfor No and enter a smaller display-pitch width.andM;You can also use Display Pitch to increase or decrease the amount of onscreenspace allotted to table cells.andP;  The setting affects only the width of thecells, not the amount of text that can fit in a cell.andP;  (p.andP;  128)andM;50 Faster Displays with ColumnsandM;While editing newspaper or parallel columns, you can accelerate screenrewrites greatly by first turning off side-by-side column display with Setup(Shift-F1), Display (2), Edit-Screen Options (6), Side-by-Side Display (7), Nfor No, and Exit (F7).andP;  Then turn off automatic reformatting--Shift-F1,Display (2), Edit-Screen Options (6), Automatically Format (1), N for No, andExit (F7).andM;You may want to write a macro that enters these keystrokes for you, becausethe automatic text formatting option is more natural when you aren't editingcolumns.andP;  (p.andP;  74)andM;51 Adjusting Reveal CodesandM;ScreenandM;To adjust the size of the Reveal Codes screen while working in it, pressScreen (Ctrl-F3) and (1) or W to select a window.andP;  Then enter the number oflines for the normal editing screen.andP;  For example, entering 1 expands theReveal Codes screen to 19 lines.andP;  You can also change the size of the RevealCodes screen permanently in Setup (Shift-F1).andP;  (p.andP;  608)andM;52 Looking at Long LinesandM;While using Look (from the List Files screen) to view a document that's widerthan the screen, press End to alternate between showing its right and leftends.andP;  (p.andP;  399)andM;PrintingandM;53 Printing Extended CharactersandM;You can now print any of WordPerfect's more than 1,500 extended characters onany graphics printer supported by WordPerfect (there are more than 500).andO;This lends new usefulness to the Compose feature.andP;  You may never need aGerman umlaut, but how about dots (bullets) or copyright and trademarksymbols?andP;  To use Compose, press Ctrl-2 or Ctrl-V, enter the numbers of thecharacter set and desired character separated by a comma, and press Enter.andO;(The character sets are shown in Appendix P, on page 977, and in the fileCHARACTR.DOC supplied on disk.andP;  Also, check out the list of availabledigraphs and diacriticals.andP;  (pp.andP;  87-88)andM;54 Printing LabelsandM;If you're merge-printing with the new Labels feature, you must place a PaperSize/Type code in the primary file with Document Initial Codes--Shift-F8, 3,2.andP;  If WorldPerfect balks at accepting the Paper Size/Type spec you give it,try setting the left, right, top, and bottom page margins--not the labelmargins--to 0&quot; before entering the Paper Size/Type code.andM;A macro supplied with WordPerfect 5.1, LABELS.WPM, will step you through theprocess of creating and inserting the Paper Size/Type code in your document.andO;To run this macro, press Macro (Alt-F10), type LABELS, and press Enter.andP;  (Youmust have installed the macro and keyboard files in order to run this macro.)andO;(pp.andP;  350-353)andM;55 Printing SummariesandM;To print just the Document Summary for a document on disk, press Print(Shift-F7), press Document on Disk (3), type a filename, type S when promptedto enter the pages, and press Enter.andP;  To print the summary and selectedpages, type S, a comma, and the selected pages.andP;  To print the entiredocument, including the summary, type S-.andM;To print the summary for a document onscreen, press Print (Shift-F7),Multiple Pages (5), and S.andP;  The summary and selected pages for the documentor the entire document can be chosen from Multiple Pages with the sameselections as printing from a Document on Disk.andP;  (p.andP;  536)andM;56 Changing SummaryandM;PromptsandM;If you use document summaries, you may want to print summaries using prompttitles different from the WordPerfect defaults (for example, &quot;RBS Co.andP;  ClientAccount:&quot; instead of &quot;Account:).andP;  Retrieve the file named WP.LRS and useSearch to find the entry for the package language you are using (&quot;US&quot; forUnited States, &quot;UK&quot; for United Kingdom; page 361 contains a complete list).andO;Then look a few lines below that for the first field in the document summary,&quot;Document Name:&quot;.andP;  The edited prompts will not appear in the document summaryediting screen but will be used to print summaries.andP;  (pp.andP;  367-368)andM;57 Connecting VerticalandM;LinesandM;If vertical lines created with Line Draw don't connect when you print them,set line height to .125&quot; (8 lines per inch).andP;  Press Format (Shift-F8), Line(1), Height (4), and Fixed (2), type .125&quot;, and hit Exit (F7) twice.andP;  (p.andO;370)andM;58 Adjusting BaselinesandM;WordPerfect normally places the first text baseline on a page just below thetop margin so that the tops of letters on that line just touch the topmargin.andP;  (The baseline is the imaginary line that runs under the base ofletters, such as a and x, that don't contain descenders, as p and y do.)andM;But changing a font on that line causes the baseline to vary.andP;  To be utterlyprecise about placing text on the page, set the Baseline Placement forTypesetters option to Yes.andP;  Press Format (Shift-F8), Other (4), PrinterFunctions (6), Baseline Placement (5), Y for Yes, Exit (F7).andM;It's important to do this if you want to use Advance to place text in aprecise position on the page.andP;  Once you set this option to Yes, you must setLine Height to Fixed; press Format (Shift-F8), Line (1), Line Height (4), andFixed (2), type a line height, and press Exit (F7).andP;  (p.andP;  561)andM;59 Faster PrintingandM;When printing graphics or downloading soft fonts, you can dramaticallyincrease printing speed by remaining in the Printer Control screen until adocument finishes printing or by not selecting any editing features while atthe document screen.andP;  (p.andP;  579)andM;60 Changing Appearance ofandM;Graphics CharactersandM;You can change the appearance of WordPerfect's extended character set.andP;  (Theextended characters are alphabets such as Hebrew and symbols such astrademarks and copyrights that WordPerfect can print as graphics.)andP;  To changetheir look, switch fonts just before you select the characters.andM;WordPerfect prints extended characters by attempting to emulate the font thatyou're currently using, but it uses just three fonts for this emulation:Courier, Helvetica, and Times Roman.andP;  If you don't like the appearance ofextended characters in one font, try switching to one of the other two.andP;  (pp.andO;582-583)andM;61 Printing to DiskandM;If you want someone who doesn't have WordPerfect to be able to print yourfiles, choose the Print to Disk option.andP;  Press Print (Shift-F7); select aprinter; press Edit (3), Port (2), and Other (8); type a filename; and pressExit (F7) twice.andP;  If the recipient has trouble printing the file with the DOSPRINT or COPY command (if, for example, printing ends prematurely, graphicsdon't print correctly, or garbage characters appear), tell him to use theCOPY command with the /B switch--for example: COPY filename PRN /B (pp.andO;588-589)andM;Mail-MergeandM;62 Faster Mail-MergeandM;When merge-printing a primary file that requires several formatting codes atthe beginning of the document, put the codes in Initial Codes on the FormatDocument menu--Shift-F8, Document (3), Initial Codes (2).andP;  If you insert themin the document itself, the codes will be added to each copy of the mergeddocument, wasting disk space and slowing the merge process.andP;  (pp.andP;  320-321)andM;63 Displaying FilesandM;When you start a merge and you're prompted for the name of a primary orsecondary file, press List (F5) to display the files in a directory.andP;  Movethe cursor to the file you want and press Retrieve (1) to select it andcontinue the merge.andP;  (p.andP;  463)andM;64 Merging with GraphicsandM;If your merge files contain graphics, you can use the Graphic on Disk featureto save disk space and speed up the merge operation.andP;  (pp.andP;  261-262, 466)andM;TOOLSandM;EquationsandM;65 Aligning EquationsandM;To change the alignment settings for a single equation in a document thatcontains several, go into the Equation Editor editing window by pressingGraphics (Alt-F9), Equations (6), Create (1), Edit (9).andP;  Then press EquationSetup (Shift-F1) and either Horizontal Alignment (3) or Vertical Alignment(4), and select the alignment option of your choice.andP;  (pp.andP;  179-180)andM;66 Changing Equation SizeandM;To change the size of an equation, change the size of the base font justbefore the equation box code.andP;  Press Font (Ctrl-F8) and Base Font (3), selecta font from the menu, and press Exit (F7).andP;  After you've created yourequation, reselect the font you're using for the rest of the document.andP;  (p.andO;181)andM;67 Changing Font SizeandM;You have two choices for selecting the font size for equation symbols: youcan set a specific size, or you can have WordPerfect choose a size for you.andO;To change the font size permanently, use the Equation options menu in Setup.andO;Press Shift-F1, Initial Settings (4), Equations (3), Graphic Font Size (2),and Set Point (2) and specify a point size.andP;  To change the font sizetemporarily, enter the editing window of the Equation Editor and follow thesame steps.andP;  (pp.andP;  181-183)andM;68 Grouping Equation ElementsandM;To have a multipart equation segment act as a single unit, surround thesegment with curly braces.andP;  For example, x raised to the power of negative 2must be grouped as follows: x[andless;][%-2}.andP;  If you omit the braces, the minussign will be superscripted but the 2 will be displayed and printed on thebaseline with the x.andM;Here's another subtle but essential trick: when you type function names fromthe keyboard instead of selecting them from the function palette, you mustseparate them from surrounding items with a symbol, a space, or Enter.andP;  Forexample, the following equation uses the grave accent as a separator: cos[andless;]2'ital theta' + 'sin[andless;]2' ital theta '=' 1.andP;  (pp.andP;  189-191)andM;69 Italicizing Greek LettersandM;When you select Greek letters from the function palette, they are notitalicized.andP;  To create italicized Greek characters, enter them from thekeyboard using the ital function--for example, ital sigma.andM;The equation editor treats certain words as functions and italicizes them(sine, cosine, and so on).andP;  To display and print these characters in thenormal font, precede them with Func; for example, Func arctan.andP;  To apply Functo more than one variable, enclose the group in curly braces; for example,Func[{cosine theta}[.andP;  (p.andP;  202)andM;70 Initial SettingsandM;If you do a lot of work with equations, you may find it handy to learn anduse a keyboard layout of your own design or the special Equations layoutsupplied with WordPerfect.andP;  Rather than repeat the keystrokes required toswitch to that keyboard each time you create an equation, you can tellWordPerfect to make that keyboard active whenever you enter the equationediting screen.andP;  Press Setup (Shift-F1), Initial Settings (4), Equations (3),and Keyboard (5), move the cursor to the name of the desired keyboard, andpress Exit (F7) twice to return to the normal editing screen.andP;  (p.andP;  323)andM;Graphics andandM;Line DrawingandM;71 Box TypesandM;Confused by graphics box types?andP;  The five types of graphics boxes (Figure,Table, Text, User, and Equation) have three differences: (1) Each belongs toa separately numbered list.andP;  (2) Each has different default options on theGraphics Options menu (for example, border style and numbering method).andP;  (3)Equation boxes have different Caption Position choices.andP;  Otherwise, all theboxes are functionally the same.andM;You can retrieve graphic images, text, or equations into any of the box typesor leave a box empty.andP;  The box type does not refer to the contents of the boxbut to which of the independent lists of graphics boxes it belongs.andM;If you're creating or editing a graphics box and need to change the box type,press Graphics (Alt-F9) in the box definition menu and choose the type of boxyou want.andP;  (p.andP;  255)andM;72 Locking Boxes to TextandM;If you want a graphics box to stay with text that may be moved, use aparagraph box and Block Protect.andP;  If the paragraph falls too close to thebottom of the page for the box to fit on the page, the box moves to the topof the next page (or column).andP;  But the text of the paragraph containing thebox does not move with it.andM;When the box moves to the next page, text that followed it is moved above itto fill the empty space on the preceding page.andP;  To make sure a graphics boxstays with its surrounding text, use Block Protect: block the desired textand graphics box and press Format (Shift-F8) and Y for Yes.andP;  (p.andP;  259)andM;73 Numbering CaptionsandM;When creating a caption for a graphics box, you may accept the defaultcaption number that WordPerfect enters in the caption-editing screen, or youmay choose not to have your captions numbered by deleting the number withBackspace.andP;  To reinsert the number, press Graphics (Alt-F9) in thecaption-editing screen.andP;  (pp.andP;  259-260)andM;74 Using Graphics BoxesandM;with StylesandM;There's only one way to place a box containing a graphics image in astylesheet.andP;  At the Definition menu, choose Contents (2), Graphic on Disk (2)to save graphics information in a separate file instead of with the currentdocument.andP;  This is useful for styles that contain a company logo, forexample.andP;  It also lets you use the same graphic more than once in a documentwithout having to save it each time and use up file space.andP;  (p.andP;  261)andM;75 Tight-Fitting Text BoxesandM;To place a single-line box tightly around text--as in a chapter heading, forexample--choose the Size (7) option on the Definition menu and then pick AutoBoth (4).andP;  If there's more than one line of text, the width returns to thedefault value; to make box borders fit tightly around the box, you must editthe default size on the Text Box Options menu--Alt-F9, Text Box (3), Options(4).andP;  (p.andP;  265)andM;76 Putting a Border on aandM;PageandM;To place a border around an entire page (for example, for a newsletter),choose Page for the Anchor Type on the Graphics Definition menu, then selectVertical Position and Full Page.andP;  The graphics box will fill the page areawithin the top and bottom margins.andP;  (p.andP;  266)andM;77 Superimposing BoxesandM;To superimpose one graphics box on top of another or to print text on top ofa graphics image, turn off Wrap text Around Box.andP;  (Type N for No at theGraphics Definition menu.)andP;  With a little experimentation, you can fine-tunethe desired image by using advance (Shift-F8), Other (4), Advance (1)together with View Document--Print (Shift-F7), View (6).andP;  Note that with thisoption set to No, the box outline isn't shown in the normal editing screen.andM;When Setting Wrap Text Around Box to No for a box with a Paragraph anchortype, be careful; if there isn't enough room for the whole image on thecurrent page, only the part that fits on the page will be printed.andP;  (pp.andO;267-268)andM;78 Rotating GraphicsandM;When you rotate an image by a given number of degrees, it is rotated from thestarting point, not from a previously rotated position.andP;  For example, if youenter 90 degrees, and then enter 90 again, you still rotate the image only 90degrees; to rotate by 180 degrees, you must select 180.andP;  (pp.andP;  271-272)andM;79 Rotating TextandM;If you are creating or editing text inside a graphics box with the Contentsoption on the Definition menu set to Text, choosing Edit (9) displays a blankediting screen where you can enter text and/or WordPerfect codes you wantplaced inside the box.andP;  If your printer can rotate fonts, you can rotate thetext.andP;  Press Graphics (Alt-F9) to exit the editing screen; then choose fromthe displayed menu the number of degrees you want to rotate the text (90,1980, or 270).andP;  (p.andP;  273)andM;80 Placing Graphic LinesandM;To position a horizontal graphics line flush left at a tab stop, press Indent(F4) to move the cursor to the desired tab, then press Graphics (Alt-F9),Line (5), Create Horizontal (1), Horizontal Position (1), and Left (1).andP;  (Themanual describes similar options for placing lines flush right, centered, orat a user-defined position.)andP;  (pp.andP;  281-282)andM;81 Controlling Line HeightandM;Puzzled by horizontal lines that seem to change height randomly?andP;  When aHorizontal Line code--[HLine]--is the only entry on a line, line height isdetermined by the line's width; but if codes or text (even a space) arelocated on the same line, line height is determined by the font and pointsize currently in use.andP;  To ensure uniform line height, check each horizontalline in the Reveal Codes screen (Alt-F3) and remove any stray characters.andO;(p.andP;  283)andM;82 Floating BoxesandM;When you create a paragraph-type graphics box and set a value for MinimumOffset from Paragraph on the Box Options menu--press Alt-F9, select a boxtype, select Options (4)--WordPerfect tries to keep the box the specifieddistance from the top of the paragraph.andP;  If the paragraph moves too close tothe bottom of the page, WordPerfect overrides the offset value and begins tomove the box higher in the paragraph.andP;  When the offset cannot be furtherreduced, the box is bumped to the top of the next page (or column).andP;  To haveWordPerfect honor the offset value no matter how close the text is to thebottom of the page, set the minimum offset to a very large value (forexample, 11 inches on an 11-inch page).andP;  (p.andP;  288)andM;83 Quick Line DrawingandM;To draw lines of known length quickly while in the Line Draw mode, press theEsc key, type the number of draw characters desired, and press theappropriate arrow key.andP;  To quickly draw a horizontal line to either margin,press home and then the left or right arrow key.andP;  (p.andP;  371)andM;MacrosandM;84 Avoiding Keyboard-LayoutandM;ChangesandM;If you're using a keyboard layout that reassigns an Alt-key combination thatyou've previously assigned to a macro, you may want to run that macro withoutswitching keyboards.andP;  Press macro (Alt-F10), type the name of the macro (forexample, ALTB), and press Enter.andP;  (pp.andP;  334-335)andM;85 Matching Macros to KeyboardandM;LayoutsandM;If you've assigned a macro to a key with Keyboard Layout and you subsequentlyedit the macro with the WordPerfect macro editor, your changes will not bereflected in the keyboard layout unless you retrieve the macro to the keyagain.andP;  Press Setup (Shift-F1) and Keyboard Layout (5), move the cursor tothe name of the keyboard layout that contains the key, and press Edit (7),Retrieve (7), and the key to which you want to reassign the macro.andP;  Then typethe name of the macro or press its Alt-key combination and press Exit (F7)until you're back to the normal editing screen.andP;  (p.andP;  341)andM;86 Chaining and NestingandM;While recording a macro, you can chain an Alt-letter macro so that it startsafter the current macro finishes.andP;  To chain macros A and B, while recording Apress Macro (Alt-F10), then the Alt-letter keystroke fro macro B.andM;To  nest an Alt-letter macro, simply press its Alt-letter combination at thepoint where you want it to run.andP;  Unlike chained macros, nested macros runimmediately rather than at the completion of the first macro.andP;  (pp.andP;  409-410,414)andM;87 Converting 4.2 MacrosandM;If you created very large macros with WordPerfect 4.2, they may not fit inthe WordPerfect 5.1 macro editor.andP;  The macro conversion program supplied withWordPerfect can break these long macros and chain them together for you.andP;  (Ifthey contain subroutines, they almost certainly will not run properly, butyou may be able to edit the smaller macros so that they'll work.)andP;  To breakand chain a 4.2 macro, type MACROCNV and the filename of the macro to beconverted.andP;  To break and chain long 5.0 or 5.1 macros, type MACROCNV /M andthe filename.andP;  (pp.andP;  404-408)andM;88 Creating a Macro ThatandM;Runs Other MacroandM;To expand (without limit) the number of Alt-letter macros you can use, createa series of master macros that run specialized macros stored in their ownsubdirectories.andP;  Press Macro Def (Ctrl-F10), type the name of a master macro(for example, Alt-M), and press Enter.andP;  Press Macro (Alt-F10) and type thename of a subdirectory where you'll store a set of specialized macros; forexample, C:\WP51\DOCMACS\ATL.andP;  Press Ctrl-PgUp, Pause (1), Enter to insert apause during macro playback, then press Enter and Ctrl-F10 to end macrorecording.andP;  When you press the master key, WordPerfect will display the macrosubdirectory spec and wait for you to type the Alt-letter of a macro in thesubdirectory.andP;  Type the key and press Enter to run the macro.andP;  (p.andP;  414)andM;89 Creating with the MacroandM;EditorandM;Before you could get into the macro editor in WordPerfect 5.0, you had tocreate a blank dummy macro.andP;  That's no longer necessary.andP;  To enter themacro-editing screen, press Home and Ctrl-F10 and type a macro namee anddescription.andP;  If the macro already exists, it'll be retrieved into the macroeditor; otherwise, you'll enter an empty macro-editing screen.andP;  (p.andP;  417)andM;90 Mistakes in the ManualandM;The manual mistakenly says that while in the macro editor, you can pressEscape or Ctrl-PgUp to mvoe to the macro commands list.andP;  In actuality, onlyCtrl-PgUp works.andP;  And the manual says that name search, which allows you tofind a specific command from the list of commands, is automatically activewhile you're in the Macro Commands menu.andP;  Actually, you must press Search(F2) to activate the name search feature.andP;  (p.andP;  419)andM;91 Positioning MessagesandM;While positioning the cursor with Ctrl-P commands in the macro editor, youcan't access row 0 or column 0 in the normal way, which is to useCtrl-letters that correspond to the numbers 1 through 26.andP;  Because there arejust 26 letters in the alphabet, WordPerfect has no Ctrl-letter to correspondto 0.andP;  Instead, you must use ASCII 254, which you create by holding down theAlt key as you tap out 254 on the numeric keypad.andP;  For example, to  positionthe cursor at column 0, row 0, press Ctrl-P, then tap out Alt-254 twice.andM;Check out the useful menu templates on pages 428 and 429 and also the menucode included in several of the supplied macros, such as LABELS.WPM.andP;  (pp.andO;426-429)andM;92 Controlling MessageandM;DisplaysandM;You can create a clever &quot;stacking&quot; effect to display one macro message overthe previous one.andP;  Be sure there's a {DISPLAY OFF} code prior to the messageinstructions, and then use cursor positioning to overwrite the old messagewith a new one.andM;If you need to have {DISPLAY OFF} active but don't want to stack messages,use a andless;L cursor-positioning command following the first message or pressCtrl-F3 twice to clear a previous message.andM;To remove a message that remains onscreen after a macro finishes, insert thefollowing line at the end of the macro: {PROMPT} {DEL TO EOP}.andP;  To insert the{DEL to EOP} code, press Ctrl-L.andP;  (pp.andP;  429-431)andM;93 Typeover and InsertandM;Sometimes when you're creating a macro you want to be sure that Insert orTypeover is on.andP;  To turn on Insert, press Home, Home, Insert while definingthe macro; to turn on Typeover, press Home, Insert.andP;  (p.andP;  751)andM;94 Moving Around ParagraphsandM;WordPerfect has no commands for moving the cursor to the start or end of thecurrent paragraph.andP;  But you can create two simple macros to do so.andP;  In themacro editor, press Ctrl-PgUp to move to the macro commands list, move thecursor to the {Para Up} or {Para Down} command, press Enter, and press Exit(F7) to save the macro.andP;  (p.andP;  908)andM;MiscellaneousandM;95 KerningandM;Unhappy with WordPerfect's automatic kerning?andP;  You can adjust the kerning byinserting an Advance code between a pair of characters.andP;  Press Format(Shift-F8), Other (4), Advance (1), and Left (4) and enter the amount to theleft--i hundredths of an inch--that you want to move the second character.andO;(p.andP;  331)andM;96 Creating ListsandM;You can generate a list of captions from the figure, table, text, equation,or user-defined boxes in a document.andP;  Define a list to include one of thosecaption types.andP;  Lists 6 through 10 are preassigned to captions.andP;  (To adduser-defined text to these preassigned lisets as well, see page 390 of themanual.)andP;  You don't have to mark captions manually to generate these lists.andO;See the Lists Define section to learn how to create lists.andP;  (p.andP;  389)andM;97 using Look with WordPerfectandM;ShellandM;If you're running WordPerfect under WordPerfect Shell, you can block textdisplayed with the Look command in a List Files screen and save or append itto the Clipboard.andP;  You can then retrieve the blocked text into a WordPerfectdocument or other WordPerfect product.andP;  (p.andP;  398)andM;98 Avoiding Out-of-MemoryandM;MessagesandM;If you're getting frequent &quot;Not enough memory&quot; messages, check the 15 tricksfor freeing memory listed in the WordPerfect manual.andP;  A sampling: (1) Removememory-resident programs.andP;  (2) If you have a soft keyboard selected, pressCtrl-6 to unselect it.andP;  (3) Turn off hyphenation or choose Internal Rules asthe hyphenation type.andP;  (4) Don't print in the backgroeund.andP;  (5) Don't use amouse.andP;  (pp.andP;  456-457)andM;99 Mouse for Left-HandersandM;WordPerfect lets left-handers reverse the mouse buttons.andP;  Press Shift-F1(Setup), Mouse (1), Left-Handed Mouse (6), Exit (F7).andP;  (p.andP;  473)andM;100 Updating Initial CodesandM;To add your latest initial codes to old documents, create a new, dummydocument by saving a blank editing screen to a new filename.andP;  Then retrievethe old document into that screen and save it under the old document filenameby pressing Save (F10), giving the old filename, and pressing Enter and Y forYes.andP;  (p.andP;  602)andM;101 Updating the Spell-CheckerandM;Words you add to a personal dictionary will not be displayed as replacementsin the normal spell-checking screen until you compress the supplementaldictionary with the Speller Utility.andP;
