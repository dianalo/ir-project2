The Canadian-owned tanker Frank H. Brown struck Burnt IslandReef on Saturday night. The captain, who was not identified, blamedthe grounding on ``a judgment error,'' Coast Guard spokesman EdMoreth said.   The agency said it took blood and urine samples from crewmembers to test for drug or alcohol use.   The 400-foot ship was refloated at high tide Sunday andcontinued under its own power about 15 miles up a narrow channel toScow Bay, just south of Petersburg. There, divers found a 2-foothole in one of its tanks.   Lt. Brian Flory of the Coast Guard said the vessel remained atanchor overnight.   ``It has boom all around it,'' Flory said early today. ``Theremaining cargo was transferred out of the damaged tank. There's norecoverable gasoline anywhere.''   Coast Guard and state environmental officials said damage tofish and wildlife appeared to be minimal. The decision not to cleanup the spill was made Sunday as the gasoline quickly broke up intoseveral thin sheens, the largest a mile long.   ``It's just not recoverable,'' Moreth said. ``The stuff seems tobe evaporating quicker than anyone could pick it up, and it's onlyin small patches scattered around.''   The spill was a fraction of the size of the Exxon Valdezdisaster, in which nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oilspilled into Prince William Sound last March in the nation's worstoil spill. The Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, goes on trial nextweek.   The site of Saturday's spill is about 135 miles south of Juneauin a channel called Wrangell Narrows. The tanker carried 1.8million gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, but onlyone tank was ruptured.   ``It's not a heavy fuel, so it has a tendency to break up easilyand it weathers much faster than a heavier oil,'' Coast Guardspokesman Greg Robinson said.   The tanker is owned by White Pass Transportation Inc. ofVancouver, British Columbia. It was heading from Vancouver toSkagway, 210 miles north of Petersburg.   Wrangell Narrows is a windy, 25-mile long channel between SumnerStrait and Frederick Sound. It is one of the narrowest waterwaysbetween the thickly forested and mountainous islands that form theInside Passage.   An estimated 20,000 gallons of gasoline remained in the damagedtank and was removed Sunday night to a nearby barge at Scow Bay.Boom totaling 1,050 feet was placed around the two vessels tocontain any further leakage.   The vessel may be allowed to continue to Skagway with the restof its load today. The damage is not enough to affect the tanker'smaneuverability, Moreth said.   The spill was not expected to pose a health risk to peopleliving along the channel, said Barbara Holian, a spokeswoman forthe state Department of Environmental Conservation in Juneau. Shesaid spilled gasoline does not remain highly toxic for long becauseit evaporates quickly.   The state's Crystal Lake Hatchery 15 miles south of Petersburgwas not threatened by the spill, said fish culturist Bill Davidsonat the salmon hatchery. There are no fish runs in the area untilspring, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
