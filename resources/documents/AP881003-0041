Police are now the official arbiters of what's naughty and niceunder a new state law imposing fines and jail terms for motoristssporting bumper stickers authorities consider obscene.   Offenders face a second-degree misdemeanor arrest, six months injail and fines of up to $500.   And that's just for the first offense. Maximum fines and jailtimes could double the second time.   The law passed by state legislators this year went into effectSaturday.   Under the statute, a bumper sticker can be obscene if it appealsto lewd sexual interest, if it depicts sexual conduct in anobviously offensive way or if it lacks serious literary, artistic,political or scientific value.   ``It's one of the most unconstitutional laws ever passed,''American Civil Liberties Union member Jim Green said. ``It's atotal joke.''   Highway Patrol attorneys will issue interpretations of the lawbefore troopers enforce it, said Broward County State Attorney'sOffice spokesman Jack Freese.   ``I think most people want this law,'' Highway Patrol spokesmanMax Shell said. ``The average person does not want to seefour-letter words and stickers that allude to sex when they'redriving on the highway.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marty Rizzo is looking forward to anOlympics of his own, but he uses a comb and scissors instead of avaulting pole or javelin.   The 33-year-old Naperville man just missed representing theUnited States on the three-man national team in the WorldHairdressing Championships in Dusseldorf, West Germany, but plannedto enter the contest in the open competition today.   Rizzo spent $2,000 to go to Europe and train with the U.S. team,which he failed to make by finishing fourth. He feels the contestwill be good training for the 1990 championships in Tokyo.   Contests for hairdressers involve speed and technique. Dependingon the category, competitors have 15 to 50 minutes to finish theirwork on the heads of models, and they try to sculpt unusual wavesand shapings.   Rizzo, who owns a salon, is a consultant to a hair stylingproducts manufacturer and gets $700 per appearance.   But the world champion can make $1,500 per appearance, he said,and others in the field say a gold medal could mean much more inendorsements and appearances.   His wife, Sue, 31, is looking forward to his winning top honorsin Tokyo and then retiring, Rizzo said.   ``She wants me to go and get it done with,'' he said. ``Shesays, `You've been in competition long enough. It's about time yougo out to stud.'''</TEXT></DOC>
