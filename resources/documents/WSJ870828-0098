Dumping lime in an acidifying lake in order to restore pH balance is a short-term, site-specific solution only. The policy of New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation -- the same as when I headed the agency a decade ago -- is to lime a small number of lakes that are intensively used for recreational fishing, or that have a special genetic stock of fish worth preserving.    Even on this limited basis, there is an environmental risk to liming. This is due to the tendency of acidified waters to leach toxic metals, such as aluminum, into the surrounding environment. Scientists believe that unless liming is done indefinitely, it will merely postpone the day when a larger accumulation of toxic metals is released -- with far greater harm to humans and wildlife.    This is especially important because &quot;Living Lakes,&quot; the organization that purports to offer state agencies help in dealing with acidifying lakes, will only commit to short-term liming. Once a lake's pH balance has been artificially restored, liming must be repeated every two to four years to prevent acidification and leaching.    Finally, the Journal's editorial ignores the fact that liming lakes will not protect forests from rapidly spreading damage caused by acid rain and other airborne pollutants. It will not protect man-made structures from major decay caused by acid rain/snow. Most important, it will not protect the lungs of children and elderly people from respiratory illness linked increasingly to the sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxides emissions that cause acid rain.    Liming lakes is not the solution to this problem. A cost-effective emissions-control program is the only way to stop the damage being wreaked on our environment by acid rain.    Peter A.A.
