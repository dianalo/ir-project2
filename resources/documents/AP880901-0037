According to Radio Cooperative of Santiago, 10 people wereinjured, one seriously, when pro- and anti-Pinochet demonstratorsclashed Wednesday in the city of Valdivia, about 500 miles south ofSantiago.   Police arrested 30 of the demonstrators, the radio said, quotinga local youth leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party.   In Santiago, students opposed to Pinochet protested Wednesday intwo small demonstrations broken up by police, who reported 19arrests and no injuries.   In a 20-minute address broadcast to the nation via radio andtelevision Wednesday night, Pinochet said he planned to forge a``new democracy'' offering economic progress and legal safeguardsagainst communism.   ``This ambitious challenge is not the task of only some,'' saidthe 72-year-old Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup.``Our democracy needs the collaboration of all Chileans.''   ``Our democracy ... will be enriched and improved bydisagreement and legitimate pluralism,'' he added.   The speech was Pinochet's first formal campaign address sincehis nomination Tuesday by fellow military commanders as the solecandidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. The selectionprompted street disturbances in which three people were killed, atleast 20 injured and more than 800 arrested.   ``The farce has been consumated,'' the president of the centristChristian Democratic Party, Patricio Aylwin, said Wednesday ofPinochet's nomination. ``As was foreseeable ... Pinochet imposedhis force and ambition.''   Members of a 16-party opposition coalition on Wednesday signedan accord calling for full democracy.   If Pinochet wins a majority of votes in the ballot, he willbegin a new eight-year term starting in March. If a majority of thecitizens vote ``no'' in the referendum, a multi-candidate electionwill be held in 1990, with Pinochet remaining in power until then.   If Pinochet loses, the referendum accord also calls for changesin a 1980 constitution drafted by the government, which grants themilitary strong supervisory powers over national policy.   Opposition leaders _ whom Pinochet has in the past denounced as``traitors,'' ``cowards'' and ``rats'' _ were considered highlyunlikely to heed his appeal for their support.   Many polls show Pinochet trailing the opposition in votersupport and the speech indicated plans to promote a conciliatoryimage in the campaign.   Pinochet spoke to Chileans _ whom he addressed as ``my dearfriends'' _ in the style of a fireside chat, with a framedphotograph of his wife on a wooden desk surrounded by a Chileanflag, a computer and books.   Even his supporters admit Pinochet suffers from a dictatorialimage after imposing fierce political repression following the coupthat brought him to power. He suspended many civil liberties andordered thousands of leftists arrested or expelled.   Hundreds of citizens were killed or disappeared after beingarrested by security forces, human rights groups say.   The coup toppled the elected government of President SalvadorAllende _ a self-declared Marxist _ and ended decades of democraticrule.   In his address, Pinochet said the coup saved Chile from becoming``a Marxist slave state.''</TEXT></DOC>
