Judge Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia said it would be at least aweek before Heber Jentzsch of Los Angeles sees a second judge aboutsetting bail.   He told reporters Jentzsch was being sent to Carabanchel Prisonoutside Madrid and said the legal process could take months or evenyears before it reaches trial.   Vazquez Honrubia said authorities had frozen $1.76 million inbank accounts belonging to officials of the U.S.-based Church ofScientology and the church's drug rehabilitation program, Narconon.   ``There is obvious and evident tax fraud here,'' the judge said.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bob Meade said Gerald Finn of Boston alsowas jailed pending further investigation and two other Americanswere awaiting expulsion.   Meade did not identify the two, but court records listed them asNancy Webcyk and William Tucker, believed to be husband and wife.   Edith Buchele, a West German residing in Los Angeles, said theorganization would sue the judge immediately ``because his ordersare illegal.''   She identified herself at a news conference earlier Wednesday aschief officer in the church's Office of Special Affairs.   Vazquez Honrubia ordered a police raid on an internationalmeeting in Madrid Sunday of members of the organization, following anine-month investigation into complaints by Spaniards that they hadbeen bilked.   The judge told reporters after questioning all 71 people arrestedin the raid that 11 were jailed pending further investigation orindictment; 10 were ordered expelled and 50 were released.   He held a news conference in a room in Madrid's 21st DistrictCourt filled with documents, computers and other equipmentconfiscated during raids Sunday on offices of the church andNarconon.   Spanish television showed Jentzsch, a former Hollywood actor,giving the V sign for victory in a court passageway during a breakin his questioning.   Other foreigners ordered expelled included two Britons, twoItalians, one French, one Swiss, one Swede and one Dane, theorganization's attorney in Spain, Jose Luis Chamorro, said.   Spain's Justice Ministry twice refused to grant the organizationlegal status as a religious entity.   ``Mr. Jentzsch has never been in Spain before, so how could hehave committed any crime,'' Ms. Buchele protested.   She said, ``He (the judge) has listed no facts so far, and he hasnot stated any crimes, either. The action ... has nothing to do withjustice but reminds us of the Spanish Inquisition.''   The Church of Scientology, founded in the mid-1950s by Americanscience fiction author and former U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard,has its European headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.   It has legal status in Britain and France and operates in otherEuropean countries.   The Narconon drug rehabilitation centers have come under attackby critics who complain of high fees and unorthodox programs.   ``One would assume the government would be interested in any formof drug rehabilitation and any group'' that tries to solve theproblem, Ms. Buchele said.   Heroin addiction is a serious problem in Spain, particularlyamong 18-to-25-year-olds, 45 percent of whom are unemployed andnever held a job.   Few officially sanctioned, medically supervised drugrehabilitation centers operate in the country.   ``The present attack can only come from those vested interestswho are making a lot of money out of drugs,'' Ms. Buchele charged.   Several lawsuits are pending in the United States against thechurch, involving its tax-exempt status and burglaries of offices ofthe Internal Revenue Service.   In Sweden, police are investigating 195 people who have defaultedon loans totalling about $10 million believed to have been taken outto finance Scientology courses.</TEXT></DOC>
