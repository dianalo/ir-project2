The businessman, Michael de Guzman, and retired Brig. Gen. JoseAlmonte, director of the Economic Intelligence and InvestigationBureau, testified on their scheme before a House of Representativescommittee.   They said their 1986 plan, called ``Operation Big Bird,'' couldhave retrieved billions from secret Swiss bank accounts held by theformer president and his associates. De Guzman said Marcos' Swissaccounts were worth at least $7 billion.   In testimony Monday before the House Committee on PublicAccountability, de Guzman said he would have transferred the moneyto the Philippine government for a 20 percent fee.   But he said the government sabotaged the plan by double-crossingthem at the last minute.   De Guzman said Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez and SenatePresident Jovito Salonga sabotaged the plan.   On Wednesday, Ordonez released a statement saying he opposed thescheme because de Guzman's Vienna bank, which would have receivedthe money, was insolvent.   De Guzman said the scheme was hatched in March 1986 _ one monthafter Marcos was ousted from power _ during meetings in Beirut,Lebanon, with undisclosed figures allegedly familiar with both Swissbanking regulations and Marcos' finances.   De Guzman said that on March 20, 1986, Marcos' son, Ferdinand``Bong-Bong'' Marcos Jr., authorized him to transfer funds fromfrozen Swiss accounts to the financier's Vienna bank. Marcos, whowas being watched by American agents, could not perform theoperation himself.   De Guzman said he got backing for his plan from Jose Cojuangco,President Corazon Aquino's brother, and other prominent figures.Accompanied by Philippine officials, including Ordonez, he flew toSwitzerland, where he presented the letters of authority from Marcosand received a list of the former president's deposits.   He said the Swiss agreed to a selective unfreezing of accountsworth $213 million but before a crucial final meeting, de Guzmansaid, Ordonez left Switzerland unexpectedly along with thePhilippine government's Swiss lawyers.   He learned later that the group had telexed Swiss authorities notto deposit the money in de Guzman's bank but in an account in CreditSuisse in Zurich.   The delays and apparent confusion enabled Marcos to learn of theplan and formally challenge the original letter of authority, deGuzman said.   Swiss officials then decided to continue the freeze, whichremains in effect, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
