It was the second major outage to hit the U.S.'s largestlong-distance communications carrier this year and the thirdsince January 1990. And the failure may have been caused byan electrical power surge when ATandamp;T switched back from itsown generators to the local power grid of Consolidated EdisonCorp. The phone company had gone over to its own generatorsbecause of soaring energy demands resulting from yesterday'sunseasonal heat.</LP><TEXT>   At about 4:50 p.m. EDT yesterday, ATandamp;T's network begancutting off calls into and out of Manhattan. The foulupturned into a chain reaction that snarled more than 200ultra-high-capacity communications lines handling everythingfrom phone calls to air-traffic control information andfinancial transactions.   Late last night, an ATandamp;T spokesman said the companyexpected full service to be restored by early this morningand that service was more than two-thirds restored as of 10p.m. last night.   ATandamp;T's latest failure underscores the continuingvulnerability of phone networks despite elaborate backupsystems designed to automatically route traffic aroundtrouble spots. ATandamp;T has spent several billions of dollars inrecent years to modernize and turn its network into a&quot;self-healing&quot; system that never quits transmitting calls.   The outage is also certain to tarnish the image of ATandamp;T,which has used an advertising blitz to promote the qualityand reliability of its phone services to lure residential andbusiness customers that had signed up with rivals MCICommunications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.   The Federal Communications Commission has beenincreasingly concerned about the spate of telephone outagesand has held two closed-door meetings recently withrepresentatives of industry to find out the cause of theproblems. Next month, the FCC plans a meeting ofinternational telecommunications officials in Geneva ontelephone network reliability.   The Federal Aviation Administration said air trafficcontrol services in the Northeast were severely disruptedyesterday. The FAA air traffic control centers communicatewith each other over lines run by ATandamp;T; yesterday, thoselines failed, just about bringing air service to astandstill.   Commercial banks reported delays in transferring fundsamong member banks of the Federal Reserve, forcing all banksto remain open until the problems were resolved. A spokesmanat Chase Manhattan Corp. said the bank remained open untilpayments were settled. While he said that Chase wasn'texperiencing any particular difficulties, &quot;if one bank has aproblem, all banks have to remain open.&quot;   An ATandamp;T spokesman said technicians at its NetworkOperations Center in Bedminster, N.J., traced the problem toa power supply failure in a Manhattan switching center. By 7p.m., ATandamp;T said technicians had restored traffic that flowsthrough Manhattan to other destinations. But the company wasstill struggling to restore systems that handle trafficoriginating and terminating in Manhattan.   ATandamp;T said late last night that it hadn't determinedwhether the power supply failure had been caused by theswitch to Con Ed's power system. &quot;We did do some loadsharingat Con Ed's request because of the heat,&quot; which sharplyincreased power demand for air conditioners, the spokesmansaid. &quot;But we can't establish any link between the fact thatwe did {go to our own power generators and then back to ConEd's} and the power supply problem.&quot;   In the January 1990 incident, a signaling system failurecut off millions of long-distance phone calls nationwide fornine hours. A year later, ATandamp;T suffered a second major outagewhen a high-capacity fiber-optic cable in New Jersey wasaccidentally cut.   Last night, MCI, ATandamp;T's chief competitor, said ATandamp;T'soutage hadn't caused any increase in traffic over itsnetwork. &quot;But that may be because the problem started inlower Manhattan and happened at the end of the day,&quot; said anMCI spokesman.   US Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., saidits service was interrupted to France, Germany and Spainbecause its traffic is routed through ATandamp;T's Manhattanswitching centers. A Sprint spokesman said the company wasable to reroute traffic to other cables including its owntrans-Atlantic system.   FCC officials said that ATandamp;T informed the agency that twoATandamp;T switches near Broadway suffered &quot;power failures.&quot; Theofficials didn't estimate the number of people affected bythe outage, but said an ATandamp;T official reported that 221ultra-high capacity communications lines went down.   The FCC said it was difficult to measure the effect onphone customers. Many businesses have equipment thatautomatically sends calls over other long-distance carrierswhen one carrier's lines are busy. Even those who don't havesuch equipment can use access codes to get MCI or Sprintlines. ATandamp;T said it instructed operators to give callers theaccess codes of its rivals so that they could still makecalls.   For many people, the disruption in the phone service paledin comparison to problems at New York-area airports.Late-afternoon and evening flights scheduled to leave thethree major airports were held on the ground, as were planesin other cities destined for New York. Planes in the air wererouted to other airports. A British Airways supersonicConcorde had to land at Bradley Airport outside Hartford,Conn. The plane was allowed to land at Kennedy two hourslater. Other British Airways departures were delayed as longas three hours, a spokesman said.   Last night, the FAA said flights were arriving at anddeparting from Kennedy and Newark airports in New York and atBoston's Logan Airport. Flights, as of late yesterday, hadn'tresumed at New York's La Guardia Airport.   A spokesman for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said theairline was forced to cancel a total of 23 flights because ofthe problem. Late yesterday, the airline was unsure whetherit would be able to resume its full schedule of service thismorning.   The FCC's Geneva meeting &quot;will clearly signal to thetelephone industry that all the governments take servicequality {and} reliability issues very seriously,&quot; a seniorFCC official said.   ATandamp;T's problems yesterday didn't appear similar to outageson the East and West coasts earlier this summer, said an FCCofficial involved with both cases. The earlier outages werecaused by glitches in signaling systems-high-speed networksthat carry signals to set up a call but not the call itself.   FCC officials have been upset by the lack of coordinationamong various telephone companies. For instance, telephonesystems in Britain and Germany seem to have avoided problemsin their signaling systems by modifying their systems in someways that don't accord with international standards. Phonesystems in Japan and Belgium, on the other hand, have hadproblems in their signaling systems that U.S. phone companieswere unaware of.   &quot;These companies in the communications business simplywere not communicating on the issue of network reliability,&quot;the senior FCC official said.   Yesterday, the failure caused some problems for the phonecompany itself. New York Telephone directory assistanceoperators had to look up and provide listings manuallybecause the lines that normally provide callers with numbersvia a computerized voice were down. &quot;We're all pretty busyhere trying to keep up,&quot; said one operator.   ---   Bob Davis and Laurie McGinley contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
