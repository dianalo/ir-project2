The networks had a combined average audience share of 65 for theMay sweep, 2 percent lower than May 1988, according to A.C. NielsenCo. ratings. Their combined rating was 37.8, compared with 38.7 inMay 1988.   The decline was less than the 3 percent rate of audience lossthe networks suffered in the 1988-89 season compared with the1987-88 season. That loss has been chalked up to the effects of thestrike, which delayed the start of the season, and inroads bycable, videocassettes and independent channels.   May is one of four ``sweeps'' months a year when localtelevision ratings are measured for use in negotiating futureadvertising rates. The networks tend to load their schedules withspecial programming to help local affiliates.   NBC, which just completed its fourth season win in a row, wonthe May sweep, too, with an average rating of 14.6. CBS had an11.8. Even though ABC had the two top-rated shows in the sweep, themade-for-TV movie ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of JessicaMcClure'' and the sitcom ``Roseanne,'' it came in third with an11.4.   NBC's two-parter, ``I Know My First Name Is Steven,'' was thehighest-rated multipart movie of the sweep, with a 24.5 rating and39 share. It was the highest-rated multiparter for NBC since``Fatal Vision'' in November 1984, and the highest-ratedmultiparter on any network since ``Lonesome Dove'' on CBS inFebruary.   ABC's five-part conclusion of ``War and Remembrance'' was thesecond highest-rated multiparter of the sweep, though it had aso-so 14.9 rating.   ``Everybody's Baby,'' based on the real-life 1987 rescue of aMidland, Texas, baby from an abandoned water well, had a 22.9rating and 36 share to become the top-rated show of the sweep.   ABC's ``Roseanne'' beat out NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' for secondplace, which NBC attributed to the effects of sunlight. ``Cosby''had a lower rating, but higher share, because of its 8 p.m. EDTtime period. Fewer people are in front of their sets in the earlyevening because it's still light outside. ``Roseanne'' has a 9 p.m.time period. And despite the performance of ``Roseanne,'' which waspre-empted at times during the sweep, ABC lost Tuesday night to NBC.   NBC won its 16th sweep in 17 sweeps. ABC had broken its winningstreak in February 1988 with the Winter Olympics. NBC has becomesuch a juggernaut, it is having a hard time finding newsuperlatives.   Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects, saidhe was so impressed that NBC had won five nights a week during theMay sweep, he had his staff check to see when a network lastaccomplished that feat. The answer: NBC _ in the last sweep inFebruary.</TEXT></DOC>
