In this study the authorscompared prostacyclin production and endothelial morphology in saphenousvein segments perfused either with cardioplegic solutions with a potassiumconcentration of 20, 40 and 80 mEq/1, or with a control buffer (1) at4 grade centigrades for 30 min; (2) at 37 grade centigrades for 15 min;(3) at 37 grade centigrades for 15 min after the addition of arachidonicacid. Prostacyclin production (6-keto-PGF/sub 1{alpha}/, pg/ml cm/sup2/ endothelial surface area) in control treated segments was a functionof temperature and of substrute availability, being (mean+-SEM) 62.4+-8.2in setting (1); 309+-34.7 in setting (2); and 1515.4+-205.2 in setting(3). Cardioplegic solution containing 20 mEq/1 potassium did not alterprostacyclin production in any of these settings, whereas exposure oftissue to the 40 mEq/1 potassium solution decreased prostacyclin productionin setting (21) and (2), and the solution containing 80 mEq/1 potassiumdecreased prostacyclin production in all three experimental conditions.Absence of endothelial detachment in all experimental settings was documentedby immunoperoxidase staining of vascular cross-sections for the specificendothelial marker Factor VIII - related antigen and staining of ''enface'' preparations of endothelial surface with silver nitrate and silvernitrate-hematoxylin. These data indicate that cardioplegic solutionswith a potassium concentration equal or greater than 40 mEq/1 can inducemorphologically silent endothelial damage manifested by decreased prostacyclinproduction. The use of these solutions may predispose to possible thrombogenicityafter coronary bypass surgery. 28 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
