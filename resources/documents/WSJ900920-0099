Chairman Thomas Plaskett said he's slashing2,500 jobs from the company's payroll, axing sometrans-Atlantic service and shifting to smaller aircraft in aneffort to cope with higher fuel costs and sluggish passengerdemand.   The action by the parent of Pan American Airways, one ofthe country's major carriers, is the largest work forcereduction announced so far this year by any airline holdingcompany.</LP><TEXT>   Industry analysts said the company's plan is a harbingerof further troubles to come in an industry whose outlook hasbeen darkening in the days since Iraq invaded Kuwait.   The company said it plans to eliminate the 2,500 jobs, or8.6% of its work force, during the fourth quarter throughvoluntary leaves of absence, attrition and furloughs. Mr.Plaskett said the furloughs will affect management officialsas well as rank-and-file employees.   Mr. Plaskett, speaking at a Wall Street airlines analystmeeting, said that he plans to cut Pan Am's capacity by 7.5%to 42.96 billion available seat miles in 1991 from 46.43billion available seat miles in 1990.   The largest chunk of the service cuts will come from PanAm's trans-Atlantic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plansto reduce capacity by 15.4% next year compared with thisyear.   For one thing, Mr. Plaskett said he will be droppingBoeing Co.'s 412-seat 747 jet on several trans-Atlanticroutes and replacing it with Airbus Industrie's smaller192-seat A310-300 aircraft.   Although Pan Am's already-low stock remained unchanged at$1.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading, theannouncement came as good news to many Wall Street analysts,long-familiar with Pan Am's difficulty turning a profit.   &quot;They didn't get up there and dish out a bunch ofbaloney,&quot; said Roseanne Tortora, an airlines analyst atCounty NatWest Securities. &quot;When push comes to shove, I don'tknow if it will be enough, but they have a plan that appearsto be well thought out.&quot;   Already, other carriers have tried to take bites out oftheir budgets. USAir Group Inc.'s Chairman Edwin Colodny lastmonth said he is laying off 6.7% of his carrier's work forceof 54,000 employees.   Other carriers are said to be discussing similar furloughplans. Robert Crandall, chairman at AMR Corp.'s AmericanAirlines, is slashing operational costs in a campaign thatincludes an edict to workers to turn off lights afterquitting time.   As part of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic switch in planes, Mr.Plaskett said he plans to return five leased Boeing 747-400sto General Electric Credit Corp., a General Electric Co.unit, by April 1991.   Another large part of the service reduction is coming fromPan Am's domestic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plansto cut capacity by 10.1% next year versus this year.   Among other things, Pan Am plans include closing itsoffices in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati and San Antonio, Texas.It is also cutting a number of domestic flights from its hubof operations at New York's John F. Kennedy InternationalAirport.   All the while, Mr. Plaskett said that he plans to boostthe carrier's Latin American service out of Miami, which thecarrier has been building as a hub of operations. Thecompany's plans include increasing Pan Am service out ofMiami to 82 flights next year from 63 departures in 1989 andthe first half of 1990.   By 1995, Pan Am says it plans to increase the number offlights to 231 daily departures, including its commuterflights.   Pan Am's layoff program may raise tensions with theTeamsters, which represents about 6,500 employees. It isn'tclear how many of its members will lose their jobs.   Yesterday, Teamster officials met in Washington, D.C., todiscuss whether to call a strike at Pan Am. Already, theunion, which is in the midst of contract negotiations, hasbeen conducting a work-slowdown campaign at Pan Am.   &quot;The company is in trouble,&quot; said George Miranda, a topofficial at the union's airline division.   Just days ago, in fact, Pan Am reached an agreement withgovernment regulators to defer $53 million in pension-planpayments until November. That comes on top of $106.4 millionin bills that Pan Am deferred paying earlier this year tothree big creditors.   Pan Am is turning to a longstanding practice of trying toremedy its cash problem by selling assets. Yesterday, Mr.Plaskett said &quot;several&quot; parties are interested in buying theairline holding company's Pan Am Shuttle unit, which he saidshould be sold by year end. He cautioned, however, that apurchase most likely wouldn't be completed until early 1991.   Although Mr. Plaskett wouldn't identify the partiesinvolved in the shuttle talks, industry sources have pointedto America West Airlines as a possible buyer.   The company already has one sale under its belt this year.It recently announced the sale of its inter-German service toLufthansa German Airlines for $150 million. It should getcash from that sale during the fourth quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
