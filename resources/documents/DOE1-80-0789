These factors,coupled with its low commercial value (less than 20 years ago steam coalsold for $4 per short ton) resulted in many wasteful mining and preparationpractices and the -0.5mm fines were frequently discarded with the refuse.More recently, however, two major factors, (1) the large increase inthe value of coal and (2) environmental considerations, have served toplace a greater emphasis on achieving high recoveries of coal at thelowest ash and sulfur content reasonably possible. Most assuredly, thiswill dictate that a greater effort be made to improve the efficiencyand cost effectiveness of fine coal cleaning procedures. Fine coal cleaningwas often ignored in the U.S. in the past, resulting in either the needlesswaste of fine coal or the dilution of the coarse cleaned product. Exceptionsto this neglect were the cleaning of the higher value coking coals andof anthracite. In these instances a much greater attention was paid tofine gravity and flotation cleaning methods. The Europeans, whose coalswere more difficult to mine and, hence, more expensive, also placed greateremphasis on fine cleaning, and there were aggressive research and developmentprograms in France, Great Britain, The Netherlands and West Germany.Unfortunately, much of this research was aborted in the 1950's by thediscovery of large oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. Further developmentof fine cleaning procedures now rest largely on organizations in theUnited States, with some help from groups in Austalia, Britain, Canada,India, South Africa and the U.S.S.R. Effective processing of coal fineswill generally pose a greater problem in the United States than in othernations; most especially for sulfur reduction. Successful solutions tothe problem will offer great rewards.</TEXT></DOC>
