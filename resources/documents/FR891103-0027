The new minimumleverage ratio would operate in conjunction with the OCC's risk-based capitalguidelines and would limit the amount of leverage a national bank can undertake.The    intended effect of this amendment is to ensure the continued safetyand soundness of the national banking system.

The OCC's final risk-based capitalguidelines were published on January 27, 1989 (54 FR 4168). That standardbecomes effective for all national banks on December 31, 1990. When the OCC published its risk-based capital proposal on March 15, 1988,(53 FR 8550), it raised the possibility that the existing minimum capitalrequirements in 12 CFR part 3 would be replaced by an 8.0 percent minimumrisk-based capital standard. However, the OCC stated that, if it determinedthat a minimum leverage ratio should be retained in addition to risk-basedcapital, the definition of capital might be modified to be consistent withthe one contained in the risk-based capital guidelines. <T3>Id. </T3>The OCC received 122 comments in response to the risk-based capital proposal.Sixteen commenters discussed whether a minimum leverage ratio should remainin place alongside the new risk-based capital standard. That is, thesecommenters addressed the issue of whether there should be ``tandem capitalratios,'' with one ratio calculated as a percentage of total assets andthe other ratio based on a bank's risk-weighted assets. Most commentersstated that the existing capital requirements should be phased out as quicklyas possible to avoid what they perceived as a potentially burdensome dualsystem of capital maintenance. These commenters stated that retaining aleverage constraint might decrease the incentive offered by the risk-basedcapital system to minimize credit risk. They argued that the risk-basedtest is a superior measure of capital adequacy and, in order to operateeffectively, it must not be constrained by the imposition of a separateminimum leverage ratio. One commenter suggested that some minimum amount of capital should be requiredin response to the hypothetical possibility of a zero capital requirement.The commenter stated that some capital protection is needed against lossesthat might result from errors in management judgment, or from any numberof other risks not recognized by risk-based capital_<T3>e.g., </T3>fiduciary liability, underwriting liability, or employeedishonesty. Several commenters addressed the concern about the potentialfor a zero capital requirement and pointed out that the lower yields associatedwith relatively riskless assets serve as an inherent constraint againstunrestricted growth.On a related point, another commenter mentioned that, even if the OCC eliminatedthe present capital adequacy requirements, it should continue using theexisting definition of capital for lending limits and other statutory and/orregulatory limits that are based on a bank's capital and/or capital andsurplus. The rationale behind this comment was that the existing definitionallows banks to include the entire amount of their allowance for loan andlease losses (``ALLL'') in capital. The commenter stated that the fullALLL should be included for these purposes, because it is all availableto meet risks associated with these statutory and regulatory limitations.When the final risk-based capital guidelines were published on January27, 1989, the OCC announced its decision to supplement risk-based capitalwith a minimum leverage ratio for the following reasons. First, the 8.0percent minimum risk-based capital standard is designed principally asa measure of credit risk; therefore, there are a number of other bankingrisks that it does not address_<T3>e.g., </T3>interest rate risk, operational risk and asset concentrations.Second, the leverage ratio, because it is based upon total, rather thanrisk-adjusted, assets, will eliminate the possibility for significant leveragethat exists under the risk-based capital guidelines. In order to implement that decision, the OCC, in this notice, is proposingto change the definition of capital in Part 3 to be consistent with therisk-based capital guidelines and adjust the minimum leverage ratio requiredby 12 CFR part 3. (The definitions of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital are inandSection; 3.2 of the attached amendments section.) The OCC believes thatthe changes in the definition of capital, the implementation of a risk-basedcapital standard, and the proposed minimum leverage ratio together willensure sufficient capital for national banks. Therefore, the OCC is proposingthat the revised leverage ratio become effective concurrent with risk-basedcapital guidelines on December 31, 1990. Until that date, the current capitalrequirements based on primary and total capital will remain effective.This notice of proposed rulemaking also includes technical changes to theOCC's Interpretive Ruling 3.100 (<T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 3.100), which interprets the statutory terms ``capital''and ``surplus.'' However, it is not envisioned that these changes wouldhave any substantive impact on those definitions. Thus, it is not intendedthat this rulemaking would have any effect on the lending limit or otheractivities that are limited by statute or regulation as a percentage of``capital'' and/or ``surplus.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Amendments </ITAG>Minimum Capital Requirements The OCC, like other domestic and foreign bank regulators, believes thata bank's capital requirement should be related to the risk associated withits assets and off-balance sheet activities, along with appropriate considerationof other relevant factors. Therefore, the risk-based capital standard,when it becomes effective on December 31, 1990, will be the OCC's primaryfocus in evaluating the adequacy of a national bank's capital. However,in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirement, the OCC is proposingto retain a minimum leverage ratio. Under this proposal, a bank would haveto meet both the minimum risk-based capital standard and the minimum leverageratio. A bank that satisfies one minimum requirement, but not the other,would have to raise capital or adjust its portfolio so that it meets bothof the requirements. Taken together, the tandem capital requirements establisha coherent, rational approach to bank capital regulation. Illustration of Tandem Capital Requirements The clearest way to demonstrate the combined effect of the risk-based capitalguidelines and the proposed leverage ratio is with the assistance of somesimple illustrations. The data needed to calculate capital ratios for threesample banks are presented in table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,8,6,6 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Capital and Asset Data for Illustrative Banks </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions of dollars] </ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;1 </H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;2 </H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;3</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 1 Capital <D>500 </D><D>10 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tier 2 Capital <D>250 </D><D>\1\.875 </D><D>\2\.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Risk Weighted Assets <D>10,000 </D><D>70 </D><D>25 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Assets <D>10,000 </D><D>100 </D><D>100 </D><F>\1\ The actual allowance for loan and lease losses is 1 million dollarsor one percent of total assets (.01andmultiply;100=1). However, one-eighthof this is ineligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital because it exceeds1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets. These percentages are representativeof the average community bank. </F><F>\2\ In this case, 70 percent of the allowance for loan and lease lossesis ineligible for Tier 2 capital because it exceeds 1.25 percent of risk-weightedassets.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Bank andplusmin;1 is a hypothetical multinational bank. This bank has significantTier 2 capital made up of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subordinateddebt, and preferred stock. The bank also has significant off-balance sheetactivities. The inclusion of off-balance sheet activities makes the riskadjusted assets approximately equal to total assets. Bank andplusmin;2 is a typical community bank. It has no Tier 2 capital otherthan the allowance for loan and lease losses. The risk-weighted assetsare significantly lower than total assets because (1) many of the bank'sassets are in the 50 percent or 20 percent risk-weight categories and (2)almost all of the bank's off-balance sheet activities receive a zero percentconversion factor. Bank andplusmin;3 is also a community bank. It is assumed that this bankis trying to minimize its capital levels. It has adopted a two-part strategyof reducing its capital level and rearranging its balance sheet into extremelylow risk-weighted assets. The OCC does not expect banks to respond to therisk-based capital guidelines in this fashion. If a bank were to structureits assets in this manner, the proposed leverage ratio is designed to insureadequate capital.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,6,6,6 </C><T4>Table</T4> 2._<T4>Capital Ratios </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;1 (percent)</H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;2 (percent) </H1><H1>Bank andplusmin;3 (percent)</H1> Tier 1 Capital:<ITAG tagnum="2">Risk-Weighted Assets <D>5.0 </D><D>14.3 </D><D>8.0  </D></ITAG>Tier 1+Tier 2:<ITAG tagnum="2">Risk-Weighted Assets <D>7.5 </D><D>15.5 </D><D>9.2  </D></ITAG>Tier 1 Capital:<ITAG tagnum="4">Total Assets <D>5.0 </D><D>10.0 </D><D>2.0 </D></ITAG></ITAG> The multinational bank does not meet the minimum capital requirements,even though it meets the minimum leverage ratio. It does not have sufficientcapital to meet the 8.0 percent minimum total capital to risk-weightedassets ratio. The bank would have to increase Tier 1 capital, increaseTier 2 capital, decrease its assets or off-balance sheet activities, orrearrange its portfolio into lower risk weight categories to meet the minimumcapital requirements. Because the risk-based capital requirements onlyaccount for credit risk, this bank also would likely be required to increaseits capital levels beyond the 8.0 percent minimum to provide sufficientprotection from the other risks inherent in the bank's activities. Bank andplusmin;2 has sufficient capital to meet all regulatory requirements.Like most community banks, it is currently operating well above minimumregulatory requirements. We would not expect such a bank to decrease itscapital levels solely in response to the new minimum capital requirements.The second community bank has significantly decreased its capital levels,but, because of changes in its portfolio, the bank continues to meet therisk-based capital requirements. However, it does not meet the minimumleverage ratio requirement. This bank would be forced to shrink its assetsize or increase its Tier 1 capital to meet minimum capital requirements.In addition, because many of the items in the low-risk-weight categoriesmay have significant interest rate risk (<T3>e.g.,</T3> mortgage-backed securities), this bank would likely be requiredto increase its capital levels well above the regulatory minimums. Improved Capital Standards Taken as a whole, the new capital framework is designed to strengthen capitalin the national banking system by making two important changes. First,risk-based capital provides a refined methodology for relating capitaladequacy to the individual risk profile of a particular bank. Second, thenew definitions of capital utilized in both the risk-based capital guidelinesand the proposed minimum leverage ratio reflect a more stringent capitalstandard with a strong emphasis on the purest forms of equity capital.This approach significantly reduces the ability of banks to use ``soft''capital in fulfilling their capital requirements. The minimum leverage ratio (capital-to-total assets) is in 12 CFR part3. The OCC is proposing to amend the minimum capital ratio contained in12 CFR 3.6 to a level that reflects the impact of the change in the definitionof capital and the fact that it will be operating in tandem with the risk-basedcapital standard. The OCC, in evaluating this issue, contemplated severalalternatives to the current minimum capital ratios found in 12 CFR 3.6.After evaluating the alternatives, the OCC is proposing that, as of December31, 1990, a national bank will have to satisfy both the minimum risk-basedcapital standard (7.25 percent until December 31, 1992 and thereafter,8.0 percent) and the 3.0 percent Tier 1 capital-to-total assets.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The total assets figure, used as the denominator of theleverage ratio, would be calculated by making the following adjustmentsto the average total assets figure reported in the bank's most recent CallReport. The period-end balance of the allowance for loan and lease losseswould be added to the bank's average total assets, which does not includethe allowance, and any intangible assets that have been deducted from Tier1 capital, would also be deducted from average total assets. Capital standards must provide adequate protection against insolvency.They become counterproductive when they become so burdensome that theydeny a bank the ability to compete or to provide a sufficient return toattract investors. The combination of risk-based capital and the proposedleverage ratio together with the new definition of capital provide an adequatelevel of capital protection for national banks. Because of the significant changes in the definition of capital, the existingprimary and total capital standards are not directly comparable to theproposed 3.0 percent leverage ratio. The definition of Tier 1 capital emphasizesequity capital by not including a number of items that are presently includedin primary capital. For example, the allowance for loan and lease losses,cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and mandatory convertible debt whichare included in primary capital, are not included in Tier 1 capital. Therefore,one cannot state categorically whether a 3.0 percent leverage ratio ismore or less stringent than the current capital requirements. Furthermore,since the proposed leverage ratio would operate in conjunction with risk-basedcapital, it is inappropriate to view the proposed 3.0 percent Tier 1 requirementas the sole determination of capital adequacy. In fact, in most instances,the amount of capital required under the risk-based capital guidelineswill exceed the amount required by the proposed 3.0 percent leverage ratio.The OCC expects that many more banks will have more difficulty attainingthe minimum capital requirements under the new tandem system than underthe existing system and that overall, more capital will be required inthe national banking system for all banks to meet minimum capital requirements.The OCC considered, among other options, proposing to maintain the current6.0 percent capital standard (consisting of 5.5 percent primary capitaland 0.5 percent secondary capital), while substituting the new definitionsof Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital for primary and secondary capital respectively.On the surface, a 6.0 percent minimum leverage ratio appears to resemblethe current total capital requirement. However, because the new capitaldefinitions place several restrictions on particular components that donot exist in the current capital requirements, a revised 6.0 percent leverageratio using the new definitions would be significantly more severe thanthe current capital requirements. As a result, maintaining the minimumleverage ratio at 6.0 percent would have two undesirable effects. First,it would require a number of adequately capitalized banks to raise additionalcapital. Second, it, rather than the risk-based capital standard, wouldbecome the operative capital standard for most banks. This is contraryto the OCC's intention for the risk-based capital standard to be the primaryfocus in the evaluation of capital adequacy. By limiting the minimum leverage ratio to Tier 1 capital, the OCC wouldrequire banks to have pure equity that is readily available to absorb losses.This approach is consistent with the OCC's recently proposed rule on equityinsolvency that would change the definition of net worth for the purposeof declaring a national bank insolvent. <T3>See </T3> 54 FR 28072 (July 5, 1989). At present, the OCC declaresa bank insolvent under the net worth standard when its primary capitalis depleted. As proposed, the OCC would declare a bank insolvent when itsequity capital, as opposed to primary capital, is exhausted. The majordifference between the use of primary capital and equity capital as theinsolvency standard is the exclusion from capital of the bank's allowancefor loan and lease losses (``ALLL''). In addition to the capital standards prescribed by the OCC, every nationalbank must maintain an ALLL that adequately covers the reasonably anticipatedlosses in its loan portfolio. The OCC will continue to assess the adequacyof a bank's ALLL, relative to the quality of its assets, as part of thenormal regulatory supervision of each institution. Thus, the ALLL providesan additional cushion that is available to supplement the protection offeredby both the risk-based capital standard and the proposed leverage ratio.The minimum leverage ratio represents a floor below which capital may notdecrease; the actual capital a bank will be required to hold will be atleast as great as the amount that meets the risk-based capital standardand the leverage ratio. However, it is important to note that these capitalrequirements are minimums. As they have in the past, many banks, on theirown initiative, will maintain capital levels that exceed the minimums.Additionally, the OCC will continue to assess both the quality of riskmanagement systems and the level of overall risk in individual banks throughthe supervisory process and, as at present, will require additional capitalas warranted. In other words, the OCC's final supervisory judgment on abank's capital adequacy, in terms of both risk-based capital and the minimumleverage ratio, will still be based on an assessment of the relevant factorspresent in each bank and, in the case of most banks, will be higher thanthe regulatory minimums. Transition Period The transition period, announced upon adoption of the risk-based capitalguidelines, provides banks with adequate time to raise additional capitalor to make changes in the volume or structure of their assets and off-balancesheet activities in anticipation of the new capital standards. If adopted,these amendments to 12 CFR part 3 would become effective on December 31,1990, and would coincide with the effective date of the risk-based capitalguidelines. Therefore, as of that date, banks would be required (1) tocomply with the provisions of the risk-based capital guidelines and, (2)to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 3.0 percent Tier 1 capital-to-totalassets. Other Changes The OCC is also proposing to add a new paragraph prior to paragraph (a)of andSection; 3.100 and to make a few minor, technical corrections in thatinterpretive ruling. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of andSection; 3.100 are theregulatory provisions interpreting the statutory terms ``capital'' and``surplus'' respectively. The new paragraph, as proposed, will clarifythat the definitions of andSection; 3.100 are solely for use in determiningstatutory limits that are based on the amount of a bank's ``capital,''and/or ``surplus,'' not its risk-based capital or minimum leverage ratios.Therefore, the proposal will not have any effect on either a bank's lendinglimit or the size of transactions a bank can permissibly conduct with itsaffiliates_the two most widely used limits calculated as a percentage ofa bank's capital and surplus. The proposal also amends certain other provisions of 12 CFR part 3 to makethe risk-based capital guidelines an essential component in the processof establishing a bank's required minimum capital level. For example, aspecific reference to Appendix A of part 3 (risk-based capital guidelines)has been added to andSection; 3.9. That section gives the OCC the authorityto establish a higher minimum capital requirement for an individual bank.The proposal makes Appendix A to part 3 an integral component of the formalizedestablishment of minimum capital ratios for an individual bank under subpartC of 12 CFR part 3. The incorporation of the risk-based capital guidelinesinto 12 CFR part 3 does not represent a substantive change as AppendixA is binding on national banks when it becomes effective. Issues for Specific Comment The OCC is seeking comments on all aspects of the proposed amendments to12 CFR part 3. The agency especially invites comments on the followingissues: 1. The proposed amendments set the minimum leverage ratio at 3.0 percentTier 1 capital-to-total assets. The OCC is seeking comment on whether adifferent minimum leverage ratio, for example, 3.0 percent Tier 1 capital-to-totalassets<T3> and </T3>6.0 percent total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital-to-total assets,would be more effective. 2. The proposed amendments do not envision making any substantive changesin the current definition of capital and surplus for the purposes of variousstatutory limits, such as the lending limit. The OCC is seeking commenton whether it should adjust the definition of capital and surplus in orderto have a consistent regulatory definition of capital. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Comptrollerof the Currency certifies that these changes, if adopted, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>The OCC has determined that this proposal does not constitute a major rulewithin the meaning of Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis will not be required on the grounds that this revision(1) would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,(2) would not result in a major increase in the cost of bank operationsor governmental supervision, and (3) would not have a significant adverseeffect on competition (foreign or domestic), employment, investment, productivity,or innovation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 3 </ITAG>National banks, Capital, Leverage, Risk. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 12, chapter I, part 3of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
