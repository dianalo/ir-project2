These voters, who by now know the candidates better than almost anyone else in America does, have made their first cuts, based on personality and character. Now they are subjecting the candidates to a tougher test, seeking proof that they measure up to the seriousness of the task.    &quot;I see a lot of firefighting -- putting out fires as they break out,&quot; says Paul Kelley, a quiet-spoken, 31-year-old Democrat and an electrical engineer. &quot;But I'm still looking for a good plan for the future.&quot; Mark Reinertson, 38, a Republican physician, wants someone &quot;like the Reagan we saw eight years ago, when he was adept, not inept, as a leader.&quot;    Less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the first great divide in the campaign, two dozen Iowa voters brought together by pollster Peter Hart for The Wall Street Journal are moving beyond images. They are looking at ideas -- not so much to find a candidate who agrees with them but for evidence that the candidates have thought things through.    Thus, according to 12 Iowa Republicans, the GOP contest doesn't pivot on issues of personal background or resumes vs. records, but on the question of who can make tough choices, make things happen. Virginia Howes, 46, a conservative Republican schoolteacher, talks of the need for a hands-on president, &quot;a decision maker . . . a problem solver.&quot;    And 12 Iowa Democrats, meeting separately, play down the importance of ideological differences among their party's candidates. They want competence, but they also want something beyond that, a president who knows and understands the struggles of their daily lives. &quot;I feel like we've been lost in the shuffle. I think the nation has lost its priorities and perspective,&quot; says Mary Ann Cady, a 40-year-old clerk-typist. Adds Simon Brooks III, 43, an engineer: &quot;We need to get back to caring about all the people in this country.&quot;    The 1988 election as seen by these 24 Iowans &quot;isn't a fight for the heart and soul of either party,&quot; Mr. Hart concludes after conducting the sessions. &quot;There are no distinguishing issues of principle here,&quot; he says, &quot;but there is a premium on making hard choices.&quot;    The two discussion groups, conducted late last week, are far too small to represent a scientific sample of public opinion in Iowa. But a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll gives a sense of some of the forces at work in the campaign. The poll shows that among Republicans nationwide who are likely voters, both Vice President George Bush and Senate GOP leader Robert Dole have slipped somewhat after their increasingly sharp exchanges, but that their quest for the GOP nomination remains basically a two-man race.    Among the Democrats the poll, which was conducted last Wednesday through Friday, indicates that the situation remains highly volatile. The candidates are still tightly bunched, with former Sen. Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson leading and the others in single digits.    Such national polls still reflect, to a large degree, the name recognition of the candidates. Even in Iowa, where the candidates have been focusing time and money for more than a year, the results are still fluid, and the voting Feb. 8 may be inconclusive on the Democratic side if several candidates finish close together.    Still, these Iowans have studied the candidates at close range, and by now their impressions are finely etched. Like slides on a screen, those impressions flash by when pollster Hart asks these voters to imagine a hypothetical situation. A candidate finds himself fifth in line at an airport ticket counter. There is only one ticket left. What does that candidate do?    Pat Robertson, says Republican Charles West, 62, himself a minister, &quot;is going to say, 'Let us pray,' and when they kneel, he's going to the front of the line.&quot;    George Bush will &quot;pull rank,&quot; says Mrs. Howes, the Republican teacher.    Robert Dole &quot;would negotiate -- or whatever it took&quot; to get himself a seat, says Ruth Walker, a grandmotherly housewife who is a moderate Republican.    Michael Dukakis &quot;will find another way; he's very resourceful,&quot; says Patricia Arenas, 57, a social worker and a Democrat.    Richard Gephardt &quot;will give his seat to a lady,&quot; predicts Democrat Rex Phillips Jr., 62, a retired truck driver in an Iowa Hawkeye jacket. &quot;A lady with a baby,&quot; interjects fellow Democrat Marjeanne Jungjohann, 51, a secretary.    In discussions of the candidates, Gary Hart predictably gets higher marks for courage than for judgment. &quot;He doesn't give up,&quot; says Ruth Dolan, a 32-year-old Democratic schoolteacher. &quot;He just keeps throwing himself to the wolves.&quot;    &quot;Not only to wolves,&quot; adds Mr. Brooks, the engineer, as the group breaks into laughter.    Less predictably, Sen. Dole takes flak in the GOP group for his &quot;he's one of us&quot; theme. &quot;Baloney,&quot; says Lyle Bowlin, 34, a professor of management who is looking for more substance. &quot;I might go for that if I wanted somebody to run the state Future Farmers of America.&quot;    But Scott Brown, 18, a fresh-faced high-school senior and Bush supporter, praises Sen. Dole as a &quot;down-to-earth guy.&quot; And Linda Teague, 44, a GOP moderate who serves on a school board, has made a pleasant discovery about Vice President Bush: &quot;This guy's got more backbone than I thought.&quot;    The Republicans here seem closer than the Democrats to narrowing down their field. &quot;The Republicans really have a sense of this race,&quot; says pollster Hart, a Democrat who isn't working for any presidential candidate this year. &quot;They haven't reached their final choice, but they know where they're headed and what they're looking for.&quot; Many of them are looking for a next president to fulfill the promise of the Reagan presidency, whose legacy has clearly disappointed them.    &quot;It was a terrible disappointment living through history with the Ollie North thing and what came out,&quot; says Mrs. Walker, the GOP housewife. &quot;What used to be doesn't seem to be now, as far as the integrity of America.&quot;    The Democratic group, with no front-runner to shape the contest, seems a lot further away from putting this election together. Mrs. Dolan, the teacher, says: &quot;There are bits and pieces of each of those people I'd like to kind of jell together and make a whole new person.&quot;    The nationwide Journal/NBC poll shows that Mr. Bush is the choice of 37% of likely GOP voters, while Mr. Dole is the choice of 25%. No other Republican candidate has more than 6%. But those figures represent a decline for both major candidates from a poll released early last month, and the percentage of Republicans pleased with the field of candidates also slipped, to 58% from 64%, suggesting that the increasing acrimony of the GOP campaign may be taking a toll.    Moreover, a close look at the poll discloses some problems for Mr. Bush, despite his lead. Twice as many likely GOP voters think Sen. Dole would make a very strong leader as think Mr. Bush would; Republicans are split nearly evenly on whether the vice president is tough enough to be a good president. Although Mr. Bush is seen as experienced and more compassionate, Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin don't think he has given a full accounting of his role in the Iran-Contra scandal.    The Democratic race remains so fragmented that even the nominal leader, Gary Hart, has the support of less than one in five likely Democratic voters -- and another one in five says he could not support him against a Republican in the general election. Although Democrats' satisfaction with the current pack of candidates has increased to 36% from 28% in the previous poll, a majority still wish someone else were running.    Here in the Iowa discussion groups, members of both parties say they are looking for a problem-solver president, but the two agendas are quite different. GOP voters talk about values and morality and about foreign affairs. The Democrats say they want compassion and more jobs here at home.    The Iowa voters aren't looking for ideological litmus tests or the pork-barrel promises of the past. They are less interested in what a candidate will do for them than in what he will ask of them on the nation's behalf. &quot;Too many of us think 'me' instead of 'we,'&quot; says Sue Becker, a 35-year-old hairdresser in the Democratic group.    But the Iowans are acutely sensitive to any hint of artifice -- even in Paul Simon, who has made his very lack of glamour a campaign theme. &quot;It almost seems like he's playing the semi-nerd,&quot; says Democrat Mary Huneke, a 34-year-old University of Iowa instructor.    Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are feeling upbeat about America. They are worried about the trade and budget deficits and wary of easy answers. As evidence that candidates are serious about tackling such problems, these voters want ideas -- even if, as they admit, telling a good idea from a bad one can be difficult. Beverly Berry, 50, the manager of a pancake house, fears that Rep. Gephardt's tough trade policies would hurt Iowa farmers. Yet she likes a Gephardt commercial flaying South Korea for barriers that purportedly make a $10,000 Chrysler cost $48,000 there, and she may vote for him.    Hanging over both groups is a disappointment in the perceived shortcomings and scandals of the Reagan administration. Yet integrity clearly isn't enough for these Iowa voters. They are listening for substance now. As Mr. West, the GOP minister, puts it: &quot;You have to be an effective communicator, but you've got to have something real meaningful to communicate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
