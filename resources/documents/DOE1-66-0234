<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0234 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of test runs of the exploratory VC model were performed. Theeffects of major design/operation parameters on the hydrodynamic structureand the particle behavior in the vortexing chamber were qualitativelyverified. Systematic tests demonstrated that the particle distributionin the vortexing chamber can be controlled, for instance, by properlyarranging the primary- and secondary-air flow ratio. Measurements ofthe swirling gas flow field on the bench-scale VC model have also beenmade. A preliminary but clear picture of the vortices and streamlinesin the vortexing chamber was attained. The results obtained to date arequite encouraging. With regard to the mathematical modeling of the VCprocesses, the k - {epsilon} turbulence model has been successfully incorporatedin our computer code. Discussions and comparison of calculated resultswith the k - {epsilon} model and the Constant Viscosity Model (CVM) arepresented. Future efforts will be focused on further measurements ofthe gas flow field in the bench-scale VC model. Development of instrumentationfor swirling particle flow and preparation of particle flow field measurementsare on-going. Based on the results given by k - {epsilon} model, a moreadvanced and realistic Algebraic Stress Model (ASM) will be adopted tofurther improve the prediction of the swirling turbulent gas flow inVC. With the experience learned in the exploratory and bench-scale VCmodels, the design/fabrication of the large VC model is to be conducted.4 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
