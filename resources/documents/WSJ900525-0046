The $8.5 billion of notes were auctioned by the Treasuryyesterday at an average yield of 8.54%. That was the highestyield set at a five-year, two-month auction since May 1989and was even slightly higher than the previous five-year,two-month note auction Feb. 22 when the average yield was8.53%.</LP><TEXT>   But some traders said the yield may not have been highenough to attract investors. Bond dealers said the poorresults reflected weaker-than-expected demand by domestic andforeign buyers, although they weren't sure why investorsshied away. Other dealers said that Japanese investors, whotend to buy moderate amounts of the notes, were nearlynonexistent at yesterday's auction.   &quot;It seems like the psychology in the market just suddenlyturned from positive to negative,&quot; said John Costas,co-manager of government trading at First Boston Corp. Hesaid that investors expressed interest in buying the notes,&quot;but when it came time to bid, we didn't see,&quot; much interest.He suspects that some investors may have already &quot;burned alot of cash&quot; at Wednesday's two-year note auction and severalweeks ago at the Treasury's huge $30.5 billion refunding ofthe government debt.   In early trading yesterday, bond prices were unchanged toslightly higher. But when rumors circulated that the auctionwas poorly received, prices of Treasury securities movedlower as dealers reduced prices in an effort to drum updemand.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 3/8 pointlower, a loss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 faceamount, to yield 8.60%. In when-issued trading activity, theyield on the new five-year, two-month notes rose to 8.56%.   In the junk bond market, prices of R.H. Macy andamp; Co. junkbonds plunged on news that a leading factoring firm tightenedits credit standards toward the retailer.   Some Macy bonds fell five points, or $50 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount, and yields spurted as high as 25%.   Henry Kassebaum, a senior vice president at HellerFinancial Corp., confirmed rumors that Heller Financialshifted from a &quot;revolving credit&quot; policy toward Macysuppliers to an &quot;order-by-order&quot; policy. Instead of extendinga revolving credit line to Macy suppliers, Heller will nowdecide whether to extend credit to suppliers on anorder-by-order basis.   In response, Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures,maturing in 2001, fell more than five points to 57. Theretailer's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,also shed five points to end at 67.   Factoring companies like Heller buy receivables at aslight discount from suppliers that sell goods to retailers.A supplier is paid in cash for its receivables and thefactoring agent assumes the risk that the retailer will payits bills.   The problems of Macy's pulled the entire junk bond marketlower, with most issues ending between 1/4 and 1/2 pointlower. Market participants expect bids for the bonds toweaken further when the market opens today.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          U.S. Treasury notes and bonds traded lower after thegovernment's $8.5 billion auction of new five-year, two-monthTreasury notes failed to stir enthusiasm in investors.   The auction results were unexpected, especially comingafter a successful twoyear note auction on Wednesday.   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late ata price of 101 13/32 compared with 101 27/32 on Wednesday.The latest 10-year notes ended at 101 16/32 to yield 8.63%compared with 101 27/32 to yield 8.58%.   Short-term rates were higher. The discount rate onthree-month Treasury bills ended at 7.68% for a bondequivalent yield of 7.92% while the rate on six-month billsfell to 7.71% to yield 8.11%.   Here are details of yesterday's fiveyear, two-month noteauction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

Junk Bonds                                                                                                          The problems of R.H. Macy's spread to the broader junkbond market, pushing prices moderately lower.   Besides Macy's, other big decliners included RJR NabiscoInc., whose bonds fell on talk that a major investor wasdumping large amounts of the bonds.   RJR Nabisco's 14.07% convertible payin-kind debentures,due in 2009, finished down 1 1/2 points to close at 84 on theNew York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the14.07% exchangable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007,ended 1 3/8 points lower to close at 70 1/4.   Duracell Holdings' 13.5% subordinated debentures, maturingin 2000, dropped 1/4 point to end at 103, while Kroger's 127/8% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1999, shed 1/2point to 102 1/4.   In the investment-grade market, actively traded corporateissues fell 1/4 to 3/8 point.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities posted small price advances, outpacingTreasurys and causing yield spreads to tighten slightly.   Government National Mortgage Association 9% bonds for Junedelivery firmed 1/32 to 96 for a yield of 9.72%, 1.10percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.That spread is 0.02 percentage point tighter than lateWednesday.   Among other actively traded issues, Ginnie Mae 9.5% bondsfor June delivery were up 1/32 at 98 14/32; Ginnie Mae 10%bonds were at 100 7/8, up 3/32; Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. 9.5% bonds for June delivery were up 2/32 at 97 31/32and June Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% bondswere trading 2/32 higher at 98 15/32.   Meanwhile, activity remained at a standstill in the marketfor high-coupon mortgage securities in the aftermath of thePublic Securities Association statement Tuesday that it willimpose trading curbs on certain high-coupon mortgage issuesthat are experiencing rapid prepayment rates.   The PSA's move is aimed at stemming the recent issuance ofabove-market mortgages, used as collateral mainly for GNMAmortgage-backed securities, that are often prepaid quickly torefinance more quickly than usual. For investors who havebeen paying premiums for those issues, expecting prepaymentto come much later, the value of their purchases has beensharply reduced.                                                                                                          Municipals                                                                                                          In a repeat performance of Wednesday's lifeless trading,most actively traded municipal bonds finished rock steadyafter barely budging all session.   &quot;It's basically a sideways market in municipals,&quot; saidLewis Nassikas, a trader at First Albany Corp. Trading, headded, was particularly light with market participantssluggish before the long Memorial Day weekend.   There was little response to the revised U.S. grossnational product data for the first quarter.   GNP was revised downward to a 1.3% annual rate from the2.1% pace originally estimated last month. Inventoryreduction was the chief reason for the revision.   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Reporthad forecast, on average, an updated first-quarter clip of1.8%.   In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's7.20% bonds of 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 in late trading,yielding 7.37%.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          A stronger yen and speculation that some banks will sooncut the prime rate triggered a modest rally in the Japanesegovernment bond market.   Japan's prime rate, a benchmark long-term loan rate, iscurrently 7.9%. The rate is set monthly by three large creditbanks, which are expected to cut the prime rate to 7.6%,effective June 1. The announcement could come as early astoday.   Japan's bond market rally was muted, however, becauseinvestors believe the Bank of Japan will continue to putupward pressure on short-term interest rates, over which thecentral bank has the most immediate influence. Economistssaid the central bank wants short-term rates to remain highin order to support the value of the yen, among other things.   Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.14 point to 87.71yesterday to yield 7.02%. (The yield is calculated in localterms, but would be much lower if calculated by thesemi-annual compound measure that is used in the U.S.)   Financial markets were closed in West Germany, France,Switzerland and Holland in observance of Ascension Day.   In Britain, where trading activity was quiet due to theholiday in other countries, government bonds ended moderatelylower.</TEXT></DOC>
