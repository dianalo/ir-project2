A University of Wisconsin food chemist, funded by Pillsbury Co., is developing a dissolvable film that keeps the dry and wet portions of a frozen food separate until the food is cooked. The film is made from cellulose, fats, beeswax and a plasticizer, all &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; for food use, according to the Food and Drug Administration.    The film could be laid over a shell of pizza dough before the wet filling is added, keeping the two apart until the frozen pizza is cooked and the film disintegrates, says the food chemist, Owen Fennema. The film, about as thick as wax paper, also could be used to keep puddinglike fillings from soaking into cakes or to prevent soggy crusts in potpies. The film has a shelf life of several months.    The film is made by hand, and Mr. Fennema's lab can produce only eight to 10 square feet of the film at a time in the tedious process. &quot;If some company is really serious about it, it'll have to determine if it can be produced in quantity,&quot; he says.    The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation in Madison is obtaining patents on the film. A spokesman for Pillsbury, which has first rights to the licenses, says it is too early for the company to decide if and how it might use the film.    Collision Alert   A new radar system for automobiles warns of impending collisions.    The system, developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, can be mounted behind the grill of a car, and its beam sweeps an area in front of the auto. A microprocessor then analyzes the returning reflections to see if any of the detected objects -- such as a road sign, a tree, an animal, a human or another car -- are on a collision course with the vehicle. If so, the machine sounds an alarm or flashes a red dashboard light to warn the driver.    At 50 miles an hour, a driver would have enough warning time -- although barely enough -- to avoid a head-on crash with an oncoming vehicle traveling 50 miles an hour, says Tom Noble, who oversees licensing of the Columbus, Ohio, institute's inventions. In more common scenarios, the warning would rouse sleepy drivers if they veered off the road or zoomed up on a slow-moving truck.    The system was made possible by Battelle's invention of a cheap way to steer radar beams in the millimeter wave bandwaves that are even shorter than microwaves and have a more limited range. A rotating drum surrounding a rodlike radar antenna steers the radar beam in the Battelle invention. Until now, only the military could afford steerable millimeter-wave radar systems, Mr. Noble says.    If a single auto maker adopted the system, it would replace the military as the largest purchaser of millimeter-wave components, Mr. Noble says. Such mass production would reduce the cost of the system to less than $1,000 apiece, he says.    The institute already has received licensing interest from auto and electronics companies in the U.S. and abroad, particularly Europe, Mr. Noble says. &quot;We got an inquiry from Scandinavia wanting to know if the system would detect moose crossing the road.&quot;    Blue Roses   A truly blue rose and cold-resistant chrysanthemums are being developed by genetic engineers.    Most so-called blue roses today are actually bluish shades of red and purple, says Jeffrey Hooper, president of Twyford International Inc., a British agricultural biotechnology company specializing in ornamental plants and vegetables. Recently, he says, Twyford scientists identified a plant gene that produces &quot;true blue&quot; flowers. The plant in which the gene was found is being kept secret for competitive reasons, Mr. Hooper says. The scientists are now determining the chemical structure of the gene before attempting to transfer it to rose plants.    Twyford, which recently opened a lab in Santa Paula, Calif., has successfully transferred a gene into chrysanthemums that enables the plants to flourish and flower at average temperatures three to five degrees lower than normal. The gene-altered mums should cut fuel bills for greenhouse growers, Mr. Hooper says. Twyford hopes to offer two varieties of cold-resistant mums to nurseries next year.    Twyford can produce thousands of genetically identical seedlings each season by growing plants from single cells cultured in the test tube, rather than from seeds or cuttings. Using this technique, the company this fall will offer U.S. growers 200,000 seedlings of 25 kinds of rhododendrons from the Rothschild family's Exbury Gardens in England. </TEXT></DOC>
