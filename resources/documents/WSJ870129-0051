Yesterday's meeting, the highest level session between ANC and Reagan administration officials, had been sharply criticized by U.S. conservatives, who view the ANC as a terrorist group dominated by communists. The State Department, seeking to show that it, too, was concerned about these issues, stressed that Mr. Shultz had made it clear that &quot;a policy of violence from any party is not the answer to South Africa's problems and that there are other options.&quot;    In its statement issued after the session, the department said that Mr. Shultz told Mr. Tambo that &quot;terrorist actions against innocent civilians are totally unacceptable.&quot;    Although both sides characterized the meeting at the State Department as &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;substantive,&quot; it was clear that each was asking the other to take steps it isn't prepared to take.    Mr. Tambo, in brief remarks to reporters before leaving the State Department, said he had asked Mr. Shultz to use his influence to get other western nations to impose economic sanctions on Pretoria's white-ruled government. Praising the economic penalties imposed by Congress last year, he said it was &quot;necessary to pursue the question of sanctions further.&quot;    However, Charles Redman, the department's spokesman, said during a briefing that followed the meeting that the administration hadn't altered its view that sanctions aren't the way to resolve South Africa's problems. &quot;It's our policy to be engaged,&quot; and a U.S. presence is a positive factor in South Africa, Mr. Redman said.    On the other hand, Mr. Tambo rejects Mr. Shultz's calls for an end to ANC violence. In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Tambo, noting that his group is outlawed in South Africa, said, &quot;if it was possible to achieve our political objectives (to end apartheid) without violence, I would renounce it.&quot; But, he added, &quot;As of now, it's not thinkable.&quot;    Mr. Tambo also told reporters that he is not a communist, although he said there are communists among the ANC's national executive committee. A recent State Department report to Congress on the extent of communist influence in South Africa estimated that &quot;roughly half&quot; of the members of the 30-member committee were known or suspected communists. The report also said that the ANC has a &quot;near-total dependence&quot; on the Soviet bloc for military assistance.    But the report also said that the South African communist party was only one element in a coalition of interests within the ANC. The report noted that &quot;African nationalism is a strong competitor with orthodox Marxism in ideological appeal.&quot;    Mr. Redman said that the meeting was part of the administration's effort to talk with all the &quot;key players&quot; in South Africa in an effort to become a broker in a negotiation process. Both the department and Mr. Tambo said they expected that talks would continue, but at a lower level. </TEXT></DOC>
