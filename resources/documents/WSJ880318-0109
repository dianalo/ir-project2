Did they also learn how to overdo it?    Based on the evidence so far, no. The stock-market crash had little cooling effect on one of the world's hottest property markets. Developers see continued need for modern space from both financial and corporate tenants, and are heartened by continued economic strength.    But the real test could be a year or two away, when a record amount of new office space comes on the market. Developers are counting on their own judgment to help them avoid a U.S.-style glut.    &quot;In America there are much bigger peaks and troughs,&quot; says Peter Kershaw, a director of Stanhope Properties PLC, one of central London's most active developers. In the United Kingdom, &quot;supply and demand is tracked by everyone,&quot; he says, predicting that developers and their financers will slow down at the first signs of uncertainty.    The appetite for shiny new high-tech office space has turned staid London into a go-go property market, and one of the world's busiest construction sites. In 1987, bulls invested #2.1 billion ($3.88 billion) in the City of London and adjacent areas, up 80% from 1986, according to Jones Lang Wootton, a major broker. In the past two years, more than one-third of the area's office space changed occupants or was replaced. Rents in the district's core jumped 50% last year. Only Tokyo costs more. &quot;We've never seen a market quite like this,&quot; says Kevin Clarke, a Jones Lang Wootton partner.    He says only a few prospective tenants deferred decisions after the October stock-market decline. Tax changes made Tuesday make it likely Britain's domestic housing market will continue to prosper, though the appreciation of expensive central London apartments has slowed.    But optimists say the crash injected the right measure of caution into the commercial market. &quot;Black Monday couldn't have happened at a better time,&quot; says Mr. Clarke. &quot;If the crash hadn't happened until May 19, 1988, we would have had an absolute disaster -- the momentum was going faster and faster.&quot;    The continuing activity is changing the City, the square mile that has served as a world commercial center since Norman times. The grand dome of St. Paul's Cathedral still dominates the skyline, and the quarter is dotted with other churches and monuments that are protected.    But planners, after years of resisting change, have bowed to the demand for space generated by &quot;Big Bang,&quot; the stock exchange's 1986 deregulation. Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., Nomura Securities Co. and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. are building European headquarters behind the facades of old landmarks. In all, Jones Lang Wootton reckons 19.7 million square feet of space, four times more new space than was leased last year, is in the works in the City and neighboring areas.    Peter Rees, the City's planning chief, claims credit for suggesting several major redevelopment projects. Decrepit warehouses, obsolete newspaper plants and ugly 1960s-era concrete buildings are coming down. Up go the sort of sleek glass-and-steel structures that would be at home in Houston or Singapore -- and are often designed by the same blue-chip American architects, such as Skidmore Owings andamp; Merrill. One project that Skidmore helped design, Broadgate, has lured half a dozen major banks, with another half-dozen buildings in the project yet to be built.    Johnson/Burgee, architect of such postmodern controversies as New York's American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. headquarters, has raised eyebrows here, too. Its design for a Kuwait Investment Office project across the river from the City imitates the Houses of Parliament -- using mirrored glass.    Prince Charles, who has emerged as a self-appointed guardian of British cities, doesn't like much of what he sees. Last year he told startled architects that German bombers had done less damage to London than the post-World War II architects and planners. &quot;You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe -- when it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble,&quot; he said. &quot;We did that.&quot;    The prince zeroed in on early proposals for the big Paternoster Square development just north of St. Paul's. &quot;This is very much the age of the computer and the word processor, but why on earth do we have to be surrounded by buildings that look like such machines?&quot; he asked. The Paternoster battle, which will be fought in planning committees later this year, promises to be spirited.    Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., the Toronto developer, this month unveils final designs for what it calls the world's largest commercial development, Canary Wharf. Its 50-story centerpiece will be Britain's tallest building. Mindful of royal sensitivities, the company hired Sir Roy Strong, former director of London's Victoria and Albert Museum, as design adviser. The #3 billion-plus complex is rising a few miles down the Thames in the Docklands development zone -- London's urban wilderness.    Canary Wharf was first envisioned as Europe's Wall Street, and drew backing and commitments to move there from Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. Olympia andamp; York is helping build a light-rail line to connect to the City. But brokers say Olympia andamp; York may end up with computer or oil companies instead of banks. With the City's more liberal planning, banks are finding space closer to the heart of their business.    Planners figure the City's cozy pubs and winding streets, after all, are one attraction of London over New York and Tokyo. They don't want frenzied development to rub out the quaintness altogether. &quot;London traditionally has been a village,&quot; says Mr. Rees, the planning chief. &quot;Villages thrive on gossip. Gossip makes money.&quot;    ---                     Space Available    Office space in City of London and adjacent districts               (In thousands of square feet)                                 DEC.'86   JUNE'87   DEC.'87    Second-hand space vacant       549       534       859    New space available            104        57       121    Under construction           1,447     3,300     3,940    Planning approval granted    9,947     8,500    11,473    Planning approval sought     5,953     9,050     8,235    Total supply pipeline       18,000    21,441    24,628    Source: Jones Lang Wotton</TEXT></DOC>
