US supercomputers have not soldwidely in Japan, partly because of the academic discount system which mayneed up to 80% off list price, and government procurement documents stillhave technical specifications that favour the incumbent Japanese suppliers;government bodies may not buy imported communications satellites if purchasesinterfere with development objectives, while US firms trying to enter theoptical fibre market in the last decade have not fared very well.andM;nipponandM;Nippon Motorola took advantage of the publicity over trade withandM;the US clarify its own stance and press for the reallocation of radio wavesin the Tokyo metropolitan area: currently it cannot sell its car telephonesin the Kanto eastern Japan region because the phones operate on bandsavailable only in Kansai area of western Japan, but Japanesetelecommunications officials claim there are no free bandwidths in thecapital city area; Nippon Motorola president Rick Younts also complained thatthe procedure for obtaining approval to expand its mobile radio servicesystem was taking far too long to complete.andM;nipponandM;Recruit Co's name may be mud for its blatant bribery ofandM;politicians, but business is business and life must go on, and the company isstill taking initiatives in the technology field, now becoming one of thefirst private companies to make use of the JCSAT Japanese satellite launchedin March, for internal company communications, investing over $4m: initially,29 of its  70 offices and branches around Japan will be linked by the system,to operate from a 6.4 metre parabola antenna on the roof of the company'sGinza headquarters.andM;nipponandM;Fujitsu Ltd has followed Amdahl Corp in launching the SunnvaleandM;company's three new 5990 IBM-compatible mainframes, the 1100, 500 and 350:the machines are offered to run IBM's MVS and VM where Fujitsu offers its own- currently less advanced in terms of the latest IBM developments - M-seriesmachines with its own OSIV/F4- MSP rewrite of MVS; the 1100 rents for adaunting $1.2m a month - Japanese computer manufacturers really sting theircustomers, but a lot of support is bundled into the price - the 350 at $480,000.andM;nipponandM;Toshiba Corp, as reported, plans to build a semiconductor plantandM;for Europe, but has not yet decided to build it alone or in conjunction witha European partner, let alone where.andM;nipponandM;The Typequick software package, from Australian Typequick Pty Ltd,andM;has found a ready market in Japan, which has come so late to keyboardingskills because the academic orientation of the  education system, thetradition of calligraphy and the difficulty of marrying the written languagewith a manageable keyboard: Typequick claims to teach people to type in 15 to20 hours, and was nominated as the best-known keyboard training course inJapan in a newspaper poll: the introduction of software-controlled romaji -Roman - to kana to kanji conversion from an English keyboard has brought downthe barriers; Typequick brought its package to Japan and converted it in1986, and has had IBM Japan as a long-time supporter - the company recentlygave Typequick its largest order, worth $1m.andM;nipponandM;The hot new 1M-bit dynamic RAM from Hitachi Ltd, announced lastandM;month (CI No 1,162), achieves its racy 35nS access time - compared with atypical 60nS for the fastest ones currently available - by applying BiCMOStechnology, using CMOS levels off- chip, but bipolar technology in criticalparts of the design; the chip has an 8-bit static column mode, and cantransfer data at up to 25Mbits-per-second; Hitachi is pitching the part atall levels of the market, from large mainframes and supercomputers toengineering workstations.andM;nipponandM;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co has launched its digital trans-PacificandM;telecommunications service following the completion last month of the thirdtrans-Pacific cable and the first fibre optic one, which will support ISDNcommunications: the cable runs from Chikura in Chiba prefecture, east ofTokyo to Hawaii, where it meets a cable from San Francisco.andM;nipponandM;Kokusai Denshin Denwa has also applied to the Ministry of Posts andamp;andM;Telecommunications for approval of an average 18% price reduction in itsinternational teleconferencing services, and has started services from theOsaka area and to three South-East Asian nations - Singapore, Hong Kong andTaiwan: rates fall to the equivalent of $606 for the first three minutes and$560 for each additional three.andM;nipponandM;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co is ready with a new 32-bitandM;personal computer for availability early next month: the dual processorPanacom M7000 Operate uses the company's proprietary MN1617X and Intel's80386, so hat it can run Matsushita's own CASII operating system and JapaneseMS-DOS: multi-tasking of up to three concurrent jobs will be supported andprices will range from $3,800 to $5,600.andM;nipponandM;Ing C Olivetti andamp; Co SpA is now getting its laptop computers fromandM;its Saitama-based Pegasus Inc joint venture with YE Data: the M111 comes witha NEC Corp V30 processor, the M211 uses an 80286 and both machines have ablue colour-base liquid crystal diode display, and memory is 640Kb to 4Mb;the Nickel Cadmium battery pack's five hour continuous operation is claimedto be the longest in the industry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
