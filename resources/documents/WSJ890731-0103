The much-heralded &quot;soft landing&quot; may include some hard knocks -- not just in the economy, but at the White House.    Economic growth so far this year has skidded to a 1.7% annual rate. And the Federal Reserve's latest forecast suggests that growth will slow further, hovering between 1% and 1.5% through the middle of next year. That's just the sort of &quot;soft landing&quot; many economists and Wall Street investors hope for.    But behind that benign-sounding expression lies a painful truth: Even a soft landing -- with its benefits of avoiding both a recession and a surge in inflation -- would inflict a lot of pain. It could throw half a million people onto the unemployment rolls, according to Data Resources Inc. It could cut $30 billion out of corporate profits. And it could shave $800 off the annual income of the average American family.    And just as important to President Bush, such a slowdown could quickly balloon the budget deficit by as much as $25 billion, threatening his &quot;read my lips&quot; campaign pledge against a tax increase.    For the White House, in short, the Fed's projection isn't good enough. With midterm congressional elections approaching and other pressures mounting, the administration needs more than a soft landing. It needs a perfect landing.    &quot;You're going to see increasing tension between the administration and the Federal Reserve,&quot; says William Niskanen, the president of the CATO Institute in Washington. &quot;This will jeopardize Bush's whole budget strategy.&quot;    Already, the tensions are evident. In public comments, White House officials have studiously avoided criticizing the Fed. Aware of the political sensitivities involved, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and other administration allies have told the White House that public pressure only makes it harder to get the Fed's independent-minded regional-bank presidents to go along with the president's wishes.    But in private, relations between Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in particular, have been severely strained by Mr. Brady's continual prodding for easier credit, officials say. Michael Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, enjoys better rapport with the Fed chairman but has also kept the heat on. President Bush himself has also weighed in with the Fed chairman on several occasions, meeting with him in the Oval Office and gently urging an easier credit policy.    If the economy slows further, the tensions are bound to multiply, and the closed-door skirmishes may turn into open battle. &quot;It may become necessary in the future to go public,&quot; one administration official confides.    The Bush team has made no secret of its view that a Fed-engineered soft landing isn't necessary to keep inflation under control. The administration's current forecast shows real growth softening only slightly, to a 2.6% pace next year, and then returning to 3%-plus in subsequent years. Mr. Boskin says such a forecast is &quot;consistent with stabilizing, and eventually falling, inflation.&quot; And Budget Director Richard Darman insists that &quot;neither a recession or a soft landing is inevitable.&quot;    But in the battle over economic policy, the Fed holds most of the cards. Administration officials have little power to influence the economy over the next year and a half, but the Fed can do a great deal by manipulating short-term interest rates. If the central bank is determined to slow economic growth to less than 2%, it can.    Indeed, many economists believe that the Fed's tight-money policies earlier this year have already set the stage for not just a soft landing but a full-fledged recession. And at least one Fed official agrees.    &quot;The next six months or so are cooked,&quot; says Fed Governor Martha Seger, who has tended to favor an easier monetary policy than most other governors. &quot;It's going to be very difficult to land the aircraft in a nice, gentle way. Instead, we may take a wing off.&quot;    Right now, one thing that seems clear is that the economy is slowing. In the second quarter, growth hit its lowest level in nearly three years. And while the White House ponders the effects on its revenue forecasts and on the 1990 congressional elections, the &quot;soft landing&quot; already looks like anything but to many Americans.    &quot;We're not going to have a recession in the technical sense, but it's going to be very unpleasant for certain key sectors and key companies,&quot; says Walter Joelson, the chief economist at General Electric Co. &quot;For many, many people, it will feel like a recession.&quot; The auto and home-building industries have already been hard hit.    Mary Rider, whose Oldsmobile dealership just outside Richmond, Va., began liquidation proceedings July 12, says as far as she's concerned, the economy is in a recession. &quot;I've been in this business for 17 years,&quot; she says, &quot;and I remember what it was like during recessions in the 1970s and early 1980s. . . . The whole scene over the last year is that people are just not buying. To get a car sold is like pulling teeth. And it's getting progressively worse.&quot;    For home builders, says Geoffrey Brunning, an Atlanta contractor, &quot;It's terrible. It seems to me like a very hard landing. I think we may have broken the undercarriage.&quot; Hand-lettered signs posted by homeowners in Atlanta tell the story: &quot;Owner must sell. . . . Desperate. . . . Will consider any offer.&quot;    And as some major employers begin to retrench, the secondary effects are already taking hold. In Framingham, Mass., the closing of a General Motors factory this week has deprived the town of more than 1,500 jobs. &quot;They were by far the largest employer,&quot; says Edgar Gadbois, the town administrator. &quot;And it does have spillover effects. Our local revenues are already beginning to decline. We have fewer building permits. There's definitely a slowdown.&quot;    The term &quot;soft landing&quot; is a recent invention. Economists argue about what it means and whether it has ever happened in the past. The closest parallel, says Roger Brinner of Data Resources, occurred in 1967, when the economy slowed down significantly but avoided a downturn. During that Vietnam War period, defense spending helped bolster the economy, Mr. Brinner contends -- just as continued growth in exports, he believes, will help the economy in the coming slowdown.    But in the end, when it comes down to distinguishing 1% growth from a mild recession, &quot;you'd be straining at gnats to tell the difference,&quot; says Robert Black, the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.    However, to an administration facing automatic Gramm-Rudman spending cuts and Democrats intent on making the economy a political issue, every percentage point of growth counts. And the maneuvers that spell the difference between the Fed's forecast and the administration's occur mostly inside the Fed's marble headquarters in Washington.    Fed policy makers started pushing up interest rates in the spring of last year to head off rising fears of inflation and to cool a rapidly growing economy. They worried that as unemployment dropped and factory operating rates rose, the economy would quickly run out of growing room. Between March 1988 and May 1989, the central bank's credit squeeze pushed short-term interest rates up more than three percentage points.    In early June, however, the Fed reversed course. After a harsh internal debate against the backdrop of a slowing economy, policy makers voted to ease their grip on credit. They eased again in early July and then again just last week. Now, the key interest rate on federal funds, the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other, has dropped to about 9% from 9 3/4% in May.    Because the effects of the Fed's actions usually take months to work their way through the economy, the economic outlook for the next six months has largely been determined by credit-policy moves already taken. Similarly, the current easing probably won't have much effect until 1990. &quot;Whatever we do now,&quot; Ms. Seger says, &quot;I don't think it will affect the rest of the year very much.&quot;    In the past, episodes of rising interest rates have often been followed by recessions. The usual sequence of events: As the economic expansion ages, inflation begins to accelerate. The Federal Reserve responds by pushing up rates to rein in inflation. But, unable to foresee the future, the Fed makes a &quot;mistake,&quot; pushes too far and squeezes the economy into recession.    This time, however, a surprisingly diverse group of economists believes that the all-too-familiar story may not repeat itself. &quot;I don't see the concatenation of things we usually see before a recession,&quot; says Paul McCracken, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He notes in particular that business inventories, which often build up as over-optimistic businessmen stock up at a business-cycle peak, &quot;don't seem to be all that much out of line with sales.&quot; That's significant, he says, because high inventories often cause businessmen to cut off new orders at the onset of a recession, deepening the slide.    In fact, some analysts believe that the economy may be less prone to recessions than in the past. For one thing, &quot;inventory swings are much less important in the economy than they used to be,&quot; Mr. Niskanen says. Two major reasons: the increasing importance of service industries, which don't have large inventories, and the improved, computerized techniques of inventory management, which may help companies avoid excessive buildups.    Fed Governor Wayne Angell also argues that global competition makes recessions less likely. &quot;The U.S. economy today is characterized by industries and firms that can no longer plan as if they are dominant leaders in those markets,&quot; he says. &quot;It has become a world marketplace.&quot;    The result, Mr. Angell contends, is that companies that would have cut output in reaction to a downturn 10 or 20 years ago now will cut prices instead. So, the downturn may be gentler and its effect in controlling inflation greater. </TEXT></DOC>
