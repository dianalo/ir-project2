U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter set bail Thursday over theobjections of prosecutors who maintained that former DrugEnforcement Administration agent John Jackson was a risk to flee.   Jackson, 40, of Claremont, could be released as soon as nextweek from the downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center. Hehas been in custody since his Nov. 22, 1988 arrest.   Jackson and two other former DEA agents, Darnell Garcia, 42, ofRancho Palos Verdes, and Wayne Countryman, 46, of Walnut, werecharged in a 42-count indictment with trafficking cocaine andheroin and laundering the proceeds through banks in Switzerland andLuxembourg.   Jackson's wife, Barbara, 41, and a former business partner,Sherman Lair, 39, of Alta Loma, also were charged.   Hatter ordered Jackson to be electronically monitored if he goesfree and to seek permission from parole officers to leave his homefor a doctor's visit or an emergency.   Monitoring usually is done through a bracelet locked to thewearer's ankle or wrist that emits a coded electronic signal.   Jackson's lawyer, Terry Amdur, said his client was confined tothe special housing unit at the downtown Metropolitan DetentionCenter, an area reserved for problem prisoners or arrested lawenforcement officers who cannot safely mix with inmates.   Garcia, a fugitive for seven months, was arrested in Luxembourgin July. He was sentenced to six months in jail by a Belgium courtfor a passport violation, and U.S. authorities have requested hisextradition when his term ends in a few weeks.   The trial for all the defendants has been scheduled for April.</TEXT></DOC>
