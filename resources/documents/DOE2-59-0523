Both latitudinallimits to a species' distribution over a large area and availabilityof suitable habitat on the local scale may be altered by climate change.Average temperatures are expected to rise globally, and rainfall is expectedto decrease in middle and increase in high latitudes in the next century.This paper uses the anadromous and landlocked stocks of striped bassto illustrate the possible effects of climate change on fish distribution.The tenuous existence of striped bass along the northern coast of theGulf of Mexico and in Florida will likely be jeopardized by regionalwarming and reduced streamflow in the rivers in which these fish reside.In many freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries, the existing summerconstriction of suitable habitat by high temperatures and low oxygenconcentrations may be aggravated by warming, altered streamflow, andincreased hypoxia. An expansion of the species' range around Nova Scotiaand in the Gulf of St. Lawrence may occur, although the cold LabradorCurrent may strengthen and cancel any potential water temperature increases.Our understanding of the habitat requirements of highly visible fishspecies exceeds our confidence in climate models, but will allow forecastsof changes in regional and local habitat suitability as climate understandingand forecasting improve. 45 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
