A panel of judges on Monday ordered that all the pendingasbestos personal-injury cases in federal courts nationwidebe transferred to U.S. District Judge Charles Weiner inPhiladelphia.                                                                                                          Other than pulling the cases into one district, the orderdoesn't address how the litigation will be handled.   But for now, the only thing definite, according to manyplaintiffs' attorneys, is that thousands of cases previouslyset for trial in courts around the nation are likely to bedelayed while a new procedure is developed. &quot;We just entereda dark tunnel, and there's no light on the train and there'sno light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; said Shepard Hoffman, aplaintiffs' attorney in Baltimore.   Fred Baron, a plaintiffs' attorney in Dallas, predictedthat for many of his clients, the consolidation order &quot;willmean more delay, and for no reason -- the only reason is thatthis is a politically charged matter. . . . {The judges} arelooking for a quick fix to a problem that doesn't have aquick fix.&quot;   Judge Weiner couldn't be reached for comment. Lawyers forformer asbestos manufacturers declined to comment. Nohearings have yet been scheduled on the consolidated asbestoscases.   The growing number of asbestos cases has increasinglyalarmed judges, who say that in many districts the cases haveswamped court dockets. Asbestos, once widely used as aninsulator and in shipbuilding, can cause cancer and otherserious illnesses as long as 40 years after exposure. As manyas 200,000 deaths from asbestos are expected by the year2000, according to a study cited by the judges.   In deciding to consolidate all the federal cases, thejudges hope to find a more efficient way to handle the cases.&quot;This litigation,&quot; the panel of judges said, &quot;has reached amagnitude . . . that threatens the administration of justiceand that requires a new, streamlined approach.&quot;   The panel conceded in its order that consolidation won'tbe a panacea. Plaintiffs and defendants have presented widelydivergent views of how the consolidated cases should behandled, and Judge Weiner faces a huge task in reconcilingthem. Some attorneys have speculated that Judge Weiner willconsolidate preliminary work on the cases, then send themback to other districts for actual trials. Others have saidthat Judge Weiner could push many of the cases towardsettlement.   State courts, which already account for two thirds of thenation's 90,000 asbestos personal-injury cases, aren'taffected by the federal consolidation order. But a group ofstate judges from across the country who handle asbestoslitigation have been in contact with Judge Weiner, and thegroup is scheduled to meet Aug. 16 in Minneapolis to discussthe federal measure.   The state judges also are considering their owninitiatives in asbestos cases, such as trying to encourageuniform damage awards and ordering plaintiffs' claims basedon the seriousness of the victims' condition.   One of the judges, New York State Judge Helen Freedman ofManhattan, said the state judges are concerned that,depending on how Judge Weiner proceeds, the consolidationcould result in an influx of new state cases, as lawyersrealize they may get faster or more favorable treatmentoutside the federal system. &quot;Judge Weiner is very cognizantof this,&quot; Judge Freedman said. &quot;He has been very eager tocoordinate with us on the state courts' problems.&quot;   Louis Robles, a plaintiffs' attorney in Miami, said thatJudge Weiner's actions over the next few months willdetermine whether plaintiffs increase their state-courtsuits. &quot;Anything that has the effect of streamlining thelitigation process is good for my clients,&quot; Mr. Robles said.&quot;But the proof is in the pudding.&quot;   ---   LANDOWNERS SEEK PAYMENT from US Sprint for use of land forcables.   In the late 1980s, US Sprint Communications Co. installedapproximately 230 miles of fiber-optic cable beside railroadtracks in Tennessee. At the time, the company agreed to paySouthern Railway Co., a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp., arailroad holding company based in Norfolk, Va., $6.9 millionover 25 years for use of the right-of-way.   Now, however, the Tennessee Supreme Court has agreed todecide whether US Sprint must also pay property owners inAnderson County. They argue that Southern Railroad'sright-of-way over their land doesn't allow the railroad toextend that right to US Sprint, a telecommunications companybased in Kansas City, Mo.   Some lawyers say that if the Tennessee court rules againstUS Sprint and other state courts follow suit, it could raisethe costs of installing long-distance networks. &quot;It is veryhard to assemble rights-of-way today,&quot; said Marc Machlin, ofthe Washington, D.C., office of Pepper, Hamilton andamp; Scheetz.&quot;The existence of these railroad rights of way&quot; made iteasier for long-distance companies like Sprint &quot;to get intobusiness,&quot; he said.   Such rights-of-way were commonly granted by legislaturesin the 19th century so that railroads could lay track acrossproperty they didn't own. In most states, includingTennessee, subsequent legislation was also passed thatallowed telephone companies to put phone lines on privateproperty, including railroad property.   But earlier this year a lower court in Tennessee ruledthat installing fiber-optic cable creates such an additionalburden on property rights that the landowners are entitled tocompensation from US Sprint. That ruling prompted the statehigh-court review.   ---   BIG-FIRM DALLAS LITIGATORS to form new small firm.
