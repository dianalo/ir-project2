The situation has all the makings of a liquidity crisis as Sandamp;Ls desperate for cash bid up interest rates they pay for large, &quot;hot money&quot; deposits. Such deposits are purchased on the national money markets and are much more apt to be withdrawn than retail deposits placed by consumers.    To get money during the past few weeks, those thrifts with adequate collateral have increased their borrowings from the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank and they are drawing down their excess cash reserves on deposit at the federal bank.    &quot;Asset problems,&quot; or bad loans, are &quot;becoming secondary to a liquidity crisis,&quot; H. Joe Selby, an executive vice president of the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank, told Texas thrift executives at an annual convention here. &quot;A liquidity crisis can't be managed,&quot; he added, the way regulators can help thrifts sort through problems in their loan portfolios.    &quot;The situation continues to deteriorate as I talk to you,&quot; George M. Barclay, an executive vice president at the Dallas federal bank told the meeting. He cited examples of pension funds and other large customers that have decided to pull their money from Texas Sandamp;Ls, or who are thinking about it.    The regulators say their fear is that rising interest rates paid by the Sandamp;Ls will put many thrifts deeper into debt and further raise the cost of the multibillion-dollar bailout regulators assert is needed for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to restore the industry to health.    Congress is debating different measures that call for either $5 billion or $7.5 billion in funds to the FSLIC, but Mr. Barclay said that as much as $4 billion is needed now -- just at the Dallas federal bank.    Federal regulators say the Texas situation has worsened since March after the FSLIC was forced to provide $1 billion in cash to the Dallas federal bank to support FSLIC-backed loans to troubled thrifts that were under-collateralized. Since then, Mr. Barclay said, a bad liquidity situation in Texas has worsened.    Besides that, there have been several well-publicized failures of Texas Sandamp;Ls in recent weeks and skittish depositors are pulling their money out of these and other institutions.    Mr. Selby said, &quot;I wouldn't call it a run. I'd call it a gradual and persistent withdrawal of jumbo deposits&quot; which, he added, in some cases are made up of large and small amounts.    The money shortage, Mr. Barclay said, has resulted in a 23% increase in thrifts taking deposits put together by brokers at interest rates offering a premium of as much as 225 basis points over interest rates paid by thrifts outside Texas. He said the so-called Texas premium is double the amount that cash-strapped thrifts had been paying less than 90 days ago.    For example, he said Texas Sandamp;Ls are paying as much as 9.5% for 90-day certificates of deposit while thrifts outside the state are paying as much as 7.5% for such deposits.    Also, Mr. Barclay said that about $1.6 billion in cash reserves that thrifts held on account at the Dallas federal bank was withdrawn in May. And last month, the bank had a record 190 thrifts in the Southwest borrowing funds. Those withdrawals, he said he presumed, were to meet liquidity needs.    To help stop the outflow at the Dallas federal bank, Mr. Barclay said that last month it raised the interest rate it pays on overnight deposits from thrifts to 10 basis points over the federal funds rate, or the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight.    The Dallas federal bank also is trying to attract funds to the state from savings and loan associations that have excess cash. The idea is that regulators would broker deposits from stronger thrifts to the weaker ones in an attempt to reduce interest rates paid by the cash-hungry Texas institutions.    So far, about $350 million is being channeled from the healthier institutions to the weaker ones, Mr. Barclay said. Institutions in Oklahoma and Kansas are helping provide some of the funds, he said. But the program, begun in March, is too small now to relieve the liquidity problems in a major way, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
