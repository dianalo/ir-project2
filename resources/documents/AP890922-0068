BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of Texas bank closings this year hastied last year's total and more failures are on the way, expertssaid.   Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield closed RoseCapital Bank in Tyler on Thursday, the 113th failure this year.   Analysts said more closings are on the way, perhaps as a slowerpace, as the industry continues to suffer from the real estate andenergy depressions.   ``I had projected earlier in the year that we would likely have100 independent bank failures,'' Littlefield said. He noted that the113 include more than 44 from two large bank-holding companies.   ``We believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in thenumber of independently chartered banks that fail,'' Littlefieldsaid, predicting about 80 next year.   ``We will continue to have bank failures for two more years'' asa result of past lending decisions, Littlefield said.   ``The worst is behind Texas banks,'' said Sandy Flannigan, aHouston-based analyst for PaineWebber Inc.   Nationally, the numbers should remain about the same next year,according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. in Washington, D.C.   Rose Capital was the 160th failure this year in the country, saidWhitney, who noted that 10 banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981and ``we thought it was Armageddon.''   Since then, the numbers have grown each year: 42 in 1982, 48 in'83, 80 in '84, 120 in '85, 138 in '86, 184 in '87 and 200 last year.   The failures will continue, Whitney said, ``even though theeconomy in Texas and other parts of the Southwest has begun tostabilize somewhat because changes in the banking industry alwayslag from 18 months to 24 months.''   Littlefield said Rose Capital was closed because ``asset qualityproblems and resulting losses ... attributed to the area's pooreconomic condition.''   The bank, which had assets of $64.6 million and deposits of about$61.1 million, was purchased by First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc.for $25,000.   First City will also purchase about $46.4 million of RoseCapital's assets.   The FDIC will provide $16.8 million in assistance, and retainassets with a book value of $18.2 million. The bank was to reopentoday.</TEXT></DOC>
