On the second day of the Arab summit, Hussein disclaimed anyambition to restore Jordanian rule in the Israeli-occupied WestBank. He insisted that the PLO must represent the Palestinianpeople at any future international peace conference.   Speaking behind closed doors to the leaders of the PLO and 20Arab nations, Hussein endorsed some aspects of Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz's Middle East peace plan, but declared:   ``The United States has no Middle East policy other than supportfor Israel. The U.S. approach to the problem of the Arab-Israeliconflict is, unfortunately, based on a policy of crisis-management.   ``The United States takes no political steps or initiativesunless there has been a recent eruption in the region taking on theaspect of a war.''   Hussein said Arab nations should support the Palestinianuprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ``in an organized andeffective manner and ensure that it continues until it achieves itsobjectives.''   Copies of Hussein's comments were made available by theJordanian delegation.   Hussein, who has been lukewarm in his support for the PLO in thepast, repeatedly stressed his wholehearted acceptance of theguerrilla organization as ``the sole legitimate representative ofthe Palestinian people.''   The three-day Arab League meeting was convened to support thePalestinian uprising, which began in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip Dec. 8.   In Jerusalem today, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres mockedthe Arab leaders for supporting the uprising. ``There is nothingmore fractious for the Arab people than their show of unity,'' hesaid.   ``Are they really united around the intefadeh?'' Peres asked inparliament, using the Arabic word for uprising. ``Do they mean tosay Iran and Iraq are fighting a war over the intefadeh and that inLebanon all the factions are also fighting over the intefadeh? Whatkind of show is this?''   PLO leader Yassir Arafat, wearing his usual ``kefiyeh''headscarf and battle fatigues, told the Arab leaders on Tuesdaythat ``our people swear before you to continue the struggle and theintefadeh until victory.''   He reiterated the PLO's determination to create a sovereignPalestinian state ``with Jerusalem as its capital.'' Israel hasproclaimed Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state and pledgednever to give up any part of it.   The summit's opening session Tuesday was marked by the walkoutof the Iranian ambassador to Algeria. Algerian newspapers carriedmany pages of detailed coverage of the summit, but there was nomention of the Iranian ambassador's walkout.   The ambassador, Zargar Yaghoubi, abruptly rose from his seat inthe diplomats' section and walked out of the hall during an addressby Chedli Klibi, Tunisian Secretary General of the Arab League.   ``While speaking on the intefadeh for which we meet we cannotignore the victory of brother Iraq, which has recovered itsterritories, notably the Faw peninsula,'' Klibi said.   ``Iraq has always been prepared to cooperate with internationalpeace efforts, while Iran's leaders are determined to pursue thewar'' which increasingly threatens neighboring Saudi Arabia andKuwait, Klibi declared.   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy confirmed that Yaghoubiwalked out of the opening session ``in protest against incorrectstatements'' on the 7-year-old Persian Gulf war.   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is one of the few top Arableaders not present at the summit. He sent a high-level delegation,but said he was too busy with the war to come to Algiers.   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip fromEgypt in the June 1967 Six-Day War. Since anti-Israeli riots beganon Dec. 8, more than 200 Palestinians and two Israelis have beenkilled.</TEXT></DOC>
