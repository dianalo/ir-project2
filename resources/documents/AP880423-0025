Price Remembered As Advocate For Military, Servant ToConstituents</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Melvin Price, an Illinois Democratelected in the waning days of World War II who rose to second inHouse seniority, was remembered at his death as a loyal servant tohis constituents and a strong advocate for the nation's military.   Price, 83, died Friday of cancer at Malcolm Grove Hospital atAndrews Air Force Base. He was serving his 22nd term in Congress, atenure surpassed only by 24-term Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Mass.   Price, who had announced two years ago this would be his lastterm in the House, for 10 years chaired the chamber's ArmedServices Committee. He was ousted from that post in January 1985 byyounger Democrats seeking a more vigorous watchdog on the Reaganadministration's military policies.   During his tenure as head of the committee, Price had presidedover the drive to beef up the nation's arms stockpile with the MXmissile, the B-1 bomber, a nuclear aircraft carrier and a vastarray of other hardware.   A proposed amendment to the Pentagon budget bill pending in theHouse would name a new Trident missile-firing submarine for Price.   He considered himself a staunch supporter of administrationrequests for military spending regardless of which party was inpower, acknowledging the committee under his aegis was somewhat ofa ``rubber stamp'' for the Pentagon.   ``In many ways, it is,'' Price once said. ``I'd rather becriticized for being for something than have to alibi when we needit and we don't have it.''   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who replaced Price as chairman of ArmedServices, called him ``a fair, evenhanded, thoughtful member'' with``a quiet grace that will be missed around Congress.''   Price had suffered in recent years from arthritis and diabetes,and learned in the last month that he had pancreatic cancer, saidadministrative assistant Mike Mansfield. He went to the hospitalearly Friday complaining of pain and died in the early evening.   Price, who had been a sports writer in the 1920s, grew up alongthe banks of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis. He came toCongress as an aide at the start of the New Deal and won electionwhile serving as an enlisted man in the Army.   He took office in 1945, as the Red Army was closing in on AdolphHitler's bunker.   Illinois' two Democratic senators said Price's impact on hisstate and on the nation's military would continue.   ``Mel Price was a man of the people who kept a common touchafter reaching great heights. He moved from being an Army corporalto contributing in a major way to the nation's defense,'' said Sen.Paul Simon.   Sen. Alan Dixon said Price ``had absolutely no peer in serviceto his constituency. He was my mentor and close personal friend. Mydeepest sympathies are with his wife today.''   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, a Republican, said, ``Mel Pricededicated his life to serving the people of southwestern Illinois,and he became one of the most powerful people in Congress.   ``The people of his district will miss Representative Price, butthe evidence of his dedication is clearly visible throughout thetowns and villages of that area,'' Thompson said.   Price, himself a victim of ouster from the Armed Services panelby younger lawmakers, first was selected to chair the panel in 1974when junior lawmakers rebelled against Rep. F. Edward Herbert,D-La., whom they considered too autocratic.   He continued to serve as chairman of the panel's research anddevelopment subcommittee even after his ouster from the committee'stop position, but in his later years suffered from severe arthritiswhich forced him to inch his way across Capitol Hill and miss somelegislative business due to hospitalization.   Price in 1986 survived a four-way primary battle to win hisparty's nomination, and defeated his GOP challenger by just 943votes, his smallest margin of victory.   In Illinois, Madison County Clerk Evelyn Bowles, said Gov. JamesR. Thompson has five days from the death to call for a specialelection, which would must be held within 115 days of thegovernor's call.   Price is survived by his wife, Garaldine, and one son, Dr.William Price of Colorado Springs, Colo.</TEXT></DOC>
