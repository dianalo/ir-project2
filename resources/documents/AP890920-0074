We accept that time is of the essence and we are committed tovisible evolutionary progress ... While we are quite prepared to betested against our undertakings, we cannot accept responsibility forover-enthusiastic or even twisted versions of our policy.   For years progress was hampered by, among others, lack ofcooperation, suspicion and mistrust. And, as critics of thegovernment would surely want to allege, also by actions and-orfailures on the side of the government...   The time has come for South Africa to restore its pride and tolift itself out of the doldrums of growing international isolation,economic decline and increasing polarization...   During the term of the new government we shall concentrateespecially on five crucial areas:   _We shall set everything in motion to bridge the deep gulf ofmistrust, suspicion and fear between South Africans ...   _The negotiation process will, from the start, receive incisiveattention...   _We are going to open the door to prosperity and economic growth.We shall do this by breaking out of the international strangleholdwhich, for political reasons, has been applied to our growthpotential...   _We are going to develop a new constitutional dispensation inwhich everyone will be able to participate without domination.   _We shall continue to deal with unrest, violence and terrorismwith a firm hand ...   _We shall work urgently on proposals with regard to the handlingof discriminatory legislation. The continued removal ofdiscrimination remains an important objective ...   _We shall work just as urgently on the formulation of alternativemethods of protecting group and minority rights in anon-discriminatory manner. This includes urgent attention to theplace and role of a human rights bill...   _The process of the release of security prisoners, which wasstarted by my predecessor, will be continued ...   My call to the international community is: take note of what ishappening in South Africa. There is a determination amongst millionsof South Africans to negotiate fair and peaceful solutions. Use yourinfluence constructively to help us attain that goal ...   And to the the leaders and the people of South Africa my appealis: help me and the government to make a breakthrough to peace.</TEXT></DOC>
