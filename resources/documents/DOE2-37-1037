The study assessesDistrict Heating and Cooling (DHC) and develops a conceptual districtsystem for Salt Lake City. In assessing District Heating and Coolingin Salt Lake City, the system conceived is evaluated to determine whetherit is technically and economically viable. To determine technical viability,aspects such as implementation, pipe routing, and environmental restrictionsare reviewed to foresee any technical problems that would arise as aresult of DHC. To determine economic feasibility, the conceived systemis priced to determine the capital cost to construct, and modeled inan economic analysis using anticipated operating and fuel costs to producethe required revenue necessary to run the system. Technical and Economicfeasibility are predicated on many variables, including heating and coolingload, pipe routing, system implementation, and fuel costs. These variableshave been investigated and demonstrate a substantial potential for DHCin Salt Lake City. Areas of consideration include the Downtown Area,Metropolitan Hall of Justice and surrounding area, and the Hotel District.</TEXT></DOC>
