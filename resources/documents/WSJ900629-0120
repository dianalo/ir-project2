But what if the better Russians don't want tobe bailed out by the West?   Wandering around this city-that-doesn't-work (Manila onthe Moscow) this week, I put the question of Western aid to avariety of reformers. Politicians, journalists, economists --these are the people who want to go beyond Mr. Gorbachev'sinchoate reforms to create private property and democraticpolitics. They are the ones who will have to prevail ifRussia (&quot;U.S.S.R.&quot; will soon be passe) is ever going to jointhe civilized, developed world. Aid for Gorby? Every singlereformer is ambivalent at the very least, and usuallyflat-out opposed.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Sometimes I think the worst enemies of democracy in mycountry are democrats in the West,&quot; says Ilya Zaslavsky, amember of the reformist Interregional Group of Deputies inthe Soviet parliament. &quot;You are always trying to help ourdictatorship.&quot; Mr. Zaslavsky is slight, has hair that isearly-Beatles and like most Russians has a well honed giftfor irony.   But his view is hardly eccentric. I couldn't find a singlereformer, moderate or radical, who endorsed Western help totoday's Kremlin. The current system is understood as a blackhole.   ---   Andrei Anikin, a prominent economist, figures thegovernment wasted $200 billion during the oil-price boom ofthe 1970s. Alexander Bogomolov, a young establishmenteconomist (his father, Oleg, is an adviser to Boris Yeltsin),says the Gorbachev regime has already squandered billions inrecent loans from West Germany.   &quot;In the current structure, aid is useless,&quot; says Mr.Bogomolov. &quot;We have no economic or political mechanisms thatwould let us use it effectively.&quot; The elder Bogomolov tellsmy colleague Peter Gumbel he feels the same way.   Of course, the more seductive argument is that Western aidwould somehow leverage free-market reform. Some reformers arewilling to try this, though less to assist Mr. Gorbachev thanto twist his arm. Mr. Anikin, despairing of any new Gorbachevideas for at least another year, wants the InternationalMonetary Fund or the United Nations (]) to more or lessdictate reform. Mr. Bogomolov hopes the West will treateconomic reform the way it has arms control -- negotiatingSoviet concessions. Still others agree that the Kremlin ishopeless, but would welcome aid to the newly democratic localgovernments in such cities as Leningrad and Moscow.   But the difficulties are obvious. Do Americans really wantto take credit for raising prices for bread and rent? This isalso not a banana republic case of selling a few hundredstate enterprises; the entire country is a state enterprise.The Soviet parliament recently spent three days deciding that&quot;individual&quot; (though, strangely, not &quot;private&quot;) property isall right, but land must still be owned by the state. As foraiding cities, it's hard to imagine George Bush or HelmutKohl telling Mr. Gorbachev they're going to write checks tohis political rivals in Leningrad.   A visit with a budding Russian &quot;capitalist&quot; isn'treassuring, either. Igor Grishenko is blond, only 31 yearsold and claims to make 3,500 rubles a month (the Sovietaverage is some 240). He runs a Moscow &quot;cooperative,&quot; theonly kind of legal private enterprise. But his clients arestate ministries, he had to buy his building from city halland he neatly dodges a question about political payoffs. Inany case, even Mr. Grishenko says, &quot;we can do without&quot;foreign subsidy.   The reformers' best point is more political than economic,going to the heart of what they call their 73-year-old&quot;insanity.&quot; Western liberals approach the Soviet Union asjust another repair job: Change the carburetor and sparkplugs and it'll be back on the road again. Reform thecurrency to mop up the &quot;ruble overhang&quot; and everyone will bein business.   ---   Russian reformers know better. Over and over again avisitor hears from reformers that they long to live in a&quot;normal&quot; society. They know their system now is abnormal,absurd. It nurtures a culture of bribery. (Anecdote: Afive-minute phone call to the U.S. costs $50, but the hoteloperator appears in a guest's room at 5 a.m. to say it willcost only $25 -- if you pay her then in greenbacks.) Theft isencouraged; work is punished.   As Yuri Shekochikhin, another reformer in the parliament,puts it: &quot;We have two economies -- a corrupt official one,and a quick, efficient one that's illegal. Why don't welegalize the black one?&quot; He answers his own question: Becausethe corrupt system exists to sustain the power of thecommunist &quot;nomenklatura&quot;. The Party still owns 95% of themeans of production. &quot;We must change this oligarchicalsystem,&quot; adds Mr. Zaslavsky. &quot;This one knows how to eat, butnot how to produce.&quot; Foreign aid in this system will dolittle more than increase the velocity of the bribes.   It's probably true that this is exactly what the Germansintend, and they don't much care. Chancellor Kohl wants topay a ransom for German unification and to keep Gorby frommeddling in German elections later this year. The &quot;dirigiste&quot;French also like ideas that enhance their internationalinfluence while spending other people's money. But the U.S.has other priorities. George Bush once said he didn't want tojeopardize Soviet reform by &quot;doing dumb things -- that's mycautious approach.&quot; Here's his chance to prove it.</TEXT></DOC>
