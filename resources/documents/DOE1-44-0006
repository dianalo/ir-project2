Asensitivity study was carried out to compare the importance of theseimpacts for the behaviour of fluxes and pools in biosphere, atmosphereand ocean. The Osnabruck Biosphere Model, a regionalized carbon fluxmodel for the terrestrial biosphere, was coupled with a box diffusionocean model and a one-box atmosphere model. A regional land use patternwas derived from the World Atlas of Agriculture. Its dynamics were introducedusing data of global land use changes. For the simulation of climaticvariations, standardized changed levels as well as gradients of temperatureand precipitation were used. In the period 1860-1981, land-use changesand the CO/sb2/ fertilization effects are similarly important and roughlyamount to 4/5 of the fossil source. Effects of potential climatic fluctuationsmay not exceed 1/5 of that amount.</TEXT></DOC>
