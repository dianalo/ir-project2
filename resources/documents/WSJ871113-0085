Kenneth F. Tempero, chairman and chief executive officer of the biotechnology concern, said animal research accounts for about two-thirds of Molecular Genetics business and the cutback will mean substantial staff reductions. Molecular Genetics employs about 135 people.    He said the company will focus on its hybrid-corn research-and-development program and will consider new business areas, including human health-care products, to generate near-term revenue.    In the third quarter, Molecular Genetics had a loss of $1 million compared with a loss of $598,000 for the year-earlier period. Sales dropped 16% for the quarter to $2.1 million from $2.5 million a year ago.    In national over-the-counter trading, Molecular Genetics closed at $3.75 a share, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
