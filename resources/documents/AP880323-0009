In testimony before a joint hearing of two House Foreign Affairssubcommittees, representatives from the Departments of State,Defense, Commerce and Treasury maintained that the toughersanctions currently before Congress would not speed up the end ofapartheid.   Charles W. Freeman Jr., deputy assistant secretary of state forAfrican affairs, warned that proposed new sanctions, including atotal investment and trade embargo, would ``play into the hands ofthe white and black extremists who seek our departure from SouthAfrica.   ``We have to decide whether the United States will continue tobe involved in the struggle to end apartheid peacefully or whetherwe will become more and more irrelevant,'' he added.   The Pretoria government has moved toward ``the brink ofwholesale authoritarianism and international isolation,'' sinceCongress overrode the president's veto on the first U.S. sanctionsin 1986, Freeman said.   He maintained that this has weakened U.S. influence there andthreatens to curtail other U.S. assistance to apartheid victims.   But Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Cal, said that to be true to its owndemocratic standards, the United States ``cannot be in bed in somefashion with the evil and the horror and the oppression of SouthAfrica.''   He is the author of legislation calling for a total ban on U.S.investment and trade with South Africa as well as cooperation inmilitary and intelligence affairs. His is one of five bills callingfor stricter sanctions aginst South Africa.   Dellums said existing sanctions permitted ``back door'' U.S.financing of the South African government and economy and that U.S.firms were paying much more in South African taxes than forprojects to uplift the black community.   James B. Kelley, deputy assistant secretary of commerce, notethat that U.S. firms in South Africa had decreased from 320 in 1984to 127 today, and insisted that what little U.S. influence is leftwill be lost if the remaining firms are forced out.   Calling the proposed legislation ``nonsensical and destructive,Assistant Treasury Secretary Robert A. Cornell said the measureswould `` harm the interests of the non-white population'' byreducing their opportunities, while expanding the economic power ofthe South African whites.   Barring U.S. exports and oil companies from operating in SouthAfrica would cost U.S. jobs but not hurt South Africa because othersuppliers would step in, Cornell said.      cyc</TEXT></DOC>
