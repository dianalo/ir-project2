Guerrillas claim more than 100 people may have been killed inlatest fighting for Afghanistan's third largest city, where theinsurgents launched an offensive nearly two weeks ago. The claimcould not be independently confirmed.   Radio stations controlled by two guerrilla groups based inPakistan said the bombardment Thursday night occurred north, eastand south of Jalalabad.   The casualties included civilians and combatants on both sides,said Quribar Rehman Saeed of the guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency.   ``They were bombing so heavy they don't care about their ownsoldiers,'' he said of the Afghan pilots.   Saeed said Afghan soldiers died in the bombardment because theopposing forces were fighting at close quarters. ``They areface-to-face,'' he said.   The Soviet news agency Tass on Thursday quoted military officialsin Kabul, the Afghan capital, as saying 4,500 guerrillas have diedand more than 2,000 have been wounded since the insurgents launchedtheir Jalalabad offensive March 6. Guerrilla spokesmen put theirlosses at 200 dead and 700 wounded.   The Afghan military has not released its casualty figures.   The guerrillas reportedly captured Jalalabad's biggest garrisonand penetrated the airport perimeter before the fighting reached astalemate.   The Jalalabad offensive is the first the guerrillas have launchedsince the Soviets completed their troop withdrawal from Afghanistanlast month.   The fall of Jalalabad, 80 miles east of Kabul and 40 miles fromthe Pakistan border, would be a major blow to the Soviet-backedAfghan government. The city is strategic because it is on the mainhighway from Pakistan to Kabul.   Soviet officials said they resumed airlifting arms and ammunitionto Kabul on Wednesday in response to the guerrilla offensive.   Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Afghan army claimed it killed 59guerrillas, including two foreign military advisers, in fighting inHerat and Kandahar provinces, the Soviet news agency Tass reportedtoday.   The report, which did not say when the fighting occurred, saidthe Afghan army only lost four men.   Moscow and Kabul also accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of itstroops to help direct the onslaught by an estimated 14,000 Moslemguerrillas. They also claimed Pakistani troops were mobilizing maleAfghan refugees, some just teen-agers, to join the fight.   Pakistan's Foriegn Ministry called the claims ``fictitious.''   Pakistan and the United States have been the insurgents' primarymilitary backers in their 11-year war to establish an Islamicrepublic of Afghanistan.   Afghanistan has complained repeatedly that Pakistan has thousandsof its military men backing up the guerrillas.   Tass also quoted Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan Yuli Vorontsovon Friday as saying Afghanistan's armed forces have shown since theSoviet withdrawal that ``they are prepared and able to uphold bythemselves, without our military participation, the country'ssovereignty.''   The State Department accused Moscow of seeking to rewrite historyafter Vorontsov said Thursday that the United States is to blame forthe fighting and that U.S. support of the guerrillas is ``immoral.''   Vorontsov's charges ``are not going to cause the world communityto forget that the Soviets occupied and invaded Afghanistan (in1979) or the continuing Soviet effort to prop up the discreditedregime in Kabul,'' spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington.   Also Friday, an Afghan guerrilla leader in Iran said theresistance groups in Pakistan should give greater recognition to theShiite Moslem guerrillas in Iran, the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency reported.   ``By ignoring the rights of Shiites, the Afghan Sunni groups haveharmed the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan,'' Sheikh Asef MohseniQandahari, head of the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, was quotedas saying.   On Thursday, the 46-member Organization of Islamic Conferencevoted to recognize the interim government formed in Pakistan. TheIranian-based factions oppose the interim government, saying they donot have enough representation.</TEXT></DOC>
