To Post Loss For Fiscal First Period </HL><SO> </SO><CO> SRG SRC </CO><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sorg Inc. said it expects to report a loss for its fiscal first quarter, ended Aug. 30, citing slower activity in financial printing since last year's stock market crash.    A year earlier, the company had a loss of $271,000 on $18.5 million in sales. In the fiscal year ended May 31, it had a loss of $4.2 million on sales of $70.8 million.    Gilbert B. Sorg, chairman, chief executive officer and president, said at the annual meeting that he couldn't indicate the size of the loss because of changes in accounting regulations.    Mr. Sorg hopes the financial printing business will pick up after the presidential election. There are &quot;lots of dollars out there,&quot; which &quot;points to continuation of a mergers and acquisitions market,&quot; he said.    Also, the financial printer said it won't cut its work force further. At May 31, 1988, Sorg employed 675 people, down 45 from a year earlier, despite its expansion into a fourth printing plant. &quot;We have done enough in that area,&quot; Mr. Sorg said. Acquisitions are unlikely, Mr. Sorg added.    Despite recent speculation that the company might be taken over, Mr. Sorg said after the meeting that he sees no likelihood of such an effort. He said he has had no contact from Charles P. Young Co. about its 15% stake in Sorg. Young, also a financial printer, is owned by Service Resources Corp., which has indicated it would seek to sell Young. Mr. Sorg said that if the 15% stake were sold as a block on the market, it could depress Sorg's stock price.    Sorg shares closed yesterday at $8, up 25 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Sorg said he sees opportunities for the company to offer printing services that would complement the growing desk-top printing trend. </TEXT></DOC>
