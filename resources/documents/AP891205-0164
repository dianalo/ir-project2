It was unclear how many foreigners were aboard the vehicles.   About 2,000 foreigners were believed trapped in the hotels andapartments in the area, which the rebels seized Saturday on thesecond day of their coup attempt.   But officials said the figure was an estimate and they had nofirm idea how many foreigners were actually there.   Safe passage for the trapped foreigners was delayed Tuesday,although hundreds of others living in the district were able toflee to safer areas amid the most serious coup attempt so faragainst Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986.   Scores of Americans arrived Tuesday at the U.S. Seafront housingcompound, where U.S. Marines were on guard. Others moved to hotelsnear Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 woundedsince rebel soldiers launched the coup attempt Friday.   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated for hoursTuesday with the leader of rebels in Makati. The talks at theIntercontinental Hotel ended at sunset, and Alunan said they wouldcontinue Wednesday. The rebels offered Monday to let the foreignersleave.   Capt. Albert Yen, one of the insurgents, said ``the intention isnot to release Americans.''   ``U.S. meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of ourassault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. ``It is theresponsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationalshostage.''   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalistforces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents fromcontinuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized thebase in the first hours of the coup.   Yen said the rebellion was codenamed ``Seven Days and SevenNights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage operation. Hesaid the takeover of the financial district, which began Saturday,was the second stage.   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for thetrapped Americans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained abouttheir status.   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans foreverything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He wouldnot say what additional military steps the United States might take.   In addition to the 400 Scout Rangers in Makati, a similar numberof mutineers still occupied the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 milessouth of Manila.   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, saidTuesday there would be a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' ifthe government moved against them.   The coast guard arrested five mutineers on a vessel that arrivedTuesday from Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila.   Soldiers established roadblocks north of Manila because ofreports that rebel reinforcements were coming. Maj. Gen. AlfredoLim, the Manila police chief, issued ``shoot to kill'' orders formutineers who tried to enter the city in civilian clothes.   In a statement issued Tuesday in Hong Kong, Vice PresidentSalvador Laurel said the government's resignation would allow for``a new mandate'' and avert civil war. Although Laurel is vicepresident, he broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and has formed anopposition party.   Gov. Roberto Pagdanganan of Bulacan province said Sen. NeptaliGonzalez, chairman of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the DemocraticFilipino Party, suggested in a meeting Monday with the presidentand local officials that she dismiss her Cabinet.   Pagdanganan said most of those present endorsed the proposal,but Mrs. Aquino offered no opinion.   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened publicconfidence.   Banks in Quezon City said withdrawals the last two dayssurpassed the figures for all of November. Jose Concepcion,secretary of Trade and Industry, announced that Mrs. Aquino hadimposed price ceilings on rice, chicken, pork and cooking fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
