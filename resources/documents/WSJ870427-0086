The National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, formed 18 months ago by five major accounting and business groups, is expected to issue its 170-page report today.    The report has already drawn criticism from some who say the recommendations don't go far enough to penalize financial fraud.    James C. Treadway Jr., commission chairman, admitted the panel's recommendations have drawn &quot;static from some parties.&quot; But he said he expects most of the suggestions will be widely accepted in business and accounting circles.    &quot;We may not satisfy all congressional critics of business, but we think that most corporations and major accounting firms will recognize the need for these changes,&quot; added Mr. Treadway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member who has just been named general counsel of PaineWebber Inc., a securities firm.    In one of the most sweeping changes, the panel urges that the SEC be given more power by Congress to impose fines, bring cease and desist proceedings, and bar or suspend violators from serving as corporate officers or directors.    Current securities law allows the SEC to seek only a court injunction to bar corporate officials from repeating an offense.    John C. Burton, dean of Columbia University's graduate school of business and former chief accountant of the SEC, criticized the panel for &quot;not going far enough. The panel should have urged that the SEC should be given the power to bring criminal charges on its own against individuals involved in financial fraud.&quot;    Under current law, the SEC can refer criminal cases to various federal attorneys, and the report suggests only that with SEC assistance, &quot;criminal prosecution for fraudulent financial reporting should be made a higher priority.&quot;    Another controversial panel recommendation calls for streamlining and adding more public members to an auditing standard-setting body. Currently, a 21-member auditing standards board, with two or three members who aren't in public accounting practice, set such rules.    The board is an arm of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the major membership body for CPAs in the U.S. and a sponsor of the fraud panel.    The panel recommends that the auditing standards board be reorganized into an eight to 12-member body with half its members &quot;persons who are knowledgeable about auditing but not engaged in public accounting.&quot;    J. Michael Cook, chairman of the CPA institute, said he had &quot;reservations&quot; about sharply reducing the board's size.    &quot;It will never fly,&quot; said Mr. Cook, who also is chairman of Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells, an accounting firm. &quot;A much smaller board with less public accounting expertise wouldn't have sufficient resources to set proper standards.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Cook said he endorses the rest of the panel's report.    &quot;It puts a broad focus on fraudulent financial reporting by asking for stronger corporate governance and education standards, and stiffer enforcement penalties in business against fraud,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past, too much focus for fraud was placed on the public accounting profession.&quot;    The report also recommends that companies that change auditors or shift accounting principles disclose more about any disagreements with outside auditors. It urges that audit committees of corporate boards be given more clout in accounting, auditing and disclosure areas, and that outside auditors become more involved with quarterly financial statements.    It also recommends that all public accounting firms be peer-reviewed -- a requirement currently being weighed by the SEC. And it urges accountants to upgrade the quality of their reports through required reviews by a second partner, and use of reviews that analyze industry financial ratios to spot business problems.    &quot;Implementing our recommendations would increase the cost of an audit, but it would be well worth it,&quot; said Mr. Treadway.    After a 60-day comment period, the panel's final report will be issued, about Oct. 1.    Besides the CPA institute, the panel's other sponsors are the Americam Accounting Association, the Financial Executives Institute, the Institute of Internal Auditors and the National Association of Accountants. </TEXT></DOC>
