This report coversthe construction of these materials. The latex-modified ID-2 was pavedusing standard paving equipment. Precautions were taken to avoid trackingthe material by the paver and rollers. The cost of latex-modified ID-2is approximately 14% higher than the cost of standard ID-2 used on theproject. The latex-modified bituminous seal coat and surface treatmentwere applied using standard seal coat equipment. No problems were encounteredduring the construction of these SAMIs. The latex-modified seal-coatand surface treatment cost approximately 33% and 20% (respectively) morethan their standard counterparts.</TEXT></DOC>
