In the first referendum of its kind in Sweden, the farmingcommunity of Sjobo rejected a government's request to house andabsorb into the community up to 40 refugees.   Asked on Sunday whether they would accept the refugees, 6,237people voted against no and 3,000 voted in favor _ a margin of 2-1.   The result raised concern that supressed anti-immigrationfeelings would emerge in other parts of the country, known for itsgenerous refugee policy.   Before the referendum it was widely expected the vote would beclose, with a majority voting in favor, reflecting Sweden'sopen-door policies.   ``This is a sad result. Everyone is a loser,'' said MadeleineRamel, head of the social welfare board that would have taken careof the immigrants. ``It is unfortunate for Sjobo.''   The referendum coincided with nationwide parliamentary electionsin which the Social Democrats, who have dominated politics for mostof the past 50 years, retained power.   The result gave the environmental Greens a place in the349-member Riksdag for the first time. It emerged as the secondstrongest Green party in Europe after West Germany.   The Greens appeared to have taken most of their votes from thethree-party non-socialist bloc which registered its lowest resultsince World War II.   The Social Democrats, supported by the Communists, were incontrol with 177 seats. The center-right bloc got 152 and theGreens got 20.   The vote in Sjobo was the first open defiance of Sweden'slongstanding policy to provide a home to refugees and give themlanguage training, job skills, housing, education and otherbenefits.   Last year, 18,000 people sought political asylum in this neutralnation of 8.4 million, the highest rate in Europe, according toofficial figures.   The immigration authorities routinely ask the country's 284local governments to receive refugees in an effort to spreadimmigrants outside the main cities.   Most districts have been positive, but the Sjobo council lastautumn voted 25-24 to put the question to a referendum.   Council Chairman Sven-Olle Olsson, head of the local CenterParty, has been the leader of the fight to keep the immigrants out.   He has been under pressure to drop the referendum but said itwas a matter of ``democracy'' to hold it. Center Party leaders inStockholm have threatened to expel him from the national party.   Until now, Sweden has not witnessed the right-wing backlash tolarge-scale immigration that has appeared in France and neighboringDenmark and Norway.   ``It is scary to see that Sweden's humanistic policy actuallyhas no real support among the people,'' said Signe Jansson, amidwife in Sjobo who voted yes.   But officials cautioned against overestimating the significanceof the vote.   Christina Rogestam, head of immigration, said ``Sweden's refugeepolicy does not stand or fall with Sjobo. We believe that all otherdistricts now will give their support.''   Center Party leader Olof Johansson said ``Sjobo is special. Itis not like all of Sweden, thank God.''   Olsson's campaign against refugees may have spurred a jump inthe popularity of the local Center Party, which took 23 seats in aseparate vote for the 49-member council, eight more than itpreviously held.</TEXT></DOC>
