Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Parliament Fridayof a proposal to move civilians to temporary camps south of Jaffna,``and then clear the north of these scum who call themselvesliberators of the Tamil people.''   The Tamil Tiger rebels have held a 200-man army garrison undersiege in Jaffna since June 11, when they broke a 13-month-oldcease-fire and resumed a seven-year war for Tamil independence.   At least 14,000 people have been killed since the Tamil warbegan, many of them civilians.   Military officials said today that eight Tigers were killed aday earlier in clashes with the army in the eastern and northernregions of this Indian Ocean island. One soldier also died in arebel ambush.   The officials said on condition of anonymity that police raideda rebel hideout in eastern Sri Lanka and seized 17,000 rounds ofammunition, and 200 hand grenades among other weapons.   Wijeratne did not say when the evacuation might begin or howmany people would be moved. Government census figures show 1million Tamils live on the peninsula, but thousands have fledacross the Palk Straits to southern India.   ``The suggestion is before the President. We plan to get allinnocent Tamil civilians out of the Jaffna Peninsula and then throwthe Tamil terrorists into the salty waters of the Palk Straits,''Wijeratne said.   Government and military officials said privately it may takesome time for Premadasa to decide on the plan. ``This is no easytask,'' said one senior military officer.   The army has been poised to move into the peninsula since latelast month when it recaptured strategic villages around ElephantPass, which controls the only road across the narrow land linkbetween Jaffna and mainland Sri Lanka.   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the population, startedfighting in 1983 for a homeland in the northern and easternprovinces, where they are a majority.   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the majoritySinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and control thegovernment and army. The remaining 7 percent are Moslems.</TEXT></DOC>
