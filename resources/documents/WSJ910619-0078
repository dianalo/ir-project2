Reginald Bartholomew, undersecretary of state forinternational security affairs, said that in two days oftalks with Chinese officials he was able only to obtainassurances that China would &quot;consider&quot; adhering tointernational pacts that limit sales of nuclear technologyand sophisticated missiles. Mr. Bartholomew also indicatedthat Chinese officials didn't respond to American requeststhat China cancel planned sales of medium-range missiles toSyria and Pakistan.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Let me simply say that there was some movement, but a lotof work remains,&quot; said Mr. Bartholomew, who returns toWashington today. With President Bush locked in a battle withCongress over granting most-favored-nation trading status toChina, administration officials were hoping that Mr.Bartholomew could return to Washington with something to helpappease the lawmakers.   On May 27, President Bush said he would renew China'smost-favored-nation trade status, which lowers the tariffs onChinese imports into the U.S. Many in Congress want torestrict the trade status to punish Beijing for what they seeas irresponsible weapons-export policies, human rights abusesand trade policies that have widened the U.S. trade deficitwith China.   Mr. Bartholomew said the most encouraging sign during hisvisit was China's pledge to &quot;take a serious look at&quot; signingthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France recently said itwould sign the treaty, leaving China as the onlynon-signatory among the five countries with fully developednuclear weapons programs.   Chinese officials also told Mr. Bartholomew that China wasstudying whether to observe limits spelled out in the MissileTechnology Control Regime. The regime involves 15 countriesin working together to control the transfer of technologythat could help countries establish programs to buildmissiles that could deliver nuclear and chemical warheads.   U.S. officials say China has plans to sell newly developedM-9 and M-11 tactical ballistic missiles to Pakistan andSyria. Published reports say the missiles could have a rangeof up to 540 miles, while others say it is only between 180and 360 miles.   With Pakistan, the concern is that its planned purchase ofM-11 missiles would give it the potential to hit India with anuclear warhead. Selling the longer-range M-9 missile toSyria would give it the ability to hit targets throughoutIsrael.   Congress last fall attached an amendment to the DefenseAuthorization Act requiring the U.S. to penalize countriesthat violate the missile-control regime. The regime restrictsthe transfer of missiles capable of delivering a minimum800-pound payload a distance of 180 miles. U.S. experts sayChinese weapons dealers bill the M-11 missile as capable ofdelivering a 1,280-pound warhead.</TEXT></DOC>
