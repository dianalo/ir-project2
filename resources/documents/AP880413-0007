Army officials who reported the figure on Tuesday said itrepresents only ``a small percentage'' of the American arsenal, butSen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, was still worried.   ``That's frightening: 1,000 leakers,'' he said. ``That's aserious problem.''   Army officials agreed with Glenn when he said ``the problem isnot going to get less'' as the stockpile, already averaging 25years old, continues to age.   Acting on congressional orders, the Army has come up with a planto destroy the chemical weapons at the eight U.S. sites where theyare stored, but plans for local burning in closed incinerators facesome opposition, Army officials said.   The leaking weapons are quickly enclosed in newer, safercontainers, Brig. Gen. David Nydam told the Senate Armed Servicessubcommittee on strategic weapons.   Nydam said the number of leaking weapons is only ``a smallpercentage'' of the total U.S. stockpile, but he declined topublicize the size of the stockpile, telling the subcommittee thefigure is classified. Published reports have estimated thestockpile, by weight, at between 25,000 and 40,000 tons.   The current U.S. stockpile, which was built before 1969,consists of unitary weapons, which include artillery shells andbombs filled with a variety of chemicals and nerve gases.   The Army is now starting to manufacture newer chemical weapons,known as binary weapons because they are composed of two chemicalskept separate until the shell is fired or bomb is dropped.   As part of the compromise that ended a long fight with Congressover whether to build new chemical weapons, the Army agreed to comeup with a plan to destroy the old stockpile. The incineration planwill cost $2.7 billion and take until 1997, service officials said.   Army officials say almost all the current stockpile is so oldthat the weapons are militarily useless.   The weapons are stored at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.;Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.;Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.;Pueblo Army Depot, Colo.; Tooele Army Depot, Utah; and UmatillaArmy Depot, Ore.   U.S. chemical weapons are also based in West Germany and storedon Johnston Atoll, a deserted island about 400 miles south ofHawaii.   The Army says the safest method of destruction is incinerationin closed containers at the eight sites, a plan opposed bycommunities in some of the areas.   John Shannon, assistant secretary of the Army, said residents ofthe areas around the Aberdeen, Newport and Lexington storage siteshave objected to the incineration plans. At the other five sites,he said, residents ``have expressed the desire that we get on withit.''   Shannon was told by Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., that the Armyshould do a better job of selling its plan to the public.   ``There's been some progress (in swaying public opinion), butwe've got a long way to go,'' Quayle said. ``We in the Senatebecome involved when our constituency feels it is shortchanged.''   Shannon admitted mistakes were made at the site in Quayle'sstate. ``We did not do a good job in Newport in the beginning,'' hesaid. ``We'll have to do better.''   Other destruction options considered by the Army includedtransportation of all the weapons by rail to Tooele, where theywould be burned; or transportation of some to Tooele and others toAnniston. But both those plans involve movement of the weaponsthrough at least 16 other states and opposition would likelysurface in some of those states, Shannon said.</TEXT></DOC>
