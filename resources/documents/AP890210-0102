U.S. delegate William H. Marsh told the United Nations HumanRights Commission that American laws ``imposed some of the world'smost severe restrictions on trade with South Africa,'' but withoutsignificant results.   ``Because of our experience, the United States believes the ideaof comprehensive and mandatory sanctions can contribute very littletoward achieving the abolition of apartheid, the fundamental goal weall share,'' he said.   Marsh spoke as the 40-nation commission discussed a U.N. reportthat says South Africa's black majority overwhelmingly favorssweeping economic, diplomatic and other sanctions as the mosteffective way to pressure the white government to end racialdiscrimination.   Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department said in its annualreport on human rights worldwide that conditions in South Africacontinued to deteriorate last year because of greater governmentrepression of opponents of apartheid.</TEXT></DOC>
