Thespecies has been reported from Onion Creek, Travis County, and Salado Creek,Bell County, Texas; from the Arkansas River drainage, and from Archey Forkof the Little Red River, Van Buren County, Arkansas (Clarke 1987). Thespeckled pocketbook was collected from the South Fork of the Little RedRiver near Clinton, Arkansas in 1984 and 1985 (John Harris, personal communication).Dr. Arthur Clarke collected the speckled pocketbook from the Middle Forkof the Little Red River in 1986.The record of <T3>L. streckeri </T3>from the Arkansas River drainage reported as <T3>Actinonaias streckeri, </T3>was determined by Johnson (1980) to bethe result of misidentification with the specimens actually being <T3>A. rafinesqueana. </T3>The Texas records of <T3>L. streckeri </T3>either cannot be confirmed or are misidentificationsof <T3>L. bracteata </T3>(Clarke 1987). The Texas streams are low-gradientand do not provide the required habitat. Numerous recent collections inthese streams have contained <T3>L. bracteata </T3>but not <T3>L. streckeri. </T3>The only confirmed sites are in the watershed ofthe Little Red River.The speckled pocketbook is a thin mussel about 80 mm long. The shells areellipitical, dark yellow or brown with chevron-like spots, and rays thatare chain-like (Frierson 1927). The shells exhibit sexual dimorphism withthe females becoming broader and more evenly rounded posteriorly. It canbe confused with species of similar shell morphology unless an individualis knowledgeable of mussels and is very observant.<T3>Villosa vibex </T3>occurs in streams to the south and east of the Stateof Arkansas, and is very similar to <T3>L. streckeri </T3>based upon only shell morphology. However, charactersof the mantle flap differ. Members of the genus <T3>Lampsilis </T3>have a very distinctive mantle flap in the soft parts.In <T3>Lampsilis streckeri, </T3>the mantle flap resembles a small minnowwith a small pigment spot and about 5 triangular processes providing aflaring appearance. This unique mantle is apparently used to entice fishclose enough for the mussel's larval or glochidia to attach.Other similar species are <T3>L. reeveiana, L. radiata siliquoidea, </T3>and <T3>L. bracteata. </T3>In all three of these similar species, the shelllacks the chevron-like spots and the rays are continuous rather than ribbon-like.<T3>Lampsilis bracteata </T3>is only reported from Texas. In <T3>L. r. siliquoidea, </T3>the rays are limited to the posterior slopeof the shell or become faded before reaching the ventral margin (Burch1975). <T3>Lampsilis reeveiana </T3>further differs by having a large pigmentspot and up to twice the triangular processes on the mantle flap (Clarke1987).The current known range of <T3>L. streckeri </T3>is limited to about 6 miles of the Middle Fork ofthe Little Red River in Stone and Van Buren Counties, Arkansas. Adjacentland in this area is privately owned. The species is found in coarse tomuddy sand in depths up to 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) with a constant flow ofwater. This constant flow of water suggests a requirement for well oxygenatedconditions and supports Clarke's (1987) conclusion that it cannot survivein pool conditions. Within the Middle Fork, the known range is betweenthe confluences of Meadow Creek upstream and Tick Creek downstream. AboveMeadow Creek, the Middle Fork is reduced to intermittent flows during dryperiods. From the confluence of Tick Creek downstream to the influenceof Greers Ferry Reservoir, the habitat appears suitable for <T3>L. streckeri </T3>but is devoid of live mussels. The species has apparentlybeen extirpated from the remainder of the Little Red River system. Theimpoundment of Greers Ferry Reservoir and the resulting cold (hypolimnetic)discharges altered virtually all of the mainstem. Channel modificationsin Archey and South Forks have modified much of the habitat and likelycaused increased water velocities that altered the remaining habitat inthese streams.The species was listed as a candidate (category 2) in the notice of reviewpublished on May 22, 1984, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 21664). Category 2 species are those taxafor which the Service needs additional information before proposing tolist the species. The proposed rule to classify <T3>L. streckeri</T3> as endangered was published on July 25, 1988, inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27884).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested partieswere requested to submit factual reports or information that might contributeto the development of a final rule. Appropriate State agencies, countygovernments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interestedparties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice invitinggeneral public comment was published in the ``Arkansas Democrat,'' LittleRock, Arkansas, on August 7; in the ``Arkansas Sun,'' Heber Springs, Arkansas,and in the ``Cliburne County Times,'' Heber Springs, Arkansas, on August10; and in the ``Arkansas Gazette,'' Little Rock, Arkansas, on August 14,1988. Four comments were received. Two State agencies commented in supportof the proposed rule. One private individual simply requested more information.A county agency did not oppose the listing, but requested the Service toconduct a thorough study of this species to ensure that it is endangeredbefore placing this species on the list. The survey conducted by Clarkewas funded by the service to answer the questions presented by this response,and in the view of the Service, the study provides all the data necessaryfor this determination. Other surveys were also reviewed in making thisdetermination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the speckled pocketbook <T3>(Lampsilis streckeri)</T3> should be classified as an endangered species.Procedures found at Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the speckledpocketbook <T3>(Lampsilis streckeri)</T3> are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The speckled pocketbook once occurred inthe Little Red River and three tributaries, Archey, South and Middle Forks.The scarcity of collecting records prevents the delineation of the historicrange within this system. From what we know of the mussel's preferred habitatand of the Little Red River, the speckled pocketbook very likely occurredin the stretch of river now impounded by Greers Ferry Reservoir, and inthe downstream area now altered by the reservoir's cold (hypolimnetic)discharges. The lentic conditions imposed by the reservoir and the hypolimneticdischarges undoubtedly eliminated any speckled pocketbook population inthis stretch of river. Archey and South Forks have been modified for floodcontrol. The modification of these channels are the likely cause of thespecies' apparent disappearance from these tributaries. The small populationof speckled pocketbooks in the South Fork, below the confluence with ArcheyFork, apparently have been extirpated by floods scouring the mussel's habitat(Clarke 1987). This scouring likely results from increased water velocitydue to channel modification upstream. The only remaining population ofthe speckled pocketbook is in the Middle Fork Little Red River, Van Burenand Stone Counties, Arkansas (Clarke 1987). Threats to the Middle Forkpopulation appear to be some unidentified and intermittent water pollutionfrom the vicinity of Tick Creek's confluence. The presence of mussel shellsin the Middle Fork downstream of Tick Creek and the lack of live musselsof any species indicates a pollution event that eliminated all mussel faunain this stretch. This river reach down to the influence of Greers FerryReservoir still provides suitable habitat for the speckled pocketbook,and the species could probably be reestablished if high water quality ismaintained.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes.</T3> The only known population is restricted to a short reachof one river and consists of only a few hundred individuals (Clarke 1987).Any collection of live individuals from this area would further reducea population that is already limited and possibly declining. This specieshas not been known to have been subjected to any previous commercial purpose.C. <T3>Disease and predation.</T3> Disease is not an apparent threat. Thepreferred habitat is in shallow water and this makes the species more vulnerableto predation by raccoons and muskrats.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> The speciesis not protected by any existing Federal or State regulation. Arkansasrequires a scientific collecting permit for anyone to collect any speciesof mollusc. This permit requirement is very difficult to enforce and generallyreceives a low priority from law enforcement personnel.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The fish host for the juvenile stage of the speckled pocketbook is unknown;therefore, impacts on this aspect of the mussel's life cycle cannot beevaluated. The Middle Fork population range is limited upstream by lawor non-existent water flows during the dry months of the year. Much ofArchey and South Forks have intermittent water flows during dry seasons,which may be partially due to flood control work discussed under FactorA. The population is so limited that isolated gene pools that are vulnerableto loss of genetic variability are a distinct possibility. This musseldepends upon water currents to transport gametes from one individual toanother. The reduced density of the population decreases the likelihoodof successful reproduction.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the speckled pocketbook as endanged. Endangeredstatus is determined because of the very limited range in one stream, smallpopulation size and vulnerability to a single event. Threatened statusis not appropriate because the species is restricted to a short stretchof a single river. Critical habitat is not determined for this speciesfor reasons given in the next section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat as the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time owing to lack of benefitfrom such designation. No additional benefits would accrue from a criticalhabitat designation that do not already accrue from the listing. Preciselocality data are available to appropriate agencies through the Serviceoffice described in the ADDRESSES section. All involved parties and landowners will be notified of the location and importance of protecting thisspecies' habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires the recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal involvement is expected to include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineerschannel maintenance activities and Environmental Protection Agency pollutioncontrol and pesticide use programs. The Corps of Engineers conducts channelmaintenance for flood control on Archey and South Forks, both of whichcould be important to the survival and recovery of this species. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency would be involved with efforts to prevent water qualitydegradation and to approve the use of pesticides within the known rangeof this species. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sellor offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species.It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or shipany such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions wouldapply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. Insome instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of timeto relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such reliefwere not available. Since this mussel is not known to be involved in anycommercial activity, no request for relief under such a permit are expected.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environnmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Burch, J.B. 1975.
