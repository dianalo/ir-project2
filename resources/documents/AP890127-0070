OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Balmy temperatures and a lack of snow in such typically snowboundsections as Wisconsin and New England have made this a winter ofdiscontent for devotees of pastimes like snow sculpting andsnowmobiling.   In Milwaukee, the popular U.S. International Snow SculpturingCompetition would have been snowless had organizers not saved 10-tonblocks of snow from a storm last month. Ice sculptors were forcedinside Thursday by temperatures in the upper 30s.   ``Now that's not Wisconsin in the winter,'' said Wendell Howardof Waukesha, who was visiting the Icebreaker Winter Funfest there.``We like something around more around zero or 20 below, at leastfor a couple of weeks in January.''   In snow-starved Boston, traditional winter white has beenreplaced by dreary browns and grays. About an inch of snow fellThursday, but was quickly melted by a drizzle.   ``You take what you can get,'' said National Weather Servicemeteorologist Bernie Schor.   Boston gets 12.5 inches of snow during a normal January and hastemperatures in the 30s. This year, the weather has been dry andwarm, with temperatures above 50 degrees some days.   ``This is not a record year, but it's down with a handful of lowyears,'' Schor said.   Milwaukee has had 12.5 inches of snow so far this winter, onlyabout a fourth of the normal seasonal total. Temperatures this monthhave averaged more than 28 degrees, about 10 degrees above normal.   The weather posed a major problem for the winter festival and itssnow sculpting contest, which draws thousands of spectators andfeatures highly detailed creations more than 8 feet tall crafted byteams from 10 nations.   Organizers recommended that sculptors work at night whentemperatures are lower, ordered wood chips to cover muddied groundsand moved ice-sculpting events to an ice house.   Snow sculptors ``looked really dejected, really disappointed''because they had to be indoors, Karin Bach of the Canadian women'steam, said Thursday. ``But we're all back today and we'll still havesome excellent works no matter what the weather,'' she said.   Gene Kempfer, director of the snow sculpting competition, saidthe forecast for spring-like temperatures this weekend forced him tomove up the time of the judging Saturday so judges could see thefinished products before the sun began melting them.   The weather has also been bad news for snowmobilers in southernWisconsin.   ``We're wiped out this year as far snow goes,'' said DickKillian, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Snowmobiles Club.   In upstate Wisconsin, snow has been plentiful for skiers, but icefishermen have been advised to use caution because frozen lakes arenot as solid as they should be.   In Boston, the mild weather has lowered heating and municipalcosts. The city has spent about $700,000 on winter-related jobs likesnow removal, compared to the $2 million spent by this time lastyear, said city Public Works Commissioner Joe Casazza.   The dearth of moisture has prompted concern about water supplies.   ``Our Quabbin Reservoir, which is the largest reservoir in theNortheast, is down to 68 percent full and normally it is at about 81or 82 percent of capacity so that's a significant shortfall,'' saidIlyas Bhatti, director of Metropolitan Watershed Management Division.   ``We are definitely concerned about it. I think if we don't getenough precipitation this winter, we're probably going to be facingsevere water supply problems this summer,'' he said.   Skiers in New England have had to ski on machine-made snow untilthe past couple weeks.   Some places have gotten snow. On Thursday, a driving snowstormdumped up to 6 inches of snow on much of Maine, delaying flights,closing schools and causing numerous traffic accidents.   But merchants had little hope the storm would salvage poor salesof such winter gear as shovels and snow tires.   ``For us, it's (too) far into winter for it to do any good,''said Robert Jackman, sales manager of Wescott andamp; Sons in Standish.``You need a couple good storms a few times a week ... then peoplewill get back into winter products.''</TEXT></DOC>
