Patrick Swindall's latest radio commercial is &quot;Exonerated.&quot; In it he makes an odd campaign pledge: to win acquittal of federal perjury charges before Election Day.    This is the year's strangest re-election campaign. It features an ardently moralistic Republican congressman who walked into a federal drug-money sting operation while trying to finance a $1.2 million house, and a recovered-alcoholic challenger once charged with battery by one of his three ex-wives.    &quot;It's almost like a miniseries,&quot; says Democratic candidate Ben Jones. Indeed, Mr. Jones himself is a television actor, best known nationally for his portrayal of a hot-rod mechanic named &quot;Cooter&quot; on the TV series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard.&quot;    Rep. Swindall is campaigning from a federal courtroom, acting as his own defense counsel while radiating an unwavering confidence. &quot;I clearly think I can win,&quot; he says. But yesterday, his fortunes sunk to a new low as federal Judge Robert Vining dismissed the jury on grounds that the congressman sent campaign mailings about the case despite rules restricting comments outside the courtroom.    The judge said he might grant Rep. Swindall's request for a non-jury trial, but added that he probably wouldn't. That would leave the indictment hanging on through Election Day.    The bizarre chain of events that caused the incumbent to become an underdog began unfolding during the 1986 campaign. Mr. Swindall, elected in 1984 running as a fundamentalist Christian, began facing questions about a big house he was building on 13 tree-shaded acres near Stone Mountain State Park. The three-story mansion, with seven bedrooms, 7 1/2 bathrooms, swimming pool, tennis court and three-car garage, overlooks a small lake. Television stations dispatched helicopters to get aerial pictures of the immense home.    Mr. Jones, who was running that year as well, discovered the home was being built by a local official in television evangelist Pat Robertson's Freedom Council. The builder, John Sauers, sent Mr. Jones a questionnaire asking things like &quot;Is Jesus Lord of your life?&quot; and &quot;Do you believe the Bible is the infallible word of God?&quot; Answers were to be circulated to local churches, which presumably would have aided Rep. Swindall. Mr. Jones countered by suggesting that Mr. Sauers was giving the congressman a sweet deal on construction costs.    But the builder's bills mounted after the election to $1.2 million, hundreds of thousands more than Rep. Swindall had said during the campaign. Mr. Sauers is still trying to collect, and numerous subcontractors have filed liens.    Meanwhile, to retire the construction loan, the congressman began negotiations last year for a mortgage from a flamboyant local businessman, Charles LeChasney, who spoke with a foreign accent, drove a Rolls Royce, owned a landmark Atlanta mansion and had donated $500 to the Swindall campaign in 1985. But Mr. LeChasney was ensnared in a government sting operation. He was in financial trouble himself and had turned to laundering drug money to raise cash quickly. Or so he thought. Actually, he was dealing with an undercover agent for the Internal Revenue Service, Mike Mullaney. That led to federal charges to which Mr. LeChasney pleaded guilty Friday.    In June the Atlanta Constitution published extensive excerpts of tape recordings from the investigation, showing that Rep. Swindall received numerous warnings that the $850,000 he sought to borrow might be the fruit of drug deals. &quot;My gut feeling is there has to be narcotics dollars in there,&quot; the IRS undercover agent told him at one point. Nevertheless, Rep. Swindall accepted one $150,000 check from a LeChasney company and endorsed it over to his builder, but then retrieved it uncashed and backed out of the deal when the IRS man, posing as &quot;Mike Martinez,&quot; insisted on getting a receipt.    U.S. Attorney Robert Barr, a Republican appointee, obtained a 10-count indictment Oct. 17 accusing Rep. Swindall of lying to a federal grand jury to cover up his involvement with the alleged money-laundering scheme. Mr. Swindall chalks it up to faulty recollection; &quot;If this was a memory test, I failed,&quot; he says.    Whatever happens in the courtroom, it could already be too late to turn the election around. Mr. Jones doesn't seem to have been hurt by confessions that he had several arrests in his younger, heavy-drinking days, including the battery charge, later dropped, by an ex-wife whom he shoved in a bar. Mr. Jones says he hasn't had a drink since 1977. He wed his current wife, Vivian, in 1979. They have a four-year-old son.    In 1986 Mr. Jones got 47% of the vote despite spending only $118,000. This time he'll spend $450,000, and a local TV station's poll the other night had him leading the indicted congressman 54% to 25%.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 28, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
