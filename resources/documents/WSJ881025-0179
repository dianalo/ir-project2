The package, which includes debt buy-outs, debt-for-equity swaps, and divestitures, will lower the huge conglomerate's debt to about $400 million from $1.7 billion. The move puts another dent in Mexico's declining private-sector debt, which will now fall to around $10 billion from its peak of about $22.5 billion in 1983. Mexico's embattled president-elect Carlos Salina de Gortari is counting on companies, such as Visa, to spearhead the country's return to economic growth when he takes office on Dec. 1.    &quot;The Visas of Mexico will be the building blocks for the new administration,&quot; said one government economic planner.    Mexico's total foreign debt stands at about $104 billion, with the government debt totaling about $90 billion. The U.S. government last week authorized as much as $3.5 billion in new loans to Mexico to help Mr. Salinas sustain the country's economic reforms and shore up his shaky political standing.    Visa, a beer, soft drink and packaging group, grew quickly during Mexico's oil boom, but its crash in 1982 was symptomatic of the near collapse of major industry in Mexico after oil prices declined.    Under the restructuring, Visa's creditors and new investors will own about a 40% stake in the company. The cash buy-out portion of the plan will be financed with $170 million in new, long-term debt, $230 million from divestitures and operations, and $60 million in new equity subscriptions. The remainder of the company's debt will be exchanged for about $230 million in various, restructured notes and $100 million in common shares.    &quot;The new financial structure will allow us to expand into new markets in Mexico and abroad,&quot; said Ricardo Guajardo, director general of Visa. The company said it would place special emphasis on the export market, which since 1982 has grown at a compound annual rate of 20%.    Bank of America is chairman of the steering committee for the more than 60 banks participating in the restructuring along with Mexico's development bank.    The harmonious atmosphere at the signing was a marked contrast to the rocky early relations between banks and companies in this industrial center. But the growth of the secondary market for debt and the other debt-reduction innovations helped to overcome the impasse.    Acting as broker in the deal was the International Finance Corp., a World Bank affiliate that recently initiated a program to promote private-sector debt restructurings. In June, Grupo Apasco S.A., a big cement maker, used the program to reduce its debt to $70 million from $200 million. Shortly before that Salumi S.A., a processed meat producer, cut its debt to $20 million from $69 million. </TEXT></DOC>
