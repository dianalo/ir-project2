SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Managers of a key Star Wars experiment whoclaim major progress with a potential anti-missile weapon sayCongress' budget cuts leave the futuristic space defense program``up in the air.''   ``The real issue is, what is the funding for SDI?'' said AirForce Col. Thomas Meyer, the head of the Strategic DefenseInitiative Organization's office of directed energy.   ``It's difficult for me to tell you when we'll have a weapon inspace without a clear definition of what our future funding is. Andit's continuing to be up in the air,'' Meyer told reporters.   He spoke at a Pentagon news conference Monday on the results ofSDI's latest experiment, which for the first time shot a beam ofatomic particles into the heavens.   The BEAR _ or Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ was considered aprimary step in the Pentagon's reseach into the lasers, beamaccelerators and other futuristic weapons to shoot down nuclearmissiles.   Meyer said elements of the experiment have produced``on-the-shelf hardware,'' but that some engineering problems stillneed to be worked out.   ``It only takes the money to put it together ... and that's whenwe'll get the weapon,'' he said.   The $60 million experiment, launched over White Sands MissileRange in New Mexico last Thursday, was conducted to test how aneutral particle beam accelerator would work in space.   The SDI system would make use of particle beams as a potentialanti-missile weapon. A beam would be shot across space to determinewhether an object fired into the sky is a decoy or an enemy warhead.Also, the beam could be used to disable such a missile.   Last week's experiment involved lifting into space _ just for afew minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Airesrocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator wasturned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how theparticle beams moved.   Meyer and his aides declared the test a success, displaying afuzzy black and white video tape of the bright, pulsing beam as itemerged from the rocket.   Meyer said the experiment showed that the complex equipmentneeded to produce the beam could be made compactly, survive beingshot into space, and function well.   ``We took a laboratory experiment and showed .. it can beoperated autonomously in space. It is a major achievement, both intechnology and engineering,'' Meyer said.   Overall, Meyer said, the experiment clearly ``demonstrates thepromise (of SDI) that we have talked about all along.''   The director said the program's designers and scientists alsowanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affectedthe beam.   The test came as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has beenfending off budget cuts directed at the billion-dollar program byCapitol Hill.   Last month, the House Armed Services Committee voted to slash$1.1 billion from Cheney's budget for the anti-missile program. Byvoice vote, the committee approved a $3.5 billion budget for SDI,considerably less than the $4.6 billion President Bush proposed forthe program.   On Friday, the Senate Armed Services Committee reduced theadministration's request to $4.5 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
