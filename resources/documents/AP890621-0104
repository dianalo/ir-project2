Botha came in 1984.   Forty members of the opposition Labor Party signed a motion inthe House of Commons urging Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher not tosee de Klerk, who is expected to become South Africa's president inSeptember.   They described the visit as ``unwelcome, untimely and damaging tothe prospects of dismantling apartheid in South Africa andestablishing peace in southern Africa.''   De Klerk became head of the National Party in February, shortlyafter Botha suffered a stroke.   Botha, the head of government since 1978, has indicated he willstep down as president after parliamentary elections in September.The National Party, which is virtually certain to win the polls,designated de Klerk as Botha's successor.   De Klerk said at Heathrow Airport he looked forward to meetingMrs. Thatcher, the West's most outspoken opponent of imposing toughsanctions on South Africa.   This year, after visiting two of South Africa's neighboring blackstates, Zimbabwe and Malawi, Mrs. Thatcher pledged to increasecontact with South African leaders. She said that is the best way ofpressing for an end to apartheid and the release of black leaderNelson Mandela.   Asked if he thought Mrs. Thatcher could help end South Africa'sisolation, de Klerk said, ``I don't want to comment on her specificrole.''   ``She has always taken a principled stand from her viewpoint andwe don't want to misuse her in any sense of the word whatsoever,''de Klerk added.   ``Basically, the state of relations between Britain and SouthAfrica has always been good and we hope that it will remain so _ andobviously we hope that it will improve.''   De Klerk also will go to West Germany, Italy, Portugal andSwitzerland.   He will meet West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn onThursday and then return to London for talks with Mrs. Thatcher onFriday.   De Klerk is the highest-ranking South African official to visitBritain since Botha came five years ago. During that visit, Bothadeclared that ``apartheid is dead.''   He returned home to install a new constitution that ensuredcontinued rule by the white minority.   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 millionwhites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schoolsand health services.</TEXT></DOC>
