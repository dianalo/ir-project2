Smith said yesterday.    U.S. trade officials had charged earlier this week that the Japanese government wasn't enforcing the agreement, which is supposed to provide for improved U.S. access to the Japanese market and prevent &quot;dumping,&quot; or the sale of computer chips for less than a fair market price, in third countries. The Japanese government has said the U.S. charges are vague. Japanese chip companies, meanwhile, have said they are following the rules set by their government.    U.S. trade officials, ending a week of high-level negotiations in Japan, didn't report any progress in the semiconductor talks or in a wide range of other issues, including gaining foreign participation in the Kansai International Airport construction project and the sale of more supercomputers to government bodies in Japan. U.S. officials said they are optimistic that progress on all the issues can be made.    &quot;Results have been mixed,&quot; said Bruce Smart, undersecretary of commerce. The $6.6 billion airport is the world's most expensive. The U.S. wants foreign companies involved in the lucrative earth-moving and construction portions of the project.    &quot;Though the jury is still out, I believe the Kanasai situation has improved,&quot; Mr. Smart said, because a few small contracts have been awarded to American companies.    He also said, however, that the Japanese government was unresponsive to U.S. concerns about supercomputer sales. &quot;There was no discernible common ground,&quot; added Mr. Smith, the deputy trade representative. U.S. trade negotiators told the Japanese government they suspected it was assisting the Japanese supercomputer industry in its efforts to grow strong enough to take on the U.S. companies, a U.S. trade official said privately.    Japanese officials said the talks concerned U.S. industry's lack of marketing in Japan.    However, Mr. Smart did say that the talks to improve the access of U.S. mobile telephones were &quot;useful and informative.&quot;    He said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has &quot;been unwilling or unable -- I cannot tell which -- to fully implement Japan's side&quot; of the semiconductor agreement.    He and Mr. Smith refused to say what steps the U.S. might take against Japan. A trade official said privately that one clear option is reinstating the unfair trade practice suit against Japan, which would give the president broad powers to retaliate. </TEXT></DOC>
