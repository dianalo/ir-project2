Some of the major conclusions of the three-man emergencyboard named by President Bush are likely to be received morekindly by railroads than by their unions, though the findingsstopped short of all the industry has been seeking. Thepanel's report was issued yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Under the Railway Labor Act, the unions can strike therailroads or the roads can unilaterally enact their ownoffers at midnight Feb. 14, if the two sides don't negotiatean agreement by then. The National Mediation Board said itwill schedule a resumption of the negotiations soon.   But if the U.S. remains at war with Iraq in mid-February,it's unclear whether the unions would feel bold enough towalk, threatening to disrupt railroads' support for the wareffort. The war &quot;influences our decision to try to settlethis issue as quickly as possible,&quot; said Richard Kilroy,president of the Transportation Communications Union.   And Congress, which has typically stopped railroad strikesafter no more than a few days by enacting recommendations ofemergency boards into law, would probably be even more eagerto do so this time, if a Persian Gulf war persists.   The emergency board's report covered an unusually broadrange of bargaining issues. The conclusions mostly took amiddle track, recommending wage increases short of thosesought by unions, which opposed railroad efforts to freeze orcut wages; switching of some of the health-cost burden toworkers; and reducing of much, though far from all, of thework restrictions that rail management dislikes.   The recommendations &quot;go too far on wages and not nearlyfar enough on work rule relief,&quot; said Charles Hopkins, therailroads' chief labor negotiator. But railroad officialsacknowledged privately that the report made substantialstrides toward achieving some work-rules rollbacks they havesought for years.   For instance, the board recommended that the mileage thattrain crews must travel for a day's pay be boosted to 130miles by 1995 from the current 108 miles. It was increasedfrom 100 miles in 1985, and railroads have proposed raisingthe mileage limit to 160 miles.   One rail-labor official said after an early reading of thereport, &quot;I don't see anything that would make us happy.&quot; Mr.Kilroy said rail unions didn't get &quot;by a long shot what wehave patiently waited for.&quot;   But he said that for the railway clerks the TCUrepresents, the recommendations, with some modification,would create &quot;a solid base for a negotiated settlement, ifthe rail carriers pull back from their position on no wageincreases and sweeping rule concessions.&quot;   The board recommended a series of lump-sum wage paymentsand wage increases of 3% to 4% through Jan. 1, 1995, andcost-of-living increases every six months after that. But italso proposed that up to half of the lump-sum payments from1992 to 1995 and half of later cost-of-living payments beavailable to cover up to 25% of increases in health-insurancecosts.   The panel rejected the railroads' proposals for wage cutsif crew sizes aren't cut, and for national negotiation of thecrew size issue. The board agreed with the UnitedTransportation Union's contention that this issue should stayat the local level. But it recommended that if localagreements aren't reached by Oct. 31 of this year, eitherparty be able to ask for binding arbitration, to be concludedby the end of 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
