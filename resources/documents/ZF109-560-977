 SAA's relational database family includes DB2 andSQL/DS for the System/370, OS/400 Database Manager for the AS/400 and OS/2Extended Edition (OS/2EE) Database Manager for PCs.andP;  IBM's goal isdistributed collection of interconnected databases.andM;As this SAA strategy evolves, software suppliers and user organizations,including IBM, are building products and systems on the three platforms, withthe assurance that the common set of architectural features will expand intoa consistent level of data access and management support.andM;Structured Query Language (SQL), the SAA database access language, is a keycomponent of relational technology.andP;  It can be used as a query language or beembedded in programs written in Cobol, Fortran, C and PL/1.andP;  It also supportsdata management and data administration functions.andM;Today, much of the activity revolves around DB2 on System/370 mainframes andthe OS/2EE DAtabase Manager.andP;  Three vendors who have committed to the SAAdata management strategy are Sterling Software Inc., Canoga Park, Calif.,andO;Integral Systems, Inc., Walnut Creek, Calif., and Tesseract Corp., SanFrancisco.andM;Sterling Software is a long-time developer for IBM platforms.andP;  Its Answerseries of fourth-generation tools lets users query mainframe databases fromIBM and other vendors.andP;  Sterling's Micro Answer support extracting data frommainframe databases and downloading that data into PC-DOS products.andM;Scheduled for delivery by year-end, Presentation Answer, an SAA- compliantproduct, will support cooperative processing applications using the OS/2EEDatabase Manager and Presentation Manager.andM;Sterling committed to SAA over two years ago, noted Fred Braddock, vicepresident of Randamp;D.andP;  &quot;We got in very early, and the ground rules changedseveral times.andP;  This caused us to change directions, which was frustrating.andO;But that's one of the penalties of being a pioneer.&quot;andM;Braddock notes that SAA is evolving, but the early components have settleddown.andP;  For example, SQL is almost stable.andP;  The Common User Access (CUA) isless stable, with changes caused by shifts in hardware platforms.andM;However, Braddock believes the current set of functions are correct andnecessary.andM;Communications is another issue.andP;  Although Braddock acknowledged that theCPI-C (Common Programming Interface, Communications) has a fairlywell-defined set of protocols, he said that it is evolving with the&quot;uncomfortable feeling that we haven't done the right thing yet,&quot; especiallyin the area of distributing data.andM;&quot;There isn't a welath of experience or expertise there to know whethereverything is connected right and working efficiently.andP;  There's not even awealth of agreement on what distributed means, much less on how to do it,&quot;Braddock said.andM;Presentation answer will access data stored anywhere on a mainframe, downloadit to the PC and store it in the OS/2EE Database Manager as rows and tables.andO;Then any product that can access the Database Manager can work with thatdata.andM;Sterling is writing interim Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) toexpedite the communications links for Presentation Answer.andP;  One interfaceworks between the application and CPI-C to pass SQL statements between theOS/2 and mainframe modules of Presentation Answer.andM;The first stage will take SQL and interpret it as required to access themainframe data.andP;  Because the API uses SQL, any application that talks to SQLcan talk to Presentation Answer.andP;  Thus, the second stage will be able to goto the mainframe or to the local database manager.andP;  &quot;We will have the effectof joining both mainframe and local data,&quot; Braddock said.andM;According to Braddock, Sterling is architecting the additions so that as IBMcomponents become available, they replace Sterling's.andP;  The additional effortis not too difficult or expensive, he noted, but it is an annoyance.andM;Integral, an IBM Business Partner, develops financail applications and humanresources (HR) software.andP;  The company's products have been running inmultiple database environments.andP;  Jeff Comport, SAA product manager, saidIntegral began developing DB2 products commensurate with IBM's annoucement ofSAA.andM;Integral had been using upload and download techniques to combine DB2 datawith DOS PC-based products, a risky territory where software can be madeobsolete overnight.andP;  The SAA guidelines lowered the risk for Integral, hesaid.andM;&quot;We see that as a big benefit of SAA.andP;  It allows us to involve ourselves intechnologies such as workstations, communications and SQL databases both onthe host and workstations,&quot; Comport said.andM;Integral has also embraced IBM's Cross Systems Product (CSP) as a developmenttool and many of the concepts of AD/Cycle as a development methodology.andP;  CSPhas a strong affinity with DB2; one can exploit direct SQL access to DB2without writing applications code.andP;  CSP can also read and write to the DB2catalog, and has a high-level language for screen definition and datavalidation.andP;  Customers then can use CSP to modify Integral's products.andM;Integral supports DB2 analysis tools from Bachman Information Systems, Inc.,andO;Burlington, Mass.andP;  Thus, customers can make changes at the Bachman analysislevel and generate optimized DB2 definitions that fit Integral's products.andM;Tesseract Corp. specializes in developing and delivering human resourcemanagement system (HRMS) solutions to large corporations.andP;  Committed to SAA,Tesseract uses the layered architecture, cooperative processing methods andgraphical user interface (GUIe that are key elements of IBM's blueprint.andO;Tesseract products have been available on DB2 since 1988.andM;The move to DB2 was market-driven.andP;  However, Tesseract's support of SAA camefrom the firm's interpretation of market direction.andM;&quot;We were already in the process of evaluating how we could retain therequirements for sophisticated applications, requirements such as the needfor central data and control from a central location, and still takeadvantage of the emerging workstation,&quot; said Mary Kay Marvin, vice presidentof marketing.andM;Using Windows 2 from Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., Tesseract developed aprototype illustrating its concept of how an SAA application would look andact.andP;  Demonstrations to both customers and IBM confirmed SAA as a strategicdirection.andM;HRMS Intuition is Tesseract's first product developed under SAA guidelines.andO;Now in beta test, Intuition is a cooperative processing application,connecting the mainframe HR DB2 data with the OS/2EE user at a PS/2workstation.andM;&quot;SAA allowed us to focus on building our products on a single platform andconcentrate on our applications rather than spending resources on developingplatforms,&quot; stated Gary Durbin, executive vice president at Tesseract.andP;  &quot;Inaddition, it has focused our clients on relational database.&quot;andM;Tesseract feels that IBM's tools and pieces are not allng to Durbin.andP;  Missingelements, he said, include communications, a consistent implementation ofSQL, and query and other relational database tools.andM;Tesseract is plugging the gaps by building tools its customers demand.andP;  Forexample, the firm has developed utilities to support replica updata of itsdatabases.andP;  To build tools that must later be pulled out in favor of IBM's isan expensive but necessary aspect of a commitment to SAA, Durbin indicated.andM;While application vendors see the value of SAA, user reaction varies fromenthusiasm to skepticism.andP;  A firm's first concern is the software's abilityto meet business needs.andP;  SAA compliance remains a technical concern.andO;Companies are testing the SAA waters by purchasing and installingSAA-compliant products.andM;&quot;DB2 is our carrot into the user's thinking,&quot; said Tesseract's Marvin.andO;Clients and prospects want production systems that support DB2, he said.andO;&quot;When we talk about SAA, we say that DB2 is our first step .andP;  .  .  and nowlet's look at additional phases.&quot;andM;Chevron Corp. of San Francisco is running Tesseracths IMS HRMS products andbeta testing Intuition.andP;  It will migrate to the DB/2 version early next year.andM;Jay F. Stright Jr., manager of Chevron's HR information system, said Chevrondid not have an HR function until 1985.andP;  &quot;We were very late geting started,so we didn't have any baggage to drag with us.andM;&quot;A fundamental requirement of a [HR] system is that it must facilitatechange,&quot; he said.andP;  Stright said that a company, as it grows, needs to knowwhere it has been and where it wants to go.andP;  &quot;Thus, a primary requirement forour [HR] system was the time relational model.andP;  That led us to Tesseract.&quot;andM;Stright said the Tesseract architecture, unlike traditional systems, allowsusers to design and make changes themselves.andM;Although Chevron had DB2 running in a test mode, the HR application will bethe first significant DB2 application.andP;  &quot;We are so committed to DB2 that weare joint-funding DB2 enhancements with other Tesseract users,&quot; said Stright.andM;Chevron has not had any problems in installing and testing the database,according to Stright.andP;  The major concerns are peripheral to the database.andO;Stright feels that DB2 is better positioned than IMS was at this point in itsdevelopment.andP;  With Intuition, users do not have to learn the details of SQL.andM;George Rogers, information systems consultant at Puget Sound Power and Light,Puget Sound, Wash., is the technical project manager for installingIntegral's payroll, personnel and time recording system.andM;SAA compliance was a factor in choosing the Integral system, but &quot;first wehave a business need to satisfy,&quot; Rogers said.andP;  &quot;Then SAA came into play inlooking at the technical practicality with which we satisfy that requirement,and also from a durability standpoint.&quot;andM;Puget Sound Pandamp;L felt that DB2 would offer more flexibility and longevity.andO;The Integral products' use of CSP was also important.andM;Rogers said there is a significant learning curve in converting to DB2, but&quot;it is easier than developing a Vsam structure.andP;  There is more flexibility,more opportunity to alter decisions without having to restructure the datadesig.&quot;andM;Rogers said he has not experienced any significant problems.andP;  &quot;We like DB2.andO;We like the flexibility and are quite confident that we can keep it tuned forour applications.&quot;andP;  His one concern is performance.andP;  However, since thecompany has been workign with DB2, performance is continuously improving.andM;Vendors commiting to SAA are conscious of the risks.andP;  Bill Leckonby,president of Tesseract, said, &quot;This is an investment, and an investment for areturn that we don't know when is going to come.&quot;andM;SAA, with its emphasis on the relational model and cooperative processing, ischanging the way applications are developed.andP;  It is encouraging a morecareful architecting of applications that will be advantageous to both vendorand user organizations in the long run--despite the fate of SAA.andM;Right now, Comport said, &quot;Vendors have made SAA more of an issue in theselection process than it would be from just the customer point of view.&quot;andM;However, he said that functional requirements are increasingly demandingcapabilities that can only be delivered by SAA technology.andM;Rogers said, &quot;From a user perspective, we really don't have a need for SAAtools yet, but these will come as vendors get their products to market.&quot;andM;GARTNER ANALYSIS:andM;DATA MANAGEMENTandM;Data management constitutes much of the foundation of SAA (the other maincomponent being CUA on programable workstations).andP;  In fact, it makes sense tothink of the entire SAA Common Programming Interface (CPI) as extending thenotions and functions provided by the four relational database managers--DB2,SQL/DS, OS/2EE Database Manager and SQL/400.andM;SAA data management delivers two promises--application portability supportand a means of enabling a &quot;single-system image.&quot;andM;Application portability is a difficult and complex concept, and involves manyfacilities besides database management.andP;  But database management, through theSQL programming interface, can account for over half the work involved inportability.andP;  If IBM solves the problem of database programming portability,then its customers will have moved halfway toward application portability.andM;However, one must look deeper than application portability to discover a keybusiness impact of SAA database management: programmer training andproductivity.andP;  While application portability per se is not a widespread userrequirement, every IBM customer is concerned about programming costs.andP;  By(making significant progress toward) uniformizing the programming interfacefor much installation data, IBM is contributing toward containment of thosecosts.andM;Nonrelational data (stored in IMS/DB and Vsan files) falls outside thisrealm.andP;  The existence of such data will dilute the impact of costcontainment.andM;The main business impact of SAA data management will result from thesingle-system image thrust--to an end-user of a programmable workstation, thelocation of (relational) data will not be a concern.andP;  SAA facilities willretrieve and update data automatically in response to a user's commands.andO;That data could be located anywhere.andM;What will be the business impact of this database-level connectivity?andP;  IT canamplify the effectiveness of the existing corporate software inventory.andP;  Itmay also enable business to better exchange data with clients.andM;In other words, by extending the reach of the software already in place, this&quot;single-system image&quot; may increase the return on the total dollars investedin electronic equipment.andM;Of course, for all these benefits, there is the question of whether IBM'sdatabase management strategy needed SAA.andP;  Many observers feel that IBM wouldhave delivered distributed database capabilities without SAA.andP;  Nevertheless,SAA gets &quot;credit&quot; for the benefits of distributed database technology.andM;Rich is president of PFS, Inc., El Segundo, Calif., a consulting firmspecializing in the design and deployment of end-user-oriented databasesystems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
