WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vietnam's foreign minister said Sundaythat a delay in finding a settlement to the Cambodian conflict maydelay withdrawal of his troops from the country.   ``The best is a political solution, but we must prepare for theworst ... If others don't want an early solution, then we must beprepared for the worst,'' Nguyen Co Thach told a news conference atthe second round of multilateral peace talks.   He repeated earlier promises that Hanoi would pull out its forcesby September if a political settlement can be reached by Cambodia'swarring factions. Otherwise, the withdrawal could be delayed untilDecember 1990, he said.   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered through a five-year war, areign of terror by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1978, the Vietnameseinvasion on Christmas Day 1978, and a continuing guerrilla war.   Millions have died in the land also known as Kampuchea.   After years of deadlock, the warring parties and their neighborsmet informally in July in the first tentative step toward peace.   The three-day gathering that opened Sunday is the second attemptto end the Vietnamese occupation and push the tenuous negotiationstoward an international conference on the country's future.   The key players in the negotiations are Vietnam, the governmentit set up in Phnom Penh in early 1979, and a three-factionresistance coalition.   Also attending the talks are reprsentatives from Laos and theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations _ Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei,Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia.   Indonesia arranged the talks as Asean's go-between with itscommunist neighbors.   Thach's remarks and a speech by Prime Minister Hun Sen of thePhnom Penh government appeared designed to put early pressure on theresistance coalition and their allies.   ``The position of the two Kampuchean parties are still quite farapart,'' Hun Sen said in prepared remarks.   ``Postponement would only delay the Vietnamese armed forces'withdrawal and the supply of military aid as well as to only prolongthe foreign interference into the Kampuchean conflict,'' he said.   The resistance coalition includes the Khmer Rouge, by far thestrongest militarily; anti-communists led by former Prime MinisterSon Sann, and followers of former head of state Prince NorodomSihanouk.   Sihanouk, who heads the coalition, boycotted the Jakarta meetingbecause Hun Sen rejected his plans for peace. Hun Sen's own peaceplan has been rejected by the other side.   Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranaridh, told the news conferencehe was representing his father and would also function as spokesmanfor the coalition. Sunday's opening consisted mostly of formalitiesand a dinner.   Mutual consultations were planned Monday morning with a plenarysession in the afternoon.</TEXT></DOC>
