Throughout the power plant,subsystems and components are carefully monitored to ensure they do notreduce the reliability and availability of the overall power system.Catastrophic failures, such as the Gallatin rotor burst in 1974, theshrunk-on disk rupture at Hinkley Point in 1969, and the generator retainingring failure at Barsebeck, Sweden, in 1979, have emphasized the failurepotential of rotating components and the need for adequate periodic inspectionmethods. Catastrophic turbine or generator rotor component failures cancause severe financial losses, endanger personnel, and, in nuclear plants,damage safety-related equipment. Consequently, inspection and evaluationof these components have become vital to a comprehensive power plantmaintenance program. EPRI has sponsored development of improved inspectionand evaluation methods for predicting the remaining life of turbine andgenerator rotors. The role of this program at the EPRI NDE Center isto evaluate and transfer certain turbine and generator examination andlife assessment methods to the utilities. These activities include: evaluationand improvement of examination technology; development and documentationof examination capability databases; improvement, promotion, and maintenanceof life assessment codes; and rapid response assistance on utility site-specificproblems. The activities of the NDE Center are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
