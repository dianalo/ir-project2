L. 94-484, the Health Professions Educational AssistanceAct of 1976, requires the Secretary to establish, by regulation, criteriafor the designation of Health Manpower Shortage Areas (HMSAs). The regulationssetting forth these criteria are codified at 42 CFR Part 5. This noticeproposes changes to Appendix C of the existing regulations, now entitled``Criteria for Designation of Areas having Shortages of Psychiatric Manpower'',which is organized in three parts: Part I_Geographic Areas, Part II_PopulationGroups, and Part III_Facilities. This notice would revise these criteriato include clinical (or ``health-service-provider'') psychologists, clinicalsocial workers and psychiatric nurse specialists, as well as psychiatrists,in the designation of mental health manpower shortage areas. The proposedchanges are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>When the original (interim-final) regulations for HMSA designation werepublished in 1978, the inclusion of other-than-psychiatrist providers ofmental health services in defining mental health manpower shortage areaswas considered. However, neither sufficient data nor an acceptable methodologyfor including such providers was then available. Therefore, the mentalhealth component of the HMSA criteria, as finalized in 1980, was basedsolely on the services of psychiatrists; the presence or absence of otherpractitioners providing mental health services was not taken into account.However, various developments since then have increased the focus on other-than-psychiatristmental health service providers. Their numbers have increased; certificationand licensure of these professionals has increased, as well as the numberof States requiring licensure and/or certification; and many have achieveddirect reimbursement status. Increasing emphasis on cost containment hasresulted in higher utilization of these other mental health service providers.Managed care facilities such as health maintenance organizations and outpatientclinics have increasingly used psychologists, clinical social workers and/orpsychiatric nurse specialists in the provision of mental health services,including both diagnosis and treatment. In addition, more data on the variousmental health service providers are available now than when the originalHMSA criteria were developed, together with the results of additional studiesof the mental health service system. Since 1981, the Department's Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) has conducted and/or reviewed the results of various relevant surveysand research studies in order to develop a methodology for designationof mental health manpower shortage areas. These included a national surveyof psychologists, research on the relative roles of psychiatrists and primarycare physicians, a series of research and development studies of possiblemental health manpower shortage criteria (conducted by Mathematica PolicyResearch, Inc.), review of other relevant research literature and extensivein-house analysis. In these efforts, HRSA worked closely with the Department'sAlcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, and particularlyits National Institute of Mental Health; with the associations representingmembers of the four core provider disciplines involved, namely the AmericanPsychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the NationalAssociation of Social Workers, and the American Nursing Association; andwith consultants from all four disciplines. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions of Mental Health Service Providers </ITAG>The Department is proposing to use the following definitions of ``core''mental health service providers, consistent with the definitions of themost highly-trained mental health service providers as recognized by thevarious associations involved: (1) ``Core mental health service providers'' includes those psychiatrists,clinical (or health-service-provider) psychologists, clinical social workersand psychiatric nurse specialists who meet the definitions below. (2) ``Psychiatrist'' means a doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathy(D.O.) who (a) is certified as a psychiatrist or child psychiatrist bythe American Medical Specialties Board of Psychiatry and Neurology or bythe American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry, or, if notcertified, is ``board-eligible'', i.e. has successfully completed an accreditedprogram of graduate medical or osteopathic education in psychiatry or childpsychiatry, and (b) practices patient care psychiatry or child psychiatryand is licensed to do so, if required by the State of practice. (3) ``Clinical (or health-service-provider) psychologist'' means an individual(normally with a doctorate in psychology) who is practicing as a clinicalor counseling psychologist and is licensed (or certified) to do so by theState of practice; or, if licensure (or certification) is not requiredin the State of practice, an individual with a doctorate in psychologyand two years of supervised clinical or counseling experience. (Schoolpsychologists are not included here because they are not available directlyto the general population.) (4) ``Clinical social worker'' means an individual who (a) has a master'sdegree in social work and two years of supervised clinical experience (includingthose individuals certified as a clinical social worker by the AmericanBoard of Examiners in Clinical Social Work and/or listed on the NationalAssociation of Social Workers' Clinical Register), and (b) is licensedto practice as a social worker, if required by the State of practice. (5) ``Psychiatric nurse specialist'' means a registered nurse (R.N.) who(a) has a master's degree in nursing with a specialization in psychiatric/mentalhealth and two years of supervised clinical experience (including thosecertified by the American Nurses Association as a ``psychiatric and mentalhealth clinical nurse specialist''), and (b) is licensed to practice, ifrequired by the State of practice. Less data are available on the numbers and functions of psychiatric nursespecialists than for the other core mental health service providers. However,this lack of data does not pose a major problem because of their relativelysmall numbers, particularly in relation to geographic designations. Substantialportions of master's level psychiatric nurses work in State and countymental hospitals, or in teaching or administrative positions which areexcluded by the criteria. With regard to master's degree psychologists, there are little or no nationaldata comparing their detailed activities with those of doctorate clinicalpsychologists and the other providers. The data on the number of master'spsychologists are also more limited than those for the other provider groups,which would make it difficult to develop and apply a numerical standardwhich specifically includes them. Master's psychologists also have lessstandardized training and practicum than those in the other disciplines.Thus, while many master's psychologists are undoubtedly well qualified,many others have had more limited training than the other disciplines.Requiring licensing as a criterion to identify qualified master's psychologistspartially remedies this problem, but providers in institutional settingsoften do not need to be licensed. Primary care physicians, a group which clearly provides some mental healthservices, were omitted for several reasons. First, the mental health workof primary care physicians is only a small part of their diverse functions.They typically see less severely afflicted patients and see them for shorterand less numerous visits than do the mental health specialists. The ``core''mental health providers identified above provide approximately two-thirdsof all mental health visits. Moreover, needs for primary care physiciansare already addressed by the primary care HMSA criteria, based on the entirespectrum of activities of primary care physicians. <ITAG tagnum="84">Methodology </ITAG>Ideally, mental health needs would be determined by combining measuresof the prevalence of specific mental disorders in diverse types of geographicareas or population groups with information on the mental health manpowermix required to treat these disorders and its availability in the geographicareas involved. This could probably best be done using the so-called ``modular''approach. In this approach, various ``modules'' or functional groupingsof mental health service needs would be computed from prevalence measuresapplied to population data for the area involved. Recognizing that certaintypes of services can be supplied by only one discipline (or by fewer thanall four), or are more commonly supplied by one or more disciplines, whileothers can be provided by any of the four, it then would develop estimatedrequirements ranges for each type of provider based on the needs modulesfor the area. Gaps as compared with the existing supply of mental healthproviders in the area would then be computed. Unfortunately, sufficiently accurate small-area epidemiological data isnot available to calculate the needs modules for the diverse types of areaswhich comprise the potential mental health manpower shortage areas. Dataon the exact degree of functional overlap among the various mental healthprovider types is also not available; results of HRSA-sponsored studiesmentioned above, which recommended the ``modular'' approach, also indicatedthat additional surveys of sample populations drawn from all four providertypes would be necessary to define the relevant matrices for determinationof the manpower ranges for the different provider types required to meetthe different modular needs of different areas and populations. However, the research reviewed by HRSA also indicates that, despite theirsignificant differences, the four core mental health service provider typesoften perform similar roles, especially in the provision of verbal psychotherapyand the treatment of less severe conditions. The research results availablealso suggest that the different disciplines make similar diagnoses andhave similar therapeutic results. Published reports on mental health indicatethat the degree of functional similarity among the core mental health serviceproviders is generally greater in less well-served rural areas and outsideof State and county mental hospitals (where severe cases predominate).At the same time, psychiatrists are the only mental health professionalswho can prescribe medication. (Although other core mental health serviceproviders also deal to some extent with patients on psychotropic medicationprescribed by physicians with whom they are linked.) Psychiatrists alsohave more patients with schizophrenia and major affective disorders, morecases of higher severity, and more patients on major psychotropic medicationthan do the other core mental health service providers. Thus, it is importantthat a mental health service area should have some psychiatrist coverage,at least a portion of a full-time-equivalent. In the criteria used until now for designation of HMSAs having shortagesof psychiatric manpower, as in the criteria for other HMSA types, population-to-practitionerratios have been the major variable. Despite their shortcomings, population-to-practitionerratios have been selected for continued use as the primary measure of healthmanpower shortage, consistent with the recommendations of HRSA's 1983 ``Reportto Congress on the Evaluation of Health Manpower Shortage Area Criteria.''The use of population-to-practitioner ratios also has the advantage ofplacing less burden on applicants than more complex methods. In order to consider at the same time both the unique services performedby psychiatrists and the partial interchangeability of the four core mentalhealth service providers in performing many functions, joint criteria havebeen developed which use both the population-to-psychiatrist ratio andthe population-to-all-core-mental-health-service-provider ratio. To determineshortages, threshold ratios were chosen based on data on the total numberof patient care providers in the various core mental health service professions.The following table shows the latest available national data on numbersof U.S. non-Federal patient care full-time-equivalent (FTE) core mentalhealth providers, together with the ``adequate'' and ``shortage'' ratiosthey suggest. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Latest Estimates for Total U.S. Full-Time-Equivalent (FTE) Non-FederalCore Mental Health Service Professionals in Patient Care and for Population-to-Core-ProviderRatios</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">1988</ITAG><H1>Discipline </H1><H1>U.S. total estimated number of FTEs </H1><H1>Mean U.S. population-to-FTE provider ratio </H1><H1>Suggested ``adequate'' pop-to-FTE ratio </H1><H1>Suggested ``shortage'' ratio criterion</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Psychiatrists\1\ <D>26,099 </D><D>\5\9,326:1 </D><D>10,000:1 </D><D>15-20,000:1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clinical Psychologists\2\ <D>29,100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clinical Social Workers\3\ <D>31,800 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Psych/MH Nurse Specialists\4\ <D>1,320</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1+2+3+4 (all) <D>88,319 </D><D>\5\2,756:1 </D><D>3,000:1 </D><D>4,500-6,000:1 </D><F>\1\ 31,070 (1987 American Medical Association data for non-Federal patientcare psychiatrists plus child psychiatrists) x .84 (representing 48 hoursper week x 70% of time in direct patient care)*. </F><F>\2\ 48,500 (1985 estimate of Stapp et. al. updated with unpublishedMay 1988 growth estimate from the American Psychological Association) x.60 (42 hours per week x 57% of time in direct patient care)*. </F><F>\3\ 60,000 (1988 National Association of Social Workers unpublishedestimate) x .53 (37 hours per week x 57% of time in direct patient care)*.</F><F>\4\ 1500 (1988 NIMH unpublished estimate) x .88 (35 hours per week,according to the 1984 Survey of Nurses). </F><F>\5\ 243,400,000 (June 1987 U.S. Bureau of the Census provisional estimatefor the U.S. Population) divided by previous column. </F><F>*Professional hours per week and percent time in direct patient carefrom Knesper et al., ``Similarities and Differences Across Mental HealthServices Providers and Practice Settings in the United States,'' in ``AmericanPsychologist'', December 1985, p. 1356.</F></ITAG></ITAG> As the last column of the preceding table indicates, the ``adequate'' ratiochosen by rounding up from the national mean would be 10,000:1 if psychiatristswere considered alone, and 3,000:1 if all core mental health providerswere counted. These are the levels which the proposed new criteria usefor measuring overutilization in contiguous areas_i.e., contiguous areaswith ratios above these levels cannot be considered to have excess capacityusable by residents of the area requested for shortage designation. For purposes of HMSA designation, an area is generally considered to havea shortage when its population-to-provider ratio is 1.5 to 2.0 times thenational mean. Thus the basic shortage threshold ratios proposed here are15-20,000:1 for psychiatrists alone and 4,500-6,000:1 for all core mentalhealth providers. The lower levels would be used in the criteria for areaswith unusually high needs indicated; the higher levels for areas withoutunusually high needs. <T3>Degree-of-Shortage Groups. </T3>A table has been constructed (see below)which illustrates how the two ratio variables can be used together in thedetermination of shortage. Areas with no core mental health service providersare considered to have the greatest shortage and are therefore shown inGroup 1. Second are those areas having some core providers, but no psychiatrists,and a core provider ratio worse than the basic core provider shortage criterion.Third would be all those areas which meet both the basic core providershortage criterion and the basic psychiatric shortage criterion. The fourth and last group would consist of all other areas which meet amore stringent criterion (2-3 times the national mean) on either one ratioor the other. The threshold levels proposed for this group are 20-30,000:1for psychiatry alone (the same as the previous psychiatric shortage criterion)and 6-9,000:1 for all core providers. The following table summarizes the degree-of-shortage groups, in termsof the ratio (R<T2>C</T2>) of population to number of FTE core-mental-health-service providers(FTE<T2>C</T2>), the ratio (R<T2>p</T2>) of population to number of FTE psychiatrists (FTE<T2>p</T2>), and the presence or absence of high needs.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2(0,4,4),i1,s10,xs64,xls16,r15</C><T4>Degree-of-Shortage Groups for Mental Health Manpower Shortage</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>  </H1><H1>  </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="21">High Needs Not Indicated</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 1 <D>FTE</D><T2>C</T2>=0 <D>and </D><D>FTE</D><T2>p</T2>=0. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 2 <D>R</D><T2>C</T2> gte* 6,000:1 <D>and </D><D>FTE</D><T2>p</T2>=0. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 3 <D>R</D><T2>C</T2> gte 6,000:1<D>and </D><D>R</D><T2>p</T2> gte 20,000. </ITAG>Group 4(a) For psychiatrists placements only: Regardless of R<T2>C</T2>, all other areas with FTE<T2>p</T2>=0 or R<T2>p</T2> gte 30,000Group 4(b) For other mental health service practitioner placements only:All other areas with R<T2>C</T2> gte 9,000:1 regardless of R<T2>p</T2><ITAG tagnum="21">High Needs Indicated</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 1 <D>FTE</D><T2>c</T2>=0 <D>and </D><D>FTE</D><T2>p</T2>=0. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 2 <D>R</D><T2>C</T2> gte 4,500:1 <D>and </D><D>FTE</D><T2>p</T2>=0. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Group 3 <D>R</D><T2>C</T2> gte 4,500:1<D>and </D><D>R</D><T2>p</T2> gte 15,000. </ITAG>Group 4(a) For psychiatrists placements only: Regardless of R<T2>C</T2>, all other areas with FTE<T2>p</T2>=0 or R<T2>p</T2> gte 20,000Group 4(b) For other mental health service practitioner placements only:All other areas with R<T2>C</T2> gte 6,000:1 regardless of R<T2>p</T2><F/><T4>Note: </T4>In the above, ``gte'' means ``greater than or equal to''.</ITAG><T3>Rational Service Areas. </T3>The geographic areas to be consideredfor designation are the mental health service or catchment areas recognizedin current State mental health systems and plans. In most cases, theseare derived from the mental health catchment areas developed in the 1970'sby the States in conjunction with the National Institute of Mental Health.As before, in some cases a portion of a catchment area or a county whichincludes more than one catchment area can be considered.<T3>Determination of Unusually High Need for Mental Health Services. </T3>Inthe criteria for psychiatric shortage areas, special consideration (i.e.,lower shortage threshold ratios and higher degree-of-shortage groupings)has been given to areas of unusually high need for mental health services.Such areas were identified as those with two or more of the following ``highneed'' indicators: poverty, high proportion of elderly or youth, or highprevalence of alcoholism. In the amended criteria, we propose to use onlypoverty. The poor obviously have financial barriers to service and oftentransportation barriers as well. The age-related indicators are being droppedbecause more recent data (from the NIMH Epidemiological Catchment Areasstudy) do not support the proposition that either youths or elderly personshave a higher relative prevalence of mental illness or use of mental healthservices. We also propose to drop the use of alcoholism as a high needindicator, since the alcoholism index originally referenced in the criteriais no longer maintained nationally, nor is any other national alcohol indexreadily available, making it difficult for applicants to provide comparabledata. Other demographic and social environmental indicators are being exploredin mental health needs assessment studies, but specific ones for whichdata are now available have not yet been identified.<T3>Population Groups. </T3>The criteria for designation and populationgroups with mental health service shortages (within geographic areas wherethe general population is adequately served) would also be revised to considerall four core mental health services providers; the numerical thresholdlevels and degree-of-shortage groups proposed are the same as those discussedabove for high-need geographic areas. (The population groups which maybe considered here are the same as those defined in the ``Guidelines onDesignation of Population Groups with Health Manpower Shortages'' publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 5, 1982.)<T3>Facilities. </T3>This notice also proposes to revise the methodologyfor determining a facility's capacity to meet the psychiatric needs ofthe population it serves by allowing for consideration of visits to allcore mental health service providers, not just to psychiatrists. Communitymental health centers and other public or nonprofit private facilitieswill thus be considered to have insufficient capacity to meet the psychiatricneeds of the designated area or population group it serves if there aremore than 1,000 patient visits per year per FTE core mental health serviceprovider on staff of the facility, or more than 3,000 patient visits peryear per FTE psychiatrist, or if no psychiatrists are on the staff andthis is the only facility providing (or responsible for providing) servicesto the designated area or population.In addition to the above proposed changes, this notice would replace theterm ``psychiatric'' with the term ``mental health'' throughout AppendixC, where appropriate, along with other changes of a clarifying and technicalnature.<T3>Minimum Size of Shortage. </T3>One problem with the methodology usedup until now for primary care, dental and psychiatric HMSA designationswas that it resulted in designation of areas which meet minimum ratio requirementsbut would require placement of less than one full-time practitioner toremove the area from the list. This result is appropriate for those ``frontier''and other remote rural areas having no practitioners and small populationsbut needing some coverage; but it also resulted in the inclusion of areasand population groups which already had at least one practitioner and reallydid not need additional ones. This is even more of a problem given thedeclining numbers of practitioners now available for placement throughthe National Health Service Corps; areas which have some practitionersand require less than one additional should not be competing with thoseareas which have none and/or need at least one additional practitioner.Therefore, a minimum computed need for at least 1.0 additional FTE coremental health service providers (and a minimum computed need for at least1.0 psychiatrists in the case of psychiatrist placements), has been addedas a shortage criterion for those otherwise designatable areas (and populationgroups) which already have at least 0.2 FTE core providers available tothem. For consistency, the analogous change has also been made to the primarycare and dental HMSA criteria; i.e., a minimum computed need for at least1.0 additional FTE primary care physician (or dental practitioner) in thoseotherwise designatable primary care (or dental) HMSAs which already haveat least 0.2 FTE primary care physicians (or dental practitioners) availableto them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Secretary certifies that this amendment to the regulations does nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Most areas designatable under the previous criteria will also be designatableunder the revised criteria, although their degree-of-shortage group maychange. Some previously-designated primary care and dental HMSAs will nolonger be designatable as a result of the new minimum size-of-shortagecriterion; however, these will generally be former HMSAs which had verylow priorities for placement and thus were not likely to receive NHSC personnel.When both psychiatrists and other core mental health service providersare considered, some new mental health HMSAs will be designatable. However,since the number of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) obligated psychiatrists(or other core mental health service providers) available for placementin mental health HMSAs is limited, only a few placements will occur innewly-designated areas. The data on designated mental health HMSAs andinformation on changes to existing HMSA designations resulting from thisamendment will be available to the States for their use in carrying outState loan repayment programs. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 is not required.Further, this rule will not exceed the threshold level of $100 millionestablished in section (b) of Executive Order 12291. For these reasons,the Secretary has determined that the rule is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and a regulatory impact analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>There are no information collection requirements in this regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 5</ITAG>Mental health, Health, Health professions, Psychiatrists, Clinical psychologists,Clinical social workers, Psychiatric nurses, Primary care physicians, Dentists.Accordingly, 42 CFR Part 5 is proposed to be amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
