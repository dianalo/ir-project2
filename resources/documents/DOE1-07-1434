It isshown that the contribution of ionospheric and longitudinal currentsinto magnetic disturbances in polar caps turns out to be comparable.The similar situation is also true for disturbances in the D componentin an auroral zone. Ionospheric currents define nearly absolutely theH-component behaviour in an auroral zone.</TEXT></DOC>
