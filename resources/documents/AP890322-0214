Authorities and the opposition decided to prolong historicnegotiations on Poland's future into an eighth week during hagglingover the powers of a new president and senate.   The Sejm, or parliament, began considering Wednesday thegovernment's package of bills meant to transform accords from theround-table talks into law.   Constitutional changes on the agenda included creating a freelyelected senate and a strong presidency. Also up for discussion werelaws on elections in June, trade unions, clubs and associations andfarmers' unions.   The laws were only being introduced and referred to committees,but several in the 460-member chamber protested that they wereexpected to rubber-stamp decisions made in the talks.   Wiktor Leyk, a non-party member of parliament affiliated with theChristian Social Union, was applauded when he said the talks shouldnot ``replace constitutionally appointed legislative and executiveinstitutions.''   Opposition and government negotiators meanwhile were trying toresolve remaining obstacles to a final agreement. The governmentpromised that any agreements reached can be inserted into the billsbefore the Sejm votes on them.   In a setback for the talks' timetable, Solidarity spokesmanJanusz Onyszkiewicz announced Wednesday there was no hope ofconcluding an agreement before the Easter holidays. Thenegotiations, due to end Thursday, will stretch into next weekbecause Wednesday's talks were going too slowly, he said.   Opposition sources said it appeared uncertain an April 3 targetdate for signing the final accord could be met.   But Politburo member Janusz Reykowski told reporters, ``There hasbeen nothing that would make us think this date would be changed.''   Both sides reported agreement Wednesday on granting independentgroups access to state-controlled mass media. The opposition waspromised a daily newspaper and two weeklies, and permission to actas host for a national radio show and a TV show. Censorship is to beeased.   No progress emerged on an opposition demand for indexed payraises to counter Poland's 60-percent-plus inflation. Solidarity hasvowed to sign no agreement without indexation.   The general aspects of the accord have already been settled.   Solidarity and other opposition groups banned since the 1981martial-law crackdown would be legalized. In exchange, they wouldagree to take part in Sejm elections in which a communist-controlledcoalition would be guaranteed 65 percent of the seats.   But a senate would be created to which elections would be totallydemocratic. For the first time in the communist bloc, oppositioncandidates would be free to run and compete directly againstcommunist candidates.   The price for a freely elected senate is creation of a statepresident with strong powers serving a six-year term. The presidentwould be elected by the Sejm and the senate, and the Communist Partycould count on obtaining the office.   In the parliamentary debate, the communist-allied DemocraticParty called for another major reform: a law to allow independentpolitical parties to form for the first time since 1948. But it saidsuch parties should be regulated.   The constitution does not mention the possibility of formingpolitical parties other than the Democratic Party and the UnitedPeasants Party _ both named in the constitution as junior partnersof a communist-led ruling coalition.   But in the recent reform climate, several political ``clubs''have sprung up that say they would like to act as independentpolitical parties.   ``The Democratic Party demands a separate law on politicalparties, regulating the form of their establishment and theprinciples of their relations with other legal entities,'' saidDemocratic deputy Jerzy Wojcik.   Several deputies expressed concern that decisions taken at theround table threatened to diminish parliament's constitutionalauthority.   Non-party deputy Malgorzata Niepokulczycka complained the Sejmwas being used to give ``hurried approval'' to round-table accords.   Another deputy, demanding anonymity, angrily remarked during abreak in the session, ``We have always been told the Sejm is thesupreme authority in this country and now it turns out the mostcrucial decisions were taken somewhere else.''   Reykowski said deputies should not feel mistreated. He said thetalks represent a joint appeal for action by a spectrum of socialforces, but ``the decisions must be made by the organs which areauthorized by law.''   Because the Sejm is controlled by communist party deputies whoare bound by party discipline, any legislation agreed upon by theparty leadership in the past has always been assured of passage.</TEXT></DOC>
