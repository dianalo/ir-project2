Six Flags, an Arlington, Texas, operator of amusementparks throughout the U.S., is regarded by analysts as apromising company hobbled with an excess debt load. In 1990,Six Flags had a $25.4 million loss on revenue of $431.3million. The company had $55 million of profit beforeinterest and taxes, but those operating earnings were swampedby an $80.2 million interest bill.</LP><TEXT>   Six Flags was taken private in 1987 in a $600 millionleveraged buy-out led by executives of Wesray Capital Corp.,a New York leveraged buy-out firm. Six Flags' stock isclosely held and isn't traded on any exchange. But becauseits high-yield junk bonds are publicly registered, Six Flagsmust file regular financial reports with the Securities andExchange Commission.   In its latest earnings report, Six Flags disclosed that itmay have to &quot;seek the protection of the federal bankruptcylaws&quot; if it can't modify certain credit agreements withbanks. Those agreements have been repeatedly amended in thepast year, as Six Flags' losses continued to mount.   In an interview, Six Flags' controller, Andrew Barkley,sought to minimize the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing.&quot;That's just legal language,&quot; he said. &quot;It was added for fulldisclosure of all the alternatives at the company'sdisposal.&quot;   Mr. Barkley said Six Flags earlier this week got itslending banks to agree to modify certain credit agreementsuntil June 30. Six Flags has borrowed about $217 million froma bank syndicate led by Security Pacific Corp., Mr. Barkleysaid. If the company hadn't gotten those amendments, it couldhave been declared in default of its loan agreements.   Six Flags said it will need additional amendments afterJune 30 to stay in compliance with bank-loan agreements. Itsaid that if such amendments can't be maintained, the companywill need to refinance its debt, raise equity capital, sellassets or seek bankruptcy-law protection.   Six Flags said it is &quot;actively considering variousrefinancing alternatives, but there is no assurance that suchalternatives will be agreed upon or successfullyimplemented.&quot;   Time Warner currently owns 31.8% of Six Flags and holdsvarious options that would let Time Warner boost its stake tomore than 80%. Most of Time Warner's investment was made lastyear.   In its latest SEC filing, Six Flags disclosed that TimeWarner on March 15 acquired preferred stock in Six Flags fromBally Manufacturing Corp. Bally had owned Six Flags until theamusement-park operator was sold to the Wesray executives in1987.   Six Flags has about $300 million of high-yield junk bondsoutstanding. Those bonds had traded as low as 30 cents on thedollar last year. But traders said the bonds have ralliedsince then to about 60 cents on the dollar, buoyed by news ofthe Time Warner investment and by a general junk-bond rally.   An active buyer of Six Flags bonds last year was the WaterStreet Recovery Fund I, managed by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. ButWater Street's managing partner, Mikael Salovaara, saidyesterday that he has sold his Six Flags holdings.</TEXT></DOC>
