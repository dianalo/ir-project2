Add a heap of more specific problems and the provision of healthcare in prisons becomes a constant struggle.   Doctors and nurses, in great demand in the outside world, mustbe recruited to work for civil service wages in steel-barsurroundings. A federal program that helped in this search, theNational Health Service Corps, which allowed doctors to pay offschool loans by working in prisons, was dismantled by the Reaganadministration.   The patients are murderers, rapists, drug dealers and thieveswho bring a hodgepodge of untreated ailments into prison.   Overcrowded cellblocks sizzle with the fear of AIDS, as well astuberculosis and other contagious diseases. Prisons are beingforced to open costly geriatric units to treat chronic heart, lungand other conditions of graying inmates.   And the source of relief for many other societal ills, the statelawmaker, has been more likely to dole out condemnation thancompassion for criminals who can't vote.   Inmates' advocates say quality medical care in prisons iselusive despite court orders, national guidelines and more moneygrudgingly given.   ``There's a general contradiction in providing health servicesand locking people up in steel cages. Prisons deform everybody,''said Robert Cohen, former medical director at New York City'sRikers Island Prison and an expert medical witness in health-caresuits.   Added Armond Start, medical director of the Wisconsin prisonsystem, ``Prisons are the most anti-therapeutic places there are.''   Too, most Americans feel indifferent about prisoners' rights.   ``Prisoners are a pariah kind of constituency,'' said EdwardKoren of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``We treat them likegarbage. You leave it outside in the trash can and don't want tosee it again. Nobody cares, unless it comes back again.''   Said Minnesota inmate Henry Jackson, a 69-year-old sex offenderwho has diabetes and high blood pressure, ``We're just dogs. We'renothing.''   Medical care, however, is a legal obligation.   A 1976 Supreme Court ruling said ``deliberate indifference toserious medical problems of inmates constitutes cruel and unusualpunishment.'' It made prisoners the only class of U.S. citizenguaranteed health care by the government.   But having the right to care doesn't guarantee Mayo Clinic-styletreatment. Because no federal or state authority has spelled outwhat constitutes adequate medical care, quality is a matter ofcourt interpretation. Since 1982, only 10 percent of the nation's600 prisons have met voluntary guidelines set by healthprofessionals.   The following court cases are all based on prison care providedsince the guidelines were issued:   _Six inmates died at a Pittsburgh prison in the last two yearsafter getting ``appalling, shocking and dangerously inadequate''medical care, according to Cohen, who testified in May in a federalcase brought by several inmates. Cohen said an AIDS-afflictedprisoner died of pneumonia, a diabetic from lack of insulin; theother deaths are alleged to have resulted from improper diagnosisand treatment of heart attacks and cancer.   _At Minnesota's Stillwater Prison, one-third of the 1,200inmates and at least five guards were infected with tuberculosisfrom 1982 through 1986. The first case wasn't diagnosed until sixmonths after the inmate went to sick call, and officials waited twoyears after inmates filed suit to test the prison for the air-bornegerm.   _A 25-year-old convict died in May 1987 during an asthma attackat Deer Island House of Corrections, a pre-Civil War lockup nearBoston. According to a current wrongful death suit, the man wasturned away from the infirmary at the 8 p.m. lockup, and the guardswho dragged him to his cell ignored agony so intense that theinmate urinated as he was hauled up three flights of stairs.   _Hospitalized inmates from Rikers Island were shackled to bedframes and watched by guards until 20 months ago. They includedAIDS patients, pregnant women and inmates on life support systems.``They were too ill to get out of bed, much less get out of thebuilding,'' said Dale Wilker of the Prisoners Rights Project, whichsued to have the shackles unlocked.   _At New York's Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women,several patients had to be hospitalized because dentist DonaldCollings' drill slipped in their mouths while he was drunk,according to a 1984 suit filed by the Prisoners Rights Project.Collings resigned, and the state paid damages of $650,000.   Medical care remains a favorite target of lawsuits filed by U.S.inmates, who totaled a record 627,402 in January.   Courts have ordered eight states and Puerto Rico to improveprison health care throughout their systems and are demandingcorrective action at individual prisons in 30 other states.Lawsuits are pending in five states, according to the ACLU.   Still, there is unanimous agreement that prison medical care hasbeen bettered since courts prescribed legal remedies.   Robert Brutsche, who served 19 years as medical director of theFederal Bureau of Prisons before retiring in 1988, said care had``improved by light years. The changes are like night and day.''   One indication of progress is funding.   The states spent $80 million on prison health care in 1975 and$215 million in 1980, according to a 50-state survey by TheAssociated Press. The health-care costs this year will be about $1billion, or about 8 percent of the $16 billion tab it costs tohouse inmates, according to national estimates.   Michigan spends the most of any state, an average of $7.58 perday for prison health care, according to Corrections Yearbook.Hawaii spends the least, $1.14. The national average is $3.57.   The tide of reform began 15 years ago, when federal Judge FrankJohnson found ``barbarous'' and ``shocking'' conditions in Alabamaand for the first time placed an entire state system under federalcontrol.   Johnson said ``unsupervised prisoners without formal trainingregularly pull teeth, screen sick-call patients, dispense as wellas administer medication, give injections, take X-rays, suture andperform minor surgery.''   The conditions, which inmates' attorney Matthew Myers called``symptomatic of a national crisis,'' included these atrocities:   _A quadriplegic's bedsores developed into open wounds and wereinfested with maggots. His bandages weren't changed in the monthbefore his death.   _An inmate who was supposed to get intravenous feeding receivedno nourishment for three days before his death.   _An inmate who'd had a stroke was forced to sit on a bench so hewouldn't dirty his bed. But he fell so frequently his legs becameswollen and crippled, and he died a day after one leg was amputated.   Alabama bettered conditions enough that federal control waslifted last December.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
