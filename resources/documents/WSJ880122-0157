The current account comprises trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers. The bank said the deterioration in the current account stemmed largely from a decline in the merchandise-trade surplus, which fell to 1.2 billion kronor in November from 2.1 billion kronor a year earlier and 1.9 billion kronor in October.    In 1987's first 11 months, the currrent account swung to a deficit of four billion kronor from a year-earlier surplus of 7.5 billion kronor, as the trade surplus fell to 19.7 billion kronor from 30.9 billion kronor. </TEXT></DOC>
