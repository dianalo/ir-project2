Butanalysts say that because it was too focused on personal computer networkingissues, it failed to aggressively pursue a number of fast-growing markets,especially those aimed at companies trying to connect many different kinds ofmachines, including large computer systems.;   As a result, 3Com in recentyears has been forced to watch its own revenues decline while sales atcompanies such as Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park have in some cases morethan doubled from year to year.;   Earlier this year, 3Com announced thelayoff of 12 percent of its staff, along with a $45 million write-off.;   Atthe same time, though, 3Com's top management announced a new direction for thecompany. Analysts say that Monday's announcement showed it to be living up tothose promises.;   &quot;They really are coming out with products focused on highgrowth opportunities,&quot; said Brad Baldwin, an analyst with the Gartner Group.&quot;This is good stuff. The technology is significant.&quot;;   Baldwin gave 3Com agood shot at becoming an important participant in these new networkingmarkets, even though the growth potential they represent is attracting moreand more companies into the field.;   Praise for 3Com's efforts came even fromcompetitors.;   &quot;Clearly, their product direction is right,&quot; said Terry Eger,vice president of sales and product marketing at Cisco.;   Eger said, though,that there is a large software component to networking products and said itwas not yet clear if 3Com's software was as robust as its hardware initiallyappeared to be.;   3Com said its new NETBuilder II router device will cost$16,870, compared with the $23,500 to $42,000 it said other firms charged forsimilar products. Prices for the LinkBuilder 3GH hub run from $27,500 to$150,000.;   To make sure the world noticed it was trying to reinvent itself,3Com also changed the design of its logo Monday, putting a box around the lastthree letters of its name.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE GOMES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910924  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  427  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 24, 199100268021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
