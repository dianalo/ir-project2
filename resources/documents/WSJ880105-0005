Erythropoietin, a hormonal substance, stimulates red blood cell formation.    Amgen's complaint asks the commission to investigate Chugai's importation of the substance as an act of unfair competition, and to prohibit any further importation.    The biotechnology concern filed a patent infringement suit against Chugai in October, a spokesman said. Amgen was awarded a patent for erythropoietin in October. </TEXT></DOC>
