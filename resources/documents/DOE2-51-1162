Based on thermodynamic and known kinetic considerations, ironand copper were selected as the cations for the study, along with CO,H{sub 2}, and NH{sub 3} as the reducing/regeneration gases. Various techniqueswere studied to provide maximum cation exchange, including impregnationtechniques to obtain cation loadings in excess of the maximum theoreticalion-exchanged amounts. Single adsorbent column tests were performed usingsimulated flue mixtures and test conditions to evaluate the preparedmaterials and selected regeneration gas combinations. Attrition testswere performed on the cation-exchanged materials to determine if theprocedure may degrade the physical strength of the adsorbents. A microprocessor-controlled,automated test apparatus was fabricated and assembled to provide unattended,continuous operation for bench-scale tests for the selected materialsand gas combinations. A total of about 50 adsorption-regeneration cycleswere performed using two sets of 3-ft-long adsorbent columns. Major conclusionswere: (1) greater than 90% SO{sub 2} removal and greater than 80% NO{subx} removal were demonstrated, (2) adsorbent regeneration was obtainedwithout the use of steam, (3) a high utilization of the exchanged copperwas attained, and (4) a hydrogen regeneration gas utilization of hydrogenwas demonstrated. 32 figs., 28 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
