Many traders and oil analysts were skeptical about how long the oil-price rally would last, insisting that a renewal of peace between the warring oil producers would only increase the flow of oil into a glutted world-wide market.    But traders also speculated that peace would help restore unanimity to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose production-controlling efforts have been hampered by the hostilities of the two member nations. Such speculation caused a rally to begin at midmorning in European spot markets, then to sweep across the Atlantic to send futures prices soaring in the U.S.    &quot;It was basically straight up,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, a vice president for futures for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc in New York.    The effects cascaded into other markets world-wide. The rekindling of inflation fears sharply depressed bond prices from Europe to the U.S. In the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.56 to 2117.89 on the news.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, closed at $15.70 a barrel, up 84 cents from Friday's close. During the day, however, the benchmark crude had traded as high as $15.90 and as low as $15.25. In European markets, the widely traded North Sea Brent settled late in the day at $15.10, up from $14.05 on Friday.    Despite yesterday's jump, oil prices remain as much as $3 a barrel below their 1988 peaks in the spring.    Much of the initial bullish mood in oil markets yesterday was based on perceptions that OPEC will be in a stronger position to curb excess production once hostilities end. The positive mood was swelled by reports yesterday that Saudi Arabia has dropped its objections to a meeting of the cartel's price-monitoring committee.    Although senior OPEC officials would neither confirm nor deny the reports, it is understood that the five oil ministers who make up the committee now are tentatively planning to meet either late this month or in early August. They can, if they choose, call for an emergency ministerial conference of OPEC to consider cuts in output.    Also, Saudi Arabia has figured prominently in recurring speculation, which it has repeatedly denied, that it and other Arab producers supporting Iraq had been trying to drive down the price of oil to hurt Iranian revenue. Analysts said yesterday an end to the war would eliminate any such motivation by the Arab producers, if it exists.    &quot;The most positive thing {for oil markets} is the potential of easing conflicts in the OPEC group,&quot; said Kenneth Miller, a senior principal in the Purvin andamp; Gertz oil-consulting firm.    Also, Mr. Miller said, Iran has been a staunch supporter of higher prices. &quot;So it's not likely to flood the market,&quot; he said.    But several others wondered whether an end to the Iraq-Iran war might open the oil floodgates wider. A cease-fire or any lull in the war will open the Persian Gulf to more tankers, they noted, and that will mean a larger flow of crude oil into a world market that already is near saturation.    Longer term, some analysts said, both Iraq and Iran will want to increase oil output to finance the rebuilding of their war-torn economies. &quot;Iraq is certainly going to put the pedal to the metal on production,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, director of Shearson's international energy desk in London.    &quot;There's been a bit of knee-jerk reaction, but projections that prices have to go markedly upward suggest a superficial grasp of the fundamentals,&quot; said Humphrey Harrison, oil analyst at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat andamp; Aitken. </TEXT></DOC>
