Leading the list of big bids in Tenneco's auction was Chevron Corp.'s $2.6 billion offer for Tenneco's energy reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. The purchase will make Chevron the nation's biggest producer of natural gas -- ahead of Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc. -- and represents a bold bet that long-depressed natural-gas prices have hit bottom.    &quot;Chevron is bullish on natural gas,&quot; said Willis J. Price, president of the Chevron U.S.A. unit. Added Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman-elect: &quot;There's more upside potential in gas than oil.&quot;    The sales prices obtained by Tenneco, which exceeded Wall Street estimates, were particularly impressive in light of the recent severe slump in energy prices. But Tenneco counteracted the plunge partly through a flat-out, last-minute wildcatting effort, which discovered significant new reserves as the auction process was under way -- adding, by one insider's estimate, as much as 10% to the total bids.    Among the other winning bidders:   --Amoco Corp., Chicago, agreed to pay $900 million for Tenneco's Rocky Mountain division, which, like Chevron's purchase, mostly involves natural gas -- a 75-year supply, in fact. The purchase will help make Amoco a leading supplier to the burgeoning natural-gas markets of California and indicates that the company hasn't retreated from its acquisition-minded strategy following its recent $4 billion purchase of Canada's Dome Petroleum Ltd.    --Mesa Limited Partnership, Amarillo, Texas, after several years of laying low, agreed to pay $715 million for Tenneco's midcontinent reserves, including an area loaded with gas called the Hugoton, where Mesa already has a large position. Along with some earlier acquisitions, the Tenneco transaction will help double Mesa's natural-gas reserves.    --Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles, said it agreed to pay as much as $700 million for Tenneco's West Coast reserves, which will more than double the company's California oil production.    --American Petrofina Inc., a Dallas-based dark-horse bidder that is 85% owned by Petrofina S.A., Brussels, will pay $600 million for Tenneco's Gulf Coast producing properties. The purchase -- again, largely involving gas -- more than doubles American Petrofina's energy reserves in the U.S., elevating the Belgian-controlled concern into a major holder of U.S. energy supplies.    --Mobil Corp., New York, raised industry eyebrows by agreeing to buy Tenneco's newly upgraded Chalmette, La., refinery for a rich $560 million, outbidding government-owned Petroleos de Venezuela and American Petrofina. Industry officials had estimated the mid-sized refinery would sell for at most $400 million. But Allen Murray, Mobil's chairman, said the company expects to capitalize on &quot;steadily tightening&quot; refining capacity in the U.S., which, in turn, has helped to sustain gasoline prices and oil-company profits.    --The Houston-based Conoco Inc. unit of Du Pont Co. agreed to pay $115 million for Tenneco's Norwegian oil and gas reserves in the North Sea; Conoco was a partner with Tenneco on many of the properties.    --Seagull Energy Corp., Houston, will buy $16 million of Gulf Coast properties, which, combined with other acquisitions, will double its revenue from oil and gas production.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. managed the auction for the reserves, while First Boston Corp. handled the refinery and gasoline stations.    The sales eliminate Tenneco as one of the nation's largest oil companies, leaving it with interests as varied as shipyards, natural-gas pipelines and tractors. Tenneco decided to sell its oil-and-gas unit to help reduce its huge debt, and has hinted at a stock buy-back as well.    Tenneco's board is scheduled to meet today, when the company is expected to disclose further details about the sale, as well as possible additional restructuring plans.    Wall Street was especially interested in what Tenneco's net proceeds would total, with estimates ranging from $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Tenneco's stock advanced $1 to close at $49.75 in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading of 2.9 million shares, after rising $1.125 on Friday.    Tenneco didn't announce any of the winning bids or the number of participants yesterday, choosing to let the buyers make their own disclosures if they cared to. It wasn't immediately clear who won the bidding for Tenneco's roughly 450 gasoline stations, which could fetch around $170 million, although a group of closely held companies was said by trade sources to have a good chance of winning.    Neither was it announced who won the bidding for Tenneco's lucrative Colombia properties or a small package of other international reserves. Industry speculation centers around Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Gas PLC.    Among the losing bidders was Joe B. Foster, who headed Tenneco's oil company and strongly objected to its sale -- and who could well submit his resignation from the company as early as today. Mr. Foster had assembled a group seeking to buy some of the properties he managed through a leveraged buy-out. &quot;We did not win,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;It's a good price. Tenneco did very well,&quot; he added, declining to comment further.    The other non-winners, most notably Exxon, were in many ways as noteworthy as the winners. It is believed that Exxon was outbid for several reserve packages, leaving it with a lot of cash that could still be earmarked for acquisitions. At the Houston Petroleum Club, industry officials couldn't eat lunch of late without discussing speculation that Exxon was going to walk away with all of the Tenneco properties. An Exxon spokeswoman said it was company policy not to comment on anything to do with acquisitions.    Another big non-winner was Pennzoil Co., which decided not to use any of the $2.6 billion proceeds from its legal settlement with Texaco to make a bid. The company has said it is still looking for an acquisition, however. Texaco itself chose not to bid, feeling it would be inappropriate because it's in the midst of its own massive restructuring.    Bidding, in fact, was thin, according to people familiar with the auction. The sheer size of the Tenneco sale eliminated many oil companies, while some companies that could afford to bid chose not to, figuring they would would lose to the biggest of the oil concerns. Nonetheless, the slack demand and sharply reduced energy-price environment didn't stave off a successful auction.    &quot;It would have been a good price a couple of months ago,&quot; said one industry official, &quot;and it's a great price today.&quot;    Chevron said the acquisition signals an end to three years of asset sales and retrenchment since the $13.3 billion Gulf Oil Corp. merger in 1984. &quot;We're now in a financial position where we can take advantage of our opportunities,&quot; Mr. Derr, the chairman-elect, said in an interview. Chevron said at least 75% of the purchase will come from its cash reserves, which totaled $4.6 billion at the end of the first half.    Mr. Derr said Chevron, like others in the industry, expects oil prices won't increase sharply over the next five years or so, though he thinks natural-gas prices will rise. He said that even if gas prices didn't change for 10 years, Chevron would have made a good investment with the Gulf of Mexico reserves.    Chevron common stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $44.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Amoco's acquisition surprised some people in the industry, because it came on the heels of the Dome purchase. &quot;We don't have any way of controlling when these kinds of opportunities come along,&quot; said Bill Lowrie, an executive vice president for Amoco's production unit. &quot;We couldn't afford to pass it up.&quot;    Soon after the release of Amoco's news, company officials heard industry speculation that the company had overpaid. But Mr. Lowrie said the company's evaluation determined there was greater potential in the properties than could be immediately perceived.    Mesa said it will finance its $715 million property purchase with existing credit lines, working capital and a new $430 million bank credit line arranged for the acquisition. The oil and gas partnership said the purchase will increase its reserves by about 30%.    The acquisition, however, won't help Mesa with its most immediate need, generating enough cash flow to cover the $2-a-unit annual distribution on its common ownership units. Because of low natural-gas prices, Mesa has had to rely on investment gains and borrowing to maintain the distribution for the last two years. Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday said it was reviewing certain Mesa debt for a possible ratings downgrade because of the acquisition.    A Mesa spokesman said the cash flow from the new properties initially will be used to pay down debt incurred to buy them, but said, &quot;After you get out a little ways, these properties should contribute significantly to our cash flows.&quot;    Mobil's acquisition of Tenneco's refinery may enable it to close down or curtail operations at an old, inefficient refinery it operates along the Texas Gulf Coast. Earlier this year, Mobil announced costly modification plans for the refinery.    Mobil officials were unavailable to comment.    &quot;They could probably buy the whole Tenneco refinery for what they'd spend fixing up the other,&quot; said Thomas Manning, vice president of the consulting firm Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc., Houston. In addition, the Louisiana refinery could supply gasoline to Florida, an area where Mobil has been trying to expand, Mr. Manning said.    ---           Tenneco: History's Biggest Oil Auction         Winning bids for pieces of oil and gas unit                                          APPROX.
