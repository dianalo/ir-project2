The effects arosen fromelectron shell rearrangement and dynamic screening of proton charge ina solid, on the electron stopping are studied for case of solid targets.The calculation results are compared with experimental data and withapproximate calculations based on sum rules and local electron densityapproximation.</TEXT></DOC>
