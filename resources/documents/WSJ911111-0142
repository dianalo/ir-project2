During the same period, the survey found, the number ofemergency homeless shelter beds earmarked for the mentallyill decreased 3%, while the number of Single Room Occupancyunits specifically for the mentally ill homeless decreased1.4%. But transitional housing units for the mentally illhomeless increased by an average of 7% in the 22 citiessurveyed in the report.</LP><TEXT>   At a news conference where the study was released, RaymondFlynn, mayor of Boston and president of the mayors' group,said that more mentally ill people are homeless because ofrecent cuts in state budgets for mental health. During thepast decade, he said, mentally ill people have been moved outof big mental hospitals to smaller mental-health centers.&quot;Now they're even closing the small facilities,&quot; he said. Mr.Flynn said the lack of affordable housing also contributed tohomelessness among the mentally ill.   The report, which was based on a survey of city officials,didn't attempt to estimate the homeless population. The 1990census counted 228,621 homeless people, a figure that eventhe Census Bureau considers too low. A widely respected tallyby the Urban Institute placed the number at 600,000.   Roughly a third of all homeless people are mentally ill,the mayors' report said, echoing similar estimates made inearlier studies.</TEXT></DOC>
