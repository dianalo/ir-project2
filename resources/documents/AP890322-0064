Kenneth G. Racca Jr. of San Diego was charged in federal courtTuesday with importing and possessing one gram of marijuana. He wasreleased on a $10,000 signature bond and ordered to return for ahearing Thursday.   The 28-year-old crewman faces up to five years in prison on theimportation charge and up to one year for possession.   Customs Service district Director George Roberts said in astatement that an intensive search of the 196-foot Thomas Washingtonturned up 4.5 grams of marijuana in a Racca's berth, but the chargesaccuse him of having only one gram.   The research vessel is owned by the Navy and chartered to theScripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego. It docked atHonolulu Harbor Monday after a trip to American Samoa. Customsspokesman Art Morgan said the marijuana was found during a routinesearch later that day.   The Thomas Washington is the prestigious institute'ssecond-largest research vessel, Scripps officials said. It left SanDiego nearly a year ago for research in the Pacific.   The ship could be returned to Scripps after an administrativepetitioning process and payment of a fine, Morgan said. The vesselwas scheduled to leave Saturday for another 30-day research cruise,but customs officials said they didn't know whether it would bereleased by then.   The last customs seizure of a research vessel under thegovernment's ``zero-tolerance'' anti-drug policy took place May 19in San Diego, when a small amount of marijuana and drugparaphernalia were found aboard the Atlantis II.   The ship was returned to its owner, the Woods Hole OceanographicInstitution of Woods Hole, Mass., after a crew member pleaded guiltyto a drug charge.</TEXT></DOC>
