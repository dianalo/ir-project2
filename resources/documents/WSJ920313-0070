The report showed that, among smokers aged 12 to 18, thevast majority prefer three brands: Marlboro, Newport andCamel. Those same brands, according to federal healthofficials, were among the most heavily advertised cigarettesin the U.S. in 1990. By contrast, preferences among adultsmokers weren't nearly as concentrated.</LP><TEXT>   While researchers have long maintained -- and the tobaccoindustry has long denied -- that some advertising promotessmoking among children, few statistics have been available tobolster either argument. In recent months, however, studiesin the Journal of the American Medical Association, and nowthe CDC report, indicated that some marketing efforts arehighly successful in winning adolescent loyalties.   The CDC's study &quot;dispels the notion that kids aren'tinfluenced by this advertising,&quot; said Donald Shopland,coordinator for the National Cancer Institute's smoking andtobacco control program. &quot;You have the industry saying: `Kidsdon't pay attention to this stuff; it's only directed atadults.' But the brands that children are buying do show thatthey pay attention.&quot;   The report comes on the heels of a demand made earlierthis week by the U.S. surgeon general, Antonia Novello, thatRJR Nabisco voluntarily halt its &quot;Old Joe&quot; campaign for itsCamel cigarettes. The food and tobacco company, based in NewYork, and its tobacco subsidiary, based in Winston-Salem,N.C., have indicated they have no plans to change the ads,which feature cartoon characters.   A spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. dismissed theCDC's findings. &quot;No matter what country you look at,&quot; saidMaura Payne, the spokeswoman, &quot;advertising doesn't play asignificant role in decisions to begin smoking. It's alwaysthe influence of friends and family that matters most.&quot;Officials at Philip Morris Cos. in New York, maker ofMarlboro, and Lorillard Inc., a unit of Loews Corp. in NewYork and maker of Newport, couldn't be reached for comment.   The CDC's survey of 1,396 teen-agers found that 69%preferred Marlboro, 8.2% preferred Newport, and 8.1%preferred Camel. That tight grouping, according to thereport, which contains three of the most heavily promotedcigarettes in the country, &quot;suggests that tobacco advertisingmay influence teen-agers in their choice of brands.&quot;   With regard to Marlboro cigarettes in particular, thereport said teen-age smokers &quot;may be attracted to the brand'simage of strength and independence promoted in thelong-running `Marlboro man' advertising campaign.&quot;   Among black adolescents, mentholated brands were thecigarette of choice. Sixty-one percent said they preferredNewport, 11% bought Kool and 10% Salem.   The contrast with adult smokers was striking. Amongindividuals aged 25 to 64, Marlboro was again themost-preferred cigarette -- but only among 24% of thosesurveyed. Next was Winston with 11%, followed by Salem, 8.8%.Camel and Newport had 6.1% and 5.6%, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
