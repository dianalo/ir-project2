This procedure has emerged as a noninvasive technique to aidin the detection, localization, and quantification of myocardial necrosis.Infarct-avid scintigraphy has potential advantages over other techniques,including serum enzyme tests, electrocardiography, and vectorcardiography,which provide indirect evidence of the presence, size, and location ofan infarcted region of the myocrdium. These indirect techniques are usuallysatisfactory for detecting infarction, particularly during its earlystages, but are less useful for measuring the extent of irreversibletissue damage.</TEXT></DOC>
