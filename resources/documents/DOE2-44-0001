Current Soviet hard currency earnings are mainly derived fromsuch exports; due to the size and immediacy of currency requirements,the industry has tended to maximize short term production at the expenseof exploration and development. 1987 production and exports were at recordhighs, but future production and exports are limited by reserves anddevelopment requirements. Industry limitations, such as overproductionin older fields, low levels of capital efficiency, and increased investmentcosts operate to slow development. New policies which may counteractthis tendency include legislation allowing joint ventures, requirementsfor self-financing of enterprises, and promotion of energy efficiency.One forecast shows a decrease in production and exports to 10 millionand 0.5 million bbl/d, respectively, by the turn of the century; moreoptimistic Soviet reports suggest a production increase to 13.2 millionbbl/d which would allow exports of up to 2.2 million bbl/d. The secondscenario would only be possible with greatly increased Siberian production;it is felt that the two forecasts provide upper and lower limits to thepossible outcomes. In any case, the level of these exports will likelycontinue to affect world oil prices. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
