(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of captive American journalistTerry Anderson says the U.S. government has decided ``to let thesemen die'' rather than to pursue the release of its hostages as theFrench did.   ``It almost appears that the French government places a higherpriority on the lives of their people,'' Peggy Say said Thursday.   Three French hostages, including one who said he was a cellmateof Anderson, were released Wednesday by their pro-Iranian captors.High-ranking officials of the French government apparentlynegotiated for their release.   The U.S. government, however, refuses to negotiate withterrorists as a matter of principle and joined Great Britain inexpressing hopes that the French did not make a deal for thehostages.   ``I find it rather embarrassing that they would call France totask for making a deal in view of the fact that this governmentsold arms to Iran in a poorly conceived initiative that might havefreed the hostages,'' said Mrs. Say, who has spoken out severaltimes on behalf of her brother and the eight other Americanhostages believed held in Lebanon.   ``I hope they pursue whatever channels the French used, but Idoubt they will,'' Mrs. Say said. ``I'm not a political wizard ...but it seems to me that their rationale that they won't negotiatebecause they want to bring an end to terrorism ... is irrational.   ``What they are saying is that they know of no other solution tothis situation than to let these men die,'' she said.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, has been held since March 16, 1985, the longest of anyhostage.   One of the freed French hostages, Marcel Fontaine, said he wasAnderson's cellmate and that he recently played chess and dominoeswith him.   ``It's good to know Terry is alive, but I'm afraid this doesn'tnecessarily mean anything will be forthcoming,'' Mrs. Say said fromher upstate New York home. She said she would fly to Paris thisweekend to meet with Fontaine.   Earlier, Mrs Say said that the release of the French hostageswas encouraging because she might be able to learn from them abouther brother's condition.   ``They must have talked and maybe he knows something about whatTerry is thinking,'' she said. ``I'm hoping he can give me someindication of what I should do next.''</TEXT></DOC>
