Business Week spokeswoman Mary McGeachy said Thursday thatMcGraw-Hill Inc. was investigating the magazine's editorial staffas well as employees in its four printing plants to determinewhether market-sensitive information was being leaked in advance ofpublication.   McGeachy said that ``some time back'' the company's legalcounsel began tracking stocks mentioned in the ``Inside WallStreet'' column after noticing unusual rises and heavy tradingvolume in those stocks on the day Business Week was printed butbefore it reached newsstands.   She said no employees had been suspended or fired.   Although the cause of the movements has not been determined, theprobe is reminiscent of a case involving a Wall Street Journalreporter who gave a stockbroker advance information on columnsexpected to move stock prices.   All Business Week employees are informed as part of theirorientation that they are obligated to disclose their stockholdings to the editor in chief and will not report on thosecompanies, McGeachy said.   Mary McCue, a spokeswoman for the Securities and ExchangeCommission in Washington, declined to comment on whether the agencyis investigating the matter. Spokespeople for the New York StockExchange had left their offices for the day when called for comment.   The presses begin rolling out Business Week in the early morningeach Thursday at plants in Connecticut, Wisconsin and California,which produce the U.S. edition, and in Pennsylvania, which producesthe international edition.   The magazine, which has circulation of 962,000, is shipped todistributors on Thursday and is released to the news media afterthe stock market closes that day.   McGeachy said the suspicious stock movements occurred on severalThursdays. According to a story from Dow Jones ProfessionalInvestor Report on Thursday, of the 20 stocks mentioned in the lastseven ``Inside Wall Street'' columns, eight rose sharply on heavyvolume for no apparent reason the day the issue was printed.   For example, a week ago Gradco Systems Inc. jumped $1 a share to$9.75 on more than five times its average daily volume. The stockwas mentioned favorably in the column of the Business Week issueavailable to the public the following day.   Gene G. Marcial, author of the column, told Dow Jones, ``We'vebeen very much aware of when it happens.''   McGeachy said McGraw-Hill checks the magazine's securitymeasures each week and monitors stock movements followingpublication.   ``Volumes and stock prices typically move on Fridays andMondays,'' she noted, but that is after the magazine isdisseminated to the public. ``We're very aware of the impactBusiness Week has on the markets.''   McGeachy said it was not unheard of for printing plant employeesand drivers to be offered cash for advance copies of somemagazines, but she did not include Business Week in that category.   McGraw-Hill's investigation was not limited to Business Week'seditorial staff, she said. ``It covers the entire operation,''including the company's printing plants, she said.   In 1985, reporter R. Foster Winans of the Wall Street Journalwas convicted of wire fraud by passing tips to a stockbroker aboutitems scheduled to appear in the financial newspaper's influential``Heard on the Street'' column.   Winans' conviction was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in1987. The decision, however, failed to clarify whether such casesconstitute insider trading.   Winans was sentenced to 18 months in prison for leakinginformation to former Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. broker Peter Brant, whowas sentenced to 120 weekends in jail and fined $10,000 afterpleading guilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
