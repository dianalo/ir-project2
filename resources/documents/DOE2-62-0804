The useof the disturbance monitored data in the evaluation and design of theprototype relay is described. Information is given on the performanceof the relay during high level disturbances resulting from faults. Thepaper concludes with the results obtained when using two such relaysin a directional comparison scheme during staged fault throwing testson the UK 400 kV system.</TEXT></DOC>
