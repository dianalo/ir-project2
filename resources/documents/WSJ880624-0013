Terms weren't disclosed, but George Adler, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said the price could be around $150 million.    The wood-products and paper company said the Jim Walter businesses, which had 1987 sales of $300 million, will be merged into its Butler Paper unit, which had 1987 sales of $800 million. A company spokesman said the acquisition &quot;improves our geographic profile by giving us a good position in the South.&quot;    Great Northern Nekoosa said it expects to complete the transaction in the third quarter, subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and the expiration of applicable regulatory waiting periods.    Hillsborough Holdings, was organized by an investor group led by the leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which bought Jim Walter Corp. in January for $2.44 billion. In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the debt is paid off with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Great Northern Nekoosa shares closed yesterday at $46.75 each, up $1.25, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
