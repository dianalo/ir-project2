The dollar closed at 132.30 yen, up 1.03 yen from last Friday'sclose. The U.S. currency opened at 131.68 yen and moved in a rangeof 131.67-132.30 yen.   The dollar opened slightly higher than last Friday's close of131.27 yen, but active buying of the dollar by insurance companiespushed it further, currency dealers said.   They attributed the dollar's bullishness to the market's reducedwariness toward rising interest rates.   ``There seem to be no strong incentive to sell the dollar rightnow,'' said Masato Sanjo, a dealer at the Tokyo office ofManufacture Hanover Trust. ``The bullish dollar appears to havebecome more like a long-term trend.''   Another currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there wassome demand for the dollar in early trading but otherwise themarket was ``very quiet'' as most overseas markets were observing athree-day Easter holiday from last Friday.   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 20.14-pointloser last Friday, shed another 56.12 points, or 0.18 percent, toclose at 31,512.40.   On the stock market, dealers said the anticipation of theintroduction of the capital-gain tax starting April 1 led to heavysale of shares, resulting in a lower Nikkei index.   Investors currently pay a 0.55-percent securities tax whenselling shares, but from April 1, they will pay 1.3 percent intaxes _ 1 percent in capital gain tax and 0.3 percent for thesecurities tax.   Also, in anticipation of the indictment of former chairan ofNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. for bribery charges in astock-trading scandal, NTT shares closed at an all time low of 1.53million yen. Its previous low was 1.58 million marked on lastWednesday.   But dealers expressed optimism, saying market environments arenot as bad as the Nikkei indicates.   ``The fact that Nikkei fell only less than 0.2 percent despiteall the bad news indicates the deep-down bullishness of themarket,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage in Tokyo. ``Once allthe bad news is out, it will be time for the spring rally.''</TEXT></DOC>
