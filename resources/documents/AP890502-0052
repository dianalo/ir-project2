Increased precipitation has relieved drought conditions in manyareas, including parts of the Rockies that were ravaged by firelast year, Brown said in a telephone interview. But uncertainprospects for more wet weather in coming months still cloud thefire outlook, he said.   Weather forecasters ``tell us that from May to July we haveequal chances of above-normal or below-normal precipitation andabove-normal or below-normal temperatures,'' said Rob Harper of theWashington state Department of Natural Resources. ``That basicallysays it's unclear what the outlook is.''   Ironically, the improved precipitation could heighten the dangerof range fires in many areas by promoting the growth of grass thatcould serve as fuel later, Brown said.   Brown, who is responsible for outdoor fire danger forecastsnationwide, said he was compiling data for a report due to bereleased late this week.   The biggest danger area is the Southwest. Much lower-than-normalwinter snowfall and spring rains pose a fire threat in Arizona andNew Mexico and southern parts of California, Utah, Nevada andColorado.   ``There's not much question ... (of) a great potential rightnow'' for wildfires in those areas, Brown said. ``The fuels arealready drying out.''   Soil and debris on the forest floor in parts of northern Arizonaare as dry now as they were in August, he said.   The next greatest fire potential is in the intermountain region_ northern portions of Utah and Nevada, southern Idaho and parts ofeastern Oregon and Washington _ where the snowpack is meltingrapidly and the long-range forecast calls for warm temperatures,Brown said.   Scott Kaiser of the National Weather Service in Boise said thesnowmelt in Idaho was ``10 to 14 days ahead of normal,'' reducing asnowpack that was normal as of mid-April to 80 percent to 85percent of normal now.   Despite four small forest fires during a warm, windy spell lastweekend in Washington, the outlook for the Pacific Northwest,Northern California Northwest and the northern Rockies is nearnormal, Brown said.   The largest blaze, a 308-acre fire on Washington's OlympicPeninsula, was stopped dead by cooler, damper weather Monday, saidWarren Hartman of the U.S. Forest Service. Containment was expectedtoday.   The Rockies, including fire-ravaged Yellowstone National Park,``have gotten their fair share of precipitation,'' leading to``quite a decrease in the drought conditions that existedearlier,'' Brown said.   The situation could deteriorate, however, as high pressure andrelatively dry weather is likely to remain over the middle of thecountry for the next 30 days, he said.   Last year, the Boise command center recorded 7,250 wildfires onmore than 5 million acres of land _ an area more than 1{ times thesize of Connecticut. That was 30 percent more than the 1983-87annual average number of fires and 137 percent more than theaverage annual acreage.</TEXT></DOC>
