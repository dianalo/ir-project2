But a case appealed to the Supreme Court earlier this year gives an unusual view of just how thorny things can get.    Most investors feel that the worst thing that can happen to them is that their account will suffer a string of losses. This case shows that something worse can happen: an account may be kept barely solvent while its equity is drained by trading commissions.    In 1980, David Jordan, a retired certified public accountant living in Kansas City, Mo., had come to doubt his ability to trade commodities profitably. Rather than quit, he moved his trading account to the local office of Clayton Brokerage Co., a now-defunct commodity broker based in St. Louis.    There, according to evidence submitted in the case, matters went from bad to worse, and Mr. Jordan eventually took Clayton to court. In 1986 a federal district court jury in Kansas City accepted Mr. Jordan's claim that he was injured by Clayton and a Clayton broker.    So what happened to Mr. Jordan? From Feb. 3 to March 13, 1981, the broker made 84 trades in Mr. Jordan's account, and the value of the account fell by $7,923, according to Mr. Jordan's attorney and an expert witness for the plaintiff. Most of the drop -- a total of $5,292 -- was a result of brokerage commissions.    Leslie Jordan, a Chicago-based expert witness for Mr. Jordan and no relation, testified that in order for the account to simply pay the commissions, it would have had to generate profits of more than 182% a month. A widely followed federal court ruling and a Commodity Futures Trading Commission standard have declared that when commissions climb above 16.67% of the account's equity value, that gives an investor reason to suspect excessive trading.    But unlike many instances of alleged excessive trading where the accounts quickly run out of money, Mr. Jordan's account never went broke.    At the trial, Mr. Jordan's attorney, Matthew Partin, argued that Mr. Jordan was the victim of a plan to turn the money in his account into brokerage commissions over a period of time.    Mr. Jordan's attorney submitted evidence -- including order tickets and testimony by a former assistant of the broker -- that the attorney claimed showed that the broker switched four profitable trades totaling $1,489 from another account into Mr. Jordan's account so that Mr. Jordan's account wouldn't be wiped out and trading could continue. The broker wasn't a defendant in the case.    On another occasion, again using order tickets as evidence, Mr. Jordan's lawyer alleged that the broker switched two profitable trades from Mr. Jordan's account into an account in the name of &quot;Xochlit Flores,&quot; purportedly a Kansas City beautician whose only known address listed on Clayton's records, according to Mr. Jordan's lawyer, was a post-office box across the street from Clayton's branch office. Mr. Jordan's attorney said that his investigation showed there was no &quot;Xochlit Flores&quot; and that the account was controlled by the broker.    Mr. Jordan said in an interview that he called the broker periodically to complain, but &quot;he would just ignore it. He would always come up with some story -- a lot of technical gabble about the market.&quot;    In the trial, James W. Hanson, a broker with Clayton, testified that in 1979 and 1980, while he was branch manager of Clayton's Kansas City office, he investigated customer allegations that the broker engaged in discretionary and excessive trading in accounts that were listed as nondiscretionary. (A discretionary account is one in which the broker has the right to enter trading orders without informing the owner of the account.)    As a result of his investigation, Mr. Hanson concluded that the broker had been making unauthorized trades in two customer accounts. He also testified that he informed his superiors in Clayton's home office of his conclusion. Despite this information, Clayton relieved Mr. Hanson of his position as branch manager and promoted the broker to that position.    Another employee, who was fired by the brokers, testified she met with an employee of Clayton's compliance department in St. Louis and informed him that the broker was engaged in switching orders from one account to another. The appeals court decision said that the record contained ample evidence for the jury to conclude that Clayton knew that the broker was engaged in the order switching scheme.    John Cowden, a Kansas City lawyer who handled Clayton's 1986 appeal to the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, declined to comment on the jury verdict. Attempts to contact Clayton for comment were unsuccessful, as were attempts to contact the broker through one of his attorneys.    Mr. Jordan was awarded damages of nearly $8,000 and a punitive award of $400,000. The jury also found that Clayton under Missouri common law had breached its fiduciary duties because of self-dealing. The appeals court upheld the lower court in October 1988.    In March of this year, attorneys for Clayton petitioned the Supreme Court to review several points in the case, but their request has not been acted on. One of the grounds for appeal was that Clayton's right under the Eighth Amendment to be free from excessive fines -- in this case, 50 times actual damages -- was violated.    Clayton, which sold much of its assets in 1986 to Geldermann Inc., a large Chicago brokerage firm, settled similar claims of four other customers represented by Mr. Jordan's attorney after the original trial ended, according to the attorney, Mr. Partin.    Has Mr. Jordan's experience with Clayton soured him on commodities? Not at all. Mr. Jordan said in the interview that he will consider trading commodities again when his case is finally concluded. </TEXT></DOC>
