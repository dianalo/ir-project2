NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, negotiated the agreement aftergetting the go-ahead from ATandamp;T's board. NCR has collaboratedwith Teradata and currently holds 9.4% of the company, astake that was transferred to ATandamp;T when it acquired NCR.Teradata, based in El Segundo, Calif., is considered apioneer in the leading-edge computing technology called&quot;massively parallel processing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   NCR and Teradata executives met over the weekend andquickly put together the agreement, which was approvedyesterday by ATandamp;T's and Teradata's boards. It must still beapproved by Teradata shareholders and the Securities andExchange Commission, NCR said, adding that it expects tocomplete the merger within two to three months.   NCR had to act fast because the companies' earlierdevelopment agreement allowed either one to terminate therelationship if the other was acquired, as NCR was inSeptember. Teradata moved recently to terminate thedevelopment agreement, triggering the weekend discussions,both companies said.   Teradata, which employs 1,600 people and has operations inthe U.S. and 13 countries, had a loss of $2.36 million, or 15cents a share, on revenue of $257.8 million in the fiscalyear ended June 30. NCR, which has 54,000 workers, had netincome of $369 million, or $5.43 a share, in 1990 on revenueof $6.29 billion, 60% of which came from outside the U.S. Thecomputer industry is currently in a world-wide slump that isexpected to continue well into 1992.   Under the agreement, for each Teradata share, NCR plans toexchange $30.25 worth of ATandamp;T common stock. The exchange ratewill be based on the average closing price of ATandamp;T stock --plus or minus 5% -- over a period of 20 trading days, endingfive trading days before Teradata shareholders meet to voteon the merger.   In composite trading yesterday on the New York StockExchange, ATandamp;T shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $36.25.Teradata shares rose $5.125 to close at $28.875 in heavyover-the-counter trading.   Gilbert P. Williamson, NCR's chairman and an ATandamp;T boardmember, called the merger &quot;a logical step {that} will helpensure NCR's global leadership in enterprisewide informationsystems and services.&quot;   Analysts called the merger expensive but one that ATandamp;T'sNCR desperately needed to make.   &quot;It's a very expensive acquisition, considering Teradatalost money last year,&quot; and ATandamp;T is paying about two timesTeradata's annual revenues, said George F. Colony, presidentof Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consultingfirm. However, he said, NCR has run into delays shipping itshigh-end computer, the Model 3600, which uses massivelyparallel processing technology from Teradata. &quot;Very fewpeople know about parallel processing; it's a black art,&quot; hesaid. &quot;NCR is getting an expertise injection.&quot;   &quot;It's a large transaction,&quot; said Kenneth Leon, an analystat Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;But it's not one that's material toATandamp;T's earnings, and it strengthens NCR's position inhigh-end computing.&quot;   Mr. Williamson said, &quot;The business opportunities we seemake this an appropriate value.&quot; He said that the Model 3600,while delayed by about six months, is nonetheless complete interms of development. &quot;We were anxious to preserve a group oftechnologists {and} will be able to better meet the market'sneeds together rather than separately with conflicting salesforces.&quot;   In parallel processing, hundreds or even thousands ofmicroprocessors attack pieces of a single problemsimultaneously while conventional computers crunch data onestep at a time. Analysts expect the technology to transformthe computer industry.   NCR incorporated a key parallel-processing technologydeveloped by Teradata, called the Ynet interconnect, in itsnew Model 3600, which NCR bills as the world's most powerfulcommercial computer. The Ynet helps coordinate the hundredsof electronic processors as they work out a mathematicalproblem. NCR's high-end system incorporates 288 processors,and the company is developing a machine using more than 1,000processors for introduction early next year, according to NCRexecutives.   Last month, Teradata registered with the SEC to issue newstock, the proceeds of which were to help fund its growingbusiness, including development expenses. The issue was stillpending when Teradata and NCR began their merger talks.   Teradata's largest shareholders are Brentwood Associates,a venture capital firm whose 1.56 million shares would have avalue of at least $47.19 million under the merger deal; FMRCorp., with 1.52 million shares at a value of at least $45.98million; and NCR, whose 1.49 million shares would be valuedat $45.07 million. NCR paid about $36 million in March 1990for its initial stake in Teradata. Teradata Chairman KennethSimonds's 65,000 shares should fetch at least $1.96 million.</TEXT></DOC>
