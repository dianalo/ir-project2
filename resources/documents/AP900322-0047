Jackson Walter,president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``Wewould like to preach beyond the choir.''   A national conference beginning today in Pittsburgh is one ofthe first attempts to link the common interests of preservationistsand planners, organizers said.   Jerold S. Kayden, a visiting faculty member at the LincolnInstitute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., called the two-dayconference of historic preservationists and professional planners,public officials and developers ``their debutante party.''   ``Before, they were walking down the same aisle, but they didn'trecognize each other,'' he said.   About 250 people _ from historic preservationists to land-useattorneys _ are expected to attend the conference.   Preservationists have joined the political process in ways theytraditionally were absent a decade ago, said Elizabeth Waters,mayor of Charlottesville, Va.   ``Historic preservation has moved much more toward communityplanning and development,'' she said.   Preservationists are traveling ``in pretty heavy company,''Walter said.   For example, he said, in President Bush's most recent budgetproposal, efforts to preserve America's heritage rate high on thenational agenda _ in the same realm as protecting the environmentand improving the infrastructure and transportation system.   The conference also will focus on past successes and failures inburgeoning suburban areas, many of which are turning into smallcities that are home to more than 60 percent of the nation'soffices.   Sponsors decided to hold the conference in Pittsburgh because ofits renaissance from a economically depressed city to one of thecountry's most livable, said Constance Beaumont, spokeswoman of theNational Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, D.C.   ``There just seemed to be a lot of innovative things going on,''Ms. Beaumont said. ``We thought it would be an interestinglaboratory.''   One example of the result of little preservation or planning isTyson's Corner, Va., near Washington, D.C., where there is heavytraffic with limited pedestrian areas, Walter said.</TEXT></DOC>
