Terms of the contract were not disclosed.   Mitsubishi is prime contractor for the first part of theproject, which is run by the National AstronomicalObservatory of Tokyo. The telescope, which will be located onMauna Kea, Hawaii, is scheduled for completion in 1999.</LP><TEXT>   The mirror blank will be 327 inches in diameter, weigh60,000 pounds, and measure eight inches thick. It will bemade at Corning's Canton, N.Y., plant using ultra-lowexpansion glass that Corning has developed and the company'shex-seal process, which fuses hexagonal shaped pieces to forma blank.   Corning, which has interests in optoelectronics, consumerhousewares, specialty materials and laboratory services,estimates it will take three years to produce the mirrorblank, which will be the world's largest, and another threeyears for an outside optical finisher to polish it.</TEXT></DOC>
