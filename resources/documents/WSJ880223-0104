Rollwagen offers them a cautionary message:   &quot;The people here who have been successful, like all old people, tend to reminisce. That takes the shape of design standards, specifications and documents describing the old material. Understand that those documents exist but you don't have to read any of them. In fact, I would recommend that you don't. If you do read them, please don't do anything in those books.&quot;    That's an unconventional message, the 48-year-old Mr. Rollwagen readily concedes. &quot;You've got the boss, the CEO, telling them not to follow any of the rules. But I also tell them not to rub it in. Because five years from now there will be other young people here. 'You're going to be 25 and they're going to be 20. And you'll be the ones reminiscing.&quot;'    In short, Cray doesn't want its employees -- average age 28 -- glancing backward. It is a one-product company in a dizzying race with advancing technology. Its corporate mission statement reads, simply: &quot;Cray Research designs, manufactures, markets and supports the most powerful computer systems available.&quot;    &quot;If somebody else makes the world's most powerful computer, we're in deep weeds,&quot; says Mr. Rollwagen. &quot;If nobody wants to buy the world's most powerful computer, we're also in deep weeds. So those are two very clear risks. But I believe that by taking those risks we absolutely maximize the odds that we will make the world's most powerful computer and that we'll figure out how to sell it.&quot;    Results bear out that risk theory. Cray, founded by computer guru Seymour R. Cray in 1972, had only 124 employees and revenues of just over $500,000 when it made its first public stock offering in 1976. It now has upward of 4,500 employees, revenues approaching $700 million and net earnings exceeding 20% of revenues, which makes it one of the nation's most profitable companies.    Its new Y-MP model supercomputer, just introduced, costs roughly $20 million. Yet demand for these expensive machines is rising. &quot;When we started out, we thought there were 86 customers in the whole world for this kind of computer,&quot; says Mr. Rollwagen. &quot;We could count them. In fact I knew a helluva a lot more about the market than I do now, because we've sold 189 and we're talking to another 400 people. It's just way beyond anything we ever thought about. And it's a very profitable business, so it attracts flies.&quot;    Flies such as IBM, for example. The most publicized event in Cray's recent history was the departure last year of 44-year-old designer Steven S. Chen after a disagreement over the expanding scope of his project. He and some 40 team members left to set up shop in an unused factory near Eau Claire, Wis., and soon picked up financial support from IBM.    &quot;It's pretty clear that IBM is going to come into this business,&quot; says Mr. Rollwagen. &quot;That's the bad news because IBM is a tough competitor. The good news is that if this is their shot, they've got a ways to go. It {Mr. Chen's project} is at least four or five years away and we did turn it down. Of course, we could have been wrong.&quot;    Clearly Mr. Rollwagen doesn't think he was wrong, although he concedes that IBM will learn a lot from Mr. Chen. The disagreement mainly was over parallel processing. That means dividing problems, solving the parts simultaneously, then reunifying the solutions. Cray crossed the parallel processing threshold some time ago, greatly increasing computing speed. The new Y-MP has eight processors. Mr. Chen wanted to leap to 64.    To make that jump, Cray's management calculated that Mr. Chen would have to succeed with some six other lines of research, each with a 50% probability of success. That made the overall success probability very low, in management's view.    There is a more important problem, however. Adding more and more parallel processors gradually turns a computer into a new kind of animal, a thinking machine. Developers of thinking machines now are talking in terms not of 64 processors, but 64,000 interlinked processors. The linkages, not the processors, become the central part of the technology. Cray sees too much potential in its existing business to consider, at this point, going into the thinking-machine business.    &quot;It's kind of like we make left brains. Even though they are getting more complex, it's still rational, linear, deterministic kinds of programs that we run. They {the thinking-machine people} are trying to build the right brain, where the interconnections are as much a part of the machine as the processors. What you are going to do is just get them started and they're going to go off on their own and it will be fascinating to see how this works. But I think we're really talking about decades.&quot;    Cray is interested in right now, selling its stripped down, high-speed, big memory &quot;racing&quot; machines. Mr. Rollwagen believes a market threshold has been crossed, with suddenly a whole new family of users finding that supercomputers are cost-effective. For one thing, the cost of computing power is coming down.    &quot;Within a couple of years, Apple is going to have a computer with the power of our original Cray-1 of 1976 available for about one one-thousandth of the price,&quot; says Mr. Rollwagen. &quot;Talk about price reductions. At about that same time we'll be offering a computer with 1,000 times the capability of our original for the same price as the original.&quot;    Parallel to the reduced cost has been the steady development of new software. Increasingly, it permits users to simulate experiments that would be very expensive to actually do, such as wrecking cars to test their crash-worthiness. Designs of cars or airplanes can be simulated in three dimensions by the computer, allowing engineers to test drive or test fly computer models before entering into the expensive business of building prototypes. They actually can redesign the model on the computer while they are testing it. In supersonic aircraft design, for example, the computer can simulate speeds hard to simulate experimentally even with expensive wind tunnels.    Scientists are tackling new problems of fantastic complexity, such as mapping the human genome, that are not even practical to think about without supercomputers. For other tasks, such as global weather mapping, or fitting together the complex logistics of an international airline, supercomputers are simply practical tools.    About half of Cray's Randamp;D budget now goes into creating software, a combination art and science that so totally engrosses some Cray designers that they sometimes have to be dragged away from their terminals and told to get some rest. Cray plows more than 15% of its revenues back into Randamp;D, a very high percentage even for high-tech companies. But Cray knows that with each new model it introduces, &quot;it isn't good enough to be 50% or even 100% better. You have to have multiples, a minimum of two or three times, more reasonably five, and sometimes even 10 times the capability of the previous model.&quot;    That's why Mr. Rollwagen tells his young engineers to ignore the reminiscences of their 25-year-old seniors and get on with the task of keeping Cray ahead of the pack. </TEXT></DOC>
