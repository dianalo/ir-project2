<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0665 </DOCNO><TEXT>Enhancement of the safety and security of explosive devices by solelyusing fiber optic links to the device has been a development objectivein both commercial and military applications. Much effort has centeredon the direct ignition of explosive materials by light from an opticalfiber. While such devices are beginning to emerge, the need to use highoptical power levels ans sensitive explosives has limited the approach.We have explored an indirect, but simple approach to operating an opticallycoupled detonator/igniter. This method is made possible by recent developmentsin low voltage explosive igniters combined with microcircuit series-connectedphotovoltaic arrays. They allow one to convert light from an opticalfiber to electrical energy stored in a small capacitor and to triggerits discharge, all locally within the device to produce a precisely timedexplosive ignition and subsequent detonation. This produces a componentof about the same size as existing devices, which is highly resistantto electromagnetic disturbances and driven by a diode laser through anoptical fiber. The method functions with a wide range of insensitivesecondary explosives and pyrotechnics. In this paper we will describeprototypes of the device which we have operated. Performance ranges availablewith present technology and areas of technology which will be fruitfulto develop will be discussed. 15 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
