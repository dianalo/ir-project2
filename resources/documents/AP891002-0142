East Germany demanded that WestGermany expel the new arrivals.   East Germany filed an official protest with West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, demandingthat Bonn throw out those who have arrived since the dramaticexodus during the weekend.   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the nation'spermanent representative in Bonn, Horst Neubauer, complained toSeiters that West Germany was reneging on an agreement by harboringthe newcomers.   West German government urged East Berlin to allow the secondwave of East German refugees to also emigrate to the West. WestGerman officials have said there were no strings attached to theearlier transfer.   Neubauer, according to ADN, told Seiters that it was EastGermany's decision to let the earlier group of refugees leave onhumanitarian grounds because the embassy compounds had becomeunhealthy due to overcrowding.   Neubauer accused West German Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher of falsely taking credit for the resolution of the refugeestandoff.   Despite roadblocks in the area and strict identity checks,between 500 and 600 East Germans have made their way inside thecompound here, refugees reported. About 100 new refugees were atthe embassy in Warsaw.   Czech police patrolled the area with dogs during the night, andsome refugees said police had resorted to violence to stem the flowof East Germans. One woman said police had dragged and kicked herfamily.   A diplomat from the mission hurried out to rescue one man whoclung to the embassy fence as policemen tried to drag him away. Thediplomat put his arm around the East German, and police allowed himto lead the man inside. Police then freed another refugee, who hadbeen handcuffed to a park bench nearby.   East German agreed to the refugee transfer on Saturday andthousands of East Germans from Prague and Warsaw departed onSunday. As they left, however, hundreds of other East Germanstrying to get West convered on the embassies, hoping they too wouldbe granted safe passage to West Germany.   East Germany had harsh words for those who emigrated West duringthe weekend.   ``With their behavior they have trampled on moral values andexcluded themselves from our society. No one should cry any tearsfor them,'' said a government statement issued late Sunday by thestate ADN news agency.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Weare pleased that these refugees are being allowed access to theWest. ... It looks like the officials there are taking aresponsible approach in trying to help these people get to theWest.''   In mid-September, East Germany's Communist leaders registeredfierce protests when Hungary's liberal leaders opened their borderto the West and thousands of East Germans fled.   The exodus through Hungary continued overnight. Borderauthorities in Bavaria reported 1,051 new arrivals by early today.In all, about 2,000 refugees fled through Hungary during theweekend, officials said.   West German government spokesmen disclosed that Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze played an important role in winningthe refugees' release from Prague and Warsaw during the weekend,and said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been in touchwith Bonn by telephone throughout the continuing refugee saga.   Gorbachev is expected in East Berlin to help commemorate 40years of Communist rule in a country that has already lost morethan 100,000 people to the westward exodus this year.   The Soviet Comunist Party daily Pravda today devoted almost allof its fifth page to feting the East German anniversary and saidnot a word about the refugee exodus.   About 7,000 East German refugees, many weeping with joy, pulledinto West German train stations early Sunday after East Berlinagreed to let them emigrate.   Some said they jumped aboard the freedom trains as they passedthrough East Germany, which agreed to the exodus on condition therefugees travel via their homeland. That allowed East Berlin to saythe refugees were being ``expelled.''   The latest arrivals in West Germany follow more than 26,000 EastGermans who have fled through Hungary since Sept. 10, when Budapestbroke ranks with the rest of the East bloc and opened its borderwith Austria.   The extraordinary accord permitting the latest refugees to go tothe West followed discussions involving East and West Germany,Czechoslovakia, Poland, the United States, the Soviet Union andFrance. It underscored dramatic changes in the Soviet bloc andgrowing divisions among its member states.   East Germany, under 77-year-old leader Erich Honecker, has beenan outspoken opponent of the reforms advocated by Gorbachev.   Many of those arriving Sunday aboard packed trains in thenorthern Bavarian city of Hof had tears streaming down their faces.Others cheered and clapped wildly.   ``We had no future there,'' 34-year-old Uwe Kuester of Cottbussaid of his Communist homeland.   Well-wishers handed out bottles of wine, champagne and fruit asthe newcomers disembarked.   West German law automatically grants East Germans citizenship onarrival.</TEXT></DOC>
