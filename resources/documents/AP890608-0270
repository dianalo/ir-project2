Home heating oil futures finished lower, depressed by sluggishdemand typical for this time of year.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 64 cents a gallon,after Wednesday's loss of 1.60 cents.   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $20 per 42-gallon barrel, a gainof 33 cents for the day. The crude contract had dropped 79 centsWednesday.   But the selling continued in the heating oil pits, although notas aggressively as on Wednesday. July-delivery No.2 heating oil fellby 0.05 cent to 48.66 a gallon, adding a minor amount to Wednesday'sloss of 2.29 cents.   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,attributed the buying of gasoline futures to renewed demand,particularly for New York harbor delivery gasoline, at the beginningof the peak summer driving season.   ``As the value of gas moves up, so will crude,'' said Samuels.``Heating oil got left in the dust, which is understandable from aseasonal perspective.''   Crude also got a boost from buying in reaction to the tumbleprices took Wednesday when the outcome of the OPEC meetingdisappointed the markets.   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries ageed to boost the cartel's production ceiling to 19.5million barrels a day in the July-December period.   The new ceiling is 1 million barrels per day higher than thecurrent level but below the estimated daily output in recent weeksof about 21 million barrels.   The OPEC ministers also decided during their Vienna meeting todivide the extra production proportionately among all members.Analysts said this means that some countries will have to curtailsome pumping to keep within their self-imposed quotas.   Kuwait and several other OPEC members have indicated they intendto pump more crude than their quotas allow and energy brokers doubtOPEC will be able to control production enough to maintain strongprices.</TEXT></DOC>
