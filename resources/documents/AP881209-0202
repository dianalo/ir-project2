Sources familiar with the Drexel case, who spoke on conditionthey not be identified, confirmed a report Friday that Terren Pizer,who worked on the bond trading desk at the firm's Beverly Hillsoffice, agreed late Wednesday to provide evidence in exchange forimmunity from prosecution.   Pizer sat near Michael Milken, Drexel's high-yield bond financierand a key target of the federal investigation that has lasted morethan two years, an outgrowth of the Ivan Boesky insider tradingscandal.   Drexel, Milken and two other employees have been accused by theSecurities and Exchange Commission of conspiring with Boesky tocommit frauds that range from trading on inside information to stockmanipulation. Now imprisoned, Boesky has been the government's keysource of evidence in the case.   A Manhattan federal grand jury has been investigating the firm onsimilar grounds and has been expected to indict Drexel, Milken andthe others for months. The defendants have maintained theirinnocence, although Drexel has been negotiating with prosecutorsabout a possible settlement.   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Pizer's cooperationreflected a tougher negotiating stance by the government andintensified pressure on Drexel to capitulate in order to avoid apossibly devastating indictment that would include charges ofracketeering, which carry enormous fines.   But it was unclear what, if any, incriminating material Pizercould provide.   Spokesmen for Drexel and Milken declined to comment on thedevelopment. Aides to Manhattan U.S. attorney Rudolph W. Giulianialso declined to comment in accordance with their policy of silenceon pending investigations.   Pizer's agreement came one day after another key figure in theinvestigation, Milken aide Cary Maultasch, struck a plea bargainwith prosecutors. But the effect of Maultasch's cooperation alsoremains unclear.</TEXT></DOC>
