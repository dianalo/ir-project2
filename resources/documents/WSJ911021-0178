KazumaYamane, a writer, is on a television talk show, but suddenlyhe can't recall a crucial fact he needs to make his point. Sowhen the camera pans elsewhere, the writer whips out hispersonal Encyclopaedia Britannica set, looks up the details,then stashes it away in time to appear conversant with thetopic at hand. He also carries with him his baseballencyclopedia, his comprehensive guide to movies, and hisdictionary, just in case those come in handy.   Actually, Mr. Yamane doesn't really haul around all thosebooks, at least not as books are traditionally known. Hecarries a collection of optical disks, each of which crams upto 100,000 printed pages of information in a 3.5-inch-square,featherweight package. And he &quot;reads&quot; those disks with a1.5-pound Data Discman, a machine that its creator, SonyCorp., hopes will become the Walkman of words.</LP><TEXT>   The Data Discman, introduced in Japan in July 1990, sold100,000 units in its first nine months at a list price of58,000 yen (about $430). Thirty-six disks, from medical-careguides to restaurant guides, are currently available inJapan, and range in price from 2,000 yen to 20,000 yen ($15to $150)   The buyers so far are mainly businessmen in their 40s,particularly professionals who need quick, regular access tosubstantial reference material. &quot;Because of the nature of myjob,&quot; Mr. Yamane says, &quot;I constantly have to travel not onlyin Japan but also overseas.&quot; &quot;It's impossible to carry{reference books} with me all the time, but with the DataDiscman, it's almost like you're carrying a whole bookshelfwith you.&quot; Sales also have been pumped up by Japan'srelatively large population of gadget freaks.   Sony is now trying to whip up interest in the U.S. Itshowed a model at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show inJune, and plans to begin selling Discmans in the U.S. nextmonth. The price will be $549.95 for the machine plus three&quot;books&quot; -- an abridged Encyclopaedia Britannica, a &quot;wellnessencyclopedia,&quot; and a &quot;world travel translator.&quot;   The Discman is only one of what will probably be manyformats for the long-envisaged electronic book. But it isdone in classic Sony form: portable, simple, and cheap,targeting a mass consumer audience. The user flips up the3.4-inch diagonal screen, inserts a disk containing the bookof choice and types on the tiny keyboard the topic ofinterest. In a split second, the screen displays the text.   &quot;People probably won't sit around reading a novel onthem,&quot; says Jeffrey C. Marshall, a market planner for Sony'ssocalled Electronic Publishing Project. &quot;On the other hand,it's a way to find information very quickly.&quot; A referencebook, after all, is nothing more than &quot;a format for storinginformation,&quot; he adds. &quot;Books have search methods built in,such as a table of contents and index.&quot;   But it is an inefficient format. &quot;Books are linear: Onechapter goes after another,&quot; Mr. Marshall says. The DataDiscman allows users to jump directly to the information inthe order they want it.   Sony likes to illustrate with its dictionary. You can plugin either a word, prefix or suffix, up to five key words thatwould appear in a definition, even the number of letters andthe part of speech (for crossword puzzles). When the relevantword and definition pop up, you also get a list of relatedwords. That is comparable to the &quot;see also&quot; directive in aprinted dictionary, but you can gain access to the wordsinstantly, instead of having to flip through a whole volume.   Despite its appeal, however, the Data Discman has yet tocross the line from gimmick to necessity. It will probablyface a battle with other electronic-book formats, and itlacks features that some users will expect from electronicbooks, such as full compatibility with personal computers.   Even Mr. Yamane has some complaints: &quot;The display is toosmall and is sometimes difficult to read, especially whenit's dark,&quot; he says. &quot;The batteries do not last long, and themachine is too thick.&quot; A salesman at Yamagiwa Corp., a largeelectronics retailer, says demand stalled after the initialhype, prompting the outlet to slash prices by one-third.   Sony is already making technical improvements, andpromises more. In August, the company announced two newmodels, which allow transferring data to PCs, increase thescreen size by 70%, improve the graphics, and add sound. (Forexample, you can listen to a John F. Kennedy speech whilereading about the former president.)   And Sony has supreme confidence for the long term. &quot;In thedistant future,&quot; Mr. Marshall says, &quot;it could completelyreplace books.&quot;   ---   Mr. Schlesinger is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Tokyo bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
