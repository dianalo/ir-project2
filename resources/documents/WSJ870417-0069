The company's per-share net rose 27% in the quarter, to 84 cents from 66 cents a year earlier. The difference in the rate of increase was caused by a decrease in preferred-share dividend requirements in the latest quarter.    The tobacco and food concern said it had an after-tax gain in the quarter of $208 million from the sale of its Heublein Inc. wines and spirits division in March. But the gain was offset by after-tax expense provisions of $209 million for equipment and facilities write-downs, for restructuring costs and for early retirement of debt.    Sales rose 2.7% to $3.49 billion from $3.4 billion.    RJR said its first-quarter domestic tobacco sales rose 3.3% to $1.02 billion from $991 million a year earlier. While volume remained flat, prices increased.    International tobacco sales rose 24% in the quarter, to $339 million from $274 million a year earlier. Volume rose in some foreign markets, and the dollar's decline helped.    RJR said its food sales fell slightly, to $2.12 billion from $2.13 billion a year earlier, because the company sold some food operations during the year. Earnings from continuing operations in the food business rose 15% to $156 million from $136 million a year earlier. RJR said its U.S. biscuit, grocery products and Del Monte divisions were particularly strong in the quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
