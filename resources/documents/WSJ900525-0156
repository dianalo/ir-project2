Voters see the Soviet summit yielding evenbetter relations.   Fifty-four percent say the impending meeting cansubstantially improve ties, according to a new Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll. &quot;Gorbachev's popularity is thelinchpin to U.S.-Soviet relations,&quot; say pollsters Peter Hartand Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey for the Journaland NBC. Despite the Soviet leader's Baltic, economic andother woes, some 59% of U.S. voters view him positively, upfrom 51% in December.</LP><TEXT>   But skepticism remains. By 50% to 38%, voters opposehelping strengthen the Soviet economy; in December, suchsupport was favored by 45% to 40%. Voters are closely dividedon whether the Soviets can be trusted to live up toarms-control agreements. If Gorbachev were no longer inpower, voters would distrust the Soviets by three to one, but64% predict he will still be in charge two years from now.   Voters split evenly on whether Soviet recognition ofLithuanian independence should be a condition of any newaccords -- something Bush won't demand, and Gorbachevwouldn't accept.                                                                                                          DUMP QUAYLE? Voters would rather see Baker as Bush's 1992running mate.   Those polled prefer the secretary of state for the ticketover Quayle by nearly two to one; Republicans favor Baker by43% to 35%. &quot;Particularly if the economy is bad, thepresident is going to have to choose someone else,&quot; assertsone GOP strategist.   Only 29% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed betweenFriday and Tuesday hold positive views of Quayle, while 37%view him negatively; despite concerted administration effortsto burnish the vice president's image, those numbers arevirtually identical to soundings taken last November andMarch. Baker's positive-negative ratio is 44%-20%. On theother hand, he still doesn't match Gorbachev's 59%-16%.                                                                                                          VOTER EDGINESS could nudge Bush toward a budget deal withCongress.   While the president's job-approval remains high, at 72%,the percentage who say the country is generally going in theright direction dips to 42%-38%, down from 47%-32% a monthago. Bush's slipping economic approval rating could alsoprovide impetus for an accord.   White House aides insist that a genuine, long-term fixwould be a potent political winner, easily outweighing anyflak he takes if he goes back on his no-new-taxes pledge. Butsome would prefer no deal at all to a modest one that mightmake it appear he gave up too readily on taxes.   A key to selling any deal, aides believe, will beconvincing Americans that it restores &quot;sanity&quot; to the budgetprocess.                                                                                                          RECESSION FEARS return to earlier levels after a briefburst of optimism last month. In the new Journal/NBC poll,30% expect a downturn in the next year. That is up from 23%last month, but equal to the figures for January and March.                                                                                                          REPUBLICANS GAIN in voter intentions for this year's Houseraces. Thirty-four percent say they plan to vote for the GOPcandidate in their district, while 33% say they'll voteDemocratic. Democrats had been consistently leading in thatbarometer since last September.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS SEE a political edge in the pendingparental-leave bill. In the poll, nearly seven in 10 supportsuch a law even if it would mean additional costs tobusinesses. Even some GOP lawmakers like Rep. Martin, runningfor the Senate in Illinois, break with Bush on the issue.                                                                                                          NO NUKES in Europe shouldn't be the U.S. goal, votersbelieve. Seven of 10 agree that the U.S. should alwaysmaintain some nuclear weapons there, while only 22% sayalmost all such weapons should eventually be removed.                                                                                                          HOSTAGE HOLDUP: Hope fades that more releases are coming.   U.S. analysts say Lebanese Shiites rebuff Iran's bids formore releases. Bush's small signals to Iran after Reed andPolhill were freed fail to impress the hostage-holders asexpressions of good will. &quot;They aren't viewing these asreciprocal gestures,&quot; says one U.S. official. &quot;They believedus when we said they weren't linked to hostages.&quot;   Bush remains wary of any stronger steps that might make itappear he is negotiating with the terrorists. Voters in theJournal/NBC poll approve his handling of the hostagesituation by two to one, but they are deeply split overwhether the U.S. should negotiate directly with thehostage-holders; 48% oppose such dealings, while 45% favorthem.   Forty-eight percent favor pressuring Israel to releaseArab prisoners to help gain the release of the U.S. hostages,while 43% oppose such pressure.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Gender Gapski: While 64% of men viewGorbachev positively, only 53% of women do. . . . Traitors totheir class? Fifty-seven percent of voters with incomes over$50,000 would rather see higher taxes on upper-incometaxpayers than an increase in the gasoline tax. . . . TheG-8?
