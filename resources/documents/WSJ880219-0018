Mr. Lynch's office said he was in Tokyo yesterday and couldn't be reached to elaborate on his remarks. An SEC spokeswoman, Mary McCue, said she agrees that &quot;it's a different climate,&quot; in which cooperation has become more elusive. But she said &quot;it would be very wrong&quot; to infer that the lack of cooperation &quot;is impeding any investigation.&quot;    So far, insider-trading cases against Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky and Martin Siegel have been resolved with guilty pleas and cooperation. Both Mr. Levine and Mr. Boesky have been sentenced to prison terms, although the sentencing judges in both cases praised their cooperation and indicated their sentences would have been more severe if they hadn't cooperated. Mr. Siegel awaits sentencing. </TEXT></DOC>
