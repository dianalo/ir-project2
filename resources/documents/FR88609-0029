Background</ITAG>A. GeneralA health maintenance organization (HMO) or a competitive medical plan (CMP)may be described generally as an organization that provides health careservices, on a prepaid basis, to a group of persons who are enrolled asmembers.Section 1876 of the Social Security Act (the Act), as amended by section114 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Pub.L. 97-248, authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with HMOs andCMPs (herein referred to as eligible organizations) under which the organizationsreceive payment from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) inreturn for providing Medicare covered services to Medicare beneficiarieswho enroll in the organizations. Under this section of the Act, two typesof contracts are available to eligible organizations: one that permitspayment on a reasonable cost basis, and one that provides for payment ona risk basis.B. Payments to Eligible Organizations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reasonable Cost Payment</ITAG>Under the reasonable cost payment method, payment is made to the eligibleorganization(s) on an interim basis using a monthly capitation rate. Atthe end of the eligible organization's contract term, payments are adjustedto equal the reasonable cost of the covered services the eligible organizationfurnished to its Medicare enrollees, using as a model the Medicare paymentprinciples that are commonly used to calculate reasonable costs (as definedin section 1861(v) of the Act) for providers of services (also see Medicareregulations at 42 CFR 417.530 through 417.576).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Risk Payment</ITAG>The authority to enter into risk contracts was established to encourageeligible organizations to participate in Medicare in a competitive mannerand to provide incentives to competition in the health care field. In general,risk basis eligible organizations are paid each month, in advance, a predeterminedrate for each Medicare beneficiary enrolled in the organization; the monthlycapitation rate is not subject to adjustment based on actual use of services.The regulations implementing this authority are located at 42 CFR Part417, Subpart C.Section 1876 (a), (e), and (g) of the Act provides a process of prospectivepayment based on the Secretary's annual determination of an adjusted averageper capita cost (AAPCC) for each class of Medicare enrollees in an eligibleorganization. In order to determine the appropriate payment amount, enrolledbeneficiaries are first grouped into classes according to the followingdemographic factors: age, sex, Medicaid status, disability status, institutionalstatus, and other relevant factors that HCFA determines have a significanteffect on the use and costs of health care services. The AAPCC is an actuarialestimate made by HCFA of the average per capita cost that would have beenincurred by the Medicare program on behalf of each class of Medicare enrolleeof the organization if that class of enrollee had received its coveredservices from fee-for-service providers and suppliers in the same or similargeographic area serviced by the eligible organization.In general, eligible organizations receive a monthly per capita paymentin advance for each beneficiary who is registered in HCFA's records asa Medicare enrollee of the organization. The per capita payment equals95 percent of the AAPCC for each class of enrollee.This payment is subject to a reconciliation process to take into accountany differences between the organization's actual number of Medicare enrolleesin each class and the number of individuals estimated to be enrolled ineach class when determining the amount of advanced payment.Prior to each contract period, for purposes of determining whether or nota risk organization must provide its Medicare enrollees with additionalbenefits during the contract period, the following actions take place:(1) HCFA furnishes to each eligible organization a per capita rate of paymentfor each class of Medicare enrollee (andSection; 417.584(b)(2)).(2) Taking into account the information provided by HCFA in: (1) Above,the organization computes and provides to HCFA an estimated monthly percapita average payment rate (APR) based on the organization's anticipatedenrollment distribution among the various classes of enrollees (andSection;417.590).(3) The organization computes and provides to HCFA its adjusted communityrate (ACR), which is then reviewed and approved (or modified, if necessary)by HCFA. The ACR is the equivalent of the premium that the organizationwould have charged Medicare enrollees for a benefit package limited toMedicare covered services independently of Medicare payments to the organization(for example, as if Medicare was not making payments to the organization)using the same financial assumptions the organization uses for its non-Medicareenrollees.If the risk organization's ACR for Medicare covered services is less thanthe organization's APR for these services, the organization must eitheraccept a reduced monthly payment from HCFA or provide its Medicare enrolleeswith additional benefits (in the form of additional services, a reductionin premiums or copayments, or a combination of these). The additional benefitsmust be at least equal in value to the difference between the ACR and theAPR, unless the organization requests a reduction in its monthly paymentfrom HCFA or requests that HCFA withhold a part of the value of the additionalbenefits it would otherwise be required to provide to its Medicare enrolleesand place it in a benefit stabilization fund (BSF). The withholding ofamounts in a BSF is for the purpose of stabilizing fluctuations in theavailability of the additional benefits provided by an organization toits Medicare enrollees. An organization may request a withdrawal from itsfund when the organization notifies HCFA of its ACR and APR for a futurecontract period to prevent excessive fluctuations in the provision of requiredadditional benefits for that contract period. Regulations at andSection;andSection;417.580 through 417.598 implement those portions of the Act pertainingto an organization's BSF and the amount HCFA pays an organization for itsMedicare enrollees who are enrolled on a risk basis.Under section 1876(c)(2)(B) of the Act and andSection; 417.440(b)(2) of theregulations, a Medicare enrollee of an organization may elect to pay foroptional supplemental services that are offered by the organization inaddition to the additional benefits required above. Subject to the approvalof HCFA, a risk organization may also require Medicare enrollees to acceptand pay for mandatory supplemental services that the organization selectsand HCFA approves. (andSection; 417.440(b)(3)).C. Contract and Enrollment RequirementsThe original HMO/CMP legislation also established certain requirementswith respect to contracts and enrollment procedures under section 1876of the Act. These requirements apply to all eligible organizations, thoseunder cost contracts and those under risk contracts. Section 1876(i)(1) of the Act and andSection;andSection; 417.474 and 417.490of the regulations, require that each contract entered into between HCFAand an eligible organization will be for a term of at least 12 months andwill be automatically renewable unless HCFA or the organization decidesnot to renew. During the annual term of the contract, all organizationsincluding cost contractors, must guarantee the provision of all servicesrequired under the contract. Section 1876(c)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and andSection;andSection;417.413(f) and 417.426 of the regulations require that each eligible organizationhave an annual open enrollment period for Medicare beneficiaries of atleast 30 days duration. The statute and regulations also require that aneligible organization must enroll beneficiaries on a first-come, first-servedbasis during open enrollment unless it has received a waiver of the openenrollment requirement. An organization may apply for a waiver of the openenrollment requirement if compliance would prevent adherence to requiredlimitations on enrollment of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries (for example,50 percent of membership), or result in an enrollment substantially nonrepresentativeof the population of the organization's geographic area.An organization may also request permission to limit enrollments becauseof capacity limitations. In determining its enrollment capacity, an organizationmay reserve a reasonable number of vacancies for anticipated new groups(such as employer group health plans contracting with the organization)or new members of existing group contracts. Amended section 1876(c)(3)(B)of the Act and andSection; 417.460(b) of the regulations provide that beneficiariesmay file notice at any time of their intention to terminate their enrollmentin an eligible organization and that the disenrollment will be effectivewith the first of the following month.D. Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA)Section 2350(a)(1) of DEFRA amended the open enrollment provisions undersection 1876(c)(3)(A) of the Act. Section 1876(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Actas amended, requires that for each area served by more than one eligibleorganization, the Secretary must establish (after consultation with theseorganizations) a single 30-day period each year during which all the organizationsserving the area must provide for open enrollment. (Hereafter, this processwill be referred to as coordinated open enrollment.) Eligible organizationsmay, at their option, provide for additional open enrollment periods asthey deem appropriate.Section 1876(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act as amended also requires the Secretaryto determine an organization's rate of payment in a manner that assuresthat beneficiaries enrolling during the coordinated open enrollment periodwill not have their premiums increased or their benefits decreased forthe 12 month enrollment period for which the beneficiary is enrolling.Section 2350(a)(2) of DEFRA authorized the Secretary to phase in coordinatedopen enrollment over a period of 3 years, if the Secretary determined thata single 30-day open enrollment period for all areas was not administrativelyfeasible by the end of the 3-year period.In considering this legislation, Congress expected the Secretary to takenecessary measures to assure that an appropriate portion of an eligibleorganization's enrollment capacity is reserved to accommodate Medicareenrollees during coordinated open enrollment.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Major Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>In order to implement the statutory directive that annual per capita rates(AAPCC) be determined in a manner that assures that the benefit packagenot be decreased and premiums not be increased for at least 12 months forindividuals who enroll during the coordinated open enrollment period, asingle nationwide open enrollment period is necessary. Since payment ratesare effective for 12 months beginning January 1, the effective date ofenrollment for beneficiaries who enroll during the coordinated open enrollmentperiod should also be January 1. However, until now we have been unableto produce the AAPCC figures early enough in a year to allow enough timeto complete the necessary steps for holding a coordinated open enrollmentthat would result in the new enrollments taking effect the following January1. This was because in several data areas, the major one being the finalimpatient hospital prospective payment system (PPS) rates were not readyin time to allow us to calculate the AAPCC before September 7, allowingtoo little time for organizations to consider these rates, submit theirbenefit packages and ACR proposals for HCFA review, conduct a 30-day openenrollment, and process the enrollments by January 1.Section 4002 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87)enacted December 22, 1987 prescribes the update factors in advance forhospitals subject to PPS. As a result, we now have the PPS update factorprior to August 1. This statutory change makes it possible to calculate,and make available, the AAPCC rates by August 1 of each year.This in turn also gives us time to complete the additional steps to implementcoordinated open enrollment.The provisions of the proposed regulations are discussed below.A. EnrollmentIn andSection; 417.204(d), we propose that HMOs contracting under SubpartB (pre-TEFRA contracts) hold their annual open enrollment period duringthe month of November of each year.In andSection; 417.426(a), we propose that all organizations must providea coordinated open enrollment period for Medicare beneficiaries duringthe month of November of each year (as opposed to a nonspecified 30-dayperiod), in addition to any other open enrollment period the organizationmay provide.In andSection; 417.426(b), we propose that an eligible organization approachingits enrollment capacity must obtain a waiver of the open enrollment requirement.The waiver must specify a reasonable number of vacancies to be set asidefor Medicare beneficiaries during the coordinated open enrollment period.The waiver request must be submitted to HCFA at least 90 days before thebeginning of its coordinated open enrollment period. HCFA would evaluatethe organization's submittal and notify the organization as to whetherits proposal was approved or disapproved. If the organization fails tosubmit this information on a timely basis or fails to offer enrollmentto the number of Medicare beneficiaries HCFA approves, HCFA could underthe provisions of andSection; 417.494(b), terminate or not renew the contract.Also, HCFA will refuse to process new enrollments for a plan that has failedto comply with coordinated open enrollment requirements until the followingNovember's coordinated open enrollment.In andSection; 417.450, we propose that the effective month of coverage fora Medicare beneficiary who enrolls in an eligible organization during theorganization's annual November coordinated open enrollment period wouldbe the following January.B. Benefit ProtectionWe would amend andSection; 417.440 by adding paragraph (c) to specify thatfor Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in an organization for allor any part of a calendar year, the organization may not reduce any ofthe additional benefits required by statute or any of the mandatory oroptional supplemental benefits offered by the organization, to which thebeneficiaries are entitled, through December 31 of that year.In a new paragraph (f) in andSection; 417.452, we propose that the organizationmay not increase the beneficiaries liability for any premium or other chargesthat may apply to any benefits offered by the organization under the contractduring the calendar year. We also propose that both andSection; 417.440(c)and andSection; 417.452(f) specify that organizations must notify Medicareenrollees prior to November 1 of benefit or premium changes that will beeffective for the following calendar year.In addition, in a new paragraph andSection; 417.454(b), we propose that anorganization may not increase charges to Medicare beneficiaries who areenrolled in an organization for all or any part of a calendar year, throughDecember 31 of that year.C. Contract Period RequirementsIn andSection; 417.401, we propose to add the definition of ``calendar year''to mean the 12-month period of time beginning January 1 and ending December31.In andSection; 417.474, we propose to add a new paragraph (d) to requirethat all organizations contract on a calendar year basis. For organizationscurrently contracting on other than a calendar year basis (or organizationsseeking an initial contract to begin on any date other than January 1),the term of the first renewal contract (or first contract, for newly contractingorganizations), after the effective date of these regulations, would beginthe day after the date the organization's current contract terminates (orfor new organizations the date the organization selects) and extend throughDecember 31 of the following year, so that subsequent renewals will beon a calendar year basis.In andSection; 417.490, we propose that an organization's contract be renewedautomatically for the next 12-month period beginning the following January1 unless HCFA or the organization decides not to renew, or unless HCFAhas extended the contract under the provisions at andSection; 417.474, sothat the contract term ends on December 31.In andSection; 417.494(a)(3), we would exempt an eligible organization fromthe requirement that it notify its Medicare enrollees of a contract terminationif it terminates its contract on December 31 solely for the purpose ofimmediately beginning a calendar year contract. Likewise, HCFA would notnotify the general public about the contract termination.D. Risk PaymentWe would revise andSection; 417.584(b)(2) to provide that HCFA will makethe payment rates for the following calendar year's contract period availablenot later than August 1 of each year.In andSection; 417.590 (a) and (c), we propose that if the contract periodextends for more than one calendar year (in accordance with andSection; 417.474(d)),the organization must prepare separate ACR and APR computations for eachof the two calendar years in the contract period.In andSection; 417.592(d), we propose that a risk organization notify HCFAnot later than September 15 before the beginning of the contract periodof its ACR and APR calculations for the following year.In andSection; 417.594(f), we propose to add that if a contract extends formore than one calendar year, (under andSection; 417.474(d)), the terms andconditions concerning computation of the ACR specified in andSection; 417.594(a)through (e) apply separately in each of the two calendar years in the contractperiod.In andSection; 417.597, we are clarifying that requests for withdrawals fromthe benefit stabilization fund (BSF) apply to the period covered by theACRs and APRs.E. Other ChangesIn andSection;andSection; 417.401, 417.474(c), 417.592(d)(1), (2), and (e)(2),417.594(b)(5), and 417.596(c)(1), we propose to make minor changes to conformthese sections to the open enrollment and calendar year contract proposals.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Significant Issues Considered in Developing Proposal Regulations</ITAG>A.Benefit ProtectionAs stated earlier, section 1876(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act requires the Secretaryto determine an eligible organization's rate of payment in such a way thatthe Medicare beneficiaries who enroll during a coordinated open enrollmentperiod will not have ``premium charges increased or any additional benefitsdecreased for 12 months beginning on the date the individual's enrollmentbecomes effective.''<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Benefit Protection for Persons Not Enrolling During a CoordinatedOpen Enrollment Period</ITAG>We considered whether the benefit protection established under this sectionof the Act should apply to beneficiaries who enroll in the organizationduring open enrollment periods other than the November coordinated openenrollment period. We determined all beneficiaries who are enrolled inthe organization should be assured that benefits will not be decreasednor charges increased for a definite period of time. However, beneficiarieswho enroll during open enrollment periods other than the November coordinatedopen enrollment period (as well as beneficiaries who are already enrolledin the organization as of January 1 of any year) should be guaranteed thatcharges will not be increased or benefits decreased through December 31of the current year. This policy mirrors our current practice, except thatHCFA will no longer permit organizations to impose premiums previouslywaived by the organization if HCFA must reduce payments under the BalancedBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-177, (alsoknown as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Supplemental Services</ITAG>We considered whether the benefit protection established under this sectionof the Act should apply to the provision of supplemental services authorizedunder section 1876(c)(2) of the Act. Supplemental services are servicesan organization may offer, in addition to certain additional benefits requiredby statute, for which the Medicare enrollee may elect to pay or, subjectto the approval of HCFA, a risk organization may require Medicare enrolleesto accept and pay for. We determined that the benefit protection clauseset forth in the statute does apply to supplemental services because thestatute does not distinguish between additional benefits required by statuteand additional benefits that the beneficiary may elect or be required bythe organization to purchase.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contract Period</ITAG>In meeting the benefit protection and rate determination requirements ofthe statute, we considered permitting the contract periods of risk organizationsand periods of benefit protection for those enrolling during a coordinatedopen enrollment period to differ. We concluded that this would not be feasiblesince it would confuse Medicare beneficiaries, who would be treated differentilyby organizations depending on whether they enrolled during coordinatedopen enrollment or at some other time. Such a proposal would also be difficultfor plans to administer since Medicare enrollees would be entitled to differentbenefits depending on whether they enrolled during coordinated open enrollmentor any other enrollment period. Also, it would put the organization atrisk of being incorrectly paid for services provided to their enrollees.As previously described in this preamble, a process of prospective paymentwas created for risk organizations whereby an organization receives monthlyadvance payments and determinations are made regarding additional benefitsthat must be provided to enrollees during a contract period based on certaincalculations that are related to the organization's per capita rate ofpayment established under section 1876(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Per capitarates must be determined by HCFA on an annual basis (section 1876(g)(2)of the Act). Therefore, if the organization's contract were to expire duringthe period when coordinated open enrollment beneficiaries are protectedfrom premium increases or benefit decreases, the organization would beforced to maintain the same benefit plan for those individuals even thoughthe period of time on which benefit calculations were based had lapsed,and even though new calculations may indicate a need for premium or benefitchanges in the new contract period.We considered avoiding the situation of two sets of enrollees and plansoperating simultaneously by extending the contract and the terms of thecontract (payments and benefits established) for up to an additional 11months with no change in payment rates. However, we concluded that thiswould not be reasonable because the calculations (that is, the prospectivepayment rates and benefit determination process) should be updated at leastonce every 12 months.In view of these problems, we concluded that our proposed rules must requirethat the contract period and the 12 month benefit protection period coincidewith a calendar year. (An exception would be made for organizations intransition to a calendar year contract period, as discussed in SectionD below.) B. National Coordinated Open Enrollment Period Having established the need for the contract period and benefit protectionperiod to be the same, we determined that it would be administrativelymore practical to establish a single month, nationwide, when all organizationswould conduct a single coordinated open enrollment period rather than havingdifferent coordinated open enrollment periods for each geographic area.A single nationwide coordinated enrollment period would prevent hardshipsin several different circumstances. For instance, we believe that as neworganizations proliferate, geographic areas will overlap creating the potentialfor different coordinated open enrollment periods for different sectionsof an organization's geographic area. It would be difficult for organizationsto comply with this arrangement. A national coordinated open enrollmentperiod for all organizations could be advertised more easily than differentenrollment periods for different areas, and should result in additionalconvenience to Medicare beneficiaries planning changes in their healthinsurance. A national coordinated open enrollment period could result inan increase in enrollments as beneficiaries will have the opportunity tocompare, at the same time, the advantages of enrolling in an eligible organizationover remaining in the fee-for-service Medicare system. Also, we have had experience, since the final HMO/CMP regulations werepublished in 1985, with some organizations choosing not to renew theircontracts at the conclusion of their terms. A single national coordinatedopen enrollment period would facilitate the transfer of enrollees fromnon-renewing organizations to other organizations in the area. Withouta single coordinated open enrollment period, organizations could simplyclose enrollment (assuming the required 30-day open enrollment period hadbeen or would be conducted within a 12-month period) to enrollees wishingto transfer from non-renewing organizations. In order to facilitate a calendar year period in which benefits would notbe decreased nor charges increased, we selected the month of November asthe 30-day period during which all eligible organizations must conducta coordinated open enrollment. Applications for enrollment received duringNovember could all be processed in time to make January the month in whicha new enrollee's effective date of coverage would begin. We believe January is the preferred month for several reasons. First, basedon our contract experience to date with eligible organizations, Januaryhas been the month in which the majority of the contract periods have begun.Therefore, of the 12 months in a year, January would appear to be acceptableto the greatest number of risk organizations. Second, the Medicare statuteprovides that the AAPCC will be on a calendar year basis, and a 12-monthcalendar year payment ratebook (a table of per capita rates of paymentfor each class of Medicare enrollee in the organization based on a calendaryear) coincides best with the necessary actuarial calculations we mustmake, both in terms of the availability of data and our workload. Third, we considered exempting organizations in whose geographic area noother eligible organizations compete for enrollees since their inclusionis not required under the statute. However, the statute does not bar usfrom requiring those organizations to participate, and we have determinedthat their inclusion would simplify administration of the national coordinatedopen enrollment period. Fourth, we considered whether coordinated open enrollment should applyto HMOs still contracting on a risk basis under rules in effect prior tothe effective date of TEFRA. Section 114(c)(1)(B) of TEFRA provides thatthe TEFRA amendments to section 1876 of the Act will not apply with respectto services furnished by HMOs which had risk-sharing contracts in effecton the effective date of the TEFRA amendments for the following 5 yearperiod (that is, until February 1, 1990). There are four HMOs contractingon this basis. Section 2350 of DEFRA does not distinguish between pre-TEFRArisk contractors and TEFRA contractors, and we believe that a single coordinatedopen enrollment period applicable to all contractors best serves the interestof the Medicare program. For these reasons, and because section 114(c)(1)(B)of TEFRA does not preclude our amending the regulations affecting enrollmentin pre-TEFRA risk contracts (42 CFR Part 417, Subpart B), we propose toamend andSection;417.204(d) to provide that pre-TEFRA risk contracts holdtheir annual 30-day open enrollment period during the month of November.We have made this change so that all HMOs and CMPs with Medicare contractswill hold an open enrollment period simultaneously in November, to simplifyadministration of the national coordinated open enrollment period for HCFA,and for the convenience of beneficiaries who may wish to enroll. C. Consultation Process Section 1876(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act as amended, requires that the Secretaryconsult with affected organizations concerning the timing of the coordinatedopen enrollment period. Because of the reasons set forth above, we areproposing to establish a single national coordinated open enrollment periodeach November with coverage effective the following January. We will carefullyconsider comments from organizations on the timing of the enrollment period.D. Transition to Coordinated Open EnrollmentWe considered how best to effectuate a smooth transition to coordinatedopen enrollment for risk organizations that are not currently contractingon a calendar year basis (that is, how organizations might make a transitionto a January through December contract period). One option might be forthe organization to enter into a contract with HCFA for a period of lessthan 12 months. For example, if a contract period ends July 31, a new contractcould be established for the period August through December in order thatanother new contract could be established for a period of 12 months beginningJanuary 1 of the following calendar year. However, the statute requireseach contract to be for at least one year. Another option is to ``extend''the contract period already in effect through December 31 of a calendaryear. In this case, if a contract period would normally end July 31, HCFAwould extend the term of the contract to the following December 31 so thata new contract period could be established for a period of 12 months beginningJanuary 1. The extension period would, in this situation, cover that periodAugust 1 through December 31. However, in accordance with the current regulationsat andSection; 417.494(a), an eligible organization would have to agree toextend the term of its contract in order for it to be extended. HCFA couldnot unilaterally require organizations to agree to a contract modification.Universal compliance with the coordinated open enrollment provisions ofthe statute would therefore be jeopardized. A third alternative, the onewe selected, is to require that an organization's next contract renewalterm, (or new organizations' initial contract term, if effective on anydate other than January 1) extend through December 31 of the followingyear.As stated in section II. of this preamble, we are proposing to requirerecalculation of the monthly Medicare payment and additional benefits forthe calendar year following the contract effective date as if that calendaryear was an annual contract period renewal (andSection; 417.590). The alternativeto this approach would be to continue with the same terms through the entireterm of the contract for the first 12 months of the contract. We choseto require that rates be adjusted on January 1 during the contract term,believing that it would be inequitable to risk organizations for paymentarrangements to remain in effect for up to 23 months. Additionally, webelieve it is the intent of the statute that payment rates should be reviewedand updated annually.We believe the transition process we have proposed would not unduly burdeneligible organizations that extend their contracts under andSection; 417.474(d).We would exempt organizations that choose to terminate their contractson December 31 and execute new ones effective January 1 from meeting therequirement of andSection; 417.494(c) concerning notification of terminationto Medicare enrollees, since this notification process is directed towardorganizations that do not intend to re-execute their contracts immediately.However, these organizations would not be exempt from notifying enrolleesof modifications in their contracts as required under andSection; 417.494(a)(2).Notification under this circumstance would occur earlier than usual fororganizations that do not now contract on a calendar year basis. Afterthis one instance, notification would normally be required only when thecontract is renewed annually. Existing contracts are renewed annually inany case, and most new organizations prefer to update their plans on January1 in order to reflect new AAPCC rates and current costs (APR and ACR).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely toresult in: an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we generally prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysisthat is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulationwould not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. For purposes of the RFA, we treat all providers as small entities.Currently, the statute requires eligible organizations to enter into Medicarecontracts for a term of at least 12 months and have an annual open enrollmentperiod of at least 30 days duration. This proposed rule would require eligibleorganizations to hold an annual coordinated open enrollment of all Medicarebeneficiaries during the month of November each year. Further, the proposalwould require all organizations to contract on a calendar year basis.We believe that these changes would have a minimal economic impact in lightof the fact that most eligible organizations have already selected thecalendar year contracting period. Also, the selection of a single openenrollment period would provide a more effective and less confusing processfor all parties concerned.For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. We have, therefore, not prepareda regulatory flexibility analysis.Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis for any proposed rule that may have a significant impacton the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Suchan analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. Forpurposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospitalas a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statisticalarea. We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposedregulation would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantialnumber of small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Required Information</ITAG>A. Response to CommentsBecause of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receiveon a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually.However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date andtime specified in the ``Date'' section of this preamble, and, if we proceedwith a final rule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble of thatrule.B. Paperwork Reduction ActSections 417.426(b)(1) and (4), 417.474(c), 417.494(a)(3), 417.592(d),417.594(b)(5), 417.596, 417.597, and 417.598, of this rule contain informationcollection requirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504), we have submitted a copy of thisdocument to the Executive Office of Management and Budget (EOMB) for itsreview of these information collection requirements.The requirements contained in the above-mentioned sections were approvedby EOMB, and the EOMB approval number is 0938-0406. However, the approvalexpired in April 1988. Therefore, we have required an extension of thatapproval.In addition, andSection;417.426(b) of this proposed rule contains informationcollection requirements that have not been approved by EOMB. Organizationsand individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collectionrequirements should direct them to the agency official whose name appearsin the ``ADDRESS'' section of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 417</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Health maintenance organizations(HMO), Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 42 CFR Part 417, would be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 417_HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, COMPETITIVE MEDICAL PLANS,AND HEALTH CARE PREPAYMENT PLANS</ITAG>1.
