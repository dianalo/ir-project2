About 50,000 people gathered in the city's Peace Memorial Parkto mark the anniversary of the city's destruction by a U.S. atomicbomb. Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said the memorial should ``soundan alarm'' for the future, and he said Japan should carry out moreaggressive diplomacy to work for peace.   At 8:15 a.m., the precise time when the bomb exploded in a flashof white light on Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima residents, Japanesegovernment officials and foreign guests bowed their heads in silentprayer while this city of 1 million came to a halt. A single bellrang, and 1,000 doves were released.   People on stopped buses and streetcars, and patients in theirhospital beds, prayed.   At the same time, 1,000 people staged what they called a``die-in'' in front of the Peace Park's A-Bomb Dome, a preservedruin from the atomic attack. The group of Japanese and foreignanti-nuclear activists protested nuclear arms and appealed forpeace, a representative said.   About 140,000 people died in the blast, firestorm and radiationfrom the attack on this western Japanese city, a major militarycenter during World War II.   ``Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomicattack, is determined that the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasakishould never be repeated,'' Uno told the crowd in the park. Manywere dressed in black mourning clothes, despite sweltering heat.   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States droppeda second atom bomb on the coastal city of Nagasaki, killing 70,000people. Japan surrendered unconditionally Aug. 15, 1945, ending thewar.   ``We strongly feel the duty to use Hiroshima to sound an alarmbell for the future of all humanity,'' Uno said. ``From now on,Japan must carry out more aggressive diplomacy for peace andsecurity in the world,'' said Uno.   He is about to step down as prime minister after a severeelection setback for his party.   A group of mayors at an international peace conference,including Anne Rudin of Sacramento, Calif., and Herbert Schmalstiegof Hanover, West Germany, placed a wreath of yellow chrysanthemumsbeside a granite tomb dedicated to the bomb victims. Chrysanthemumsare a traditional mourning flower.   ``The people of Hiroshima have turned this into a positive thingbecause they have educated the world about the horror of nuclearwar,'' Ms. Rudin said after the ceremony.   Outside, hundreds of Boy Scouts handed visitors fresh flowerswhile protesters passed out leaflets accusing the government oflaxity in enforcing a policy against allowing U.S. and otherwarships to bring nuclear weapons into Japan.   Korean residents of Japan distributed pamphlets demanding thatthe government apologize for Japan's aggression against otherAsians in World War II and other conflicts.   In his annual peace declaration, Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Arakisaid ``the Cold War framework of East-West relations'' was beingreplaced by ``a new order of international peace.''   Araki, a survivor of the atomic attack and an anti-nuclearactivist, called on Japan to reduce its military spending andpointed to progress in superpower arms control.   In the Philippine capital of Manila, a left-wing group markedthe anniversary by calling for the end to nuclear weapons andestablishment of international nuclear-free zones.   The group, the Society of Ex-Detainees for Liberation AgainstDetention and for Amnesty, is made up of former political prisonersunder the government of Ferdinand Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
