In the magnetic calculation,orbital moment effects are included self-consistently. Comparison ofspecific-heat data to the band density of states of the paramagneticphase indicates a mass renormalization factor of 4.6, similar to whatis seen in mixed-valence CeSn{sub 3}. The moment-polarized calculationyields a total moment of 4.1{mu}/sub B/, and an 86% gapping of the Fermisurface through the magnetic phase transition. The moment value is notconsistent with the observed low-field-phase value of 1.7{mu}/sub B/,but is consistent with the one in the higher-field metamagnetic phase.We also show evidence that the prediction of incomplete gapping of theFermi surface is not inconsistent with specific-heat and resistivitydata. Finally, we find that the insulating gap seen in TmTe can onlybe reproduced in a calculation where the f electrons are treated as corestates.</TEXT></DOC>
