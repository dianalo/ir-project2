The budget in the fiscal year 1986 was 27.2million dollars. USA established 4 laws for the development of geothermalenergy and clearly showed the plan of the energy policy. The recent policyof DOE is the promotion of the government and people cooperation, theacceleration of technology transfer and the increase of technology export.The main themes are the research on hot water reservoirs, geopressuredbrine resources, hot dry rock reservoirs, magma energy and others, theresearch on hard rock digging and the research on the technology of energyconversion for these geothermal resources. In the text, the objectiveand method of 14 researches are outlined.(6 refs, 9 figs, 5 tabs, 5 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
