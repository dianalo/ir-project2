Importations of textiles covered under a counterfeitvisa from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are contrary to the textileagreement between the PRC and the U.S. entered into in accordance with7 U.S.C. 1854. A serious situation has developed with regard to the importation of textileproducts from the PRC. In 1987, Customs detected almost 200 counterfeitvisas (textile export license(s)/commercial invoice(s). Seizures of nearly$20 million in merchandise resulted. The considerable amount of fraudulent activity involving the importationof PRC merchandise has created an enforcement and administrative burdenon Customs. Customs anticipates that when the calendar year quotas reopenin January 1988, the ensuing volume of Chinese imports will include a significantnumber accompanied by counterfeit visas. Customs wishes to alert the importing public of this problem. Because merchandisecovered by a counterfeit visa is subject to seizure, the importing publicshould be aware of how to recognize a counterfeit visa. Accordingly, Customsis setting forth in this document the characteristics of genuine and counterfeitPRC visas. <ITAG tagnum="84">Detection of Counterfeit Visas </ITAG>The genuine visa is printed in two colors. There is background in eitherblue or green of wavy <T3>continuous </T3>lines. Over this, there is imprinted in black, an assortmentof letters, lines, and Chinese characters. Finally, the serial number isstamped in its appropriate box. The calendar-year prefix is typed in later.Counterfeit visas are frequently distinguished by the following characteristics:<ITAG tagnum="84">Detail Loss </ITAG>In photo-offsetting, some detail loss is inevitable. This phenomenon resultsin lost apostrophes, lost dots on ``i's'', and other details in the blackprinted portion of the visa. In addition, it results in breaks in the continuous``brush strokes'' in the delicate Chinese characters. This loss of detailalso affects the colored background when it is photo-offset. In some ofthe poorer counterfeits, this loss of detail causes the entire patternto ``look different.''<T3>Specific Problem Areas: </T3>(One or more areas can be present)<ITAG tagnum="16">_Background is very faint and color is uneven. Color and detail arebest at bottom but washed out in the center of the document.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_There are light spots in the background pattern in several places,most notably in block nos. 10 and 12.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Block 14 ``issuing authorities' stamp and signature'' is missingthe plural possessive apostrophe and ``i's'' are </ITAG><T3>not </T3>dotted.<ITAG tagnum="16">_In block 14, there is a dot immediately preceding the ``I'' in `Issuing'',slightly above the center of the ``I''. This dot is a consistent idiosyncrasyfor authentic GREEN PRC visas. However, it has not been observed on anylegitimate BLUE visas or specimens. We believe that this counterfeiterhas photo offset the black detail from a green visa and is using the plateto fabricate blue visas.</ITAG>If a specimen or known authentic vias is available, the following indicatorscan be used:<ITAG tagnum="16">_Background color too gray.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Background color too gray and has a flatter appearance than the backgroundof an authentic visa.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Length of colored background is approximately \1/8\-inch shorterthan specimen.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Relationship Between Colored Background Line and Blank ``Boxes''</ITAG>The authentic documents exhibit a precise relationship between the wavybackground lines and the overprinted black lines. <T3>Some</T3> of the counterfeits can be discerned due to changes in theserelationships, i.e., background lines ascending instead of descending,as they cross certain black lines. This has apparently been caused by twofactors:1. Some of the counterfeiters have cut-up pieces of background, then photo-offsetit, thereby rearranging the relationships.2. At least one counterfeiter has obtained his own background plate whichis not identical to the authentic plate.<T3>Specific Problem Areas: </T3>(One or more areas can be present)<ITAG tagnum="16">_While viewing the vertical line between blocks 13 and 14, the wavylines ascend from left to right as they cross the black line. In the authenticspecimen and genuine visas examined to date these background lines descendfrom left to right as they cross the vertical black line.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_The background pattern should peak at the point where the line dividingblock 13 and 14 meets the horizontal line above the boxes; instead, itdips.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discontinuances in the Background Pattern</ITAG>Because some counterfeiters have reassembled background plates from ``pieces''of background, some counterfeits have horizontal lines in their backgroundsand/or sudden changes in pattern.<T3>Specific Problem Areas: </T3>(One or more areas can be present)<ITAG tagnum="16">_Background color uneven.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Background pattern is discontinuous with horizontal lines 2\3/8\inches from bottom of pattern (in box 13), 4\5/8\ inches from bottom ofpattern (in box 9) and 8\1/2\ inches from bottom of pattern (in box 6).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_In block 9, \3/4\ inches from the left border of the background and4 \1/2\ inches from the bottom border of the background, there is an oval``o'' in the background contained within a small area of interrupted backgroundlines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Background has horizontal breaks in the pattern 3 \1/8\ inches fromthe bottom of background area and 7 \7/16\ inches from bottom of backgroundarea.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_There are pattern breaks 2 \3/4\ inches from the bottom of the backgroundarea and 7 inches from the bottom of the background area. However, thesepattern breaks are very difficult to discern due to the poor detail ofthe pattern.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_The only readily apparent flaw in the background pattern is a smallcircle in the upper right-hand corner of block 1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Serial Numbers</ITAG>The genuine visas have serial numbers pressed into the paper and this canbe detected by lightly touching the back of the form. So far, most counterfeitsexamined by Customs have <T3>not </T3>had serial numbers pressed in to the document.<T3>Specific Problem Areas: </T3>(One of more areas can be present)<ITAG tagnum="16">_Serial numbers not impressed as in legitimate visas-cannot be feltwith fingertips from back of visa.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Serial numbers are not stylized as in specimen_tops of 7's and 5'sand bottoms of 2's are straight rather than curved as in legitimate visas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Serial numbers are not impressed and cannot be felt from back ofvisa; however, numrals are in similar style to specimen.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_The first few numerals of the serial number can be felt very faintlyfrom the back of the visa.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Commissioner of Customs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael H.
