The military's proposed $299.5 billion budget for fiscal 1989, which begins in October, meets the requirements of the deficit-cutting accord President Reagan reached with the Congress last fall. That new budget blueprint set in motion an across-the-board shrinking of the ambitious defense program set out by former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in President Reagan's first term. But according to Pentagon budget specialists, the latest proposed cuts still fall as much as $150 billion short of Mr. Carlucci's long-term spending targets.    The fiscal 1989 budget, which is to be presented Thursday, is $33 billion lower than what was planned a year ago. To meet the cuts, all the services agreed to reduce their forces by cutting personnel and mothballing aging military hardware. The cuts were distributed fairly equally among the services, although eleventh-hour concessions by Mr. Carlucci eased some of the reductions for the Army. Following are highlights of what the services plan to do without, and what they'll continue to push for, in the coming budget.    The Army plans to cut about 8,600 troops in fiscal 1989, somewhat less than the 10,000-troop reduction Mr. Carlucci's office first demanded. Specifically, the Army will propose cutting two light-infantry battalions in Alaska and a brigade in Fort Lewis, Wash. In addition, administration officials said the Army would retire 450 OH-58 scout helicopters and 170 UH-1 transport helicopters.    Of new Army weapons projects being dropped, the largest is the $60 billion LHX helicopter program, which consisted of two versions of a new aircraft. One version was to have been for attack missions and one for troop and equipment transport. The Army, though, plans to revive a smaller, cheaper model of the attack version.    Administration officials said the Army also is dropping the Lockheed Corp. Aquila, an unmanned reconnaissance plane; the United Technologies Corp. EH-60 communications helicopter, and the Martin Marietta Co. Copperhead missile. Altogether, the Army's cuts add up to $9 billion.    The Navy is likely to bear a greater portion of cuts than it has in the past two years. As part of an $11.6 billion reduction from its original 1989 budget plan, it will propose mothballing 16 frigates constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, thereby postponing the administration's goal of having a 600-ship Navy beginning in fiscal 1989. The Navy also is proposing to drop the Grumman Corp. A-6F attack plane and to dry-dock two of its submarines.    The Navy hopes to keep its number of sailors constant, but the Marine Corps proposes to cut back by 3,000 troops.    The Air Force, which will propose shrinking its originally planned 1989 budget about $10.5 billion, wants to reduce the number of its tactical fighter wings to 35 from 38, and to cut military personnel by 25,000. A wing consists of 72 aircraft.    Purchases of General Dynamics Corp. F-16s and McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15s would be pared significantly under the Air Force proposal. The $50 billion Midgetman missile, which the Pentagon slated for termination late last year, likely will be kept afloat with $200 million in &quot;life support funds&quot; under a compromise hammered out with congressional backers of the mobile nuclear missile.    Pentagon officials acknowledged that the cuts for fiscal 1989 would go only part of the way toward squeezing out $256 billion from the military's spending plans over four years as Mr. Carlucci ordered. The defense secretary ordered the cuts late last year after becoming convinced that at best, Congress would only authorize annual budget increases of 2% after inflation, not the bigger increases envisioned by Mr. Weinberger.    The difficulty in meeting these deeper budget-cutting targets stems from the spate of costly new military programs that are moving ahead. For example, the Air Force is proceeding with the Northrop Corp. Stealth bomber, which will cost $277 million a plane. Both the Air Force and the Navy are moving ahead with new attack aircraft and fighter jets. The Air Force is proceeding with a new cargo plane, the McDonnell Douglas C-17, and the Navy is planning a new class of attack submarines, costing more than $1 billion apiece. </TEXT></DOC>
