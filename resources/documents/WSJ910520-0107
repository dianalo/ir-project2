Saudi Arabia and Egypt will make major purchases ofadvanced U.S. or U.S.-designed weaponry. Israel will giveserious attention to its missile defenses, among otherthings. Turkey will get more Western support for aweapons-modernization program that was under way before thewar.</LP><TEXT>   Soviet weapons salesmen will blame the Iraqis, not Sovietarms, for Saddam's loss and try extra hard to keep Syria andIran as buyers. Iraq will try to rearm, so don't be surprisedif Saddam and his suppliers figure out ways to sneak weaponspast the U.N. embargo.   The economic forces impelling the arms trade are as strongas ever. The Soviets have an enormous arms-productioncapacity and a desperate need for hard currency. They willoffer their traditional customers more-advanced weapons,guaranteed to be more of a match for Western arms. Westernnations have a different problem. Most have cut procurementof major weapons systems for their own forces because of aperception that the Cold War is over, but they would like tokeep production lines running at an economic rate. They toohave a strong incentive to sell arms abroad to hold down unitcosts and get more out of their limited procurement budgets.   If this isn't enough to dismay arms-trade critics, thereis also the mounting evidence that the Gulf War has hardlysettled everything in the region, in part because of the U.S.decision to conduct a hasty withdrawal after expelling Saddamfrom Kuwait. Syria, which has an army almost as large asSaddam's and a president cut from the same cloth, will wantto swing more weight in the region. That Hafez Assad issmarter than Saddam may or may not be reassuring, dependingon how you look at it.   New efforts to control North-South transfers of militarytechnology -- for making chemical weapons, for example --face knotty problems as well. Whereas advanced countriescould usually agree on limiting technology exports to IronCurtain nations during the Cold War, now the issue is morediffused, involving special relationships between advancedcountries and Third World clients.   The International Monetary Fund is preparing a studyshowing that the Gulf states could save $30 billion a year iftheir spending on arms was no more than the internationalaverage, instead of about double as now. But the IMF isreluctant to try to apply any muscle to debtor nationsbecause North-South arms sales and bilateral aid often gohand in hand and the IMF doesn't want to disturb the latter.   All of this will sound pretty hopeless to anyone whobelieves in arms &quot;control.&quot; But approaching these matters onbalance-of-power terms is more realistic, and lessdepressing. Because of the U.N. embargo and the financialstraits of Syria, Iraq and Jordan, the arms buildup in theGulf may not soon return to its prewar pace. Most of theimmediate buildup will be by countries friendly toward theWest, or at least nominally so. Turkey and Israel now arerelatively stronger. Nominally friendly Saudi Arabia andEgypt will be as well. Syria and Jordan are wild cards but atleast will have noticed that the U.S. has awesome militarycapabilities. Iran is cautiously inching toward a betterfooting with the West.   The longer-term scenario is more problematic. Somenow-friendly countries could be subverted. The Soviets remainunpredictable. But there is at least a &quot;new order&quot; of sortsin the Gulf region, even if it falls far short of the highesthopes.</TEXT></DOC>
