PAUL, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Striking miners and Virginia's largest coalcompany agreed to federal mediation after 140 people were arrestedTuesday and four were injured in a rock-throwing confrontationsbetween miners and coal drivers.   The incidents came on the 28th day of the United Mine Workersstrike and were centered around Pittston Coal Group's Moss No. 3coal preparation plant in this southwest Virginia community.Demonstators effectively blockaded the plant.   ``They aren't running enough coal out of here to fire somebody'shouse,'' said strike coordinator Marty Hudson.   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles announced that the union and the companyhad agreed to federal mediation of the dispute. UMW PresidentRichard Trumka suggested a seven-day cooling off period in whichPittston would shut down operations and the union would suspendprotests.   Pittston President Michael Odom said the company ``fullysupported Governor Baliles' request for federal mediation.''   ``We are ready to begin mediation under the auspices of thefederal Mediation and Conciliation Service and we will make everyeffort in that process to resolve the dispute,'' Odom said. He alsocalled on Trumka to end the strike violence.   ``It is the continued violence which is distasteful, dangerousand ultimately destructive of the mediation process,'' Odom said.   The injuries came during a rock-throwing confrontation along aroad leading to the plant where coal from nearby mines is cleaned,sorted and loaded into railroad cars.   According to miner Larry Stanley, about 20 miners were standingin the rain watching coal trucks drive around a tree downed in theroad when the driver of a four-wheel-drive escort vehicle rammedinto the crowd.   ``He done his best to run over all he could,'' said Stanley.``He punched it.''   But State Police spokesman Charles Vaughn said troopers told himthe injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by thecoal truck as the driver attempted to flee ``a hailstorm of rocksthrown by miners.''   Two miners were taken to the Russell County Medical Center innearby Lebanon, said nursing supervisor Debbie Hall. One wastreated and released and the other was admitted for treatment ofbruises.   Odom said a passenger in the escort vehicle suffered a brokenjaw while the driver of one of the trucks, owned by the Jamb MiningCo., suffered serious cuts to the head. Both were being treated atlocal hospitals.   The 140 people arrested, some of them miners' wives, sat infront of the Moss No.3 plant's entrances to block coal trucks thatwere coming and going. They were charged with trespassing, said Lt.C.F. Eaton of the State Police.   After four busloads of arrested demonstrators were driven away,others hit the road in their own cars to make the 15-mile drivebetween Moss No. 3 and Pittston's Lambert Fork mine in an attemptto slow coal trucks traveling between the two operations, Hudsonsaid.   Hudson estimated about 24 trucks carried coal into the plant,which did not appear to be operating. About 570 trucks usually makethe trip each day, he said.   About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virginia are on strike.Miners worked at Pittston for 14 months without a contract beforecalling the strike April 5.   Strike leaders say Pittston, the nation's 15th largest coalcompany and second biggest coal exporter, has refused to take partin contract negotiations and violated labor laws. Both sides agreethat wages are not a major part of the dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
