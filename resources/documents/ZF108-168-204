 The TeamComputing program, HP says, enables workgroup members to communicate acrossnetworks connecting computers from a variety of vendors.andP;  In addition, bothmodels are object-code compatible with the current series 300 product line,enabling users to run 1,800 UNIX-based applications already available.andP;  Thesystems are equipped with a range of graphics capabilities, including 3-Dsolids rendering.andM;Primary applications for the model 345 system, which processes at 12 millioninstructions per second, include design automation, software development andcomputer-aided publishing.andP;  The machine features five application-specificintegrated circuits (ASICs).andP;  Using these chips reduces the number ofinternal parts in the system as well as the amount of heat produced, therebyreducing the chance of electronic failures, HP says.andP;  The 345 comes standardwith 4 megabytes (expandable to 16MB) of error checking and correcting (ECC)random access memory, which prevents system crashes, as well as 32 kilobytesof on-board cache memory and a 64-bit memory bus.andM;Among the standard interfaces available are HP-HIL (HP's input interface),RS-232, Centronics and IEEE 802.3/Ethernet LAN.andP;  The UNIX operating system ispreloaded on the workstation to decrease installation time, the company says.andO;Prices for the model 345 range from $8,995 to $23,995.andM;The new model 375 provides the same 12MIPS performance and similar multipleASIC design as the 345, but has more available memory, making it suitable formore compute-intensive applications such as image processing and laboratoryand medical computation.andP;  The 375 is equipped with 8MB of ECC RAM, which canbe expanded to 32MB.andP;  Eventually, when 4Mb dynamic random access memory(DRAM) chips are available later this year, the model 375 memory will beexpandable to 128MB.andP;  Users can customize their systems with 12 input/outputslots for adding peripherals.andP;  Pricing ranges between $21,995 and $39,995.andM;Current series 300 customers may upgrade to the 345 and 375 models byswapping boards.andP;
