Areddy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN BNK </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many yields on certificates of deposit, reflecting previous increases in major interest rates, jumped more than a tenth of a point this week.    Robert K. Heady, publisher of North Palm Beach, Fla.'s interest rate-news letter, Bank Rate Monitor, said this week's rise, the strongest since last October, was half of the entire previous month's increase.    The move &quot;confirms our expectations. It didn't take more than a week,&quot; said Norberto Mehl, publisher of Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service.    Last week, the Federal Reserve increased the nation's discount rate a halfpoint, to 6.5%, leading banks to increase their prime lending rates.    Banks didn't immediately respond last week to the increases in their lending rates with increases in their savings rates. Analysts termed the lag &quot;playing the spread.&quot;    Mr. Mehl added that major New York banks have been very aggressive since last week, increasing some yields by a halfpoint. The increases put the New York yields above those set at the largest Texas banks, which usually offer some of the highest yields in the country.    The heated competition in New York, Mr. Mehl said, will be reflected in rate rises throughout the nation. The big banks aren't &quot;taking a chance; they know they are covered&quot; by expected rate rises for loans, he added.    Banxquote Online said the average yield for 30-day retail certificates of deposit rose to 6.37% yesterday from 6.24% the week before. Retail, or individual savings CDs, are generally regarded as those with denominations of less than $50,000. At $50,000 and above, the instruments are called jumbo CDs.    The average six-month CD rose to 7.34% yesterday from 7.20% the week before. The average one-year CD yield, meantime, was up 17 basis points, or 17/100ths of a point, to 7.71%. Longer term, the 2 1/2-year CD was up to 7.85% from 7.72%, while five-year CD yields rose 11 basis points, to 8.37%.    Also, yields on many jumbo CDs rose an average of 15 to 25 basis points, according to Banxquote, signaling that institutional investors, the major buyers of jumbo certificates, are demanding still higher yields. In addition, because jumbo yields move slightly ahead of the retail CDs, a reciprocal increase in retail CDs is likely, according to Banxquote.    Bank Rate Monitor said its yield increases-to-decreases ratio jumped to 30.5 to 1, from 9.92 to 1 last week. The newsletter also reported that fixed-rate mortgages, an indicator of long-term lending rates, rose 22 basis points, to 10.79%, this week.    The average yield for money-market accounts was up seven basis points at 5.96%, according to Banxquote. Bank Rate Monitor found a four-basis-point rise to 5.87%.    These bank accounts compete with money market mutual funds, whose average compounded yield over the seven days rose sharply to 7.39% in the week ended Tuesday from 7.22% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for these money funds rose to 7.24% from 7.14%, and the average maturity of funds remained the same at 34 days. </TEXT></DOC>
