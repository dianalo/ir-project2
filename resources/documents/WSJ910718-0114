At around $300 per ton,the cost has proven to be well in excess of the $65 per tonfigure that was originally estimated. True, the program hasbeen plagued by labor problems and a low level of citizenparticipation, but it is wishful thinking to believe thateither more cooperation from sanitation unions or theachievement of greater civic support and a higher recyclingrate will bring the costs of recycling down to an acceptablelevel.   Curbside recycling programs across the U.S. typically costfar more than landfilling, frequently twice as much, evenwhen sales revenues and avoided waste disposal costs areincluded in the calculation. On a strictly economic basis,large-scale recycling is simply wasteful, leaving taxpayersand users of solid waste disposal services paying a largerbill. The frenzied national push for recycling is largely theresult of grossly mistaken beliefs about landfilling and themagnitude of the disposal problem, together with a seriouslyflawed decision-making process in the siting of landfills.</LP><TEXT>   What most people don't know about landfills could fill alandfill. At the current rate, if all the nation's solidwaste for the next 500 years were piled or buried in a singlelandfill to a depth of 100 yards -- about half the eventualheight of Staten Island's Fresh Kills landfill -- this&quot;national landfill&quot; would require a square site less than 20miles on a side. With compaction, even this volume could behalved.   Most people also don't know that the amount of solid wastegenerated nationally has grown at only a 2% average rate overthe past 30 years, considerably less than the growth of GNP.This means that our &quot;throw away society&quot; is actually throwingout a progressively smaller share of its output. There areindications that this rate of growth is declining as theeconomy becomes more service-oriented.   The view is widely held that landfilling should beminimized because of the great environmental risks. Butlandfills are constantly becoming less obnoxious. New federaland state performance standards are comprehensive andstringent, with environmental considerations entering intoall relevant aspects of landfill construction and operation,including location; fencing; groundwater and gas monitoringand control; frequency of earth covering for rodent, bird,and odor control; closure; and post-closure gas andgroundwater monitoring. Many landfills designed and operatedwith this degree of environmental control already exist; somehave already filled and closed, and the land has beenconverted to other (often recreational) uses.   If our landfills are to be environmental Cadillacs, theissue then becomes one of sticker price. As might beexpected, this will vary according to differences in landprices. A new landfill can cost up to five times as much as astandard 1975 landfill. Even so, landfill costs account foronly about 25 cents of the cost of disposing of the garbagein a standard 32-gallon can.   The remainder of what one pays is the relatively high costof collection, hauling and perhaps hidden and explicit taxes.Even where land is expensive it is seldom more than a smallfraction of the landfilling portion of waste disposalcharges. Even with the sky-high land prices and the longhauls that are necessary in most metropolitan areas,landfilling is a bargain.   The solid waste problem is not one of space, ecology oreven cost. The problem is a political one -- that of sitingnew landfills. Anticipating the loss of amenities or propertyvalues, potentially affected property owners unite into agroup capable of bending government to its will. The specialinterest nature of the resulting policies is not different innature from farm subsidies, protective tariffs andunnecessary military installations, all of which conferlosses upon citizens at large.   The landfill siting problem is directly related topopulation densities. In some of the more sparsely populatedareas of the Western states there are virtually no sitingdifficulties. By contrast, in the East, permitting newlandfills is political suicide.   Fortunately, a decision-making procedure is available thathelps the creation of new landfills, while still preservingcontrol over the environmental consequences of landfills. Thestate of Wisconsin has since 1982 legally required municipaland county governments to establish local negotiatingcommittees in response to applications for the creation of alandfill by a private landowner. The committees, which mustinclude a prescribed number of private citizens as well aselected officials, are empowered to negotiate the financialand other contractual relations between the landfill ownerand local governments. Environmental and technical mattersare not negotiable but are handled by a separate process atthe state level. Although -- or perhaps because -- failure toreach an agreement can result in outside mediation andpossibly arbitration by a state agency, agreements have beennegotiated by committee in almost all cases.   The workability of a system along these lines results fromthe explicit recognition of a prescribed set of rules.Although such rules constrain their powers, local electedofficials do not complain, since their longevity in officecan only be enhanced by the inability to make &quot;unpopular&quot;decisions.   The choking off of a viable alternative like low cost andenvironmentally sound landfills is wasteful of society'sresources. Before continuing to run headlong towardpolitically popular but costlier alternatives -- includingrecycling -- it would be wise to give increased attention tothe real cause of the so-called solid waste &quot;crisis.&quot;   ---   Mr. Wiseman, a professor of economics at GonzagaUniversity in Spokane, Wash. is a visiting fellow atResources for the Future, in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
