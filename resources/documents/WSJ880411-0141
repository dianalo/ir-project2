Their objective is to prop up the languishing world oil market, where prices have fallen as much as $4 a barrel this year.    It wouldn't be the first time the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries attempted to gain non-OPEC cooperation for cuts, but this effort, announced Saturday, appears to have a better chance to succeed than in the past because the initiative came from eight non-OPEC countries.    The decision to seek an alliance with oil producers outside the cartel was reached late Saturday in a meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee. The five ministers of the committee plan to reconvene on April 23 and invite officials of as many as 10 non-OPEC producing countries, possibly including Norway and the Soviet Union, to meet with them.    The joint meeting will be followed on April 25 by a &quot;consultative&quot; meeting of all 13 OPEC ministers which, in turn, could become a full emergency conference to take official action on any production changes.    OPEC hadn't been expected to hold a full ministerial conference until its regular midyear meeting beginning June 8. But Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the president of OPEC, said that &quot;a consultative meeting is indicated to ensure that the market will stabilize at higher prices.&quot;    OPEC, which has problems enough keeping a lid on its own production, hasn't had much success in previous attempts to encourage nonmembers to rein in their output. The new effort could fizzle quickly.    But the latest initiative toward such cooperation came from eight non-OPEC countries: Mexico, China, Oman, Angola, Colombia, Egypt, Brunei and Malaysia held a series of London meetings last month to discuss similar strategies. With OPEC also committed, producers of more than one-half the non-Communist world's oil supply, 49 million barrels a day, could be represented at the April meetings. OPEC alone produces between 17 million and 18 million barrels a day.    OPEC long has blamed non-OPEC producers for the world oil glut. But &quot;there have never been better conditions for cooperation&quot; between the groups, Belkacem Nabi, the oil minister of Algeria, said yesterday. &quot;OPEC should not see itself as a closed house,&quot; he added.    Being considered are production cuts of 300,000 barrels a day by the non-OPEC group and 600,000 barrels a day by OPEC -- 4% of the total output of all the exporters tentatively involved.    But these are only proposed cuts. &quot;The negotiations are going to be very difficult,&quot; said an official of one non-OPEC producer.    The price-monitoring committee of OPEC is comprised of the oil ministers of Nigeria, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Only two, Mr. Nabi of Algeria and Arturo Hernandez Grisanti of Venezuela, have been strong supporters of further cuts in OPEC's production quotas this year because of sliding oil prices. The others have been reluctant even to hold a meeting of the committee, which is charged by OPEC to monitor world oil prices.    Because of the split, the committee had been expected to meet quickly and go home without taking any official action other than a new plea for all OPEC members to adhere to production quotas.    But the chain of events leading to a possible alliance of OPEC and non-OPEC producers has been bizarre, even by OPEC standards. Kings and presidents are said to have played a role. So did Iran, which is at war with with another OPEC member, Iraq.    Until late Saturday, it seemed clear the ministers would recommend neither a production cut nor a full ministerial conference. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, has maintained that further cuts in OPEC output would mean loss of market share to non-OPEC producers. Indonesia and Nigeria also were believed to oppose more reductions in OPEC quotas.    During a lunch break Saturday, the ministers appeared to have a consensus that little should be done at this time. Indeed, a draft communique to that effect was already being prepared.    But H. Kazempour Ardebili, Iran's deputy oil minister, arrived uninvited Saturday afternoon while the ministers were lunching, took a room just down the hall of the hotel where the ministers were meeting, and promptly cornered some of them. He urged them to carry out the price-monitoring committee's &quot;mandate&quot; to call an emergency conference to adjust production when OPEC prices, which currently average $14.50 a barrel, deviate &quot;significantly&quot; from the $18 benchmark.    Whatever the reason, the ministers of Algeria and Venezuela, who have supported Iran within OPEC, submitted proposals ultimately adopted -- after &quot;some strong language,&quot; one minister said. Later, the ministers were evasive about the motivation for the turnabout, although Mr. Nazer of Saudi Arabia said he was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the outcome.    Some oil traders and industry officials expect an immediate, though possibly brief, surge in world oil prices. Mr. Nabi, for one, said the calling of the conferences should send &quot;a very clear signal to the market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
