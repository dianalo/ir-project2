KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Jesse Helms withdrew objections Wednesdayto Senate confirmation of Army Maj. Gen. William F. Burns to headthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in a move linked to thelawmaker's battle against the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty.   Helms, R-N.C., told the Senate he never had any objectios toBurns or to his qualifications, which he said are ``excellent.''   The senator said he had delayed action on the Burns nominationin order to provide ammunition for his fight against the newIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which bans U.S. andSoviet missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.   He announced he has wrested a promise from the Reaganadministration to promptly release two reports bearing on allegedSoviet violations of arms control treaties and the effectiveness ofproposed verification of Soviet compliance with the new treaty.   But Helms demanded the administration also prepare a thirdreport _ confirming whether or not the Soviet Union has violatedthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty _ and make it availablebefore the Senate acts on the INF pact.   ``I would strenuously object to the Senate moving on this treatyuntil we get this information,'' Helms told reporters. ``I thinkthe Senate would go off half-cocked if it had no capability toassess these violations. They would be simply swept under the rugin an atmosphere of euphoria.''   Complaining the administration has ignored a treaty provisioncalling for such a review of compliance every five years, Helmsdrafted legislation declaring the United States ``is violating theABM treaty.''   He first offered it as an amendment to pending legislationrestricting the use of lie detectors in private businesses, thenwithdrew it, saying he will offer it later if necessary.   Helms contended a review of Soviet compliance would require theUnited States to protest ``at least one material breach of the ABMtreaty by Russia.''   The United States has long complained that the Soviets may beviolating the ABM treaty by building a radar system at Krasnoyarskin the central Soviet Union.   Helms made public an exchange of letters with President Reaganand Colin L. Powell, Reagan's national security adviser, in whichthe senator stated that Burns appears to be ``an excellentnominee.''   But he also complained that the arms control agency's failure toproduce the three reports ``clouds the current hearings'' over theINF treaty.   He said he has also ``received reports from witnessess thatlarge quantities of documents were shredded late last week'' inArms Control and Disarmament Agency offices ``under investigationby the FBI and GA0.'' The Government Accounting Office is theinvestigative arm of Congress.   Replying for Reagan, Powell said Burns has given personalassurances he will cooperate fully with the FBI and GAOinvestigations. But Powell did not comment on the alleged shreddingof documents as such.   He said the arms control agency's report on treaty violationswill be sent to Congress on March 8 and that the report on treatyverification will be delivered March 14.   But Powell said the administration believes it has until nextOctober before reviewing Soviet compliance with the terms of theABM treaty.   Helms called that a ``ruse'' and said the review was required tobe completed last Oct. 2. He said he believes the review has beendelayed so as not to interfere with Senate ratification of the INFpact.   Burns is currently principal deputy assistant secretary of statefor politico-military affairs. He served for four years as thePentagon's representative at the U.S.-Soviet negotiations on theINF treaty.   He would succeed Kenneth L. Adelman, who announced his intentionto retire last July.</TEXT></DOC>
