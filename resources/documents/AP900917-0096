Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., is sponsoring the firstHoover-ball Capital Classic on Sept. 29. The tournament, staged bythe Hoover Presidential Library Association, will be held onvolleyball courts on The Mall in Washington.   The game, likened by one participant to ``throwing a frozenturkey over your garage,'' blends elements of tennis andvolleyball. It pits two three-player teams against each other asthey heave a 6-pound medicine ball over an 8-foot volleyball net.   The game was devised in 1929 by Hoover's physician to help the31st president stay in shape and was played daily on the lawn ofthe White House while Hoover was in office.   ``President Hoover was a Hoover-ball fanatic,'' said Tom Walsh,the library association's executive director. ``He and a group ofother Washington VIPs - who were dubbed by The New York Times asHoover's `medicine ball cabinet' - played six mornings a week, rainor shine, beginning at 7 a.m. He even played the morning of March4, 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated.''   The game was forgotten until revived in 1988 for a nationaltournament at the Hoover library and museum in West Branch,Hoover's birthplace. The 1990 tournament last month attracted 50teams.   ``We're expecting at least a dozen teams in Washington,'' Walshsaid.   He said teams were being organized by Hatfield's staff and bythe staffs of Iowa's Sens. Tom Harkin and Charles Grassley and Rep.Tom Tauke.</TEXT></DOC>
