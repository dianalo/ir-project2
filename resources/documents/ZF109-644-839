 In the age of graphical user interfaces andthree-dimensional spreadsheets, word processing is still the primary functionof most personal computers, and the most hotly competitive market in PCsoftware.andM;A few years ago, analysts predicted that the advent of the word processorwould be followed by the paperless office.andP;  Instead, the computer has leddirectly to the greatest increase in paper consumption since the early daysof movable type.andP;  As word processors have grown in power and flexibility,they have made it possible to print documents with a complexity and elegancethat was available only to professional print shops not so many years ago.andO;And they have made it possible to format book-length documents in minutes.andO;But the very latest generation of word processors can do something more.andO;They let you create an automated document of a kind that was never possiblebefore.andP;  An automated document can collect data from a spreadsheet ordatabase, transform that data into a graph, prompt a user to enter additionaldata, and then issue commands that will cause the document to print itself ortransmit itself via electronic mail to a remote computer for furtherautomated processing.andM;GRAPHIC DETAILSandM;Almost three years ago, in the February 29, 1988, issue of PC Magazine (&quot;WordProcessing.andP;  Fast, Flexible, and Forward-looking&quot;), we tested 55 wordprocessing programs ranging from simple memo-writers to enormous corporateand professional packages.andP;  The best packages available then are still amongthe best available now, but for the first time since the advent of the PC, anentirely new class of word processors has emerged--the graphics-basedprograms, designed mostly for the Microsoft Windows environment, that let youcreate and edit text on a screen that directly represents the printed page.andO;We evaluated five such packages last summer (&quot;The Graphical Advantage:Tomorrow's Word Processors Today,&quot; PC Magazine, July 1990).andM;Like early character-based word processors hobbled by PCs with dual floppydisk drives and no hard disk, today's graphics-based programs are limited bythe hardware on which they run.andP;  Although many functions of the best GUI wordprocessors are impressively swift, as PC Labs' benchmark tests demonstrate,the simple task of entering and editing text still feels sluggish in theseprograms--even at 33 MHz with a fast video card.andP;  Printing, the one area inwhich you would expect graphics-based programs to excel, is actually wherethey lag behind.andP;  The best available printing, both in speed and flexibility,is offered by character-based WordPerfect--although the blame for the morelimited printing in Ami Professional and Microsoft Word for Windows partlyrests with Microsoft Windows itself and not those specific applications.andM;Word processors inspire fierce, often fanatical loyalty among their users,and once you've learned one, it isn't easy to recognize the merits ofanother.andP;  Devotees of WordStar's control-key interface are baffled byWordPerfect's function keys, and users of Microsoft Word's cascade ofalphabetical menus are puzzled by both.andP;  Now, however, the industry seems tobe converging on a standard Windows-style interface of Alt-letter pull-downmenus, each with first-letter shortcuts.andP;  Among character-based programs,WordPerfect and WordStar include such menus as an option, and MultiMate hassimilar menus; the next version of Microsoft Word will abandon the old Wordinterface for the emerging industry standard, although it will include diskswith the older interface for those who don't want to switch.andM;FEATURE SETSandM;Choosing a word processor is more than a question of choosing among keyboardinterfaces or between a graphics and a character-based program.andP;  Each oftoday's word processors includes a different set of conveniences that aren'tdirectly related to word processing, and you can avoid hours of frustrationby making sure the program you buy has the conveniences you need.andP;  Mostadvanced programs now include document summaries, file searching, and similarfeatures needed in large offices.andP;  WordPerfect even lets you shield usersfrom the DOS directory structure by creating long &quot;aliases&quot; for bothdirectory and file names.andP;  MultiMate, XyWrite, and Nota Bene are among thefew programs that can display a directory tree.andM;People who use word processors that let them open more than one file at atime feel claustrophobic if they're told to use a program that lets them openonly one.andP;  Most advanced programs now open two windows, but the DOS versionof Microsoft Word gives you eight, and Word for Windows gives you nine.andP;  AmiProfessional also gives you nine, but at a greater cost in memory.andP;  All majorword processors support outline numbering, but only Microsoft Word, Word forWindows, and Lotus's Manuscript offer full support for collapsible outlinesthat make it possible to build highly structured documents while looking atone or two screens.andM;Virtually all advanced word processors will let you restore text deletedearlier.andP;  WordPerfect keeps track of your last three deletions; AmiProfessional optionally remembers four; the next version of Nota Bene willremember five.andP;  Most programs let you attach nonprinting comments to fileson-screen the way you attach Post-it notes to documents on paper, and somegive you the option of printing them.andM;Surprisingly, not all word processors automatically keep track of where pagesend or begin.andP;  All major programs can automatically break pages when youfirst enter text, but many forget to reformat when you add or remove text orwhen you change margins and fonts.andP;  WordPerfect and Nota Bene are virtuallythe only programs that are always ready to print the current page withoutmaking you type in its page number or reformatting first.andP;  Microsoft Word canrepaginate in the background, but if you want the best possible speed fromAmi Professional and Word for Windows, you have to work in an unformatteddraft mode that pays no attention to page breaks at all.andP;  Worst of all intreatment of pages are DisplayWrite and MultiMate, which invariably needreformatting after extensive editing.andM;Other features to look for are annotations for group editing, redlining andstrikeout to keep track of revisions, and links to spreadsheets and databasefiles.andP;  Most programs now import graphics.andP;  However, you have to chooseeither full-featured graphics programs loosely integrated into the largerprogram, as an extensive subset of Inset is included in MultiMate and alesser subset of the same program in WordStar, or less powerful but fullyintegrated graphics control, as in WordPerfect, or fully integrated andhigh-powered drawing tools as in Ami Professional.andM;PRESSING FOR BETTER PRINTINGandM;Five years after the arrival of the desktop laser printer, some programs arestill designed primarily for the fixed-pitch fonts of dot matrix and daisywheel printers.andP;  DisplayWrite and MultiMate still have to perform specialgyrations before they can print proportional text with line breaks where theybelong.andP;  Most other programs now calculate correct line breaks as you type,but among character-based programs, only Microsoft Word and Nota Bene let youpress a key or two to switch from a screen option that displays true linebreaks--and forces you to scroll past the right edge of the screen to read acomplete line--to an option that breaks the lines to fit the screen.andP;  Otherprograms make you change fonts if you want your text to fit the screen.andM;Even when virtually all laser printers support multiple character sets, onlyWordPerfect gives you a simple way to enter a copyright or trademark symbolinto your file and be certain that it will print, no matter which font youchoose.andP;  Of competing programs, Nota Bene is the only major program that hasbuilt-in support for foreign alphabets and foreign keyboards.andM;CONVERSIONandM;No word processor is an island.andP;  The best-equipped programs come withconversion utilities to take in files from other packages, but MultiMate isone of the few programs that import directly and transparently.andP;  Most majorword processing formats can now be imported directly into desktop publishingprograms like PageMaker or Ventura Publisher, but if you buy a recentlyreleased word processor, it may take a few months for your DTP package tocatch up.andM;Some packages, notably WordPerfect, have given rise to small industries ofadd-on products.andP;  Windows-based word processors offer you the freedom to useother programs written for the same environment to perform tasks that can'tbe performed by the word processor itself.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;These reviews cover the eight top-selling word processors in today's market,according to the latest available figures from Dataquest, a market researchfirm: Samna's Ami Professional (and its little brother, the original Ami),IBM's DisplayWrite 5, Microsoft Word, Ashton-Tate's MultiMate, SoftwarePublishing's Professional Write, WordPerfect, and WordStar--as well asMicrosoftWord for Windows, one of our Editor's Choices from the July 1990evaluation (Ami Pro was the other).andP;  Six of these are full-featuredprofessional word processors; the odd man out is Professional Write, anexecutive-level word processor with a smaller set of features designed forease of use.andP;  The original Ami should also be counted among executivepackages.andP;  If you look at the features table, you'll notice that ProfessionalWrite doesn't attempt to match the features of larger programs, but it isn'tdesigned to, and its size and price mean that you should consider itseparately.andP;  For a look at other popular packages and the word processingportions of three integrated packages, see the sidebar &quot;Low-Cost Options forEasy Word Processing.&quot;andM;The best-sellers are not always the best performers.andP;  Three years ago, PCMagazine's Editor's Choices went to Microsoft Word, Nota Bene, Qandamp;A Write,WordPerfect, and XyWrite.andP;  The three not reviewed in this issue remain strongcontenders.andP;  New versions of Nota Bene and XyWrite are due to appear by theend of this year or early in 1991 and will be reviewed in the First Lookssection as soon as they arrive.andP;  Meanwhile, if you're in the market for a newword processor, one of the programs reviewed in this issue probably has mostof the features and conveniences you're looking for, and provides them withan ease and speed you wouldn't have imagined possible a few years ago.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;Most users have a monogamous relationship with their word processor--althoughmany established this relationship after a divorce from their first hastilychosen program.andP;  If you're comfortable with the program you use, don't letanyone convince you to switch--even if it's one that few others could bear tobe in the same room with--because it would probably be harder to acquaintyourself with a new program, even if it's friendlier or more glamorous.andM;If you do plan to switch, for yourself or your organization, decide whetheryou plan to remain in the character-based DOS world or move onward to thebrave new world of GUIs.andP;  That's a decision your computer may make for you:Unless you have a 20-MHz 386- or 486-based machine, a character-based programwill give you far better performance.andP;  Of course, the ease of using aGUI-based program may outweigh the speed penalty.andM;Among the top-selling character-based word processors, the clear winner isWordPerfect.andP;  No other program includes its range of options, conveniences,or high-powered functions.andP;  Its pull-down menus provide an easy alternativeto its sometimes recalcitrant function-key interface.andP;  Its printer control isunmatched among PC software, and it supports every printer in the knownuniverse.andP;  Its macros and mail-merge make possible a highly automated office,and it stands at the focus of a growing industry of add-ons.andP;  You can tradefiles with WordPerfect versions for virtually every other major computerplatform, and WordPerfect Office integrates WordPerfect with local and widearea networks.andP;  Toll-free support remains an inestimable bonus.andM;Where WordPerfect is weakest, Microsoft Word is strongest.andP;  Word'scollapsible outlining and easy-to-manage formatting via stylesheets should bynow have been emulated by every other word processor, but nothing else comesclose--except Word for Windows.andP;  The DOS version of Word is also strong onmacros and merge; and its eight editing windows--including windows forfootnotes and annotations--make complex editing tasks a breeze.andP;  Loyal usersare about to face Version 5.5, which completely overhauls the quirky Wordinterface but adds no new functions.andP;  Unlike WordPerfect, with itscombination of pull-down menus and function keys, Word won't let you useeither interface interchangeably; you have to install the new or the old.andM;PC Magazine's earlier character-based Editor's Choices still hold their own.andO;XyWrite and Nota Bene (built around the XyWrite engine) provide editingoptions unavailable even in Word and WordPerfect.andP;  XyWrite remains themainstay of the publishing industry, while Nota Bene offers the best academicword processing.andP;  New versions of both are expected soon.andM;Among GUI word processors, Ami Professional has the friendliest interface andthe widest range of functions, including charts, drawing, and bitmap imageenhancement.andP;  With its frame-oriented layout, it straddles the border betweenword processing and desktop publishing packages and is easier to use thanalmost any program with comparable powers.andP;  The most surprising thing aboutAmi Professional is that when you try the most straightforward way to doanything, it almost always works.andP;  Ami Professional can exchange files withits smaller sibling Ami, which has many strong word processing functions butlacks advanced graphics features.andM;With its innovative fields and highly programmable macros, Microsoft Word forWindows breaks new ground in PC software.andP;  More complex and difficult thanAmi Professional, it also includes a deeper and fuller set of word processingfeatures and manages to avoid virtually all the function-limiting compromisesfound in GUI programs.andP;  Word for Windows is as fine and powerful a graphicalword processor as the best character-based programs.andP;  Some of its menus aretricky, but it makes automated documents of a kind you've never imagined.andM;An honorable mention goes to Professional Write, a professional-class programthat lacks many of the high-powered functions of more-expensive packages butincludes an impressive number of features.andP;  Professional Write carries thetypewriter metaphor a bit far--the editing screen is sometimes occupiedmostly by the top and bottom margins of your pages--but few programs are assimple and straightforward to use.andP;  If you're reading this magazine, you canprobably manage a more difficult package, but if you live or work withsomeone who needs something simple, Professional Write is an obvious choice.andO;If the rest of the office uses WordPerfect, however, the choice for theprofessional-class user should probably be WordPerfect Corp.'s newprofessional-and-laptop-level spinoff, LetterPerfect.andM;WORD PROCESSORS:andM;SUITABILITY TO TASKandM;PC Magazine assesses a word processing program's suitability in fiveareas--Personal, Professional, Corporate, Legal, and Desktop Publishing--andassigns a point value for each one.andP;  These subjective ratings, on a scalefrom 0 to 4, are presented along with each review, and translate as follows:0--lacks features or is not at all suited; 1--poorly suited; 2--somecapability; 3--well-suited; 4--ideal for the task.andM;A Personal word processor should be very easy to learn and use; it is bestsuited for short documents, letters, and memos.andP;  Important features includecontext-sensitive help, simple menus, and clear documentation.andP;  The mostcommon users are students, home users, executives, and other professionalswho write short documents.andM;A Professional word processor is more full-featured.andP;  It should be able tohandle long documents with extensive page formatting, including complexheaders, footers, and indexing.andP;  Print control and dictionary support arealso important, and likely users include professional and technical writers,students, and those working in the publishing industry.andM;Corporate word processors should easily handle short documents, letters, andrepetitive memos that are produced often, and should offer mail-merge.andO;Document summaries (including author, revisor, keywords) and envelopeprinting are musts.andP;  Parallel versions running on IBM and DEC mainframes andminis, or on Unix systems are a plus.andP;  Note that not all users withincorporations are corporate users.andM;Legal refers to the program's ability to provide the special functions andformats required by lawyers and law offices, including line numbering,redlining and revision marking, compilation of tables of authorities, filecomparison, and password protection.andM;Word processors with Desktop Publishing features must be able to handlemultiple columns of text, import common graphics files (.PCX, .CGM, TIFF) aswell as Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel spreadsheet data.andP;  They should also be capablefront ends and partners for Aldus PageMaker and Ventura Publisher.andM;To receive a rating of 4, the product should provide all features that usersexpect now (based on competitive products) or will find on similar productsin the near future (a DTP rating of 4 indicates a word processor withsuperior DTP features, but not a word processor equal to PageMaker or VenturaPublisher).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
