Uzzell</HL><DD> 11/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTEXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   After nearly five years, what has &quot;education reform&quot; actually produced? The answer is becoming painfully clear: mostly higher spending and taxes.    Public-school leaders complain about &quot;cuts,&quot; but their budgets have been flourishing. In 1980 the combined federal, state and local tab for elementary and secondary schooling was $104 billion. It is now $169 billion. Spending per pupil grew an inflation-adjusted 7% from 1979 to 1983, the year those leaders started the current &quot;reform&quot; movement. It has since grown twice as fast -- 14%.    Some say that more spending is necessary for educational excellence. This argument ignores the fact that the U.S. already spends more than nations with markedly superior performance -- 6.7% of gross national product, compared with Japan's 5.7% and West Germany's 4.5%. But it has persuaded dozens of states to raise taxes, with state legislators often earmarking them specifically for education and boasting that they will finance popular changes such as merit pay for teachers.    That boast is hollow. With a few honorable exceptions, such as New Jersey's radical deregulation of teacher licensing, most new education spending has flowed into status-quo programs. Only a minuscule fraction has financed genuine reform.    A study just published by New York University's Center for Education Finance finds that less than $6 billion of the $650 billion spent on public schooling since 1983 has been allocated to reforms -- about 1%. Its author, Deborah Inman, predicts that &quot;at the present rate of expenditures, states will never implement comprehensive education reform.&quot;    Ms. Inman's analysis has limitations: It depends on a survey of state governments, and she concedes that &quot;a reform may be implemented and funded as an additive program in one state and as an integral part of the school program and its funding in another.&quot; But since the survey accepts at face value whatever state officials call &quot;reform&quot; -- including such items as teacher pay increases, with or without improved standards -- it overstates qualitative change.    Consider Florida. Four years ago its Legislature enacted a massive &quot;Educational Reform Act,&quot; widely hailed as a model for other states. It included a merit-pay provision, which then-Gov. Bob Graham used as a major selling point for a $230 million tax increase. In an extraordinary move for a federal cabinet officer, then-Education Secretary Terrel Bell personally lobbied the state's legislators to vote for this tax increase.    Floridians are still paying higher taxes, but merit pay is dead. From the beginning the plan was tilted toward teachers with paper credentials, such as seniority and graduate credits. It did have a ceiling on the number of teachers who could be designated as outstanding, but in 1986 the legislators repealed even that. They substituted a &quot;Career Achievement Program&quot; with the specifics to be worked out in each district -- by collective bargaining with the teachers union.    Mr. Bell's successor, William Bennett, calls merit pay &quot;a genuine, original and indispensable article of education reform&quot;; more than half the states claim to have enacted it. But only one -- Tennessee -- has a plan that truly fits the definition originally offered by the Council for Basic Education: one &quot;in which some teachers get more pay than others as a result of a conscious judgment that they are more competent.&quot; Even that one has been watered down.    At the federal level the principal effect of &quot;reform&quot; has been to legitimize the Education Department, whose press releases are now filled with reformist rhetoric but whose huge spending programs have seen little change since the Carter years. The symbolism of &quot;reform&quot; has protected even such obvious pork barrel as &quot;impact aid&quot; for schools attended by children of federal employees.    Conservatives and liberals agree that this program in effect transfers money from less affluent to more affluent communities; every president since Eisenhower has tried to cut it. Ronald Reagan succeeded -- temporarily. The program has been growing again since 1983, and a House-passed bill would now boost it almost all the way back to the 1980 level. The bill is called the &quot;School Improvement Act.&quot;    Reagan appointees have mounted only token resistance to such legislation. Secretary Bennett dutifully defends the administration's budget proposals at congressional hearings but has not made one speech on the subject outside the Beltway. Now he wants to do even less: He is resisting the cuts that the Office of Management and Budget seeks for fiscal 1989. He argues -- correctly -- that Congress will reject such cuts anyway. But his pre-emptive surrender will just make it easier for the public-school lobbyists to frame the debate on their terms: To be &quot;pro-education&quot; is to be pro-spending.    Those lobbyists have succeeded in defining &quot;reform&quot; in such a way as to protect their core interests, such as compulsory teachers unions and top-heavy administrative agencies. With the help of organizations such as the National PTA (whose membership has grown for each of the last five years -- after a 20-year decline), they have even managed to present those interests and the consumer's as virtually identical.    From the PTA's &quot;Legislative Directives&quot; for 1987-88, one would think that none of its members were taxpayers rather than tax-eaters. The organization explicitly supports &quot;efforts by Congress to increase the federal revenue base in order to adequately fund education and child related programs and to reduce the federal deficit&quot; -- in short, tax increases. It accepts &quot;only those efforts by Congress to modify the budget and appropriations process that would not jeopardize funding for education and child related programs.&quot; It specifies impact aid as one of those programs.    The PTA's Washington lobbyists have worked against Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, President Reagan's 1986 tax-reform bill, the line-item veto and the balanced-budget amendment. Appropriately, they are based in the headquarters of the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union.    The PTA, the NEA and their allies have succeeded in luring many corporations into what Xerox Corp. Chairman David Kearns calls &quot;feel-good&quot; partnerships in which &quot;business lets education frame the problem and set the agenda.&quot; Mr. Kearns correctly observes that such partnerships &quot;hurt more than they help, because they keep shoring up a system that needs deep structural changes.&quot;    The public-school establishment has built one of the country's most reform-proof special interests, turning even its educational failures into political victories. The less children learn, the more money the monopoly demands -- and gets.    ---   Mr. Uzzell, an editorial writer for the Scripps Howard News Service, was an Education Department official during 1981-82 and briefly in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
