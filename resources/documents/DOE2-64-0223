Two experimental variants are included,the input and the output method. An evaluation of the combined effectswith regard to additive and nonadditive cases is realized by means ofinput values (exposure levels) in the first procedure and by means ofoutput values (effect levels) in the second procedure. A graphic representationof the results is possible by both procedures. The application of themethods is demonstrated by the example of the combined influence of noiseand vibration on organism.</TEXT></DOC>
