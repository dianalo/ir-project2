Chrysler said that without the washer, the cable may come loose by slipping past a retaining clip. That action could hold the carburetor partially open and prevent it from returning to the idle position when the driver's foot is lifted from the accelerator pedal.    The auto maker, which will correct the condition free of charge to owners, said that it hasn't heard of any accidents or injuries because of the problem. </TEXT></DOC>
