Although large hydrocarbon reserves have been found in youngerPaleozoic and Mesozoic rocks, the Devonian System still ranks as themajor oil producing interval in Alberta, accounting for over 60% of recoverablegas reserves. This paper gives an overview of the stratigraphy, paleogeography,and geological evolution of the Devonian System and some of its hydrocarbonreservoirs in Alberta. Before addressing the Devonian record specifically,the Phanerozoic evolution of the Alberta Basin is briefly summarized.8 refs., 18 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
