Gen. Paul Vessey, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, learned of the aid from a Saudi representative who assumed the officer knew already, according to former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, who testified that he raised the issue later with the same Saudi official.    &quot;He indicated that it had happened inadvertently,&quot; Adm. Poindexter said in regard to the Saudi contributions, which had begun in 1984. &quot;He had told him, but he assumed Gen. Vessey knew about it.&quot;    The comments are part of extensive depositions released yesterday, covering closed-door testimony by Adm. Poindexter prior to his public appearance in July before the House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair. The hundreds of pages of transcripts and accompanying documents complement the public record and shed new light on the administration's internal deliberations on so-called third countries in the operation.    Adm. Poindexter reveals a wariness toward Israeli officials who, according to his testimony, indicated they were unaware of the large profits being made by their middlemen on early arms sales to Iran.    The former security adviser said he was never &quot;completely comfortable&quot; with former National Security Council consultant Michael Ledeen, who was close to Iranian businessman and arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar, and Adm. Poindexter said he subsequently forced Mr. Ledeen out of the operation as the U.S. took more control of the arms dealings in January 1986.    Adm. Poindexter's depositions also highlight the role of Naval Cmdr. Paul Thompson, former NSC legal counsel, who is believed to have been present when the admiral destroyed a controversial 1985 presidential finding related to the early arms sales to Iran. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh increasingly is focusing on Cmdr. Thompson's actions, and prosecutors believe he was a central player in the damage-control effort to try to protect President Reagan, according to law-enforcement officials.    Other former White House aides have testified under oath that Cmdr. Thompson &quot;knew everything that Poindexter knew&quot; about most covert operations and that he was present when Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North shredded and tried to hide papers from Attorney General Edwin Meese's assistants in the early days of the Justice Department's inquiry into the brewing scandal. Cmdr. Thompson couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Like his later public testimony, Adm. Poindexter's depositions reflect an almost fierce preoccupation with secrecy and a general wariness toward most of the president's advisers and Cabinet, except for Mr. Meese and the late director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Casey.    Describing an early December 1985 meeting on the Iran initiative, Adm. Poindexter testified that Mr. Casey effectively gave him his &quot;proxy&quot; to support the plan, and he characterized the decision to run the operation through Col. North as the director's decision. &quot;Bill chose to run it that way,&quot; he testified. &quot;I agreed with him.&quot;    Even before becoming the national security adviser, Adm. Poindexter, a computer buff, gave Col. North a special code to keep his communications secret from fellow NSC workers. This decision in August 1985 was at least &quot;indirectly&quot; related to congressional inquiries into the Marine officer's activities, he said.    While defending the use of third-country donations such as those from Saudi Arabia, Adm. Poindexter's testimony indicates the issue was considered extremely sensitive within the administration, which delayed seeking congressional approval for such solicitations out of fear of the lawmakers' reaction.    Beginning in 1984, Saudi Arabia quickly became the chief source of funds for the insurgents, and Taiwan secretly funneled $2 million later through Col. North's private network. While there is no evidence that Israel made cash contributions, it is believed to have been a source for arms, and Adm. Poindexter's testimony confirms that there were discussions regarding Jerusalem's sending Spanish-speaking advisers to Central America.    Documents released yesterday further disclose new ties between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Col. North, who dubbed his Contra-resupply network &quot;Project Democracy.&quot; In a July 1986 memo to Adm. Poindexter, Col. North said that Oliver Revell, head of the FBI's criminal investigations, &quot;asked to meet with the Project Democracy security officer&quot; to obtain information that could help the bureau keep tabs on an outspoken critic of the administration's Central American policies who allegedly threatened to assassinate the president.    The activities of that administration critic, Jack Terrell, who was under investigation by the FBI and what Col. North called the network's unofficial &quot;security apparatus,&quot; were described in a later memo that went directly to the president. The memo to Mr. Reagan didn't mention the unofficial investigation, but speculated that Mr. Terrell was involved with congressional panels looking into &quot;the role of U.S. government officials in illegally supporting the Nicaraguan resistance.&quot;    Mr. Terrell was out of the country and couldn't be reached for comment, and the FBI declined to comment.    &quot;I didn't think that the Contras would have survived if it hadn't been for Col. North, and I very likely would have passed that on to the president,&quot; the admiral testified. But during a pointed cross-examination, he sought to insulate the White House and himself from the details of the final diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales.    He indicated that as early as January 1986, Col. North portrayed retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord as &quot;losing money&quot; because of his involvement in assisting the Contras. Even after being questioned about the huge profit margins for the early arms sales to Iran, Adm. Poindexter spoke in terms of only &quot;several&quot; million dollars being left for the Contras. </TEXT></DOC>
