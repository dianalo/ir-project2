The profit increase was in line with analysts' expectations and was considered a good performance for a company that has had its share of troubles in the past year. But the dividend announcement disappointed some investors, and Siemens's shares fell three marks in Frankfurt trading yesterday, to 470 marks ($269.34).    Siemens's net income rose to 1.4 billion marks ($802.3 million) from 1.28 billion marks the previous year, while sales rose 16%, to 59.4 billion marks ($34.04 billion) from 51.4 billion marks.    The earnings increase followed a 13% decline in the previous fiscal year that led Siemens to cut its dividend last November to 11 marks from 12 marks. Since then, senior management has begun a sweeping reorganization designed to break the company's lethargy and reposition Siemens in the global electronics market.    Separately, Nixdorf AG, West Germany's second-largest computer maker behind Siemens, said it is likely to cut its current dividend of 10 marks. Nixdorf's shares fell 15.50 marks, to 390.50 marks.    Chairman Klaus Luft had been quoted as saying after a presentation in Boston Monday that flat profit in 1988 would be sufficient to maintain Nixdorf's current dividend. In a release issued yesterday, Nixdorf said it couldn't comment on its expected 1988 results. However, it hinted that last year's profit of 264 million marks wouldn't be reached this year.    &quot;The decline in prices and margins has intensified in recent months,&quot; Nixdorf said. It also said previous forecasts of an 11% sales gain in 1988 couldn't be &quot;confirmed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
