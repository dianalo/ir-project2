Pandick said that about 90% of its 9.9 million shares outstanding had been tendered to the management group. The group's offer had been scheduled to expire at noon EST yesterday, but was extended to 5 p.m.    The $251 million buyout thwarts a rival $28-a-share, or $305 million, offer from a unit of Service Resources Corp. Although the alternative offer was higher, some questions had been raised about the financing arrangements made by Charles P. Young andamp; Co., the Service Resources subsidiary making the bid.    Nevertheless, Charles P. Young attempted to press ahead with its bid after a special committee of the Pandick board refused to approve its merger offer late Sunday night.    Pandick and Young are financial printers. Service Resources provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies.    Young bought about 300,000 Pandick shares on the open market early yesterday. It also filed a motion in a Delaware court seeking a temporary restraining order blocking the buyout by the Pandick management group. But, when the court denied Young's motion, the company capitulated and said it would withdraw its offer and tender the shares it had bought to the Pandick management group.    Service Resources may have lost more than just the chance to acquire Pandick. As it purchased Pandick shares yesterday morning, the price rose to $26.375, or 87.5 cents above the price offered by the management group. The stock later fell back and closed at $25.25, down 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, on volume of 1.3 million shares.    Patrick J. Rooney, Service Resources' chairman, said that his losses were small. &quot;I got a very good price,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;I lost a very minor amount of money.&quot;    Young apparently had hoped that arbitragers, who were believed to hold between 65% and 70% of Pandick's common shares, would opt for its higher bid. But many arbitragers, uneasy about Young's financial arrangements, decided to go along with the management group's offer, despite its lower price. &quot;These guys are coming in at $28 a share,&quot; said one arbitrager, referring to the Young offer, &quot;but you don't know if they have the money or not.&quot;    As previously reported, Service Resources said it had assurances that Trafalgar Holdings Inc., a Los Angeles-based investment company, could arrange commitments for as much as $150 million in senior bank financing. Service Resources said it also had a &quot;highly confident letter&quot; indicating that McKinley Allsopp Inc., an investment subsidiary of Merchants Bank of Boston, could provide $105 million in junior subordinated debt and $20 million of preferred stock. In addition, Young had said it had a proposal for $25 million in equity financing from a third party, Gerschel andamp; Co.    The Pandick committee said it rejected the Young proposal because it found &quot;significant uncertainties regarding the ability of Charles P. Young to secure the necessary financing.&quot; It said that Trafalgar and McKinley Allsopp, the principal institutions arranging financing for the Young offer, lacked sufficient experience in transactions of this type and size.    Accordingly, the committee said it didn't see any reason to rescind its earlier approval of the Pandick management group's buyout proposal. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    Closely held Trafalgar is controlled by Charles W. Knapp, former chairman of Financial Corp. of America, who resigned in 1984. Mr. Knapp is the subject of lawsuits stemming from his role in directing aggressive lending policies that allegedly resulted in major losses for the company's American Savings andamp; Loan subsidiary. Since Mr. Knapp formed Trafalgar in 1985, the company has been rebuffed in several attempts to participate in major financing ventures.    In Los Angeles, Mark Dodge, Trafalgar's general counsel, said the Pandick committee's comment regarding its capability was &quot;cavalier and motivated to keep (Pandick) insulated from liability. The bid for which we gave (financing) commitment was for a higher price.&quot; He added that Trafalgar is &quot;currently involved in arranging several hundred million dollars in financing for a number of clients in a variety of corporate finance transactions.&quot;    In a telephone interview from Boston, John R. Lakian, chairman of Merchants Bank was philosophical about the Pandick committee's decision. &quot;I don't think it's unusual that if you aren't a name player on Wall Street that people think you aren't able to complete this type of transaction,&quot; Mr. Lakian said. &quot;We have never made any commitment that we haven't fulfilled. They had a bird in the hand versus one in the bush. Maybe that was the safe way to go but it didn't give the shareholder the higher price.&quot;    As reported earlier, the Pandick management group said it had secured $220 million in financing from Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Toronto-Dominion Bank. In addition, Rock Capital Partners LP, Morgan Capital Corp. and certain Pandick executives were to provide as much as $65 million more in equity financing. </TEXT></DOC>
