But the committee chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said hewanted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to report on theeffects of the Oct. 13 stock market drop before legislation toreauthorize the agency reaches the Senate floor.   The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestryvoted Thursday to send the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989for consideration to the full Senate.   ``This will be the toughest futures reform package adopted bythis committee in more than a decade,'' said Leahy, who introducedthis bill last month along with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., thecommittee's ranking Republican.   The bill, introduced in the wake of a series of fraud andracketeering indictments at the nation's two largest futuresexchanges, seeks to impose a number of reforms including tougherstandards on exchanges for the reconstruction of transactions,known as the audit trail.   Audit trails enable regulators to determine the timing andsequences of trades as a guard against fraud.   But amendments to the bill will give the CFTC authority toexempt very small exchanges from the new standards.   The bill also would expand the CFTC's authority to collectservice fees to fund its surveillance of trading floors. Anotheramendment, however, placed a cap on the size of those fees.   The bill does not restrict computer-driven program trading inthe financial markets.   A similar bill already has been passed by the House.   But Leahy released a letter he wrote the CFTC Oct. 17, askingthe agency to evaluate the cooperation and communication betweenexchanges and regulators in the securities and futures marketsduring the 190-point market drop on Friday the 13th.   Leahy sought a preliminary report before the Congress completeswork on the reauthorization bill so ``if the CFTC finds reforms areneeded, I want to be able to implement them quickly.''</TEXT></DOC>
