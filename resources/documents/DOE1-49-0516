From those TDCs the authors calculate mean transit time (MTT)values using a modified transit time theory. This theory is applied toTDCs of the brain ascertained using digital subtraction angiography (DSA).The theory excludes the problems of densitometry. MTT values help todecide whether a stenosis is relevant to the brain tissue or nor. Functionalimages of the regional distribution of transit times can be generatedwith excellent spatial resolution (512 x 512 pixel matrix). They areof high diagnostic quality and correlate strongly with blood flow distributionpatterns. Function and morphology can be assessed with only one examination,and ischemic foci are demonstrated. The results in 50 patients are reported.</TEXT></DOC>
