SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rainy autumn helped ease the dryness in theEast and some Central states, but large areas of the Upper Midwestare facing winter still in the grip of long-term drought.   ``Subsurface soil moisture is still very low in a lot ofstates,'' Douglas LeComte, a meteorologist with the Department ofAgriculture, said Tuesday. ``That could come back to haunt us nextspring.''   ``We still have lingering effects from the drought so we willdefinitely have to watch the winter rainfall, to see if the soilmoisture gets replenished,'' he said.   Fall rainfall eased the problem in the Southeast _ especiallyrains from tropical storms, LeComte said. And moisture has improvedin the Ohio, middle Missouri and lower Mississippi valleys.   But the federal Climate Analysis Center lists conditions ofextreme long-term drought as continuing in North Dakota, Idaho,Wyoming, most of Montana and portions of South Dakota, Minnesota,Iowa, Oregon and California.   Much of that region received less than half of normalprecipitation during the year that ended Aug. 31, and an even largerregion received 75 percent or less during that 12-month period.   Severe drought also extends to surrounding areas, as well asparts of North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio andVirginia.   The assessments are based on the Palmer Drought Index, a complexlong-term measurement that considers rainfall, evaporation, soilmoisture and other factors.   Planting of the winter wheat crop _ which is done in the fall _is about complete, LeComte says, but problems may be lurking.   In Kansas, for example, he explained that seeding is nearcompletion, crop emergence is good, but lack of soil moisture may belimiting root development.   The West Coast, meanwhile, should be starting its normally wetseason as storms come ashore from the Pacific Ocean.   ``The West Coast has had two dry winters in a row and this winteris getting off to a slow start,'' LeComte added, noting that theregion depends on the winter snow pack to get through summer.   Reservoir carryover in much of the West is poor, due to heavy usefor irrigation this summer, according to the fall western watersupply summary issued by the Soil Conservation Service and NationalWeather Service.   ``In most regions of the West, the 1989 water year begins withlow soil moisture reserves, low reservoir carryover and deficitseasonal precipitation,'' the report states. The water year ismeasured from autumn to autumn.   The nation's overall shortage of moisture is no longer gettingthe attention it did a few weeks ago, thanks largely to threefactors: the end of the major farm growing season; a rise in riverlevels that improved barge traffic; and rains that eased the drynessin eastern areas.   But in the still affected areas, the outlook may be bleak.   ``With the start of the normally dry fall and winter months inthe northern Great Plains, prospects for significant precipitationto eliminate long-term dryness in the area appear unfavorable,'' theClimate Analysis Center said.   The Climate Analysis Center is no longer listing the drought inthe North Central states among major climate ``anomalies'' _ theunusual weather or climate events it studies. But that's onlybecause dryness is normal at this time of year.   In question is whether winter will bring sufficient snowfall, ornext spring will provide the rains needed to restore the soilmoisture to normal.   Weather watchers are not making forecasts yet for spring, but theNational Weather Service's 90-day outlook through the end of Januarycalls for lighter than normal snowfall over much of the UpperMidwest, particularly in the Great Lakes region, Idaho, Montana andWyoming.</TEXT></DOC>
