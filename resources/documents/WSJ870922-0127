Mr. Gelli, who is being held in Geneva's Champ d'Ollon prison -- from which he escaped in 1983 -- has been indicted in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano S.p.A., the 1980 bombing of a Bologna train station in which more than 80 people were killed, and in the P-2 Masonic Lodge affair. The P-2 case brought down the government of Arnaldo Forlani in 1981 when two cabinet ministers' names were found on the lodge's membership list.    In Switzerland, the 68-year-old Mr. Gelli faces charges of bribing a public official, which could carry a jail sentence of 4 1/2 years, according to Joerg Kistler, a Justice Ministry spokesman in Geneva. Mr. Gelli is said to have paid a guard to set him free four years ago; since then he is believed to have lived in South America, most recently in Uruguay.    Mr. Gelli will undergo medical examinations to determine whether he is fit to appear in court and face charges, which could occur as early as tomorrow, sources said. Mr. Gelli's lawyers said at a news conference in Geneva that he has severe heart problems; Geneva has one of the world's leading heart clinics.    The news that Mr. Gelli had returned but that he was in poor health was greeted with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. Although Mr. Gelli in the past has said P-2 was just a normal Masonic organization, it is anything but that to most Italians.    &quot;I'm waiting to hear his version of the truth, as told to the Italian magistrates,&quot; said Tina Anselmi, the Christian Democrat parliamentarian who led a 2 1/2-year investigation into the P-2 affair. That inquiry concluded that the lodge was a subversive organization that aimed to manipulate important state agencies.    Attilio Bastianini, a Liberal senator who studied the P-2 affair, said Mr. Gelli &quot;could shed a ray of light on many Italian mysteries.&quot; But the senator said there is a risk that the surrender could have been &quot;arranged&quot; by political forces and that Mr. Gelli &quot;could commit suicide&quot; in his cell. Mr. Bastianini was alluding to the mysterious prison poisoning of financier Michele Sindona, a friend of Mr. Gelli whose death was ruled a suicide but was considered suspicious by many.    It seemed possible last night that Mr. Gelli planned to talk to Italian authorities, but it was uncertain whether he would have the opportunity. The Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman said Mr. Gelli would have to serve his sentence in Switzerland before extradition could be considered. But RAI, the Italian state news network, reported that Mr. Gelli had written to Italian magistrates investigating the Banco Ambrosiano bankruptcy, offering to testify after he has heart surgery. The magistrates had been granted an extradition order for Mr. Gelli by the Swiss Supreme Court shortly after he escaped from prison.    The Italian magistrates believe Mr. Gelli and other P-2 members helped channel some of Ambrosiano's lost funds and have charged him with being an accessory to fraudulent bankruptcy. Banco Ambrosiano's late chairman, Roberto Calvi, was a member of the P-2 lodge. Mr. Gelli's arrest in 1982 came as he was trying to withdraw funds, believed to belong to the Milan bank, from an account at a Swiss bank.    The Milan judges aren't the only ones in Italy who would like to talk to this former fascist turned resistance fighter turned mattress salesman.    He is under investigation in Rome, Florence and Bologna on various charges, including belonging to an armed band, political and military espionage, conspiracy, subversive association, extortion and fraud. One of the bloodiest crimes he's accused of being involved in occurred in Bologna, where the trial for the 1980 train station bombing is under way. Mr. Gelli is a defendant along with Francesco Pazienza, the former secret agent recently extradited from the U.S.    Despite the grave accusations leveled against him, Mr. Gelli occasionally has communicated, through his attorneys, that he would like to return to Italy some day and set the record straight. Because of his age and his poor health, he might be eligible for house arrest instead of a prison cell while he waits to testify in the various trials.    Even though Mr. Gelli has been in hiding for four years, he has managed to remain in the public mind in Italy. One news magazine recently reported that he was planning to publish a tell-all memoir, and other journals said he had planned to run for Parliament last June. He seemed to know too much and was too close to power to drop out of sight forever.    The Geneva public prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Trembley, summed up the feelings of many in Italy last night when he said, &quot;I always knew I would see him again one day.&quot;    ---   Margaret Studer contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
