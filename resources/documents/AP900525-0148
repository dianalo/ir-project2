The four were convicted of genocide on Feb. 2 at the first majortrial of top officials of the Ceausescu regime and sentenced tolife imprisonment.   Emil Bobu, 62, former secretary of the Communist Party andthird-ranking member of Ceausescu's leadership; former statecouncil vice-president Manea Manescu, 74; politburo member IonDinca, 64; and former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59,admitted they backed Ceausescu's orders to put down the uprising.   The prosecution said they could have ended Ceausescu's 24-yearhold on power and prevented bloodshed.   Rompres said the maximum life sentences on the four defendantswould remain.   The military court at their trial ordered the seizure of allproperty including gold, jewels and large sums of money, andstripped them of their civil rights.   In March, the four ex-officials won a postponement of theirappeal after lawyers argued the need for international research forthe first such case in Romania's history. The prosecution agreed ongrounds the defense should have all necessary information.   During the appeal, heard in April, Postelnicu's lawyer arguedthat the interior minister was guilty of a lesser charge andManescu's lawyer asked that all charges against him be dismissed.   Postelnicu burst into tears asking for a 15-20 year prison term.He told the court he did not try to absolve himself of guilt and ofthe responsibility his position implied.   ``I am a bloody sinner and handicapped. Please do not think thatI try to play the hero now but I ordered them not to shoot atworkers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
