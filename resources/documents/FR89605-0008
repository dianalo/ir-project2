Introduction and Background </ITAG>The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') announcesthe adoption of Rule 19c-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').\1\<NOTE/> As of January 22, 1990, the effective date of this Rule,all national securities exchanges that provide a market for trading standardizedput or call options (``options exchanges'') are prohibited from restrictingthe listing of any new stock options class to a single exchange. In addition,the Rule provides that on January 21, 1991, no options exchange may havea rule that limits its ability to list any stock options class becausethat options class is listed on another options exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq.</T3>, as amended. Rule 19c-5 also provides a substantial phase-in period to reduce marketstructure and operational concerns. Specifically, the Rule does not takeeffect for almost eight months, until January 22, 1990. Commencing January22, 1990, no options exchange can limit its ability to list at any onetime up to ten standardized stock option classes overlying exchange-listedstocks that were also listed on another options exchange on or before January22, 1990.\2\<NOTE/> Further, as of  January 22, 1990, no options exchange maylimit its ability to list any standardized options class first listed onanother options exchange on or after January 22, 1990, because that optionsclass is listed on another options exchange. The Rule, however, would notrestrict an options exchange's authority to choose, as a business matter,not to trade options already listed on another exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ These ten classes would be in addition to any option onan exchange-listed stock that was allowed to be traded on more than oneoptions exchange as of the effective date of this Rule (<T3>e.g.</T3>, options on Disney Productions, Xerox, and National Semiconductor).Thus, the ten additional classes would consist of options on individual,exchange-listed equity securities that have been assigned to trading ona single exchange since 1980 pursuant to the Allocation Plan. <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3> at note 86 and accompanying text. The Commission proposed the adoption of a multiple trading \3\<NOTE/> rule in a release issued on June 18, 1987, announcing thecommencement of a proceeding pursuant to Section 19(c) \4\<NOTE/> of the Act to consider whether to (1) adopt a policy permittingmultiple market trading of standardized options on exchange-listed securities,and/or (2) adopt a rule amending the rules of national securities exchangesthat provide a market in standardized options to remove restrictions onthe multiple trading of options on exchange-listed securities.\5\<NOTE/>  In connection with this proceeding the Commission solicitedcomment on proposed Rule 19c-5 and held public hearings on February 11,1988, to receive testimony from interested persons.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Multiple trading is the trading of standardized optionswith the same underlying security on more than one options exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(c)(1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24613 (June 18, 1987),52 FR 23849 (``Proposal Release''). The Commission today is adopting arule that subsumes the proposed policy, as well as the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A copy of the hearing transcript, together with all commentletters received in connection with this proceeding, is available in thePublic Reference Room at the Commission's home office in Washington, DC.<T3>See</T3> File No. S7-25-87. The Commission's proposed rule was announced after more than a ten-yearperiod during which the multiple trading of standardized options overlyingexchange-listed securities was limited to relatively few options classes.Between the commencement of multiple trading on standardized options in1976 and mid-1977, when the options exchanges agreed voluntarily to suspendfurther expansion of the options markets, only 22 options classes weremultiply-traded.\7\<NOTE/> Upon the termination of this options moratorium in 1980,the Commission precluded an immediate expansion in the number of multiplytraded options based upon its finding that, while multiple trading could,``under appropriate circumstances,'' \8\<NOTE/> benefit options investors, it raised a number of concerns.Among these concerns were: (1) Market fragmentation (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the failure of the prices in any one market to reflect allthe buying and selling interest in a security); (2) member firm order routingpractices that were automatically directing order flow to the market exhibitingthe greatest volume, regardless of whether or not that exchange was offeringthe best execution for each order so routed; and (3) the potential negativeimpact on the financial position of regional exchanges, which were dependenton revenues from their options trading programs. In light of these concerns,the Commission deferred making a decision regarding the expansion of multipletrading until the exchanges could undertake a study of the feasibilityof developing market integration facilities similar to those developedfor stock trading.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In 1977, the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'')agreed to halt expansion of standardized options trading in conjunctionwith the commencement of a Commission staff investigation into tradingpractices of the options markets. At the time of the moratorium's commencementthe number of multiply-traded classes had declined to fifteen. <T3>See</T3> Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets to theSecurities and Exchange Commission, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., 800-04 (Comm.Print 96-IFC3, December 22, 1978) (``Options Study Report''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16701 (March 26, 1980),45 FR 21426, 21431 (``Moratorium Termination Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Commission envisioned that a market integration systemwould provide a prompt and efficient means of sending and receiving ordersto purchase or sell multiply-traded options among options markets. <T3>Id</T3>. at 21431.In conjunction with its determination to defer expansion of multiple trading,the Commission requested the options exchanges to develop a fair meansfor allocating options then not listed on any exchange. The exchanges'plan, termed the ``Allocation Plan,'' and approved by the Commission in1980,\10\<NOTE/> permitted the options exchanges thereafter to list new optionsfor which they would be the sole market, and to remain the sole    marketfor existing options which were not multiple traded at that time.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16863 (May 30, 1980),45 FR 37928.  Following adoption of the Allocation Plan, the SROs submitted a reportto the Commission that concluded that the development of options marketintegration facilities, particularly a limit order exposure system \11\<NOTE/> suggested by the Commission, was not feasible at that time.\12\<NOTE/> Thereafter, the SROs made no substantial efforts to developany market integration facilities. As a result, options on exchange-listedequity securities continued to be listed for trading pursuant to the AllocationPlan.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The Commission envisioned that a limit order exposuresystem would provide for simultaneous representation of public limit ordersfrom all options exchanges and provide floor participants on those exchangeswith access to those public limit orders. <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Interim Report of the American, Pacific, and PhiladelphiaStock Exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange in Response to ReleaseNo. 34-16701 (January 8, 1981), <T3>see also </T3>Supplementary Report of the American, Pacific, and PhiladelphiaStock Exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange in Response to ReleaseNo. 34-16701 (September 1, 1981) (``Supplementary Task Force Report''). Despite the absence of options market integration facilities, the Commissionpermitted multiple-trading of new options products approved for tradingsubsequent to the termination of the options moratorium. In approving thesenew products, the Commission took the position that competitive marketforces should be allowed to shape the structure of the    options marketsto the maximum extent possible,\13\<NOTE/> and that multiple trading could benefit the market for theseproducts through enhanced price competition, improvements in exchange services,and innovation in contract design.\14\<NOTE/> Based largely upon these rationales,\15\<NOTE/> the Commission approved multiple trading for options on stockindexes,\16\<NOTE/> Treasury securities,\17\<NOTE/> foreign currencies,\18\<NOTE/> and OTC stocks.\19\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18297 (December 2, 1981),46 FR 60376, 60377-78. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22026 (May 8, 1985),50 FR 20310, 20330-31 (approving in principle proposals by the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc.

Thus, the OCE Study found that ``optionseligible for multiple listing have significantly lower spreads despitehaving virtually all their volume on a single exchange.''\24\<NOTE/> The findings of both studies were challenged by the CBOE,Phlx, and Pacific Stock Exchange (``PSE''), each of whom submitted a critiqueof the Studies prepared by an economist retained for that purpose.\25\<NOTE/> These critiques questioned the methodology of the Studiesand argued that, even if the conclusions of the Studies were accepted,they overestimated the cost savings that could be realized from multipletrading.\26\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See </T3>Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis, ``The Effectsof Multiple Trading on the Market for OTC Options,'' (November 1986) (``DEPAStudy''), and Office of the Chief Economist, ``Potential Competition andActual Competition in the Options Market,'' (November 1986) (``OCE Study'')(referred to collectively as ``Staff Studies'' or ``Studies''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The DEPA Study compared the spreads in Amex-listed optionson OTC stocks to those in singly-listed Amex options on exchange-listedstocks for three sample periods between June 1985 (shortly after tradingon OTC options began) and March 1986 (after trading volume had concentratedon one exchange, the Amex). The Study found that the spreads in multiply-tradedoptions were on average 19.8% narrower than the spreads in the singly-tradedoptions. DEPA Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 20, at 9. The OCE Study drew similar conclusions froma different sample pool, finding that multiple trading reduced spreadsby as much as 20% in low volume options.

The Commission foundthat no specific harm to the markets had resulted from multiple tradingof OTC options, including the absence of either significant price disparitiesbetween different markets in the same option class or significant problemswith the execution of customer orders. While the Commission reaffirmedits belief that market integration facilities may be beneficial in a multipletrading environment, it stated that, in view of the burden on competitionimposed by the Allocation Plan, it could not defer indefinitely its considerationof these issues in anticipation of exchange undertakings to develop suchfacilities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See </T3>sections 6(b)(8) and 23(a)(2) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8)and 78w(a)(2)(1982)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(1)(c)(ii)(1982)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See </T3>section 11A(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(1)(C)(i)(1982)].<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Recent Trading Experience and Studies </ITAG>In the Proposal Release, the Commission described the multiple tradingexperience in options on OTC stocks from the commencement of trading inJune 1985 to the time of the Release's issuance in June 1987. The Commissionfound that, within the first few weeks of multiple trading, the Amex capturedthe majority of order flow in each of the eight multiple-traded OTC optionsthat it listed, and within a few months had increased its market shareto almost 90% in each option class.\30\<NOTE/> By June 1987, only two of the original nine multiple-tradedOTC options continued to be multiple-traded, and in both instances theprimary market accounted for more than 99% of the volume.\31\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See </T3>Proposal Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, 52 FR at 23851. Amex market share in the first monthof trading was approximately as follows: Apollo, 72%; Apple, 77%; ChiChi's,94%; DSC, 64%; Intel, 81%; Intergraph, 80%; Lotus, 68%; and Tandem, 70%.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Those options are Apple and Genentech. <T3>Id.</T3>By June 1987, however, there had been some additional multiple listingsin OTC options for which a dominant market had not emerged. In Mentor andMicrosoft options, which began trading on the PSE and Amex in March 1987,neither exchange clearly established itself as the primary market withinthe first few months of dual trading. Volume in Microsoft was fairly evenlydivided between the exchanges until October 1987 (seven months after thestart-up of dual trading), when the PSE increased its market share to 75%,a position which it has continued to hold and increase through the presentwith no significant exceptions.\32\<NOTE/> During the first six months of trading in Mentor options,market share on average was divided approximately 55/45, with the PSE garneringthe larger volume; between September 1987 and August 1988 the PSE increasedits market share to approximately 67%.\33\<NOTE/> The trading experience in Battle Mountain Gold (``BMG'')options, listed on the CBOE and Amex since September 1987, exhibited asimilar pattern. Although the CBOE captured more than 50% of the tradingvolume in five of the first six months of trading, it did not show a marketshare greater than 65% until March 1988, seven months after the start-upof dual trading. Moreover, in February 1989, seventeen months after BMGoptions were listed, the CBOE's market share was only 60%.\34\<NOTE/> While it is too early to discern a pattern, in four otherrecently listed multiply-traded OTC options no exchange acquired a dominantmarket share within the first few weeks of trading. Indeed, in Blockbusteroptions, listed on the Amex and the CBOE since July 1988, the CBOE's marketshare averaged 59% between October and December 1988 while the Amex averaged41%.\35\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ The PSE's market share in Microsoft slipped below 75%only twice between October 1987 and August 1988. In March and April, 1988,its market share fell slightly, to 74.61% and 71.22%, respectively. BetweenDecember 1988 and April 1989, the PSE's market share averaged 90%. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ This figure represents the average monthly market shareover a twelve month period. Between December 1988 and April 1989, the PSE'smarket share in Mentor options averaged 73.2%. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Between March and June, 1988 the CBOE averaged a monthlymarket share of 65.27%. In July 1988, its market share increased to 81%;however, between December 1988 and April 1989, the CBOE's market shareaveraged 71.2%. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ From December 1988 to April 1989, however, CBOE marketshare averaged 74.7%. The other three recently listed OTC options are Micron(June 1988), Henley Group (August 1988), and Itel Corporation (October1988). Market share in Micron through August 1988 was split between thePSE, Amex and CBOE approximately 52%, 32% and 15%, respectively (3 monthaverages). Between December 1988 and April 1989, however, the PSE's marketshare averaged 65.1% while the CBOE and Amex averaged 18.9% and 16%, respectively.Market share in Itel options, listed on the CBOE and the PSE since October1988, was evenly divided (48/52%) between October and December 1988. SinceFebruary 1989, the CBOE has captured 99% of the order flow. The Commissionhas been informed that Henley group options are to be delisted in the nearfuture.In connection with this proceeding, both the PSE and CBOE submitted tothe Commission data regarding the occurrence of trade-throughs \36\<NOTE/> in multiply-traded options on OTC stocks.\37\<NOTE/> The CBOE's examination of trading in BMG options during twofive-day periods revealed a trade-through rate of approximately 19% inboth periods measured as a percentage of the total number of trades onboth exchanges. The CBOE further found that the majority of trade-throughsin both study periods were 1/6th of a point away from the quotation disseminatedby the other market (61.5% in the first period and 71.4% in the second),and 23.8% of those occurring in the second period were \1/8\th of a pointaway from the best quote. The PSE's study of trade-throughs in Microsoftoptions occurring during the week of September 8-11, 1987 estimated thatapproximately 5% of the total number of trades occurring on both exchangeswere trade-throughs.\38\<NOTE/> Applying this trade-through rate to the total number of tradesin Microsoft between March 9, 1987 (the start-up of dual trading) and December31, 1987, and making assumptions regarding average trade size (13 contracts)and average price disparity (\1/8\th point or $12.50 per contract), thePSE estimated a potential trade-through cost to investors of approximately$586,000 ($700,000 on an annualized basis) in this option class. The PSEalso found that its trade-through data indicated that large investors,<T3>i.e.,</T3> those who bought or sold a greater number of contracts pertrade, were less likely to experience the negative effect of trade-throughsthan small investors, owing to lower price discrepancies on larger trades.\39\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ A ``trade-through'' occurs when a transaction takes placein one market even though another market is contemporaneously quoting asuperior price. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See </T3>Memoranda from Eileen Smith, CBOE, to Joseph Levin, CBOE,re Battle Mountain Gold Trade-Throughs, dated January 13, 1988 and January26, 1988 (``BMG Memos'') (copies in Public File No. S7-25-87) and MultipleMarket Trade/Quote Analysis (``Microsoft Study''), Appendix B to Statementof the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. in Response to SEC Release No. 34-24613,dated January 27, 1988 (``PSE response''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ The PSE found 29 possible cases (2.5% of the total numberof trades on both exchanges) where the Amex traded through PSE quotes.The 5% figure cited in the text above reflects the PSE's assumption thatthere were an equal number of cases where the PSE traded through Amex quotes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>See </T3>PSE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 13.The Commission's Office of Economic Analysis (``OEA'') \40\<NOTE/> reviewed the trading data submitted by the PSE and CBOE andfound that both studies were over-inclusive in the number of trades theyidentified as possible trade-throughs.\41\<NOTE/> Specifically, the OEA Study found that one-half of the BMGtrade-throughs identified by the CBOE were based on quotes over one hourold, thereby making it questionable whether, given the thinly-traded natureof the option, the quotes which were traded-through continued to reflectthe market for the option at the time of the alleged trade-through. AlthoughOEA found that the PSE excluded more trade-throughs involving stale quotesthan did the CBOE, the PSE's analysis still contained a number of questionabletrade-throughs.\42\<NOTE/> Moreover, OEA estimated that, if one assumed all PSE trade-throughs<T3>were</T3> correctly identified, the cost to investors during the periodsstudied was $1.19 per contract traded through. This cost would fall to.29andCx.11; per contract if OEA's estimate of the trade-through rate wereused.\43\<NOTE/> In either case, OEA found that its estimate regarding thecost <T3>savings </T3>realized by investors as a result of narrower spreadsin Microsoft due to multiple trading ($11.25 per contract) was significantlygreater than the cost of the trade-throughs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ In 1988, DEPA and OCE were combined to form OEA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>Information Memorandum to the Commission from OEA regardingtrade-throughs in multiply-traded options, dated September 23, 1988.

Upon excluding those trades for whichOEA did not find confirming evidence of a trade-through (<T3>e.g.,</T3> excluding those trades which were not confirmed by a tradeat the quoted price in the traded-through market or a subsequently occurringtrade at a superior price), it concluded that the PSE's data could supporta finding that only 3.4% of Microsoft trades in the sample period weretrade-throughs. Applying the same standard of review to the CBOE's datadid not yield useful information in OEA's opinion largely because of thethinly-traded nature of BMG options. <T3>See id. </T3>at 4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 5. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Ruder, Chairman, SEC, dated October 16, 1987;letter from Senator John Heinz <T3>et al., </T3>Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,to David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, dated August 9, l987. Congressman Dingellrequested that the Commission consider (1) the impact of multiple tradingon the regional exchanges; (2) the costs of establishing duplicative tradingfacilities in various markets; and (3) the competitive cost of divertingresources of the U.S. securities exchanges away from foreign competitionto inter-exchange competition. Senator Heinz requested that the Commissionconsider (1) the feasibility of developing a national market system foroptions; (2) the safeguards necessary for public limit orders in a multipletrading environment; and (3) the costs and benefits of multiple tradingin the absence of market linkage facilities. <T3>See also </T3>letter from Senators Timothy E. Wirth and John Heinz,Senate Committee on Finance, to David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, dated February5, 1988, suggesting that the Commission postpone public hearings scheduledfor February 11, 1988, until such time as the Commission collected additionaldata concerning the incidence of trade-throughs in multiply-traded OTCoptions. Similar requests were made by Congressmen Dingell and Thomas J.Bliley, Jr. (<T3>see </T3>letter from John D. Dingell to David S. Ruder, dated January20, 1988; letter from Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. to David S. Ruder, dated February10, 1988). A. Commentators Opposed to Rule 19c-5 The majority of commentators, including three of the SROs that providea market for standardized options trading, urged the Commission not toadopt Rule 19c-5 at the current time.\46\<NOTE/> The chief arguments cited in opposition to the Rule are:(1) multiple trading will fragment trading interest between markets, resultingin disparate pricing, trade-throughs, and best execution problems; \47\<NOTE/> (2) multiple trading in any option is likely to be short-livedand the gains to be derived are doubtful; \48\<NOTE/> (3) multiple trading will impose additional significant costson the SROs and providers of market information, which costs will be passedon to broker-dealers and their customers; \49\<NOTE/> and (4) real and potential competition presently exists inthe market for standardized options, making it unnecessary to adopt Rule19c-5.\50\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ The three SROs that oppose the Rule are the CBOE, Phlx,and PSE. The NYSE, which became a participant in the Allocation Plan in1985, urged the Commission to defer consideration of a multiple tradingrule until such time as the exchanges, the securities industry, and theSEC had thoroughly studied the events leading up to the October 1987 marketbreak, and analyzed what impact multiple trading of key index stocks wouldhave had on the markets at that time. The NYSE endorsed the concept ofinitially ``grandfathering'' options classes already allocated to a singleexchange in the event the Commission determined to adopt Rule 19c-5. <T3>See </T3>letter to Jonathan G.

Theybelieve that, in a multiple trading environment in which order flow isdivided between market centers, there will be numerous instances wherecustomers will not receive best execution \51\<NOTE/> of their orders, thereby imposing significant costs on publicinvestors.\52\<NOTE/> They argued that each market ultimately will become lessdeep and less liquid, thereby negatively affecting the prices at whichcustomers can trade and the market making ability of floor traders. Theystated that best execution problems will be further exacerbated by theabsence of firm quotes in the options markets \53\<NOTE/> and the present inability of exchange member firms to redirectorder flow from the floor of one exchange to another in the event anothermarket quotes a superior price prior to order execution.\54\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ In this context, ``best execution'' refers to the obligationof a broker to execute a customer's order in the best market. <T3>See</T3> Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iv) of the Act [15 U.S.C. andSection; 78k-1(a)(1)(C)(iv)(1982)].See <T3>infra</T3> note 127 accompanying text for a discussion of the Commission'sexpectation that broker-dealers who route retail options orders to a singleexchange will review periodically the quality of other competing marketsto assure that their customers are receiving best execution of their orders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ As noted previously, the PSE and CBOE each submitteddata on the number of trade-throughs they observed in discrete time periodsin Microsoft and BMG options, respectively. <T3>See supra</T3> notes 36-39 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ In the past, options exchange market makers (includingspecialists) generally were not required by exchange rules to honor theirdisplayed quotes; thus, options quotes were not, technically speaking,``firm'' in the same sense that equity market makers are required, by rule,to honor their quotes. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-1 (``Quote Rule'') [17CFR 240.11Ac1-1 (1988)]. Recently, the options exchanges have undertakeninitiatives to make quotes firm for smaller orders (<T3>see infra</T3> notes 100-05 and note 137 and accompanying text.) Moreover,even if market maker quotes are not required by Commission regulation tobe firm, they cannot be fictitious and must be consistent with the maintenanceof fair and orderly markets. <T3>See also</T3> Options Market Structure, Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26871 (May 26, 1989) at notes 50-52 and accompanying text (``MarketStructure Paper'') (published elsewhere in this edition of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ One commentator predicted that broker-dealer firms couldbe open to legal liability in the event orders are inadvertently sent tothe wrong market, traded-through on another market, and ultimately notfilled, prior to a trading halt or significant news announcement. <T3>See</T3> letter from Lyn Lane, Vice President, Rauscher Pierce RefinesInc. (``RPR''), to Alice N. Rome, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated September 1, 1987 (``RPR letter''). Several commentators also expressed the opinion that multiple trading couldfoster an environment in which exchange rules regarding the priority oforder execution are easily ignored, thereby degrading the overall pricingefficiency of the market for a particular option. For example, if a crosstransaction \55\<NOTE/> could not be executed favorably on one exchange because ofthe presence of public limit orders placed with the specialist or OrderBook Official, the transaction could be effected in another market withoutregard to the existence of customer orders at the first exchange.\56\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ A cross transaction occurs when the same broker actsas agent on both sides of the trade. As a general matter, this practiceonly occurs if the broker first attempts to obtain a better price in themarket by publicly bidding above the highest bid or offering below thelowest offer. <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, CBOE Rule 6.74. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, OCA comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 47, at 5-6. In addition, in CBOE response No. 2, <T3>supra</T3> note 48, the CBOE provided data it believes demonstratesthat ``secondary'' options markets are used to facilitate crosses or toenable market makers to trade away from the primary market. For a discussionof the Commission's views toward block-trading in a multiple trading environment,see <T3>infra</T3> notes 114-18 and accompanying text.Several commentators addressed the issue of whether it is currently desirableor even feasible to design market integration facilities that would alleviatebest execution and pricing problems. The PSE stated that facilities similarto the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') \57\<NOTE/> for equity securities should be in place before multipletrading commences, but agreed that the extension of an ITS-type systemto options raises numerous problems because of the structure of the optionsmarkets and the derivative nature of the securities.\58\<NOTE/> These problems include the large number of options seriesthat would have to be included in the system, the derivative nature andvolatility of options, and the use of multiple component options strategies(<T3>e.g., </T3>spread and combination orders.) \59\<NOTE/> Further, the PSE and CBOE commented    that, if multipletrading were initiated prior to the development of market integration facilities,the exchange(s) that had become primary markets would have no incentiveto participate in the development of a system that ultimately could bringabout a loss in their market share.\60\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ ITS, developed jointly by several equity exchanges, permitsorders for the purchase and sale of multiple-traded securities to be routedamong market centers. In 1980, when the Commission asked the options exchangesto study various alternative market integration facilities, it noted thatan ITS-type system for options might be difficult to develop in the absenceof a firm quote rule for options. <T3>See </T3>Moratorium Termination Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 8, 45 FR at 21431-32. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ A similar opinion was expressed by a PSE member who commentedon the proposal. <T3>See </T3>letter from Don C. Whitaker, President, Don C. Whitaker, Inc.,to Richard Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, datedJune 22, 1987. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ <T3>See </T3>PSE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 5-9. The Phlx argued that the SEC can bringabout actual or ``real'' competition in the options markets only by (1)requiring that quotes from all competing markets be displayed; (2) thatall orders be routed to the best market; and (3) that limit orders in allmarkets receive equal protection. <T3>See </T3>Phlx response, <T3>supra </T3>note 47, at 40. The CBOE commented: ``We do not believethat systems can be created within a reasonable period of time or at reasonableexpense_if they can be created at all_that would alleviate the adverseeffects of multiple trading * * *.'' CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 26. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See </T3>PSE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 1 and CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 27. Several commentators opposed to the Rule stated that, in the event multipletrading is expanded to include options not currently multiple traded, therewill be only a short period of competition between markets, followed bythe emergence of a single, dominant market for each option.\61\<NOTE/> The commentators believe that this phenomenon will be dictatedby broker-dealer order routing practices and capabilities, whereby broker-dealer   firms pre-select the one market to which they will direct their orderflow prior to the actual start-up of multiple trading.\62\<NOTE/> They argue that, once a single market becomes dominant, thebenefits to be derived from actual competition (such as a reduction inquoted spreads) disappear and potential competitors, lacking any orderflow, have little ability thereafter to challenge the primary market.\63\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>testimony of Nicholas Giordano, President, Phlx, Transcriptof February 11, 1988, Public Hearing on the Multiple Trading of Options(corrected copy) (``Hearing Transcript'') at 40-41. Some exchange commentatorsdifferentiated between what they view as the probable effect of an expansionof multiple trading in new listings and the effect of an expansion on optionsclasses currently traded in a single market. The CBOE commented that itis unlikely that order flow in the latter category of options will shiftaway from the currently designated markets. See testimony of Alger Chapman,Chairman, CBOE, Hearing Transcript at 16-17; <T3>see also </T3>testimony of Ivers Riley, Senior Executive Vice President,Amex, Hearing Transcript at 83 (fears of so-called ``cherry-picking'' themost desirable options listings from other exchanges are ``greatly exaggerated'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ Several commentators alleged that member firm order routingdecisions are tainted by the consideration of factors unrelated to marketquality. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>CBOE letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 50, at 4-5 (alleging that in the past order flow hasbeen redirected from one exchange to another as a result of enforcementactions taken in one market against a member firm, and because of the willingnessof a specialist on a competing exchange to absorb losses that a competingmarket-maker could not) and PSE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 11 (``[w]ithout a best price execution rule,there will be a tendency to place orders with the exchange where it ismost convenient, and not necessarily the one with the best price.'') <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 12-13. The CBOE argues that, upon the emergenceof a dominant market, ``actual and potential competition cease to exist.To think that there will be potential competition from those who foughtand lost_or from those who were unable or unwilling to fight_is to ignorethe realities of the world in which such decisions are actually made.'' One commentator, the CBOE, argued that the NYSE would have an unfair competitiveadvantage in a multiple trading environment which encompassed NYSE-listedstocks.\64\<NOTE/> The CBOE believes that the NYSE's failure to dominate themarket in OTC options is irrelevant to the issue of its possible dominationin options on stocks for which it is the primary market. Moreover, theCBOE asserted that the NYSE's competitive    advantage would be greatlyincreased in the event it were permitted at some future time to engagein side-by-side trading.\65\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>See id. </T3>at 17-19. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ ``Side-by-side'' trading is generally defined as thetrading of derivative and underlying securities at the same physical location.``Dual'' market making, a related term, refers to simultaneous market makingin an option and its underlying security by the same person or firm. Presently,NYSE specialists are permitted to acquire and hold positions in listedoptions on any of their specialty stocks in their specialist trading accounts``where appropriate * * * to offset the risk of making a market in theunderlying stock.'' <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21710 (February 4, 1985),50 FR 5708, 5709. We assume that, in the context of this proceeding, theCBOE's objection is to both dual market making and side-by-side trading. Several commentators, including the three exchanges that oppose adoptionof the Rule, challenged what they perceive to be a key assumption in theCommission's formulation of Rule 19c-5_namely, that Commission adoptionof a multiple trading rule is needed as an incentive to spur exchange competition.The exchanges argued that competition already exists in numerous formsin the markets for singly-traded options, as evidenced by the presenceof competing marketmakers on each options floor; competition between exchangesin the areas of product development, execution and routing systems, andservices to members; and competition with foreign markets and U.S. commoditiesmarkets. Two commentators also argued that in proposing Rule 19c-5 theCommission appeared to be elevating the goal of competition above otherregulatory purposes, (<T3>e.g., </T3>the protection of investors and the    maintenance of fairand orderly markets), rather than weighing the benefits of increased competitionagainst its impact on these other regulatory purposes.\66\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ <T3>See </T3>CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 1-2; Phlx response, <T3>supra </T3>note 47, at 22-23.    Several commentators argued that Commission adoption of Rule 19c-5 at thecurrent time would impose burdensome costs on the options exchanges andthe securities industry at a time when they are ill-equipped to bear suchexpenses. These commentators stressed that the direct costs of the Rule,such as investments in the design and development of market integrationfacilities as well as possible loss of options revenue, could place U.S.options exchanges at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign optionsmarkets and domestic commodity markets, and could result in decreased fundingfor product development.\67\<NOTE/> The commentators further stated that these costs must beconsidered in light of the significant volume and revenue declines experiencedby the options exchanges following the October 1987 market break.\68\<NOTE/> SRO commentators also questioned whether there is presentlysufficient market making capital available to support an increase in thenumber of multiple-traded option classes.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Phlx response, <T3>supra </T3>note 47, at 49-50 and PSE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 19. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ A comparison of cumulative year-end trading volume figuresin all standardized options for the years 1987 and 1988 shows that theoptions markets have experienced a significant 35.8% decline in tradingvolume (305,130,000 contracts for 1987 versus 195,927,000 contracts for1988).The CBOE recommended that, if multiple trading were permitted, it shouldbe done on a prospective basis only.\69\<NOTE/> The CBOE asserts that there is a sufficient number of option-eligiblestocks that do not currently have options overlying them to provide anadequate basis for examining the effects of expanded multiple trading withoutjeopardizing exchange resources in a full-scale expansion to multiple trading.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ <T3>See </T3>CBOE response No. 2, <T3>supra </T3>note 48. Exchange commentators also suggested that purveyors of options information(<T3>i.e., </T3>the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') \70\<NOTE/> and the private vendors that publicly disseminate optionslast sale information and quotations) do not have the capacity to handlethe increased message traffic that might be associated with multiple trading.\71\<NOTE/> For example, if several exchanges multiply-traded most orall existing listed options, the number of displayed quotations would increasedramatically, especially with the large number of series traded in manyoptions classes. The CBOE estimated that the cost to vendors involved inupgrading their systems to meet increased demand ``could be in the rangeof $100 to $200 million * * * .'' \72\<NOTE/> In light of the vendor problems with series proliferationduring the October market break, these commentators argued that increasedoptions information from multiple trading could overload vendor systems.\73\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ OPRA is responsible for collecting from the options exchangeslast sale and quotation information for all standardized options and disseminatingthat information to private vendors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>CBOE response, supra note 48, at 19-23. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 22-23 (footnote omitted). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ For a discussion of vendor capacity issues, <T3>see </T3>Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>(February 1988), at 8-8 and 8-22. Those options information vendors who commented on the proposed rule expressedsimilar concerns. For example, the Information Industry Association (``IIA'')stated that the expansion over the past several years in options quotationand trading information has strained ``the electronic computer systemsand communications networks of financial information service vendors.''\74\<NOTE/> IIA expressed the concern that, should this expansion continueas a result of multiple trading, there could be serious operational problemsand significant increases in processing costs, which costs would be passedon to brokerage firms and the public. It indicated that measures designedto promote a more efficient information dissemination system should beconsidered prior to expanding the number of multiply-traded options.\75\<NOTE/> Another vendor commentator, Automatic Data Processing, urgedthe Commission to determine whether all market data vendors have the capacityto disseminate options data on an accurate and timely basis.\76\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See </T3>IIA letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 49, at 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ Specifically, IIA made the following three suggestions:(1) that quotation reporting be allowed to commence prior to the marketopening in order to reduce the number of price reports at the market opening;(2) that quotation reporting on inactive contracts be deferred until afterthe market opening; and (3) that use of ``auto-quote'' systems (<T3>i.e., </T3>systems that automatically generate quotations in all seriesof an option contract based on a trade report in one series) be discouraged.<T3>See id. </T3>at 4. The Commission also received a letter from Knight-RidderFinancial Information Group (``KR'') that expressed support for the IIA'sposition. <T3>See </T3>letter from Thomas J. Jordan, Chairman, KR, to Jonathan G.Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated March 7, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ <T3>See </T3>ADP letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 49, at 1-2. B. Comments in Support of Rule 19c-5 Two SROs \77\<NOTE/> and two broker-dealer firms \78\<NOTE/> commented favorably on the Commission's proposal to expandmultiple trading. The Amex suggests that the Allocation Plan has ``outlivedits usefulness'' and in fact has become detrimental to the options exchanges,their members, and public customers. The Amex commented that, under thePlan, exchanges have no incentive to delist options that are only thinlytraded and feel compelled to list new options for which they will havean exclusive franchise, regardless of the potential of a particular classto attract significant trading interest. As a result, exchange and memberfirm resources are committed to marketing and supporting products thatwould be delisted in a more competitive environment for lack of order flow.The Amex also objected to a continuation of the Allocation Plan on thegrounds that it prevents investors from realizing the savings benefitsassociated with multiple trading in the form of reduced spreads_benefitswhich the Amex believes would outweigh the possible negative impacts ofmultiple trading, at least in options classes not presently allocated toa single exchange.\79\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ <T3>See </T3>Statement of the American Stock Exchange regarding MultipleTrading of Options, dated February 1, 1988 (``Amex statement''); and IntroductoryStatement [of] John T. Wall, and Testimony of Peter B. Madoff, NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. on Multiple Trading of Options,dated February 11, 1988 (``NASD statement''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Daniel P. Tully, President and Chief OperatingOfficer, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary,SEC, dated September 10, 1987 (``Merrill Lynch letter'') and letter fromAnson M. Beard, Jr., Managing Director, Morgan Stanley, to Jonathan G.Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated February 10, 1988 (``Morgan Stanley letter'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ <T3>See </T3>Amex statement, <T3>supra </T3>note 77, at 11-12. The Amex states that the Allocation Plan should be abandoned. If, however,a wholesale expansion of multiple trading would cause problems for firmsand information vendors, the Amex suggests several means to permit a gradualor ``phased-in'' expansion of multiple trading, including an alternativewhereby multiple trading of options currently limited to trading on oneexchange would be phased-in over a period of time.\80\<NOTE/> While the Amex states that it prefers a wholesale end tothe Allocation plan, it suggests that a ``phased-in'' approach might lessenpotential problems for retail firms in terms of order routing and staffingdecisions, for vendors in terms of accommodating increased traffic in quotationand execution reporting, and for the exchanges in terms of losing dominantmarkets previously established.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>See id.</T3>The NASD \81\<NOTE/> expressed views similar to the Amex, commenting that in itsopinion multiple trading enhances market depth and liquidity without increasingtransaction costs or compromising investor protection. It cited the recentOTC options trading experience in Mentor and Microsoft options \82\<NOTE/> as evidence that the development of a primary market soonafter the institution of multiple trading is not a foregone conclusion.Further, the NASD asserts that, where primary markets have emerged, theyhave been won on the basis of market quality. The NASD postulates thatmarkets that do enjoy a dominant share of order flow ``continue to be disciplinedby the threat of future competition.'' \83\<NOTE/> Unlike the Amex, the NASD expressed a preference for an across-the-boardexpansion of  multiple trading, rather than implementation of multipletrading on a prospective basis for optionable stocks not previously allocatedto a single exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ In 1985, the NASD received Commission approval, in principle,to display quotations in standardized put and call options on NASDAQ stocksand stock indexes. Prior to commencing an options program, however, theCommission determined that the NASD would need to implement a fully automatedoptions audit trail. In addition, before NASD market makers can engagein integrated market making, the Commission determined that exchanges whichtraded both stock and options would have to be eligible to obtain unlistedtrading privileges (``UTP'') in OTC stocks and the NASD would have to implementregulatory standards and surveillance procedures to detect frontrunningabuses. <T3>See </T3>OTC Approval Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 14, 50 FR at 20315-27. As of the date of this Release,these requirements have not been fulfilled. Indeed, the NASD commenceda program to trade standardized options on certain OTC stock indexes inSeptember l985, but the program was terminated in July 1986 due to a lackof volume. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22404 (September 13, 1985),50 FR 38235. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>notes 32-33 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ NASD Statement, <T3>supra </T3>note 77, at 5. Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch express support for proposed Rule 19c-5.Morgan Stanley states that in its experience multiple trading providescustomers with improved execution possibilities, and in addition has thepotential to increase liquidity in the options market by attracting additionalsources of capital and market making talent. The firm states that the competitivebenefits of multiple trading will outweigh the costs incurred by memberfirms to develop price and quotation integration facilities, which thefirm views as a requirement for best execution of customer orders.\84\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ The firm comments that the costs of building such facilitiesshould be viewed as ``an important investment in more efficient optionsmarkets,'' and that in the long term these facilities would help maintainthe competitive posture of U.S. securities markets in a global tradingenvironment. Morgan Stanley letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 78, at 3. Merrill Lynch states that it supports Rule 19c-5 because its OTC optionscustomers have not been disadvantaged by multiple trading and the firm'sselection of primary markets. The firm notes that this position representsa departure from its position of a decade ago, when it opposed an expansionof multiple trading due largely to the fact that no order routing systemsexisted which automatically could route customer orders to the market withthe best price.\85\<NOTE/> Although such a system   still does not exist, Merrill Lynchsupports an expansion of multiple trading because of its ``favorable''experience with OTC options ``and the Commission's acceptance'' of brokeragefirm market designation practices.\86\<NOTE/> Merrill Lynch recommends, however, that, in the event multipletrading is extended to a large number of options classes, the Commissionshould consider (1) adopting standards regarding what constitutes ``public''versus ``professional'' volume (so that firms consistently have reporteddata upon which to base their order routing decisions), and (2) requiringthat all exchanges commence multiple trading in an option class on thesame day (so that firms have sufficient time and information to make routingdecisions).\87\<NOTE/> Merrill Lynch states that adoption of these measures wouldpromote fair competition between exchanges in the absence of market integrationfacilities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ <T3>See </T3>attachment to Merrill Lynch letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 78.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ Merrill Lynch letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 78, at 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ <T3>Id.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>After a careful review of the record, including all comment letters andthe testimony of all witnesses, the Commission believes adoption of a ruleto permit multiple trading of all options classes is desirable and whollyconsistent with the Act and its purposes. In order to reduce operationalconcerns raised by commentators and to provide an opportunity for the marketsto implement any market integration facilities that they believe are appropriate,the Commission   has designed the Rule to provide the exchanges with asubstantial phase-in period. The discussion below provides the rationale,justification, and authority for the Commission's decision to adopt Rule19c-5, and discusses certain modifications made to the Rule as initiallyproposed. A. Description of Rule 19c-5 and New Commission Policy on Multiple TradingRule 19c-5, as adopted, adds to the rules of national securities exchangesthat provide a trading market in standardized put or call options a prohibition,commencing on the effective date of this Rule, January 22, 1990, againstthe allocation of any new stock options class to a single exchange, andthus ends the Allocation Plan. Therefore, any stock options class firstlisted on an options exchange on or after January 22, 1990 can be multiplytraded. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission also has determinedto permit multiple trading of previously listed options on exchange listedstocks. Accordingly, beginning January 22, 1990, each options exchangewill be permitted to multiply trade at any one time up to ten additionalstock options classes overlying exchange-listed stocks that were tradingon another options exchange on or before January 22, 1990.\88\<NOTE/> In order to ease  market structure and operational concernsraised by an immediate expansion of multiple trading, however, the Commissionhas designed Rule 19c-5 to provide a phased-in expansion of multiple tradingon exchange-listed stocks. Specifically, the Rule provides that as of January22, 1990, no exchange rule can limit the exchange's ability to list anystock options class first listed on an options exchange on or after January22, 1990, because that option is listed on another options exchange. Finally,the Rule also provides that as of January 21, 1991, no options exchangecan limit by any means its ability to list any stock options class becausethat class is listed on another exchange. Under Rule 19c-5, an exchangeunilaterally could decide, as a business matter, not to multiple tradeany particular option. An exchange could not, however, reach an agreementwith one or more other exchanges to refrain from multiple trading. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ Under the Rule, any of the pre-existing options eligiblefor multiple trading, whether overlying OTC stocks or exchange-listed stocks,could be multiply traded and would not count as one of the ten additionaloptions classes. In addition, no stock option class first listed on anoptions exchange on or after January 22, 1990, would count as one of theten additional options classes. Moreover, the ten options classes chosenneed not remain static; an exchange can replace any of the ten at any time.As noted elsewhere, several commentators expressed concern that implementationof the Rule immediately following its adoption would not provide sufficienttime for the exchanges, member firms and options information processorsto make any systems modifications and listing decisions they deemed appropriateor necessary. Several commentators also stated that a wholesale expansionof multiple trading to include previous as well as future options listingswould be particularly burdensome. The Commission, however, continues tobelieve that, just as with the introduction of new options products,\89\<NOTE/> multiple trading of options on exchange-listed stocks listedafter the effective date of the Rule will not have a radical effect onexisting markets because no options exchange's financial viability is dependenton revenues from these products. In response to these concerns, Rule 19c-5,as adopted, will permit a gradual expansion of multiple trading by limitingto ten the number of existing listed options on exchange-listed securitiesthat any exchange may subject to multiple trading between January 22, 1990,and January 21, 1991.\90\<NOTE/> As discussed below, the Commission believes the phased-inimplementation schedule of Rule 19c-5 affords the options exchanges, broker-dealers,information vendors, and other market participants ample time to considerand implement necessary changes to accommodate the introduction of multipletrading of options on exchange-listed securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ For a discussion of the Commission's rationale for permittingmultiple trading of new options products, see <T3>supra</T3> notes 13-15 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ In other words, between January 22, 1990, and January21, 1991, a maximum of fifty (50) options classes previously limited totrading on a single exchange could be listed for multiple trading (assumingthe five SROs currently approved as options markets each selected theirmaximum allotment and each SRO did not duplicate the selection of anotherSRO). Under the phased-in policy, an options exchange would not be prohibitedfrom selecting the same options class for listing as selected by anotherexchange, but such a selection would count against the ten total selectionspermitted that exchange. The Commission also has designed Rule 19c-5 to address the treatment ofreplacement options during the phase-in period. Specifically, Rule 19c-5provides that an options exchange can replace any of its ten selected optionswith another option listed prior to January 22, 1990, if the option isinvoluntarily delisted as a result of a merger or failure to satisfy optionslisting standards.\91\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ Of course, any option newly listed to replace an involuntarilydelisted option will be eligible to be multiply traded without countingagainst the ten total selections permitted each exchange. Finally, in response to commentators' requests and congressional concernthat the Commission provide direction to the SROs and the securities industryregarding the design of facilities to integrate the market for standardizedoptions trading, the Commission today is releasing a staff paper describingalternative initiatives for the development of market integration systems.\92\<NOTE/> As explained in detail in that document, the Commission believesthat the technological means to achieve the goal of integration presentlyexist; the Commission also believes, however, for reasons stated below,that the development of market integration facilities prior to the expansionof multiple trading as contemplated by Rule 19c-5 is not required by theAct. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ <T3>See</T3> Market Structure Paper, <T3>supra</T3> note 53. B. Statutory Requirements As stated in the Introductory section of this Release, the Commission proposedRule 19c-5 pursuant to sections 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(C) (i) and (ii) ofthe Act \93\<NOTE/>, sections which, respectively, (1) prohibit a national securitiesexchange registered with the Commission from imposing ``any burden on competitionnot necessary or appropriate'' in furtherance of the purposes of the Act,and (2) direct the Commission to promote the ``economically efficient executionof securities transactions; [and] fair competition among brokers and dealers,[and] among exchange markets * * *.'' These sections codify a Congressionalintent that the U.S. securities markets, including options markets, befree from competitive restraints to the furthest extent possible consistentwith the other goals of the Act.\94\<NOTE/> Accordingly, in addressing the multiple trading issue, theCommission has examined carefully the evidence regarding the positive impactof exchange competition arising from multiple trading on investors, aswell as arguments regarding the potential negative effect of multiple tradingon the exchanges, their member firms, and retail customers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ Rule 19c-5 is also consistent with sections 19(c) and23(a)(2) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 78s and 78w (1982)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing andamp; Urban Affairs,<T3>Report to Accompany S. 249</T3>, S. Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1stSess. 7, 13, <T3>reprinted in </T3>1975 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 179 (``SenateReport'').Having examined this evidence, we believe the benefits to be derived froman expansion of multiple trading have been demonstrated and amply documentedby the Commission, its staff, and several of the commentators. The Commissionbegins with the premise that, under the Act, market participants shouldhave the ability to select the marketplace of their choice. Thus, the Actdisfavors the imposition of a particular market on investors via a government-sanctionedlottery, at least in situations in which there is no evidence of significantnegative impacts occurring as a result of multiple trading. This requirementconsistently has been a factor in positions taken by the commission sincethe introduction of standardized options trading. Indeed, in 1980, theCommission approved the Allocation Plan only as an interim step until structuralproblems with multiple trading could be resolved. This interim step hasbecome entrenched as the options exchanges have ceased efforts to developmarket integration facilities which would resolve these structural problems.In considering the adoption of rules such as Rule 19c-5, the Act requiresthe Commission ``to balance the perceived anticompetitive effects of theregulatory policy or decision at issue against the purposes of the ExchangeAct that would be advanced thereby and the costs of doing so.'' \95\<NOTE/> Implicit in this calculus is the Act's initial preferencefor providing investors with marketplace choice; this choice should be restricted only when it might lead to serious regulatory abuses or a marketfailure.\96\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 13-14. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ Therefore, competition is not ``paramount to the greatpurposes of the * * * Act, but the need for and effectiveness of regulatoryactions in achieving those purposes * * * have to be weighed against anydetrimental impact on competition.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 14. In examining multiple options trading, the Commission finds that the Act'sinitial preference for marketplace choice is supported strongly by thebenefits that multiple trading has and will provide to the marketplace.First, multiple trading could lead to an improvement in market making quality.The Commission staff studies found that investors could directly benefitfrom multiple trading by paying reduced transaction costs.\97\<NOTE/> The extent to which these costs can be reduced has been debatedby commentators throughout this proceeding.\98\<NOTE/> The Commission nevertheless believes that the staff studiesamply demonstrate that multiple trading provides at least significant shortterm improvements in the quality of multiple-traded options markets. Giventhe longer period of time it has taken for multiple trading battles tosettle on a dominant marketplace since these studies were conducted,\99\<NOTE/> it is likely that these benefits will prove even more significant.Further, the Commission notes that, if an exchange emerges as the dominantmarketplace for a particular option, it still could be challenged in thefuture for that option if it does not continue to provide an adequate marketfor that option. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ <T3>See </T3>DEPA Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 20, at 7; OCE Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 20, at 24. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 25-26 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 32-35 and accompanying text. Second, multiple trading has spurred the options exchanges to increasethe quality of the services they provide. In response to battles for aparticular option or to the initiation of OTC options trading generally,the exchanges have improved operational services, enhanced market makingrequirements, and provided incentives to attract order flow. For example,the PSE and the PHLX have imposed trading crowd market making requirementsto improve trading crowd performance (``ten-up requirements'')\100\<NOTE/> and the Commission has approved CBOE, PSE, and PHLX programsthat require exchange members to evaluate the quality of their exchange'smarkets. In addition, the CBOE has implemented a quasi-specialist system,involvinq a Designated Primary Market Maker (``DPMM''), to enhance marketmaking for new options.\101\<NOTE/> The system is used for all new OTC options, and is a responseto the CBOE's failure to achieve primary market status in the first roundof OTC options in 1985.\102\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ PSE rules require that, when market makers are responsiblefor the best bid and/or offer in certain specified option classes, customerorders are to be filled to a minimum depth of ten contracts by the marketmakers in the trading crowd. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23775 (November 4, 1986),51 FR 41886. The PHLX's ten-up requirement applies to all options seriestraded on the PHLX and to instances where floor traders are not quotingthe best bid or offer. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26669 (March 27, 1989),54 FR 13282. In addition, the CBOE and the Amex have filed proposed rulechanges with the Commission to impose a ten-up requirement on their floortraders on a pilot program basis. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26570 (February 24, 1989),54 FR 8857 and Release No. 26834 (May 18, 1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ Under the DPMM program, a CBOE committee appoints aDPMM to a particular option class. In addition to the normal obligationsof a floor broker and a market maker, the DPMM responsibilities include:(1) disseminating accurate market quotations; (2) honoring market quotations;(3) maintaining a regular presence at the trading post; (4) participatingin automatic execution systems, as applicable; and (5) resolving tradingdisputes, among others. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24934 (September 22, 1987),52 FR 36122. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 30-31 and accompanying text. Similarly, both the Amex and CBOE have expanded the use of their smallorder routing and execution systems as a means to compete for OTC options.When the CBOE was limited to using its Retail Automatic Execution System(``RAES'')\103\<NOTE/> for only six equity options during a pilot phase, it replaceda relatively inactive allocated option with an option on the OTC stockBattle Mountain Gold when the option was introduced on the CBOE and theAmex. The Amex immediately placed the Battle Mountain Gold option on itssmall order execution system.\104\<NOTE/> Moreover, as the CBOE expanded the use of RAES to an additional75 options, and placed new OTC options on the system, the Amex expandedits system to all multiply traded options. In addition, the PHLX has fileda proposed rule change with the Commission to adapt its automated orderrouting and confirmation system, known as ``AUTOM'', to include an automatedexecution feature for certain eligible market and marketable limit orders.\105\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ RAES automatically executes public customer market andmarketable limit orders of ten or fewer contracts against participatingmarket makers in the CBOE trading crowd at the best bid or offer reflectedin the CBOE quotation system. Subsequently, RAES has been approved forall CBOE-equity options. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25995 (August 15, 1988),53 FR 31781. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ The Amex's automatic execution system, known as Auto-Ex,executes public customer market and marketable limit orders of 20 or fewercontracts at the best bid or offer displayed at the time the order is enteredinto the system. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25996 (August 15, 1988),53 FR 31779. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ <T3>See </T3>rule filing SR-PHLX-89-03. Thus, the Commission believes that, at a minimum, multiple trading in OTCstocks has spurred the options exchanges to increase trade handling andexecution quality.\106\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that further expansion of multipletrading will continue to encourage service innovations by the options exchanges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ If an options exchange does not provide an adequatelevel of execution services, that failure could conceivably affect itsmarket share. For instance, in 1978, Merrill Lynch changed its primarymarket designation for several options classes from the CBOE to the Amexdue to ``operational difficulties'' of the CBOE. Options Study Report,<T3>supra </T3>note 7, at 836-38.The Commission has weighed the reasonably anticipated benefits againstthe possible adverse consequences of an expansion of multiple trading_namely,market fragmentation, domination by one market, and harm to the financialintegrity of particular exchanges.\107\<NOTE/> While, as described below, enhancements to the multiple tradingenvironment may be appropriate, we have determined that on balance thebenefits to be derived from an expansion under the currently existing marketstructure outweigh any reasonably anticipated costs. The experience inOTC options has provided the Commission with an opportunity to review theoperation of multiple trading, albeit on a reduced scale. The OTC optionsexperience has been largely a positive one; few of the feared problemshave surfaced while several marketplaces have been provided a meaningfulopportunity to compete for business. Given the Act's preference for marketplacechoice and the benefits which multiple trading has engendered to date,Rule 19c-5 should be adopted unless serious and far-reaching harms wouldresult. As described below, the Commission believes that the problems,if any, that would result from full scale multiple trading would be smalland manageable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ The Commission notes that the Act does not require aminimum number of options exchanges or mandate that any exchange be allowedto survive by shielding it from fair competition. 1. <T3>Market Fragmentation. </T3>Those commentators who oppose an expansionof multiple trading cited market fragmentation and its potential consequences(<T3>e.g., </T3>failure of the market to reflect all buying and sellinginterest, trade-throughs, and best execution problems) as the chief problemwith multiple trading in the absence of market integration facilities.Opinions of the commentators regarding the degree to which market fragmentationwill occur were mixed. Some commentators believe that multiple tradingin the absence of market linkages is likely to result in numerous exchangeseach listing the same option classes; others believe that a single, dominantmarket will emerge for all options trading. As noted previously, some commentatorsdifferentiated between the market fragmentation which may arise in classescurrently trading on a single exchange, and that which may occur in classesnot yet listed. Having considered the evidence before us, we believe that it is unlikelythe adoption of Rule 19c-5 will result in either a significantly largenumber of fragmented options classes or significant fragmentation withina single class. Historically, the exchange which has first establisheda market in an option generally has been successful in maintaining a majorproportion of order flow against any challenger. Accordingly, the Commissiondoes not anticipate that options markets will challenge currently existingprimary markets for a significant number of their options listings,\108\<NOTE/> nor do we believe that any competition that does arise inmultiply-traded options will, in the typical case, involve multiple competitors.Indeed, the Commission believes that it is unlikely that a new market willchallenge an existing market unless the existing exchange is providinga poor market or the competitor is prepared to provide an excellent marketand superior services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ We note that this position is in accord with the opinionof at least two options exchanges, one of which opposes Rule 19c-5. <T3>See </T3>testimony of Alger Chapman, Chairman, CBOE, Hearing Transcript,<T3>supra </T3>note 61, at 16-17 and testimony of Ivers Riley, Senior ExecutiveVice President, Amex, <T3>id. </T3>at 83. The Commission does not believe that, in those classes in which there issubstantial market fragmentation (either in the short or long run), therewill be significant negative impacts on investors. To the contrary, improvementsin market making quality should be the most significant in those classesfor which there are competitive markets. Even in those classes in whicha dominant or single market exists, the threat of potential competitioncould have a disciplining effect on market prices.\109\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ As noted, <T3>supra </T3>notes 97-106 and accompanying text, however, the Commission'sdecision to adopt Rule 19c-5 does not rest primarily on the benefit ofpotential competition on transaction prices, but rather on the other improvementsin exchange services and market quality engendered by multiple trading.Moreover, in the OTC option context, problems with ``trade throughs'' havenot, in the Commission's judgment, exceeded the benefits obtained frommultiple trading.\110\<NOTE/> While the evidence is mixed as to the number of trade-throughsthat may occur in a multiple trading environment, we find that the potentialincidence and cost of trade-throughs does not appear to approach the potentialfor cost savings from exchange competition.\111\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 40-43 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ We also note that, because by definition trade-throughsreflect prices in a fragmented market, the estimated cost of the trade-throughsidentified by the PSE and CBOE may reflect the positive pricing attributesof competing markets. As noted previously, the majority of trade-throughsidentified by the PSE and CBOE occurred between \1/16\th and \1/8\th pointaway from the best quote. Because the relative narrowness of the spreadsin these markets may be at least partly attributed to inter-exchange competition,the trade-through price may be indicative of what the broader quotationswould have been if the option were not subject to multiple trading. Further, we do not believe that the presence of competing markets willresult in significant pricing problems at the opening, inferior executionof public limit orders, or serious pricing problems resulting from theexecutions of block-size trades away from the primary market. The experiencewith multiple trading of OTC options demonstrates that the exchanges havethe ability to mitigate pricing problems at the opening. Indeed, Commissionstaff studies of multiple trading of OTC options found no evidence of pricingproblems at the opening. One of the exchanges that opposes Rule 19c-5 testifiedat the public hearing that, although initially disparate prices occurredat the opening on an average of two or three times a week in one multiple-tradedclass, within a relatively short period of time the competitor exchangedelayed its opening until the primary market had established a price.\112\<NOTE/> The Commission also notes that one large retail firm, MerrillLynch, commented that it has received very few customer complaints concerningexecutions received in multiple-traded OTC options.\113\<NOTE/> In addition, we believe that the best execution obligationsof all brokerage firms will aid in ensuring that public customers generallyreceive the best available price. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ <T3>See </T3>testimony of Charles Henry, president, CBOE, Hearing Transcript,<T3>supra </T3>note 61, at 20-23. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ <T3>See </T3>Merrill Lynch letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 78, at 2. Regarding the potential for block-sized transactions to be routed awayfrom the primary market in order to avoid public limit orders, the Commissionrecognizes that this practice could have a negative effect on the pricingefficiency of the market and on the protection of public customer limitorders placed with specialists and Order Book Officials. The Commissionis unable to conclude, however, that trading large options orders awayfrom the primary market is likely to become widespread in a multiple tradingenvironment. Although the CBOE has provided some evidence regarding thefrequency with which this practice may occur,\114\<NOTE/> its data does not suggest that more than a minimal percentageof an option's order flow consists of blocks executed away from the primaryexchange. Accordingly, while the Commission does not believe its impactwill be significant, the Commission will monitor this practice closelyas multiple trading expands.\115\<NOTE/> If this practice does prove material, the Commission believesthat the proper response would not be for the Commission to restrict multipletrading but instead for the options SROs to develop market integrationsystems which would permit system-wide protection of limit orders.\116\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ <T3>See </T3>CBOE response No. 2, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ Indeed, even assuming that a significant portion ofoptions order flow was in block-size transactions and that such orderswere executed away from the primary market, the effect on public limitorders of such executions (as the CBOE has argued in other contexts, includingthe development of RAES) would depend on whether the block transactionswere effected at prices which would otherwise trigger the execution ofeligible public limit orders on the primary market and whether those orderswere nevertheless executed. For example, in 1981, the CBOE reported thatbooked limit orders represented only 15% of its total contract volume,and booked and executed orders represented only 7% of total contract volume.<T3>See </T3>Supplementary Task Force Report, <T3>supra </T3>note 12, at 8-11.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ <T3>See </T3>Market Structure Paper, <T3>supra </T3>note 53, at notes 76-83 and accompanying text. In sum, the market fragmentation problems from OTC options have been minimal,and little evidence exists that full-scale multiple trading would increasesignificantly these problems. Rather than restrict options from multipletrading, and thereby remove the substantial benefits that such competitionprovides, the Commission believes that the exchanges should work on reducingany perceived market fragmentation problems. Rule 19c-5 will not take effectfor almost eight months, and there will be a one-year phase-in period thereafter.During this time, the options exchanges should review the desirabilityof implementing cost-effective market integration systems.\117\<NOTE/> Moreover, the phase-in period would provide ample time forthe exchanges to increase communication procedures among themselves foropenings of multiply-traded option classes and to resolve any problemsregarding the introduction of new option classes. In this connection, theCommission has today authorized the publication of a staff white paperwhich analyzes the costs and benefits of these potential initiatives. TheCommission will use the phase-in period to monitor trade-throughs, blockavoidance, and any other possible problems that may result from multipletrading, and will consult with the options exchanges should unanticipatedproblems develop. It bears repeating, however, that by adopting Rule 19c-5,the Commission has concluded that these issues do not warrant delayingmultiple trading any longer. There are sound reasons for pursuing the developmentof market integration facilities, but the Commission does not believe thatmeaningful progress on these issues will occur so long as some of the existingoptions markets who oppose multiple trading believe that the failure todevelop such facilities will further delay multiple trading. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ <T3>Id.</T3> at Part V. 2. <T3>Fair competition.</T3> Several commentators objected to Rule 19c-5on the grounds that ``fair'' competition \118\<NOTE/> between exchanges as mandated by the Act is impossible toachieve in the absence of a neutral order routing switch,\119\<NOTE/> a firm quote rule,\120\<NOTE/> and a vendor display requirement similar to that for equities.\121\<NOTE/> We do not agree.\122\<NOTE/> If ever valid, these rationales appear outdated in view ofthe competition between exchanges for OTC options over the last year. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ <T3>See</T3> Section 11(A)(a)(i)(C)(ii) [15 U.S.C. 78k1(a)(i)(c)(ii)(1982)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ The Commission envisions that a neutral order routingswitch would permit any broker or dealer to route options orders from itsoffices to any competing options exchange. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14416 (January 26, 1978),43 FR 4354, 4358 and Moratorium Termination Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 8, 45 FR at 21431. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 53 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 11Ac1-2 under the Act (``Vendor Display Rule''), [17CFR 240.11Ac1-2 (1988)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\ The Quote Rule, cited <T3>supra</T3> note 53, requires equity markets to make available to quotationvendors the highest bid and lowest offer for certain equity securitiesthat they trade. These bids and offers must be honored up to the size displayed.Although the Quote Rule is not applicable to options trading, pursuantto the OPRA plan each exchange collects and transmits to the OPRA system``bids and offers at stated prices or limits * * * sufficient in numberand timeliness to reflect the current state of the market in such security.''In addition, the Vendor Display Rule, <T3>supra</T3> note 121, provides that, in displaying quotations from theequities markets, securities information vendors must include either: (1)The best bid and best offer from among all markets (with identifiers indicatingthe market(s) reporting the best bid and offer), or (2) a montage showingquotations from all reporting markets. The Vendor Display Rule by its termsdoes not apply to quotations for options. Many vendors, however, providea montage showing the quotes of competing exchanges in each series of amultiply-traded class. It appears that most, if not all vendors, displayin some form quotation information from all markets multiply trading aparticular option class. In regard to the fairness of competition in the absence of market linkagefacilities, the Commission recognizes that brokerage firms generally doselect, prior to the commencement of multiple trading in a particular class,the market to which they will direct their retail customer order flow.Although this situation has been the norm since the advent of options trading,the factors which firms consider in selecting a primary market appear tohave increasingly emphasized market quality considerations. For example,in 1978, after reviewing trading practices in the then-existing optionsmarkets, Commission staff found that volume was the principal determinantin market selection decisions, so much so that the staff concluded that``exchanges other than the exchange designated as primary are effectivelyprecluded from competing for automatically routed customer orders.'' \123\<NOTE/> In 1985, however, with the start-up of multiple trading inOTC options, it appeared that, while volume was among the selection criteria,it was but one factor considered, and the selection factors in the aggregateemphasized market quality rather than market dominance.\124\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that the more recent multiple tradingexperiences (<T3>e.g.</T3>, in Mentor, Microsoft, BMG, and Blockbuster options) evidencea continuing effort by brokerage firms to engage in a good faith evaluationof the liquidity and general operational capabilities of each competingmarketplace, rather than simply to route all orders in all option classesto one exchange. Indeed, the fact that volume in the most recently contestedoptions has been, at least initially, evenly split between at least twomarkets indicates that firms are not automatically directing order flowin all of their OTC options to a single market. Moreover, once firms havemade an initial order routing decision, they have not locked themselvesinto that choice. Data from OTC options demonstrates that firms have switchedorder routing decisions months after the start-up of trading in an option,not just during the initial weeks of trading.\125\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\ Options Study Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 7, at 854. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Merrill Lynch letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 78, at 1- 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ For example, in Mentor options, which began tradingin March 1987 on both the PSE and the Amex, the PSE market share decreasedfrom 76.8% in April 1988 to 56.5% in July 1988, while the Amex's marketshare increased from 23.2% to 43.5% over the same period. This shift occurred17 months after Mentor options trading began. A similar market shift occurredin Microsoft options. From September 1987 to November 1987, nine monthsafter Microsoft options trading began, the PSE's market share increasedfrom 66.7% to 84.8%, while the Amex's decreased from 33.3% to 15.2%.Several commentators stated that firm order routing decisions are ``unfair''because they are based on the consideration of factors unrelated to marketquality, <T3>e.g.</T3>, enforcement efforts undertaken by a particular exchangeagainst a broker-dealer member, affiliations between a firm and particularspecialists, and ``old-boy'' networks. Similarly, the argument has beenmade that the exchanges located outside New York (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the ``regional'' exchanges) are at a distinct competitivedisadvantage in their efforts to attract order flow, possibly because ofa preference on the part of major broker-dealers for exchanges locatedin close proximity to themselves. Moreover, while the potential for considerationof   irrelevant factors will exist in an options multiple trading environment(just as it exists for equity securities), the self-interest of brokeragefirms in ensuring that their customers receive best execution and thatthe firms themselves are well serviced by the exchanges should disciplineany tendency to consider factors unrelated to market quality.\126\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Commission expects that ``those broker-dealersthat automatically route retail customer orders in a particular securityto a pre-designated market [will], at a minimum, make periodic assessmentsas to the quality of such markets.'' \127\<NOTE/> In addition, as discussed above, the recent battles overOTC options indicate that the exchanges outside of New York can obtaina primary market status in contests with the Amex.   Finally, the Commissionnotes, too, that the order routing decisions of Merrill Lynch, one of thelargest options retail firms, do not appear to reflect a prejudice eitherfor or against exchanges located outside New York.\128\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ Where it is alleged that a brokerage firm order routingdecision is influenced by exchange disciplinary proceedings against thefirm, the Commission will not hesitate to investigate and take appropriateenforcement action. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16590 (February19, 1980), 45 FR 12391, 12400 n.118 (Rule 11Acl-2 Adopting Release). TheCommission also notes that: <ITAG tagnum="28">Broker-dealers who choose to automatically route their customer ordersto a designated market should be alert for unusual market conditions inthe designated market which would require brokers to take additional measures(such as disclosure of market conditions or special handling of customerorders). Examples of such unusual market conditions would include substantialprice disparity between the designated market and other markets, extremevolatility of the market in the security, and unusual trading patterns.</ITAG><T3>Id</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15671 (March 22,1979), 44 FR 20360, 20366 (1978 Status Report on the Development of a NationalMarket System). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ <T3>See</T3> Merrill Lynch letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 78, at 1-2.A related argument, raised by the regional exchanges, is that an expansionof multiple trading will severely reduce their profitability, particularlyin light of the decrease in options trading volume since the October 1987market break, and ultimately may result in the closure of some or all ofthe regional exchanges.\129\<NOTE/> The Commission does not believe that this argument is correct.The evidence before us clearly demonstrates the capacity of the regionalexchanges to compete for, and in some instances dominate, trading in anynew option   class.\130\<NOTE/> Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, the Commissionbelieves that it is unlikely that competing markets generally will be successfulin capturing a substantial market share in options already trading on anexchange. For example, the CBOE listed an option on the Standard andamp;Poor's 100 Index (``OEX''), which has captured the large majority of indexoptions volume, and no other options exchange has been successful in shiftingaway from the CBOE a significant percentage of the OEX's volume to itsown index options. In addition, the regional exchanges have demonstratedtheir ability to be innovative in the design of new options products. Inparticular, trading on the Phlx in foreign currency options in 1988 constituted46.7% of its total contract volume and provides the exchange with a substantialadditional source of income.\131\<NOTE/> Finally, as the Commission repeatedly has cautioned, theAct does not charge it with a responsibility to ensure by regulatory fiatthe continued viability of a particular market participant.\132\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ The regional exchanges also argued that any loss ofrevenue and/or increased costs associated with the expansion of multipletrading would place them at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreignoptions exchanges. The Commission, however, believes it is highly unlikelythat foreign exchanges will be able to attract a significant amount oforder flow from U.S. options exchanges in the near future. Few optionson U.S. stocks are traded on foreign exchanges, and none has generatedany significant order flow. Moreover, in the one instance where fungibleoptions on the same underlying security have been traded contemporaneouslyin the U.S. and abroad (options on the Major Market Index, traded on theAmex and European Options Exchange), the U.S. market has captured the vastmajority of order flow. Finally, the Commission believes the enhanced competitionamong U.S. options markets resulting from the adoption of Rule 19c-5 willact as a catalyst for more efficient markets which will attract foreignoptions order flow to U.S. exchanges. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ For a trading statistics discussion, see <T3>supra</T3> notes 32-35 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ For example, the Phlx was the first exchange to developa market in foreign currency options, and successfully overcame a challengeby the CBOE for a share of that market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Moratorium Termination Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 8, 45 FR at 21430; Options Study Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 7, at 864-70. At least one commentator has argued that the NYSE, as the dominant marketfor equity securities trading, would have unfair competitive advantagesover the other options exchanges in an expanded multiple trading environment,particularly if the exchange were permitted to engage in side-by-side trading.\133\<NOTE/> The Commission does not agree. Rule 19c-5 as adopted doesnot allow the NYSE to engage in side-by-side trading in options on NYSE-listedstocks, and by no means reflects a Commission determination regarding themerits of that issue.\134\<NOTE/> In addition, the NYSE has shown no ability to dominate otheroptions exchanges in the competition for OTC-multiply-traded options. Infact, the NYSE has not become the primary market for any multiply tradedoption. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ <T3>See supra</T3> notes 64-65 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ When the NYSE was approved for options trading on individualstocks several restrictions were imposed to address concerns arising fromthe NYSE's status as the primary market for all NYSE-listed stocks. Forinstance: (1) The stock and options trading floors are physically separated(<T3>i.e.</T3>, no side-by-side trading); (2) there is no integrated marketmaking; and (3) options traders are prohibited from executing transactionsin options on individual stocks for one hour after leaving the equity floor.<T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21759 (February 14, 1985),50 FR 7250.The Commission recognizes the CBOE's concern that the NYSE would have competitiveadvantages if options overlying stocks listed on the NYSE were multiplytraded. Given the existing physical separation of the options and stocktrading floors on the NYSE, however, the Commission cannot conclude thatthe NYSE, in comparison to the other options exchanges, would be able toprovide market participants with substantially superior execution efficiencyor market information. Further,   the Commission cannot conclude that allowingthe NYSE to participate in multiple trading would be unfair because NYSEspecialists would engage in tying and other predatory practices. As westated in the Proposal Release,\135\<NOTE/> we question whether NYSE specialists would risk misusingtheir market power (for example, by providing inferior stock executionsto firms which route their options order flow to other markets) in an effortto attract volume. In the absence of any evidence that the NYSE has engagedin predatory acts since the commencement of its option program, we cannotpresume that the exchange would seek to do so in an expanded multiple tradingenvironment.\136\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ Proposal Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 52 FR 23854. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ Moreover, such a conclusion only would, perhaps, suggestthat the NYSE should not be allowed to trade multiply-listed options onstocks which are listed on the NYSE, not that the NYSE should be completelybanned from competitively trading options on non-NYSE stocks.We also do not believe that the absence of firm quote and vendor displayrules will preclude or inhibit fair competition between the exchanges.\137\<NOTE/> The Commission understands that    many vendors, includingQuotron and ADP, provide a montage for OTC options showing the quotes foreach series on competing exchanges. Other vendors permit retrieval on separatedisplays of quotation and transaction information for all markets tradinga particular class.\138\<NOTE/> Thus, accurate and complete information is available.\139\<NOTE/> Moreover, because Rule 19c-5 is drafted so as to permit onlya gradual expansion of multiple trading, the exchanges and vendors willhave sufficient time to undertake measures designed to provide the mostuseful information in quotation displays of multiply traded options.\140\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ Without exception, in the past few years each of theoptions exchanges has required that their specialists and market makersvoluntarily honor their quotes in certain options series to a minimum depthof contracts, usually ten. These requirements were imposed even in situationsin which no multiple trading of options on exchange-listed stocks was involved,and we can discern no reason why they could not be imposed in a price-competitiveenvironment. In fact, an expansion of multiple trading will provide theexchanges with additional incentive to encourage the honoring of quotes,at least to a minimum size. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>PSE Rule VI, Sections 48 and 79, and PSE Options  FloorProcedure Advice B-12; and Phlx Rule 1033(A). In addition, the Amex andthe CBOE, through the use of their automated execution systems, requiretheir specialists/floor traders to, in effect, honor the prevailing insidequote for trades up to ten contracts in certain series. <T3>See also supra </T3>notes 100-05 and accompanying text and Market StructurePaper, <T3>supra </T3>note 53, at notes 50-52 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ Quotron and ADP also provide their customers with quotationand transaction information in this format. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ The Commission also notes that it will not permit vendorsto discontinue displaying market information from any exchange about amultiply-traded option. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ The Commission notes the inconsistency of commentatorsarguing on the one hand that fair competition will be precluded or inhibitedbecause of broker-dealer order routing practices that are unresponsiveto which competing market is disseminating the best quote, and on the otherthat fair competition is unattainable because of the absence of firm quoteand vendor display rules for options.3. <T3>Dissemination of Information. </T3>There appears to be general agreementamong the commentators that measures to increase the capacity of both OPRAand private vendors should be undertaken in order to accommodate an expansionof multiple trading. What steps should be taken, however, and how muchthey will cost, remains unclear. No firm cost estimates have been submittedto the Commission (although one commentator speculated that ``[o]n an overallindustry basis, the cost will be in the range of $100 to $200 million''\141\<NOTE/>), nor has any commentator submitted evidence indicating thatsystems enhancements are, from a technological standpoint, impossible todevelop. In addition, the Commission believes that some commentators haveoverestimated the information increase that would be engendered by multipletrading. As noted previously, we believe it is unlikely that adoption ofthe Rule will result in geometric increases in either the total numberof multiple-traded options, or in the number of markets each trading thesame option class. For example, of the 449 OTC stocks eligible for optionstrading, only 103 (23%) have options overlying them, of which only 10 (9.7%)are multiply traded. Moreover, Rule 19c-5 as adopted is well suited toaccommodating the need of the exchanges and the information industry totest and determine the capacity limits of current systems, design systemimprovements, and calculate estimated costs, well in advance of any significantincrease in the number of multiply-traded classes. The exchanges and disseminatorsof options information will have approximately six months to prepare foran increase in the number of multiple listings, and this increase willbe limited, and to a large extent predictable, for the first 12 monthsfollowing the Rule's adoption. Finally, even though the Commission is sensitiveto the impact of Rule 19c-5 on the operational capacities of OPRA and privatevendors and has designed the Rule to provide these entities with ampletime to make systems enhancements well before there is any significantincrease in the number of multiply-traded options, the Commission neverthelessbelieves potential vendor capacity concerns should not dictate the resolutionof such an important market structure issue as multiple options trading.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ <T3>See </T3>CBOE response, <T3>supra </T3>note 48, at 19-23. The CBOE, however, stated that ``[i]tis difficult to estimate the cost.'' The CBOE did not detail what assumptionsit was making about the degree to which options would be multiple tradedand did not explain the basis for its ``overall industry'' cost estimate.Nevertheless, the Commission preliminarily believes that the costs to theindustry will not be this dramatic because, as discussed above, the Commissiondoes not believe there will be a high incidence of multiple trading ofcurrently outstanding options. Indeed, CBOE's estimate of potential filerecords expansion, which is based on whether ``all outstanding option classesthat are now solely listed were multiple-traded by every market,'' describesa situation which will not occur. 4. <T3>Other Issues Raised by the Commentators_</T3>a. <T3>Grandfathering: </T3>Several exchange commentators expressed a preferencefor grandfathering those options already trading on one exchange pursuantto the Allocation Plan, in the event the Commission determined to adoptRule 19c-5.\142\<NOTE/> As already mentioned, however, the vast majority of desirableoptionable stocks have been allocated to one exchange. If the Rule werenot to apply to these option classes, the benefits investors could derivefrom multiple trading would be severely circumscribed. The Commission issympathetic, however, with concerns expressed by commentators that, ifthe Rule were imposed quickly and across-the-board (<T3>i.e., </T3>to previous as well as future listings), neither the industrynor the options exchanges would have sufficient time to plan for the Rule'simplementation. In response to these concerns, the Rule as initially proposedhas been modified so as to take effect on January 22, 1990, approximatelysix months after its adoption. In addition, affected parties will havean additional year between January 22, 1990, and January 21, 1991, in whichto prepare for full implementation of the Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>NYSE letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 46, and CBOE response No. 2, <T3>supra </T3>note 48. b. <T3>Same Day Start-Up: </T3>One commentator, Merrill Lynch, suggested thatthe Commission require all exchanges that desire to trade the same optionto begin multiple trading on the same day. The Commission believes thatsuch a requirement is inconsistent with the central concept of multipletrading: That the options exchanges be free to trade any eligible optionat any time. A government-imposed uniform commencement of trading in anoption would lessen the incentive for options exchanges to list what theyjudge to be a desirable option and would be an inappropriate restrainton the business judgment of an individual exchange. The Commission, however,does believe that options markets should provide their members a noticeperiod, prior to the commencement of trading in a new options class, sufficientto permit their members to prepare operationally and to evaluate the relativemerits of any competing markets. The Commission urges the options SROsto reach agreement on such uniform notice period. c. <T3>Other Means to Enhance Multiple Trading: \143\</T3><NOTE/> Merrill Lynch also suggested that the Commission set standardsfor defining ``public'' versus ``professional'' trading volume and disseminatingthis information. If this were accomplished, broker-dealers would havea more accurate picture of how order flow is being routed to several exchangestrading an option, which would not only help them in examining their ownrouting decisions but also provide a more realistic indication of the volumeand activity in a particular option. The Commission agrees that this informationwould be useful and would enhance fair competition among exchanges. Accordingly,the Commission encourages the options exchanges to develop such a capability.More specifically, the Commission requests each of the options exchangesto submit by September 18, 1989, a report detailing the criteria appliedto distinguish ``public'' from ``professional'' orders, and an analysisof the feasibility of separately reporting public and professional tradingvolume.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ In regard to the IIA's three suggestions as to the improvementof information system dissemination prior to an expansion of multiple trading,(<T3>see supra </T3>note 75 and accompanying text), the Commission believesthat the options exchanges should consider the capacity enhancements recommendedby IIA. For the reasons discussed above, however, the Commission does notagree with the IIA that multiple trading would result in such an increasein informational processing costs that multiple trading should be deferreduntil the problems are solved. The comment by Merrill Lynch underscores the responsibility that the optionsexchanges have to ensure that their members engage in fair competitionin multiple trading contests. An important, but certainly not the only,factor in firm order-routing decisions for multiply traded options is whichexchange is attracting the majority of public order flow from other firms.This may be particularly important in the first few months of multipletrading competition until a primary market has developed. Market makersat an exchange, in order to present an appearance of activity, might betempted to engage in trading among themselves to an excessive (and oftenriskless) degree. This conduct is generally known as chumming. Such conductcould take the form of riskless or near riskless box or spread tradingamong market makers, a pattern of establishing and then reversing tradesamong a group of market makers, or merely a level of trading between marketmakers that is highly disproportionate to the usual level of market makertrading in non-dually traded options.\144\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that this type of activity wouldbe a failure of the market makers to uphold their obligations under SROrules to maintain a fair and orderly market,\145\<NOTE/> would be inconsistent with just and equitable principlesof trade,\146\<NOTE/> and would be violative of Sections 9 and 10 of the Act.\147\<NOTE/> Accordingly, in light of Rule 19c-5, the Commission emphasizesthe importance of the options exchanges maintaining adequate surveillanceprocedures to detect chumming.\148\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13433 (April 5, 1977),11 SEC Doc. 2194 (April 19, 1977) (``Chumming Release''). The Commissionrecently imposed sanctions on the CBOE for failure to prosecute properlya chumming case. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26809 (May 11, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ <T3>See </T3>Amex Rules 170 and 958; CBOE Rule 8.7; and NYSE Rules 104and 758, Phlx Rules 1014 and 1020, and PSE Rule VI, Section 79. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\146\ <T3>See </T3>Amex Rule 16, CBOE Rule 4.1, NYSE Rule 401, Phlx Rule 707,and PSE Article XI, Section 1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\147\ Sections 9 and 10 of the Act [I5 U.S.C. 78i and 78j(1982)]. <T3>See </T3>Chumming Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 144.  Accordingly, in light of the adoption of Rule19c-5, the options exchanges will have to reevaluate the adequacy of theirsurveillance procedures to detect chumming. The Commission, however, doesnot believe this will be a difficult task because the exchanges alreadyhave implemented procedures which are used to detect chumming in OTC stockoptions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\148\ The Commission urges the SROs to ensure that their listingand marketing activities also are consistent with the concept of fair competition.For example, the phase-in-period for multiple trading should provide theSROs with sufficient time to agree on procedures governing the timing andselection process for listing new options. This is particularly significantin light of the Merrill Lynch suggestion of a uniform start-up date.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion </ITAG>In consideration of the above, the Commission has determined to adopt Rule19c-5. After a careful review of the record before us, the Commission believesRule 19c-5 is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the Act, particularlySections 6, 11A, 19(c) and 23. <ITAG tagnum="85">VI.
