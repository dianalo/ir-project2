In orderto qualify for this exception, the devices must be constructed from specificchemicals known to be thermally stable in full conformance with the AmericanPyrotechnics Association, Inc. (APA) Standard 87-1, and must have satisfactorilypassed a thermal stability test performed by the manufacturer or a testinglaboratory, such as the BOE or BOM. The intended effect of this action is to expedite the DOT approval processfor the fireworks and novelties, and reduce the cost of processing applicationsfor approval and paperwork. Information collection and recordkeeping requirementscontained in andSection; 173.86 herein have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 and assigned the control number OMB No 2137-0557.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>November 24, 1989.

Schultz, TechnicalDivision, (202) 366-4545; or Jacquelyn F. Smith, Standards Division, (202)366-4488, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation, Department of Transportation,Washington, DC 20590.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On February 12, 1988, RSPA publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>under Docket HM-202, Notice 88-1 (53 FR 4348)to simplify the procedures for obtaining approval of new fireworks andnovelties for transportation. The DOT regulations presently require thatall fireworks be examined by the Bureau of Explosives (BOE) or other laboratoryacceptable to DOT for the proposed classification. The laboratory reportsmust then be submitted to DOT for approval and assignment of an EX number.In many cases, firework manufacturers have had to wait for several weeksfor their laboratory reports due to a heavy backlog of samples at the BOE.Under procedures adopted in this final rule, paperwork burdens and timedelays would be reduced, in most cases, because information required toclassify an item would be submitted directly to RSPA. Within the past five years, RSPA has classed and approved over 5,000 fireworksand novelties, a number of which were identical or similar in chemicalcomposition and construction. Requiring that these standard devices berepeatedly submitted for examination is costly and time-consuming for thefireworks industry. Based on the number of samples examined in past years,estimated savings to the fireworks industry would amount to over $133,000annually. Furthermore, such examinations offer little or no additionalsafety benefits to the public. The chemical mixtures that are involvedhave been in use for more than 50 years and their safety and stabilityare well known. A laboratory examination is still required for potentially-unstableor new compositions. RSPA believes that this procedure will provide anequivalent level of safety for classifying and approving fireworks andnovelties while significantly expediting the DOT approval process for fireworksand novelties, reducing paperwork and costs in processing applicationsfor approval, and providing clarification and better compliance of theregulations through an acceptable industry consensus standard. As discussed in the NPRM, unless otherwise required by the Director, OHMT,a person who produces a new firework or novelty device in full conformancewith APA Standard 87-1 need not submit those devices to the BOE or theBOM for examination. To obtain approval of a device, a manufacturer wouldsubmit a written application to the Director, OHMT, containing the informationoutlined in the APA Standard. This information would include a detaileddescription of the device, including shape, size, and a diagram showinglocation of all components; the chemical composition, including a listof formulas; and the results of the thermal stability test for each deviceor component. Each application would contain copies of all relevant dataand drawings required for processing the approval request. If the Director,OHMT, determines that an application contains adequate justification toclass the device for transportation, the applicant will be sent a lettercontaining the EX-number assigned to the approved device. At his discretion,the Director, OHMT, may require that a device be examined by the BOE orBOM. The NPRM also contained a proposal to require that the EX-numbersassigned to the devices be marked on the packages. In response to the NPRM, RSPA received 28 comments. Eight commenters supportedthe proposal, citing the need to simplify the approval procedures and toreduce costs. Twelve commenters were in favor of the proposal, but expressedconcern about the proposed requirement that packages of fireworks and noveltiesbe marked with the EX-number assigned to the devices. The latter commentersstated that the proposed requirement generally would not impose a burdenon manufacturers who normally pack several of the same devices, all withthe same EX-number, in one package. However, they asserted, a burden wouldbe imposed on distributors, wholesalers, and retailers who normally pack``custom'' orders containing many different devices, all with differentEX-numbers, in a package. One commenter stated that a typical order couldcontain as many as 30 different devices in one package, and the combinationof devices would vary with each order. RSPA agrees with the commentersthat, in some cases, marking the EX-number of all devices contained ina package may impose a burden on some persons. Accordingly, under thisfinal rule, when more than five different fireworks or novelty devicesare packed in the same package, the package need not be marked with morethan five EX-numbers. Although all of the applicable EX-numbers will notbe marked on the package, RSPA believes an acceptable level of hazard communicationwill be achieved. Five commenters expressed other concerns about the proposal. The BOE recommendedthat the thermal stability test be conducted by qualified. disinterestedlaboratories, not by fireworks manufacturers. The use of independent testinglaboratories was also supported by two other commenters representing afire department and an independent testing agency. Two other commenters,also representing fire departments, objected to the proposed rule on thebasis of accidents resulting from public use of common fireworks. One ofthese commenters stated that the lack of testing by recognized laboratorieswould compromise public safety and perhaps be a disservice to the Americanpeople. This same commenter questioned whether a fireworks manufacturerwould destroy or dismantle an entire lot of shells if the devices failedthe testing. RSPA shares the commenters' concern that an acceptable level of safetybe maintained. Thermal instability is the principal hazard of these devices.Based on repeated testing and many years of safe shipping experience, theformulations identified in APA Standard 87-1 for use in fireworks are knownto be thermally stable. Further, any application submitted to RSPA forapproval of fireworks and novelties must contain a detailed descriptionof the chemical composition of the device and information on the device'sthermal stability when subjected to a test of 167 anddegrees;F. for 48 hours.Therefore, all fireworks and novelty devices approved for transportationunder this rule must have passed this test. When a device contains morethan one component which may come into physical contact with another componentin the finished device, RSPA is requiring that these components be placedin contact with each other during the thermal stability test in order tofurther ensure the stability of these devices. Paragraph 8 of APA Standard87-1 places direct responsibility for providing correct thermal stabilitytest data on the person submitting an application. RSPA believes that permittingmanufacturers to perform the thermal stability testing is consistent withmany other provisions in the HMR which place responsibility for complianceon the manufacturer or the person offering a hazardous material for transportation.The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) expressed its concern thatsome fireworks would no longer be examined by the BOE and BOM, and statedthat it does not support the enhanced availability of fireworks for transportationwhen the devices' performance is unknown. The NFPA's comments fail to takeinto consideration that thermal stability testing of fireworks and noveltydevices would be conducted and certified by the manufacturer. A manufacturermay choose to have the testing performed by the BOE, BOM, or other testlaboratory. A commenter expressed concern that the prohibition in current andSection;173.100(r) on the use of plastic components in devices intended to produceaudible effects had been broadened in APA Standard 87-1 to include devicesdesigned to produce visible effects. This commenter stated that the useof soft polystyrene plastic actually increases the safety of these devices,and expressed concern that these devices would no longer meet the criteriafor class C explosives. RSPA believes this commenter misunderstood theprovisions in the APA Standard. Provision 3.6.2 in APA Standard 87-1 states:<T3>``Prohibited Components. </T3>No component of any common firework deviceor novelty may, upon functioning, project or disperse any metal, glassor brittle plastic fragments.'' Thus, APA Standard 87-1 prohibits the useof any ``brittle plastic components'' that may be projected or dispersedupon functioning. The standard contains no restrictions on the use of softplastics in the construction of common fireworks and novelty devices. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) stated that they opposed HM-202as presented. ALPA recommended that the BOE, BOM or RSPA maintain qualitycontrol over APA Standard 87-1 to ensure no changes are made to the standardwithout public notice and comment under the regulatory process system.RSPA notes that documents incorporated by reference in andSection; 171.7become an extension of the HMR themselves. The Director of the FederalRegister must approve the material being incorporated by reference and,as with any rule change, RSPA would publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>stating its intention to incorporate by referenceany new document or revision of a publication referenced in andSection; 171.7.Interested persons would be provided a opportunity to comment on the meritsof incorporating a new or changed standard. ALPA requested clarification on how the proposal on fireworks and noveltiesrelates to the requirements for a certificate of competent or appropriateauthority in U.S. variation 28 (US28) listed in the International CivilAviation Organization's Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport ofDangerous Goods by Air (ICAO Technical Instructions). US28 requires approvalof explosive articles or substances by the Director, OHMT, and this provisionwould remain unchanged. Under this final rule, the Director, OHMT, wouldstill approve all new fireworks.ALPA also expressed concern that the HMR authorize common fireworks fortransportation either by passenger aircraft or cargo aircraft, but in theICAO Technical Instructions, only ``Type D'' fireworks are authorized fortransportation on a passenger aircraft. ALPA stated that, in their opinion,shipments of fireworks should conform to the ICAO Technical Instructions.RSPA believes most common fireworks would probably fall under ICAO class1.4, which was referred to as Type D in earlier editions of the ICAO TechnicalInstructions. RSPA is addressing the classification, packaging, and transportationof explosives in general under a separate rulemaking action, Docket-181A.A notice of proposed rulemaking will be published in the near future. <ITAG tagnum="84">Review by Section </ITAG><T3>Section 171.7. </T3>APA's mailing address is added under paragraph(c)(33), and APA Standard 87-1 is incorporated by reference in paragraph(d)(29).<T3>Section 171.8 </T3>A definition of ``EX number'' is added. The EX numberis assigned by the Director, OHMT, and used to provide better identificationof explosives. <T3>Section 173.86. </T3>Paragraph (b) is revised for clarity and for consistencywith other changes made in andSection; 173.86. The latest edition of theExplosives Hazard Classification Procedures contained in DOD TB 700-2 isreferenced in paragraph (b). A new paragraph (j) is added which provides an exception from the requirementfor an examination by the BOE or BOM for certain fireworks or noveltiesproduced in conformance with APA Standard 87-1. For a device containingchemicals not addressed by APA Standard 87-1, the applicant must submita report of examination by the BOE or BOM for each component containedwithin the device as presently required by andSection; 173.86(b). When offeredfor transportation, packages containing fireworks or novelty devices mustbe marked with the EX-number assigned to each device in the package, however,when more than five different types of fireworks or novelties are packedin the same package, the package is required to be marked with at leastfive EX-numbers. <T3>Sections 173.88 and 173.100. </T3>The definitions of Class B specialfireworks in andSection; 173.88(d) and of Class C common fireworks in andSection;173.100(r) are retained for the convenience of users of the HMR, as suggestedby a commenter. Paragraphs (t) and (x) of andSection; 173.100 containingdefinitions of certain Class C novelties are removed and reserved. Paragraph(u), in andSection; 173.100, is amended by removing the reference to a ``toysmoke device'' which is a novelty covered in the new standard. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Notices </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 RSPA has determined that this final rule (1) is not ``major'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291; (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT's regulatory policiesand procedures (44 FR 11034); (3) will not affect not-for-profit enterprisesor small governmental jurisdictions; and (4) does not require an environmentalimpact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>). A regulatory evaluation is available for review in thedocket. Impact on Small BusinessesThis regulation should result in a minor economic benefit to some smallentities that are fireworks manufacturers, however, some retailers anddistributors may experience minimal added costs. I certify that this regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12612 I have reviewed this regulation in accordance with Executive Order 12612(``Federalism'') and have determined it has no substantial direct effecton the States, on the Federal-State relationship or the distribution ofpower and responsibilities among levels of government. Thus, this regulationcontains no policies that have Federalism implications, as defined in ExecutiveOrder 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection burden remains the same.
