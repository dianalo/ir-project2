When Alan Hasselwander answered the call to be RochesterTel's chairman in 1987, he didn't hear enough phones ringingin northern New York, a slow-growth region. So while most ofthe industry held the line, Mr. Hasselwander and his gang ofRochester natives gobbled up more than a score ofsubsidiaries, from Alabama to North Dakota.</LP><TEXT>   The 56-year-old Mr. Hasselwander, who started withRochester Tel as a plant manager 33 years ago, was anxious tobreak out of his home town. &quot;We looked around at theRochester area, and we saw a flat existence,&quot; he said. &quot;Welooked for opportunities.&quot;   They uncovered opportunities where others never looked,spending some $335.5 million since March 1987 for rural phonecompanies in the Midwest and Southeast. These include UrbanTelephone Co. in Clintonville, Wis., a third-generationfamily-owned company serving the Menominee IndianReservation, and tiny Sandamp;A Telephone Co., with 800 lines 30miles southwest of Topeka, Kan. The subsidiaries are small(between 1,000 and 22,000 lines) and virtually immune toregulation, with lots of room for growth.   Tired of dwelling in the industry's shadows, the RochesterTel management, a hungry, close-knit group of companyveterans, was intent on proving it could play in the majorleagues. At times they struck out.   The company leaped headlong into fiber optics, building acable between Rochester and Chicago, only to find it couldn'tget enough people to use it. Rochester Tel also had toretreat from a telephone supplies business.   The company has had better luck with its buying binge,which has built its phone business revenue to a projected$414 million this year from $322 million in 1986. Net incomealso climbed to $72.1 million in 1989 from $39.9 million in1984. Subsidiaries will control 34% of its 688,000 phonelines this year. In 1985, the company had 467,000 lines.   While it has acquired most companies with stock swaps,some recent sellers have demanded cash. This pushed RochesterTel's debt ratio over 50%, prompting a lower bond rating.Executives say they don't plan any more debt deals. Besides,they contend, the phone business promises steady earnings.   &quot;They're in the most stable, leverageable business in theuniverse,&quot; said Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s Edward M. Greenberg.Added PaineWebber Inc.'s Jack Grubman, &quot;They understand theworld is changing, so they're pro-active, not reactive. It'sa shame they're not bigger, with more resources. This wholeindustry would be a lot more interesting.&quot;   In an eat-or-be-eaten industry, Rochester Tel hopes todevour more small rural phone companies before competitorsget the same idea. It plans to pick up some 40,000 or 50,000lines a year. At that rate it will soon overtake CincinnatiBell Inc., which had 781,000 lines at the end of 1989.   But competition has been increasing for the 1,400remaining companies, only 400 of which Rochester deems largeenough to be worth buying. (Lightly populated Iowa, forexample, has 144 companies.) The price per access line hasjumped to $2,200 from $1,500 in the last two years. MarioGabelli, who with a 7% interest is Rochester Tel's largestshareholder, said it matters less what the company buys, onlythat it buys while it can: &quot;They'll have the opportunity totrade {the subsidiaries} down the road or just keep them asgood businesses.&quot;   The out-of-state expansion will free Rochester Tel fromits captivity under New York state regulations. It also makesthe company more difficult to be acquired, leading some tosee Rochester Tel's expansion as a takeover defense. Thecompany denies this motive.   Still, General Telephone Co.'s recent merger withContinental Telecom Inc., which will result in the largestlocal phone company in the U.S. with 17.7 million accesslines, stirred speculation that Rochester Tel might be anacquisition target, as the stock rose three points in oneday. But Nynex Corp., a likely buyer because it surroundsRochester Tel's territory, said it isn't in a buying mood.   Bell Atlantic Corp., with 17 million access lines at theend of last year, was the largest local telephone companybefore the GTE-Contel merger two weeks ago. The next largestcompany after Rochester Tel is Century Telephone Co. ofLouisiana, with 296,000 access lines. Rochester Tel was the16th-largest at the end of last year.   Rochester Tel is one of only three metropolitan-areaindependents in the U.S. that escaped the Bell companies'consolidation over the years. Executives trace thishistorical anomaly to a deal the company made with rival NewYork Telephone early in the century that surrendered Buffalobut kept Rochester independent.   The acquisitions might also counteract slow business athome, where the phone division finds annual growth below 2%.And the company's telecommunications units -- long-distanceservice RCI, interoffice service Rotelcom, and a cellularunit -- have posted lower-than-expected returns. But thecompany likes the notion of providing one-stop shopping, andit sees future growth in its cellular and long-distanceefforts. &quot;We're not ready to throw the towel in,&quot; said FredPestorius, chief financial officer.   Competitors and partners say they respect Rochester'sstraight-talking, aggressive style. &quot;They don't waste a lotof time,&quot; said John Pigott, president of Anixter Bros. Inc.,a telephone supplies company in a joint venture withRochester Tel. &quot;At big companies, everyone agrees, butnothing happens,&quot; he said. &quot;That doesn't happen with them.&quot;   But while the company rings up respect in the industry,Wall Street hasn't returned the call. Analysts say the stockis underfollowed and undervalued. In composite tradingyesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Rochester Telclosed at $32, unchanged.   The company sticks to what it knows, avoiding purchasesoverseas or in unfamiliar industries. &quot;We're not going to goout and buy a savings and loan,&quot; said Vice President JohnPurcell, who heads the acquisitions.   But even in its industry Rochester Tel may have troublemanaging its new size. &quot;I think you get some real problemswhen you have a lot of extensions all over the place,&quot; saidJim Geist, chairman of Lincoln Telecommunications Co.,Lincoln, Neb., the nation's 14th-largest phone company.   Rochester Tel now must coordinate operations and deal withregulators in nine states. But Kristin Jenks, director ofinvestor relations, said the company isn't worried aboutservice consistency. &quot;If we were selling Hershey kisses, itwould make a difference.&quot;   Rochester Tel prefers to let the subsidiaries runthemselves with previous management. &quot;That's the reason weselected them,&quot; said Gary Crum, president of the newlypurchased Schuyler Telephone Co., Rushville, Ill.   Mr. Purcell believes home rule for the subsidiaries iscrucial. &quot;There's a lot of talk about getting close to thecustomer,&quot; he said, &quot;but nobody gets closer to a customerthan the man or woman who runs a small company in a town of2,000 people.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
