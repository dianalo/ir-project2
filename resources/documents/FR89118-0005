L. No. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097 (1983),as amended by the Tandem Truck Safety Act of 1984 (TTSA), Pub. L. No. 96-554,98 Stat. 2829 (1984), 42 U.S.C. 2311 and 2316. The STAA provides ``exemption''procedures whereby FHWA (by delegation from the Secretary of Transportation)may permit States to restrict truck use of Interstate highways.The FHWA has concluded, after careful consideration of the law and recentcourt decisions, that the STAA prohibition on restrictions applies to allState bans which would directly impact STAA-authorized vehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In July 1986, the Secretary of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, inhis capacity as Commissioner of Highways, ordered the prohibition of certaintruck operations on the northbound lanes of I-75/71 and I-471 for safetypurposes; this was later confirmed by Kentucky administrative regulation.The prohibition applied from I-275 northerly to the Ohio State line atthe Ohio River on the south side of the city of Cincinnati. Specifically,the prohibition applied to northbound trucks with semitrailers which donot have destinations within the perimeter of I-275 or within a two-milearc along the north side of I-275 in Ohio between U.S. 27 and U.S. 22.On July 17, 1987, the FHWA notified the Governor of Kentucky that the STAApreempts truck restrictions of the type imposed, without Federal approvalby the Secretary of Transportation. The State submitted an applicationfor approval to continue the ban on both routes on September 9, 1987, additionalinformation regarding prior consultations with the States of Ohio and Indianaon October 19, 1987, and additional accident data on December 14, 1987.The FHWA may not approve the State's application unless FHWA determinesthat the segments of Interstate highways involved are not capable of safelyaccommodating the motor vehicles (trucks) described in the STAA.The State of Kentucky has completed major operational improvements forI-75/71 and has programmed a major reconstruction project for a portionof the route. The State estimates that the improvements to reduce the verticalgrades and horizontal curvature in the so-called ``cut-in-the-hill'' sectionof I-75/71 should be completed sometime in 1992.On May 25, 1988, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (53 FR 18858) that described FHWA's preliminaryevaluation of the Kentucky request, noted FHWA's denial of restrictionson I-471, discussed FHWA's proposed approval of temporary restrictionson I-75/71, and requested public comment. Pursuant to FHWA's direction,Kentucky has removed the truck restrictions on I-471.The FHWA received twenty-six (26) comments, primarily from Northern Kentuckycitizens, local governments and local officials, in response to the NPRM.Of the twenty-six (26) comments received, twenty-one (21) supported therestrictions, one (1) did not oppose the restrictions, two (2) opposedthe restrictions and two (2) requested continuation of restrictions ofI-471.The two comments that opposed the restrictions were from private citizens.One opposition commenter suggested the main problem on I-75/71 had beenthe merging of traffic from three northbound lanes to two lanes at theOhio River crossing. The commenter noted that this problem had been correctedby a recently completed construction project which provided three northboundlanes across the river. He stated that the I-471 left lane exit from eastboundI-275 could be a much greater hazard than allowing through trucks on I-75/71.The other opposition commenter offered no specific reason for opposition.The American Trucking Associations, Inc., commented that it is generallyopposed to operating restrictions on trucks, but is not opposed in thiscase because of the unique circumstances pertaining to I-75/71 in Kentucky.None of the comments received in response to the NPRM offered any safetydata or analysis nor raised any issues that had not already been consideredin developing the NPRM. Therefore a detailed discussion of comments inresponse to the NPRM would not add to the discussion in the NPRM.In addition to the comments received in direct response to the NPRM, thedocket also contained 26 comments relating to the Kentucky petition receivedprior to the publication of the NPRM. Of these earlier comments, 4 opposedboth I-75/71 and I-471 restrictions, 21 requested continuation of the I-471restrictions, and 1 pressed for immediate removal of I-471 restrictions.All comments received prior to the publication were evaluated in developingthe proposal published in the NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Safety Determination</ITAG>The FHWA has evaluated the accident data, highway geometrics, and trafficdata supplied by the State, as well as the March 7, 1987, ``InterstateTruck Diversion Study'' conducted by the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana RegionalCouncil of Governments, the metropolitan planning organization for theCincinnati area.Based on a careful review of the data and consideration of the commentsreceived from interested parties, the FHWA concludes again that Kentucky'soriginal restrictions have contributed to the significant accident reductionson Kentucky I-75/71, have had minimal effect on Kentucky I-471, and havenot significantly affected alternate routes. The FHWA also concludes thatI-75/71 will be fully capable of safely accommodating STAA vehicles uponcompletion of the programmed reconstruction described above.The FHWA therefore reaffirms its denial of Kentucky's request for restrictionson I-471 and approves through the year 1992 the State's request for restrictionson I-75/71 to enable completion of the major regarding and realignmentproject programmed for the section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking and has determinedthat it is not a major rulemaking action within the meaning of E.O. 12291and not a significant rulemaking under the regulatory policies and proceduresof the Department of Transportation (DOT). These determinations by theagency are based on the nature of the rulemaking. The FHWA has determinedthat this rulemaking technically amends the June 5, 1984, final rule byallowing restrictions on the use of certain highway segments in accordancewith statutory provisions. The impacts of the change addressed in thisrulemaking do not significantly alter the impacts fully considered in theoriginal impact statement accompanying the June 5 rule. The segment affectedrepresents a very small portion of the National Network and has a negligibleimpact of the prior system. Thus, no revised regulatory evaluation is needed.For the same reasons, and under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, FHWA hereby certifies that this action does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>The FHWA has considered the ``federalism'' implications involved and hasgoverned its actions and this final rule in accordance with the principlesand policymaking criteria of E.O. 12612. Federalism, of October 26, 1987.The Final rule is in response to an application by the State. Final determinationto grant the application under the relief provisions established by theTTSA amendments diminishes the impact of previous preemptive actions mandatedby the STAA.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
