This will involve about 2,000 manufacturing facilities a year, which undergo the routine record inspections, officials of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration told reporters.    Currently, agency inspectors study factory logs of worker injuries and illnesses in industries known to have a high level of hazardous conditions. But the inspectors will make a follow-up check on plant conditions only when they detect a possible health or safety problem during the records check, and after consulting with their regional OSHA office.    Under the new policy, which takes effect Monday, inspectors will be authorized to do a &quot;walk-through&quot; inspection after studying factory records, even when those records show a low rate of injuries or illnesses, said OSHA chief John Pendergrass.    Lower recorded rates of injury and illness indicate good safety and health practices &quot;in the vast majority of cases,&quot; Mr. Pendergrass said. &quot;But we want to make sure that plants with dangerous working conditions do not slip through the cracks&quot; just because their records show few health or safety problems.    OSHA officials said that in recent years, there have been a few instances in which plant records showed low injury and illness rates, but safety or health problems were discovered anyway.    Mr. Pendergrass said the idea of requiring follow-up checks at plant safety and health conditions has been &quot;evolving&quot; at OSHA. In responding to questions, he said the new policy wasn't spurred by Senate Labor Committee plans to hold &quot;oversight&quot; hearings on OSHA, nor by any criticism that the agency was putting too much emphasis on employer record-keeping violations and too little emphasis on substantive safety and health violations.    OSHA insists that unless it spurs companies to keep good records, employers and OSHA both lack adequate information to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. Furthermore, the agency notes said it makes far more inspections -- about 60,000 a year -- for things other than records.    These include random inspections at about 10% of U.S. plants a year, mostly in high-hazard industries; similar programmed inspections of construction sites, based on the level of construction activity; inspections generated by worker complaints or by accident or fatality investigations; and inspections for compliance with OSHA rules requiring employers to inform workers who are potentially exposed to high levels of toxic chemicals. </TEXT></DOC>
