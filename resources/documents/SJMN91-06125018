This is snuggling in style -- a wayto obtain casual chic that looks &quot;undecorated&quot; but tastefully put together.Suddenly, people have mustered the courage to be cozy.;    Mario Buatta, theNew York City designer who made a reputation on the expensive but comfy lookof down-cushioned sofas and collection-filled rooms, provided the inspirationfor comfort decor in the mid-1980s, long before it hit mainstream America.;   &quot;Life is rough out there,&quot; he said. &quot;People want to come home to warmth andcomfort. They are tired of cold, impersonal rooms. There is a new attention todetail -- not clutter, but personal effects that make you feel cozy.&quot;;   During the 1980s, many of us used home as a place to change our clothes on theway to the gym or the latest trendy restaurant. Home didn't have to becomfortable because we didn't spend a lot of time there. But times havechanged. Baby boomers settled down, had children, and accrued too many billsto paint the town. Then came recession, the war and a hunkering-downmentality.;    &quot;We have become more secure about our surroundings,&quot; says TomWilliams of Federal Hill Interiors in Baltimore. &quot;We have gone throughcocooning. The next legitimate step is comfort decorating. It has a lot to dowith our lifestyle. We are mature and secure. These days we want our friendsto be comfortable, not impressed. Just like we have become secure enough toserve our guests roast chicken with potatoes, our homes don't have to beflashy anymore.&quot;;    Many design firms are working with clients to achieve astylish design that doesn't shout: &quot;I hired an interior designer.&quot; Theirdefinitions of what makes a place &quot;homey&quot; may be slightly different, but theirgoals are the same: to produce an attractive room where guests and residentscan feel comfortable taking their shoes off and putting their feet up.;    Thefirst impression of a room is the furniture. Does it look comfortable or doesit shout &quot;Don't touch me&quot;? Several designers interviewed agree that theeasiest way to achieve the comfort look is to fill the room with plump,overstuffed sofas, wing chairs with footstools and plenty of pillows. Biggerfurniture always looks more comfortable. So does furniture upholstered withplaids or wool rather than a fussy fabric. But it doesn't have to be the MarioBuatta look. Comfort can come in contemporary as well as traditional styles.;   Where the furniture is placed is also important, according to AngelaCambouris of Perimeters in Overlea, Md.;    &quot;Furniture should be arranged inconversation areas for people to sit in and talk, as opposed to a roomarranged just to look good. People are beginning to realize that they don'thave to line up their furniture around the corners of a room.&quot;;    But cushyfurniture alone won't make a room cozy. One of the keys to cozy isaccessories, particularly collections -- paperweights, picture frames, glassanimals, snuff bottles -- whatever expresses the owner's personality. Aim foran eclectic rather than a matched look.;    &quot;If you do a wall of pictures, thesizes have to be varied,&quot; Williams says. &quot;You can make a table-top collectionof pictures look homey with rather ornate frames, old silver. Part of whatlooks homey is old and used. These things should look like something you havehad for a long time.&quot; Donna Foertsch of DLF Design Associates Inc. inTimonium, Md., says that an end table needs more than just a lamp and oneother item. Instead, surround the lamp with a miniature plant in a ceramic potand three to five antique boxes or paperweights.;    &quot;Designers hope to findclients who collect something,&quot; adds Cambouris of Perimeters. &quot;When you arestarting from scratch, collections can give you inspiration for a room.Oftentimes the hardest part of decorating a room is putting in the finishingtouches. Those touches have to be their personality, not mine.&quot;;    Dan Huber,of Huber Design Associates in Baltimore, likes to mix a client's existingpossessions with his new design plans. This may mean taking a chair that lookslike a white elephant and giving it a new life with new upholstery, or merelyarranging a collection in a new way.;    &quot;Often they have things that havebeen handed down to them or things that have been stored in the attic thatthey haven't looked at for 10 years. They have no idea what to do with them. Aprofessional eye can look at these old things differently and bring them intothe new environment. We want to surround the client with things that have beenmeaningful to them in their lives.&quot;;    That's exactly what he did when aclient insisted that the club chair and large ottoman he purchased in the1970s had to become part of the redesign. New upholstery made the chair fit inand the client comfortable.;    Books are another room warmer -- whether theyare in bookshelves or in neat piles on a coffee table or on the floor next toa chair. Mix collectibles in with them. Arrange some books on their side.Don't buy those uniform book-of-the-month collector's sets. You don't want thelook of a law library.;    Ever wonder why a room feels cozier with afireplace or with some beautiful architectural moldings, compared to a simplebox room in a modern home? For one thing, architectural elements are areminder of European elegance and simpler times.;    Comfort may meandifferent things to different people, but it all boils down to a feeling thatthe room evokes.;    &quot;You have to feel you can touch anything or sit down onanything,&quot; Williams of Federal Hill Interiors says. &quot;It's as if the room weredesigned to be used. It's a reflection of the people. People dictate thefeeling of a home. If they are secure enough, they can express theirpersonality.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHARLYNE VARKONYI, Baltimore Sun  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910504  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,061  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 4, 199100125018,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
