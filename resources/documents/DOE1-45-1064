A Nike-Tomahawkand two Sonda III rockets. The Nike-Tomahawk carried a sulfur hexafluoride(SF{sub 6}) payload. One of the Sonda III rockets carried a payload thatconsisted of an SF{sub 6} canister and a samarium/strontium thermitecanister. The remaining Sonda III carried a payload that consisted ofa trifluorobromo methane (CF{sub 3}Br) canister and a samarium thermitecanister. The rockets were launched from Wallops Island Launch Facility,Virginia in November of 1984. Project PIIE and Polar Arcs, a programto investigate polar ionospheric irregularities, involved the launchof a Nike-Black Brant rocket which housed one samarium thermite canisterand six barium canisters. An attempted launch of the payload was returnedin March of 1985, however, launch criteria could not be met and the payloadwas returned to FRC for storage and refurbishment for launch in 1987.The rocket was launched successfully from Sondrestrom Air Base, Greenlandin March of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
