Daniel Inouye asked lawmakers to take back a controversial $8 million appropriation he had backed for a private organization to build schools for North African Jews living in France.    The provision, part of the $600 billion spending bill hurriedly enacted late last year, was widely cited by critics of the congressional budget process as an example of special-interest spending.    The House is scheduled today to consider legislation that would cancel the expenditure.    The Hawaii Democrat defended the measure as &quot;humanitarian assistance to those in need,&quot; but he said the criticism it was attracting would damage the Senate. &quot;I have made an error in judgment,&quot; he said. &quot;I intend to correct that error, for I fear that I have embarrassed my colleagues.&quot;    The $8 million was earmarked for Ozar Hatorah, a New York-based group that aids Jewish refugees around the world. A member of that group's board gave $1,000 to Mr. Inouye's 1986 re-election campaign. Sen. Inouye said he was &quot;disapppointed, hurt and angered&quot; by suggestions that his support for the appropriation was linked to the campaign contribution. He also denied the provision was added secretly to the spending bill. </TEXT></DOC>
