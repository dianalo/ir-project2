The Congress' legislative arm, the Supreme Soviet, voted severalmonths ago to remove a section of the Constitution allocatingone-third of the 2,250 Congressional seats to certain socialorganizations, including the Communist Party and the YoungCommunist League, known as the Komsomol. Instead, all deputieswould have to face public election in a territorial district.   The constitutional change must be confirmed by the fullCongress, however, and that is where representatives of theorganizations fought to keep their privileged position.   If the reform wins final approval, President Mikhail S.Gorbachev would have to run in his first election campaign in 1994if he wants to retain the presidency when his current five-yearterm expires.   He would have to run only in one local district, like BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher, because the Congress elects thepresident from among its members.   Although a vote was taken on the issue Monday, many deputieswere confused, and they wound up sending the issue back tocommittee overnight. Some deputies apparently thought the 1,740 to98 decision meant social organizations would lose their seats,while other deputies thought it meant just the opposite.   The decision will affect both the national Congress and theparliaments of the republics. Most republics chose direct,territorial elections, but Byelorussia and Kazakhstan already havebegun nominations from social organizations.   Deputy Anatoly Sobchak said the system of electing deputies fromsocial organizations violated ``the most important principle ofelection rights _ the principle of one man, one vote.''   Under this system, for example, a female Communist scientistcould vote for deputies representing the Communist Party, theAcademy of Sciences, the national women's society and the districtwhere she lives.   Many deputies representing such organizations took themicrophone to argue the system should remain in place. Many claimedit was necessary to guarantee representation of invalids, the RedCross and other relief organizations. They did not mention that theprimary beneficiary of the system is the Communist Party.   An exasperated Sobchak responded, ``Don't make our country thelaughingstock of the world. I fear that if we take this decison,arguing that it will help invalids, then people will begin to callus an invalid state.''   Deputy Ilya Zaslavsky, who walks with a cane and was elected ona program of invalids' rights, argued that many organizations werenot even on the list guaranteed representation in the Congress.   Therefore, he argued, all organizations should compete for seatsin territorial-based elections.</TEXT></DOC>
