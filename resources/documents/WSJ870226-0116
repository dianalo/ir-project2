First National Bank of Johnston County, Tishomingo, Okla., acquired American National Bank, Durant, Okla. The new institution will be named First American National Bank and will have its headquarters in Tishomingo.    American National's former office in Durant will be operated as a branch. The bank had assets of $10.3 million and held deposits of $9.1 million.    The FDIC will acquire an interest in certain assets held by American National for no more than $900,000 and will pay for some of the legal expenses involved in liquidating those assets.    The FDIC acted after the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency told the agency that American National was in danger of failing. The FDIC generally limits its assistance to the buyer of a failed bank, but will approve a transaction involving banks that haven't closed if officials believe it would be less expensive. </TEXT></DOC>
