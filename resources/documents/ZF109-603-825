 The changes we have witnessed inboth the publishing and computer industries brought about by the desktopcomputing revolution have been truly amazing.andP;  In a very real sense the&quot;industry&quot; that met this year in San Jose represents a new industry entirely,one exhibiting tremendous vitality even in the midst of the unsettlingchanges taking place in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and America'seconomy.andM;Although the progress even over the past year has been impressive indeed, thecomputer publishing resolution is far from over.andP;  Just as the fledglingdemocracies of Eastern Europe are learning to cope with the ramifications of&quot;open&quot; societies, the computer publishing industry is coming to grips withthe implications of an open, heterogeneous computing environment.andP;  Both worldface grim hardships in making it all work.andP;  But the people (and end users)are convinced the end result will be world the trials in the interim.andM;Organization of our coverage.andP;  In this month's Report, we prodive an overviewtouching on all the main themes of the Conference, followed by in-depthcoverage of both the sessions and exhibits pertaining to color.andP;  In nextmonth's issue, we will pick up with coverage of other major conferencethemes: output devices and fonts, including PostScript and TrueImage;hardware and software applications for publishing, including workgroupproducts and strategies; and electronic delivery of information.andP;  Both Reportissues will contain coverage of new products relating to their respectivetopics.andM;In addition, our most recent issue of the Seybold Report on PublishingSystems (Vol.andP;  20, No.andP;  4) provides coverage of high-end publishing productsthat were shown at the Exposition.andP;  We encourage you to read all three issuesto gain a complete perspective on this year's event.andM;Desktop--still driving the industryandM;At the Seybold Seminars in March, 1989, Cal Bauer told a skeptical audienceof publishing professionals that whether they liked it or not, they had toface the fact that &quot;the publishing market is driven from the desktop.&quot;andO;Reaction was clearly mixed.andP;  Many in the audience agreed with Bauer'sposition.andP;  Others were threatened by the concept that the technicalfoundations for publishing applications are now in the hands of the &quot;computertypes.&quot;andM;A year and a half later, we doubt that Bauer's assertion would cause much ofa stir.andP;  On one side, it is clear to publishers that publishing has become acomputer application.andP;  On the other side, it is equally clear to the keycomputer vendors that publishing is a key leading-edge computer application.andO;In many cases, it is publishers who are &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; in desktopcomputing, discovering the shortcomings, oversights and limitations ofhardware and software before less-demanding users encounter them.andM;World in collission.andP;  The collision of the publishing industry and thecomputing information industry has changed both.andP;  The traditional equipmentsuppliers now base their systems on off-the-shelf hardware and, to someextent, mainstream software.andP;  Closed, turnkey systems have been virtuallyreplaced by open, modular ones.andP;  Not only at our event, but at the AmericanNewspaper Publishers Association show and elsewhere, we see large and smallpublishers using the same sets of tools to accomplish a wide range oftasks--including many that the high-end proprietary systems never reallyaddressed.andM;This is heady stuff.andP;  But no less so that the changes that the computingindustry has been through.andP;  The graphic arts industryhs influence on thecomputing industry has been clear enough, as witnessed by the attention paidby major computing companies to typography, page description languages, fontsand, in some cases, publishing-related software.andM;The computing industry has also been grappling with its transition to a moreopen world, one where it becomes harder to define the advantages of yourproduct.andP;  The change has been no less wrenching for computer companies thanit has been for graphic arts vendors.andP;  The &quot;fourth wave&quot; of typesettingtechnology is happening in the shadow of the desktop computing revolution,which is being played on a grander scale, and for far greater stakes, thanthe graphc arts market.andM;It is hard for any vendor, large or small, to forswear the attractions ofproprietary advantages.andP;  Even Microsoft, which you might think has the mostto gain from open, multiple-vendor systems, cannot break the habit ofthinking of MS-DOS and Widows as the center of the universe (&quot;an MS-DOS PC onevery desk and in every home!&quot;).andP;  This was evident in Microsoft's renewedfocus on &quot;dumb&quot; output printers driven by the same imaging model used for thePC screen display.andP;  And, especially, in the affirmation that Microsoft willadd Windows-specific extensions to its version of PostScript and theannouncement that it does not see a need to ensure compatibility with AdobePostScript Level 2, especially in the realm of color.andM;User-drive.andP;  We think Microsoft is making a mistake.andP;  When we asked how manyof the users in the Conference audience had a homogeneous (all-Mac,all-PC,all Sun, etc.) environment, only a few hands went up.andP;  When we asked how manyhad a mixed (heterogeneous) environment, most of the people in the roomraised their hands.andM;We believe that mixed systems represent the reality of the 1990s.andP;  Publishingsystems will be assembled from a constantly evolving collection of computerhardware, operating software, networking capabilities, application programsand specialized software.andP;  Few vendors chose this path willingly.andP;  As notedabove, despite their professed devotion to open systems, most vendors wouldbe happiest in a world in which they get to set the standards to their owncommercial advantage.andM;It is the users who have insisted on open systems.andP;  it is the users who wantto be able to take advantage of new technology as it emerges--regardless ofwho has developed it.andP;  It is the users who understand that they are movinginto a world in which they must be able to move information aroundelectronically, both within their own organization (where you might be ableto impose a single standard for computing) and between organizations (whereyou have no hope of being able to impose a single standard).andM;It is little wonder, then, that many of us listened with trepidation whenMicrosoft voiced its lack of concern with maintaining compatibility withAdobe's PostScript Level 2.andP;  In spite of its commitment to openness,Microsoft still finds little wrong with developing Windows-specificextensions to Post-Script for what it assumes to be a far more homogeneouscomputing environment than the world really is.andM;For its part, Apple still struggles to be the &quot;computer for the rest of us&quot;and the sole proprietor of its computing standard at the same time--andwonders why it is losing software developers to Microsoft Windows 3.0.andM;Fonts/output: Adobe stays aheadandM;Last year's event had one of the most memorable opening sessions we've seen.andO;The challenge to Adobe's dominance of the PostScript standard from theApple/Microsoft agreement on PostScript and TrueType fonts caused anexplosion that echoed throughout the year.andM;The Apple/Microsoft agreement created a dilemma for the graphic artsindustry.andP;  Prior to the agreement, the industry had a love-hate relationshipwith Adobe.andP;  It liked Adobe for helping to set a single standard for anoutput page description language and fonts.andP;  But it is hard for a monopolistto be benign.andP;  Many held a grudge against Adobe for its penchant forexpoiting its control of the standard--its stiff licensing fees, its refusalto open its Type 1 font format, its apparent arrogance in dealing withwould-be licensees.andP;  Adobe's attitude wasn't good for the industry, and itled to complaints, even bitter criticism.andM;The threat of competition posed by the Apple/Microsoft agreement did wondersfor Adobe's attitude problem.andP;  Suddenly, the firm changed in ways people hadbeen pressing it to do for years: aggressive pricing, an open Type 1 format,high-speed controllers, and a fair amount of market responsiveness.andP;  Althoughstill far from perfect, Adobe's relationship with the traphic arts market ismuch happier on both sides.andM;The endorsement of PostScript by Apple and Microsoft, Adobe's positiveresponse to the threat of competition, and the length of time it is takingMicrosoft and Apple to get TrueImage and TrueType into the market havestrengthened Adobe's position as the standard-setter for page description andoutline font formats.andP;  The market is firmly behind Adobe, and even theinternational standards community has endorsed PostScript and Type 1 asofficial standards: the Standard Page Description Language (SPDL) is based onPostScript Level 2; the shape representation portion of the ISO Font Standarddeclares Type 1 as the only official format at this time.andM;Adobe is also winning ont he display side.andP;  Adobe Type Manager (ATM) has beena great success on the Macintosh; it is now out for PCs, and it has a chanceto establish significant maret presence before Microsoft begins bundlingTrueImage with Windows.andP;  On Unix workstations, Display PostScript is quicklybecoming the preferred graphical imaging model, one that resides on top of XWindow.andP;  Digital Equipment is now bundling Display PostScript with everyUltrix and VMS workstation.andP;  IBM offers Display PostScript for less than$1,000 on the RS/6000.andP;  Next was first to bind Display PostScript into thecomputer itself; now Sun is dowing the same with News, which is based onPostScript (but not licensed from Adobe andnot based on Adobe Type 1 fonts).andO;Silicon Graphics, a former licensee of Sun's News, announced that it haslicensed Display PostScript from Adobe for use with its workstations.andP;  HP andits Apollo division are the only major Unix workstation manufacturers thathave yet to commit to PostScript as a model for driving graphic displays.andM;TrueType and TrueImage?andP;  In spite of Apple's recent rapprochement with Adobe,Apple made it clear that it is still going ahead with TrueImage and TrueType.andO;TrueType is an integral part of System 7, now promisedin the first half of1991.andP;  For its part, Microsoft stressed its commitment to both and sait thatTrueType will be bundled with the next release of Windows, 3.1, also slatedfor the first half of next year.andM;Still, TrueType will now have to prove its superiority--technically,aesthetically or both--to be taken seriously, at least by the graphic artsindustry.andP;  The users in the audience made it clear that for them, Type 1 wasthe font standard, And at best, TrueType will have to eoexist with Type 1 tosucceed.andP;  Acknowledging this fact, Apple and Microsoft indicated that System7 and Windows 3.0, respectively, will support Adobe's ATM, and both companiesassured the audience that future TrueImage printers will support both fontstandards.andM;Things are less clear-cut in TrueImage's camp.andP;  Microsoft's Cal Bauerjustified Microsoft's refusal to guarantee compatibility with future versionsof Adobe's PostScript, beginning with level 2, on the premise that microsoftcan best serve its customers by adding value in the area of enhancingTrueImage to work more effectively with the Windows GDI imaging model.andO;Although we applaud Microsoft's effort to converge the screen and outputimaging models by ensuring that the former is sufficiently rich to map wellto the latter, the potential existence of two flavors of PostScript is notnearly as attractive.andP;  The audience agreed--and let Bauer know it.andM;ColorandM;Nowhere is the transition from proprietary to open systems more difficultthan in the field of color.andP;  Yet it is very clear that we are now launched ona color revolution.andM;There are four complementary aspects to this revolution:andM;* The rapid expansion in the use of color in all kinds of print materials.andM;* The &quot;democratization&quot; or color as a much broader class of users seeksmaster color production.andM;* The transition from closed, proprietary, single-vendor, turn-key colorproduction systems to open, heterogeneous multiple-vendor systems.andM;* The redistribution of responsibilities between design, editorial andproduction individuals and organizations.andM;Not surprisingly, &quot;color&quot; and all of the issues surrounding it were among theprime preoccupations of attenders to both the conference and the exposition.andM;Color portability.andP;  The foundation for the new generation of open colorsystems is a neutral, device-independent standard (or standards) forexchanging color information between systems.andP;  The means of accomplishingthis (via one or more of the CIE color space models) has been around formorethan half a century.andP;  But it has not been until very recently thatdevice-independent color has become a burning issue.andM;As we will discuss in the color article that follows, this Conference willprobably be remembered as the one at which a consensus on a standard colorspace really began to emerge.andP;  We believe that it is clear now that theindustry is moving fairly rapidly toward support of one or more flavors of&quot;normalized&quot; or &quot;calibrated&quot; RGB (red-green-blue) color space for use in mostsytems and for data interchange.andP;  The CIELAB representation of color and a&quot;normalized&quot; or &quot;calibrated&quot; version of the traditional graphic arts practiceof specifying colors in percentages of CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black)process color inks will be widely supported for the user interface.andM;The most significant remaining question is which &quot;flavor&quot; of calibrated RGBwill be most popular: one optimized for the computer industry, or oneintroduced by Kodak, which is optimized for video images.andM;Compression.andP;  One of the biggest technical barriers to widespread use ofdigitized images--and especially to widespread support for digitized colorimages--has bene the huge amount of data that must be stored and transferred.andO;Over the past year, the new JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)international standard for image compression and decompression has beenfinalized.andP;  Products based on this standard appeared for the first time atthe San Jose exhibition.andM;Seminar sessions focused on exactly what JPEG can and cannot do, where andwhen JPEG compression should be used, what the trade-offs are (there is nofree lunch), and how it will relate to the upcoming MPEG compression standardfor motion images.andM;Other issues.andP;  Every discussion that tackled issues raised by the colorrevolution was lively.andP;  These ranged from the specifics of screening imagesfor high-resolution color output to exploration of the question of how muchresponsibility for final color production the designer should assume.andM;Standards of all typesandM;Throughout the three days of the Conference, one theme was repeated again andagain: the need for standards to facilitate thee free exchange of compounddocument data, including text, graahics, monochrome and color images, voiceand video, among different computers.andM;The move to open systems has triggered a rush to adopt and definestandards--especially software standards.andP;  Standards cover everything fromnetwork protocols (e.g., the Open Systems Interconnect, or OSI, model) to theformat of content data (e.g., the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, orIGES).andP;  In between, there are a myriad of interchange standards, both defacto and formal, for exchanging text, graphics, images and pages.andM;We have already mentioned the coalescing of standards in the color area.andP;  Thesecond area receiving much attention at the conference was documentinterchange.andM;Document interchange: Editable PostScript.andP;  Adobe wants to entrenchPostScript further by positioning it as a means of document interchange.andP;  Inhis keynote address, John Warnock described the editable PostScript formatused in Illustrator 3.0 as &quot;Adobe's experiment in publication interchange.&quot;andM;Essentially, Illustrator 3.0 writes out declarative information in its nativeformat, the so-called editable PostScript.andP;  In addition, it writes out theimaging information that is used to render the document.andP;  The imaginginformation is what a standard PostScript file contains today; it enables aRIP to render the image on a chosen medium--display screen, paper,transparency or film.andM;The declarative information, which would not be used by a RIP, would enableanother software application that also reads this file format to read thefile, ignore the imaging operators and reconstruct the document.andM;The declarative information must be quite detailed to prove useful in thegraphic arts.andP;  For example, it must go far beyond the font name, size andline length to cover typographic features such as drop caps, small caps(different set widths), hung punctuation, rotated type, type set on unevenbaselines and type treated as a graphic.andP;  Illustrator has some of thesefeatures, so they are in the current specification.andP;  Others not supported bythe program are not yet included.andM;Adobe's experiment is interesting for highly graphical applications, such aspresentations or display ads.andP;  DEC, for example, announced that it will workwith Adobe to see how editable PostScript fits in with the graphics componentof the Digital Compound Document Architecture.andP;  Other vendors and users withlayout-intensive applications (color prepress advertising, newspaper displayads, etc.) may examine how well Illustrator's format would work as a nativefile format for a variety of software.andM;That does not mean that DEC is throwing out the work it has done in definingan architecture for formatted text and tables, nor does it mean that editablePostScript will &quot;solve&quot; the problem.andP;  Editable PostScript may solve some ofthe document interchange problem, but it is unlikely to solve all of it.andO;Other standards may be more appropriate for structured, or content-driven,documents, multimedia documents, time-dependent documents and so forth.andM;PIL.andP;  At the first publishing industry/computer industry &quot;summit meeting&quot;held at last year's Computer Publishing Conference, the participantsidentified several areas in which there is a desperate need for consensusstandards.andP;  One of these was a standard means of describing layout-drivenpages such as those common in newspapers, magazines, newsletters, displayadvertising and the like.andM;Several ad hoc working committees were formed at the second summit meeting atthe Seybold Seminars in March.andP;  One of these committees announced at theOctober Conference the initial results of its work: a draft PublishingInterchange Language (PIL).andM;The PIL is essentially an extension of ODA's document architecture, whichprovides a means of describing the various &quot;frames&quot; of information containedon a page.andP;  The initial iteration of PIL doesn't specify standardized meansof representing the content of a frame.andP;  It is assumed that the vendors whosupport PIL will agree to support some number of common data formats rangingfrom TIFF image files to word processor files in Microsoft RTF format toeditable PostScript.andM;At the moment, PIL is more complementary to editable PostScript than it iscompetitive.andP;  There is no reason why one or more frames in a PIL documentcould not contain editable PostScript files.andM;The PIL committee will meet again in Denver the week you receive this Report.andO;It will decide at that time whether or not to move immediately to extend thespecification to include standards for expressing the contents of frames.andP;  Ifit decides to move in this direction, PIL will indeed become more competitivewith editable PostScript than it currently is.andM;Meanwhile, there is an effort within the International Standards Organization(ISO) to address the interchange of formatting information along witheditable, content-driven documents.andP;  This effort has led to the DocumentStyle, Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL), which is now circulatingfor comments.andP;  The DSSSL standard is a way of attaching style sheets tocontent, independent of software application or hardware.andP;  It may also beviewed as a complement to SGML: it enables the development of SGMLapplications that describe both format and content.andP;  By next year, vendorsshould be able to begin developing products that make use of this standard.andM;Extending into new media.andP;  The increasing influence of the consumerelectronics world on desktop computing is introducing graphics, animation,motion images and sound to publishing.andP;  The result is more complexity.andP;  Inthe Brave New World of &quot;open systems computing,&quot; to borrow one of Sun's oldmarketing slogans, computing is clearly becoming something very differentfrom what it once was.andM;Steve Jobs underscored this point with a vengeance as he introduced to thepublishing crowd his new suite of color multimedia machines, which Jobsproposes are the first examples of a new paradigm, that of interpersonalcomputing.andM;Using electronic mail and interprocess communications as the facilitators,users in the Next computing environment can send messages with voice,formatted documents, full-motion graphics and images, spreadsheetdata--anything, in fact, that can be generated in the Next environment--toanyone else with a Next computer.andP;  Alternatively, documents can be faxeddirectly from the workstation, complete with whatever PostScript images ordata can be represented on the printed page.andM;DEC's CDA approach.andP;  The problem with Next's approach is that it--like thesimilar &quot;total computing environments&quot; from vendors such as Xerox(ViewPoint), IBM (SAA), Apple (Macintosh) and Microsoft (Windows)--presumes ahomogeneous system (all users have Next computers).andP;  To be fair, Next hasdone a better job than most in trying to use existing standards (PostScript,JPEG, etc.), and in trying to work with international standards committees tooffer the &quot;proprietary&quot; standards it has had to invent for general,industry-wide use.andM;But DEC is still the most &quot;open&quot; of all of the vendors in this arena.andP;  The&quot;enterprise-wide&quot; view of its Network Application Services and CompoundDocument Architecture provides data interchange across platforms.andP;  DEC is inthe process of putting the CDA toolkit on non-DEC platforms.andP;  Its OS/2toolkit was announced at the show, and the Mac and PC toolkits are underdevelopment.andP;  DEC's architecture includes a format for interchangingformatted compound documents that include text, graphics and monochrome orcolor images.andM;This is still a DEC-centric approach, however, and is likely to remain sounless other major vendors decide that it makes more sense for them tosupport and participate in the DEC standards than it does to go off in yetanother direction.andM;Virtually everyone agrees that the next generation of software is going tolook very different from the last.andP;  The new vision is of modular applicationsoftware building blocks that may be linked to provide a solution tailored tothe user's application needs.andP;  A text document, for example, may contain a&quot;live&quot; image, a graphic, or the results of a spreadsheet calculation.andP;  Alterthe original, and you can automatically update the &quot;view&quot; of that originalcontained in the document.andP;  Double-click on the window in the document thatcontains the image or graphic, and you open up the application program thatcreated that graphic with (providing you have proper access privileges) fullability to modify the original data.andM;Hewlett-Packard's New Wave software for the PC supports this, as do theMicrosoft DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) conventions for Windows and OS/2 andthe Apple IAC (inter-application communication) protocols promised forMacintosh System 7.0.andP;  DEC's architecture also supports both inclusive, hotlinks and referential, hypertext links.andP;  DEC proved at the show that its CDAarchitecture extends across platforms by introducing DECwrite for OS/2, withhot links to Excel and Ultrix applications.andM;Other vendors are also working on so-called &quot;interprocess communicationsstandards.&quot;andP;  Some are doing it within a homogeneous environment; for example,Apple with its links in Macintosh System 7 and Microsoft with its DynamicData Exchange in Windows 3.0.andP;  There are other efforts to do similar thingson heterogeneous platforms--for example, the named pipes of OS/2, supportedby Microsoft, Novell, Banyan, HP, DEC, IBM and others, and the recentlyannounced Microsoft/Lotus Compound Document Protocol Specification.andP;  Thesestandards, like DEC's live links, are designed so that data may be updatedautomatically in a document or a user can launch the application that createdan element of a given data type within a compound document simply bydouble-clicking on the element.andM;In his presentation titled &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; DEC's Howard Woolf likenedwhere we are today in computing to the dawn of the industrial revolution,when interchangeable parts were developed.andP;  DEC's strategy is to utilizestandards that exist--and help establish those that don't--to ensure theinterchangeability of information in a heterogeneous computing environment.andM;Despite the clear superiority of DEC's architecture, the rest of the industryhas been slow to respond to DEC's call for support.andP;  It seems that everyoneelse believes it will be easier to do it their way than to convince DEC toadopt some of their requests.andP;  Until a compromise is hashed out, we are leftwith &quot;islands of interoperability&quot; in a &quot;sea of incompatibility.&quot;andM;It's HyTime.andP;  The move into new technologies--such as sound andvideo--complicates the issue of interchange considerably.andP;  How do youdescribe an opera in a way that allows the tempo to be controlled by theconductor, or end user?andP;  How do you represent an opera digitally in a waythat is device-independent?andM;One method nearing completion is HyTime, a language developed forrepresenting music in a document.andP;  The effort is being led by CharlesGoldfarb, one of the authors of IBM's Generalized Markup Language, aprecursor to SGML.andM;HyTime stands for Hypermedia/Time-Based Structuring Language.andP;  It is beingdeveloped as a time-based document representation that will support a varietyof &quot;performances&quot;--sports broadcasts, shuttle launches, manufacturingprocesses, movies or computer-driven multimedia presentations.andP;  In additionto multiple data types and time-based events, HyTime is notable for includinghypertext referential links.andP;  It holds promise as a standard encoding forrepresenting databases of digitally recorded time-relative events.andM;We'll publish a detailed look at HyTime next year.andM;Computing environmentsandM;The reality is, of course, that as much as we would like a completely open,heterogeneous multivendor environment, it will always be easier to makethings work together when you stay within a particular computing environment.andM;This observation immediately raises a question--&quot;Which environment?&quot;--that isof paramount importance to all Conference attenders, users and softwaredevelopers alike.andP;  To a large extent, the possibilities (both in terms ofwhat your computer system is capable of doing and in terms of the range ofthird-party software available) are determined by the computing environmentyou choose.andM;On this score, the two most notable developments of the Conference were theemergence of Microsoft Windows 3.0 and the rebirth of Next.andM;Windows 3.0 has had a phenomenal impact on the industry since itsintroduction last May.andP;  Microsoft's Bill Gates announced that more than amillion copies had been shipped in the four months preceding the Conference.andO;This was the first multiple-platform computer exhibition since Windows 3.0was announced; it represented, therefore, the first occasion for attenders tosee Windows, OS/2, Macintosh and Unix systems and software side by side.andM;There was an impressive amount of new Windows publishing software--much of iteither ported from the Macintosh or close functional competitors to otherpackages that exist on the Mac.andP;  Windows and its application software are notyet as polished as their Mac equivalents, but we are now talking aboutdifferences in degree rather than differences in kind.andM;The most significant development, in our opinion, was the way thatMicrosoft's thinking about Windows has shifted.andP;  Windows is no longer thegraphic user interface for MS-DOS, an interim step on the way to the &quot;real&quot;graphic environment for the 1990s: OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  Instead,Windows is now being positioned as an operating-system-independent graphicoperating environment--the graphic environment of choice for the '90s.andM;For the moment, Windows runs on top of MS-DOS.andP;  With release 3 of the OS/2operating system, Windows will also run on top of OS/2--equal with OS/2's ownPresentation Manager graphic environment.andP;  Meanwhile, OS/2 itself will beported to run on RISC platforms as well as Intel-based PCs.andM;The clear message is that only people who desperately need the benefits ofOS/2 in the next couple of years should bother with developingOS/2-Presentation Manager software.andP;  Everyone else should concentrate onWindows software, which will run today on MS-DOS machines and tomorrow onboth MS-DOS and OS/2.andM;Next and Sun.andP;  The other &quot;new&quot; environments at this year's show were thelow-cost workstations from Next and Sun Microsystems.andP;  Next probably came theclosest of any hardware vendor to &quot;stealing the show.&quot;andP;  From Steve Jobs'sopening session demonstration of the new Next hardware and software(including everything from kerned display headlines to live,30-frame-per-second full-resolution video running concurrent with interactivecolor display PostScript) to the crowds jamming the Next booth anddemonstration areas, it was clear that this audience is intrigued by whatNext is trying to achieve.andM;The other system vendor pointing the way to the future was Sun, with itsjust-announced NewsPrint capabilities.andP;  Sun's approach is complete WYSIWYGfidelity from Sun's News (display PostScript) on the screen to output on anyhard-copy device from dot-matrix printers through &quot;dumb&quot; laser printersthrough high-resolution PostScript film recorders--precisely what users havebeen saying they wanted for the past several Conferences.andM;The final issue: peopleandM;As in each of the previous four years, the underlying issues pervading theConference--discussed in many contexts, and from many points of view--werethe human and organizational issues.andM;Who will be the integrator?andP;  This question has been asked over and over againthroughout each of the five Conferences, and each year the answerincreasingly is that you, the end user, will be the integrator.andP;  As thetraditional third-wave suppliers have struggled to transform their companiesinto fourth-wave value-added resellers and system integrators, more of theburden for tying together the disparate pieces has shifted onto the end usersand their agents, the value-added reseller/system integrators.andM;As we remove constraints imposed by proprietary technologies, we face thequestion of how we should bring the new open technologies to bear on ourbusiness.andP;  Moreover, we also must ask ourselves how we should organize thepublishing process to take best advantage of the new tools as they becomeavailable.andM;New skill-sets required.andP;  If the desktop computing revolution is viewed inthe context of a move toward an effective means of communicating, as opposedto crunching data or setting type, we can foresee the eventual convergence ofa third force, the consumer electronics industry.andM;In June, at the Digital World conference, Douglas Adams characterized theconvergence of the publishing, computing and consumer electronics industriesas &quot;the critical mass of critical masses.&quot;andP;  Anyone watching Kathy Wilson'spresentation on the &quot;Palenque&quot; project, targeted at schools and interactivelearning, or Robert Abel's &quot;Guernica&quot; can't help being aware of how works&quot;published&quot; in these interactive formats, with sound, full-motion video andother digital data, could revolutionize educational publishing or training.andM;Not only does this imply that the real revolution has yet to come, but italso signifies that the human issues will soon become even more complex.andO;There will be a necessity to master not only new graphic arts skills, such ascolor image processing, but also multimedia production skills that takeadvantage of electronic distribution media.andM;Consequently, the real message underlying the quiet earnestness of thisyear's Computer Publishing Conference was that we are still in the earlystages of an ongoing revolution, one with far greater ramifications than wefirst suspected.andM;In the future, publishers will be better positioned to leverage all that wedo, in a variety of media with a number of options.andP;  We will assemble systembuilding blocks to meet specific applicaiton needs.andP;  And we will have morechoices for distribution media: centralized printing and binding,decentralized (distributed) printing and binding, on-demand printed paper,electronic mail, CD-ROM, online subscription services.andP;  In the long run, ourjobs as integrators will be made easier by well-defined and well-supportedstandards that enable the &quot;interpersonal computing tools&quot; of one system tointeract with those of another.andM;In short, getting there won't be easy, but we believe that arriving will makethe hard journey worthwhile.andP;  In the meantime, we'll do our best to tell thestories of the trailblazers and leave signposts for those who follow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
