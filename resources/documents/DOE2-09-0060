Thethermodynamic efficiency (different from the usual practical efficiency)will be maximum, equal to the Carnot factor, when the evolution of thesystem is reversible. The reversibility conditions are met only for atwo-level system, at open circuit, with purely radiative recombination.This case is the equivalent of the ideal gas Carnot engine and yieldsthe Carnot efficiency (although the practical efficiency is zero, sincethe output power is vanishingly small). All other configurations leadto a loss in thermodynamic efficiency; the practical efficiency will,in all cases, be lower than the thermodynamic one (this discussion doesnot apply to multispectral cells). The identity of the hot reservoirtemperature with the 'effective temperature', as usually defined, canbe shown. 1 fig., 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
