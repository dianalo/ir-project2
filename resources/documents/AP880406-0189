Technicians from the Institute of Physics of the Earth under theSoviet Academy of Sciences and the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, an American environmental group, are to set off twonon-nuclear explosions to test the ability of high-frequencyseismological devices to measure underground nuclear tests.   ``We expect the experiment to produce new evidence on thecapability to verify a comprehensive or very low-yield test bantreaty,'' said Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist with theenvironmental group.   The U.S. and Soviet scientists set off three explosions insimilar tests starting in September 1986 near the Soviet nucleartest site at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.   The head of the Soviet team, Nikolai F. Yukhnin, told reportersWednesday that the test results from Kazakhstan ``were perceived asquite successful in the technical aspects.''   Considerable political obstacles remain to a nuclear test bantreaty, however.   The administration refused to join a 19-month Soviet nucleartest moratorium, which ended in February 1987. In addition, itwants the Soviets to conduct tests of a system called CORRTEX tosupplement seismological monitoring of two nuclear thresholdtreaties signed in the 1970s but never ratified by the Senate.   Official teams of scientists visited each other's test sites inNevada and Kazakhstan last winter, but no date has been set for theCORRTEX tests.   The administration says the tests, which use a cable implantedin the ground to measure yield, would be the first step in aprocess leading to ratification of the threshold treaties andperhaps to a pact banning nuclear weapons tests outright.   Until the current visit, the State Department had denied visasto Soviet scientists wishing to take part in the unofficial NaturalResources Defense Council experiments, said S. Jacob Scherr, anattorney for the group.   Yukhnin said that within the Soviet government, ``the ForeignMinistry has given full support to the experiments. I think thatthe military people were not fully supportive. But they let us setup experimental sites around the polygon,'' as the test site inKazakhstan is known.   Cochran said the Nevada tests were designed to measure nuclearblasts in the 1- to 10-kiloton range, well below the 150-kilotonlimit of the threshold treaties.   A kiloton is a force equal to 1,000 pounds of TNT. The atomicdevice exploded over Hiroshima at the close of World War II had aforce of 1.5 kilotons, or 15,000 pounds of TNT.   Unlike earlier seismological equipment, Cochran said, thehigh-frequency devices being used in Nevada may have the ability tofoil attempts to disguise the magnitude of underground nuclearblasts. Such attempts could be made by a process known as``de-coupling,'' or setting off the explosions in undergroundcaverns to make them seem smaller.   To measure the Nevada tests, the Soviet team brought over oneton of scientific devices, which Cochran described as ``some of themost sophisticated seismological equipment in the world.''   In addition to the team of nine scientists and technicians whoarrived in Washington on Tuesday and headed for Reno on Wednesday,the head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Yevgeny Velikhov, wasto arrive in the United States on April 24 to observe the tests.   One 10-ton explosion is scheduled for April 29 at Black RockDesert, 90 miles north of Reno; and another 15-ton blast at BrokenHills, 100 miles east of Reno.</TEXT></DOC>
