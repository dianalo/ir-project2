The poultry, animal by-products and milling concern attributed the slump to publicity about salmonella bacteria and to weak prices stemming from an 8% increase in chicken production.    A year earlier the company had profit of $21.3 million, or $1.31 a share.    Holly Farms, formerly Federal Co., said sales rose 16% in the latest quarter to $383.5 million due to the acquisition of three companies in December.    Lee Taylor, president and chief executive officer, said he expects poor earnings to continue in the second and third quarters, as the company spends heavily on introducing new products. In last year's second quarter, the company had net income of $21 million, or $1.28 a share, on sales of $322 million.    The company's poultry division, which includes the Holly Farms label, had an operating loss of $2.8 million, compared with operating profit of $37.7 million. Sales fell 15% to $180 million.    Mr. Taylor said that the average selling price for its fresh chicken products fell 21%. He said that while demand for chicken remained strong, the supply increase meant prices couldn't be sustained. The pricing structure also was &quot;damaged overnight,&quot; he said, by the large number of media reports about chicken contaminated with salmonella bacteria, which can cause food poisoning.    He said the division's results were also affected by costs associated with introduction of its new roast chicken product and by a 71% increase in marketing outlays.    Mr. Taylor said he expected that chicken prices will recover to &quot;more normal levels&quot; around December as producers reduce supply.    The company's food services division was aided by the three acquisitions. Income for the flour and bakery supplies division fell 15% to $5.1 million from $6 million. Sales dropped 4% to $74.9 million. Earnings in the by-products division jumped to $2 million from $371,000. </TEXT></DOC>
