The bonds, maturing July 22, 1992, are underwritten jointly by a syndicate group led by Nomura International Ltd. Dealers said the issue got a respectable, if not strong, reception.    In secondary markets, meanwhile, Eurodollar bonds closed slightly higher on the strength of the U.S. Treasury markets.    Toyota's bond offering, indicating a 1 1/4% coupon at par, came just three days after Japanese equities prices plunged, although Tokyo stocks have since recovered. The plunge hit Eurobond equity-warrant issues, which may have eased further in anticipation of an offering by Toyota. Yesterday's offering was one-third bigger than any previous issue of its kind.    Nomura reportedly bolstered demand by pre-selling as much as a third of the bonds in Japan with institutional buyers such as life insurance companies. Other investment houses involved in the launch said Nomura and its co-lead syndicators had been soliciting interest in the bonds for as long as two weeks before the actual launch.    Syndication specialists at other houses said Toyota might have saved itself as much as half a percentage point on the coupon if it had issued the bonds earlier in the month, before the Tokyo market broke. At that point, coupons on such issues appeared ready to edge down below 1%.    However, a Nomura official said that pre-launch formalities, including the amount of time required to get approval from Japanese authorities, made it impossible to accelerate the launch, even after it appeared that the markets were weakening.    Toyota said intends to use proceeds from the issue for new plant and equipment investments. In February, the company said it planned to allocate 300 billion yen ($2.08 billion) in capital spending in the 1987 fiscal year.    In other launches, Rouse Co., a U.S. developer, found demand for its $130 million of 15-year convertible Eurobonds paying 5 3/4% at par. Led by Kleinwort Benson Ltd., the issue was said to benefit from the success of another recent Eurobond issue from the firm, as well as European familiarity with some of Rouse's highly publicized urban-revitalization projects.    One of the strongest performers of the day was an issue by one of the few recent non-Japanese borrowers in an equity-warrant offering -- Nokia Corp., a Finnish industrial concern. The company yesterday reported that its pre-tax profit doubled in the first four months of the year. That helped boost its $100 million of bonds, paying 5% at par. The lead manager was Morgan Guaranty Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
