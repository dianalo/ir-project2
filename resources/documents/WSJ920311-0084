New York City said its investigation, which was conductedby the law firm of Lord Day andamp; Lord, Barrett Smith, found noproof First Boston engaged in any improper trading activity.However, the law firm said the probe is continuing, citing&quot;ambiguities in the underlying circumstances&quot; of the case.</LP><TEXT>   First Boston, a unit of CS First Boston Inc., was leadmanager on $1.06 billion of general obligation bonds sold byNew York City last week. The city intended to use a smallportion of the proceeds from the bond sale to repurchaseabout $84 million of taxable bonds outstanding.   In a letter to the SEC's enforcement division, attorneysat Lord Day andamp; Lord said the city learned March 3 for thefirst time that First Boston owned about $13 million of thebonds the city planned to repurchase. That was the same dayas the bond sale, but the attorneys said the discovery camein the evening, after the bonds were priced. The city saidFirst Boston purchased the bonds in late February.   The city said it immediately requested that First Bostonprovide the city with all relevant information regarding thepurchase. Among other things, the city sought to determinewhether any securities laws were violated, including insidertrading, and whether First Boston had planned to profit onthe bond purchase by selling the bonds back to the city at ahigher price than it paid. The city also sought to determinewhether the bond purchases by First Boston affected thecity's legal ability to complete the bond offering.   In a statement, First Boston's president and chiefexecutive officer, Archibald Cox Jr., said the firm boughtthe $13 million of bonds as the city's agent and was&quot;dismayed that anyone felt some ambiguity existed regardingthe possibility that First Boston intended to mark up theprice.&quot;   Although Lord Day andamp; Lord said it didn't find proof of anyimproprieties, the law firm told the SEC that &quot;because ofambiguities in the underlying circumstances and the fact thatour investigation is continuing, we have been unable toprovide the city with any definitive conclusion,&quot; regardingFirst Boston's intentions with regards to the bond purchase.</TEXT></DOC>
