According to data compiled by industry analyst A.D. Murphy for Variety, last year's movie revenues topped the previous 1984 record of $4 billion. Mr. Murphy says about 5% of the increase came from higher ticket prices in such heavy movie-going areas as New York. The remainder of the increase was from higher ticket sales.    Last year's record doesn't come as a surprise. After a strong summer and fall season, Mr. Murphy and other industry analysts began predicting that 1987's box office revenues would hit a new high. They are undecided, however, about industry prospects in the event of a 1988 recession.    The industry's 1987 record revenue doesn't mean that all movie makers are basking in success. Just three studios accounted for nearly half the bounty.    As expected, by far the largest share of the pie went to Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp., which was the No. 1 studio for the second year in a row with 20% of the market. Paramount produced three of the top four movies last year; the No. 3 film, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; continues to draw audiences.    Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. inched ahead of Warner Communications Inc. for the No. 2 market share with about 14% of the box office. Analysts say Disney's performance is the most remarkable considering that its current management team is only in its second year of production. In 1985, it had a scant 3% of the box office. &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; is the biggest hit of the Christmas season and continues to rake in revenues. As of yesterday, it had sold about $84 million of tickets.    Warner, meanwhile, came in a close third with about 13% of the box office, according to Mr. Murphy. The studio's success earlier last year with &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; kept it in the top ranks despite disappointing results with other 1987 films, including &quot;Who's That Girl,&quot; which featured rock star Madonna, and Steven Spielberg's &quot;Innerspace.&quot; Two of the studio's holiday movies, &quot;Nuts&quot; and &quot;Empire of the Sun,&quot; were initially opened in a limited number of theaters; additional theater openings and critical acclaim are expected to help boost revenues for both films.    Another studio, tiny Orion Pictures Inc., did well last year, as a result of its release of &quot;Platoon&quot; and a number of other, more modest successes such as the recent &quot;Throw Momma From the Train&quot; and &quot;Robocop.&quot; But other large studios didn't fare so well. While MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios had two of the top 10 movies, &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;Secret of My Success,&quot; other 1987 films such as &quot;Jaws: The Revenge&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot; were disappointing.    And Coca-Cola Co.'s Columbia Pictures Inc. unit, which recently merged with Tri-Star Pictures Inc., fared even worse with the year's big-budget clinker, &quot;Ishtar.&quot; Likewise, its Bill Cosby movie, &quot;Leonard Part VI,&quot; bombed over Christmas.    News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Co. &quot;didn't do very well until Christmas,&quot; notes Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. analyst Mark Manson. But the recent release of &quot;Broadcast News&quot; by writer-director Jim Brooks &quot;looks like its going to bail them out,&quot; he adds. As for Fox's &quot;Wall Street,&quot; which opened in a limited number of theaters initially, &quot;it's premature to say whether it will play well nationally,&quot; Mr. Manson says.    Mr. Manson notes that the top-ranking studios will continue to reap benfits in 1988 from the videocassette sales of their films. That could particularly benefit Orion, which recently established its own video distribution unit. It could also boost profit for Disney, which had a number of films that --while not blockbusters --were solid commercial successes that typically attract video audiences. &quot;You can sell as many home videos of a movie that grossed $60 million at the box office as you can of a movie that grossed $100 million,&quot; says Mr. Manson.    Executives who collect data on the industry say 1987 was encouraging because of the mix of films that drew audiences. &quot;The revenues are spread out over a wider variety of movies,&quot; says John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Adds Philip Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment Data Inc., &quot;You don't have so-called youth pictures dominating the market.&quot;    Since box office business typically drops precipitously after the holiday season, &quot;the next week will be critical for some of the movies released during Christmas,&quot; says Mr. Garfinkle. &quot;Then we'll see how much success is coming from the holidays and how much these films can hold on for themselves.&quot;    ---                   Top Grossing Movies of '87                         (As of Dec. 31)                                                    REVENUE MOVIE                        DISTRIBUTOR      (In millions) Beverly Hills Cop II         Paramount              $153.6 Platoon*                     Orion                   136.0 Fatal Attraction             Paramount               126.0 The Untouchables             Paramount                76.0 Three Men and a Baby         Disney                   70.8 The Secret of My Success     Universal                67.0 Stakeout                     Disney                   65.7 Lethal Weapon                Warner                   65.2 The Witches of Eastwick      Warner                   63.8 Dragnet                      Universal                57.2 *Released 12/19/86; doesn't include approximately $2 million in 1986 revenue Sources: Entertainment Data Inc.; industry estimates</TEXT></DOC>
