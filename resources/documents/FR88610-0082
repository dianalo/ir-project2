App. I (1982)) which requiresthat timely notice of each meeting of a Federal advisory committee be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This notice announces that the EPA will convenea 1-day meeting of the Biotechnology Science Advisory Committee Subcommitteeon Premanufacture Notification Review (BSAC Subcommittee) on July 14, 1988.BTA has voluntarily submitted four PMNs for EPA review under TSCA section5 as requested in the Agency's June 26, 1986 Statement of Policy (51 FR23326). The PMN microorganisms are four strains of <T3>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</T3> which have been genetically engineeredto carry genes for antibiotic resistance that came from microorganismsin a different genus. BTA plans to conduct small-scale field tests in twolocations to evaluate the ability of the genetically engineered <T3>B. japonicum</T3> strains to compete and form nodules on soybean plants.The antibiotic resistance genes will provide a means of monitoring thesurvival and location of the PMN strains under field conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Announcement of the Receipt of Premanufacture Notification</ITAG>A notice announcing the receipt of the PMNs designated as: P 88-1275, P88-1276, P 88-1277, and P 88-1278 appeared as part of the weekly noticeof PMNs published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19035). These PMNs arethe subject of this meeting of the BSAC Subcommittee. Please consult that<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for specific information on these PMNs.Copies of the PMN submission are available in the public file identifiedwith the docket control number OPTS-51706, and copies are available onrequest from the TSCA Assistance Office by calling (202) 554-1404.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose of the Meeting</ITAG>The BSAC Subcommittee will meet to advise EPA in its review of these PMNmicroorganisms under the authority of section 5 of TSCA. EPA has decidedthat expert assistance is desirable because risk assessment for geneticallymodified microorganisms released to the environment is a new area. Thecurrent limitations in scientific data on such releases require the Agencyto conduct case specific studies. As scientific data on environmental releasesbecomes available, general principles for review of these releases maybe established. Since such principles are not yet established, EPA plansto consult with experts outside the agency during its review of certainPMN microorganisms.EPA will develop a risk assessment, estimate the benefits associated withthe new substances, and reach a regulatory decision. The risk assessmentwill be based on the advice of the BSAC Subcommittee, the information submittedin the PMN, and other available information. The risk assessment will estimatethe benefits associated with field experiments using the PMN microorganisms,and evaluate whether any risk associated with the PMN microorganisms maybe unreasonable.Members of the BSAC Subcommittee will review EPA's draft risk assessmentand advise the Agency of their own assessment of the available data onthe potential hazards and likely exposures to the PMN microorganisms. Thesubcommittee members will review any written comments provided by the publicin advance of the meeting and will assist in identifying additional informationthat may be necessary to determine whether the environmental release ofthe microorganism may present an unreasonable risk to human health or theenvironment. After this public meeting, EPA may request additional informationfrom the PMN submitter.  EPA has authority to allow manufacture and use, to prohibit release orto impose restrictions on manufacture and use of the PMN microorganisms.EPA has 90 days to review the PMN. The review period may be extended byagreement between BTA and EPA, or unilaterally by EPA under section 5(c)of TSCA. EPA has established a file, OPTS-00092 that specifically concernsthis meeting of the BSAC Subcommittee on Premanufacture Notification Review.The risk assessment as well as public comments on the PMN submission willbe available in this public docket after July 1, 1988.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment and Participation  </ITAG>The meeting will be open to the public although parts of the meeting maybe closed to allow disussion of confidential business information. Membersof the BSAC Subcommittee will hear the comments of individuals who haverequested the opportunity to speak. EPA will also describe in more detailits approach to risk assessment for these PMN microorganisms.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Subject of the Meeting  </ITAG>The PMN microorganisms being reviewed by EPA are four strains of geneticallyengineered <T3>Bradyrhizobium japonicum.</T3> BTA has selected two parent strainsof <T3>B. japonicum</T3>: USDA 110 and an isolate from a field in Pepin County,Wisconsin. Genes for streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance from <T3>Shigella flexneri</T3> and termination sequences from <T3>Escherichia coli</T3> were genetically engineered into each parentstrain resulting in two PMN microorganisms. A different construction usingkanamycin/neomycin resistance genes from <T3>Klebsiella pneumoniae</T3> were genetically engineered into each parentstrain. As a result, a total of four new microorganisms (containing geneticmaterial from different genera) were created. BTA has conducted researchon some of the PMN microorganisms in contained facilities such as laboratories,growth chambers, and greenhouses, and now wishes to continue its researchand development (Randamp;D) activities by conducting small-scale field trials. There will be two small-scale field trials: (1) To determine the effectof the insertion of marker genes into <T3>B. japonicum</T3> on competition and symbiotic performance under fieldconditions and (2) to compare different methods of applying <T3>B. japonicum</T3> to soybean seeds. The field trials will be conductedin: (1) A 100 acre field at BTA's Chippewa Agricultural Station near Arkansawin Pepin County, Wisconsin and (2) a 77 acre field at McAllister Seed Company'sfacilities near Mount Pleasant in Henry County, Iowa.  The use of these PMN microorganisms which are ``marked'' with the introducedantibiotic resistance genes will allow BTA to monitor the survival andlocation of these PMN microorganisms under actual field conditions. Thesefield tests are one step in BTA's attempt to develop strains of <T3>B. japonicum</T3> with an increased ability to convert atmosphericnitrogen to forms of nitrogen utilized by crop plants. The identificationof a genomic site suitable for integration of genetic material withoutaffecting normal cell growth or symbiotic function is an important stepin developing a commercial product.  BTA has submitted information concerning: the identity of the organism,genetic engineering techniques used, exposure data, human health considerations,the locations of the proposed field test, design and supervision of thetests, methods of application, monitoring and control procedures, and environmentalfate and effects.  BTA voluntarily submitted the PMNs on May 3, 1988, although these microorganismsare part of BTA's Randamp;D activities. The company took this action in compliancewith EPA's ``Statement of Policy'' published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313). In that notice,EPA stated that certain microbial products were subject to TSCA, and requestedcommercial researchers intending to release new living microorganisms intothe environment to report their activities to the Agency, rather than toconduct such activities under the exemption for Randamp;D provided by section5(h)(3) of TSCA. These microorganisms developed by BTA are subject to PMNrequirements, because they contain genetic material from more than onetaxonomic genus, and therefore are defined as new microorganisms in the1986 Statement of Policy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 7, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
