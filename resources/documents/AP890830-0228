DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators, as promised following theindictment of 46 futures brokers and traders, have come up with apackage of reforms and now want to hear what the industry thinks.   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees thefutures industry, voted unanimously Tuesday to submit the proposedrules changes for public comment.   The reform package, which includes increased surveillance oncommodities exchange floors at the start and end of trading days,was proposed after 46 brokers and traders in Chicago's futuresexchanges were indicted Aug. 2 on fraud and racketeering charges.   Those charges, stemming from a lengthy undercover federal probeof the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade,included allegations that traders cheated their customers throughfalsified records and pre-arranged trades.   ``We support their efforts to address these issues,'' said AndrewA. Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ``After athorough review process earlier this year, our own board ofgovernors approved a comprehensive set of rule enhancements that arevery similar to what the CFTC proposed today.''   BOT President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Donovan said in astatement, ``We have not yet reviewed the CFTC's new and proposedrules; however it appears that many of the recommendations areeither already in place at the Chicago Board of Trade or will soonbe implemented.''   The markets themselves have proposed tighter trading rules andupdated surveillance and auditing techniques to combat abuse.   Yemma noted that both exchanges announced plans to develop anelectronic surveillance system that will use hand-held computerterminals in the trading pits.   He said the exchanges hope to have the new system developedwithin a year and ``with the adoption of these measures, we areconfident that opportunities for the types of abuses raised in theindictments will be effectively eliminated.''   Critics have claimed the traditional ``open outcry'' system oftrading, in which participants use shouts and hand signals to maketransactions in crowded, hectic trading pits, makes it difficult totrack and detect fraud.   ``The commission is committed to take all necessary steps toprotect the public confidence in these markets,'' said CFTCChairwoman Wendy Gramm. ``The action we are taking today willreinforce our regulatory system.''   The Chicago charges alleged that traders cheated customers byfalsifying trading cards, which record purchase and salesinformation, or altering the time that trades were made to takeadvantage of price shifts in the market.   Some brokers allegedly conspired with exchange members who tradeonly for their own accounts, known as locals, to finalize tradesafter the close of the market in order to illegally try to set amore advantageous price.   In addition to tightening surveillance on the nation's commodityexchange floors, the package calls for:   _Easily identifiable trading cards with preprinted informationthat would allow regulators to reconstruct the sequence of a trade,an investigative practice known as following the audit trail.   _Frequent collection, at least every 30 minutes and eventuallyevery 15 minutes, of trading cards to reduce the potential foraltering records to conceal illegal trading activity.   _Preventing people with histories of rules violations fromserving on the governing boards, disciplinary committees orarbitration panels of exchanges or registered futures associations.   ``All of these changes will help detect but also deter'' illegaltrading, said Mrs. Gramm after the commission vote.   The CFTC's proposed changes are subject to comment by interestedparties for the next 30 to 60 days before the commission can makeits approval final.   One element put into effect immediately was the creation of apilot surveillance program. The Floor Surveillance Task Force willhave responsibility for direct examination of trading cards andother trading records on the exchange floor.   The pilot program is designed to enable the commission todetermine its needs for a permanent floor surveillance program inthe near future.</TEXT></DOC>
