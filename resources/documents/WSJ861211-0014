Such a strategy might call for selling portions of the Chicago-based services, chemical and automotive concern to those allies, which weren't identified, in exchange for their support, Mr. Jacobs's group indicated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The move, if successful, could slash hundreds of millions of dollars from the group's acquisition costs.    The investor group also said in the filing that it is considering a tender offer and indicated that Minstar Inc., which Mr. Jacobs controls, intends to boost its 5% stake in Borg-Warner to at least 50%. Minstar said it is seeking antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department so it can boost its holding beyond its current 4.3 million shares. Such permission could take three weeks, during which time Minstar couldn't raise its stake.    As previously reported, Minstar proposed buying Borg-Warner for between $43 and $48 a share, or $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, last month, but so far Borg-Warner has refused to respond to the bid.    Although the SEC filing didn't say so, potential third-party allies might include Borg-Warner's largest shareholder, GAF Corp., which holds a 9.6% stake and has said it also may seek to buy the company.    GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical concern, is believed to be particularly interested in Borg-Warner's chemical business, which had $928 million in revenue last year. Yesterday, GAF reiterated its comment of last month, when Minstar first disclosed its intentions. GAF said that &quot;as Borg-Warner's principal shareholder, we are interested in any development that will enhance shareholder values. However, the tentative nature of the present proposal draws into question the significance of the Minstar initiative.&quot;    Mr. Jacobs said yesterday that he hasn't met with GAF to discuss an alliance, though he didn't rule out the possibility.    The Jacobs group, which currently holds a 7.7% stake, also said it may consult with other concerned shareholders and seek to influence Borg-Warner's future policies. In earlier bids for companies, Mr. Jacobs has threatened to call special shareholders meetings to oust management opposing his efforts, but the tactic has proved unnecessary. In the case of AMF Inc., which Minstar eventually acquired on friendly terms, Mr. Jacobs had wanted shareholders to throw out AMF's &quot;poison pill&quot; defense. Borg-Warner has a poison pill in place.    Minstar had said its &quot;friendly&quot; bid was contingent on seeing Borg-Warner's books. Mr. Jacobs has said that neither a letter outlining that offer nor repeated phone calls by him to Borg-Warner's president have elicited a response.    Mr. Jacobs said he was disappointed and surprised that Clarence E. Johnson, Borg-Warner's president, had ignored his group's bid &quot;because I'd been assured by him it wasn't something he would do. He has said he was always interested in enhancing shareholder value. If he is interested in doing that, why at least isn't he talking to us?&quot; Mr. Jacobs said.    As a result of Borg-Warner's silence, the Jacobs group said it would explore various strategies for gaining control of the company. That might mean an amended merger proposal, acquisition of additional shares either through a tender offer or public or private stock purchases, or the &quot;entering into arrangements with third parties who may be interested in joining with (the group) to acquire control.&quot; The SEC filing said such an arrangement may &quot;contemplate the sale or disposition of portions of the company's assets&quot; to the third parties after the group wins control.    Borg-Warner had no immediate response to the latest Jacobs effort.    Analysts are divided on the intent of Mr. Jacobs's filing. &quot;Maybe he knows the company a lot better than most of us suspect,&quot; said Richard Henderson of New York-based Pershing andamp; Co. The filing &quot;would certainly indicate he's serious.&quot; But Julius Sas, a takeover analyst at Balis andamp; Zorn Inc. in New York questioned whether Mr. Jacobs could obtain the financing to buy Borg-Warner. &quot;He's trying to be a pain in the neck so management will give him the money to walk away,&quot; contended Mr. Sas.    Borg-Warner management has been mum on whether it is seeking a friendly suitor. James F. Bere, chairman, has said only, &quot;I can assure you we're talking to a lot of people.&quot;    Some analysts have mentioned the Robert Bosch Group, a closely held West German automotive parts and appliance maker, as a possible friendly suitor. Bosch holds 9.3% of Borg-Warner. But the West German firm, which bought into Borg-Warner with an eye to future joint ventures, has done very little with the company, said Jack L. Wentz, Borg-Warner's corporate secretary. That could be an indication that the two companies may not be suited to working together.    Bosch, however, could be a deterrent to a hostile suitor. Under an agreement, Bosch can't sell its stake in one block without board approval, but instead must do so through a public offering or in piecemeal fashion. Also, Bosch can't boost its stake above 10% without board approval.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Borg-Warner's stock closed at $38.75, up $1.625. </TEXT></DOC>
