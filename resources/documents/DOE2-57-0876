It is shown, that as in the processes of the deuteronfragmentation type, it is necessary to take into account, the graphsof rescattering and absorption of the {pi}-meson by a deuteron nucleon,as well as a non-nucleon, quark, degree of freedom in the deuteron. Thecomparison of the theoretical calculations with the experimental datais performed. 26 refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
