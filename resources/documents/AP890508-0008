The closest Joe Testa came to the military was Fort Hood nearKilleen, the Dallas Times Herald reported.   He was absent without leave twice, received suspended sentencestotaling nine months of hard labor and never rose above the rank ofprivate, records show.   Testa's ability to rise to the presidency of the veterans'group, before he was removed in January, illustrates a growingproblem: As America shows a belated appreciation for those whoserved in Vietnam, some people are embellishing their roles in thewar, and even fabricating military careers.   ``When the war was unpopular, people were reluctant to admitthey had served in Vietnam,'' said Barry Kasinitz, public affairsofficer for the 30,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America inWashington, D.C. ``But now, being a Vietnam veteran is chic, andyou see an awful lot of people making up war stories.''   Experts say some do it for glory or attention; some to justifytheir drug abuse, unemployment or other personal problems; and somefor the camaraderie of veterans' groups, where they can drink beerand swap stories, real or imagined, about the war.   ``These are people who wanted to be combat vets, who, as malesin our society, felt they had to prove themselves by fighting in awar,'' said David Rodriguez, a veterans' counselor in Dallas. ``Butthey were unwilling, or they didn't get the opportunity, to go toVietnam.   ``So now they live the experience vicariously. They hang aroundwith Vietnam vets and call themselves Vietnam vets.''   Veterans and government officials said there may be legions ofpeople who have invented or inflated their military service inSoutheast Asia. The impostors often go unchallenged, said B.G.Burkett, treasurer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund of Texas.   ``The etiquette among Vietnam vets is, you don't ask aboutanother vet's experience,'' said Burkett, an Army lieutenant inVietnam and now a Dallas stockbroker. ``If they want to talk aboutit, fine, but you don't pry. That allows fraud to exist even amongVietnam veterans.''   Testa moved and did not leave a forwarding address, according tothe U.S. Postal Service and his former employer, Tinamou Corp., amarketing firm. The telephone directory has no listing for Testa inthe Dallas-Fort Worth area.   Representatives of Dallas veterans' groups and the VeteransAdministration say they don't know his whereabouts.</TEXT></DOC>
