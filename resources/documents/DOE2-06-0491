The growth of first-year shootsof willow (Salix viminalis) is simulated by means of a model based onphotosynthesis. The production is examined over a 15-year period andat 13 different locations. The mean yearly stem production ranged between10.0 tonnes of dry matter per hectare and year at Helsingborg and 6.5tonnes per hectare and year at Hagshult. The yearly variation was within+-25% for sites located in the inland areas while those at the coastgenerally showed variations within +-15%. On a regional basis, Skaanehad the highest mean production with 9.4 tonnes per hectare and yearwhile the production of the Maelardalen region was about 13% lower. Thedifference in production between Maelardalen and Oestergoetland was about2%. A sensitivity analysis showed that the growth response of clonesto temperature might be an important selection criterion when aimingat increasing the production. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
