WilliamSeidman said in a luncheon speech to the National Press Club. ``...These institutions are losing over a billion dollars per month.''   Seidman's agency insures deposits in commercial banks, not thriftinstitutions, but his agency is offering recommendations for solvingthe crisis in the savings and loan industry.   Some analysts recommend tapping Seidman's fund, a move heopposes, and estimate that the Sandamp;L cleanup will eventually cost $50billion to $100 billion.   The Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corporation, which insuringdeposits in thrift institutions, is technically insolvent.Regulators have been spending as little cash as possible, puttingtogether rescue packages with promissory notes and guaranteescommitting revenue they expect to receive for the next 30 years froman assessment on healthy Sandamp;Ls.   Few analysts believe the industry can bear such a burden for thatlong.   Seidman did not call directly for a taxpayer bailout, sayingonly, ``It's up to the Treasury Department and Congress to determinewhich alternative makes the most sense.''   He said that the Sandamp;L industry ``certainly can contribute itspart'' but added that ``beyond that contribution, the governmentmust find the resources to meet this problem.''   Seidman's recommendation to quickly close about 90 seriouslyinsolvent Sandamp;Ls differs sharply from the views of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, responsible for regulating the nation's 3,028federally insured Sandamp;Ls.   The bank board's approach has been to rescue most failed Sandamp;Ls andkeep them open, fearing that massive closings would leave someregions without service and devastate local economies by floodingthe market with foreclosed real estate.   Others, including former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,and Congress' General Accounting Office, say it will be cheaper inthe long run to spend heavily now to close failed Sandamp;Ls as soon aspossible.   On Tuesday, bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said Sandamp;L lossesshrank dramatically last quarter as the federal governmenttransferred the red ink onto its own books through rescues andclosings.   Sandamp;Ls lost $1.52 billion in the July-September quarter, down 60percent from losses of $3.82 billion in the second quarter and $3.93billion in the first, he said.   Wall also hinted at the recommendation his agency plans to offernext month for financing the Sandamp;L rescue effort.   He told reporters that the plan resembles this year's rescue ofthe Farm Credit System, which featured borrowing backed by theTreasury and a special board including the Treasury secretary tooversee bailout spending.   ``What we have on the agenda isn't far from that,'' Wall said. Hedeclined to elaborate.   The $9.27 billion in Sandamp;L losses through Sept. 30 already havetopped last year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion.   Wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarterto the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed Sandamp;Ls sofar this year. He said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 bythe end of the year.   Some analysts and members of Congress have criticized the dealsbecause the bank board, lacking cash to spend immediately, agrees toabsorb much of the rescued institutions' future losses. They saylosses will continue to mount, showing up later as obligations ofthe government's Sandamp;L deposit insurance fund rather than on theindustry's books.   Wall argues, however, that the rescues reduce losses by achievingefficiency through mergers and by eliminating insolventinstitutions' need to run up the eventual costs to the government byoffering high interest rates to attract deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
