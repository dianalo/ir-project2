At a briefing for French reporters, Bull Chairman FrancisLorentz said the state-owned computer giant remains innegotiations with both U.S. companies. In the past, Bull hasdeclined to identify its partners reputedly involved.</LP><TEXT>   IBM and Hewlett have been widely named in press reports asBull's suitors. Still, both companies yesterday remainedreticent about the talks.   Bull is interested in finding a new partner in acomputer-chip technology called Risc, which serves as theengine for highpowered computer workstations. Hewlett has thehottest Risc chip at the moment; while IBM is touting a newstandard it will develop with Apple Computer Inc. andMotorola Inc.   Mr. Lorentz also confirmed that any final agreement wouldinclude a small equity stake in Bull -- a symboliccounterbalance to the 4.7% stake held by Japan's NEC Corp.   A Bull spokesman said Mr. Lorentz's main purpose intalking to French reporters was to calm some of the wilderspeculation that has dominated the country's business pressin recent weeks. Yesterday, for example, French petroleumgiant Elf Aquitaine denied reports that it is being pushed totake a stake in Bull.   Mr. Lorentz also wished to give a more realistic sense oftiming on the negotiations, the spokesman added. He said that&quot;it will take some time&quot; to conclude any alliance. Bull mustfirst make its recommendations to the French government, Mr.Lorentz noted, which would then make a decision and pass thematter back to Bull.   The possible technical agreements with both companies arestill being hammered out, a process that always takes longerthan expected. Industry executives said IBM is pushing for abroader pact than Bull originally envisioned, possiblyincluding sales by Bull of IBM-made personal computers.Hewlett is said to be willing to match many of IBM'sproposals. Both companies are eager to get new outlets fortheir technology in Europe.   Separately, Bull said it had raised $1.1 billion in loansand credit, mainly to refinance and consolidate a web ofdebts connected with its ongoing restructuring. About $850million in loans will be advanced by a syndicate of 30 banks,led by J.P. Morgan, National Westminster, Banque Nationale deParis and Societe Generale, the company said.   An additional credit line of $250 million was agreed on bya number of banks outside France, the company said. Bull andthe French government are likely to cite these new financingarrangements as a further argument for investing more statefunds in the troubled company.</TEXT></DOC>
