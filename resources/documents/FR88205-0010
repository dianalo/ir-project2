Background</ITAG>Section 205(a) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) requires that all electricrates subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission be ``just and reasonable.''\3\<NOTE/> In the exercise of this statutory responsibility, the Commissionseeks to set rates of return on common equity that are fair to both ratepayersand utility stockholders. The allowed rate of return on common equity isnow determined individually for each utility on a case-by-case basis. InJuly 1984, the Commission adopted procedures for the generic determinationof benchmark rates of return on common equity and for their applicationin individual cases.\4\<NOTE/> The Commission has conducted three prior proceedings to determinebenchmark rates of return and has made those rates advisory only. In thatadvisory only status, benchmark rates are intended to provide guidanceto parties to rate proceedings and to serve as a reference point for theCommission in setting allowed rates of return.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 16 U.S.C. 824d (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Order No. 389, 49 FR 29946.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 29954As required by andSection; 37.4 of the Commission's regulations, the Commissioninitiated a fourth proceeding to determine benchmark rates of return byissuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR or Notice) on September 30,1987.\6\<NOTE/> The Commission received 14 timely comments.\7\<NOTE/> Table 1 lists estimates of the average cost of common equityfor the base year submitted by commenters, using the discounted cash flowmethodology.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Generic Determination Rate of Return on Common Equityfor Public Utilities. 52 FR 37326 (Oct. 6, 1987) (Docket No. RM87-35-000)(notice of proposed rulemaking) (Issued Sept. 30, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Commission refers to commenters by abbreviations inthe text that follows.

Discussion</ITAG>A. OverviewAs discussed more fully below, the Commission adopts the procedure proposedin the NOPR for determining and updating the benchmark rate of return byrelying on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method for estimating the rateof return on common equity.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission estimates that the average cost of commonequity for the jurisdictional operations of electric utilities during thebase year was 11.21 percent. This is based on an unadjusted base year dividendyield of 6.70 percent, a growth rate of 4.34 percent, and a flotation costadjustment of .02 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Commission notes that those procedures were also adoptedin the third annual proceeding.The benchmark rates of return also become applicable to proceedings underFPA section 206. The benchmark rate of return in effect on the date theCommission sets a rate for investigation in the section 206 proceedingwill generally be applied.In the NOPR, the Commission expressed its concern that, despite numerousurgings in previous rulemaking proceedings, parties are not giving dueconsideration to the benchmark rate of return. Therefore, the Commissionis specifically requesting that all rate case participants, including staffand administrative law judges, evaluate the reasonableness of the applicablebenchmark rate of return. The Commission believes that the analyses itreceives will enable the Commission Staff and participants in the proceedingto use the benchmark rates of return as points of departure in settingallowed rates of return.B. The Applicability of the DCF ModelThe Commission is relying on the discounted cash flow method for estimatingthe rate of return on common equity. Specifically, that formula is:<ITAG tagnum="24">k= (1+.5g)y+g</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">k = market required rate of return</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">y = current dividend yield (current annual dividend rate divided bycurrent market price)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">g = expected annual dividend growth rate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(1+.5g)=dividend adjustment factor for quarterly dividend payments</ITAG>Several commenters assert that the price volatility experienced by thestock markets during October 1987 makes the DCF model unusable.\9\<NOTE/> American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP) statesthat ``there have been large speculative forces operating in the marketfor a substantial period'' \1\\0\<NOTE/> and that those forces are responsible for the price volatility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP) at 4-5,Associated Utility Services, Inc. (AUS) at 21, Consumers Power Company(CPC) at 3, Edison Electric Institute (EEI) at 32, Southern CaliforniaEdison (SCE) at 2, and Alfred Winchell Whittaker (AWW) at 3-5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ AEP at 4.The Commission's use of the dividend yields for six months in the quarterlyindexing procedure is designed to smooth out short-term market fluctuationsthat might exist if it used spot yields. These fluctuations may or maynot be due to what AEP terms ``speculation''. However, if a utility's stockprice changes for a substantial period of time for whatever reason, thatutility seeking to raise new equity would be faced with a changed costof equity. Rather than misstating a utility's cost of equity, as AEP claims,the DCF model as applied by the Commission recognizes that price changescan reflect a changed cost of equity.Consumers Power Company (CPC) states that the recent extraordinary volatilityin stock prices has contributed to rapidly changing dividend yields. CPCthen cites the wide variability of yields as reducing the continuity ofcalculated yields used in the DCF model, and claims that the DCF methodologyis rendered inapplicable. In particular, CPC charges that the large fallin utility stock prices during October 1987 may have ``reduced the continuityof the calculated yields in the DCF model.''\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ CPC at 3.On October 19, 1987, the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Price Index declinedby more than 20 percent, while the Salomon Brothers' 100 Electric UtilityIndex declined by roughly half as much. By December 15, 1987, stock priceshad recovered somewhat: the decline in the Sandamp;P 500 Index had been reducedto 14 percent and that of the Salomon Brothers' 100 to less than 6 percent.\12\<NOTE/> During this period, dividend yields calculated on a dailybasis were volatile. The smoothing process discussed above is designedto remove short-term fluctuations in dividend yields and to preserve changesdue to longer term trends. Historically, utility dividend yields tend tomove in the same direction as interest rates. Appendix B shows the smootheddividend yields and smoothed 30-year Treasury bond yields for each of thequarterly benchmark periods since the first quarter of 1986. The yieldsfor the most recent period, measured between July and December 1987, arecircled. The most recent yield is in line with dividend yields and interestrates in other periods, indicating that the continuity of dividend yieldsis still intact. The Commission therefore finds that dividend yields, ascalculated in the quarterly indexing procedure, have not become discontinuous.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Calculated by Commission staff from raw data providedby Salomon Brothers.Alfred Winchell Whittaker (AWW) argues that market inefficiencies renderthe DCF model useless and cites some recent studies in the economic literature.\13\<NOTE/> He charges that for the market to be efficient, ``all investors[must] have access to all publicly available information, understand allof its implications, and correctly use the information in making all theirinvestment decisions.'' As the Commission stated in the previous proceeding,``[t]he efficient market theory is founded upon the proposition that `allrelevant information is widely and cheaply available to investors and thatall relevant and ascertainable information is already reflected in securityprices' ''.\14\<NOTE/> The efficient market literature cited by AWW claims thatvariations in stock market prices appear to be too large to be explainedby variations in subsequent dividend payments. The Commission consideredthis argument and rejected it in the previous proceeding, essentially becausethe findings of the studies cited are not generally accepted as provenpropositions.\15\<NOTE/> In addition, the dividend yield ``smoothing'' process usedin the benchmark quarterly indexing procedure reduces short-term pricevariations. Thus, if the theory of excessive stock price volatility citedby AWW\16\<NOTE/> proves correct, that fact would further support the use ofthe Commission's current methodology since it already smoothes ``excessive''price fluctuations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ AWW at 4-7.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ 52 FR 30, quoting Brealey, R. and Myers, S. <T3>Principles of Corporate Finance, </T3>McGraw-Hill (1984) at 266.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Order No. 461-A, 52 FR 5759.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ AWW at 4-5, citing R. Shiller ``The Volatility of StockMarket Prices,'' 235 <T3>Science </T3>33 (Jan. 1987) and Shiller, ``Stock Prices and SocialDynamics,'' <T3>Brookings Papers on Economic Activity </T3>457, 490 (1984).AEP argues that the DCF model misstates the cost of common equity capital.AEP argues that the model assumes erroneously that the market price ofa stock is primarily or exclusively determined by current dividends andexpected future increases in dividends, and ignores other factors suchas expectations about changes in stock prices, inflation rates and speculativeconsiderations.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ AEP at 3. AEP misinterprets the theory underlying the DCF model. The DCF model usedby the Commission shows the relationship between stock prices and dividends,growth rate of dividends, and shareholders' required rate of return. Itdoes not assume that price is primarily determined by dividends alone.The DCF model assumes that price, ``P<T2>O</T2>'', is determined by a combination of factors: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L0(000),tp0,p8,8/1,i1,s10,3,1,10,r10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>P</H1><T2>O</T2><H1>=</H1><H1>D</H1><T2>O</T2>(1+.5g) <H2>k-g </H2><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>Two of these factors relate to dividends. The indicated current dividendis represented by the ``D<T2>o</T2>'' term and the expected growth rate of dividends is representedby the ``g'' term. The other factor, the shareholders' required returnon equity, the ``k'' term, also influences price. This term has severalcomponents, including expectations about the real interest rates, the expectedrate of inflation, and the ``risks'' associated with owning a particularstock. It is this term that is estimated by the DCF model. Contrary toAEP's claim, prices in the DCF model change in response to changes in expectationsassociated with the ``g'' and ``k'' terms. Two commenters question the ability of the constant growth DCF model toforecast stock market prices.\18\<NOTE/> Associated Utility Services, Inc. (AUS) claims that equityprice behavior is quite different from the assumptions of the constantgrowth DCF model. AUS cites a study it commissioned which found the constantgrowth DCF model wanting in its ability to predict accurately one-periodstock price changes. AEP criticizes the DCF formula for its ``inabilityto anticipate or explain the large movements in stock prices during October1987.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ AEP at 4-5 and AUS at 26-27.The Commission agrees that the DCF model is a poor method for predictingfuture stock prices. A simplifying assumption underlying the constant growthDCF model is that the firm will grow at a constant rate. This implies thatbook value and dividends can be thought of as growing at roughly the samerate. If there were no changes in expectations from one year to the next,prices could be expected to grow at the same rate as earnings, dividends,and book value. AUS tested the relationship between a percentage changein market price and percentage changes in per share earnings, dividends,and book value over a one-year period. Since expectations do change, itis not surprising that AUS found that the model did a poor job of explainingchanges in stock prices. The DCF model is used to estimate the return requiredby investors at the time the analysis is performed. It is not intendedto forecast price changes, changes in market conditions, or changes inexpectations. A year later, expectations about interest rates, dividends,and growth rates will likely have changed. Prices change because expectationschange. A test to determine whether a DCF model can forecast stock pricechanges is not a valid test of the model.Several commenters question the size of the difference between the benchmarkrate of return and bond yields.\19\<NOTE/> The Commission finds problems with commenter studies measuringthe premium between the quarterly benchmark rates of return and bond yields.Several commenters use spot bond yields in their analyses.\20\<NOTE/> In the quarterly indexing procedure used to develop the benchmarkrate, the Commission uses a six-month dividend yield to smooth short-termmarket fluctuations inherent in spot yields. A similar smoothing processshould be used to remove short-term fluctuations from bond yields beforeany comparison is made.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ AUS at 59, CPC at 2-3, and AWW at i-ii.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ AUS and CPC used spot yields. It could not be ascertainedwhether AWW used spot yields or smoothed yields.In addition, some commenters mismatched the time periods for comparisonbetween the benchmark rate and bond yields. While it is true that a benchmarkrate of return is meant to apply to a particular period, it is calculatedby the Commission using dividend yield data from a period prior to theapplicability period. Therefore, a fair comparison should contrast thebenchmark rate of return with contemporaneous smoothed bond yields.AUS argues that the validity of the Commission's benchmark rate of returnshould be tested by analyzing the reasonableness of the quarterly DCF calculations.AUS compares each of the quarterly benchmark rates of return \21\<NOTE/> with the yields of A-rated public utility bonds for the benchmarkapplicability period. The decline in the spread between those benchmarkrates and bond yields from 4.12 percentage points for the February to April1986 benchmark period to 0.74 percentage points for the August to October1987 benchmark period demonstrates, in AUS's words, ``the basic infirmityof the DCF approach.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Calculated without regard to the cap initially used forindexing purposes.Concerning AUS's test of the validity of the benchmark rate of return,the Commission notes that AUS's risk premiums were incorrectly calculated.The correct comparison contrasting the benchmark rate of return with contemporaneousyields on the A-rated bonds used by AUS appears in Table 2. This tablepresents data beginning with the results of the second annual proceeding,when the Commission adopted a six-month average dividend yield for usein updating the quarterly benchmarks through 1987. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Comparison of the DCF-Calculated Rate of Return on Common Equity andA-Rated Public Utility Bond Yields </T4><H1>Benchmark applicability period </H1><H1>Dividend yield measurement period </H1><H1>Benchmark rate of return (percent) </H1><H1>A-rated public utility bond yields (percent) </H1><H1>Spread (implied risk premium) (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">February 1986 to April 1986 <D>July 1985 to December 1985 </D><D>13.75 </D><D>11.80 </D><D>1.95</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">May 1986 to July 1986 <D>October 1985 to March 1986 </D><D>13.08 </D><D>10.83 </D><D>2.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">August 1986 to October 1986 <D>January 1986 to June 1986 </D><D>12.18 </D><D>9.81 </D><D>2.37</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">November 1986 to January 1987 <D>April 1986 to September 1986 </D><D>11.43 </D><D>9.42 </D><D>2.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">February 1987 to April 1987 <D>July 1986 to December 1986 </D><D>11.20 </D><D>9.35 </D><D>1.85</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">May 1987 to July 1987 <D>October 1986 to March 1987 </D><D>11.30 </D><D>9.13 </D><D>2.17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">August 1987 to October 1987 <D>January 1987 to June 1987 </D><D>11.74 </D><D>9.37 </D><D>2.37</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">November 1987 to January 1988 <D>April 1987 to September 1987 </D><D>12.27 </D><D>10.19 </D><D>2.08</D></ITAG></ITAG> In contrast with AUS's claim, the Commission finds the risk premiums impliedby its quarterly benchmark rates of return are consistent: over the two-yearperiod they varied by only 0.42 percentage points, and had an average valueof 2.13 percentage points. CPC claims that the DCF methodology produces benchmark equity returns withoutmeaningful premiums over prevailing debt rate levels \2\\2\<NOTE/> (the benchmark rate of return for the November 1987 to January1988 quarter was 12.24 percent, while the average yield of Baa utilitybonds in September 1987 was 11.58 percent). CPC suggests that this situationfalls short of the <T3>Bluefield </T3>standard that a utility should have an opportunity toearn returns comparable to unregulated companies of similar risk levels.\2\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ CPC at 2-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ Citing <T3>Bluefield Waterworks andamp; Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commissionof West Virginia, </T3>262 U.S. 679 (1923). CPC compares the benchmark rate applicable to the period November 1987through January 1988 (12.24 percent), calculated based on dividend yieldsand growth rates from April through September 1987, to spot yields forSeptember 1987 (11.58).\2\\4\<NOTE/> The difference in yields or risk premium, is 0.66 percentagepoints. The Commission disagrees with this analysis. As discussed above,bond yields must be smoothed to remove wide fluctuations in prices thatmay occur if spot yields are used. The smoothed bond yield is 10.19 percent.When the proper comparison is made, the premium is 2.05 percentage points.\2\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ CPC uses Moody's Baa-rated utility bonds. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ In computing the six-month bond yield the Commissionused the A-rated Moody's bond yields submitted by AUS as Schedule 6 inits comments. Since bonds rated Baa are more risky than bonds rated A,the premium between Baa bond yields and the benchmark will be slightlysmaller than that for A-rated bonds. AWW finds a negative correlation between the Commission's DCF-producedcost of equity and 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields_a result contraryto expectation since financial theory holds that the cost of equity reflectsthe current interest rate plus a constant premium for additional risk.\2\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ AWW at i-ii.   AWW does not present sufficient data for the Commission to verify his results.He does not specify whether his data represent spot yields or smoothedyields and/or whether they are from the benchmark measurement period orthe benchmark applicability period. In any event, a graph of the benchmarkrates of return and smoothed 30-year Treasury bond yields is shown in AppendixC. The two rates can be seen to change in the same direction. The Commission'sanalysis shows that the correlation between the two rates is positive.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ The coefficient of determination between the two ratesR\2\, is 0.97, indicating that 97 percent of the variation in the benchmarkrate of return is explained by changes in 30-year Treasury bond yields.The following Treasury bond yields were used in the calculation:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p7,7/8,s10,12</C> <H1>Constant maturity 30-yr U.S. Treasury bond yields</H1><H1>Benchmark applicability period</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">10.30<D>2/86-4/86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9.40<D>5/86-7/86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.13<D>8/86-10/86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.45<D>11/86-1/87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.47<D>2/87-4/87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.51<D>5/87-7/87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.01<D>8/87-10/87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.80<D>11/87-1/88</D></ITAG></ITAG>Commenters suggest that the DCF formulation used by the Commission is wrong.\28\<NOTE/> In particular, Edison Electric Institute (EEI) states thatthe Commission's DCF methodology systematically understates the cost ofequity capital through its failure to distinguish properly between nominaland effective interest rates. EEI concludes that the DCF model fails toreflect the fact that utility dividends are generally paid quarterly.\29\<NOTE/> This charge is incorrect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\EEI at 34-35 and AWW at 7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\EEI at 34-35, citing C.J. Cicchetti and J.D. Makholm,``The FERC's Discounted Cash Flow: A Compromise in the Wrong Direction,''<T3>Public Utilities Fortnightly</T3> (July 9, 1987) pp. 11-15.The issue of the difference between nominal and effective interest rateshas been addressed by the Commission in previous proceedings.<NOTE/>\30\ The derivation of the Commission's DCF model began witha model which measures the investors' effective required rate of returnon common equity when dividends are paid quarterly.<NOTE/>\31\ The Commission described this formula as including ``thebenefits to investors of getting the dividends in four quarterly installmentsrather than in a lump sum at the end of the first year. These benefitsare, of course, the additional return investors may obtain by reinvestingthe dividends received quarterly in the same or another comparable investmentuntil the end of the year.''<NOTE/>\32\ Because the investor retains the quarterly payments andcan reinvest them, the utility's cost should reflect only the (nominal)amount of the dividends received by the investors. A model which allowsa utility to capture its investor's effective required rate of return oncommon equity would compensate the investor twice_once through the dividendactually paid by the utility and once through the investor's reinvestmentof that dividend in some alternative investment. The model used by theCommission subtracts the return investors receive through the reinvestmentof dividends from their required rate of return. The Commission finds thatits DCF model does properly distinguish between nominal and effective interestrates and that it also properly reflects quarterly dividends paid by utilities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ 52 F.R. at 15-16.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ 51 F.R. at 348.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>Id.</T3>AWW compares the DCF benchmark rates of return to book returns of unregulatedcompanies an argues that the DCF results are too low.<NOTE/>\33\ AWW concludes that the DCF methodology cannot be squaredwith the governing legal standards on utility returns set out in <T3>Federal Power Commission</T3> v. <T3>Hope Natural Gas.

Conversely, whena utility's market-to-book ratio is below one, applying a DCF-based allowedrate of return to a book value rate base results in earnings that are toohigh. Both commenters argue that the allowed rate of return should be appliedto a market value rate based rather than to book value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ AUS at 25 and AWW at 10.The following example demonstrates the circularity of their claim. Equitycapital costs generally rise as interest rates rise. Conversely, equitycapital costs generally fall as interest rates fall. During periods ofrising equity costs, utilities generally file for rate increases to coverthese higher costs. This action protects utility shareholders from declinesin the value of their stock. The result is a tendency to maintain a utility'sexisting market-to-book ratio during periods of rising equity costs.During periods of falling capital costs, the revenue required to meet shareholdercapital cost requirements also declines. Until a utility files for newrates at the lower capital cost, it continues to charge rates based onthe higher equity capital costs that existed when the current rates wereset. The result is a tendency for the utility to earn more than its shareholderscurrently require \3\\7\<NOTE/> and a concomitant increase in the price of the utility'scommon stock and market-to-book ratio.\3\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ Earnings above those required by the shareholders maybe offset, to some extent, by an increase in other costs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ The rise in the price of a utility's common stock underthese conditions is roughly analogous to the rise in the price of a bondas interest rates decline, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the interest payments to investors are worth more as capitalmarket rates decline.When capital costs are below those of the previous filing, applying theallowed rate of return to a market value rate base would perpetuate theunnecessarily high revenues at the expense of utility's customers. Applyingthe allowed rate of return to a book value rate base would reduce revenuesto the level required by shareholders at the new lower cost of equity.\3\\9\<NOTE/> These revenues will provide the utility with an opportunityto recover all costs including the cost of capital.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ If a utility is slow to file during a period of risingequity costs or if the regulator is slow to act, the utility's revenueswill fall below the level required by its shareholders. The utility's commonstock price and its market-to-book ratio would also fall. If the allowedrate is applied to this lower market value, the resulting revenue willremain below that required by the stockholders and the lower stock pricewill be perpetuated.The argument over the application of an allowed rate of return to a marketvalue rate base is an old one and the problem of circularity inherent inthat approach has been long and widely recognized. The Supreme Court'sstatement in <T3>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co. </T3>that ``ratescannot be made to depend upon `fair value' when the value of the goingenterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated''reflects its recognition of that problem.\4\\0\<NOTE/> The market value of an enterprise or its common stock dependsupon its earnings or anticipated earnings, which in turn depend upon therates allowed. Thus, market value is a result of the ratemaking processand may not properly be the beginning of that process as well.\4\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ 320 U.S. at 601.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Kahn, Alfred E., <T3>The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions: Principles,</T3>John Wiley andamp; Sons (1970) at 37-38.

SampleAs proposed, the Commission will use a sample of 100 electric utilities\4\\3\<NOTE/> based on the standards adopted in the prior annual proceedings.There are three bases for selection of this sample. First, the sample isrepresentative of the electric utility industry as a whole. Second, therelevant price and dividend data are generally available for all of thesecompanies. Finally, the data are readily accessible from more than onesource.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ 52 FR at 37,327. See Appendix D for a list of the utilitiesincluded in the sample.The sample consists essentially of those publicly traded electric utilitiesor combination companies that meet the following explicit standards:(1) The utility is predominantly electric; \4\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ Operationally the Commission has selected all companiesclassified in the industry groupings ``Electric Services'' or ``Electricand Other Services Combined'' by Standard and Poor's Compustat Services,Inc. (Compustat). These industry groupings are supposed to conform as nearlyas possible to the Office of Management and Budget's Standard IndustryClassification Codes. The Compustat ``Electric Services'' industry grouping(Industry Classification Number 4911) is defined as establishments engagedin the generation, transmission and/or distribution of electric energyfor sale where these services constitute 90% or more of revenues. The industrygrouping ``Electric and Other Services Combined'' (Industry ClassificationNumber 4931) is defined as establishments primarily engaged in providingelectric services in combination with other services, with electric servicesas the major part though less than 90% of revenues (Utility Compustat IIUser Manual (1987)).(2) The utility has its stock traded on either the New York or AmericanStock Exchanges; (3) The utility is included in the Utility Compustat II data base; and(4) The utility is not excluded by the Commission on a case-by-case basis,based on unique circumstances.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Three companies which met the first three standards wereeliminated from the sample. Southwestern Public Service Company was eliminatedbecause it is the only utility that uses a non-standard fiscal year whichdoes not end at the end of the calendar quarter. This causes its dividendyield to be out of time with the rest of the companies. CP National wasdeleted because, in spite of its being listed as a predominantly electriccompany, only 18 percent of its revenues in 1986 were derived from electricsales and only 13 percent of its assets as of the end of 1986 were electric.Compustat moved this company from its utility data base to its telecommunicationsdata base in September 1987. Finally, Catalyst Energy Development Corporationwas omitted because it has never paid common stock dividends. The fourth standard provides the Commission the discretion to eliminatecompanies for which data may be unavailable or inappropriate. The Commission will continue using the following screening criteria ineach quarterly calculation to ensure that the data for each company isavailable and that it can reasonably be employed in a mechanical fashionwithout producing distorted or unreasonable statistics. Companies willbe dropped from the sample for the following reasons: (i) The company's common stock no longer is publicly traded due to mergeror other action; (ii) The company has decreased or omitted a common dividend payment inthe current or prior three quarters; or (iii) The Commission determines on a case-by-case basis that some otheroccurrence causes the dividend yield for that company to be substantiallymisleading and to bias the resulting quarterly average.\46\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ A list of the utilities excluded from calculation ofthe base year dividend yield appears in Appendix E. The first screen ensures data availability. If a company is no longer publiclytraded, it will not have a current market price (and yield). The seondscreen eliminates companies for which data would probably be inappropriatein a constant growth DCF model. The third screen provides the Commissionthe further discretion to eliminate atypical companies, if necessary. EEI comments that the exclusion from the dividend yield computation ofcompanies which reduced or omitted their dividend payments because of financialdifficulties (the second screening criterion) causes the average cost ofcommon equity to be understated because the sample is not representativeof the entire industry.\47\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ EEI, Appendix A at 3. It is interesting to note that while EEI suggests that the eliminationof the riskiest companies through the sampling procedure will lead to adownwardly biased result, Cooperatives argue that the potential existsfor an upwardly biased result through exclusion of diversified firms, withassumed lower dividend yields, from the dividend yield calculation andinclusion of those same firms, with their assumed higher expected growthrates, in the growth rate sample. FA Staff makes a somewhat similar pointin suggesting that a number of reputedly diversified companies be eliminatedfrom the sample. Although the Commission concurs in theory with EEI that all companies shouldbe included in the sample, it finds that the effects of excluding somerisky companies are mitigated by the other screens used by the Commission,as well as by the use of a median dividend yield.\48\<NOTE/> Moreover, the number of companies excluded still representsa small segment of the industry. For the foregoing reasons, the Commissionfinds that the sampling procedure adopted will result in a group of companiesthat is reasonably representative of the electric utility industry.\49\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ 52 FR at 17, 51 FR at 352.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Those companies which were excluded from the sample becauseof a recent reduction or omission of their dividends presumably would notbe subject to application of the benchmark rate of return. The North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation, <T3>et al. </T3>(Cooperatives) suggest that the sample of utilities usedto estimate the dividend yield term be the same group of companies usedto estimate the long-run expected growth rate in order to avoid potentialmismatching of dividend yields and growth rates. They maintain that ifthis is not done, the rate of return would be upwardly biased by excludingdiversified utilities (which typically have lower than average dividendyields and higher than average growth rates) from the calculation of theindustry dividend yield but including them in the determination of theindustry growth rate. CPC also criticizes the Commission's use of two independentsamples to determine dividend yields and growth rates.\50\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ Cooperatives at 75-78, and CPC at 3. The Commission is not persuaded that the potential magnitude of the biasalleged by Cooperatives and CPC warrants a change in the Commission's positionthat there should be no requirement that the sample of companies used toestimate the growth rate conform to the sample of companies used to calculatethe dividend yield. The assumption, of course, is that the growth ratesample is sufficiently broad-based to be representative of the industry.Commenters should be able to rely on the best available industry data inconducting their analyses. If the Cooperatives believe that the approachthey suggest will lead to more accurate results, they are, or course, freeto submit such an analysis in future proceedings. The Cooperatives would go further and eliminate those utilities which hadbeen expected to reduce dividends during the prior twelve months on theground that investors anticipate dividend reductions and bid down the pricesof the stock prior to the official announcement of dividend reductions.\51\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Cooperatives at 74-83. The Commission believes that the exclusion from the sample of firms expectedto reduce their dividends would be somewhat premature and speculative.It is the policy and practice of the Commission to exclude companies onlywhen obvious error or bias would result from their inclusion. The existenceof a high dividend yield may portend a short-term aberration, but it mayalso reflect high capital costs and the Commission would prefer to waitfor actual adverse dividend actions before excluding a firm. In any event,concern for such outliers is mitigated by the use of the median as themeasure of the average.\52\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ 50 FR at 21813. The Financial Analysis Branch of the Commission's Office of Electric PowerRegulation (FA Staff) proposes to eliminate from the industry sample anadditional 29 companies which have begun to diversify into unregulatedbusinesses. Its rationale is that diversified companies have a differentrisk profile than firms which are solely regulated utilities because diversifiedcompanies as a group have lower dividend yields, higher expected earnedreturns and, therefore, higher price-to-book ratios. It suggests that thelower dividend yields of diversified companies are due to increase retentionratios in order to put more money into diversification efforts. In thealternative, FA Staff suggests that, should the Commission choose not toaddress the diversification issue in this proceeding, it monitor the effectsof diversification on the industry average cost of equity in future proceedings.\53\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ FA Staff at 1, 12. Although FA Staff's data show some divergence between diversified and non-diversifiedutilities in dividend yields, expected earned returns, and price-to-bookratios, they also show that the costs of equity for the two groups currentlyremain very close.\54\<NOTE/> Nonetheless, the Commission agrees that diversification isan increasingly important factor in the electric utility industry and theCommission intends to continue to monitor its effects on the industry averagecost of equity in future proceedings. The Commission believes that itspresent sampling procedures regarding diversified firms are adequate.\55\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ FA Staff at 12-14.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ 51 FR at 351 at fn. 65.The Cooperatives also suggest that the electric utility industry is significantlysegmented between nuclear and non-nuclear groups. It offers statisticaldata showing that the non-nuclear group has lower twelve-month averagedividend yields (by 150 basis points during the period ended June 30, 1987),higher retention ratios and retention growth, higher median stock financinggrowth, and therefore a lower cost of equity (10.61 percent compared to11.52 percent over the same period).\5\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ Cooperatives at 107-115. The issue raised by the Cooperatives regarding the nuclear-nonnuclear segmentationhas been raised before. \5\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission's response remains that benchmark rates ofreturn are currently advisory only and there is no presumption that theyare applicable to any segment of the industry. Moreover, despite the Cooperatives'statistical results,\5\\8\<NOTE/> the Commission believes that the industry-average benchmarkis useful as a point of departure in individual rate cases. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ See, <T3>e.g., </T3> 52 FR 14 at fn. 32. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ As discused <T3>infra, </T3> the Commission modifies the growth rate analysis doneby the Cooperatives so that these results can not be taken as conclusiveon the issue of the distribution of costs in the electric utility industry.D. Dividend Yield The Commission adopts the dividend yield policy used in the earlier proceedings,as proposed. Under this policy, the dividend yield used in the DCF modelis the median of the dividend yields of those companies that remain inthe sample after application of the screening criteria described above(median yield).\5\\9\<NOTE/> The quarterly dividend yield for each company will be computedby dividing the dividend rate by the price. The dividend rate is the ``indicateddividend rate,'' which is the last declared quarterly dividend times four.The price is the simple average of the three monthly high and low pricesfor the quarter. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ <T3>See. </T3>Order No. 420, 50 Fed. Reg. at 21,812; Order No. 442, 51FR at 352-353, Order No. 461, 52 FR at 17-18. The dividend yield for the base year is the average of four quarterly medianyields. The dividend yield used in the quarterly indexing procedure willbe the average of two quarterly median yields. Most commenters use the method proposed by the Commission to compute thedividend yield and do not raise significant objections. EEI, however, identifiesthe use of the median dividend yield rather than the arithmetic mean asa technical problem with the Commission's methodology. Specifically, EEIobserves that because the distribution of electric utility dividend yieldshas been consistently skewed to the right (<T3>i.e.,</T3> there are more ``outliers'' with high dividend yields thanwith low dividend yields), the arithmetic mean is higher than the medianof the distribution. EEI claims that the Commission's use of the mediandividend yield rather than the mean causes the resultant rates of returnto be systematically understated. EEI's proposed alternative to the medianis to eliminate ``outliers'' beyond three standard deviations from thearithmetic mean and to use the resulting arithmetic mean as a measure ofthe dividend yield for the average utility. In defense of its proposal,EEI argues that the Commission has instituted a ``screening process'' thatshould eliminate most, if not all, utilities with unusually high dividendyields based on special circumstances, particularly those utilities whichhave omitted or recently reduced their dividends. EEI suggests that becauseof the screening process the ``need for control of the impact of extremevalues by using the median dividend yield is substantially reduced.''\6\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ EEI at 32-33. EEI further supports its proposed use of the arithmetic mean by arguingthat the risk differential procedure the Commission proposes for individualrate cases depends on a comparison of the subject utility with the ``averageutility'' based on the arithmetic mean of company-specific data for variousmeasures of risk. EEI argues that to be consistent the Commission shouldalso compute its benchmark rate of return on the basis of the arithmeticmean of the dividend yields. In evaluating alternative measures of the average dividend yield in a previousproceeding the Commission found   that: \6\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ Order No. 420, 50 FR at 21,814.<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * the appropriate measure of the average should be a rate thatis reasonable for the greatest number of companies. Using such a measureshould minimize the number of times a utility or its customers will arguefor a rate other than the benchmark because the utility is significantlymore or less risky than average.</ITAG>The Commission found that, of the alternative measures proposed, includingthe arithmetic mean, the median best met this requirement.\6\\2\<NOTE/> It also found that the median was the measure least affectedby the existence of extreme values in the data.\6\\3\<NOTE/> EEI has not convinced the Commission that these conclusionare wrong. Moreover, the Commission notes that the important property ofthe median is that there will be an equal number of companies above andbelow the median. The mean of a skewed distribution does not have eitherproperty. The Commission's ``screening process'' cited by EEI does noteliminate skewness. Truncating the distribution as EEI suggests, by eliminatingall dividend yield ``outliers'' greater than three standard deviationsfrom the mean would not guarantee the elimination of the skewness. Thearithmetic mean remains a less appropriate measure than the median. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\2\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ <T3>Id.</T3>EEI is under the erroneous impression that the Commission would requirethe use of risk differential analyses containing measures for the ``averageutility'' calculated as an arithmetic mean. The Commission is not requiringany specific form of risk differential analysis. If utilities believe thatusing the arithmetic mean in such analyses would lead to systematicallyunderstated awards, they need not use it. Since there is no requirementto use the arithmetic mean when measuring risk in a risk differential analysis,there is no problem of inconsistency. Cooperatives suggest that, in computing the base year dividend yield, anaveraging period of less than 12 months would better reflect changing marketconditions. They state that the DCF model is a long-run expectations model.Cooperatives suggest that it is often necessary to smooth out short-termdividend yields to reduce the effects of variations which do not reflectinvestors' long-run expectations, but that care must be taken not to oversmooththe spot dividend yields and thereby miss fundamental changes. The Commission believes that an averaging period of twelve months in computingthe base year dividend yield better reflects market conditions. Cooperativeshave previously proposed computing the base year dividend yield over aperiod of less than twelve months.\6\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission continues to reject the use of an averagingperiod of less than one year for computing the base year dividend yield,primarily because the use of a dividend yield over only half of the baseyear will not provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of common equityfor the entire year since the cost during the first half of the year maybe different than that for the second half.\6\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\4\  52 FR at 17.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\5\  52 FR at 17-18.The base year dividend yield using the average of the four quarterly medianyields for the year ended June 30, 1987, is 6.70 percent.\6\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\6\ The median dividend yields for the third and fourthquarters of 1986 and for the first and second quarters of 1987 are 6.33,6.54, 6.54, 7.40 percent, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Appendix B for a list of the companies included in the sampleand the companies excluded in each of the four base year quarters. E. GrowthRate In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to rely on both a fundamental analysisapproach and a two-stage growth model to estimate the expected growth ratein this proceeding.\67\<NOTE/> In a fundamental analysis, the two underlying componentsof growth are evaluated_growth from retention of earnings (br) and growthfrom sales of new common stock (sv).\6\\8\<NOTE/> In a two-stage growth analysis, near-term and long-term growthexpectations are evaluated separately. The Commission also proposed toconsider other data and methods to estimate expected growth as a checkon the reasonableness of the above analyses. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\ 52 FR at 37327. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\ Growth from retained earnings, or internal growth,is a function of the expected return on common equity (r) and the expectedretention ratio (b). Growth from sales of new common stock, or externalgrowth, is a function of how much stock is expected to be sold (s) andat what price relative to book value (v). The formula for estimating thegrowth rate based on such a fundamental analysis is thus: g=br+sv. Eight commenters make growth rate recommendations. These growth rate recommendationsrange from 3.55 percent by the Minnesota Department of Public Service (MINN)to 5.3 percent by Boston Edison Company, <T3>et al. </T3>(BEC). See Table 3. The raw growth rate data relied onby the commenters is presented in Table 4. Based on a review and evlauationof the growth rate analyses submitted by the commenters in this proceeding,the Commission finds the expected growth rate during the base year to be4.34 percent.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Summary of Growth Rate Recommendations </T4><H1>Commenter </H1><H1>Growth rate </H1><H1>Basis for recommendation</H1> <ITAG tagnum="21">Utilities<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Cooperatives recommend 4.02 percent andFA Staff recommends 4.10 percent for its 91-company sample.\69\<NOTE/> The difference in the results is a function of somewhat differentestimates for the four factors: ``b'', ``r'', ``s'', and ``v''. Cooperativesuse an expected return on common equity (r) of 13.89 percent, while FAStaff uses 13.7 percent. For the expected retention ratio (b), Cooperativesuse 27.27 percent and FA Staff uses 27 percent. This leads to a ``br''component of 3.85 percent for Cooperatives and 3.7 percent for FA Staff.Cooperatives estimate the expected growth rate in common equity due tonew stock sales (s) to be 0.50 percent, while FA Staff estimates it tobe 1.2 percent. Finally, Cooperatives use 33 percent for the accretionfactor (v), and FA Staff uses 31.5 percent. Therefore, the ``sv'' componentfor Cooperatives is .17 percent and for FA Staff it is .4 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ Cooperatives at 92 and FA Staff at 12-14. The Commission's finding with respect to the expected growth rate givesconsiderable weight to the analyses submitted by Cooperatives and FA Staff.As noted above, both rely on a straightforward fundamental analysis andarrive at similar conclusions. The Commission believes that there is littlebasis for preferring one analysis over the other. Nonetheless, some modificationof these analyses is appropriate to recognize that base year data or near-termestimates are not always the best proxies for investors' long-term expectations.While the Commission believes that the estimates of ``r'' and ``s'', althoughsomewhat different from one another, are reasonable, some comment is inorder regarding the estimates of ``b'', the retention ratio, and ``v'',the accretion factor.The Commission has previously noted that the selection of the retentionratio can have a substantial impact on the end result of a fundamentalgrowth analysis.\70\<NOTE/> In the last two proceedings, the Commission has found that28-32 percent represented a reasonable range of projected retention ratesand used 30 percent in its own calculations.\71\<NOTE/> In this proceeding, evidence suggests that the dividend payoutratio has risen recently and that a ratio above 70 percent is projectedfor the near-term future. Indeed, the analyses of both Cooperatives andFA Staff incorporate retention rates lower than 28 percent. However, theCommission believes that, despite recent data and near-term expectationsfor the dividend payout ratio, the evidence is not persuasive that investorshave long-term expectations that deviate significantly from the 70 percentratio the Commission has adopted in the last two proceedings.\72\<NOTE/> As a result, the Commission will continue to use 70 percentas its best estimate of investors' expectations of the industry averagedividend payout ratio over the long-term.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ 50 FR at 21,819.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ 52 FR at 22.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>BEC at Appendix 6 and EEI at Appendix 6, showing dividendpayout ratios that have moved above and below 70 percent over the lastten years.The Commission's belief that it would not be reasonable for investors toexpect a price-to-book ratio over the long-term to approximate the highlevel achieved during the base year has a similar, although offsetting,effect. Nonetheless, the analyses of both Cooperatives and FA Staff incorporatesuch an assumption in estimating the ``v'' factor. A more reasonable assumptionis that the industry expects to earn a return on common equity above thecost of equity over the near-term, thus accounting for the relatively highmarket-book ratio, but that it expects that the market prices of electricutility securities should move closer to book value over the long-termas expected earned returns of electric utilities correspond more closelyto the cost of capital. The best evidence that the Commission can findin the record regarding the expected price-to-book ratio is the 1.31 usedby both BEC and EEI in performing their projected fundamental growth analyses.\73\<NOTE/> That number is based on the product of Value Line's projectionsof a 9.5 price-earnings ratio and a 13.8 percent return on average commonequity for the 1989-1991 period.\74\<NOTE/> When the modified data is incorporated into the analysesdone by Cooperatives and FA Staff and the two results are averaged, theaverage growth estimate is 4.34 percent.\75\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ BEC at 22 and EEI at Attachment A13.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ The 13.8 percent return on average common equity usedby BEC and EEI is also the average of the 13.7 percent used by FA Staffand the 13.87 percent used by Cooperatives.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ For purposes of calculating the flotation cost adjustment,<T3>infra, </T3>the Commission finds that an ``s'' factor of .85 percent,based on an average of the estimates made by Cooperatives and FA Staff,is reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="24">g=b</ITAG>andmultiply;r+sandmultiply;v<ITAG tagnum="26">FA Staff: g=(.30) (13.7)+(.012)(.237)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">g=4.11+.28=4.39</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Cooperatives:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">g=(.30) (13.87)+(.0050)(.237)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">g=4.16+.12=4.28</ITAG>In arriving at its growth rate recommendation of 5.3 percent, BEC usesa fundamental growth analysis, as well as historical and projected data.Based on a 90-company sample, BEC calculates that the median 5 and 10-yearhistorical growth rates in earnings and dividends were from 4.8 percentto 5.6 percent.\76\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ BEC at 7.In its base year fundamental analysis, BEC calculates growth from retainedearnings (br) to be 4.2 percent and growth from common stock sales (sv)to be .7 percent, giving a growth rate estimate of 4.9 percent.\77\<NOTE/> The variables used in the analysis generally were calculatedfrom data during the base year ending June 1987. BEC also did an analysisof projected fundamental growth. For the ``br'' component, BEC used 5.1percent based on Value Line 1989-1991 projections of ``percent retainedto common equity'' for the Electric Utility Industry Composite. For the``sv'' component, BEC arrived at 0.1 percent, giving a projected growthestimate of 5.2 percent.\78\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 13-16.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 16-23.The ``s'' factor used was 0.5, based on a judgmental adjustment of ValueLine projections of 0.1 percent. The ``v'' factor (1-[1/(P/B)]) used was0.237, based on a Value Line 1989-1991 projection of 1.31 for the price-bookratio (calculated by multiplying the projected return on average equityof 13.8 percent by the projected price-earnings ratio of 9.5.) Thus, sv=.0050andmultiply;0.237or 0.1 percent.BEC also looked at near-term growth rate forecasts of earnings and dividendsmade by various analysts and investment advisory services: Value Line (3.62-4.25percent), Merrill Lynch (3.6-3.7 percent), I/B/E/S (4.0 percent) and SalomonBrothers (5.0 percent). BEC concludes that the low end of this range wouldproduce an unreasonable cost of equity and that investors would not relyupon such projections.\79\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 24-25.Given the relative comparability of its base year fundamental growth estimateof 4.9 percent and its projected fundamental growth estimate of 5.2 percent,BEC initially reasons that a two-stage growth analysis is unnecessary.However, for purposes of considering the more pessimistic outlook reflectedin analyst forecasts, it computes a two-stage growth rate of 4.7 percentby assuming that investors expect growth to decline from a current 5.0percent to 4.5 percent after five years and to remain at that level thereafter.\8\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\0\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 25-28.Based on the data sources examined and growth analyses performed, BEC concludesthat a range of 4.7-5.3 percent is reasonable for the electric utilityindustry.\8\\1\<NOTE/> Subsequently, however, BEC effectively recommends the upperend of this range because of three factors that it believes should be takeninto account. First, some of the riskiest companies were excluded fromthe sample. Second, the use of a mean dividend yield, rather than the median,may have produced a higher result. And third, several companies in thesample were experiencing depressed growth periods because of dividend cutsand the prospect of dividend restorations had not been fully captured inits analysis.\8\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\1\<T3>Id.</T3> at 28-29<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\2\<T3>Id.</T3> at 37-38.The Commission finds that BEC's growth rate recommendation is somewhathigh for several reasons. More weight is given to historical growth ratesthan warranted. While historical growth rates do provide a reference point,the Commission agrees with Cooperatives that additional analyses are neededbefore it can be concluded that investors expect the future to replicatethe past. Although BEC attempts to bolster the use of historical growthrates, its reasoning is not persuasive. For example, it points to a decliningpayout ratio as offsetting increasing returns on equity in past years.Recently, however, returns have declined and payout ratios have risen from1986 levels. The Commission believes that these changes would cause investorsto be very cautious about extrapolating past growth rates into the future.The appropriations of such investor caution can be shown in another way.If investors were actually expecting a long-term growth rate of 5.3 percent,what rate of return on common equity would this imply? If the growth fromnew stock sales is expected to be relatively modest over the foreseeablefuture, as most commenters seem to agree, the industry would be expectedto earn a return on common equity above 15 percent. In fact, assuming adividend payout ration of 70 percent, the payout adopted by the Commissionin this proceeding, the expected return on common equity would be 17 percent,<T3>i.e.</T3>, given g=br, (and assuming sv=.2, the average of the findingsof Cooperatives and FA Staff) then 5.1=3r and r=17.0 percent. Because earnedreturns and interest rates in general have declined since last year, theCommission does not find such investor expectations to be plausible forthe long-term.The Commission also has problems with BEC's dual analysis based first onbase year and then on projected data. The attractiveness of the fundamentalgrowth analysis is that it enables one to look individually at the componentsof expected growth: ``b'', ``r'', ``s'', and ``v''. For each component,the task is to make a best estimate of what investors expect the valueto be. In some cases, that best estimate may be a function of base yeardata. In other cases, projected data may be more reasonable to use. Withoutexplaining why, BEC goes about mechanically first applying base year datato obtain one estimate (4.9 percent) and then projected data to obtainanother estimate (5.2 percent). It is unclear to the Commission why thefactor inputs to those two analyses need to be kept separate. One fundamentalgrowth analysis should be enough.When computing the ``sv'' component in the first analysis, BEC merely extrapolatesbase year data on the market-book ratio and other primarily historicaldate from EEI and Value Line on the growth rate of aggregate common equity.When computing the ``sv'' component in the second analysis, BEC concedesthat something more than mere extrapolation is required: ``the sv termmust not be mechanically input into the DCF equation but must be evaluatedto determine to what extent investors expect external growth, either positiveor negative, to continue in the future.'' \8\\3\<NOTE/> In its first analysis, BEC gets 0.7 percent and in the secondanalysis, it gets 0.1 percent. The Commission is unable to determine whichestimate of ``sv'' BEC favors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\3\ BEC at 19.With respect to the ``br'' component, BEC computes 4.2 percent in its baseyear analysis by multiplying the realized returns on common equity duringthe base year by the actual retention ratios. Depending on the facts andcircumstances, one might argue that the base year data for the industryis a best estimate of what investors expect in the future. Instead, BECuses projected Value Line data for ``br'' and arrives at a 5.1 percentestimate. Again, the Commission cannot determine which estimate BEC considersthe best. Based on the same kind of analysis it performed above regardinghistorical growth rates, the Commission is skeptical about the reliabilityof the 5.1 percent number, particularly when Value Line reports ``br''data in the aggregate and it is not possible to discern what ``b'' and``r'' terms were used.Interestingly, the Value Line projected data can be used to derive the``br'' component by looking at ``b'' and ``r'' separately, and BEC usedmost of this data in computing a projected price-to-book ratio.\8\\4\<NOTE/> BEC calculated a projected return on average equity of 13.8percent from Value Line data and noted that Value Line projected the price-earningsratio for the industry to be 9.5. Value Line also projects the dividendyield to be 7.5 percent.\8\\5\<NOTE/> The product of these two variables gives the dividend payoutratio, <T3>i.e.</T3>,<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\4\ BEC at 22.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\5\ See FA Staff at Attachment E.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">P/Eandmultiply;D/P=D/E,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">which turns out to be 71.25 percent (9.5andmultiply;.075). Therefore,the retention ratio or ``b'' is .2875. Thus, ``br'' is .2875 andmultiply;13.8 or 3.97 percent.Which estimate is better, 5.1 percent or 3.97 percent? They are both basedon projected Value Line data, although the latter estimate allows one tosee the individual ``b'' or ``r'' terms and appraise their reasonableness.The latter estimate is also consistent with the preponderance of the analystforecasts. As a result, if BEC used its projected ``sv'' of .1 percent,and the alternative projected ``br'' of 3.97 percent, it would have arrivedat a growth estimate of 4.07 percent, significantly different from the4.9 percent and 5.2 percent estimates it derived from its two separatefundamental growth analyses.EEI recommends an expected growth rate of 5.1 percent based on a varietyof approaches.\8\\6\<NOTE/> It leans most heavily on base year and projected fundamentalanalyses which yield 5.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. The twofundamental analyses are very similar to those submitted by BEC and theprojected fundamental analysis appears to be identical to BEC's comparableanalysis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\6\ EEI at Attachment A-5.EEI also presents 5 and 10-year historical growth rates in earnings anddividends. The 5-year growth rates range from 3.56-4.61 percent. The 10-yeargrowth rates range from 5.15-5.96 percent. EEI notes, however, that ifa number of utilities which reported negative growth rates were eliminatedfrom the sample, the 5-year growth rates would be at the lower end of therange for 10-year growth rates.EEI relies on analyst forecasts made by Value Line, Merrill Lynch, I/B/E/S,and Salomon Brothers. These range from 3.5 to 5.0 percent, but center generallyaround 4.0 percent. The two-stage growth analysis relied on by EEI usedan initial growth rate of 5.1 percent, based on its fundamental analysis,and assumed that growth would decline to a constant rate of 4.0 percentafter five years. Using this approach, EEI calculated a composite growthrate of 4.3 percent. EEI argues that both the analyst forecasts and thetwo-stage growth analysis reflect a downward bias since ``analysts appearto have been unduly influenced'' by temporary disruptions in earnings thathave affected some utilities.\8\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\7\ EEI at 18.AUS recommends an expected growth rate of 4.8 percent based on an equalweighing of its two-stage analysis (4.83 percent) and its fundamental analysis(4.77 percent).\8\\8\<NOTE/> The two-stage analysis used data derived from averaging sevenhistorical and forecasted growth rates taken from Value Line and I/B/E/S.The mean of these rates (4.69 percent) was used for the first stage andthe median (4.88 percent) was used for the long-run second stage beginningafter five years. AUS's fundamental analysis was based entirely on retentiongrowth rates projected by Value Line for 1987, 1988, and 1990-1992.\8\\9\<NOTE/> Although AUS does not attempt to specify a particular ``sv''component in its fundamental analysis, it notes that with market-to-bookratios well above one, the ``sv'' component would be positive and thusproduce additional growth.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\8\ AUS at 41-42.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 36-37.New England Power Company (NEP) recommends a growth rate in the range of4.50 to 5.00 percent.\9\\0\<NOTE/> Its analysis includes historical growth rates, a fundamentalanalysis, and earnings projections made by Zacks Investment Research inJune 1987. The median 5 and 10-year growth rates in dividends (for periodsending in 1986) are shown as 5.0 percent and 5.54 percent, respectively.In its fundamental anaysis, NEP calculates the median retention growthrate to be 3.6 percent and the external growth rate to be 0.1 percent,or a composite growth rate of 3.7 percent. The median is 4.0 percent whentotal retention growth is calculated for each company separately. Finally,the projected 5-year earnings growth rates published by Zacks were 3.90percent for the mean and 4.00 percent for the median.\9\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ NEP at Appendix 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ <T3>Id.</T3> at Appendix 2-6.Southwestern Electric Power Service Company (SWEP) recommends a 4.318 percentgrowth rate based on a 60-40 weighing of future projections and historicaldata.\9\\2\<NOTE/> The historical data consists of a fundamental growth rateof 3.14 percent, which was derived from Compustat data for the base year,and 5-year historical growth rates in earnings and dividends publishedby E.F. Hutton of 5.49 percent and 7.83 percent, respectively. The futureprojections are based on 5-year forecasts of earnings and dividends madeby E.F. Hutton of 3.54 percent and 2.84 percent, respectively, and by SalomonBrothers of 4.24 percent.\9\\3\<NOTE/> The criticism that the Commission directed at BEC's analysesis also partially applicable to the analyses submitted by EEI and AUS.\9\\4\<NOTE/> For example, both EEI and AUS draw on the same type of aggregate``br'' data projected by Value Line. As the Commission has said before,the appeal of the fundamental growth analysis is that it allows an evaluationof the individual components that influence growth in earnings and dividends.If one's analysis uses data that precludes this evaluation, it tends toundercut the benefits of the fundamental growth analysis and is thereforedeserving of less weight. This is particularly true when projected dataavailable on an individual basis from the same source produces a much lowergrowth rate from retained earnings, as was demonstrated in the Commission'sdiscussion of BEC's analysis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ SWEP at 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ <T3>Id.</T3> at Exhibit C.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ Although SWEP's growth rate recommendation (4.318 percent)is at the lower end of the range, the Commission cannot give much weightto it. As with MINN's recommendation, the recommendation made by SWEP isbased on an analysis which is little more than a mechanical averaging ofsome historical and projected data, some of which is significantly differentfrom similar data offered by most other commenters and which cannot beverified because the underlying computations were not made available.EEI's fundamental growth analyses were very similar to these of BEC. Indeed,as Table 4 indicates, they both show the same results. Therefore, the Commission'sreservations regarding the nature of BEC's dual fundamental analysis applyto EEI as well.AUS's growth rate recommendation was also based on a simple average offour historical growth rates published by Value Line and three projections_twoby Value Line and one by I/B/E/S. Although such a procedure may be usedas a reference point in a growth rate analysis, the Commission is unableto give it much weight without some explanation of why the averaging ofthese selected numbers is likely to produce the growth rate expected byinvestors.The Commission finds it difficult to square the underlying analysis withNEP's growth rate recommendation of 4.5-5.0 percent. NEP's fundamentalanalysis yields a growth rate of 3.7 percent or 4.0 percent, dependingon the computational procedure used, and these results are essentiallythe same as the five-year earnings forecast made by Zack's Investment Research_3.90percent for the mean and 4.0 percent for the median.\9\\5\<NOTE/> While the 5 and 10-year historical growth rates in dividendsare stated to be 5.0 percent and 5.54 percent, respectively, such historicalrates cannot carry as much weight as results that are the product of amore reasoned analysis. As a consequence, the Commission believes thatNEP's analysis better supports a growth rate recommendation of approximately4.0 percent than one of 4.5-5.0 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ NEP at Appendix 2-3.The Commission also proposed in the Notice to make use of a two-stage growthanalysis. However, the Commission agrees with Cooperatives that it is toodifficult to differentiate meaningfully between the first and second stagesof growth to confidently rely on a two-stage growth analysis in this proceeding.\9\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission notes, however, that this conclusion itselfis derived from a finding that the expected growth rates for the firstand second stages are too close to differentiate.\9\\7\<NOTE/> Therefore, despite NEP's general criticism that it is impracticalto use a two-stage analysis,\9\\8\<NOTE/> the Commission continues to believe that the two-stage approachrepresents a useful analytic tool that can illuminate the growth rate implicationsof near-term and long-term forecasts.\9\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ Cooperatives at 96-97.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ 52 FR 22-23.

Reg. 21 at Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ As it did last year, NEP criticizes the use of a two-stagemodel to estimate growth rates. It believes that such an analysis is onlyuseful when dealing with individual companies having special problems.It also believes that it is probably impossible to conduct accurately atwo-stage analysis of a large group of utilities in a generic context becauseof the added imprecision of estimating first and second-stage growth ratesfor each individual company.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ <T3>Id. </T3>at fn.103.The 3.55 percent recommendation made by MINN is the lowest recommendationmade by the remaining commenters. This estimate is based on a simple averageof the ten-year historical growth rate in dividends (3.2 percent) and earnings(3.6 percent), as well as the mean five-year earnings growth rate of 3.85percent projected by Zack's Investment Research in September 1987.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> In addition to the general shortcoming of giving great weightto an extrapolation of historical growth rates without any explanationas to why investors would expect them to persist into the future, the historicalgrowth rates offered by MINN also deviate significantly from those of allother commenters, as shown in Table 4. As a result, both the nature ofthe analysis and the unexplained and unusually low historical growth ratesrequire that the Commission give little weight to MINN's growth rate recommendation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ MINN at 3. If the growth rate estimates of BEC and MINN are excluded, the range ofremaining growth rate recommendations narrows to 4.02 percent (Cooperatives)to 5.1 percent (EEI), or a bit over 100 basis points. Reasonable peoplemay differ as to the weight to be given to particular analyses and resultswith this range. However, based on its evaluation of the analyses submittedin this proceeding, the Commission is persuaded that the growth rate expectedby investors falls within the lower part of the 4.02-5.1 percent range.Specifically, as discussed above, the Commission finds the expected growthrate in this proceeding to be 4.34 percent, based primarily on a modifiedversion of the fundamental growth analyses submitted by Cooperatives andFA Staff. F. Corroborative Evidence <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>Although few commenters offered corroborative evidence, most of those thatdid used some kind of risk premium approach. The Commission reviews thisevidence and other publicly available data below. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Risk Premium Analyses </ITAG>Three commenters offer the risk premium approach to cost of common equitydetermination for corroborative purposes.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> AUS calculates that the yield on Moody's A-rated public utilitybonds averaged 9.36 percent for the twelve months ended June 30, 1987.Noting the trend in interest rates since the end of the study period andprojections made by economic forecasters, AUS concludes that a ten percentyield on long-term public utility bonds would be ``conservative in thecontext of a risk premium calculated common equity cost rate.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ AUS at 43-54; BEC at 40-43; NEP at 7. Although AUS presents the results of seven risk premium studies, its conclusionsare largely based upon an independent study of the risk premiums applicableonly to electric utilities. For the period 1926-86, AUS calculates therisk premium (using annual holding period returns) of electric utilitycommon equities over public utility bonds, to be 4.03 to 5.88 percentagepoints, depending on the measurement technique applied. For the 1952-86subperiod, the risk premiums range from 5.60 to 7.01 percentage points.AUS concludes that the appropriate risk premium for electric utilitiesis at least four percentage points. When added to the 10 percent long-termdebt attraction rate projected by AUS, a 14 percent cost of common equityis produced. Whereas AUS utilizes risk premium data as much as sixty years old, BECuses more contemporary data in its risk premium analyses. BEC calculatesan equity risk premium as the average difference between the rate of returnallowed electric utilities on common equity, as reported in Salomon Brothersand Value Line publications, and each utility's July 1987 bond yield. Themedian risk premiums are about 5.25 percentage points using the allowedreturns on equity reported by Salomon Brothers, and about 5.3-5.5 percentagepoints, using Value Line data. Noting that some of the allowed returnson common equity were granted several years ago, when capital costs werehigher, BEC arbitrarily reduced the equity risk premium to four percentagepoints, which, when added to the 9.36 percent average yield of A-ratedpublic utility bonds over the base year, produces a risk premium-basedcost of equity of 13.36 percent. NEP uses the risk premium approach to calculate the cost of common equityin two ways. NEP first calculates for each electric utility, for each yearfrom 1977 to 1986, a risk premium which is the difference between the yieldto maturity of a selected bond in June of each year, and a DCF estimateof the cost of common equity. The DCF growth factor is the ten-year leastsquares growth rate in dividends declared per share. Adding the ten-yearaverage 2.68 percentage point average risk premium so derived to the averageof July 1986 and June 1987 yields to maturity for a bond of each companyproduces an average investors' return requirement of 12.20 percent. NEP also performed a second risk premium analysis, identical to the first,except that yearly growth rate estimates were calculated using the ``internalgrowth'' rate methodology, which is the product of the earned rate of returnon common equity and the earnings retention rate. Adding the ten-year 2.07percentage point average risk premium so derived to the average of July1986 and June 1987 yields to maturity for a bond of each company yieldsan average investors' return requirement of 11.47 percent. The obvious problem with any risk premium approach is that it is very difficultto determine what the risk premium actually is. Not only is it unknown,but it is likely to vary over time as well. Whatever historical relationshipsexisted between debt and equity securities during the past sixty yearsmay no longer exist. There are good reasons to question the stability of long-run risk premiums,especially as applied to recent years. First, electric utilities have experiencedmajor upheavals in the recent past due to OPEC, Three Mile Island, Chernobyland other phenomena. These developments have had an impact on the riskof all electric utility investments. The relationship between the riskof utility and all industry bonds has probably changed as well.            Second, as the Commission has stated in prior generic rate of return proceedings,the historical relationship between debt and equity securities changedin 1979 when the Federal Reserve Board changed its policies.\102\<NOTE/> Since then, interest rates have been more volatile. The Commissionbelieves that this change has affected the risks associated with long-termbonds more than it has those related to common stock. Therefore, currentrisk premiums are likely to be less than previous ones.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ <T3>See, e.q., </T3>Order No. 420, 50 FR at 21822.Third, both <T3>ex post </T3>and <T3>ex ante </T3>public utility common stock and bond returns comprisea variety of components, including: anticipated and unanticipated inflation;the risk of default; duration; interest rate risk; business risk; callprotection (in the case of bonds); liquidity risk and purchasing powerrisk.\103\<NOTE/> These risks directly affect capital costs for both commonstocks and bonds. As economic conditions change, so does the impact ofdifferent risk components.\104\<NOTE/> Therefore, in the Commission's opinion, long-term risk premiumstudies, which reflect an average distribution of the risks just enumerated,do not necessarily provide risk premiums which are applicable to the currentenvironment.\105\<NOTE/> The use of an equity risk premium which is based on realizedholding period returns for an extended historical period cannot be acceptedat face value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 21,821.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ For example, during recessionary periods investors becomevery concerned with default risk, often to the detriment of other riskfactors. During difficult business periods, investors are quite sensitiveto the fact that bond investors have priority over common shareholdersin case of liquidation, and some bonds are more risky than others. Duringmore prosperous times, these concerns may fade as investors concern themselveswith the other risk components which impact their investment decisions.During stock market panics, such as occurred on October 19 and 20, 1987,investors' most immediate concerns are with liquidity risk.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ In the Commission's view it is still an open questionwhether the yield on long-term bonds can ever exceed that of common stock;the Commission can only recognize that stock and bond investors shoulderdifferent risks, in different proportional amounts, at various times.In addressing the specifics of AUS's analyses, the Commission notes thatthe risk premiums were calculated over a sixty-year historical period.For this reason alone, they are suspect. Moreover, the Commission is comfortablewith the notion that risk premiums generally tend to decline in periodsof high interest rates, and <T3>vice versa. </T3>During that extended period, the average yield onA-rated public utility bonds was 6.09 percent,\106\<NOTE/> which is significantly lower than the 9.63 percent yieldfor the base year. Therefore, it would be logical to conclude that, evenwere historical risk premiums applicable to contemporary times, an historicalrisk premium so derived is probably somewhat overstated because it correspondsto a lower level of interest rates than currently exist.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ Moody's Public Utility Manual (1986) and Bond Guide(various issues).Even were AUS's risk premiums applicable to a contemporary period, it seemsthat further refinements are required. AUS's risk premiums are based ondifferences in holding period rates of return, which are effective annualrates, not nominal rates such as those on which the Commission's allowanceon common equity is based. For proper comparison, the Commission believesthat the stock and bond holding period rates of return should be convertedto nominal rates so that the resulting difference may be added to the nominalrate in effect during the base period. It would appear that the risk premiumsreported by AUS are overstated by approximately 0.31 percentage pointsdue to this factor.\107\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ 1926-86 annual stock returns=10.82 percent. 1926-82annual bond returns=5.16 percent. Estimated stock quarterly nominal yield=4((1.1082).25^1)=10.41percent. Estimated bond semi-annual nominal yield=2((1.0516).5^1)=5.06percent. The difference is 5.35 percent, which is .31 percentage pointsless than the 5.66 percent calculated by AUS.The Commission is also not convinced that BEC's approach to the determinationof a risk premium is useful. BEC's calculation of risk premiums reliesprimarily upon the reported allowances on common equity for individualelectric utilities. The Commission notes the inherent circularity of BEC'sanalysis; <T3>i.e., </T3>BEC would have the Commission base its equity allowanceon previously-approved equity allowances. This would shift the Commission'sresponsibility for setting just and reasonable rates to the states, whoare largely represented in BEC's analyses. Even were the analyses limitedto Commission equity allowances, the results of such a study would remaininherently circular. For this reason, the Commission rejects BEC's riskpremium analysis.NEP's analyses are the best reasoned of the risk premium studies. Thoseanalyses have as their basis an individual DCF calculation of the costof common equity for each electric utility, for each of ten years. Therefore,acceptance of the validity of the risk premiums so derived (2.68 and 2.07percentage points, an average value of 2.38) rests upon the reasonablenessof NEP's estimates of the cost of common equity, as well as upon the appropriatenessof using ten-year average risk premiums today. With respect to the latterissue, the Commission notes that A-rated public utility bond yields averaged12.33 percent over the period 1977-86, whereas they averaged 9.36 percentfor the base year.\108\<NOTE/> Therefore, NEP's average risk premium of 2.38 percentagepoints might somewhat understate the current premium. Concerning the reasonablenessof NEP's methodologies, the Commission notes that the ten-year least squaresgrowth rate calculations were made during a period when industry averageddividend payout ratios increased and then subsided; therefore the historicaldividend growth rates may not have been sustainable. NEP's earnings retentiongrowth rates also ignore the negative effects of common stock sales belowbook value, which have had the effect of inhibiting book value growth.For these reasons, the risk premiums calculated by NEP tend to be overstated.When both effects are considered, it would appear that NEP's average riskpremium, 2.38 percentage points, represents a reasonable estimate of thecurrent risk premium. When added to the yield on A-rated public utilitybonds of 9.36 percent for the base-period, the estimated cost of commonequity is 11.74 percent. This tends to corroborate the Commission's conclusionin this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ Moody's Public Utility Manual (1986) and Moody's BondSurvey (various issues).While the Commission has concerns with the quantification of specific riskpremiums, it continues to believe that the ranking of securities basedon relative risk provides useful information. Table 5, below, presentsselected interest rates for the base year for this proceeding and for previousannual proceedings. A comparison of these rates to the industry averagerequired rates of return shows premiums that the Commission believes areconsistent over time and consistent across securities based on risk differences.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Selected Interest Rates and Risk Premiums </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Year ending June 30_</H1><H2>1984</H2><H2>1985</H2><H2>1986</H2><H2>1987</H2><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Selected Interest Rates \1\</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury bills: 3 month (new) <D>9.24 </D><D>8.76</D><D>6.82</D><D>5.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury bonds: 10 year constant matur <D>12.11 </D><D>11.75</D><D>9.06</D><D>7.53</D></ITAG>Moody's public utility bonds: <ITAG tagnum="3">Aaa </ITAG><D>12.84 </D><D>12.47</D><D>10.08</D><D>8.69</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Aa </ITAG><D>13.44 </D><D>13.10</D><D>10.45</D><D>9.06</D><ITAG tagnum="3">A </ITAG><D>13.80 </D><D>13.53</D><D>10.81</D><D>9.36</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Baa </ITAG><D>14.41 </D><D>13.96</D><D>11.31</D><D>9.74</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Market required ROE for electric utilities (using 420 model) <D>15.25 </D><D>14.73</D><D>13.02</D><D>11.19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Selected Risk Premiums \2\ </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury bills <D>6.0 </D><D>6.0</D><D>6.2</D><D>5.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury bonds <D>3.1 </D><D>3.0</D><D>4.0</D><D>3.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-rated public utility bonds <D>1.5 </D><D>1.2</D><D>2.2</D><D>1.8</D><F>\1\ Rates are average of monthly rates. </F><F>\2\ Risk premiums are determined by subtracting the average yield forthe specified security from the nominal rate determined from the 420 model.</F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>Generally, as one moves down the list of securities in Table 5, the greaterthe associated risks the higher the required rate of return. While theremay be circumstances in which the relative position of one or more of thesesecurities may change for short periods of time, such circumstances arenot the norm. The relative positions depicted in Table 5 are consistentwith the Commission's understanding of the relative risks of the referencedsecurities: <T3>i.e., </T3>Federal government securities have lower default risk thanpublic utility securities; short-term securities yield less than long-termsecurities; and lower bond ratings imply higher default risk and higherrates of return. In conclusion, the Commission finds no inconsistency between its findingof a market cost of common equity for the base year of 11.21 percent andinterest rates for the same time period. The implied risk premiums, whilesmaller than long-term historical data would suggest, appear very plausible,especially in light of the changed relationship between debt and commonstock since 1979. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Market-to-Book and Earnings-Price Ratio Evidence </ITAG>FA Staff evaluates the expected earned rate of return on common equitywith reference to the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. When the P/B ratio isabove one, FA Staff states that the expected earned rate of return on commonequity overstates the cost of common equity, and <T3>vice versa. </T3>Using this reasoning, FA Staff argues that its estimateof the expected earned rate of return on common equity of 13.70 percent,together with the base-year P/B ratio in excess of unity (1.46), is consistentwith its cost of common equity finding of 10.98 percent.\1\\0\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\9\ FA Staff's discussion used numbers from the 62-utilitysubgroup, which excluded diversified utilities. The Commission has heresubstituted data from its 91-utility group. FA Staff also looked at the relationship between the market cost of commonequity and earnings-price (E/P) ratios. FA Staff states that when the price-to-bookratio is above one, the E/P ratio understates the market cost, and <T3>vice versa. </T3>FA Staff estimates that the E/P ratio is 9.38 percentfor the base period, a finding which it claims is also consistent withits P/B ratio and its cost of common equity. Cooperatives took the E/P ratio analysis one step further, arguing thatthe precise amount by which the E/P ratio overstates or understates themarket cost of common equity is equal to: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p7,7/1,g1,t1,s10,1,25</C> <H1>Growth rate in Total common, Common equity </H1><H1>x</H1><H1>1_Price-to-Book Ratio </H1><H2>Price-to-Book Ratio</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> Estimating the price-to-book ratio for the base period to be 1.49 and thegrowth rate in total common equity to be 4.76 percent, Cooperatives calculatethe understatement to be 1.57 percentage points. Cooperatives then addthis to their calculation of the industry average E/P ratio of 9.21 percentto obtain an adjusted yield of 10.78 percent, thereby corroborating theirDCF cost of capital estimate of 10.85 percent. FA Staff's presentation in this proceeding is substantially similar tothose filed in the three earlier annual proceedings.\1\\1\\0\<NOTE/> Its analysis is not entitled to great weight because of itslack of precision. If one were to accept FA Staff's presentations at facevalue, they would appear to support nearly any cost of common equity estimatein the range of 9.38 to 13.70 percent. And, the 11.21 percent cost of commonequity found reasonable by the Commission is certainly within that range.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Order No. 461, 52 FR at 24. Cooperatives claim that an adjusted E/P ratio analysis corroborates itscost of capital estimate of 10.87 percent. However, the Commission notesthat Cooperatives' adjusted E/P ratio is merely a derivative of the discountedcash flow model which uses book value growth, <T3>i.e., </T3> the ``k = D/P+br+sv'' model. The presentation is a tautologyin that a minor reformulation of the primary model has been used to demonstratethe validity of the model itself. Therefore, Cooperatives' adjusted E/Panalysis is not useful as corroborative evidence in this proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Interest Coverage Analysis </ITAG>AUS tests the fairness of the rate of return on common equity using aninterest coverage test. AUS calculates that, using industry average capitalstructures outstanding on June 30, 1984, 1985, and 1986, and the genericrates of return in effect at those times, the pre-tax industry interestcoverages were 3.8 times, 3.8 times, and 3.2 times, respectively. AUS alsoshows that, using an estimated equity cost rate of 11.94 percent and incometax rate of 34 percent, the industry average pre-tax interest coveragedrops to 2.9 times on June 30, 1987. AUS argues that it is necessary tohave a 14 percent rate of return on common equity in this proceeding becausethat return would produce a 3.25 times pre-tax interest coverage (whichis the midpoint of the A bond rating criteria).\1\\1\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\1\ AUS at 19-20.The Commission notes that there are three factors which largely determinethe interest coverage factor: (a) The rate of return on common equity;(b) the capital structure ratio; and (c) the income tax rate. Thus, coveragefactor could be increased from 2.9 times to 3.25 times through one of threemeans, or a combination thereof: (a) Increasing the rate of return on commonequity to 14.0 percent, as proposed by AUS; (b) increasing the tax ratefrom 34 percent to 43 percent (a change not within the control of the Commissionor the parties); or (c) increasing the common equity ratio from 42.3 percentto 45.9 percent. If the market perceives the reduction in interest coverages (which areprimarily a consequence of the reduction in the federal income tax rate)\1\\1\\2\<NOTE/> as increasing shareholder risk (as AUS's claims would appearto suggest), then an increase in capital costs should result, and the Commission'smarket-oriented rate of return techniques should capture this change. Tomake a second explicit adjustment to the allowance on common equity, asAUS suggests, might double-count the effects on such a fundamental change.\1\\1\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that it should continue to placeprimary reliance on market-oriented approaches to the determination ofa public utility's allowance on common equity. Results-oriented analyses,such as the pre-tax interest coverage measure, are not dispositive of thedetermination of the rate of return on common equity. Neither are theyuseful for corroborative purposes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\2\ The reduction in the corporate income tax rate aloneaccounts for a decline in the pre-tax interest coverage from 3.4 timesto 2.9 times. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\3\ Utilities could also elect to increase the commonequity ratio, thereby increasing the pre-tax coverage factor. G. FlotationCostsThe Commission adopts the technique used in prior annual proceedings toadjust the required rate of return for flotation costs. Thus, utilitiesare compensated only for issuance costs, such as underwriters' compensationand legal and printing fees, and those costs are reflected in an industryaverage adjustment to the market required rate of return.The following formula determines an increment to the cost of common equitywhich reflects the average annualized amount of flotation cost incurredby the utility industry:\1\\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\4\ Order No. 461, 52 FR at 25-26.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s10,6,6,r10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>k*=</H1><H1>fs</H1><H2>(1+s)</H2><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">k*=flotation cost adjustment to required rate of return</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">f=industry average flotation cost as a percentage of offering price</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">s=proportion of new common equity expected to be issued annually tototal common equity</ITAG>Commenters' estimates for ``f'', average flotation cost as a percentageof offering price, range from 2.40 to 2.87 percent, with the exceptionof EEI's 3.66 percent.\1\\1\\5\<NOTE/> EEI's estimate is atypical, largely due to the company sampleused in its analysis.

Several commenters argue that the Commission shouldnot extend the rate of return concept to section 206 proceedings becauseof the differences between section 205 and section 206 proceedings.\123\<NOTE/> Commenters argue application of a generic rate of returnwould shift the burden of proof,\124\<NOTE/> abrogate existing contracts on insufficient grounds,\125\<NOTE/> increase litigation expenses,\126\<NOTE/> and heighten uncertainty over prevailing rates.\127\<NOTE/> Commenters discuss whether the benchmark rate in section206 proceedings should be a rebuttable presumption or advisory only.\128\<NOTE/> Finally, commenters criticize the proposed use of the benchmarkrate of return in effect at the time of the final Section 206 decisionand offer various alternatives.\129\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\ EEI at 23.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ BEC at 14, CGE at 4, EEI at 24, and NEP at 4-5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ BEC at 15-16.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ Southern at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ CGE at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ NEP at 5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ BEC at 18, EEI at 25-26, and NEP at 5.Most of the comments on this issue are based on a misunderstanding of theproposal. The commenters' arguments reflect an erroneous presumption thatthe Commission intended the benchmark to be used as a rebuttable presumption.The list of disadvantages cited by commenters would be relevant concernsonly if the generic rate were to be a rebuttable presumption. In fact,the Commission intended that the generic rate be advisory only. Therefore,in practice, a complainant in a section 206 proceeding will have to provethat the challenged rate is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory,or preferential in light of the circumstances of the particular utility.However, the participants in the proceeding may introduce the applicablegeneric rate of return as evidence of the industry average rate. The genericrate of return will not be conclusive evidence, but will merely supplementthe specific showing now required. The Commission expects to apply thegeneric rate of return where appropriate, but is mindful that decisionsin individual cases must be supported as if the generic rate of returnhad not been established.The Commission believes that commenters have failed to identify significantdifferences between section 205 and 206 proceedings. In fact, the Commissionbelieves that the similarities between section 205 and 206 proceedingsoutweigh the differences. Both proceedings involve a determination by theCommission of whether rates, changes, rules and regulations set by publicutilities for jurisdictional transmission or sale of electric energy areor are not just and reasonable; and, in each, the availability of a genericrate would be useful as a indication of the industry average and as a devicefor narrowing differences among parties. Therefore, the Commission is convincedthat it is appropriate to apply the generic rate of return to both proceedingson an advisory basis.As to the particular benchmark rate to be used in FPA section 206 proceedings,the Commission is persuaded by the comments to apply the benchmark rateof return in effect on the date the Commission sets a rate for investigationunder FPA section 206.J. Frequency of ProceedingIn the NOPR, the Commission proposed to amend the existing regulation,which requires an annual proceeding to determine a benchmark rate of returnon common equity for the jurisdicational operations of public utilities,to require that those proceedings be conducted as needed, but not moreoften than annually. The Commission expressed its belief that annual proceedingsare unnecessary, since industry average growth rates and flotation costadjustments appear to fluctuate over a very small range. However, the Commissionalso proposed to initiate proceedings to determine benchmark rates on itsown motion or upon motion by any person that shows changed circumstancessufficient to warrant modification of one or more parameters of the quarterlyindexing procedure in effect. Since the ``parameters'' of the DCF modelconsist of the dividend yield and growth rate (plus flotation costs) andthe dividend yield is already adjusted automatically through the quarterlyadjustment mechanism, ``changed circumstances'' would generally be a changein the sum of the expected growth rate and flotation costs.Commenters focus on two principal issues, the continued need for an annualproceeding and implementation of the proposal.Among the general justifications for continuing the annual proceedingsare the benefits of greater accuracy in rate of return decisions becausethe benchmark cannot become ``unduly stale,'' \130\<NOTE/> closer attention to changes in security markets and the consequentability to respond more quickly to those changes,\131\<NOTE/> and the relatively minimal cost (``resources needed to keepthe benchmark up to date on an annual basis would appear to be extremelysmall.'') \132\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ BEC at 9, NEP at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ BEC at 8.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ <T3>Id.</T3>Several commenters suggest that recent volatility in capital markets generallystrengthens the case for annual proceedings.\133\<NOTE/> EEI suggests that the Commission's ``premise of stabilityin industry average growth rates and flotation costs appears to be basedon limited historical data with uncertain application to the future.''\134\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ EEI at 27, MINN at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 27.The Commission continues to believe that the proposal to hold proceedingsperiodically, but less frequently than annually, may have merit becausethe triggering event for a new proceeding should be actual changed circumstancesin the markets for utility shares rather than the mere passage of time.In this proceeding, the Commission has analyzed data for the year endingJune 30, 1987 in determining the growth rate of 4.34 percent. However,since that data was collected, there has been a period of unusual stockmarket volatility, which has probably had an impact, although not yet quantifiable,on growth rate expectations. Therefore, in order to consider thoroughlythe effects of these events on the cost of common equity and because thegrowth rate using pre-October 1987 data has moved to the margin of thenarrow range is has occupied for the last several years, the Commissionwill hold another annual generic rate of return proceeding and in thatproceeding will decide whether to hold subsequent annual proceedings orto convert to periodic proceedings as proposed in the NOPR in this docket.Also, the Commission notes that in the next proceeding, it may limit itsproposal to a determination of the growth rate and flotation cost to beused in the quarterly indexing procedure.K. Fixed Growth Rate/Flotation Cost ParameterIn the NOPR, the Commission proposed that the parameters of the quarterlyindexing procedure be set based on a combined finding of an industry averagegrowth rate and flotation cost adjustment of 4.6 percent so long as thesum of those two figures is within the range of 4.3 to 4.8 percent. However,the Commission also proposed that it would initiate a new proceeding ifcircumstances changed sufficiently to warrant a modification of those parameters.Commenters criticized the proposal because: (1) The Commission had advancedno convincing rationale for the 4.6 percent figure; (2) the 4.6 percentadjustment is no longer reliable because extraordinarily volatile stockprices may lead to changes in the parameters of the constant growth DCFmodel; (3) use of the 4.6 percent parameter would further rigidify an alreadyoverly mechanical methodology for determining the benchmark rate of return;and (4) locking in a growth rate/flotation cost parameter would reducethe Commission's ability to establish benchmark rates which reflect marketrealities as closely as possible.\135\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ AUS at 57-58, EEI at 29-31, NEP at 6, Cooperatives at105, SWEPCO at 4.Commenters have convinced the Commission that a mechanical test may notbe the best method for determining whether to initiate a new proceeding.Since the Commission will initiate a new proceeding for the year endingJune 30, 1988, the Commission is not establishing a definite growth rate/flotationcost parameter for initiating new proceedings.L. Differential Risk AnalysisIn the NOPR, the Commission reiterated its request that all rate case participants(including trial staff) evaluate the reasonableness of the applicable benchmarkrate of return, in light of the special circumstances of the subject utility.Specifically, the Commission requested that litigants submit substantiveanalyses of the risks of individual utilities <T3>vis-a-vis </T3>the average utility represented through the benchmarkrates of return.Several firms comment on the issue of differential risk analysis. BEC expressesconcern that the NOPR implies a Commission intention to rely on a rebuttablepresumption in favor of the benchmark and to permit deviation from thebenchmark only with a ``significant risk differential'' can be establishedbetween the subject utility and the average utility. BEC then cites numerousadministrative and legal problems with this approach.\136\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ BEC at 19-23.Similarly, AUS comments that a requirement of case-by-case risk differentialanalysis defeats the purpose of establishing an advisory generic rate ofreturn and that there is no consensus in the industry or at the Commissionon the proper methodology for determining differential risks.\137\<NOTE/> EEI also expresses doubts that adequately supportable methodsof measuring risk differentials can be developed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ AUS at 56.Commenters on the issue of differential risk analysis exaggerate the importof the Commission's request in the NOPR that they evaluate the reasonablenessof the benchmark rate in light of the special circumstances of the subjectutility. Individual utilities must, as always, calculate their rate ofreturn based on their particular circumstances and the Commission willcontinue to determine just and reasonable rates based on the facts in eachcase. The benchmark rate merely serves as further evidence of the industryaverage rate and is not the equivalent of a rebuttable presumption. TheCommission does not intend to require a specific risk analysis, but ratherto state that some analysis of factors causing a particular utility's divergencefrom the industry average would be useful to both the Commission and theutility.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act\138\<NOTE/> requires the Commission to describe the impact that a proposedrule would have on small entities or to certify that the rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.In the NOPR, the Commission found that the proposed rule would not imposeany regulatory or administrative burdens on a significant number of smallentities because nearly all the jurisdictional utilities subject to therule are too large to be considered ``small entities'' within the meaningof the Act. No comments were received on this finding and the modificationsadopted in the final rule do not materially affect the earlier conclusion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ 5 U.S.C. 601-12 (1982).Accordingly, the Commission certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Timing of Quarterly Updates and Effective Date of Rule</ITAG>The Commission establishes a procedure which will be used to establishquarterly updates. The benchmark rates of return will generally be publishedon or before the fifteenth of the month following the close of a calendarquarter.The first quarter will run from February 1 to April 30, the second quarterfrom May 1 to July 31, the third quarter from August 1 to October 31, andthe fourth quarter from November 1 to January 31.This rule becomes effective February 1, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 37</ITAG>Electric power rates, Electric utilities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends Part 37, ChapterI, Title 18 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations, </T3>as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
