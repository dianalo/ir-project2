ShererandM;The Delta Logic Division of the Poqet Computer Corp. is preparing a mid-Julyrelease of a product that will allow developers to rapidly createapplications without traditional programming.andM;The product, called Entryway, could bring software development capabilitiesto non-programmers, claimed a Poqet official.andP;  &quot;An analyst who would producea spec for a program and then turn it over to a programming group can[instead] build a prototype, refine the prototype in multiple passes withinthe Entryway environment and turn over a running program,&quot; said John Hiles,vice president and general manager of the Delta Logic Division, in Monterey,Calif.andM;To use Entryway, a developer first designs the user interface (limited tocharacter-mode) by typing onto the screen labels, instructions to users andother text.andP;  The developer then uses menus to place such predefined actionitems as buttons onto the screen.andP;  Next, a script language is used to assignbehaviors to the action items.andP;  For example, a developer could specify abutton to bring up help information.andM;To enhance the application, more technically oriented developers can writetheir own action items in the C language.andP;  For example, if a user needed totranslate data between formats, a data-translation utility could be writtenas an action item.andM;Entryway also includes a debugger, calendar and clock facilities that allowdevelopers to create time-oriented applications (such as a program thatdownloads data from remote sites overnight), and menu-generation,report-writing and forms-management capabilities.andM;Entryway is priced at $795.andP;  Each workstation running completed applicationsrequires a $250 run-time package.andM;Entryway joins a small group of similar tools that are now available,including Matrix Software Technology Corp.'s Layout, Maxem Corp.'s Cause andClarion Software's Clarion Personal Developer.andM;Poqet Computer Corp. can be reached at (408) 373-8688.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
