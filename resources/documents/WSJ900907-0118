It's all part of management's dogged attempt to win thehearts and minds of creditors, who ultimately will decide thefate of Greyhound, currently in the preliminary stages of abankruptcy-court filing.</LP><TEXT>   And with the threat looming of a buy-out bid organized bythe striking Amalgamated Transit Union, there is a sense ofurgency to the company's campaign.   Few took the ATU's buy-out proposal seriously until theunion hooked up with Blackstone Group, a New York investmentbanking firm, on a possible buyout bid. Blackstone, with its$800 million buy-out and investment fund, would add muscle tothe ATU's efforts to wrest control of the company fromChairman Fred Currey, who led a 1987 leveraged buy-out of thebus line, a unit of GLI Holding Inc.   With that in mind, Greyhound is anxious to blunt unionefforts to woo creditors; the company wants to maintain theexclusive right to present a reorganization plan to them.Greyhound's exclusivity rights expire Oct. 2, but the companyisn't expected to file its reorganization plan until earlyNovember. Thus, Greyhound will need creditor support to seekan extension. If creditors refuse, the union -- Blackstonegroup could have an opening to file a competing plan.   &quot;They want to keep control of the case,&quot; Leigh Walzer, ananalyst with R.D. Smith andamp; Co., said of Greyhound. &quot;They arevery concerned.&quot;   Those worries have spawned a concerted effort to portraythe union as a volatile and unreliable business partner. ATUPresident James La Sala may have unwittingly helped thatstrategy along with a recent letter to union members statingthat &quot;we intend to continue this fight for as long as it maytake until it is won or the company is destroyed.&quot;   &quot;They have orchestrated and condoned and led violence totry to enforce economic demands that their employer couldn'tmeet,&quot; Greyhound's Mr. Currey said in an interview. &quot;I thinkthe proposition that investors -- Blackstone or otherwise --would seek to have partnership with them isn't veryprobable.&quot;   Union officials, who have condemned the violence anddenied responsibility for it, say they remain confident andnote that Blackstone Group executives will meet with thepresidents of ATU locals on Sunday to discuss details of apossible joint buy-out bid. But even if a proposal is made,ATU leaders will face the task of undoing the dark image anaggressive Greyhound has been painting of them.   A videotape scheduled for showing to creditors, potentiallenders and the news media details violence during the strikethat began March 2 and includes evidence gathered for a suitGreyhound filed last April against the Amalgamated Council ofGreyhound Local Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.   Filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, the suit seeks $30 million in damages andaccuses the council and various union officials of trying toextort wages and benefits from Greyhound through violence andother disruptive acts.   Employing footage shot by television news crews andGreyhound security personnel, the videotape containssometimes grisly scenes of shootings and assaults, includingone clip of an elderly woman passenger being knocked to theground and bloodied by a man identified as a striker.   Also included are portions of a subpoenaed audio recordingof an early 1990 union meeting in Dallas attended by EdwardStrait, president of the Amalgamated Council. On it, a voiceidentified as Mr. Strait's is heard to comment that threebuses that caught fire on a Greyhound lot in Camden, N.J.,last January, two months before the strike, &quot;got so hot, theyburned up, sitting right in the middle of the lot.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Strait recalled making such commentsbut said he didn't intend to incite violence or indicate thathe knew the source of those fires. &quot;We're not the gangstersand thugs that Fred Currey says we are,&quot; Mr. Strait said.   Greyhound property and personnel have been the targets ofwidespread assaults, shootings and vandalism throughout thestrike. ATU members charged in connection with thoseincidents include Fred Ingram, an Amalgamated Council vicepresident, who faces assault and battery charges in aFayetteville, N.C., county district court trial next month inconnection with an incident there last March.</TEXT></DOC>
