<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-0280 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes the development of an updated 1980 base-year fuelconsumption and air-pollution emissions estimates data base by state.These 1980 base-year data were incorporated into Industrial CombustionEmissions (ICE) model Versions 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. The model is one offour stationary source emission and control cost forecasting models developedby EPA's Air and Energy Engineering Research Laboratory. It projectsair pollution emissions (SO{sub 2}, sulfates, NOx, and particulate matter),costs, and fuel mix for industrial fossil-fuel-fired (natural gas, distillateand residual fuel oil, and coal) boilers by state and year (1980 baseline,1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2030). Model Version 6.0 is availablefor remote terminal access and operation at EPA's National Computer Center.</TEXT></DOC>
