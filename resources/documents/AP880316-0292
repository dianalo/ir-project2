STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States, angry over Europeansubsidies for the Airbus aircraft-manufacturing consortium, isincreasing pressure on Airbus nations to abolish or at least reducethe payments, say diplomatic sources.   ``The Americans at a minimum want the Europeans to give a signalthat they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regardto subsidies,'' an informed diplomatic source, who asked not to beidentified further, said Tuesday.   The United States estimates that the four countries involved inAirbus Industrie _ France, Britain, West Germany and Spain _ havepumped $10 billion into the consortium since it was created 17years ago.   Ministers of the four Airbus countries are to meet with U.S.trade officials in the southern West German resort city ofConstance on Friday to continue discussions on the dispute.   Willy de Clercq, the European Economic Community's externalrelations commissioner, said last week that there was a ``realisticchance'' of settling the dispute, but said EEC governments couldnot entirely renounce state aid payments to Airbus.   He predicted an agreement would require ``further rounds of verydifficult negotiations.''   The United States maintains that subsidies to Airbus are unfairto U.S. aircraft makers in the wide-body, long-haul passenger jetmarket.   The Airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort tradeand are allowed under the civil aircraft provisions of the GeneralAgreements on Tariffs and Trade.   The EEC also contends U.S. aircraft manufacturers long haveenjoyed huge, indirect subsidies through military contracts fromthe Pentagon and millions in government research grants.   The United States has threatened to retaliate against Airbus ifthe negotiations fail, despite a recent decision by the four Airbusministers to have Airbus managers enter into direct negotiationswith McDonnell Douglas Corp. on a possible joint project.   The aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides couldcollaborate on one or more new airplanes. Under the prosposal, thenew aircraft would not compete with existing models.   But diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the movewas unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue.   ``It may well be helpful for Airbus and McDonnell Douglas toagree on a joint project, but that will not solve the core problemof the current subsidies,'' said another diplomatic source, whoalso declined to be identified further.   A spokesman for U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter inWashington declined comment on the upcoming meeting. Yeutter isexpected to attend the talks.</TEXT></DOC>
