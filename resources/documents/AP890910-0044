SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Weather Service is hoping todeliver a blizzard of weather news to clients with completion of itsnew satellite-based weather-wire later this year.   The system that channels weather data and forecasts to news mediaand others across the nation is being speeded up by several hundredpercent, reports Michael Sikorski of the weather service.   Indeed, the satellite service is already running in many areas,although Sikorski admitted some stumbles have occurred in making thechangeover from the slow-speed service first established in the1960s.   Little known to the public, the weather wire allows the NationalWeather Service to send information directly to about 1,500newspapers, news services, radio and television stations and publicsafety agencies across the country.   But the Teletype network's relatively low speed of about sevenletters per second results in a cluttered wire with the increasingamounts of data being collected and reported.   In addition, the rising price of telephone lines had cost agencynearly half its clients in recent years, officials said.   The new satellite system should reduce the cost to $100-$115 amonth per client, Sikorski said, cutting the price of the service toas much as one-third of the past level for many subscribers byreplacing the telephone lines with small satellite dishes.   It also allows faster movement of data, with the report speedingup to print about 480 letters per second.   Satellite service is already available across the 48 contiguousstates and is now being extended to Alaska and Hawaii, said Sikorski.   Problems have occurred in some areas, he confirmed, because ofdelays in delivery of satellite receiving equipment to subscribers.   In Oklahoma, for example, a contract for wire-delivery of theservice expired in July, before all subscribers had satellite dishesinstalled, Sikorski said. He said service should be restored withintwo weeks to affected subscribers in that state.   In addition, said Sikorski, the new system's high speed willallow subscribers access to weather data from across the nation. Theolder wire provided data for the state and area of a subscriber, butnot the national detail that will now be available.   In general each state has one forecast office responsible forissuing reports and warnings and developing forecasts for thatstate, he said. That information is then sent to a satellite, andcomes back down to clients subscribing to the service.   Subscribers will have a terminal allowing them to read all of thestate and national reports, or to code out the ones they do notwant, explained Sikorski. Thus, he said, each subscriber will selectits own service.   Contel ASC of McLean, Va., is the contractor operating the newsystem for the weather service, which is part of the CommerceDepartment. Contel's contract to operate the wire is valued at $12million over a decade.   The weather service offices will continue to have a separatesatellite data system for internal service within the agency. Thatis known as AFOS, which stands for Automated Field Operations andServices.   Before establishment of the weather wire a quarter-century or soago the weather service distributed its information on localtelegraphic systems in metropolitan areas, or simply via telephoneor telegraph to interested persons and news media.   It also provides information directly to the public via NOAAWeather Radio, a network of low-power radio stations blanketing mostof the nation that deliver local forecasts and warnings to listenerswith special radio receivers.</TEXT></DOC>
