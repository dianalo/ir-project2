Domino's Pizza is justtoo much of a potential safety hazard for downtown Lafayette,in the opinion of its city council.   The nation's biggest pizza chain has been under fire inrecent years because of traffic accidents, including a numberof fatal accidents, involving its pizza deliverers. Criticscharge that some of the accidents occurred because thedeliverers were rushing to fulfill the company's 30-minutedelivery guarantee. Domino's guarantees customers a $3 rebateif delivery takes longer than 30 minutes.</LP><TEXT>   Lafayette, an affluent suburb east of San Francisco, isthe first city to refuse to grant a business license to aDomino's franchisee because of the safety issue, according toDomino's. A Domino's franchisee was seeking a license for alocation downtown within 100 feet of two nursery schools, asenior citizens complex and a church.   &quot;We have no prejudice against them whatsoever, but wethink the site they chose would cause a potential safetyhazard,&quot; said Richard Holmes, Lafayette's mayor.   &quot;There's a little twist in each community you go into, butwe've never dealt with anyone as unreasonable as this,&quot; saidDan Gearing, co-owner of the Domino's franchise.   Domino's headquarters, in Detroit, says the deliverers'accidents are the result of driving about 450 million miles ayear, delivering an estimated 275 million pizza pies in wind,snow, sleet and rain. Domino's denies any connection betweenthe accidents -- about 100 last year -- and the company's30-minute delivery guarantee. A company spokesman said heisn't aware of a franchisee ever being turned down because ofthe perception of poor driving habits. Domino's says itencourages franchisees to provide instruction programs thatteach safe-driving techniques to Domino's drivers.   The city did give Domino's a choice: waive the 30-minuteguarantee or relocate the business to the outskirts of town.   Dolly's Pizza, formerly a Domino's is on the city'sfringe, and Cybelle's Pizza operates downtown. Each storeoffers delivery service but neither promises 30-minutedelivery.   But even if the Domino's franchisee waived the guarantee,the city wanted to subject the business to stiff fines fortraffic violations, starting at $250 for the first offense,moving up to $1,000 for the fourth offense. The fourthoffense would also give Lafayette the right to revoke thefranchisee's business license.   Mr. Gearing said he and his partner will confer withDomino's regional office before taking any further action.Mr. Gearing's attorney, Donn Black, thinks there could be ahidden agenda here: the city council may feel Domino's isn'tupscale enough for downtown Lafayette.   Aldine Koreneff, director of the nearby nursery, has madeher feelings known. Not only does she fear for the safety ofher charges, she adds, &quot;I don't even like Domino's Pizza.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
