Possible, but not probable.    Even with 88 million Americans shopping by mail, finding and filling a niche in the marketplace is harder than ever. Rising costs for producing, marketing and mailing catalogs have made start-ups more difficult than ever. That doesn't mean don't try, but it does mean you should go in with your eyes open.    Barbara Burt, for instance, gets to know her customers, their children and their children's children. She has to.    Mrs. Burt is the owner of Telltales, a catalog mail-order company based in Bath, Maine, that sells children's books. She started the company in her garage in 1986 -- with $25,000. She sends her customers books, they write reviews and letters that she includes in the catalog. They send a birth announcement, she makes it Page One in a baby's first book. Parents send in their kids' drawings, she returns them bound in a book.    &quot;We want to create a link with our customers,&quot; says Mrs. Burt, a 32-year-old mother of two. &quot;Otherwise we're just some company sending them junk mail. We want to distinguish ourselves from the pile of mail.&quot;    Apparently Telltales is doing just that. A year ago, it moved into a 1,500 square-foot warehouse above a department store in Bath -- a far cry from the unheated garage outside Detroit where the company first started. Since then, its staff has doubled in size to 12, and Mrs. Burt has reduced her work-week to 50 hours from about 70.    For most catalog companies, however, success -- or even survival -- isn't guaranteed. Some 90% of the hundreds of mail-order businesses that start in somebody's basement or kitchen fail, experts estimate. The competition for the $33 billion a year in catalog sales is growing at a staggering rate, with the number of small mail-order companies up 47% since 1980 to 6,225 in 1986, the latest year for which figures are available.    Although apparel and gift items remain the most popular catalog categories, entrepreneurs have opened catalogs offering the weird and the esoteric in search of the all-important niche.    Take Playful Pet Co., which sells perfume, apparel and even vegetarian snacks for dogs and cats. Or Whittler's Mother Carousel Co. in San Francisco, which will create your very own merry-go-round horse. There's filet mignon from Figi Inc. for $30 a pound. Talking calculators are available from the American Foundation for the Blind. Or consider collectors' paperweights from L.H. Selman Ltd., priced from $50 to $27,000 each.    Even when a successful catalog has a unique niche, calamity can strike. Early Winters Inc., outside Chicago, for instance, was on the cutting edge of the outdoor-sportswear trend. Its sales reached $16 million in 1984. But it grew too fast, and soon its debt outstripped its sales. About a year later it filed for bankruptcy-law protection and is currently operated by another group of investors.    When Mrs. Burt launched Telltales, market research and her own motherhood confirmed what she already knew: Baby boomers like herself were having babies. They wanted good books for their children but didn't know where to find them or what to buy. Thus was born Telltales.    One of the lessons she learned early in business is an old maxim: Time is money. When a printer sent out her second catalog two weeks late, thus cutting her selling season and costing her money, she called a low-level company employee of the printing company in Tennessee to find out why. She is currently preparing next winter's catalog, the company's seventh. &quot;If that happened now, I would get on a plane and go down there and talk to the president of the company,&quot; says Mrs. Burt. &quot;I've learned to be more forceful.&quot;    There have been other lessons along the way. She learned to order customer address labels that peel off. Non-peelable ones make it impossible to read the code beneath them to determine which one of the mailing lists she rents is paying off. Switching to cardboard mailers from cushioned envelopes has reduced postage costs and the number of books damaged in shipping.    When Mrs. Burt, her husband, Richard, an architect, and their daughters moved to Maine in mid-1986, they thought it would be a good place to live, raise their children and work. There's L.L. Bean Inc. just miles away in Freeport, and she believes the giant outdoor company's good reputation rubs off on other mail-order businesses in the state. The location also keeps overhead low. Rent and labor are cheap. Designers, illustrators, photographers and printers for the catalog all can be found nearby.    One drawback of operating her business in such an isolated place, though, is it limits what she hears about new children's books. Still, she has contacts from her pre-motherhood days when she sold college textbooks, edited and reviewed books. She's also an avid reader and gets books and reviews from publishers in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Telltales catalog includes the classic stories, folk tales and even contemporary books about children growing up in welfare hotels.    Financially, Telltales is thriving. Its 1987 sales were $530,000, up from $86,000 a year earlier. And Mrs. Burt expects sales to reach $9 million in 1992. Her father was the company's only major investor -- he loaned her the $25,000 to start Telltales -- until a New York group recently decided to invest $150,000 to help her increase the number of catalogs to four from three a year.    Like Telltales, Royal Silk Ltd.'s entry into mail order in 1978 illustrates some basic considerations a small-business owner must make when starting a catalog company. Royal Silk, of Clifton, N.J., had two advantages, however, that would make its early success a tough act to repeat today. It identified a niche in the market and then filled it with a good value: a $22 blouse made of that most regal of fabrics, silk.    By starting with $30,000 as a direct-marketing advertiser and waiting two years to produce its first catalog, Royal Silk multiplied its advantages. The delay gave it time to build a mailing list, refine its early operation and postpone the average $2 million to $3 million investment needed to start a catalog today. It also had time to ensure its product's quality.    &quot;A beautiful catalog will never make lousy merchandise sell, but outstanding merchandise will always sell,&quot; says Maxwell Sroge, president of Marke/Sroge Communications Inc., a Chicago-based catalog-consulting firm.    The experts say that before mailing a new catalog, a market for the product -- the all-important niche -- must be found. A selling strategy must be developed, and commitment -- another crucial but often-overlooked factor -- must be weighed. Of course, there's also the matter of money, though this shouldn't be at the top of the priority list.    &quot;The difference between success and failure in the mail-order world is merchandising and marketing, the same as in retail,&quot; says Mr. Sroge.    When Ruth M. Owades opened Gardener's Eden Inc. in Boston a decade ago with $200,000, those asked to invest in her gardening-accessories company ignored her.    &quot;Banks and venture capitalists weren't interested,&quot; she says. &quot;In 1978, if it wasn't high-tech, nobody wanted to talk about it.&quot; Investors believed mail order was just a Mom-and-Pop industry before the catalog boom began, she contends. &quot;Now it's big business,&quot; she says.    Gardener's Eden, whose annual sales reached $20 million after four years, is doing fine today, but without Mrs. Owades.    San Francisico-based Williams-Sonoma Inc., the catalog-cookware giant, offered to acquire Gardener's Eden and let Mrs. Owades stay as president of what became its gardening division. She accepted, but soon felt trapped in the corporate environment. She eventually left Williams-Sonoma and now runs her own catalog-consulting company.    &quot;Trying to fit into everybody else's meeting schedule or somebody else's rules for running a business doesn't allow an entrepreneur any real creativity,&quot; she says. &quot;What makes a small business succeed is the challenge for the entrepreneur to be creative.&quot;    ---   Mr. Witcher is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Detroit bureau.    ---                  Building a Catalog Business    Here's what to expect during the start-up years of a mid-size catalog business. This hypothetical example markets fashionable clothing to upscale women age 30-45.    Year 1    The first year includes creative and marketing tests and establishing a customer base. Approximately 1% of those who receive the 500,000 catalogs will respond with an average order of $90, generating sales of $450,000.    -- Catalog development*                    $65,000       (32 page, 4 color, 8 1/2 x 11 size)    -- Printing and mailing                   $270,000       (includes purchase of mailing list)    -- Salaries                               $500,000       (includes marketing, merchandising,        customer service, and telemarketing        people)    -- Cost of merchandise                    $225,000       (typically, 45-55% of sales)    -- Bad debt allowance (2% of sales)         $9,000    Year 2    Increase distribution to 3 million catalogs; expect printing, mailing and personnel costs to increase accordingly.    Year 3    Increase distribution to 5.5 million. As the customer base develops, expect a 3-6% response rate. Break-even at the end of third year.    Year 4    Aim for 10-15% pretax profit.    *Cost continues after first year    Note: doesn't include cost of overhead   Source: Marke/Sroge Communications, 1988</TEXT></DOC>
