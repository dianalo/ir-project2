Sales in the period slightly improved to $16.7 million from $15.9 million a year earlier.    The plastics and insulation concern said its closed Rockwool Industries Inc. plant in Belton, Texas, had 130 employees. Susquehanna said it will continue to operate the Rockwool plant in Alexandria, Va., while seeking buyers for it and the Belton plant.    The company said that after its withdrawal from the mineral wool business, its financial condition and operating results will improve. For all 1986, Susquehanna reported a net loss of $8.8 million on sales of $74.1 million compared with year-earlier net income of $3.8 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $72.8 million. </TEXT></DOC>
