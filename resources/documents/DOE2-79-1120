Scan findings were correlated withthe history, chest radiographic findings, and clinicopathologic diagnoses.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) occurred significantly more oftenwith heterogeneous diffuse uptake than with homogeneous diffuse uptake.Heterogeneous diffuse uptake had an 87% positive predictive value forPCP, which was higher than that of other patterns. Localized pulmonaryuptake was most commonly due to bacterial pneumonia or PCP; ill-defined,perihilar uptake, to cytomegalovirus or PCP; and focal (lymph node) uptake,to tuberculosis or lymphoma. The positive predictive value of any pulmonaryuptake for lung pathology was 93%, and the negative predictive valueof a negative scan was 96%. These findings confirm the utility of galliumscanning in the detection of lung pathology related to acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome, particularly PCP. Furthermore, identification of a diffusepattern may permit the use of a less invasive test more specificallydirected at the confirmation of a diagnosis of PCP.</TEXT></DOC>
