Monks are an influential element of Burmese society. They andactivist students have been in the vanguard of mass pro-democracydemonstrations that began July 23 when 77-year-old Ne Win resignedafter 26 years of authoritarian rule and was replaced by hardlinerSein Lwin.   The nation's railroad workers went on strike last Friday,shutting down the most affordable form of long-distancetransportation and making it difficult to move food into the cities.   Union Burma Airways suspended all domestic and internationaloperations, and bus service was severely reduced. Private buseshave since raised their fares from 8 to 50.   Strikes also closed oil refineries in Syriam across the RangoonRiver and in Mann in central Burma, crippled most factories of theIndustries Ministry and left foreign ships waiting at Rangoon port,officials said.   Gasoline became scarce and its price soared. With most gasstations closed, the black market price rose from about $4.17 to$16.67 per gallon.   That sent people running to buy bicycles, which were sellingtoday at 15 percent above their normal price.   Bicycles imported from Thailand and China sell for about$600-$700 in Burma. Those produced at government-run factories sellfor about $133 but are in short supply, and today the black marketprice jumped to $416.   As part of Burma's continuing turmoil, student leaders on Sundayannounced the formation of a student union. On Monday, dock workerssaid they too had formed a union and 21 elder statesmen announcedformation of a Committee for Democracy.   After Ne Win led the 1962 military coup that ended Burma'sexperiment with democracy, he outlawed all political parties,unions and associations except for the ruling Burma SocialistProgram party. The unions and the new Committee for Democracy areillegal under Burma's present constitution.   Burma's leadership disintegrated following the Aug. 19announcement that civilian lawyer Maung Maung had replaced thehated Sein Lwin as president and head of the sole political party.   Maung Maung's promise of a referendum Sept. 12 that would pavethe way for democracy did not quiet the demonstrations, in whichhundreds of people have died in the past month.   Reports reaching Rangoon Monday said the governments of at leasteight cities have stopped operating and Buddhist monks, residentsand some striking policemen have organized protection of theirneighborhoods. The reports said many offices of the SocialistProgram Party were closed, while some were destroyed by protesters.   The cities included Mandalay, Sagaing, Monywa, Minbu and Magwein northern Burma, Taunggyi in Shan State, Moulmein in Mon Stateand Bassein in the Irrawaddy Delta. The reports gave no details.</TEXT></DOC>
