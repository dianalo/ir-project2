In a nationwide study, only half of 200 ad agency executives surveyed said they found any of the commercials informative. What's more, only beer and soft drink ads received high marks for entertainment value. About three-quarters of the respondents mentioned either beer or soft drinks as the most entertaining spots.    The big losers were automobile commercials, which were cited as informative by only 10% of the agency officials and as most entertaining by just 4%.    Overnight-delivery services and computer companies were rated as the most informative advertisers.    Frank Walton, president of Research andamp; Forecasts Inc., the public opinion and market research firm that did the study, said a new Michael J. Fox spot for Diet Pepsi seemed to be the biggest hit.    &quot;Federal Express, which for years was praised for its creative, light-hearted advertisements, polarized the advertising audience with its new, business-oriented commercials,&quot; he said.    Beer and overnight-delivery system ads were the most remembered of all the Super Bowl's commercials. But there was a marked difference in recall by brands.    Federal Express was cited by 74% of the people who recalled seeing an overnight-delivery spot, while United Parcel Service was named by 30%.    Among those who said they had watched a beer commercial, Budweiser and Bud Light were mentioned by 53%. Stroh rated a 34% recall score.    The biggest split occurred in the soft-drink category. About 80% of the agency executives who remembered a soft-drink commercial named a Pepsi brand, while just 29% cited a Coca-Cola brand.    Mr. Walton considered the results generally negative news for companies that spent about $650,000 for a single 30-second commercial during the big football game.    About 110 million people watched at least part of the Super Bowl, according to Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which broadcast the game. Viewing declined in the second half of the game as the eventual winners, the Washington Redskins, widened their lead over the Denver Broncos. </TEXT></DOC>
