Coal accounts for a large share of the greenhouse warmingbecause it forms carbon dioxide when burned _ all fossil fuelscontaining carbon do, coal more than others.   Carbon dioxide, in turn, accounts for half of the manmade gasesthat scientists say have warmed the Earth by one degree Fahrenheitover the past century, will make 1988 the warmest year on recordand could add as much as another eight degrees by late in the nextcentury. Such a development would make droughts and heat waves muchmore frequent in the American Midwest and South.   During a June 23 Senate Energy Committee hearing, a panel ofscientists reported that the warming has started. The reportespecially disturbed coal-state lawmakers such as Sen. WendellFord, D-Ky., who said, ``I'm trying to find a way to use a resourcewe have.''   Coal accounts for 80 percent of the fossil fuel used to generateelectricity in the United States. That generation accounts for 30percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions, and the UnitedStates in turn contributes about 30 percent of world carbon dioxide.   No ``clean burning'' technology can avoid the formation ofcarbon dioxide from fossil fuels: burning is simply the reaction ofcarbon with oxygen that transforms both to carbon dioxide.   But carbon dioxide can be ``scrubbed'' from smokestacks, whereit forms about 9 percent to 13 percent of gases from a fossil-fuelpower plant.   The higher the concentration, the easier the scrubbing _ a factthat Washington consultant Leon Green Jr. made use of in proposing,in general terms, using heat from nuclear fuel to gassify coal andcollect carbon dioxide.   The easily recovered CO2 could be used in greenhouses, toenhance crop growth and to make fertilizers, according to aproposal Green sketched at the February meeting of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science. However, Green couldnot yet say whether his carbon dioxide recovery system would befeasible.   One system that has been analyzed more extensively was developedby chemical engineers Hsing C. Cheng and Meyer Steinberg of theEnergy Department's Brookhaven, N.Y., National Laboratory. Theydesigned a system using a solvent to dissolve 90 percent of thecarbon dioxide out of a plant's exhaust gases.   Their plan calls for use of the plant's waste heat energy toremove carbon dioxide from the solvent and liquify it.   Cheng and Steinberg envisioned a network of pipelines to carryliquid carbon dioxide from power plants to the ocean or toabandoned oil and gas wells and salt caverns. In the ocean, theliquid would either rest on the ocean floor or be dissolved in thewater, depending on the system selected. In some areas, the oilindustry might buy the carbon dioxide to inject into oil fields tokeep up well pressures.   Power required to run the system would amount to 11 percent to16 percent of the generating capacity of the nation. But the systemcould reduce the annual amount of carbon dioxide added to theatmosphere worldwide by 10 percent if the United States used it and30 percent if all nations did.   ``However, the cost ... is significant when evaluated in lightof its benefit,'' Cheng and Steinberg said in a 1986 paper.``Overall, the CO2 control system could essentially increase thecapital investment of power plants by 70 percent to 150 percent,and increase the production cost of electricity by 56 percent to100 percent, depending on the location of the plant.''   Using 1980 data, Cheng and Steinberg calculated that the controlsystem could cost $284 billion dollars _ which could be $330billion at 1987 prices.   ``The percentages would not change very much,'' Cheng said in atelephone interview.   ``This seems not feasible in the light of energy efficienciesthat are possible,'' Cheng said. ``I still think the best way toreduce the greenhouse effect is through energy efficiencies, thoughit's very difficult to single out which (economic) sector should betackled first.''   Although energy efficiency has been improving by 2.5 percent peryear for more than a decade, the United States still takes twice asmuch energy to produce a dollar's worth of economic activity asGermany and Japan do.</TEXT></DOC>
