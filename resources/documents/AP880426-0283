Before trading started, the government reported that the theeconomy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three monthsof 1988.   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-Decemberquarter, but fell well within most forecasts.   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,said that even though the latest growth figure had beenanticipated, the market took some encouragement from it anyway.   ``It wasn't too low to dim hopes that the economic recoverywould continue,'' he said.   He also noted that the dollar and bond prices seem to havestabilized in recent days, and said that has helped the psychologyof some stock investors.   The market has also benefitted in recent days from some strongcorporate earnings reports.   In its latest economic report, the government also saidinflation slowed, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at anannual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in thefourth quarter.   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp.,said that was a slower inflation rate than some analysts hadexpected.   But he said the stock market is less concerned about the recentpast than with the future and is already looking toward a report onthe Index of Leading Indicators scheduled for release later thisweek.
