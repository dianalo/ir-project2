 The IRS specified the Posixstandard in its TMAC request for proposals.andP;  Asked whether the Posix Toolkitmight be appropriate for the TMAC procurement, Szymanski said, &quot;I thinkthere's no question that it could be used.&quot;andM;Bruce Weiner, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Mindcraft, said hiscompany's new product &quot;is targeted to anybody developing applications thathave to run in a Posix environment, whether it's a government agency, enduser or other type of user.&quot;andM;The TMAC procurement, which could be worth $1.8 billion, is based on an open,Posix-based system because Treasury officials believe such an approach willmaximize return on its investment in the face of shrinking budgets, Szymanskisaid.andP;  &quot;The FIPS is something we'd been looking for a long period of time,&quot;he said.andM;&quot;The FIPS as we know it today is something that is evolving, but nonethelessis a baseline for us to begin to draft specifications that continue to takeadvantage of what we've done in the past,&quot; Szymanski said.andP;  Szymanski, amember of the UniForum Technical Review Team, also said he hopes vendors willwork to understand better the FIPS process and the government environment.andM;Weiner and the Mindcraft team are no strangers to the government's FIPSprocess or to the conformance testing arena.andP;  Weiner has been and remains anoff-site research associate for the National Institute of Standards andTechnology, and he helped NIST develop its Posix conformance test suite.andM;Under contract to IBM Corp., Weiner and Mindcraft also developed IBM's Posixconformance test suites.andP;  That work led to the Posix Toolkit product, Weinersaid.andM;The Toolkit runs on IBM's RT workstation under AIX and on Apple Computer'sMacintosh under A/UX.andP;  It also runs under Xenix and Digital Equipment Corp.'sUltrix.andM;The package gives programmers tools to develop portable C-language programsand shell scripts for Posix systems, Weiner said.andP;  In addition, the tool kitenables programmers to develop Posix-conforming applications before they havea Posix-conforming system, he said.andM;The product consists of four components.andP;  The first, a Posix lint, checksapplication portability.andP;  &quot;The lint process is an important piece.andP;  It tellsyou whether or not you've used anything that's not defined in the [Instituteof Electrical and Electronics Engineers] IEEE 1003.1 and 1003.2 Posixstandards in terms of C interfaces,&quot; Weiner said.andM;The lint component also includes libraries and a shell script to control thelint process.andP;  &quot;These let you find out if your C programs use any systemcalls or library routines not defined in the 1003.1 or 1003.2 Posixstandards,&quot; Weiner said, adding that the product works with both the PosixFIPS and IEEE Posix implementations.andM;The second component, the Posix Simulator, enables programmers to developPosix-conforming applications on non-conforming systems.andP;  &quot;The simulator actsas a layer between your application and the operating system.andP;  It simulatesthe Posix interfaces on top of whatever native [UNIX] system you're running,&quot;Weiner said.andM;The simulator consists of a library of functions and headers that simulatePosix interfaces that are either missing or implemented in non-conformingways.andM;The third component, an exception handler and synchronizer, provides Cprogrammers with macros and functions that help to handle exceptions or errorconditions and to synchronize related processes.andM;&quot;One of the major problems people have in developing applications is how tohandle error conditions and exceptions.andP;  Everyone invents their own way ofdoing it, and it becomes very complex and messy.andP;  What we've done is provideda structured tool to do it,&quot; Weiner said.andM;Finally, the tool kit's Posix utilities component provides utilities definedby the IEEE 1003.2 Posix shell and tools standard, as well as utilities tosynchronize shell script execution, Weiner said.andM;Prices for the Posix Toolkit range from $250 to $300 per copy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
