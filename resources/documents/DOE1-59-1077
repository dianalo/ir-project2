Thispaper reviews the literature and attempts to compare and reconcile thesedifferent results. Section 2.0 examines the first two effects combined,i.e. the ratio of total consumption to total output. Section 3.0 focuseson the important determinants of the real intensities: what electricityis used for, how efficiently it is used, and other factors. Section 4.0examines the nature of the link between real electricity intensitiesand industrial productivity. Section 5.0 discusses different explanationsfor the changes in output mix.</TEXT></DOC>
