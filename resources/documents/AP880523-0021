Customs Service and Coast Guard patrols use some of the nation'smost sophisticated radars, patrol boats and aircraft. Customs hashelicopters with ``bust'' teams that swoop down on drug planes assoon as they touch down.   The Customs air wing now has 87 aircraft, 37 of them with thesophisticated equipment or speed to spot a suspicious aircraft,track it on radar, pursue it, and move in for the kill with ArmyBlackhawk helicopters.   A P3 turboprop surveillance plane to be delivered to Customsnext month will have high-tech radar with a full 360-degree range.Customs has four other P3s with sophisticated radar systems.   Customs also operates four tethered radar balloons, calledaerostats, and has four on order for the nation's Southwest borderfrom Texas to California _ currently the most porous area in aircoverage against drug smugglers.   The Coast Guard uses much of its 245-cutter fleet for drugmissions, and also has new, fast patrol boats _ 16 in service and21 on order. The agency also utilizes three fast boats that skimthe water, similar to hovercraft; two E2C surveillance planes,which are the Navy version of the Air Force's AWACS; and 22long-range C130 turboprop surveillance aircraft. Nine twin-engineFalcon jets are being refitted with interceptor radar.   The Coast Guard also operates an aerostat with another four onthe way, and flies helicopters for Bahamian law enforcement teamsfighting drug smugglers.   To ensure sophisticated communications, coordinated radarcoverage and up-to-the minute intelligence, the federal governmentis building three command, control, communications and intelligencecenters in the Miami area, Oklahoma City, and at March Air ForceBase in Riverside, Calif.   Despite this formidable buildup, agency officials and lawmakersagree that it hasn't stopped drugs from pouring into the UnitedStates.   Congress is trying to even the playing field with legislationthat would require more help from a military that has been wary ofdraining its resources and reluctant to take on a civilian lawenforcement role.   Both houses have passed legislation by wide margins to force thePentagon to do more, notwithstanding the 16,288 hours the militarysays it flew in support of drug law enforcement in 1987.   Final language will be worked out in a House-Senate conferenceon the Defense Department budget authorization bill.   The civilian buildup, while significant, has been anything butsteady.   The Coast Guard operating and acquisition budget for the drugwar grew just from $509 million in fiscal 1984 to a high of $557million in fiscal 1987.   But the figure for fiscal 1988 is down to $514 million, and hasforced a 55 percent cutback in hours devoted to drug patrols.   ``The drug people have to know our vessels are at the dock andplanes are not flying,'' said Vice Adm. James Irwin of the CoastGuard. ``Seizures are down.''   His agency is waiting for Congress to pass a $60 millionsupplemental appropriation so that full patrols can resume.   The Customs air wing has had better luck, with a budget thatgrew from $64.8 million in fiscal 1984 to $163 million in fiscal1988.   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Rep. Glenn English,D-Okla., said they often fought bitterly with the military to equipthe air wing.   ``We went through holy hell,'' said DeConcini, who heads theAppropriations subcommittee that oversees the Customs Servicebudget.   English is chairman of a House Government Operationssubcommittee that has continuously reviewed progress on the drugwar. Once, his staff prepared a chart showing that the number ofmilitary drug enforcement missions rose every time he held ahearing on military cooperation _ and then dropped off until thenext hearing.   He once found that Navy E2C's that were listed as flyinganti-drug missions on certain dates never left their base.   And DeConcini said that the Pentagon only gave Customs ahalf-dozen Beechcraft twin-engine turboprops after Congress agreedto buy a like number of new models for the military _ which usedthe planes in part to ferry top-ranking officers.</TEXT></DOC>
