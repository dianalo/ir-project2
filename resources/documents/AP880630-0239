(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists injected 2,200 corn stalkswith a microbe effective against the destructive European cornborer Thursday in the first approved outdoor test of a geneticallyengineered ``plant vaccine.''   Environmental groups did not oppose the tests, which wereapproved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and theDepartment of Agriculture.   The tests of the Cxc-Bt at the federal experimental station hereare the first approved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,''said Peter Carlson, chief scientist of Crop Genetics International,which developed the biological pesticide.   Cxc-Bt was also injected into an acre of corn owned by CropGenetics on Maryland's Eastern Shore, a company spokesman said.   Only one other genetically engineered crop protector, Frostban,a frost-inhibiting microbe, has been approved for field testing bythe EPA.   ``I think the result could be reduced use of chemicals for cropprotection,'' Carlson said. He said that would be ``good forfarming, good for the environment and good for the food supply.''   The corn borer, a moth larva introduced to the United States in1908, is one of agriculture's most destructive pests, attackingabout 200 plant species, Crop Genetics said. It costs Americanfarmers $400 million a year, according to the U.S. AgricultureDepartment.   The Audubon Society and Environmental Defense Fund took await-and-see attitude.   The important question is whether testing and regulation will beadequate because Cxc-Bt is just the beginning of a rush of perhapshundreds of similiar products, said Maureen Hinkle, the society'sdirector of agriculture policy.   Carlson said the main purpose of the test is to determinewhether the pesticide will spread from plant to plant, anundesireable effect.   The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of cornborers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans, according toresearchers.   In previous laboratory experiments, the microbe killed theborers in petrie dishes and sickened them when tested in agreenhouse, the company said.   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation onEconomic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work ingreenhouse tests and has lowered corn yields during some tests.</TEXT></DOC>
