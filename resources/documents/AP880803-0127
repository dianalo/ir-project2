Herrington told a news conference that a ``state-of-the-art''heavy-water reactor will be built at DOE's Savannah River complexnear Aiken, S.C., capable of producing all the tritium needed tomeet demand.   A second, smaller reactor that could be expanded if tests aresuccessful would be built at the Idaho National E~ ~ScbO /o_\o.   The two reactors will cost an e P$6.8 billion and willtake approximedely 10 years to complete.   ``With this approach, we have increased assurance that we canhave the reactor capacity we need on schedule and that no singleexternal event or generic technical issue can cause a totalshutdown of our tritium production capacity,'' Herrington said.   Earlier today, Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, had said he wasconfident that the planned gas-cooled test reactor at Idaho Fallseventually would be expanded into a full-scale production reactor.But Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and some other senators said themoney to finance such an expansion might not be available.   ``The Savannah River reactor will be the No. 1 priority,'' saidSen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who had helped South Carolina lawmakers lobbyfor the project.   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said theIdaho reactor would be a ``back-up system'' and that Congress willhave to ``look very closely'' before deciding whether to expandthat reactor.   Thurmond said Savannah River was the ``most logical'' choice fora new production reactor because of ``its existing infrastructure,its wealth of trained and dedicated personnel, and the unwaveringsupport it enjoys on the federal, state and local levels.''   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Savannah was ``simply thebest site'' because it has ``the needed support facilities, theproven technology and experienced, first-rate personnel.''   That reactor will cost an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion tobuild.   An Energy Department advisory board concluded last month thatconstruction of a new, heavy-water reactor at Savannah Riverprovided the p`best chance'' of ensuring an adequate anduninterrup|ed of triium, a key ingredient in nuclearweapons.   The department has four aging production reactors, three atSavannah River and one at the Hanford reservation in Washingtonstate.   The three Savannah River reactors are shut down for variousreasons, but had previously been operating at less than 50 percentof full power because of safety concerns.   The reactor at the Hanford reservation in Washington state wasplaced on ``cold standby'' earlier this year.   Joseph Salgado, an acting deputy secretary of energy, told aSenate appropriations subcommittee last week that construction of anew reactor was essential for national security reasons.   ``Future requirements cannot be met reliably with existingfacilities,'' Salgado said.   About 5 percent of the nation's stockpile of tritium is losteach year through natural radioactive decay, Salgado said.   ``Without a continued supply of new tritium, the effectivenessof our overall nuclear deterrent capability deteriorates rapidly,''said Salgado.</TEXT></DOC>
