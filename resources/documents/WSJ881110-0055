Many traders had expected the dollar to get a short-term boost from a Bush victory and then to begin to recede. But few anticipated that the rally would be so short or that the initial decline would be so steep.    &quot;The 'Bush dollar' lasted a very, very short time -- about an hour,&quot; said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank.    Traders said the dollar's fall reflected continued worry about the U.S. trade and budget deficits. &quot;There was nothing really coming out of this campaign to address these problems,&quot; Mr. Kessler said.    &quot;When the U.S. (market) came in and saw the dollar well off its highs of the Far East, it sold {the dollar} down even further,&quot; he added.    In late New York trading the dollar stood at 1.7637 marks and 124.07 yen, down from 1.7890 marks and 125.73 yen late Tuesday. The British pound climbed to $1.7922 from $1.7700 a day earlier.    At mid-morning Thursday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency was trading at about 123.90 yen, down from 123.95 at the opening of trading; it had closed Wednesday in Tokyo at 124.65 yen.    Besides the trade and budget-deficit issues, traders attributed the dollar's fall Wednesday to news that the Democratic Party had increased its hold on the House of Representatives and Senate. In addition, Japanese exporters and others sold heavily when the dollar traded near its highs.    Strong Democratic control of Congress, traders contended, threatens to increase U.S. protectionist sentiment and make it more difficult for the legislature and administration to come to agreement on major economic issues -- particularly after a vitriolic presidential campaign.    Traders and analysts have been decidedly bearish about the dollar's prospects for weeks. The U.S. currency has fallen more than 6% against its West German counterpart and nearly 8% against Japan's currency since Sept. 29 when the dollar traded at 1.8825 marks and 134.38 yen.    &quot;The heart of America is the freedom to spend, low taxation, low gasoline prices and low interest rates,&quot; said Geoff Earnshaw, a senior foreign-exchange manager at National Westminster Bank PLC in London. &quot;Not much more than lip service has been paid to solving the twin {U.S. budget and trade} deficit problem, and the market doesn't expect much more from Bush than the past six years.&quot;    Dealers described trading Tuesday night and yesterday as active, uncertain and volatile. Trading desks at many big European banks remained open all night Tuesday to track election results.    In early activity yesterday in the Far East, the dollar climbed to a high of 1.8040 marks and 126.05 yen on news that Mr. Bush had won the election. But within an hour, the U.S. currency began to tumble.    &quot;As soon as it was certain that Bush was going to make it, we had a little rise, and then the market took advantage of it to sell into the rise,&quot; said Robert Bauer, a senior currency dealer at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.    Traders said that many Japanese corporations -- particularly exporters and trading companies -- had left stop-loss orders with banks to sell dollars at the 125.80-to-126 yen level.    The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the Far East, selling yen for dollars when the currency was trading at 124.50 yen. But traders said the amounts were believed to be small and the intervention's impact negligible. Traders also said that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also sold small amounts of yen in the New York market. The Fed declined to confirm or deny that it had intervened.    In European activity, the dollar was pounded again when traders said that Czechoslovakia unloaded $500 million.    Fifteen hours after it peaked, the dollar had fallen nearly 3% to its intraday low of 1.7565 marks. And in early afternoon New York activity, it hit an intraday low of 123.75 yen, down nearly 2% from its high. The last time the dollar traded that low against the yen was in early January. Its record intraday lows were 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks, also set in early January.    &quot;That's a significant move in less than 24 hours,&quot; said Mr. Kessler of Chase Manhattan. &quot;Yet we have seen no intervention against the Deutschemark and little against the yen.&quot;    Mr. Kessler pointed out that in the past several weeks, the only major central banks to intervene in support of the dollar have been those of the U.S. and Japan. &quot;It appears that the (West German) Bundesbank isn't concerned about a stronger Deutschemark,&quot; he said.    Some dealers suspect that the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- have decided to lower the dollar's trading range they agreed upon in February 1987. While never disclosed, most traders and economists have believed the central banks' so-called band of tolerance is 1.60-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen.    Still fear of central bank dealing has traders on edge. &quot;There are no official intervention levels, but it's Bretton Woods revisited because you know {the central banks} are going to be there,&quot; said Mr. Bauer of Commerzbank. &quot;You don't know when, but you know they're going to be there.&quot; At Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944, the major industrial nations agreed on the fixed-exchange rate system that lasted until 1971.    Nonetheless, &quot;this market is going to continue to sell dollars until the central banks come in and say: 'That's it,'&quot; said Mr. Kessler. Many dealers point to the prominent role that James A. Baker -- and possibly Martin Feldstein -- will play in the new Bush administration. Named yesterday to be the new secretary of state, Mr. Baker as Treasury secretary under President Reagan is regarded as the architect of the weak dollar policy begun in 1985.    In addition, Mr. Feldstein, a Harvard University economics professor and former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, often has argued that the high U.S. trade deficit calls for a lower dollar.    Mr. Earnshaw of National Westminster sees the currency at 1.65-1.70 marks and 115 yen by next June. If the twin deficit problem isn't dealt with, &quot;over the longer period, the dollar's definitely heading south; it's just a matter of how far, over what time,&quot; he said.    In an analysis sent to clients yesterday morning, British brokers James Capel andamp; Co. said: &quot;Bush comes to office with both a commitment not to raise taxes and with increased Democratic majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives. As Congress controls the purse strings on the spending side, it is difficult to see where a resolution of the budget impasse is going to come from.&quot;    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery jumped $4 to $423.10 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $424.05 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
