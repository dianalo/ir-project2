Right-wing critics of the government said it was not doing enoughto end the revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip.   The army closed Palestinian schools in four West Bank cities forthree days and three others for 10 days. The closures were aimed atstopping the violence that has taken the lives of at least 13teen-agers in the past week, the army said.   In violence today, two Palestinian teen-agers were wounded in aclash with troops in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, Arab newsreports said.   An Israeli driver and a Palestinian passenger suffered minorinjuries when a firebomb was thrown at a bus near the West Bank cityof Ramallah, Israel radio reported.   Rabin came under fire in the legislature for his latest policy ofallowing troops to shoot plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwerseven as they flee, and for expanding the number of troops allowed toshoot.   Plastic and rubber bullets were introduced as a less lethalmethod of quelling riots than live ammunition, but they have beenblamed for several deaths, including eight of the teen-agers killedin the past week.   Three deaths Tuesday brought the number of Palestinians killed inthe 13-month uprising to 362. Fifteen Israelis have died.   Another part of the new policy calls for punishing stone-throwersby wrecking or sealing their homes or confiscating their families'property.   ``As long as the residents of the (occupied) territories aren'tready to sit down at the negotiating table, as long as they respondwith violence, rocks and bottles, they will not make us run away,they will not make us surrender. They will suffer,'' Rabin said.   Hecklers interrupted him at least a dozen times before he stoppedspeaking and angrily took his seat. Some critics called for hisresignation.   One detractor, Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens' RightsMovement, said: ``This policy is not only killing Palestinians butalso the souls of Israeli soldiers. I say to you that for the sakeof our future and our common destiny, ours and the Palestinians ...I say to you Mr. Defense Minister, go.''   The debate followed the introduction of no-confidence motions byeight factions against the government's handling of the latestviolence.   Rehavam Zeevi of the ultra-nationalist Homeland Party, whichseeks the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied lands,represented one of three parties that criticized Rabin for not goingfar enough.   ``Children and teen-agers are running wild in the villages and onthe roads ... For them it's a festival. For us, a continuous YomKippur,'' the Jewish Day of Atonement, Zeevi said. ``There is nojustification for this.''   The Cabinet, which includes the right-wing Likud bloc and theleft-leaning Labor Party, was expected to easily defeat theno-confidence motions from the small parties.   Also today, police fired rubber bullets to quell one disturbanceat a high school in Arab east Jerusalem and detained eightdemonstrators, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.   An army statement said most of the school closures were meant toprevent further violence and thwart student plans to stage strikes``for reasons that have nothing to do with education, such as housedemolitions.''   In line with the new army policy, soldiers Tuesday dynamitedthree homes of Palestinians in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya.   Palestinian merchants closed their shops and publictransportation came to a halt in Jenin, Ramallah, Qalqilya and Arabeast Jerusalem in protest of the latest demolitions and the rash ofdeaths, Arab reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
