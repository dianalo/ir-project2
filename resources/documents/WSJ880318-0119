Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK ECO </IN><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bailout of troubled Texas banks and thrifts could expand the federal budget deficit by billions of dollars and force new deficit-cutting efforts before this fall's election, some administration officials said.    Federal efforts to support financial institutions in Texas weren't fully accounted for in the administration's proposed budget for fiscal 1989, officials said. As a result, the bailouts -- particularly of thrifts -- could push the revised fiscal 1989 deficit estimate due this summer past the $146 billion allowed under the Gramm-Rudman law. Congress then would either have to enact new budget cuts, or allow harsh across-the-board spending cuts to kick in just a few weeks before the November election.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has made a potentially costly commitment to prevent the closure of First Republic Bank Corp. of Dallas, and may have to help other Texas banks as well. FDIC spokesman Steven Katsanos said the agency anticipated large bank-rescue costs in its budgeting. Despite the growing troubles of First RepublicBank and other Texas banks, he said, &quot;I don't see anything that would cause us to significantly change our estimate.&quot;    First RepublicBank isn't related to San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp.    But Bank Board officials concede their plan to subsidize mergers of troubled Texas thrifts wasn't reflected in the 1989 Reagan administration budget. Dennis Pittman, chief financial officer of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., said the plan will increase fiscal 1989 outlays by at least $2 billion. Bank Board spokesman Bill Fulwider called that a &quot;best-case scenario,&quot; and said the total could be substantially higher.    The FSLIC expects to pay out about $7 billion, mostly in notes, to prop up Texas thrift institutions in the next year. FSLIC officials said they expect a substantial portion to be delayed until fiscal 1989.    Whether 1989 outlays increase will depend partly on whether the White House budget office sticks by its new determination to count promissory notes as outlays in the year they are issued. In past years, only interest and principal payments on such notes have been treated as outlays.    Administration and congressional budget officials have been hoping to avoid politically painful budget cuts during the election year. In its proposed budget, the administration projected the deficit, calculated under Gramm-Rudman rules, would total $142.7 billion next year without further cuts. The Gramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $136 billion for fiscal 1989, but allows the deficit to be as much as $10 billion more before automatic spending cuts are required.    If the administration's new estimate of the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit this summer exceeds $146 billion, Congress will have to enact measures to get it under $146 billion, or face across-the-board cuts slashing the deficit to the $136 billion target. The automatic cuts would become final Oct. 15.    The Congressional Budget Office has criticized the administration's budget estimates, arguing that the fiscal 1989 deficit under Gramm-Rudman rules is likely to be closer to $177 billion. That larger estimate is based partly on more pessimistic estimates of the economy's performance. Under the revised version of the budget law, however, the administration's estimates are the only ones that matter in calculating automatic cuts.    The administration also can head off budget cuts by adopting even more optimistic assumptions about the economy this summer. Referring to the White House penchant for sanguine forecasts, one Democratic congressional aide said: &quot;Rosy will be as rosy as rosy needs to be.&quot;    But the administration's budget assumptions are already more upbeat than most private forecasters, and making them even more so will be difficult. The White House is predicting economic growth of 2.4% this year and 3.5% next year. And it assumes that interest rates on three-month Treasury bills will average a low 5.3% this year and 5.2% next year. </TEXT></DOC>
