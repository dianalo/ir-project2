(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lionel Trains Inc. will keep 1988sales rolling with a tiny video camera that almost lets modelrailroaders feel like part of their prized layouts, a spokesmansaid Tuesday.   And in an effort to establish itself in other areas, Lionel ismaking plastic parts for a new board game for would-be railtycoons, Marketing Director John Brady said.   Lionel hopes the high-tech, miniaturized ``Railscope'' videocamera, expected to be in stores in time for Christmas, will be theticket to higher sales.   The camera is small enough to mount in a locomotive for anengineer's eye view of a model railroader's prized layout.   ``It's just like getting small and becoming part of thatlayout,'' Brady said. ``It's a simple idea that was not doableuntil this year.''   Lionel developed the tiny black-and-white electronic camera withthe help of James Wickstead Design in New Jersey. The picture canbe displayed on a standard television or even larger screen,although Lionel will sell a 4{-inch monitor, Brady said.   Railscope was introduced at the annual Toy Fair trade show inFebruary in New York, he said, adding, ``I had people asking to buythe prototype.''   It will sell for about $300 in a model-train collectors marketin which Lionel's prices, for example, range from less than $75 fora train set to more than $1,000 for a locomoti   Attached to each bomb were about 300 sticks of dynamite,according to a communique issued by the civil aviation office. Thebombs and the dynamite were buried at the western end of therunway, and were connected to a 2,000-foot-long detonating cablethat ran to a secluded ravine nearby, it said.   The explosives were discovered on Saturday, the communique said.   According to La Nacion, a government-owned and -operated dailypublished in Santiago, the bombs represented ``a new extremist plotagainst the head of state's life.''   It cited unidentified security sources as saying the bombs wereplanted in late January, after it was announced that Pinochet wouldattend an agricultural fair in La Serena on Jan. 29. The presidentlater canceled the visit.   In September 1986, Pinochet survived an ambush of his motorcadeby the pro-communist Manuel Rodriguez Front, the country'sprincipal leftist guerrilla organization. Five of his bodyguardswere killed in the attack by machine-gun and rocket fire.   Pinochet on Tuesday credited providence with foiling thereported plot in La Serena.   ``God doesn't want to carry me off, so he helps me,'' Pinochettold reporters in the southern city of Puerto Montt, where he wasinspecting public works projects. His remarks were broadcast bySantiago radio stations.   ``It give me more enthusiasm to fight for my country, as I amdoing,'' he said. ``I'm a lot luckier than they (extremists)think.''   He said it was only ``by chance'' that he did not travel to LaSerena as planned. ``There were a series of problems that obligedme to stay in Santiago,'' he said without elaboration.</TEXT></DOC>
