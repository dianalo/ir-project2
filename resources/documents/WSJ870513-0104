That's a big claim for a two-year-old company with six employees. But if Reliable Water Inc.'s high-technology credentials are any indication, the closely held company may both improve desalinization technology and become a pioneer in the control of factory machines with expert systems -- computers that simulate thinking of human experts.    Founded by Ed Fredkin, formerly director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computer science laboratory, the company has attracted investors that include Jerome Wiesner, MIT's president emeritus, and Gordon Bell, assistant director of the National Science Foundation. Computer software at the heart of its technology was developed by Gensym Corp., an artificial-intelligence software concern in Cambridge, Mass., that recently was formed by former employees of LISP Machine Inc., a maker of computers for artificial-intelligence uses.    Reliable's technology is based on reverse osmosis -- a widely used process in which saltwater is forced against polymer membranes under high pressure. Some of the water goes through without its salt; the remaining highly salty water is returned to its source. To make the process more efficient, Mr. Fredkin invented fancy hydraulics to recycle much of the energy used to pressurize incoming water.    More importantly, Reliable's desalinization system is controlled by a personal computer that oversees its operations much as a human operator might, said Mr. Fredkin. The computer's program is designed to incorporate thousands of rules, such as &quot;if water pressure rises at valves X and Y, then shut down valve Z.&quot; By constantly monitoring the system, the computer increases desalinization efficiency and may be able to predict system failures, preventing costly breakdowns, Mr. Fredkin added.    At a news conference yesterday, Reliable demonstrated a prototype of its desalinization technology by serving water from Boston harbor -- one of the nation's dirtiest -- that the device had processed. &quot;Our main innovation is to make an expert system run in real time,&quot; continually monitoring and adjusting an industrial process, said Mr. Fredkin, sipping a sample from the clicking and sighing machine. &quot;The idea is to run it in a remote place without skilled operators. If something goes wrong, the system will call us on the phone.&quot;    Reliable's system initially will cost more than conventional reverse-osmosis systems, Mr. Fredkin said. But those costs will be returned within a few years by operating savings. Reliable estimates it can process sea water for about half a cent a gallon, compared with two to three times that for conventional desalinization.    Reliable plans to develop small systems for commercial use -- large enough to supply water to a hotel or small community -- by early 1988. The company will build and operate the systems and sell the water they produce, Mr. Fredkin said. He added that Reliable's expert system will be continually updated with rules suggested by experience at each of its desalinization plants. &quot;As the years go by, the system will get smarter and smarter,&quot; he said.    Desalinization experts agreed that Reliable's technology sounds interesting, but they said it is too early to judge its worth. &quot;The best opportunity for its use might be with smaller applications,&quot; in which minimizing costs for human operators is a high priority, said James Birkett, a desalinization expert with Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consulting company. </TEXT></DOC>
