The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw outthe lawsuit because of delays by the Cleveland Newspaper Guild andothers in pursuing the case.   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to heararguments in the case. But the votes of at least four justices arerequired to grant such review.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 10-5 ruling lastFebruary, said it would be unfair to permit the newspaper to besued after such a long delay.   The appeals court also rejected arguments by the union and thewomen who accused the Plain Dealer of bias that the newspaper had``unclean hands'' because it contributed to the delays.   The appeals court said that while throwing out such a civilrights suit is an extreme measure it is necessary ``when theprejudice to the defendant can be avoided in no other way.''   The case began in April 1972 when the newspaper guild, on behalfof its female members, filed a charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission.   The complaint accused the newspaper of sex discrimination in itshandling of merit pay, promotions and assignments and in otheremployment practices.   Four years passed before the EEOC began its investigation.Another six years elapsed before the union and its members sued thePlain Dealer in federal court.   In 1976, the Plain Dealer refused to surrender personnel recordssought by the federal agency. In 1980, the newspaper said thedocuments no longer were available.   The 6th Circuit court said the newspaper's lack of cooperationwith the commission's investigation does not explain the initialfour-year delay in launching the probe.   The appeals court noted that the trial judge who dismissed thesuit initially had found that ``the EEOC's notice to defendant toretain personnel records was too ambiguous to serve as a validcommand.''   The case is Cleveland Newspaper Guild vs. Plain Dealer, 87-1864.</TEXT></DOC>
