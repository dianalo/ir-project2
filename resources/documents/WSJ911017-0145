For years, most big employers have taken band-aidapproaches to their employees' child-care difficulties,administering federal tax breaks for child-care costs throughtheir payroll departments or offering referrals to existingservices.</LP><TEXT>   But now, many companies are worried that a shortage ofhigh-quality child care is hurting productivity. Daunted bythe potential cost of broad efforts to raise the supply andquality of child care, many of them are joining forces tostretch their child-care dollars.   The trend is creating some strange bedfellows.International Business Machines Corp. is teaming up withAmerican Express Co. and the Allstate Insurance unit ofSears, Roebuck andamp; Co. on one big project, while Eastman KodakCo. has joined forces with Xerox Corp. and Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc.on another.   But some creative potential solutions are emerging. Somepartnerships are forcing community child-care standardshigher by subsidizing high-quality facilities that serve thepublic. Others are offering new benefits to child-careworkers. Still others are financing efforts by child-carecenters to win accreditation.   The partnerships &quot;are using a community strategy, and itgoes beyond any individual corporation building its ownchild-care center,&quot; says Fran Rodgers, president ofWork/Family Directions, a Boston consulting concern that isorganizing and managing many of the new partnerships. &quot;Thesecompanies are building an infrastructure for child care inthis country that doesn't exist.&quot;   The new efforts aren't charity, Ms. Rodgers adds. Whilethe partnerships draw on the experience of some pioneeringphilanthropic ventures, they are financed with corporatedollars. They also require that their own employees benefit.   The change in strategy reflects a growing dissatisfactionwith the narrower child-care strategies of the past. Phonereferral services are popular and cheap but do little good inareas where few openings exist. Many employers, includingAmerican Express, have explored building their own child-carecenters and concluded that the cost and liability are toogreat to bear alone. IBM and others worry that corporatecenters shortchange employees who work in branch offices orprefer other kinds of child care.   Also, child-care problems in most regions of the countrytranscend the efforts of any one company acting alone.Child-care workers' average pay ranks in the bottom 10% ofall wage-earning categories, well below janitors, and manyreceive no health, unemployment or disability benefits.Morale and education levels among child-care workers are low,and turnover is more than 40% a year -- more than twice thenational average. The Child Care Action Campaign, an advocacygroup, says the resulting breakdowns in child care cost U.S.business $3 billion a year.   To seek new remedies, IBM quietly convened a meeting inGreenwich, Conn., a few months ago involving 39 of thenation's largest employers, including Exxon Corp., Amoco Co.,Tenneco Inc. and Johnson andamp; Johnson. Travelers Corp. and theMervyn's and Target units of Dayton Hudson Corp. are alsotalking with possible partners. And Allstate is &quot;hotlypursuing&quot; partnerships in 20 locations and has published aguidebook to help its regional managers seek outcollaborators.   In many communities, the corporate dollars are making adifference. The biggest collaboration so far, a new $2million, 194-child day-care center in Charlotte, N.C., isfinanced by IBM and four partners but is open to the publicas well as sponsors' employees. The center slashes theteacher-child ratio to half that required by the state ofNorth Carolina. Employee pay and benefits are above average.&quot;That drives up costs. But as long as it supports an increasein the quality of care, we're willing to support it,&quot; saysTed Childs, director of affirmative action and work-forcediversity programs for IBM.   For Karen Reavis, a senior buyer for IBM in Charlotte, thefunding means her two children, ages 1 1/2 and three, havebetter care. At their last center, &quot;I never saw the teachersinteracting with the kids,&quot; she says. With two adults in herolder child's class of 24, the children &quot;were just runningaround and screaming. There was no sense of order.&quot;   At the new center, a sense of calm prevails. Classes arehalf the size. When her son sees his teacher each morning,&quot;he runs up to her, grabs her and hugs her,&quot; Ms. Reavis says.After just two months, her son already speaks more clearlyand seems more content and less aggressive, she adds. As aresult, &quot;I can concentrate on what I'm doing at work.&quot;   Other programs are creating new slots for children infamily day-care homes -- the small, home-based businessesthat provide a quarter of the paid child care in the U.S. Inthe Dallas-Fort Worth area, Child Care Co., with funding fromIBM and Travelers, has recruited 75 new home child-careproviders, each of whom could care for four to six children.   The program offers incentives to those who complete aprofessional training program. &quot;We try to motivate people tostay with it. We teach that child care is important work. Weoffer training in health and safety, and we try to foster asense of entrepreneurship,&quot; says Roberta Bergman, executivevice president.   Such programs have a direct effect on the quality of childcare. Rosemarie Peebles, a Sacramento, Calif., home day-careprovider who completed training financed by the Mervyn's unitof Dayton Hudson, learned how to take inventory of her toysand determine what new types she needs to foster broad skillsin the children she cares for. She also learned to keepcomputer records on naps, activities and diaper changes, apractice she says has improved her communication withparents.   Other companies have found that even a small increase inemployee benefits can have a big impact on turnover andcredentials among child-care workers. After a corporate taskforce including Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Bausch andamp; Lomb andothers helped arrange low-cost group health benefits forchild-care workers in the Rochester, N.Y., area, KarenLittle, the director of the Luv 'n' Care day-care centerthere, noticed a difference almost immediately.   One valued nine-year staffer stopped job-hunting forbetter benefits and decided to stay on. Now that Ms. Littleis able to add the word &quot;benefits&quot; to help-wantedadvertising, the pool of applicants has improved, too. &quot;I'mgetting phone calls from professionals, people with goodexperience,&quot; she says.   The change has led to a regional improvement in workingconditions, with new child-care centers in the area offeringcompetitive benefit packages to employees, says Barbara-AnnMattle, executive director of the Western New York Child CareCouncil, which manages the benefits program.   Other companies are upgrading existing centers where theiremployees have placed their children. IBM and BurroughsWellcome Co. are financing efforts by about 20 child-carecenters in the Research Triangle Park, N.C., area to winaccreditation from the National Association for the Educationof Young Children, the largest professional association ofearly-childhood educators. That means training staff,renovating buildings and buying equipment.   Other partnerships are exploring ways to improve thesupply of emergency child care. Groups of companies andprofessional firms in the New York City and Minneapolis areashave formed networks to provide subsidized care for sickchildren and backup care when other arrangements break down.Two groups in the San Francisco and Long Beach, Calif., areasare considering similar moves.   Whatever the outcome, more new child-care partnerships arelikely to be announced in coming months. Given the scope ofthe nation's child-care problems and the cost of prospectivesolutions, says Barbara Katersky, director of employeerelations for American Express, collaborations &quot;are the onlyway corporations are going to be able to afford to go.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
