The incidents range from swastikas painted on campus bulletinboards to violence against members of minority groups, the ADLsaid, and they are increasing.   The ADL's annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents on collegecampuses showed a sharp rise from six cases in 1984 to 38 lastyear. The group counted 12 in 1985, 19 in 1986 and only 14 in 1987.Figures for 1989 won't be available until January, a spokesman said.   The National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence saidincidents motivated by prejudice occurred on 174 college campusesfrom September 1986 to December 1988.   The ADL listed a few of the cases from the past two years.   _Last month, two Jewish students leaving a party at the HillelHouse at Brooklyn College were severely beaten by a group of youthsshouting anti-Jewish slurs.   _A group of youths marched on the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternityhouse at the University of Illinois campus in Champaign-Urbana lastmonth, shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Students inside called policefor help.   _Campus sidewalks at the University of Delaware were defacedwith slogans such as ``Stay in the closet, fag'' in October 1988.   _An American Indian student serving as the Macalester College'scommunity council president in St. Paul, Minn., received hate mailduring the fall of 1988, including a letter that read in part,``Custer should have finished off your entire degenerate race.''   _Lesbian students in a dorm lounge at Boston University wereaccosted by a man who threw one against a glass wall and threatenedto kill another student who tried to intervene.   _The first black fraternity house on the campus of theUniversity of Mississippi was burned down in August 1988 before themembers moved in. Arson was suspected.   _The Hillel Foundation building at Rutgers University wasdefaced with swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans such as ``Die Jew''in January 1988 and August of this year.   ADL Director Abraham H. Foxman said his group has been unable todetermine why bigotry has increased.   ``If we knew why, we could have done something to prevent it,''he said. ``The fact that it is happening is serious enough to focusas much attention on it.   ``One way of dealing with it is exposing it. We're dealing withprejudice _ it's a disease, an illness. We can't afford to sitback, we have to do everything we can to limit its virulence.''   Some of the university administrators at the conferencesuggested ``codes of conduct'' against bigotry, but Foxman wasuncertain of their effectiveness.   ``I would rather see a stigma attached to acts of bigotry on acollege campus than to have to `legislate' against them. But thatdepends on whether or not college officials speak out quickly,clearly and unequivocally,'' he said.   Temple University President Peter J. Liacouras, keynote speakerfor the conference, called on universities to go beyond condemningbias to eliminating it from their policies for hiring and studentadmissions.   ``Young people on campuses will look at our message to them andat our actions,'' said Liacouras.   About 200 college administrators and other delegates attendedthe conference, which was held in conjunction with the ADL'sfour-day executive committee meeting in Philadelphia.   The ADL sponsored similar conferences in May at Augsburg Collegein Minneapolis and in January 1988 at Wellsley College in Wellsley,Mass. It plans similar gatherings early next year at Ohio State andGeorge Washington universities.</TEXT></DOC>
