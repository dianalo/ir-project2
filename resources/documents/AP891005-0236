The International Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers, 57,000-strong at Boeing and a major force in the airlineindustry, remains fiercely loyal to traditional trade unionismduring an era of union compromises, wage concessions andemployee-management buyouts.   In addition to the Boeing walkout, Machinists union membersWednesday entered the eighth month of their strike against Easternand were holding out against joining pilots and management at UALCorp. in a proposed $6.75 billion buyout of that company, theparent of United Airlines.   ``They are probably the most militant of the unions,'' saidLouis Marckesano, an airline analyst at the Philadelphia brokerageJanney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``They are a tough union.''   They can afford to be. Members of the 850,000-worker union haveskills that often give them an edge in the job market and make themdifficult to replace.   At Seattle-based Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraftmanufacturer, the union represents the bulk of the company'sproduction workers. They perform tasks ranging from riveting,wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections andmachine-tool maintenance.   ``They have a much better labor market than everyone else,''said Peter Cappelli, an associate professor of management at theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.   For the last decade or so, the Machinists have been the unionmost strongly opposed to wage concessions and changes in thetraditional adversary relationship between labor and management,Cappelli said.   That's why they have refused so far to participate in theplanned buyout of UAL, which proposes worker wage concessions inreturn for a majority ownership stake. But the Machinists areexpected to ask UAL soon to negotiate a new labor contract, and theunion could use the issue of its participation as a bargaining chipin the talks.   Industry analysts believe the pilot-management takeover couldsucceed without the Machinists, who have had a rocky relationshipin recent years with the pilots at United.   In contrast, at Eastern the pilots walked out in sympathy withthe Machinists, temporarily shutting down the Miami-based carrierand driving it into bankruptcy court in early March. But thatstrike has left thousands of Machinists, pilots and flightattendants without jobs as Eastern hired and trained replacementworkers.   Eastern and Boeing are worlds apart. The aerospace giant isprosperous, with an order backlog of nearly 1,600 commercial jetsworth about $70 billion. The Machinists at Boeing are much youngeron the average than their counterparts at Eastern, and the unionleadership at Boeing didn't have a clear idea beforehand of whetherthey would vote to strike, according to a union operative who askednot to be identified.   Machinists leaders and spokesmen at their national headquartersin Washington were unavailable for comment Wednesday.   Despite the bitter setback at Eastern, the strike strengthenedthe resolve of Machinists around the nation and made them morewilling to fight for their demands, union activists say.   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's AirlineDivision, suggested that airlines waiting for their new jets alsomight apply pressure to Boeing by threatening to turn to othermanufacturers.   ``Boeing is a different type of situation and I think it's goingto be very effective,'' said Genoese, who is based in New York. ``Ithink (the Machinists) are in a pretty good situation to get whatthey want.''   Unlike the Teamsters, the Machinists union is marked by theautonomy of its local chapters. Charles Bryan, the leader of theMachinists at Eastern, exercised a strong leadership role and was athorn in the side of former Eastern Chairman Frank Borman andcurrent boss Frank Lorenzo.   Still, Machinists have long looked to their national leadershipfor inspiration and tactical direction.   William Winpisinger, the unapologetic, outspoken Machinistsleader, often labeled a socialist by critics, recently retiredafter 12 years as the union's president. His successor, formerunion vice president George Kourpias, is expected to maintain thetraditions.   While ``Winpy'' has been the ideological standard-bearer of theunion, its tactical chief in airline matters is John Peterpaul, avice president who once worked as an airline mechanic and has acommercial pilot's license.</TEXT></DOC>
