Acampo St., Acampo, CA, had submitted pesticidepetition 7F3558 to EPA. The petition proposed that an exemption from therequirement of a tolerance under 40 CFR Part 180 be established for residuesof the biorational nematicide sesame stalk in or on the following commodities:cotton, soybeans, potatoes, sugarbeets, tomatoes, bell peppers, squash,strawberries, eggplants, cucumbers, carrots, radishes, turnips, onions,peas, melons, grapes, walnut, almond, orange, grapefruit, mulberry, peach,apple, apricot, blackberry, loganberry, pecan, cherry, plum, and cranberry.Ground sesame stalk (there are no inert ingredients) is to be used as soilmulch for the control of various nematodes. This product is prepared bycutting the sesame plant stalks remaining after the harvest of the seedand then processing these stalks through a grinder to produce a coarselyground product ranging in size from dust to pices \1/2\&quot; wide by 2&quot; long.Ground sesame stalk is intended for use for preplanting of annual plantsor postplanting applications of annual, perennial, or established plantsor trees to control root knot, root lesion, citrus, stubby root, stylet,and dagger nematodes. The product is broadcast over the entire treatmentarea by a hand or power operated gravity or rotary-type spreader designedfor application of fibrous types of materials. Band application of theground sesame stalk is also permitted after spreading; the material isincorporated into the soil by dicing or other suitable means. The materialmay be applied to dry or wet soil; however, moisture is required to activatethe nematicide action. According to the petitioner, the primary constituentsof the sesame stalk are lignin, cellulose and fiber. The petitioner alsosubmitted information from the University of California, Irvine, concerningthe chemical analysis of sesame stalk, which contains the following threenaturally occurring compounds that are not known to be toxic to humansor livestock: sesamin, sesamolin, and quercetin 3-o-glycoside. These threecompounds contribute less than 1 percent to the overall composition.In support of his request, the petitioner noted that sesame has been grownas a food crop for years with no known toxicity problems. In areas wheresesame is raised, after the seed has been harvested the fields are frequentlyused as pasture land for all types of grazing animals. The U.S. Food andDrug Administration has granted a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) statusto sesame oil as both a human and animal food substance. These are referencedunder 21 CFR 182.10 and 21 CFR 582.10. In addition, the petitioner statedthat the sesame stalks have been commonly used as mulch around fruit andother trees for years.The petitioner requested a waiver from data requirements for determiningthe magnitude of the residues from crop field trials, for a descriptionof the residue analytical method used, and for the submittal of analyticalreference standards. The petitioner's rationale was that the product isincorporated into the soil and is not sprayed or dusted upon the plantor edible portions thereof. The petitioner also requested a waiver fromthe data requirements of practicable methods for removing residues thatexceed any proposed tolerance since there is no resulting residue of significanceand any residue that may be present would be of no known toxicologicalconcern.The Agency waives the data requirement for the residue analytical method,submittal of analytical reference standards, and determining the magnitudeof the residue crop field trials. Data on chemical identity, directionfor use, and nature of the residues in plants have been submitted. Acceptabledaily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerationsare not relevant to this exemption. No enforcement actions are expected.Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposesis not applicable to this exemption request. This is the first exemptionfrom the requirement of a tolerance for this biorational nematicide.The biorational nematicide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on theinformation considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of theexemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation isestablished as set forth below.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objection.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this proposed rule fromthe requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 17, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
