Drexel also agreed to sever its ties with financier MichaelMilken, who was indicted on racketeering charges last month.   And the company announced that John Shad, a former SEC chiefinstrumental in starting an intense investigation more than twoyears ago that led to the fraud charges, would become its chairman.   The Drexel-SEC pact clears the way for Drexel's previouslyannounced agreement to plead guilty to criminal fraud charges andpay $650 million in fines and restitution to settle another casewith the Justice Department.   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been the biggesttarget of a federal crackdown on securities fraud stemming from theIvan Boesky insider trading scandal. Boesky, a notorious speculatornow in federal prison, has been a leading source of evidenceagainst Drexel, Milken and others.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder called the settlement ``the mostfar-reaching relief ever obtained by the commission against a majorregulated entity.''   ``We think it achieves everything that's needed for theprotection of the investing public,'' SEC Enforcement Director GaryLynch said. ``It will also give us the ability to bring otherpeople to justice that might not be brought to justice if we hadstayed at war for another three to five years.''   Drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying thelargest penalties ever in a securities case and making``comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes.''   ``Today's agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commissioncaps more than two difficult years for the firm and positionsDrexel Burnham Lambert to move forward and fully devote ourenergies to our clients' needs,'' Drexel said in a statement.   ``As a financial institution, we know that our employees,clients and creditors ... must have total confidence in ourintegrity,'' Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph said in thestatement.   Under the settlement, Drexel will ``disassociate'' itself fromMilken, whose pioneering marketing of high-yield securitiescommonly known as junk bonds vaulted Drexel into the forefront of1980s financial powerhouses. Drexel also agreed to either fireMilken's brother Lowell, a senior aide, or put him on leave.   The company and its employees are barred from entering into anyprivate business deals directly or indirectly with Milken. Currentpartnerships with Milken _ such as ownership of Drexel's BeverlyHills, Calif., junk bond headquarters _ do not have to be dissolved.   Drexel also will pay $15 million in civil penalties, an amountalready accounted for under the total $650 million in penalties italready had agreed to pay the government.   Drexel reached the settlement without admitting or denyingguilt. Admitting guilt would have made the firm more vulnerable toprivate lawsuits by investors who claim they were defrauded.   The SEC said in a statement it also had reached a settlementwith Cary Maultasch, a former Drexel employee who was named in thecase and reportedly emerged as an important cooperating witness.   The 184-page SEC complaint, filed in September, detailed 21alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 portraying Drexel,Michael Milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged instock manipulation and insider trading.   Under terms of the settlement:   _Drexel will appoint a ``special reviewer'' to oversee itsinvestment-company-related operations.   _Drexel agrees to be placed on administrative probation forthree years, meaning the SEC will give the firm's operationsspecial scrutiny during that period.   _The SEC and an independent accounting firm to be picked by theSEC will monitor Drexel's junk bond activities for three years.   _Drexel will move its equity and convertible securities tradingfunctions from Beverly Hills, Calif., to New York.   _Drexel's junk bond operation will remain in Beverly Hills butwill be overseen by a member of a special committee.   _Drexel will create a committee to oversee internal functions ofDrexel. A majority of the members of the committee will be outsidedirectors of the firm.   _The SEC will have a say in who becomes Drexel's chairman for aperiod of three years.   _Drexel will purchase Michael Milken's equity interest in theinvestment firm and, if Lowell Milken is no longer employed byDrexel, it will purchase his equity interest as well.   _Drexel will add three independent directors to the firm, whowill oversee internal controls and audit, accounting and complianceand serve as a disciplinary committee.   Shad will count as one of the independent directors. The othertwo will be Roderick Hills, also a former SEC chairman, who ischairman of Manchester Group Ltd.; and Ralph Saul, a formerpresident of the American Stock Exchange and former Cigna Corp.chairman, who is chairman of Peers andamp; Co.   Negotiations between Drexel and the SEC began in January butsnagged repeatedly on several issues concering the future of theMilkens.   It appeared that the 98-count racketeering and fraud indictmentof the Milkens on March 29 helped clear the way for the pact. BothMilkens pleaded innocent last week.</TEXT></DOC>
