Chen said it would take several months before the full economicimpact of the strife becomes known.   However, he acknowledged that the the civil unrest in Beijing andother major Chinese cities already has caused widespread work andtransportation disruptions, increased food prices and led to anxietyamong Western investors and creditors about the prospects for futureinvestment in the country.   Chen repeated assurances already made by other Chinese officialsthat the country intends to honor all its obligations to foreigncreditors.   ``I think there is absolutely not a problem in this field. We areconfident. The Bank of China has a very good reputation (withforeign creditors),'' he said.   Chen said that the cost of servicing China's estimated $30billion foreign debt amounted to about 11 percent of China's foreignincome.   He said inflation remained China's biggest economic problem, andhe estimated that retail prices in the first quarter of this yearrose at an annual rate of more than 20 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
