Two Arabs were reported killed and 13 wounded.   Confrontations between stone-throwing youths and Israelisoldiers took place despite army curfews that confined more thanhalf the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Stripto their homes.   Curfews and blocking of roads from the territories for a thirdday were designed to keep Palestinians from entering Israel duringMemorial Day on Tuesday, when Israelis honored their war dead, andthe Independence Day observance.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was hospitalized for tests aftercomplaining of tiredness. Earlier, he elaborated on his peaceproposal in Independence Day interviews broadcast Wednesday onIsrael radio. It calls for elections in the occupied lands forrepresentatives to negotiate with Israel on limited Palestinianself-rule.   That ``interim agreement'' would be followed in two years bytalks on a final settlement.   His comments in Hebrew and English appeared contradictory onwhether Israel was willing to talk with Palestinians intent on anindependent state.   In Hebrew, after repeating his refusal to deal the PalestineLiberation Organization, Shamir said: ``We have to talk to peoplewho are interested in a solution ... those who don't insist on thisminimum demand for a Palestinian state.''   In English, when asked how Palestinians could be persuaded tonegotiate if Israel insisted on continued rule in the occupiedlands, he said the negotiators could propose whatever they wished.   ``Therefore,'' he added, ``I can suppose that the Israeli sidewill propose Israeli sovereignty and the Arab side will ask forPalestinian sovereignty.'' Both the PLO and leading Palestinians inthe occupied lands have rejected Shamir's proposal on grounds itdoes not recognize their national aspirations.   Also Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry official said the UnitedStates is pressuring Israel to calm violence in the occupiedterritories and proceed with Shamir's elections plan.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmedreports that Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a letterten days ago to his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Arens, expressingsupport for elections as part of a peace plan.   Jewish settlers used Independence Day to inaugurate two newsettlements in the occupied West Bank.   Organizers said about 50 families will live in Ofarim, in thenorth, and Tzorfim, near Jerusalem. They are among eight newsettlements approved for construction this year and join about 130existing settlements, which are home to about 70,000 Jews.   Western governments, including the United States, see thesettlements as an obstacle to peace.   In renewed clashes in the occupied West Bank, troops shot andkilled two Palestinians, an army spokesman said. The spokesman alsoconfirmed two Arabs wounded and said other reports were beingchecked.   Arabs sources reported a total of 13 wounded in the occupiedlands on Wednesday.   The army spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity,said one Palestinian was shot and killed as he was about to throw afirebomb at an army jeep on the Jerusalem-Bethlehem highway.Another Arab was wounded, the spokesman said.   Arab reporters told a slightly different story. They said thePalestinian was shot and killed while he and some companions werestanding along the highway throwing stones at cars driven byIsraeli settlers. The cars were flying large blue-and-white Israeliflags from their rooftops for Independence Day.   An Israeli paramilitary border policeman spotted thePalestinians and opened fire, killing one of the stone-throwers,the reporters said. They also reported two Arabs wounded.   Arab hospital officials identified the slain man as 24-year-oldSayez Ismaeel Musa. They said he was fatally wounded in the chest.   In the town of Ramallah, troops opened fire to disperse about200 Palestinians who were throwing stones, killing one and woundinganother, the army spokesman said.   Mahoud Sami Abdul Ranni, 17, arrived dead at Ramallah Hospitalwith a gunshot wound to the chest, hospital officials said.   The deaths brought to 469 the number of Palestinians killed inthe 17-month uprising. Twenty-one Israelis have also died in theviolence.   Elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 10 Palestinians werewounded by army gunfire, Arab sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
