(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relatives of hostages held in Lebanonsaid Monday they hope the Bush administration is intensifyingefforts to secure the captives' release, but don't really know whatis being done.   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' John Anderson, brother of hostageTerry Anderson, said at a news conference during a weekend oftributes to the hostages.   ``George Bush, both in his inaugural address and a pressconference afterward, without prompting, brought up the hostageissue,'' Anderson, of Ocala, Fla., said. ``Reagan never did once, infour years.''   When pressed on the issue at news conferences, Reagan invariablysaid the government was pursuing the matter but that it would bedangerous to talk about specifics.   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, has been a hostage four years, longer than any ofthe eight other Americans being held by pro-Iranian extremists inLebanon.   John Anderson was joined by Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa.,whose brother Joseph has been a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986;Estelle Ronneburg of Boise, Idaho, whose son, Jesse Turner, wastaken hostage Jan. 24, 1987; and Elaine and David Collett, of NewYork, the wife and son of British hostage Alec Collett, who wascaptured March 25, 1985.   Other Americans believed held hostage in Lebanon are Alann Steen,Thomas Sutherland, Frank Reed, Edward Tracy, Robert Polhill and U.S.Marine Lt. Col. Richard Higgins.   The relatives were in Oakland County, north of Detroit, Sundayand Monday for events publicizing the hostages' plight. Theactivities were planned by Ernest May of Pontiac and the city'sBicentennial of the Constitution Committee.   All five wore yellow ribbons that read ``Free the Hostages,'' andsat next to pictures of their hostage relative at the newsconference.   ``I feel President Bush has a little different attitude thanReagan,'' said Cicippio.   Cicippio said he felt former President Reagan shied away from thehostage issue, and that the government fails to keep relatives fullyinformed.   ``I hear from the State Department about every two weeks,''Cicippio said, adding the news he receives from the governmentalready has been in the media.   Collett acknowledged that disclosing information about any plansaimed at gaining release of the hostages was tricky.   ``It's very difficult,'' Collett said. ``They cannot make publicvarious things they're doing. They're very sensitive issues.''</TEXT></DOC>
