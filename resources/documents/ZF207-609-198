 Few information systems managers have theanswer at hand.andM;The inability to answer that question implies that source code is notconsidered an asset.andP;  If it were an asset, it would be controlled.andM;Each chair, each desk and each reel of tape is recorded in an inventory.andO;Periodic counts are made to verify that none of the assets are lost.andP;  If oneor more of the assets is lost, it is investigated.andM;During the early 1960s, corporations fought with the Internal Revenue Serviceover the status of source code.andP;  The IRS wanted organizations to capitalizesource code and treat it as an asset.andP;  Corporation officials argued that thedevelopment of business systems always had been considered an operatingexpense.andP;  The computer was merely a new method of developing office systems,they said.andM;Trick or Treat?andM;The corporations won and were able to count the cost of developing computersystems as an expense.andP;  The result was that systems were not treated asassets.andM;What difference does it make whether source code is treated as capital or anexpense?andP;  Let's examine a few of the consequences.andM;First, expenses are resources that have been consumed; assets are resourcesthat have been invested for the future.andP;  When source code is counted as anexpense, it is considered to be a consumed or used resource.andP;  Thus there isno need to record and track it.andP;  If it were considered an asset, it would betreated as an office chair, desk or computer tape.andM;Second, assets are managed; expenses are not.andP;  When one acquires an officebuilding, a computer center, a data library or any other significant asset, amanager is assigned to oversee that asset.andP;  Someone runs the computer room;someone runs the data library; someone runs an office.andP;  But rarely do we findsomeone managing an organization's source code master.andP;  It is not managed inthe same way as other assets.andP;  No one is responsible for maintaining andprotecting that asset.andM;Third, assets have a capital budget for maintenance; expenses do not.andO;Organizations allocate money to keep major assets in shape.andP;  Programs on thesource master are permitted to deteriorate.andM;Software doesn't break down in the same way a physical asset deteriorates.andO;But the damage can be just as extensive, and perhaps more costly to fix.andM;In my opinion, corporations did a great disservice to the information systemsindustry by treating software as an expense.andM;Take Stock of SoftwareandM;My recommendation to information systems managers is to begin viewingsoftware as an asset.andP;  This would require managers to take the followingthree actions:andM;* Take inventory of software resources.andP;  The code needs to be recorded bynumber of lines of source code, by programs and by information systems.andM;* Appoint a software manager to ensure the asset remains current.andP;  Softwareusually wears out structurally, not functionally.andP;  As the structure becomesobsolete, the effectiveness of the software declines.andP;  The software managerwould oversee programs such as re-engineering and reverse engineering.andM;* Establish a software capital asset budget.andP;  A portion of money would be setaside each year to preserve and extend the life of each asset.andP;  Just asbuildings and grounds are not left to deteriorate, the software budget wouldprevent software structure from deteriorating.andM;This budget would be used for projects such as re-engineering source codefrom unstructured to structured code; bringing old systems up to currentstandards; improving software documentation; and improving and upgradingsoftware test plans.andM;Treating software as an asset should provide three major benefits to theinformation systems department.andP;  First, attitudes would be changed about thevalue of software.andP;  As its importance increases, the programmers and analystswill take their work more seriously.andM;Second, the cost of software maintenance should drop because thearchitecture, the documentation, and the test are up to date.andM;Third, and perhaps most important, information systems can be more responsiveto customers' needs because changes can be incorporated more quickly and withfewer defects.andM;Yes, software is an asset, and it should be so treated.andM;William E.
