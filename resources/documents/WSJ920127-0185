Scientific truth is neutral, it belongs to no one.Beyond Pythagorean geometry and the laws of Newton, most ofthe &quot;truths&quot; brought forth by scientific activity are limitedin scope and certainly subject to interpretation. The samefacts can be and often are subject to differentinterpretations relative to their meaning and significance.It is the nature of science to be so.   The problem arises when science is used as a basis forregulatory activity. No one can argue that sound regulatorypolicy should not be based on &quot;good science.&quot; Becauseregulation typically has adverse economic consequences, itinvites disputation of whatever facts are the basis for theproposed regulatory action. A battle then ensues betweenthose who interpret the facts to support the regulatoryposition and those who claim the facts do not support it.Most science involved in regulatory issues has some degree ofuncertainty associated with it. The question is, of course,how much uncertainty is acceptable in order to still havegood regulatory policy.</LP><TEXT>   It is a common practice for the regulated and those whosupport them (such as your Review andamp; Outlook staff) to claimthat the facts do not support the proposed regulatoryactivity. Typically, the challenge is made that we need moredata. The reality, of course, is that there is never enoughdata to satisfy the regulated (witness the tobaccocompanies). It is a typical tactic used by defense attorneys-- exploit all the unknowns and any seeming contradictions.Confuse the jury.   There are very few absolutes in science. Demandingabsolutes is not good science. Good science cannot be definedby the regulated and their stable of attorneys and thescientists whom they provide support either directly orindirectly.   Elizabeth Whelan, of whom you made reference, is ascientist, as am I. She heads an organization whose majortenet I would describe as being: &quot;I have never met a chemicalof considerable economic value that was not safe.&quot; It isself-serving to argue that Ms. Whelan and other members ofher industry-sponsored group somehow have the market on &quot;goodscience&quot; and that scientists supporting a pro-regulationposition are therefore proponents of science that is somehowless than &quot;good.&quot;   Thad Godish   Professor, Natural Resources   Ball State University   Muncie, Ind.   ---   Your editorial was interesting to this wildlife biologist.Having worked with a genetically engineered rabies vaccine,two endangered species and the realm of anti-huntingsilliness, many of the names and circumstances in the piecewere familiar to me. Amid the examples of how the scientificmethod has been abused in policy debates, however, I couldfind no evidence that you enlightened your readership on thematter.   The problem is the unclear use of names and phrases. Youdid not distinguish between a scientist who contributes to adebate and a debater who sways scientific results in supportof an agenda. The central point is that the label &quot;scientist&quot;has been misapplied. Is Jeremy Rifkin a scientist or anadvocate? What's the difference between &quot;advocates of thespotted owl&quot; and ornithologists?   If you recognize a scientist as anyone claiming&quot;above-average powers of insight,&quot; then you miss the wholeconcept of science. Insight is secondary to the discipline ofstating results along with assumptions and probabilities oferror. A true scientist, unlike a true advocate, will alwayspoint out that every result was observed under specificcircumstances, and is subject to the chance it was a fluke(Type I statistical error), or that the failure to observe aresult was an oversight (Type II error).   For us scientists to retain (in some cases, rebuild) ourcredibility, we need the help of the media to reinforce thedistinction between a scientist and a spin doctor. AsVoltaire said, &quot;If you would converse with me, define yourterms.&quot; Scientists qualify statements with the assumptions ofthe studies that generated them, and include the probabilityof a mistake. Advocates predict outcomes and argue simplecauses and effects.   Gregory T.M.
