As a resultof the comments received, over $1.5 million which ORR previously had plannedto use for discretionary initiatives has been added to the amount allocatedby formula. Adjustments have been made in the estimated refugee populationsof four States as a result of evidence submitted by those States.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Amounts Available for Allocation </ITAG>The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) expects to have available $65,694,000in FY 1988 refugee/entrant social service funds. This amount is based uponthe Continuing Resolution for FY 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202) and the accompanyingConference Report (H. Rept. 100-498). Of the total of $65,694,000, the Director of ORR will make available toStates during FY 1988 $57,073,451 (86.9%) under the allocation formulasset out in this notice. These funds will be made available for the purposeof providing social services to refugees and entrants. The final allocationamounts have been adjusted as a result of ORR's addition of $1,573,451to the formula allocation and after taking into consideration populationadjustments based on evidence submitted by four States. All allocation figures include both refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrantssince both populations may be served through funds addressed in this notice.(A State must, however, have an approved State plan for the Cuban/HaitianEntrant Program in order to use funds on behalf of entrants as well asrefugees.) Of the $57,073,451 covered by this notice, the Director will allocate fundsdirectly to States in the following manner: andbullet; $54,573,451 will be allocated on the basis of each State's proportionof the national population of refugees and entrants who had been in theU.S. 3 years or less as of October 1, 1987 (including a floor of $75,000for States which have small refugee/entrant populations). andbullet; $2,500,000 will be allocated to each State on the basis of itsproportion of the 3-year refugee/entrant population (including a flooramount of $5,000 to States with small refugee-entrant populations) in orderto provide an incentive for States to fund refugee/entrant mutual assistanceassociations (MAAs). A written assurance that these optional funds willbe used for MAAs is required in order for a State to receive the funds.Guidance to States regarding this assurance is provided below. The use of the 3-year population base in the allocation formula is requiredby section 6(a)(3) of the Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-605) which amended section 412(c) of the Immigration and NationalityAct to require that the ``funds available for a fiscal year for grantsand contracts [for social services] * * * shall be allocated among theStates based on the total number of refugees (including children and adults)who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginningof such fiscal year and who are actually residing in each State (takinginto account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal year.''The approximately $8,600,000 in remaining social service funds is expectedto be used by ORR on a discretionary basis to provide funds for individualprojects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency ofthe refugee resettlement program.The discretionary funds will support specific program activities designedto improve the delivery of services to refugees. Announcements of the availabilityof funding and grant application procedures for some projects have beenissued (Availability of Grants to States to Implement Community/FamilyStability Projects, ORR Regional Letter issued to April 29, 1988; Availabilityof Funding for Grants to States to Implement Favorable Alternate SitesDemonstration Projects, Memorandum to State Refugee Coordinators issuedOctober 1, 1984; and Availability of Funding for Planned Secondary Resettlementof Refugees, 50 FR 20038, May 13, 1985). ORR is also continuing the KeyStates Initiative, which began last year, for projects to increase employmentand self-support in States that have a high rate of dependence of refugeeson cash assistance.Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population,social service programs are not limited to refugees who have been in theU.S. only 3 years. States may provide services without regard to an individualrefugee's or entrant's length of residence.ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizenssince they are not covered under the refugee and entrant legislation (exceptthat under current regulations services may be provided to a U.S.-bornminor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or entrantsor, if only one parent is present, in which that parent is a refugee orentrant).In accordance with ORR's ``Statement of Program Goals, Priorities and Standardsfor State-Administered Refugee Resettlement Program'' issued March 1, 1984,funds awarded under this notice for the basic and MAA incentive allocationsare subject (as were FY 1985-1987 funds) to a requirement that at least85% of a State's award be used for employment services, English languagetraining, and case management services, reflecting the Congressional objectivethat ``employable refugees should be placed in jobs as soon as possibleafter their arrival in the United States'' and that social service fundsbe focused on these types of services. (Immigration and Nationality Act,section 412(a)(1)(B).) As in previous years, ORR will consider granting,under specific circumstances, a waiver of this provision. In order to receivea waiver, a State must meet either of the following two conditions:1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR thattwo of the following three circumstances exist: The cash assistance ratefor time-eligible refugees/entrants in the State is below the nationalaverage for all time-eligible refugees/entrants in the U.S.; less than85% of the State's social service allocation is sufficient to meet allemployment-related needs of the State's refugees/entrants; and/or thereare non-employment-related service needs which are so extreme as to justifyan allowance above the basic 15%. <T3>Or </T3>2. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the Immigration and NationalityAct, as amended by the Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L.99-605), the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or inconsultation with local governments) which the Director determines providesfor the maximum appropriate provision of employment-related services for,and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performancestandards established under section 106 of the Job Training PartnershipAct.States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to payfor social services which are provided to refugees/entrants who participatein alternative projects. The Continuing Resolution for FY 1985 (Pub. L.98-473) amended section 412(e)(7)(A) of the Immigration and NationalityAct to provide that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary [of HHS] shall develop and implement alternative projectsfor refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months,under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support[social] services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encouragesself-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordinationamong the resettlement agencies and service providers.</ITAG>This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Departmenthas already issued a separate notice in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> with respect to applications for such projects(50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does notcontain certain provisions for the allocation of additional social servicefunds beyond the amounts made available by this notice. Therefore a Statewhich may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take noteof this in planning its use of social service funds being allocated underthe present notice.Finally, ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization ofrefugee mutual assistance associations (MAAs) in the provision of socialservices promotes appropriate use of services as well as the effectivenessof the overall service system. This belief is reinforced by the interestin MAAs which has developed under similar incentive funds awarded to Statesin previous years. Therefore additional funds which would be targeted specificallyto these organizations have been included as an optional award to Stateswhich would use them for this purpose.In order to receive the MAA incentive funds, the appropriate State agencyofficial must provide written assurance to the Office of Refugee Resettlementthat the following conditions will be observed by the State agency in usingfunds made available to the State under this special allocation:1. That such funds will be used to fund refugee/entrant mutual assistanceassociations for the direct provision of services to refugee and entrantclients.2. That the MAA incentive allocation is subject to and included under ORR'srequirement that 85 percent of the total amount of social service fundsallocated by this notice to a State be used for priority services, as defnedelsewhere in this notice.3. That the State agency will observe the following definition of a mutalassistance association:a. The organization must be legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization;<T3> and</T3>b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governingboard of the mutual assistance association will be comprised of refugees/entrantsor former refugees/entrants.4. That the State agency will assist MAAs in seeking other public and/orprivate funds for the provision of services for refugee and entrant clientsin subsequent years.Written assurances should be sent to the Director, Office of Refugee Resettlement,Room 1229 Switzer Building, 330 C Street, SW, Washington, DC 20201, witha duplicate copy to the appropriate Family Support Administration (FSA)Regional Administrator. States must respond by 30 days from the date ofpublication of this notice in order to avail themselves of this specialallocation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussions of Comments Received</ITAG>We received three letters of comment in response to the notice of the proposedallocation to States of FY 1988 funds for social services for refugeesand Cuban/Haitian entrants. The comments are summarized below and are followedin each case by the Department's response.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter objected to the use of a formula basedon refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less, stating that 60%of the refugees who are receiving assistance in the commenter's area havebeen in the U.S. more than 3 years.<T3>Response</T3>: The 3-year formula is required by statute.<T3>Comment</T3>: Two commenters recommended that the approximately $10million which ORR proposed to use for discretionary purposes be allocatedinstead according to the formula. The comments stated that this would aidStates in addressing the reductions in funding for social services andState administration under the FY 1988 Continuing Resolution on Appropriations.<T3>Response</T3>: After careful consideration, we have concluded thatit would not be appropriate to distribute all of the discretionary fundsunder the allocation formula because of the importance of continuing anumber of special efforts including the Key States Initiative to reducewelfare dependence and the Community/Family Stability Projects to provideservices in on-impacted communities which are favorable locations for refugees.Other initiatives to provide services to newly arriving Hmong refugeesfrom Laos and to Amerasians from Vietnam are also important. These andother discretionary projects, which are intended to improve the effectivenessand efficiency of the refugee resettlement program, fully merit the useof funds for these purposes and are able to address particular needs ina more flexible and productive manner than could be achieved by simplyadding funds to the formula allocation. Most of the discretionary fundsfor special initiatives are awarded to States.In response to the commenters' recommendation, we have, however, re-examinedthe amount of funds required this year for ORR's high-priority discretionaryactivities and have concluded that $1,573,451 can appropriately be addedto the allocation formula. This addition brings the total amount allocatedby this notice to $57,073,451. This is 98% of the $58,224,410 allocatedin FY 1987. The FY 1988 formula allocations comprise 86.9% of the appropriationavailable for social services as compared with 84.9% in FY 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Allocation Formula</ITAG>Of the funds available for FY 1988 for social services, $54,573,451 willbe allocated to States in accordance with the formula specified below.A State's allowable allocation will be calculated as follows:1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be availablefor this purpose; divided by_2. The total number of refugees and entrants who arrived in the UnitedStates not more than 3 years prior to the beginning of the fiscal yearfor which the funds are appropriated, as shown by the ORR Refugee DataSystem. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied by_3. The number of refugees and entrants in item 2, above, in the State asof October 1, 1987, adjusted for estimated secondary migration.The calculation above will yield the formula allocation for each State.MAA incentive award supplements are allocated on the same 3-year populationbasis as that used in the social service formula. These funds will be madeavailable contingent upon letters of assurance from States, as describedpreviously.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Basis of Refugee and Entrant Population Estimates</ITAG>The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1988 are basedon data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee Data System, adjustedas of October 1, 1987, for estimated secondary migration. The data baseincludes refugees of all nationalities as well as Cuban and Haitian entrantsresettled after September 30, 1984. Figures on the numbers of entrantsresettled are maintained by the ORR Florida office.For fiscal year 1988, ORR's formula allocations to the States for socialservices for refugees are based on the numbers of refugees who arrived,and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during thepreceding three fiscal years: 1985, 1986, and 1987. Therefore estimateshave been developed of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrivalor resettlement dates between October 1, 1984, and September 30, 1987,who are throught to be living in each State as of October 1, 1987. Thepopulation estimates for the FY 1988 allocations cover refugees of allnationalities and Cuban/Haitian entrants.All participating States submitted data on their secondary in-migrationon Form ORR-11 for use in adjusting these population estimates. The totalreported migration was summed, yielding a net migration figure for eachState. This figure, the minimum documented migration affecting each State,was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revisedpopulation estimate. This estimate was converted into a percentage of thetotal 3-year refugee population. The percentage distribution was comparedwith the percentage distribution generated from the refugee child countdone by the U.S. Department of Education in April-May 1987. Where a significantdiscrepancy between the two percentage distributions existed which couldnot be explained except by secondary migration, a further adjustment wasmade to the State's estimated population. The population estimates of 12States were adjusted in this manner. Finally, each State's population wasdeflated by approximately 0.68% to constrain the sum of the State figuresto the known national total. Due to the adjustments made for populationappeals, the population estimates for most States are changed slightlyfrom the notice of proposed allocations. Four States submitted convincingevidence of larger time-eligible populations than had been estimated previously,and their population estimates were revised accordingly.Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and thencombined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant population for eachState.Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year population of refugees and entrants,as of October 1, 1987 (col. 1); the formula amounts which the populationestimates yield (col. 2); the total allocation amounts after allowing forthe minimum amounts (col. 3); and the amounts available as an incentiveto States to use MAAs as service providers (col. 4).<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
