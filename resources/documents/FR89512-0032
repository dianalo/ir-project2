Beach mice occur only along the Atlantic and Gulf coastsof Florida and the Gulf coast of Alabama. Three subspecies of Gulf coastbeach mice, the Alabama beach mouse (<T3>Peromyscus polionotus ammobates</T3>), Perdido Key beach mouse (<T3>P. p. trissyllepsis</T3>), and the Choctawhatchee beach mouse (<T3>P. p. allophrys</T3>), have already been listed as endangered speciespursuant to the Act (June 6, 1985; 50 FR 23872). The present rule liststwo of the Atlantic coast subspecies. One of these, the Anastasia Islandbeach mouse (<T3>P. p. phasma</T3>), is listed as an endangered species; the other,the southeastern beach mouse (<T3>P. p. niveiventris</T3>), is listed as threatened. Both occur onlyin Florida. The Anastasia Island beach mouse was known historically fromthe mouth of the St. Johns River, Duval County, south to Matanzas Inlet,St. Johns County. The southeastern beach mouse formerly occurred from Ponce(Mosquito) Inlet, Volusia County, south to Hollywood Beach, Broward County(Humphrey 1987). The Anastasia Island beach mouse (<T3>Peromyscus polionotus phasma</T3>) was named by Bangs in 1898 as afull species,<T3> Peromyscus phasma</T3>. Osgood (1909) relegated it to subspecificrank under the species <T3>Peromyscus polionotus</T3>. It is one of the largest of the beach mice,with ten adults from the type locality averaging 138.5 mm. in total lengthwith an average tail length of 53 mm. (Osgood 1909). Like all beach mice,it is considerably paler than inland races of<T3> P. polionotus</T3>. The coloration is light ochraceous buff on theback, with pure white underparts, a unicolor tail, and rather indistinctwhite markings on the nose and face (Howell, unpubl. ms.,<T3> circa</T3> 1940). The type locality is Point Romo, Anastasia Island,St. Johns County, Florida (Hall 1981). The southeastern beach mouse (<T3>Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris</T3>) was named by Chapman as<T3> Hesperomys niveiventris</T3> in 1889. Bangs placed it in the genus<T3> Peromyscus</T3> in 1898, and Osgood (1909) relegated it to subspeciesrank under<T3> Peromyscus polionotus.</T3> This is the largest of the beach mice,with 10 adults averaging 139 mm. in total length and 52 mm. in tail length(Osgood 1909). It is slightly darker and more buffy than<T3> Peromyscus polionotus phasma</T3>, but still considerably paler thanmost inland subspecies (it is similar in coloration to inland <T3>P. p. rhoadsi</T3>, but is much larger in size) (Howell, unpubl. ms.,<T3> circa</T3> 1940). The type locality is Oak Lodge, east peninsula oppositeMicco, Brevard County, Florida (Hall 1981). Both<T3> Peromyscus polionotus phasma</T3> and<T3> P. p. niveiventris</T3> are restricted to sand dunes mainly vegetatedby sea oats (<T3>Uniola paniculata</T3>) and dune panic grass (<T3>Paspalum amarulum</T3>), and to the adjoining scrub, characterizedby oaks (<T3>Quercus</T3> sp.) and sand pine (<T3>Pinus clausa</T3>) or palmetto (<T3>Serenoa repens</T3>) (Humphrey and Barbour 1981, Humphrey 1987). Extineand Stout (1987) studied dispersion and movements of<T3> Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris</T3> on Merritt Island. The habitatof the mice consisted of three contiguous zones of vegetation running parallelwith the beach and dune lines. Zone 1 was seaward and supported sea oats;Zone 2 was characterized by clumps of palmetto and sea grape (<T3>Coccoloba uvifera</T3>), and expanses of open sand; Zone 3 was interiorand consisted of dense scrub dominated by palmetto, sea grape, and waxmyrtle (<T3>Myrica cerifera</T3>). Zones 2 and 3 were found to be the preferredhabitats of the beach mice, whereas Zone 1 was marginal. The following information pertains mostly to Gulf coast beach mice, butprobably applies to subspecies along the Atlantic coast, since all beachmice are morphologically similar and live in similar habitats.Blair (1951) found that food plants most utilized by beach mice are variousbeach grasses and sea oats. The fruits of beach grass are readily availableto the mice, but those of sea oats are usually obtainable only after theyhave been blown down by heavy winds. These foods are often found storedin mouse burrows. Beach mice also probably eat invertebrates from timeto time, especially in late spring and early summer when seeds are scarce(Ehrhart <T3>in </T3>Layne, 1978). Beach mice are burrow-inhabiting animals. Ehrhart (<T3>in </T3>Layne 1978), writing about the Atlantic coast subspecies <T3>P. p. decoloratus, </T3>noted that burrow entrances are usually placedon the sloping side of a dune at the base of a shrub or clump of grass.Old burrows of ghost crabs are utilized, but more commonly the mice excavatetheir own burrows (Blair 1951). The home range may contain up to 20 burrows,which are used for refuge, nesting, and food storage. Along the Gulf coast, much breeding activity was evident from Novemberthrough early January, when many immature animals were present (Blair 1951).Litters ranged from two to seven, averaging four; mice reached reproductivematurity as early as 6 weeks of age. In the laboratory, Bowen (1968) foundthat a female beach mouse could produce over 80 young during her lifetime,with litters produced regularly at 26-day intervals. Mortality of the youngis very high, however. Blair (1951) found that only 19.5 percent of beachmice on the Gulf coast survived more than 4 months. Similar breeding activityfor the two beach mice considered under this rule can be expected. Myers (1983) reported that raccoons, skunks, snakes, great blue herons,domestic dogs, and domestic cats could be beach mouse predators on theGulf coast dunes. These species are also potential beach mouse predatorson the Atlantic coast. Hall (1981) cites two historical records for the Anastasia Island beachmouse: The type locality at Point Romo, Anastasia Island, St. Johns County;and the beach dunes at the border of the St. Johns and Duval County line.This subspecies, therefore, could have ranged along the ocean dunes fromthe mouth of the St. Johns River in Duval County south to the end of AnastasiaIsland at Matanzas Inlet, St. Johns County. A recent survey of this subspeciesby Humphrey (1987) located the mouse only on Anastasia Island, where itsremaining habitat is fragmented and discontinuous, and populations aresmall. Much former habitat on Anastasia Island has been converted to lawnor concrete associated with development of houses and condominiums. The original distribution of the southeastern beach mouse was along beachdunes from Ponce (Mosquito) Inlet, Volusia County, south along the coastto Hollywood Beach, Broward County. Humphrey (1987) found the mouse commonat Cape Canaveral and in smaller numbers at Cape Canaveral National Seashore.From Sebastian Inlet to Hutchinson Island, only a few small, scatteredremnant populations survive. A survey of southeastern beach mouse habitatconducted at four State-owned recreation areas by the Florida Departmentof Natural Resources during the spring and summer of 1988 yielded the followingresults: one southeastern beach mouse was trapped at the Ft. Pierce InletState Recreation Area (St. Lucie County), four were taken at the SebastianInlet State Recreation Area (Indian River County), and none were caughtat the MacArthur Beach State Park (Palm Beach County) or the St. LucieInlet State Park (Martin County). The latter two areas lie south of HutchinsonIsland, where nearly all beach dunes have been destroyed by housing andcondominium developments. A third Atlantic coast beach mouse subspecies, <T3>Peromyscus polionotus decoloratus, </T3>formerly occurred between theranges of <T3>P. p. phasma </T3>to the north and <T3>P. p. niveiventris </T3>to the south. This very pale race lived onthe beach dunes from Matanzas Inlet, St. Johns County south to Ponce (Mosquito)Inlet, Volusia County. Humphrey and Barbour (1981) searched extensivelyfor <T3>decoloratus </T3>but were unable to find any existing populations.They concluded that habitat destruction and alteration throughout its entirerange had brought about its extinction. <T3>Peromyscus polionotus decoloratus </T3>appeared as a category 3A species,one that is probably extinct, in the notice of review for vertebrate animalspublished September 18, 1985, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 37958). In this same notice, the othertwo beach mice were placed in category 2, indicating they were being consideredas candidates for listing. A proposed rule for classifying the AnastasiaIsland beach mouse as endangered and the southeastern beach mouse as threatenedwas published on July 5, 1988 (53 FR 25185). <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the July 5, 1988, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interestedparties were requested to submit factual reports or information that mightcontribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate State agencies,county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and otherinterested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper noticesinviting general comment were published on July 23, 1988, in the ``FortPierce News-Tribune;'' on July 24, 1988, in the ``Stuart News'' and ``DaytonaBeach Journal;'' and on July 30, 1988, in the ``St. Augustine Record,''``Florida Today'' (Melbourne), the ``Vero Beach Press-Journal,'' and the``Palm Beach Post.'' Eight comments were received: three were from Federalagencies, three from State agencies, one from a county department, andone from an individual. Only one expressed opposition to the listing. The one opposing comment came from the U.S. Air Force's Patrick Air ForceBase in Brevard County. In a letter dated August 19, 1988, the Acting DeputyRange/Base Civil Engineer stated that the Air Force was very concernedabout the possible listing of the mice. He felt the listing of this ``vermin''species would seriously hamper the Air Force with its mission accomplishmentat Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. He further stated that the listingmight not only delay or prevent future project development but could furtherobligate and impose mitigative and financial type actions on both the Fishand Wildlife Service and the Air Force. According to this commentor, thelisting would also have a negative impact on future beach and dune restorationprojects. The Service responds with the following four points. (1) The southeasternbeach mouse is not a ``vermin'' species since it is neither destructiveto human interests nor annoying or injurious to human health. The Servicebelieves that the Air Force is confusing this rare and totally innocuousmouse with the very common and often obnoxious house mouse <T3>(Mus musculus). </T3>(2) The Service is required by law to list anyspecies as endangered or threatened if it meets the Act's criteria forsuch listing; there being no alternative in such cases regardless of whateffect the listing may have on Federal agencies and their activities. (3)There is very little likelihood that the listing will hamper the Cape CanaveralAir Force Station's mission accomplishment. The Service has found throughmany years of experience that the Section 7 consultation process of theAct almost invariably allows Federal activities to proceed (often withonly minor alteration) while still providing necessary protection to endangeredor threatened species. (4) The Service does not believe the listing willhave a negative effect on beach and dune restoration projects; in factthe southeastern beach mouse should benefit from such activities sinceloss of this type of habitat has been a major threat to the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the Anastasia Island beach mouse shouldbe classified as an endangered species, and the southeastern beach mouseas a threatened species. Procedures found at Section 4(a)(1) of the EndangeredSpecies Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the AnastasiaIsland beach mouse (<T3>Peromyscus polionotus phasma</T3>) and the southeastern beach mouse(<T3>Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris</T3>) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range (1) Anastasia Island beach mouse_Published literature records this subspeciesfrom the type locality at Point Romo, Anastasia Island, St. Johns County,and along the beach dunes at the line between Duval and St. Johns Counties(Hall 1981). Therefore, this mouse probably occurred from the mouth ofthe St. Johns River in the north to Anastasia Island in the south. Muchdune habitat along this beach has been developed around Jacksonville andSt. Augustine, and is unsuitable for beach mice. Some suitable habitatoccurs between Ponte Vedra Beach and South Ponte Vedra Beach, St. JohnsCounty, in the Guana River Wildlife Management Area, but Humphrey (1987)was unable to find the mice there. In fact, Bangs reported in 1896 thatthese beach mice were absent from the beaches north of St. Augustine. Humphrey(1987) found populations distributed along the length of Anastasia Island,but reported that much of their former habitat has been lost due to developmentof houses and condominiums. As a result, the remaining habitat is fragmentedand discontinuous, and the populations are small. The number of specimenscaught by Humphrey (live-trapped and released) suggests that viable populationsmay remain only at the ends of Anastasia Island, along the publicly-owneddune grasslands of Anastasia State Recreation Area and Fort Matanzas NationalMonument. Proposed bridge replacement across the Matanzas Inlet, scheduledfor construction early in the 1990's, would affect the small amount ofhabitat (about 25 acres) remaining on Fort Matanzas National Monument.Unless this bridge is carefully planned and constructed, it could be extremelydetrimental to the survival of the mouse in this area. (2) Southeastern beach mouse_This subspecies occurred on the sand dunesalong the beach from Ponce (Mosquito) Inlet, Volusia County in the northto Hollywood Beach, Broward County, in the south (Hall, 1981). Bangs (1898)found it to be ``extremely abundant on all the beaches of the east peninsulafrom Palm Beach at least to Mosquito (Ponce) Inlet,'' and Howell (unpubl.ms., <T3>circa, </T3>1940) found that it was abundant in the 1930's. I.J. Stout(personal communications to Humphrey, 1987) also found it abundant in themiddle and late 1970's on Cape Canaveral. However, by the early 1970's,M.H. Smith (personal communications to Humphrey, 1987) found that mostother populations had disappeared. Humphrey (1987), during extensive trappingfor the subspecies in 1986, captured southeastern beach mice on Cape CanaveralNational Seashore, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, Cape KennedyAir Force Station, the southern half of Sebastian Inlet State RecreationArea and Pepper Park. He reported that the dune grassland at Cape Canaveralis excellent, extensive habitat for beach mice, and that the populationdensity there is apparently high. Northward the habitat narrows to a singledune in Canaveral National Seashore, where population density appears tobe lower. Humphrey's study suggested that beach mice no longer occur onEast Peninsula, where the habitat has been severely disrupted by development.He found that only a few, small, fragmented populations of beach mice remainfrom Sebastian Inlet to Hutchinson Island. The subspecies apparently nolonger occurs in the southern part of its range; beach development hasdestroyed its habitat at Jupiter Island, Palm Beach, Lake Worth, HillsboroInlet, and Hollywood Beach. B. Overutilization for commercial, recreation, scientific, or educationalpurposes Not applicable for either subspecies. C. Disease or predation (1) Anastasia Island beach mouse_House mice (<T3>Mus musculus</T3>) have colonized much, of the dune grassland on whichthe Anastasia Island beach mouse depends for survival. The inference thatthese two mice compete is speculative, but Humphrey and Barbour (1981)presented evidence for competitive exclusion of other subspecies of beachmice by house mice. The situation on Anastasia Island is unprecedentedbecause for the first time beach mice and house mice have been found toco-occur locally. Also, house cats (<T3>Felis catus</T3>) are widespread on Anastasia Island. Blair (1951)and Bowen (1968) felt that house cats were extremely threatening to beachmouse populations on the Florida West Coast. The effects of house miceand house cats on the survival of beach mouse populations are speculativebut may be quite important (Humphrey and Barbour, 1981). Either a competitoror a predator alone can eliminate another species, and the effects of acompetitor and predator together would be additive. On the assumption thatnative beach mice and non-native house mice compete strongly enough tocause competitive exclusion of the former, Humphrey (1987) inferred thatthe survival status of the Anastasia Island beach mouse was precarious.The population on the northern end of Anastasia Island may soon disappear.The population appearing to be at least risk is at Fort Matanzas NationalMonument, where he recorded no house mice. Even there, however, Humphreythought that the likelihood of colonization by house mice was high, andposed a threat to beach mice. (2) Southeastern beach mouse_Humphrey (1987) found no evidence of housemice colonizing southeastern beach mouse habitat, but house cat activitywas widespread in the areas studied. Although the effects of house catpredation on the southeastern beach mouse are unknown, house cats are amajor threat to Gulf Coast beach mice. Blair (1951) felt that predationby house cats was the single most important factor affecting the chancesof survival of beach mice on Santa Rosa Island in the Florida panhandle,and Bowen (1968) was so concerned about the role of domestic cats as predatorson Gulf coast beach mice that he avoided trapping mice wherever he foundcat tracks on the beaches. House cats pose as serious a threat to Atlanticcoast beach mouse populations as they do to those on the Gulf coast.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismsNo current regulatory mechanisms provide protection to the Anastasia Islandbeach mouse, the southeastern beach mouse, or their habitat. Neither subspeciesis listed by the State of Florida, and the Federal Government offers noprotection on Federal lands beyond that which applies to wildlife in generalon such lands. Federal listing will provide protection to the animals themselvesthrough section 9 of the Act, and to their habitat on Federal lands oron private lands where Federal funding or Federal permits are involved.Federal listing of these mice will also effect State protection for themthrough Florida's Cooperative Agreement with the Federal Government undersection 6 of the Act. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued  Existence(1) Anastasia Island beach mouse_Except at each end of Anastasia Island(Fort Matanzas National Monument and the Anastasia State Recreation Area),the habitat is fragmented and discontinuous, and remaining populationsare small. There is apparently little or no gene flow between these smalldisjunct populations and the probability of loss of genetic viability ishigh.  (2) Southeastern beach mouse_According to Humphrey (1987) beach erosionmay soon become a threat to the population of this subspecies on the CanaveralNational Seashore. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesesubspecies in formulating this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferredaction is to list the Anastasia Island beach mouse as an endangered species,and the southeastern beach mouse as a threatened species. Viable populations of Anastasia Island beach mice occur only on the northernand southern ends of Anastasia Island on the Fort Matanzas National Monumentand Anastasia State Recreation Area. The remaining populations have eitheralready been destroyed or face imminent threats from beachfront development.Even at the Anastasia State Recreation Area the mice are threatened bycompetition with house mice and predation by house cats. House cats arealso present at the Fort Matanzas National Monument, and house mice maybecome established in the future. The proposed bridge replacement acrossMatanzas Inlet, if not carried out carefully, could be detrimental to theremaining habitat for this mouse at the Monument. This subspecies is indanger of extinction throughout all of its range and qualifies for listingas endangered. The range of the southeastern beach mouse has been substantially reducedand fragmented by habitat conversion and invasion of exotic animals. Thesethreats are anticipated to continue, and the range of this subspecies ultimatelymay be limited to public lands that are properly managed. Because substantialpopulations remain on the Canaveral National Seashore and on Merritt Island(both publicly owned), the subspecies is not likely to become extinct butrather may become an endangered species within the foreseeable future unlessmanagement and protective measures are instituted. It therefore qualifiesfor listing as a threatened species. Based on current knowledge, all other alternatives to listing the AnastasiaIsland beach mouse as endangered and the southeastern beach mouse as threateneddo not adequately reflect the biological facts and therefore have beenrejected. Critical habitat is not determined for reasons described in thenext section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the AnastasiaIsland beach mouse and the southeastern beach mouse at this time. The onlyviable populations of both subspecies occur on lands managed by Federalor State agencies. These agencies have been informed of the occurrenceof the mice on lands they manage, and must take measures to provide necessaryprotection for both the mice and their habitat. Critical habitat designationwould provide no benefits to the mice beyond that provided by the listingaction. Outside Federal and State lands, these beach mice occur in verysmall, disjunct populations on a number of privately owned parcels of land.To determine each of the small parcels of land as critical habitat wouldbe impossible from a practical standpoint, and might be detrimental tothe populations that inhabit them by calling public attention to the presenceof the mice. Publication of maps and precise descriptions delineating theseareas, as required for a determination of critical habitat, could attractvandals and curiosity seekers to them, possibly damaging the habitat intendedfor protection. Since designation of critical habitat on public lands wouldnot benefit the mice, and designation of critical habitat on private landsmight be harmful to them, it is not prudent to determine critical habitatfor the conservation of the Anastasia Island beach mouse or the southeasternbeach mouse.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Federal agencies that might be affected by the Anastasia Island beachmouse and/or southeastern beach mouse listings include the U.S. Air Force(Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base), NASA (KennedySpace Center), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Merritt Island and HobeSound National Wildlife Refuges) and the National Park Service (CanaveralNational Seashore and Fort Matanzas National Monument), and, perhaps, theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). With the publication of this rule, these Federal agencies need to insurethat activities which they authorize, fund, or carry out, are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of these animals. Except for theNational Park Service at the Fort Matanzas National Monument, and perhapsFEMA, impacts on Federal agencies are expected to be minimal. In the caseof the Fort Matanzas National Monument, the Park Service will need to insurethat a new bridge proposed for the Matanzas Inlet will not jeopardize thesurvival of the Anastasia Island beach mouse on Monument lands. Under the National Flood Insurance Program, FEMA is required to determineif communities are eligible for Federal flood insurance. If the determinationof eligibility for flood insurance by the FEMA authorizes and/or in effectpartially subsidizes construction activity that may affect a listed species,then the FEMA must request the initiation of formal section 7(a)(2) consultation.Whether or not any future FEMA activities will be affected is unknown.There will be no effect on private landowners from the listing unless theiractivities involve use of Federal funds or require Federal permits. Insuch cases, the funding or permitting agency must insure that the activitieswill not jeopardize the continued existence of the beach mice before theycan provide the funds or issue the permits to the private landowner. However,the Service is not aware of any cases at the present time where activitiesof private landowners would be affected by this requirement. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allendangered and threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, wouldmake it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates to take, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the courseof commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreigncommerce listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally.Certain exceptions would apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered and threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances.Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23 and 17.32. Suchpermits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagationor survival of the species, and/or incidental take in connection with otherwiselawful activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. In some instances, permits may be issued during aspecified period of time to relieve undue economic hardship that wouldbe suffered if such relief were not available. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environment Policy Act of1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Bangs, O. 1898.
