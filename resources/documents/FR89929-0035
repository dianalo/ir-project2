This freshwater mussel historically occurred in the OhioRiver and its large tributaries in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Presently, the ring pink musselis known from four relic, apparently nonreproducing, populations in theStates of Kentucky and Tennessee. The distribution and reproductive capacityof this species has been seriously impacted by the construction of impoundmentson the large rivers it once inhabited.

This freshwater species, which is characterized as a large-riverspecies (Bates and Dennis 1985), has a medium to large shell that is ovateto subquadrate in outline (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). The shell exteriorlacks rays and has a yellow-green to brown color. Older individuals areusually darker brown or black. The inside of the shell is salmon to deeppurple surrounded by a white border. Like other freshwater mussels, itfeeds by filtering food particles from the water. It has a complete reproductivecycle in which the mussel's larvae parasitize fish. The mussel's life span,fish species its larvae parasitize, and other aspects of its life historyare unknown.The ring pink mussel was historically widely distributed in the Ohio, Cumberland,and Tennessee River systems in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, KentuckyNature Preserves Commission 1980, Parmalee and Klippel 1982, Lauritsen1987, Stansbery 1970). Based on personal communications with knowledgeableexperts (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson, Tennessee Valley Authority,1987; Arthur Bogan, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, 1988; Arthur Clarke,Corpus Christi State University, 1986; Ronald Cicerello, Kentucky NaturePreserves Commission, 1988; James Sickel, Murray State University, 1987;and David Stansbery, Ohio State University, 1987) and a review of currentliterature (see above plus Sickel 1985), the species is known to survivein only four river reaches. The species still exists but apparently doesnot reproduce in the Tennessee River, Livingston, Marshall, and McCrackenCounties, Kentucky; the Tennessee River in Hardin County, Tennessee; theCumberland River, Wilson, Trousdale, and Smith Counties, Tennessee; andthe Green River, Hart and Edmonson Counties, Kentucky.The continued existence of these four populations is questionable. Unlessreproducing populations can be found or methods can be developed to maintainthese or create new populations, the species will become extinct in theforeseeable future. The individuals that still survive in these four riverreaches are also threatened from other factors. The Green River in Kentuckyhas experienced water quality problems related to the impacts from oiland gas production in the watershed. The individuals still surviving inthe Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers are potentially threatened by graveldredging, channel maintenance, and commercial mussel fishing. Althoughthe species is not commercially valuable, incidental take of the speciesdoes sometimes occur during commercial mussel fishing for other species.The ring pink mussel was recognized by the Service in the May 22, 1984,<T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 21664) and the January 6, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 554) as a species that was being consideredfor possible addition to the Federal List of Endangered and ThreatenedWildlife and Plants. On March 17, 1987, and October 27, 1987, the Servicenotified Federal, State, and local governmental agencies and interestedindividuals by mail that a status review was being conducted specificallyon this mussel and that the species could be proposed for listing. Sincethat time, additional contacts with Federal and State agency personneland the scientific community have occurred concerning the species' statusand its potential for being protected under the Act.On March 7, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 9529) a proposal to list the golf stickpearly mussel, now referred to as the ring pink mussel, as an endangeredspecies. That proposal provided information on the species' biology andstatus and threats to its continued existence. The proposal also solicitedcomments on the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the March 7, 1989, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interestedparties were requested to submit factual reports and information that mightcontribute to development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and Stateagencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and interestedparties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice was publishedin the following newspapers: <T3>Hart County News, </T3>Munfordville, Kentucky, March 23, 1989; <T3>Lebanon Democrat, </T3>Lebanon, Tennessee, March 24, 1989; <T3>Paducah Sun, </T3>Paducah, Kentucky, March 26, 1989; and <T3>Savannah Courier, </T3>Savannah, Tennessee, April 6, 1989.Support for listing the ring pink mussel as an endangered species was receivedfrom the Tennessee Valley Authority, National Park Service, Kentucky Departmentof Fish and Wildlife Resources, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, OhioDepartment of Natural Resources, and one private individual. The U.S. SoilConservation Service, Nashville, Tennessee, stated that they had ``* ** no current of planned activities that would likely jeopardize the continuedexistence of the species.'' Three respondents suggested that the ring pinkmussel is a more accepted common name for the species. The Service hasmade that name change in the final rule.The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources stated thatthe proposed rule does not support listing because, as the fish host isunknown and none of the presently known populations are reproducing, Federalprotection could not save the species. The Service agrees that these problemsplus other considerations make it doubtful that this species can ever berecovered. However, the Service references section 4 (a)(1) and (b) ofthe Act, which requires the Secretary of Interior to determine whethera species is an endangered or threatened species based solely on one ormore of five specific factors. These five factors and their applicationto the ring pink mussel are presented in the ``Summary of Factors Affectingthe Species'' section of this rule. Neither incomplete life history information,lack of reproducing populations, nor the relative likelihood of recoveryis pertinent to any of the five factors considered in determining a species'Federal status.The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources also statedthat it is not reasonable to list a species that does not have a recoveryplan. The Service responds that recovery plans, in accordance with section4(f) of the Act, are developed subsequent to a species being listed. This,listing is a precursor to and facilitates the development and implementationof recovery plans.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information, the Servicehas determined that the ring pink mussel should be classified as an endangeredspecies. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered SpeciesAct (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the ring pinkmussel (<T3>Obovaria retusa</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The ring pink mussel was once widespreadin the Ohio River and its large tributaries in Pennsylvania, West Virginia,Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee1983). However, most of the historically known populations were apparentlylost due to conversion of many sections of these big rivers to a seriesof large impoundments. This seriously reduced the availability of preferredriverine gravel/and habitat, and it likely affects the distribution andavailability of the mussel's fish host. As a result, the species' distributionhas been substantially reduced.The species was last taken in Pennsylvania in 1908 (Daniel Devlin, PennsylvaniaDepartment of Environmental Resources, personal communication, 1987). Nolive or fresh-dead specimens have been taken in West Virginia in recentyears (William Tolin, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication,1987). According to a personal communication with Robert McCance, Jr. (OhioDepartment of Natural Resources, 1987), the last Ohio collection of thering pink mussel was made in 1938. In Indiana waters, the species has notbeen collected in decades (Max Henschen, Indiana Mollusk Technical AdvisoryCommittee, personal communication, 1987). The Illinois Department of Energyand Natural Resources (Kevin Cummings, personal communication, 1987) reportedthat the species has not been collected from Illinois in over 30 years.The species is presently known from only four river reaches_two in Kentuckyand two in Tennessee. In Kentucky waters, the ring pink mussel has beentaken in recent years only from the Tennessee River in McCracken, Livingston,and Marshall Counties, and from the Green River in Hart and Edmonson Counties(Linda Andrews, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, andRonald Cicerello, personal communication, 1987). Kentucky's Tennessee Riverpopulation is represented by the collection of only two live individualsin recent years. One was taken in 1985 (Sickel 1985), and the other wascollected in 1986 (C.E. Moore, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, personal communication,1987). In the Green River, only one fresh-dead individual was taken duringa mussel survey between Munfordville, Kentucky, and Mammoth Cave, Kentucky,in 1987 (Ronald Cicerello, personal communication, 1987). The last livespecimen taken from the Green River was collected in the mid-1960s (MaryHeller, Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet,personal communication, 1987).In Tennessee the species apparently still survives in the Cumberland Riverin Wilson, Trousdale, and Smith Counties, and in the Tennessee River inHardin County. According to personal communications with knowledgeableindividuals, the species is taken on rare occasions by commercial musselfishermen from both these rivers (Paul Parmalee, University of Tennessee,personal communication, 1986; Steven Ahlstedt, personal communication,1987; Paul Yokley, University of North Alabama, personal communication,1987).The four surviving populations are all threatened for impacts to theirenvironment. The Green River population is threatened from degradationof water quality resulting from inadequate environmental controls at oiland gas exploration and production facilities, and from altered streamflows from an upstream reservoir. The other populations are potentiallythreatened by river channel maintenance, navigation projects, and graveland sand dredging.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> Although the species is not commercially valuable, it doesexist in harvested mussel beds, and the species is therefore sometimestaken by mussel fishermen. Thus, take does pose some threat to the species.Federal protection will help to control the take of individuals.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Although the ring pink mussel is undoubtedlyconsumed by predatory animals, there is no evidence that predation threatensthe species. However, freshwater mussel die-offs have recently (early tomid-1980s) been reported throughout the Mississippi River basin, includingthe Tennessee River and its tributaries (Richard Neves, Virginia PolytechnicInstitute and State University, personal communication, 1986). The causeof the die-offs has not been determined, but significant losses have occurredto some populations. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The States ofKentucky and Tennessee prohibit taking fish and wildlife, including freshwatermussels, for scientific purposes without a State collecting permit. However,these States do not protect the species from take for other purposes. Federallisting will provide the species additional protection under the EndangeredSpecies Act by requiring Federal permits to take the species and by requiringFederal agencies to consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize,or carry out may affect the species. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>None of the four populations is known to be reproducing. Therefore,unless reproducing populations can be found or methods can be developedto maintain these or create new populations, the species will be lost inthe foreseeable future. In fact, three of the populations (Cumberland andTennessee River populations) may contain only old individuals that havepassed their reproductive age. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the ring pink mussel (<T3>Obovaria retusa</T3>) as an endangered species. Historical recordsreveal that the species was once much more widely distributed in many ofthe large rivers of the Ohio River system. Presently only four isolated,apparently non-reproducing, populations are known to survive. Due to thespecies' history of population losses and the vulnerability of the fourremaining populations, threatened status does not appear appropriate forthis species (see ``Critical Habitat'' section for a discussion of whycritical habitat is not being designated for the ring pink mussel). <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timea species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service findsthat designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for the ringpink mussel owing to the lack of benefits from such designation. The U.S.Army Corps of Engineers, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the NationalPark Service are the three Federal agencies most involved, and they, alongwith the State natural resources agencies in Tennessee and Kentucky, arealready aware of the location of the remaining populations that would beaffected by any activities in these river reaches. These Federal agencieshave conducted studies in these river basins and are knowledgeable of thefauna and of impacts that could result from their projects. No additionalbenefits would accrue from critical habitat designation that would notalso accrue from the listing of the species. In addition, this speciesis so rare that taking for scientific purposes or private collections couldbe a threat. The publication of critical habitat maps and other informationaccompanying critical habitat designation, such as the location of inhabitedriver reaches, could increase that threat. The location of populationsof this species has consequently been described only in general terms inthis final rule. More precise locality data is available to appropriateFederal, State, and local governmental agencies through the Service officedescribed in the <T2>``ADDRESSES''</T2> section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Servicehas notified Federal agencies that may have programs that affect the species.Federal activities that could occur and impact the species include, butare not limited to, the carrying out or the issuance of permits for hydroelectricfacility construction and operation, reservoir construction, river channelmaintenance, stream alteration, wastewater facilities development, androad and bridge construction. It has been the experience of the Service,however, that nearly all Section 7 consultations have been resolved sothat the species has been protected and the project objectives have beenmet. In fact, the areas inhabited by the ring pink mussel are also inhabitedby other mussels that have been federally listed since 1976. The Servicehas a history of successful section 7 conflict resolutions. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell oroffer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. Italso is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship anysuch wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply toagents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or forincidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Bates, J.M., and S.D.
