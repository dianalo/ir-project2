Measured in 1985 dollars, it required an income of $48,000 to be included in the top 20% in 1985, compared with only $37,152 in 1980. A household earning $37,152 in 1980 could have had a huge 28% increase in real income by 1985, and yet &quot;fallen&quot; from the top 20% to the second 20% of the income distribution. Such a family obviously would be much better off, yet slicing the nation's income into fifths would make it appear that the middle class is, as Lester Thurow put it, having &quot;trouble holding its own.&quot;    Since only incomes above $48,000 were included in the top 20% in 1985, there were obviously more dollars in that category than in 1980, when it also included incomes of $37,152 to $47,999, but that has no significance whatsoever. The fact that the top 20% earns a bit more than 40% of all income in every advanced country, including Sweden, simply means that a highly educated fifth of the population produces twice as much as average, and the top fifth of households have more than two family members working while the bottom fifth has less than one.    Alan Reynolds   Vice President, Polyconomics Inc.    Morristown, N.J.    ---   The Outlook column featured a Census Bureau table on income distribution and the views of Joseph Minarik of the Urban Institute regarding that distribution. The lasting impression is that, once again, the rich have improved their lot at the expense of the poor. This issue deserves another airing.    Mr. Minarik wants you to believe that the lowest quintile of families somehow was denied $22.5 billion because its share of money income fell by one percentage point. His arithmetic betrays his faulty logic. That figure does represent 1% of money income in 1986 (about $2.25 trillion), but it has no relevance whatever to income trends over time.    The time period of the table is 1969-86. During that time, the share of income of the lowest quintile did drop by one percentage point, as Mr. Minarik states; however, aggregate family money income grew at an impressive inflation-adjusted 38%. Mr. Minarik's assertion does not take that into account. Given the fact that most policy analysts admit the consumer price index has overstated inflation, increases in living standards are even higher than real money income growth portrays.    Concentrating on income distribution may appeal to egalitarian sentiments, but it is completely misleading when income growth is not part of the analysis. Mr. Minarik also appears to blame the current administration for the situation -- since the year he uses is 1986 -- when in fact nearly all the erosion in income shares occurred between 1974 and 1982. Since then, economic growth and opportunity have clearly elevated living standards of lower-income families. And the prospects for continued success are even brighter, given the current performance of the U.S. economy.    Dale Jahr   Economist, Congressional Joint Economic Committee   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
