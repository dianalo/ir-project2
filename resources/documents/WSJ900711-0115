The diamonds, which GE hopes to begin producing incommerical quantities in the next year or two, will be cutinto thin slices and sold for use in electronic components,lasers and communications equipment.</LP><TEXT>   The GE diamonds are superior to natural diamonds in theirability to soak up heat, the company's scientists said. Thus,slices of the diamonds can be used to dissipate heat producedin lasers and microelectronic circuits. GE officialsestimated the market for such heat-absorbing diamonds at $50million to $100 million a year.   The GE diamonds are larger than the half-carat,gem-quality synthetic diamonds that Sumitomo ElectricIndustries of Japan has been selling to electronics companiesfor the last five years. The GE stones, however, aren't aslarge as gem-quality synthetic diamonds producedexperimentally by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the bigSouth African diamond cartel. In 1987, the GemologicalInstitute of America reported it had examined a five-caratsynthetic diamond loaned to the institute by De Beers.   GE scientists said their diamonds were superior to otherdiamonds for heat-transfer properties. Diamonds are crystalsof pure carbon, with 99% of the carbon being the isotopecarbon-12. In natural diamonds, the scientists explained, theheat-transfer properties are limited by the presence of thecarbon-13 isotope, which comprises 1% or more of naturaldiamonds.   The GE diamonds are more than 99.9% pure carbon-12, saidthe scientists from the company's research and developmentlaboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., where the methods for makingthe diamonds were developed.   Tests by scientists at Wayne State University in Detroitfound that the &quot;isotopically pure&quot; synthetic diamonds are farbetter heat sinks than predicted, the company said. Thesynthetic diamonds, for instance, are 1,000% more resistantto damage from high-powered laser beams than naturaldiamonds.   GE said its scientists developed a twostep process formaking the isotopically pure diamonds. In the first step, achemical vapor rich in carbon-12 is deposited on a slab underlow pressure to create tiny diamond crystals. The sheet ofcrystals is then crushed into a powder that is placed in alarge press that generates tremendously high pressures andtemperatures. A &quot;seed&quot; diamond crystal and a metal catalystis added. Careful control of pressures and temperaturesforces carbon-12 atoms to migrate to the seed crystal andbuild up a large, gem-quality diamond.</TEXT></DOC>
