Keating and 23 family members and associates were dismissedThursday from their managerial positions at the Phoenician andLincoln's other upscale property, the Cresent Hotel in Phoenix.They were replaced by managers hired by federal regulators.   Regulators, accompanied by FBI agents, Phoenix police officersand private security guards, seized the properties at 1:30 a.m.,according to Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the Resolution TrustCorp., the federal agency created this summer to handle failed Sandamp;Ls.   Few of the guests staying at the 605-room Phoenician seemedparticularly aware of the change in management. Life went on at theresort's sprawling golf, tennis and golf complex carved from thebase of a mountain overlooking Phoenix and Scottsdale.   A.J. Stoll of Oregon, who was vacationing with his wife, Sally,said he had noticed new faces and was aware of the RTC-forcedchange in management.   ``We see them all over with their walkie-talkies _ the feds. Thepeople who work here all smile at you. The feds don't smile,'' hesaid.   Jayne Glenn, who lives in one of the Phoenician cottages, saidthe new management could only be an improvement.   ``It's not run very good,'' she said. ``The food is bad and theservice is bad. They just can't get their act together.''   ``We've not heard a thing and we've been here all day,'' saidPaul Hertz of Miami, as television news helicopters buzzed over theresort and camera crews roamed the marbled lobby.   Room rates at the Phoenician, featured by Robin Leach on histelevision special ``The Rich and Famous, 1989 World's Best,''range from $200 to $3,750 a night.   Travel agents were unsure what effect the action would have onreservations at the palatial Phoenician, which paid $25 million fororiginal art to hang in its hallways and ordered more Steinwaypianos at one time _ eight, for a total of over $350,000 _ than anyprivate company in history.   ``I think we would have to kind of study what the impact isgoing to be before we would advise our customers,'' said RobWunsch, a travel agent with the American Express Travel Service inDenver.   An agent for Ask Mr. Foster Travel in Denver, who refused togive her name, said her office had been told a week ago not to bookcustomers at the 344-room Crescent, which targets businessclientele.   One person who will be discouraged from returning to thePheonician is Keating himself, who used to have an office there,regulators said.   A spokesman for Keating denounced the seizure as ``the mostdespicable, outrageous, blatant act of terror we have ever seen byour U.S. government.''   ``The Gestapo-like tactics used on employees and management ofthe resort are just unconscionable,'' added Bradley Boland, seniorvice president of Lincoln's parent company, American ContinentalCorp. of Phoenix, and Keating's son-in-law.   Keating's continuation as manager of the Phoenician had galledmembers of the House Banking Committee, which is investigating thecollapse of the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift. The debacle isexpected to be the nation's largest savings and loan failure,costing taxpayers an estimated $2 billion.   Although Keating drew no salary as manager of the Phoenician, hecontinues to receive $400,000 a year as chairman of AmericanContinental. He is scheduled to testify before the House bankingpanel Tuesday.   American Continental filed for federal bankruptcy protectionApril 13, and federal regulators seized Lincoln and itssubsidiaries, including The Phoenician, the next day.   They later filed a $1.1 billion lawsuit against Keating and hisassociates alleging fraud and racketeering.   However, they could not dismiss Keating until they obtained theapproval of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, which has a 45 percentinterest in the resort and the right to block management changes,Whitney said. The office, based in London, makes real estateinvestments on behalf of the Kuwaiti government, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
