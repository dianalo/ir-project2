With 100 percent of the vote counted, government spokesmanMiguel Gil said early Monday the Socialists had won 39.55 percentof the vote for 176 seats in the 350-seat Cortes, the lower houseof Parliament.   The results allotted the following percentage of votes andnumber of Cortes seats for the other leading parties: theconservative Popular Party, 25.83 percent, 106; the CatalanConvergence and Union, 5 percent, 18; the United Left coalition, 9percent, 17; the Democratic and Social Center, 8 percent, 14. Theremaining 25 seats were divided among eight smaller parties.   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez told supporters in Madrid the``logical consequence of the outcome so far is that we will have tocontinue to assume the responsibility of governing.''   His wife, Carmen, was elected as a Socialist deputy from theprovince of Cadiz, making her the first spouse of a European headof government to sit in parliament along with a spouse. Gonzalezwas elected in Madrid.   Javier Arzallus, head of the conservative Basque NationalistParty, said earlier his party would offer its votes to Gonzalez toensure his re-election as prime minister when Parliament meets Nov.21.   Despite their victory, the Socialists did suffer a setback. Theyhad won 184 seats in the lower house in 1986 elections, down fromtheir landslide of 202 seats in 1982.   The Popular Party gained one seat and the United Left gained six.   Initial projections had indicated the Socialists wouldconfortably win their third straight parliamentary majority, butthose were revised after the polls closed at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EST).   The private radio newsork SER said polls of voters who castballots in the final two hours indicated an increase in votes forcentrist and rightist parties.   Gil said about 70 percent of Spain's 29.5 million registeredvoters cast ballots, with a heavy turnout in the final hours.   Analysts attributed the drop in Socialist support to discontentin the party's left wing with what is viewed as the pro-businessposition of Gonzalez's government.   Four parties and political coalitions ran candidates nationwideto elect 350 members to the Cortes and 208 senators, while a halfdozen regional parties entered some races.   In the 208-seat Senate, the Socialists won 109 seats, thePopular Party 74, the Convergence and Union 10, the United Left 1and the Democratic and Social Center 3. The remaining 11 seats wentto the smaller parties.   No single issue dominated this year's campaign.   Gonzalez defended his government's seven years in power as aperiod of stability and economic progress. But opposition forcesblasted him for the country's 16 percent unemployment rate,Europe's highest, and deteriorating public services.   The Popular Party, under its new leader and prime ministerialcandidate Jose Maria Aznar, remained the leading opposition party.   Aznar took over the party two months before Gonzalez calledearly elections Sept. 1.   The United Left coalition, which includes the Communist Party,was expected to be the major recipient of votes from unions andworkers who claim the government has failed to distribute equitablythe new wealth created by a four-year economic boom.   For the last three years, Spain has boasted a 4.5 percent annualgrowth rate, Europe's highest.   Gonzalez argued a Socialist majority is necessary to assure agovernment strong enough to meet the challenges Spain faces as the12-nation European Economic Communisty advances toward the 1993integrated market.   The single market will increase competition by eliminatingbarriers among EEC nations on the movement of capital, labor, goodsand services.</TEXT></DOC>
