Consumers Union and the Natural Resources Defense Council,citing California's new corporate criminal liability law,warned top management at Dow Corning Corp. and three othercompanies that they could be held personally accountable --and can be imprisoned -- if they failed to disclose knownproduct hazards that can cause &quot;bodily harm.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In a letter to Dow Corning, the groups sought toestablish, among other things, when executives became awareof potential adverse effects of silicone implants.   The company, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. andCorning Inc., has been battered lately by news stories aboutinternal memos and other documents indicating that between1975 and 1985 the company put off safety studies and failedto warn surgeons and women of apparent health risks. The SanFrancisco Examiner was the first to report the contents ofsealed documents produced in a product-liability case againstDow Corning in San Francisco.   The letter was also sent to Bioplasty Inc., St. Paul,Minn., and to Mentor Corp., and McGhan Medical Corp., both ofSanta Barbara, Calif.   At the same time, the Bush administration came undergrowing political pressure to expedite a government decisionon whether silicone implants should remain on the market. OnJan. 6, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner DavidKessler called for a moratorium on the use of siliconeimplants, pending a review of new information, includingdocuments from the San Francisco case and from one pending inMichigan.   In a letter yesterday to Health and Human ServicesSecretary Louis Sullivan, Reps. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.)and Don Sundquist (R., Tenn.) urged the National Institutesof Health to assemble a blue-ribbon panel to rule on implantsafety. It would supplant an FDA advisory panel that Dr.Kessler plans to convene in mid-February.   The lawmakers argued that the FDA panel lacks theexpertise to evaluate case reports from rheumatologists thatindicate a possible link between silicone gel andimmune-system disorders in women.   They also criticized the FDA for not releasing the newevidence cited by Dr. Kessler. &quot;Women need this newinformation, and they need it now,&quot; said Rep. Torricelli.   Meanwhile, FDA officials, fed up with such criticism,blamed the delay on Dow Corning. They said the company has sofar refused to let the agency make public its confidentialpre-marketing application and to waive secrecy agreements inthe San Francisco and Michigan cases.   At the FDA's behest, the Justice Department has beensounding out Dan Bolton, the attorney who won a $7.3 millionjudgment against Dow Corning for a woman with rupturedimplants in the San Francisco case, about legal strategies toobtain the release of sealed corporate documents.   In Midland, Mich., Dow Corning spokeswoman BarbaraCarmichael complained about the FDA's &quot;lack of specificity&quot;in requesting the release of documents.   &quot;The FDA isn't in any predicament,&quot; she said. &quot;All theyhave to do is tell us what documents they want.&quot; But sheadded that the company doesn't plan to release any documents&quot;that don't deal with science.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
