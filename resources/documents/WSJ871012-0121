Calling attention to this serious problem hopefully will cause employers to more fully recognize their needs and responsibilities for training skilled workers. Until private-sector management implements and expands skilled training programs, such as is encouraged by the National Apprenticeship System, the problem will not be satisfactorily addressed.    When employers first suffer a decline in income and must begin considering cost-reduction measures, too often they make shortsighted management decisions to cut their training budgets. When the same employers first begin to recognize that business is improving and they may have a skilled-worker shortage, too often their first reaction is to &quot;pirate&quot; employees from competitors -- usually enticing them with higher wages. Such actions, of course, only fuel the flames of inflation and do nothing to provide more people with the needed job skills. In other words, too often employers' last thought is training.    To alleviate skilled-worker shortages in corporations with huge defense contracts, action should be taken to require such employers to allocate a certain percentage of their funds to formal skill-training programs. Likewise, there should be a requirement for the training of a specified number of skilled workers based upon a projection of the need for such workers in the next five- to 10-year period. Government contracts over a certain dollar level should mandate that employers calculate a turnover rate and future employment need for each skilled occupation and provide for formal structured training programs to meet those needs. Too often funds provided from government contract provisions requiring training are devoted to white-collar training, while what should be of primary concern is training to meet current and future skilled occupational needs.    At a time when we are faced with a major &quot;competitiveness&quot; issue and negative balance of trade concerns, we as a nation can no longer continue to be shortsighted with the training of our craftworkers. I also share the concerns of those executives referred to in the article who worry that our shortage of skilled workers adversely affects our ability to respond quickly to possible national emergency situations.    We must establish national priorities for accurately projecting skilled work force demands and for providing an expanded formal structured private-industry operated National Apprenticeship System. Management, labor and government must work together to ensure that our nation's human resources are fully utilized in an effective way to produce high-quality goods and services and to compete efficiently in today's global economy. We must provide the best possible training to meet our skilled-worker needs.    Thomas J. Hague   Director, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training    U.S. Department of Labor   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
