Shamir told Israel Radio there was ``no truth'' to the NBCtelevision news report, which said Israel has been engaged in apartnership with South Africa to develop nuclear missile capability.   ``We totally deny this story,'' said Shamir's media adviser, AviPazner. ``There is no nuclear link or cooperation between Israeland South Africa.''   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, said: ``I bear noknowledge whatsoever of such cooperation.''   In Washington, however, a U.S. official said today that SouthAfrica has test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile thatcould carry nuclear warheads and was built with help from Israel.   Israel and South Africa are also cooperating in development of along-range missile that can be used to launch reconnaissancesatellites into space, said the official, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The U.S. official said intelligence reports showed South Africahad tested a modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho IImedium-range missile at Armaston, on the Indian Ocean coast nearCapetown last summer.   Israel's Defense Ministry spokesman, Eitan Haber, said hiscountry is adhering to a March 18, 1987, Cabinet decision that nonew defense contracts between Israel and South Africa be signed.   NBC cited unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA documentin its report.   It said Israel provides missile technology to South Africa inreturn for a continuous supply of enriched uranium for its ownnuclear warheads and the use of the Overberg long-range test sitein South Africa.   The network said the Overberg site and a missile assemblybuilding there were built for both countries and that Israeliengineers have worked there for several years.   The first test resulting from the joint project took place July5 when a missile flew 900 miles southeast from the test site, NBCquoted the CIA paper as saying.   The document identified the South African state arms makerArmscor as the builder of the missile and said Israeli technologywas provided through Urdan Industries Ltd., based outside Tel Aviv,NBC reported.   Reached by telephone, a secretary at Urdan said the company'sdirector general, Yaacov Ben Bassat, was out of the country andcould not be reached for comment.   The British newspaper The Guardian published a report in Junethat South Africa was preparing to test a medium-range nuclearmissile developed in cooperation with Israel.   Trade and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon defended the principleof Israeli cooperation with South Africa, recalling South Africa'shelp when Israel was facing Arab-inspired boycotts.   ``But on this matter, we have a government decision and we areacting in accordance,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
