The assessment provides a basis for the conclusionthat the field testing of these genetically engineered cotton plants willnot present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest andwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> Dr. Sivramiah Shantharam, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 844, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-7612.

A permit must be obtainedbefore a regulated article can be introduced in the United States. Theregulations set forth procedures for obtaining a limited permit for theimportation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaininga permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article. TheAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it wouldprepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmentalimpact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environmentof a regulated article (see 53 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test cotton plants geneticallyengineered for tolerance to the herbicide Bromoxynil and to initiate crossesbetween genetically engineered plants and nontransformed cotton varietiesand lines.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the cotton plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the fieldtesting will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provided the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene for herbicide tolerance has been inserted into the cotton genome.In nature, genetic material contained in chromosome can only be transferredto other sexually compatible flowering plants by cross-pollination. Inthis field test, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollinationbecause the field test is at a sufficient distance away from any compatibleplants with which cotton plants may cross-pollinate. 2. Neither the herbicide tolerance gene by itself, nor its gene product,confer on cotton plants any plant pest characteristic. Traits that leadto weediness in plants are polygenic and cannot be conferred by addinga single herbicide tolerance gene.3. The micro-organism <T3>Klebstilla pneumoniae</T3> subsp. <T3>ozoanae</T3> from which the herbicide tolerance gene was isolated isnot a plant pest and is widely distributed in the environment as a commonsoil inhabitant.4. The herbicide tolerance gene does not provide the transformed cottonplants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed cottonplants in their ability to disseminate or to become established in theenvironment.5. The vector (tumor inducing Ti-plasmid) used to transfer the herbicidetolerance gene to cotton plants has been evaluated for its use in thisspecific experiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment.The vector, although derived from a DNA sequence of a known plant pest,has been effectively disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for producingplant disease have been removed from the vector. The vector has been testedand shown to be nonpathogenic to plants.6. The vector agent, <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens,</T3> the bacterium that was used to deliverthe vector DNA containing the herbicide tolerance gene into the plant cellis a well known plant pest, and has been effectively eliminated with anappropriate antibiotic and no longer associated with the transformed cottonplants.7. Generally, the horizontal movement of the introduced gene(s) is notpossible except by pollination of compatible flowering plants. In thiscase, the cotton plants are generally self-pollinators and therefore, donot cross-pollinate other cotton varieties or other plants. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome where it is inserted stablyinto the plant chromosomal DNA. The vector moiety does not survive in theplants as it cannot replicate in plant cellular background.8. Bromoxynil is a herbicide that rapidly degrades in the environment.It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than many herbicides commonlyused.9. The size of the field test is very small (238 feet and 4 inches wideby 378 feet long) and is biologically isolated from many species of wildplants and animals by a surrounding area of cultivated land.10. Being located on a private farm, the experimental plot has good physicalsecurity.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions on NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 14th day of July 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
