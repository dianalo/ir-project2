They may be obtained at the above address.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background  </ITAG>The Railroad Retirement Board administers two major programs: It pays retirementand disability benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. 231<T3>et seq.</T3>) and unemployment and sickness benefits under the RailroadUnemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 351 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The former replaces the social security system withrespect to employees in the railroad industry. The latter replaces variousstate unemployment compensation laws with respect to employees in the railroadindustry. The Board also administers or has administered a number of smallerbenefit programs with regard to displaced workers of various bankrupt railroads.The purpose of this rule is to provide for the enforcement of section 504of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as it appliesto programs and activities conducted by the Railroad Retirement Board.Section 504 states, in pertinent part, that:<ITAG tagnum="21">No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States,* * * shall, solely by reasons of his handicap, be excluded from the participationin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination underany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance <T3>or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agencyor by the United States Postal Service. The head of each such agency shallpromulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendmentsto this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulationshall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress,and such regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day afterthe date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(29 U.S.C. 794 (1978 amendment italicized).)</ITAG>On December 16, 1987, the Board published Part 365 as a proposed rule andinvited comments for 60 days ending February 16, 1988 (52 FR 47601-47610).The Board received one comment from the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Associationwhich pointed out that andSection; 365.103 provides that the regulationsdo not apply to federally assisted programs and consequently, that if theBoard administers any such programs, the Board should adopt regulationsapplying the subject matter of Part 365 to those programs. The Board doesnot administer any such programs; accordingly, no such regulations areneeded.  Section 504 requires that regulations that apply to the programs and activitiesof Federal Executive agencies shall be submitted to the appropriate authorizingcommittees of Congress and that such regulations may take effect no earlierthan the thirtieth day after they have been so submitted. The Board issubmitting this regulation to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resourcesand its Subcommittee on the Handicapped and to the House Committee on Educationand Labor and its Subcommittee on Select Education. This regulation willbecome effective on December 27, 1988.  The substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the agency, as set forthin this rule, are identical, for the most part, to those established byFederal regulations for programs or activities receiving Federal financialassistance. <T3>See</T3> 28 CFR Part 41 (section 504 coordination regulation for federallyassisted programs). This general parallelism is in accord with the intentexpressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate, includingits sponsor, Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government shouldhave the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financialassistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>id.</T3>; 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <T3>id.</T3> at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).There are, however, some language differences between this rule and theFederal Government's section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs.These changes are based on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), and the subsequent circuit court decisionsinterpreting <T3>Davis </T3>and section 504. <T3>See </T3><T3>Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F. 2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis, </T3>655 F. 2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (<T3>APTA</T3>); <T3>see also </T3><T3>Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee </T3>v. <T3>Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, </T3> 718 F. 2d 490 (1st Cir.1983).These language differences are also supported by the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985), where the Court held that the regulationsfor federally assisted programs did not require a recipient to modify itsdurational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital care forhandicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis </T3>decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>id.</T3> at 300, and explicitly noted that ``[t]he regulations implementingsection 504 (for federally assisted programs) are consistent with the viewthat <T3>reasonable</T3> adjustments in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access'' (<T3>id.</T3> at 301 n. 21) (emphasis added).Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this section 504 federallyconducted regulation consistent with the Federal Government's section 504federally assisted regulations as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Manyof these federally assisted regulations were issued prior to the judicialinterpretations of <T3>Davis</T3>, subsequent lower court cases interpreting <T3>Davis,</T3> and <T3>Alexander;</T3> therefore their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Of course, these federally assisted regulations must be interpretedto reflect the holdings of the Federal judiciary. Hence the agency believesthat there are no significant differences between this regulation for federallyconducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretation of section504 regulations for federally assisted programs.This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is anadaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice under ExecutiveOrder 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed toExecutive agencies.This regulation has also been reviewed by the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp.,p. 206).It is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 (46FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, therefore, a regulatory impactanalysis has not been prepared.This regulation does not impose any requirements for information collectionswithin the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Railroad Retirement Board is not an ``agency'' within the meaning ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act and, accordingly, the requirements of thatAct are not applicable to the Board.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 365.101 Purpose.Section 365.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to effectuatesection 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and DevelopmentalDisabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalServices.Section 365.102 Application.This regulation applies to all programs or activities conducted by theagency. Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is,in simple terms, anything a Federal agency does. Aside from employment,there are two major categories of federally conducted programs or activitiescovered by this regulation: Those involving general public contact as partof ongoing agency operations and those directly administered by the agencyfor program beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first categoryinclude communication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins,or interviews) and the public's use of the agency's facilities. Activitiesin the second category include programs that provide Federal services orbenefits. This regulation does not, however, apply to programs or activitiesconducted outside the United States that do not involve individuals withhandicaps in the United States.Section 365.103 Definitions.``Agency.'' For purposes of this regulation ``agency'' means the RailroadRetirement Board.``Assistant Attorney General.'' ``Assistant Attorney General'' refers tothe Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Departmentof Justice.``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enablepersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equalopportunity to participate in an enjoy the benefits of the agency's programsor activities. The definition provides examples of commonly used auxiliaryaids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by andSection;365.160(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirements.``Board'' Board means the three-member governing body of the agency. SeeandSection;andSection; 365.170(i) and 365.170(j), 45 U.S.C. 231f(a).``Chief Executive Officer.'' The Chief Executive Officer is the chief operatingofficer of the agency.``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include allthe information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the complaint.The definition is necessary because the 120 day period for the agency'sinvestigation (see andSection; 365.170(g)) begins when the agency receivesa complete complaint.``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs, 28CFR 41.3(f), except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added and the phrase ``or interest in such property'' has beendeleted to clarify its coverage. The phrase, ``or interest in such property,''is deleted because the term ``facility,'' as used in this regulation, refersto structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however,be noted that the regulation applies to all programs and activities conductedby the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they are conductedis owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the agency. The term ``facility''is used in andSection;andSection; 365.149, 365.150, and 365.170(f).``Individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``individual with handicaps''is identical to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearing in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin this regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.``Qualified individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' follows the definition of ``qualified handicappedperson'' with respect to services that appears in the section 504 coordinationregulation for federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32). Under this definition a qualified individual with handicaps is an individualwith handicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participationin, or receipt of benefits under a program or activity administered bythe Board. Paragraph (2) of this definition explains that ``qualified individual withhandicaps'' means ``qualified handicapped person'' as the term is definedfor purposes of employment in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission'sregulation at 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this partby andSection; 365.140. Nothing in this part changes existing regulationsapplicable to employment. ``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this regulation,``section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conducted by theagency and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federal financialassistance.Section 365.110 Self-evaluation. The agency shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evalutionrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504.Section 365.111 Notice. Section 365.111 requires the agency to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of the rights and protections afforded by section504 and this regulation. Methods of providing this information include,for example, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, andpamphlets that are distributed to the public to describe the agency's programsand activities; the display of informative posters in service centers andother public places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio.Section 365.130 General prohibitions against discrimination. Section 365.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51). Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection; 365.130 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates thismandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remainingsections of the regulation. If the agency violates a provision in any ofthe subsequent sections, it will also have violated one of the generalprohibitions found in andSection; 365.130. When there is no applicable subsequentprovision, the general prohibitions stated in this section apply. Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individualswith handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an individual withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from itsprograms simply because the person is handicapped. The agency must paybenefits under the entitlement programs it administers to any individualwho meets the statutory requirements for those programs. The agency maynot afford an individual with handicaps access to assistance in obtainingbenefits under any program which it administers that is not equal to theaccess afforded to others. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) requires that the opportunity to participate or benefitafforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective as that affordedto others. The later sections on program accessibility (andSection;andSection;365.149-365.151) and communications (andSection; 365.160) are specific applicationsof this principle. Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its programsand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needsof qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), in conjunctionwith paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop separate or differentaids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide individuals withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from theagency's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires that differentor separate aids, benefits, or services be provided only when necessaryto ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as effective as thoseprovided to others. Even when separate or different aids, benefits, orservices would be more effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualifiedindividual with handicaps still has the right to choose to participatein the program that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps.Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified individualwith handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planningor advisory board.Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from limiting a qualified individualwith handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, oropportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service.Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the agency'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written agency policies and the actual practices ofthe agency. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary policiesor practices and nonessential policies and practices that are neutral ontheir face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunityto take the necessary actions to obtain benefits under the programs administerdby the agency.Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;365.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the agency. Paragraph(b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existingsite.Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the agency, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statuteor Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicaps,or a given class of individuals with handicaps, may be limited to thoseindividuals with handicaps.Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the agency must administerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, <T3>i.e., </T3>in a setting that enables individuals with handicaps tointeract with nonhandicapped persons to the fullest extent possible.Section 365.140 Employment.Section 365.140 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in emplymentby the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, coversthe employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner </T3>v. <T3>Morris, </T3>752 F. 2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>742 F. 2d 257, 259-260 (6th Cir.1984); <T3>Prewitt </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>662 F. 2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir.1981). Contra <T3>McGuiness </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>744 F. 2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th Cir.1984); <T3>Boyd </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>752 F. 2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir.1985).Courts uniformly have held that in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Morgan </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service, </T3>798 F. 2d 1162, 1164-65 (8th Cir.1986), <T3>Smith, </T3>742 F. 2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt, </T3>662 F. 2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 365.140 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR Part 1613. In addition to this section, andSection; 365.17(b)specifies that the agency will use the existing EEOC procedures to resolveallegations of employment discrimination.Responsibility for coordinating enforcement of Federal Laws prohibitingdiscrimination in employment is assigned to the EEOC by Excutive Order12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under this authority, the EEOC establishesgovernment-wide standards on nondiscrimination in employment on the basisof handicap. While this rule could define terms with respect to employmentand enumerate what practices are covered and what requirements apply, theagency has adopted EEOC's recommendation that to avoid duplicative, competing,or conflicting standards with respect to Federal employment, referencein these regulations to the government-wide EEOC rules is sufficient. Theclass of Federal employees and applicants for employment covered by section504 is identical to or subsumed within that covered by section 501. Toapply different or lesser standards to persons alleging violations of section504 could lead unnecessarily to confusion in the enforcement of the RehabilitationAct with respect to Federal employment.Section 365.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.Section 365.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 365.150 and365.151.Section 365.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.This regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existingsection 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 365.150 requires that the services and assistance whichthe agency provides to those individuals seeking benefits under programsadministered by the agency, when viewed in their entirety, be readily accessibleto and usable by individuals with handicaps.Although all facilities, except for the Board's headquarters building inChicago, in which the agency operates are either owned or leased by andunder the control of the General Services Administration (GSA), the agencyrecognizes its obligation to request the GSA to make any structural changeswhich the agency determines are necessary to ensure program accessibility.The regulation also makes clear that the agency is not required to makeeach of its existing facilities accessible (andSection; 365.150(a)(1)). However,andSection; 365.150, unlike 28 CFR 41.56-41.57, places explicit limits onthe agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility (andSection; 365.150(a)(2)).Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the scopeof the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement the agencyis not required to take, or request the GSA to take, any action that wouldresult in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activityor in undue financial and administrative burdens. A similar limitationis provided in andSection; 365.160(c). This provision is based on the SupremeCourt's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not requireprogram modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the natureof a program, and on the Court's statement that section 504 does not requiremodifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F. 2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis (APTA), </T3>655 F. 2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). This interpretationis also supported by the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementing regulation (<T3>id. </T3>at 299).Relying on <T3>Davis, </T3>the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicappedpersons ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers'' (<T3>id. </T3>at 301) and that ``<T3>reasonable adjustments </T3>in the nature of the benefit being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' (<T3>id., </T3>n. 21) (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute `fundamental alteration(s)in the nature of a program' '' (<T3>id., </T3>n. 20) (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander </T3>supports the position, based on <T3>Davis </T3>and the earlier lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency'sprogram or activity or entail such extensive costs and administrative burdensthat the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory.Thus the failure to include such an ``undue burden'' provision could leadto judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particularenforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it doesnot relieve the agency of all obligations to individuals with handicaps.Although the agency is not required to take or request the GSA to takeactions that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature ofa program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens,it nevertheless must take or request the GSA to take any other steps necessaryto ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and servicesof the federally conducted program or activity.It is our view that compliance with andSection; 365.150(a) would in mostcases not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the agency.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation ofthe conducted program or activity should be considered. The burden of provingthat compliance with andSection; 365.150(a) would fundamentally alter thenature of a program or activity or would result in undue financial andadministrative burdens rests with the agency. The decision that compliancewould result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief ExecutiveOfficer and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons forreaching that conclusion. Any person who believes that he or she or anyspecific class of persons has been injured by the Chief Executive Officer'sdecision or failure to make a decision may file an appeal under the complianceprocedures established in andSection; 365.170(h).Paragraph (b) indicates that in general the agency will comply with therequirements of andSection; 365.150 by making home visits. Paragraph (b)also sets forth a number of other means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods,the agency shall give priority consideration to those that will be consistentwith provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriate tothe needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existingfacilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to makethe agency's program accessible. (It should be noted that ``structuralchanges'' include all physical changes to a facility; the term does notrefer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or alterationto a load-bearing structural member). The agency may comply with the programaccessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessiblesites.Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make or, where applicable,request the GSA to make, any necessary structural changes in facilitiesas soon as practicable, but in no event later than three years after theeffective date of this regulation. Where structural modifications are required,the agency will develop or, where applicable, request the GSA to developa transition plan within six months of the effective date of this regulation.Aside from structural changes, all other necessary steps to achieve complianceshall be taken within sixty days.Section 365.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterationsOverlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction under section504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157).Section 365.151 provides that those buildings that are constructed or alteredby, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed,or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicapsin accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgatedpursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C.4151-4157). We believe that it is appropriate to adopt the existing ArchitecturalBarriers Act standard for section 504 compliance because new and alteredbuildings subject to this regulation are also subject to the ArchitecturalBarriers Act and because adoption of the standard will avoid duplicativeand possibly inconsistent standards.Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of thisregulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility standardssimply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, to the programaccessibility standard for existing facilities in andSection; 365.150. Tothe extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered, they must alsomeet the new construction and alteration requirements of andSection; 365.151.Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildingsas subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlikethe construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoidedat little or no cost, the application of new construction standards toan existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofittingbuildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the agency believesthe same program accessibility standard should apply to both owned andleased existing buildings.In <T3>Rose</T3> v. <T3>United States Postal Service,</T3> 774 F. 2d 1355 (9th Cir. 1985),the Ninth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibilityat the time of lease. The <T3>Rose</T3> court did not address the issue of whether section 504 likewiserequires accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remandedto the District Court for, among other things, consideration of that issue.The agency may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirementsfor leased buildings after the litigation is completed.Section 365.160 CommunicationsSection 365.160 requires the agency to take appropriate steps to ensureeffective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants,participants, and members of the public. These steps shall include proceduresfor determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection; 365.160(a)(1)to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or activity. They shallalso include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request theauxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be given primaryconsideration by the agency (andSection; 365.160(a)(1)(i)). The agency shallhonor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective meansof communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be requiredunder andSection; 365.160(c). That paragraph limits the obligation of theagency to ensure effective communication in accordance with <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see, supra,</T3> preamble andSection; 365.150(a)(2)). Unless not requiredby andSection; 365.160(c), the agency shall provide auxiliary aids at nocost to the individual with handicaps.It is our view that compliance with andSection; 365.160 would, in most cases,not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the agency.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation ofthe conducted program or activity should be considered. The burden of provingthat compliance with andSection; 365.160 would fundamentally alter the natureof a program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrativeburdens rests with the agency. The decision that compliance would resultin such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief Executive Officerand must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reachingthat conclusion. Any person who believes that he or she or any specificclass of persons has been injured by the Chief Executive Officer's decisionor failure to make a decision may file an appeal under the compliance proceduresestablished in andSection; 365.170(h).In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be sufficientto permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired person. In manycircumstances, however, they may not be, particularly when the informationbeing communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthy period of time(<T3>e.g.,</T3> a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participantis not skilled in spoken or written language. Then, a sign language interpretermay be appropriate. For vision-impaired persons, effective communicationmight be achieved by several means, including readers and audio recordings.In general, the agency intends to make clear to the public (1) the communicationsservices it offers to afford individuals with handicaps an equal opportunityto participate in or benefit from its programs or activities, (2) the opportunityto request a particular mode of communication, and (3) the agency's preferencesregarding auxiliary aids if it can demonstrate that several different modesare effective.The agency shall ensure effective communication with vision-impaired andhearing-impaired persons involved in hearings conducted by the agency.Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communicationat the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the agencymay require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedingof the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the agency need not provide individuallyprescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devicesof a personal nature (andSection; 365.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agencyneed not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicants or participantsin its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not require the agencyto provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.Paragraph (b) requires the agency to take appropriate steps to provideinformation to individuals with handicaps concerning accessible services,activities, and facilities and to ensure that information regarding section504 rigths and protections that is supplied to employees, applicants, participants,beneficiaries, and other interested persons under andSection; 365.111 iseffectively communicated to individuals with handicaps.Section 365.170 Compliance procedures.Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (l) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the agency will process employmentcomplaints according to procedures established in existing regulationsof the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).The agency is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints(andSection; 365.170(d)). If it determines that it does not have jurisdictionover a complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonableefforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the Federalgovernment (andSection; 365.170(e)). Paragraph (f) requires the agency to notify the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a facilitysubject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed, oraltered in a manner that does not provide ready access to and use by individualswith handicaps. Paragraph (g) requires the agency to provide to the complainant, in writing,findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if noncomplianceis found, and notice of the right to appeal (andSection; 365.170(g)). Oneappeal within the agency shall be provided (andSection; 365.170(i)). Theappeal will not be heard by the same person who made the initial determinationof compliance or noncompliance (andSection; 365.170(i)). Paragraph (l) permits the agency to delegate its authority for investigatingcomplaints to other Federal agencies. Under this paragraph the agency mayhave any required investigation performed by a non-government investigatorunder contract with the agency. However, the statutory obligation of theagency to make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance maynot be delegated. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 365</ITAG>Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Employment, Equal employment opportunity,Federal Buildings and facilities, Government employees, Handicapped.
