The disagreement underscores a split between the U.S. andIsraeli governments over Palestinian unrest that has claimed morethan 200 lives in the last eight months.   The latest U.S. complaint was registered unannounced Monday,when Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead summoned OdedEran, the deputy Israeli ambassador, to his office.   On several occasions, the State Department has also taken thepublic offensive against Israel on the issue by authorizingspokesmen to criticize the expulsion of Palestinians as unjustified.   The U.S. position is that if individuals are accused of illegalacts they should be charged and prosecuted, not summarily bannedfrom the territory that Israel has held since 1967.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley declined Tuesday toprovide any details about Whitehead's meeting with Eran, who is incharge of the Israeli embassy while Ambassador Moshe Arad is onhome leave.   It was learned, however, that Whitehead, who is filling in forthe vacationing Secretary of State George P. Shultz, told Erad theU.S. government was unhappy with the expulsions.   Yossi Gal, the Israeli embassy spokesman, declined to describethe session. However, he said that in trying to cope with violenceon the West Bank and in Gaza, the Israeli government usesexpulsions ``only as a last resort.''   Gal said the expulsions are carried out ``in conformity with thelaw of the land and subject to review of the Israeli high court.''   ``It is done as a measure of last resort in order to try toensure public safety and is used only when we are convinced it isthe best way to handle the instigators and the inciters in theterritories,'' the spokesman added.</TEXT></DOC>
