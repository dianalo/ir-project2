There, a skywriter spelled out &quot;Blue Hill Plaza&quot; -- the name of a new office complex in Rockland County, N.Y., 20 minutes north of Manhattan.    &quot;We can't afford to leave any stone unturned,&quot; says Edward S. Gordon, a New York real-estate broker who thought up the scheme for the project's developer. &quot;People used to wait for the customer to knock on the door. Now you have to create an awareness that will lure customers in.&quot;    Because of a glut of commercial and residential real estate in many parts of the U.S., developers and property owners are hustling harder than ever to stir up interest in their buildings. They are turning to radio and television advertising -- not to mention less conventional methods -- to reach potential customers. They are also spending more time and money -- from elaborate galas to rich incentives -- courting the brokers who bring tenants to their properties.    &quot;With more product available, people have to work harder for the buyers,&quot; says Adrienne Albert, president of Marketing Directors Inc., a New York-based real-estate marketing concern. &quot;Developers are earmarking far more money from their budgets for advertising and marketing than ever before.&quot;    And more developers are using television. &quot;There are so many newspaper ads out there today that you want to set yourself apart,&quot; says Martin J. Raynes, president of M.J. Raynes Inc. His company, a large owner of residential real estate in the New York area, recently used 10-second television spots to pitch apartments. Mr. Raynes, and many other residential real-estate developers across the country, believe consumers thinking of moving are more likely to remember television ads than magazine and newspaper ads.    Other developers say they like the reach of radio and television. Northshore Towers, a condominium development in Queens, N.Y., ran a major radio and television ad campaign this fall. Sherman Boxer, president of Equity Advertising Agency Inc., which did the ads, says, &quot;We reached a much broader audience than we could have reached in a real-estate advertising section.&quot; He claims the ads drew some people to look at the apartments who hadn't been thinking of moving.    Tishman-Speyer Properties Inc., a New York-based developer, recently hired David Garth, the media consultant best known for his political work, to make a 30-second television ad for a downtown Manhattan office tower it is building. &quot;We're selling a product, just like somebody who makes widgets sells a product,&quot; says Geoffrey Wharton, a Tishman-Speyer partner. &quot;By using TV, we're hoping to create an awareness.    But some people in the business express doubts that television and radio are effective ways to advertise real estate. Allan Rosenberg, president of Dallas-based Rosenberg andamp; Co., which specializes in real-estate advertising, warns, &quot;There's a great deal of waste circulation -- people who aren't in the market for real estate.&quot;    With commercial properties, for instance, usually just a handful of people decide where a company or business will locate. &quot;TV is a shotgun approach,&quot; says Richard Stein, a Chicago real-estate developer who last year used television to advertise an office and retail complex.    Gerald D. Hines, a Houston-based commercial developer, shuns advertising altogether -- no matter where it is. But because many of the markets in which he owns properties are soft, his company, too, is marketing its real estate more aggressively than ever -- albeit in its own low-key way. The concern, Gerald D. Hines Interests, recently opened marketing centers in Minneapolis and Boston. There, prospective tenants are shown detailed models of buildings under construction and architects' sketches tracing the evolution of the projects.    Like many other developers, the Hines company also is stepping up its pursuit of real-estate brokers. Every month and a half, brokers in Houston receive caramel apples, Texas chili and other food gifts via messenger from the company. Pat L. Harris, a vice president of the Hines company, says, &quot;This soft market has taught us that we have to do something that will make (brokers) remember us. We can't just send letters with our logo.&quot;    Other developers are courting brokers more extravagantly. John Cushman, who recently completed a 21-story office building in Burbank, Calif., threw a big bash there earlier this month for 550 real-estate brokers and prospective tenants. The gala featured a live band, mimes and magicians, and a laser show. &quot;I've always held the theory that people sell space and you don't have to do all that stuff,&quot; Mr. Cushman says. &quot;But leasing has been slower than I would have liked. The party stirred up a feverish pitch, and we got people here to see the building, which was the most important step.&quot;    For any broker who snares a five-floor lease for the building, Mr. Cushman is offering a special prize: a five-day, all-expense-paid trip for four couples, via his private jet, to his ranch in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming.    Albert Seeno Jr., a Pittsburg, Calif., developer, also is offering incentives. Mr. Seeno is building two 10-story office buildings in Concord, Calif., where the vacancy rate for office space has hit a whopping 33%. For placing tenants in his buildings, brokers can win prizes ranging from a pair of season passes for a California ski resort to his-and-hers Rolls Royces to a $500,000 home.    Some developers question the use of incentives. &quot;I'd rather create a building that puts bottom-line efficiency in the tenant's pocket, rather than the broker's pocket,&quot; says Christopher F. McGratty, president of Tishman Realty Corp., which is building an office tower near Mr. Seeno's.    Eric Haag, a Grubb andamp; Ellis Inc. broker employed by Mr. Seeno to help lease the buildings, dismisses the criticism. &quot;Mr. Seeno would rather give prizes away to brokers than to the bank in the form of interest&quot; payments, he says. Since the program began, he says, two prizes have been awarded.    Despite softness in the Manhattan condominium market, New York developer Donald Trump says the marketing and advertising for his latest project, Trump Parc, hasn't changed a bit.    More than a third of the project is sold, Mr. Trump says, even though it won't be completed until late next year, and the buyers include Larry Hagman of &quot;Dallas.&quot; &quot;We're so successful that there's no need to do anything different,&quot; Mr. Trump says.    Of course, his widely publicized renovation of the skating rink in New York's Central Park, which is within view of the project, didn't hurt sales. Was the renovation an indirect form of marketing? &quot;It did generate a lot of good will,&quot; he concedes. &quot;I'm not going to tell you it hurt our sales.&quot;    Mr. Gordon, meanwhile, has another novel advertising scheme in mind for Blue Hill Plaza. He plans to hire a blimp early next year, tether it near the Tappan Zee Bridge and put a sign on it advising commuters heading for Manhattan that if their offices were at Blue Hill Plaza, they would be at work in five minutes.    ---                        Plenty of Room   Downtown office vacancy rates in selected cities,September 1986    Atlanta                                          15%    Baltimore                                        13    Boston                                            9    Chicago                                          11    Dallas                                           20    Denver                                           29    Fort Lauderdale                                  28    Houston                                          18    Kansas City                                      19    Los Angeles                                      18    Miami                                            22    New Orleans                                      24    New York (Midtown Manhattan)                      9    Philadelphia                                     11    Phoenix                                          21    San Antonio                                      22    San Diego                                        18    San Francisco                                    16    Seattle                                          16    Washington, D.C.                                 10   Source: Coldwell Banker</TEXT></DOC>
