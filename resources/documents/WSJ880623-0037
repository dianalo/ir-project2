Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CANDA JAPAN EUROP FREST </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar leaped in hectic trading to its highest level in months, propelling the U.S. stock market to a post-crash high and sparking a surge in bond prices.    The dollar's climb -- and a lack of activity by central banks to restrain it -- helped boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average 43.03 points to 2152.20, topping the previous post-crash high of 2131.40 set last week.    U.S. Treasury bond prices posted their fifth-largest one-day gain this year, about 1 3/4 points, or $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Precious-metal prices slumped as these traditional inflation hedges were undermined by the dollar's strength.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 128.93 yen, up 2% from 126.41 yen late Tuesday. The last time the dollar stood this high against the yen was in early March, according to Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    The dollar also rose 1.5% to 1.7821 marks from 1.7550 marks a day earlier, hitting its highest point against the West German currency since late October. Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.7660 from $1.7899 Tuesday.    The dollar continued climbing in early Thursday morning Tokyo trading to 129.80 yen and 1.7865 marks before a wave of commercial selling pushed it back down to 128.75 yen and 1.7793 marks, or just below its late Wednesday New York levels.    &quot;Between 7:30 {a.m.} and 9 {a.m.} Tokyo time, securities companies and banks came into a thin market and bought a large amount of dollars,&quot; said Shigeru Nakayama, a senior vice president and regional treasury manager at First Interstate Bank of California in Tokyo.    But a little later, Japanese traders said that both corporations and institutional investors quickly began selling the U.S. currency to take profits from the earlier rally and to re-establish hedges against a possible dollar decline.    &quot;They bought yesterday and are selling today,&quot; said Soichi Hirabayashi, deputy general manager of the treasury division at Fuji Bank in Tokyo. &quot;Most market people feel that conserving dollars isn't so safe for the medium-term. This level is too high for the dollar.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Nakayama predicted the U.S. currency wouldn't fall below 128.25 yen. &quot;Exporters sell dollars, but I don't think they have so many dollars to sell,&quot; he said.    The dollar's surge encouraged foreign buying of U.S. stocks, traders and money managers said. U.S. stock-index futures rose to substantial premiums over individual-stock prices, triggering several rounds of program trading that buoyed stocks.    &quot;The stock market needed a positive change of psychology,&quot; said James Awad, president of BMI Capital, a New York money-management firm.    Dollar and bond rallies began Wednesday morning in Tokyo with what dealers characterized as very large buying orders from Japanese securities firms, auto companies, trading houses and insurance concerns to cover short positions.    Bonds got a further lift when the U.S. reported an unexpected drop in durable-goods orders, easing inflation jitters. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 8.92% from 9.09% in New York, and yields continued to slide in early Tokyo trading.    &quot;Some securities firms and life insurance companies sold yen bonds in the Tokyo market and bought U.S. Treasury bonds, so they had to buy dollars against yen,&quot; said Saburo Ueda, a senior vice president at Sanwa Bank in New York.    Traders cited reports that a senior official at the Bank of Japan said it would monitor the dollar's rise for the week to see whether it was only temporary. &quot;When that came out, all the traders took it as a sign that there wouldn't be intervention, and they brought the dollar up,&quot; said Jack Kessler, a senior vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan Bank's foreign-exchange operations in New York.    While traders didn't specifically attribute the dollar's surge to the meeting of leaders and finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries, Mr. Kessler said: &quot;When you get a statement like that from a Bank of Japan official, you almost assume it comes out of G-7.&quot;    At the summit, the seven nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- reaffirmed their commitment to a stable dollar.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Tuesday night that the dollar's recent strength wasn't &quot;a reason for concern&quot; among the G-7 countries. Nonetheless, U.S. officials have privately indicated their willingness to tolerate a still stronger currency, but the market remains uncertain of what that level is.    The dollar started piercing key points on charts in Asia that many traders use to predict currency movements. &quot;Once the dollar broke through the 1.7720 (mark)-level, it triggered an awful lot of short-covering, and the greenback's climb began to feed on itself,&quot; said Victor M. Polce, a vice president at Bear Stearns.    &quot;That left open territory for the market to buy dollars,&quot; said Mr. Kessler. &quot;After that, there was unwinding of yen/mark and yen/Swiss franc cross positions; most people were long yen and short Deutsche marks and short Swiss.&quot;    The dollar's jump forced Japanese exporters and institutions to scramble to buy dollars. For months they have hedged their anticipated U.S. receivables and investments by selling the dollar in the forward foreign-exchange market, where currencies are bought and sold for future delivery, said Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader for Bank of Tokyo in New York.    Moreover, he said some exporters had even sold dollar call options -- in some instances, in amounts larger than their commercial demand for the currency.    &quot;That means that exporters and institutional investors were ready for a dollar decline but not its rise,&quot; said Mr. Udagawa. &quot;When the dollar went higher, they had to start unwinding the hedges at 127 yen and 128 yen and buying back dollars.&quot;    &quot;A lot of things perhaps are coming together,&quot; said Gordon Bowyer, president of Credit Suisse Asset Management Inc., a New York-based unit of Credit Suisse. He pointed to the declining U.S. trade deficit, the economic coordination emanating from the Toronto summit meeting and the proposal by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) to raise taxes.    Dealers said currency markets have shrugged off recent interest-rate rises by West Germany, Britain and Switzerland and limited intervention by the West German and British central banks. On Tuesday, the Bundesbank increased its securities repurchase rate to 3.50% from 3.25% and, yesterday, sold small amounts of dollars for marks.    Also yesterday, the Bank of England pushed British banks to raise their base lending rate one-half percentage point to 9%. The British central bank also intervened, selling marks and buying pounds. But one London trader said the &quot;dollar seemed to actually strengthen when the U.K. base rate strengthened.&quot;    Dealers said the Bundesbank hadn't intervened at the Frankfurt fixing and took that as a signal that the central bank was willing to tolerate a stronger dollar.    Mr. Polce of Bear Stearns predicted the dollar would &quot;consolidate its gains and we will trade up to 1.80 marks sometime next week.&quot; He also sees the U.S. currency climbing to 1.90 marks and 133 to 135 yen by year end.    Others were less sure. &quot;With panic buying (the dollar) could go to 1.79 or 1.80 marks,&quot; said Gerhard Hechler head of corporate dealing for DG Bank in Frankfurt. But he said profit-taking would set in, limiting the climb.    In addition, Mr. Ueda of Sanwa Bank said that &quot;over the 130-yen level, the Bank of Japan will fear inflation in Japan and do something in the market: Intervene heavily or raise interest rates.&quot;    Traders also said the dollar's outlook is still clouded by the U.S. budget gap and the current-account trade deficit.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $449.50 an ounce, down $2.30. Estimated volume was a moderate 4.25 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $448.60 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Wednesday, June 22, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
