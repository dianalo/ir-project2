The central bank, as directed by savings and loan legislationsigned by President Bush on Aug. 9, lifted previous restrictionsMonday that had prevented Citicorp, the nation's largest bankingcompany, from operating the thrifts ``in tandem'' with itscommercial banks.   The restrictions were designed to prevent bank holding companiesfrom buying up Sandamp;Ls in states where they would otherwise berestricted under interstate banking prohibitions from buyingcommercial banks.   But as part of an effort to attract more capital to the thriftindustry, Congress decided to permit bank holding companies for thefirst time to buy healthy Sandamp;Ls and run them without the operatingrestrictions.   In a related action, the Fed lifted the tandem restrictionimposed on Michigan National Corp.'s operation of Beverly HillsFederal Savings Bank.   Citicorp and Michigan National were the only two bank holdingcompanies that owned thrifts subject to the restriction.</TEXT></DOC>
