Both Paul Volcker, the Fed's chairman, and Alan Greenspan, President Reagan's nominee as the next chairman, are scheduled to testify at hearings that are likely to produce important clues to the Fed's credit policy plans as well as the economic outlook.    Mr. Greenspan will appear at a Senate banking committee confirmation hearing. Mr. Volcker will present the Fed's midyear economic projections and money supply targets at a hearing of a House banking subcommittee on domestic monetary policy.    Although some analysts expect Mr. Greenspan to be a clone of Mr. Volcker, many others say he may prove surprising. They contend that he will take an even tougher anti-inflation stance than Mr. Volcker, especially in the next few months, in an effort to underscore the Fed's independence and prove that the Fed won't be a puppet of the Reagan administration.    &quot;The one thing any central banker wants to avoid at all costs is to be labeled as soft on inflation,&quot; said Donald H. Straszheim, president of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. &quot;That is death.&quot; Thus, he said, at the first hint of higher inflation, Mr. Greenspan &quot;is likely to move especially quickly to tighten&quot; credit, driving up short-term interest rates, to &quot;establish his credentials as an inflation fighter.&quot;    One event that could trigger an early test of the Fed's resolve would be a slump of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets. Many analysts predict such a decline this summer because they say foreign investors rapidly are losing patience with the slow progress the U.S. is making in whittling down its trade and budget deficits. A falling dollar would intensify inflationary pressures by leading to higher prices on imported goods. It also could discourage foreign investors from investing in U.S. securities.    &quot;I think there is a 50-50 chance of an exchange-rate crisis in the next few months, with a sharp associated rise in interest rates,&quot; said Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities International Inc. &quot;In that case, the board under Alan will have to tighten quickly.&quot; Such a move would &quot;demonstrate to the market that he is in there to keep inflation under control and to have a stable environment for our currency,&quot; said Mr. Axilrod, who was formerly the Federal Reserve Board's staff director for monetary and financial policy.    Even Mr. Greenspan's admirers say there is a lingering suspicion about his independence from the Reagan administration. &quot;I think the markets wonder about the strength of his convictions as an independent economist and thinker,&quot; Mr. Axilrod said in an interview on The Wall Street Journal Report, a weekly television program. He quickly added that &quot;I don't have any doubts about him&quot; but that the perception does exist.    If the dollar goes into a tailspin, many analysts agree that the sooner Fed officials react, the better. Moreover, they say, a small credit-tightening move this summer or fall could save the Fed from having to administer stronger medicine next year when political pressures will be far more intense.    Mr. Greenspan once offered similar advice. In an interview in December 1983, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed would be well-advised to tighten credit slightly before the 1984 political season got into full swing.    &quot;If the Fed is going to tighten, now is the time to do it,&quot; Mr. Greenspan said in an interview that appeared in The Wall Street Journal Dec. 19, 1983. &quot;The period in which the Fed could tighten policy with a minimum amount of political repercussions is over the next few weeks. When Congress gets back and the presidential primaries begin next year, it is going to be more difficult for the Fed to function, either tightening policy or easing, without creating great political stirrings.&quot;    Nevertheless, economic conditions now are different than they were then, and some analysts say the economy is so sluggish that the Fed won't have to worry about inflationary pressures any time soon.    &quot;I've known Alan for a long time, and I don't think he is going to risk jeopardizing the economy simply to demonstrate his credentials as an inflation-fighter,&quot; said Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. &quot;To do so would be irresponsible and reckless beyond comprehension.&quot;    Mr. Robertson and several other analysts expect little or no changes in Fed policy for the next few months. Milton Hudson, a senior vice president at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the economy &quot;isn't very strong,&quot; that Fed policy won't change significantly, and that interest rates &quot;are likely to move essentially sideways for the next few months.&quot;    Mr. Greenspan's closeness with the Reagan administration, which some analysts fear could be his major weakness, also could prove to be a source of strength. He is widely expected to be offered a prominent role in choosing new Fed governors as vacancies occur. There already is one vacancy because of the resignation last year of Henry Wallich. He also may be able to work more closely with the Reagan administration on plans to reduce the government's budget deficit.    Kathleen Cooper, senior vice president and chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, agrees that some investors are leery of Mr. Greenspan. &quot;There is no question people are keenly worried that Alan is too close to the Reagan administration and therefore will pursue an easier monetary policy than others,&quot; she said.    But Mrs. Cooper argues that such speculation is wrong, and she disagrees with the theory that Mr. Greenspan will feel obligated to take an even tougher attitude toward inflation than Mr. Volcker. She predicts Mr. Greenspan will move &quot;very cautiously,&quot; especially at the outset.    This view was echoed by David M. Jones, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. &quot;A lot of people have talked about the idea that the Fed under Greenspan will launch a preemptive strike against inflation, but I don't think he will do that,&quot; he said. Mr. Greenspan, he continues, &quot;will be a strong inflation-fighter, but he will wait until he sees clear-cut evidence before he takes a stand.&quot;    Mr. Jones also said it will take Mr. Greenspan some time &quot;to acquaint himself with the inner workings of the Fed, gain the respect the other board members, take command and get enough votes at board meetings.&quot;    Mr. Greenspan may encounter some difficulty leading the Reserve Board. &quot;A very strong leader is leaving, and all the other members have very little tenure&quot; at the Fed, said Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch. &quot;So I think they (the other board members) will be more inclined to go their own separate ways and be less inclined to go along with the chairman.&quot;    In any case, the dollar's fate will be a major factor influencing Fed policy, most analysts agree. &quot;So long as the dollar is relatively strong and the economy continues to perk along in the modest way it has lately, I think Fed policy can ease off,&quot; said Mr. Axilrod.    Mr. Volcker is expected at tomorrow's hearing to underscore his deep concern about the size of the budget and trade deficits and the nation's dependence on foreign capital. Most analysts expect him to announce that the Fed has decided to leave its money supply targets unchanged. However, a few say that the Fed should reduce its growth targets for both this year and 1988 because such a move would bolster confidence in the central bank's inflation-fighting resolve.    When Mr. Greenspan takes over as Fed chairman, he &quot;will have to lean over backwards to avoid being accused of playing politics with monetary policy,&quot; Mr. Straszheim said. Mr. Greenspan &quot;could turn out to be even tighter (with credit policy) than almost anyone else because of his background of working for a Republican administration.&quot;    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Bond prices rose in quiet trading, staying in a relatively narrow band all day. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 4.88 points to close at 1296.96. It hovered between 1295.27 and 1298.96.    Among closely watched issues, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to 102 1/32 from 101 20/32 Thursday. The yield fell to 8.56% from 8.60%. The government's 8 1/2% notes rose to 100 28/32 from 100 19/32, while the yield fell to 8.36% from 8.4%. And the government's 7 7/8% notes due May 1990 rose slightly to 100 22/32 from 100 20/32, lowering the yield to 7.59% from 7.62%.    Among short-term interest rates, the federal funds rate averaged 6.57%. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, has fallen from around 6 3/4% during the first three weeks of June, fortifying the conviction that the Fed has eased credit pressure a bit.    The latest three-month Treasury bill rate fell slightly to 5.57% bid from 5.59% Thursday, while the latest six-month bill rate rose to 5.61% bid from 5.59%. </TEXT></DOC>
