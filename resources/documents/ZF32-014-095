Brock Jr., director of government information andmanagement in GAO's Information Management and Technology Division, said atthe hearing.andM;&quot;Agencies are plagued by poor ADP and IRM practices,&quot; Brock said, adding that&quot;GSA has a proper oversight role.&quot;andP;  This means GSA must do more reviews ofthe agencies' internal IRM practices, he said.andM;GSA uses the IRM reviews to decide if agencies' blanket delegations ofprocurement authority need to be raised, lowered or kept the same.andP;  GSA nowconducts six reviews a year, taking about six months to complete each one.andO;Officials recently said they would try to get nine reviews done annually fromnow on.andM;But for the individual APR reviews, GSA does not do global comparisons ofproblems uncovered during the management reviews, which means it is missingthe chance to identify weaknesses across the agencies, GAO said.andP;  A databaseof recurring problems would help GSA train employees and point out problemsto managers in the agencies, said the report, ADP Procurement: GSA Needs toImprove Its Review Process to Enhance Its ADP Oversight.andM;GSA spokesman Robert Fiser said GSA officials had no comment on the reportnow.andP;  He said agency officials only just began reviewing the report and mayhave no response at all.andM;GSA also does not assess its own reviews to see if they are carried outeffectively, the report said.andM;GSA has a microcomputer-based APR database management system, but GAO said itdoes not record specific conditions placed on an agency in its DPAs.andP;  Thedatabase does not note when agencies are required to submit status reports toGSA on procurements, so analysts get no automatic notification when a statusreport is due.andM;&quot;Since the analysts have a heavy workload and little time to manuallyresearch the files and take appropriate follow-up action, GSA has noassurance that provisions required as part of its DPA are being fulfilled,&quot;GAO said.andM;GAO directed sharp criticism at GSA's staffing levels in its AuthorizationBranch.andP;  The report said the branch has 16 staff positions dedicated to APRreviews and six positions for administrative and technical support.andP;  Butbetween December 1989 and April 1991, GAO said, the branch averaged threevacancies each month, and three staff members were transferred to fill in atoffices outside the branch.andM;&quot;In all, almost 40 percent of the staff dedicated to APR reviews wereunavailable to review APRs,&quot; the report said.andM;Also, poor organization hampers APR analysts' review efforts, GAO said.andO;Files are passed around inside and outside the branch &quot;without a controllingsign-out procedure,&quot; the report said.andP;  &quot;As a result, analysts must rely ontheir memory to recall where a file is located.&quot;andM;On a positive note, GAO said analysts demonstrated a corporate knowledge ofagency actions and often recalled specifics of APR reviews.andP;  Some GSA effortshave improved the ADP procurement process, GAO said, but more could be done.andM;For the GSA audit, GAO studied 16 APR reviews, including two Trail Bossrequests.andP;  The Trail Boss APR reviews contained better documentation and moreevidence of interaction with agency officials than the others studied, thereport said.andM;Also, in February 1990 GSA changed the way it handled procurement reviews.andO;Before then, all APRs were reviewed the same way, regardless of howpotentially expensive or risky a buy might be.andP;  Now, GSA classifies APRs inthree tiers.andM;Accelerated reviews, done for about 30 percent of the APRs, cover lower-costbuys and must be approved or rejected within five days.andP;  Abbreviated reviews,done for about 65 percent of the APR's, can take up to 20 days.andO;Comprehensive reviews cover 5 percent of the APRs and have a 30-day deadline.andM;GSA officials are studying other changes in the procurement process,including raising the $2.5 million delegation of procurement authoritythreshold.andP;  For all buys above $2.5 million, agencies must first have GSAapproval.andM;In fiscal 1989, 632 buys worth $18 billion required GSA approval.andP;  In fiscal1990, those figures jumped to 735 buys worth $20 billion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
