 70 Garden Ct., BoxDRI Monterey, CA 93942 (800) 443-4200 List Price: $495 Requires: 512K RAM,andM;DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: Artline is colorful, competent and priced right.andP;  Aside from a fewmissing drawing tools, this is a well-rounded package; its strength is in itstreatment of text and its accessibility to Bitstream fonts.andP;  Output speed isfast, and the GEM connection to Ventura Publisher is a big plus.andM;Gem Artline is the $495 illustration component of Digital Research's familyof desktop publishing software.andP;  Developed by a German firm, CCPSoftware-Entwicklungs, the program operates under GEM Desktop, the DigitalResearch graphical environment manager supplied with the program.andM;While the GEM environment may be unfamiliar to mouse users more accustomed toMicrosoft Windows, Artline files are capable of being ported directly toVentura Publisher, the popular high-end desktop publishing program (and arecent PC Magazine Editor's Choice), that also runs under GEM.andP;  Unlike AdobeIllustrator and some other Windows-based packages, Artline performs at aperfectly acceptable speed on a standard 286 machine.andM;Installation is in two parts: GEM Desktop first and Artline second.andP;  Artlineitself is quickly installed via a setup program.andP;  A mouse is the standarddrawing tool, but Artline and Desktop also permit use of the keyboard.andO;Usually a cumbersome way to move around, the keyboard is sometimes veryuseful.andP;  For instance, if your machine has only one serial port and both yourmouse and output device are serial, you can use the keyboard to output adrawing.andM;On-screen, Artline appears with a white drawing surface; menu boxes withdrawing tools are clustered on the left side of the screen, and pull-downediting menus are arrayed along the top.andP;  The program offers seven levels ofmagnification of the drawing surface, which soon becomes a frequently usedfunction; drawing detailed images requires close scrutiny, but you need toalternate that with zoom-outs for overviews of the picture.andM;Artline's actual drawing tools are limited to three: curves, rectangles, andellipses.andP;  Curves can be drawn as Bezier splines or as a series of straightline segments.andP;  Hence an ordinary straight line is a special case of a curve.andO;The same holds true for the square as a subset of rectangles and the circleas a special case of the ellipse.andP;  You can generate a horizontal or verticalline, square, or circle fairly easily using the snap option or the editingtools.andP;  The snap function automatically aligns or objects to the rectilineargrid, but ultimately my wish list for GEM Artline would include a built-intool for creating horizontal and vertical lines.andM;STRONG POINTSandM;The real potency of illustration software in general, and of Artline inparticular, lies in its ability to edit and transform an object once it hasbeen drawn on the screen.andP;  Artline has a powerful collection of tools tomanipulate objects, ranging from something as simple as a single straightline to a complex graphic consisting of thousands of subobjects all joinedtogether.andP;  The number of editable objects is limited only by the memory inyour machine.andP;  Scaling, rotation, translation (moving from one point toanother), mirroring or flipping, and skewing (shearing an object along one orboth axes) are well supported by Artline.andP;  Selected objects can even beplaced in front of or behind other objects.andM;Of particular interest is the &quot;rolling pin&quot; function, which allows arectilinear object to be distorted along two axes in order to create a pseudothree-dimensional effect in this two-dimensional program.andP;  Not only is thissometimes useful, but it is also wonderfully playful.andP;  Also noteworthy isArtlinehs move function.andP;  Moving and copying an object can be accomplished byentering the horizontal and vertical distances, and the quantity of objectsto be replicated.andM;Artline has 16 colors available at a time (in 100 shades) and seven presetgray scales for each color.andP;  Gray scales can also be specified in 1 percentincrements, including 0 percent and 100 percent (the default value).andM;If you are sending your output to a PostScript device, Artline hascolor-separation abilities.andP;  Four-color separations (cyan, yellow, magenta,black) are possible (although the feature would be more impressive if youcould blend the colors); 16 separate spot-color separations can also becreated.andM;IMPRESSIVE TEXT CAPABILITIESandM;Text is another of Artline's strong points.andP;  Five standard fonts areavailable, and it is possible to generate nine additional typefaces from theincluded Bitstream Fontware installation kit.andP;  Additional Bitstream fonts canbe purchased separately and used with Artline, giving the program vast choiceof type.andP;  While Fontware fonts cost about $195 per typeface, they are still agood deal.andP;  Not only are Bitstream fonts of high quality, but they can alsobe used in Ventura Publisher, PageMaker, Microsoft Word, and WordPerfect.andM;Text entry is done through a separate window where spacing, leading, andkerning are all user-selectable.andP;  When text entry is finished, the textwindow closes and the text appears on the drawing.andP;  While this procedure doesnot allow instant visualization, once you're back in the drawing, the textcan be selected as a graphic object and treated like a piece of art.andO;Individual letters or the entire text can become objects, thus allowing thefull range of graphic transformations to be performed on them.andM;Eleven finished art samples are provided with Artline, as well as tenlibraries of symbols; together, these create a modest collection of clip art.andO;Generating your own symbols is a simple matter, and you'll find that usingsymbols can speed up the drawing process considerably.andP;  By clicking anddragging the mouse, the symbol can be compacted to microscopic size orstretched to full screen size.andM;Artline accepts file input from Lotus 1-2-3 (.PIC), PC Paintbrush (.PCX), andscanners (.TIF).andP;  Scanned graphics can be traced, but you'll need expandedmemory.andP;  Output files are in the native .GEM and PostScript (.EPS) formats.andO;The .GEM files are compact--the test illustration of the classical columnswas just 31K--and output to a PostScript device is far faster with Artlinethan it is with a Windows-based application.andM;A wide variety of output devices is supported, although in some cases,additional device drivers must be purchased from Digital Research.andP;  Forinstance, the HPGL plotter device driver will cost $10, plus $5 for shippingand handling.andP;  All output (besides PostScript output) is handled by GEMDesktop (printing can take place at the highest resolution of any printer(GEM supports).andP;  Fortunately, the output transition between Artline andDesktop is seamless and painless.andM;Documentation comes in three parts: the Desktop guide, an Artline reference,and an Artline user guide.andP;  In the future, it would be helpful if DRI wouldconsolidate the two slim Artline guides into a single volume, therebyeliminating the need to switch between them continually.andP;  The documentation,while seeming to be not very detailed at first glance, ultimately answersalmost all your perplexing questions.andM;Artline is a strong package, despite a few missing features in its drawingtoolbox, and it's a relative bargain in this category of software.andP;  Theprogram's full range of functions supplies professional artists with all thetools they need to get the job done.andP;  On top of that, the user interface iscordial and responsive.andP;  Artline illustration software has broad artisticapplicability.andP;  In disciplines like graphic design, the ease with which itlets artists manipulate text and graphics will surely help to transform theirworking methods permanently.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
