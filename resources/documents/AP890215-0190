Marc Christian, 35, won $3.5 million more than he had sought inthe case, regarded as a precedent-setting action and watched closelyby lawyers. No similar case has had a like result when the plaintiffhas not developed AIDS.   Hudson, the handsome Hollywood leading man who kept hishomosexuality a closely guarded secret, died Oct. 5, 1985, at age58, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public knowledge.   Christian, who smiled when the verdict was read, has consistentlytested negative for the AIDS virus, but claimed he was entitled tocompensation for the emotional distress he suffered in fear that hewould develop the disease.   Christian declined to comment when he left the courtroom. A gagorder imposed by Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert at the startof testimony last month remained in effect while the jury decidespunitive damages.   Geernaert ordered jurors to remain silent when they left thecourtroom and told them they must return Thursday morning to hearfurther evidence and deliberate on the question of punitive damages.   The damages awarded Wednesday were compensatory, meaning they areto compensate Christian for actual losses. Punitive damages could beintended to punish the defendants for their actions.   With attorneys also prohibited from talking to reporters, thesize of Hudson's estate also remained unknown. The value of Hudson'sestate was not disclosed in his will when it was filed in November1985.   The will established a trust, and contained no details about thetrust except to say the value of the estate exceeded $10,000.   The jury ruled that Hudson conspired with secretary Mark Millerto keep secret the actor's disease to induce Christian to continuehaving high-risk sex with Hudson.   Miller, who also was found liable, didn't visibly react to theverdict, but leaned over to talk with his attorney.   One of the 37 questions on a complicated verdict sheet filled outby the Superior Court jury was: ``Did Rock Hudson engage inoutrageous conduct?'' The jury answered: ``Yes.''   The jurors also ruled that Christian suffered emotional distressbecause he wasn't told about the actor's condition.   The verdict was viewed as a landmark by Margaret Davis, a LosAngeles attorney and author of ``Lovers, Doctors and the Law,'' abook on the legal consequences of transmitting sexual diseases.   ``The jury is telling America that you have to make full andcomplete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease,''Ms. Davis said.   ``It's absolutely a landmark case,'' she said.   A spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, Steven Petrov,said Christian had a right to know that Hudson had AIDS.   ``We find it a troubling case because it places the entire burdenof safe sex on one individual and not the two,'' Petrov said. ``Itunderscores for us again the need for everyone who engages in sexualactivity to take responsibilityy for themselves as well as for theirpartners.''   Christian, who lived with Hudson during the last two years of theactor's life, testified the couple continued to have high-risk sexfor eight months after Hudson was told he had AIDS in June 1984.   Christian and his attorney argued the actor had a duty to warnhis lover he had the disease. They accused Miller, one of the chiefbeneficiaries of Hudson's will, of conspiring to keep the actor'sdisease secret from Christian.   In a seven-week trial punctuated by detailed testimony about thecouple's sex practices, attorneys for Miller and the Hudson estateportrayed Christian as a gigolo who took money for sex and had onlya brief relationship with the actor.   Christian's attorney introduced as evidence sentimental loveletters he received from Hudson to buttress his claim the actorloved Christian. Witnesses told of spying on Hudson and Christianwhile they engaged in homosexual sex.</TEXT></DOC>
