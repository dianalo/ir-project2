(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A half-century ago as Adolf Hitler's warmachine was crushing Polish resistance to the west, Josef Stalinsent the Red Army to wrest this city of forested hills and medievalchurches from eastern Poland.   For Lvov's Ukrainian population, the outbreak of World War II inSeptember 1939 was the beginning of a bloody new series of battlesacross their land.   It ended, just as the feuding of Russians, Germans, Swedes,Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians in this area had ended forcenturies, with Lvov being incorporated into a new country.   Now, a stubborn streak of nationalism has reappeared, denouncingboth Polish and Soviet rule as occupation and seeking to encompassall of the Soviet Union's second-most populous republic in whatnationalists dream will one day be an independent Ukraine.   To make that point, a small group of organizers planned anopen-air religious service, march and rally for Sunday to mark theday Soviet troops marched into Poland. They expected 100,000 peopleto take part.   ``This will be a day of mourning,'' said Ivan Gel, the head ofthe lay council of an underground Ukrainian church loyal to theVatican but outlawed since the area's incorporation into the SovietUnion.   Soviet control began Sept. 17, 1939, two and a half weeks afterHitler started World War II by attacking Poland and less than amonth after he and Stalin reached a non-aggression agreement with asecret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.   The Red Army moved into Poland along a broad front encompassingwhat is now the western portions of the Ukraine and Byelorussiarepublics of the Soviet Union.   ``This was aggression, and a second occupation after theoccupation by Poland,'' said Bogdan Gorin, a leader of the UkrainianHelsinki group, which was formed to monitor human rights in therepublic of 52 million people.   Before World War I, Lvov as well as Poland itself, was part ofthe Russian empire. After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, Polish andSoviet armies fought back and forth between Warsaw and Kiev before apeace finally gave the western Ukraine to Poland.   The Soviet Union retained the rest of the Ukraine, which sufferedseverely through collectivization and famine during the 1930s.   Oleg Vitovich, a 23-year-old factory worker and Helsinki groupmember, said that in the context of the Nazi attack on westernPoland, Lvov residents were friendly to the Soviet soldiers whenthey arrived in 1939.   But almost two years of deportations and executions followed,until the Nazis invaded and seized the territory. It stayed underGerman control for three years.   Despite the cruelty of the Nazis, the attitude toward the Sovietsoldiers had changed, Vitovich said. ``By 1944, when the Red Armycame through here on its way to Berlin, the people didn't meet themwith flowers, but with guns in their hands, with bullets,'' he said.   Armed bands of Ukrainians held out against Soviet power in thehills of the western Ukraine for almost a decade after the war endedin 1945.   Resistance to Soviet domination has resurfaced, much as it has inthe Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to the northand in Moldavia to the south.   Lvov activists joined enthusiastically with more than 1,000 otherUkrainians in the republic's capital of Kiev on Sept. 8-10 to foundthe Narodny Ruk, a grassroots political movement. The movement takesin environmentalists, a Ukrainian language society and the localaffiliate of a national organization dedicated to the memory of thevictims of Stalin's terror.   Even though the movement still is in its infancy, the prospect ofgrowing Ukrainian demands for independence is a troubling one forthe Soviet Union.   It is one thing when the Baltic republics with less than 8million people demand sovereignty, but quite another if the Ukraine,with a powerful industrial and agricultural base and close ethnicties to Russia, does the same.   The Ukraine's Communist Party leadership has moved slowly incoming to grips with demands by informal political groups. But it isconsidering legislation that would make Ukrainian the officiallanguage. Such laws have been the starting point for strong ethnicmovements in other Soviet regions.   Ukrainians have flooded a downtown Lvov park with flowers in aninformal memorial to their national poet, Taras Shevchenko. Theyellow-and-blue Ukrainian national flag, representing golden wheatand blue sky, flies constantly. Crowds gather to debate the latestpolitical news and sing Ukrainian national songs.   Ivan G. Postoronko, the Communist Party chief in theIvano-Frankovsk region of the western Ukraine, told a party meetingin Moscow in July that the activity of the underground UkrainianCatholic, or Uniate, Church was increasing alarmingly.   ``The so-called Uniate question is nothing more than a cover fornationalism,'' he said.   When World War II came, some Ukrainians cooperated with theNazis, and in its official accounts the Soviet Union blames theresistance after World War II on collaborators. The official versionis especially harsh on the Ukrainian Catholic Church.   The church was forced to merge with the Russian Orthodox Churchafter the war and believers were repressed, but it has continued toexist. Ukrainian nationalists are demanding that the church belegalized.   Vitovich said the Helsinki group is seeking to work with otherinformal political groups to gradually win more freedom for therepublic.   ``Without the establishment of sovereignty, return of ournational symbols and self-accounting, it's not possible to solve theseparate language problem,'' Vitovich said. ``It can be solved onlyas a complex.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Sept. 17</NOTE></DOC>
