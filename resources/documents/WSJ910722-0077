Internal government memos reviewed by this newspaperreveal how a June 6 proposal by the Environmental ProtectionAgency on a top-priority issue for electric utilities endedup highly favorable to the utility industry.</LP><TEXT>   In an unusual regulatory process, White House economistsand the Energy Department played a heavy hand in pressuringthe EPA to insert provisions that would relax currentregulatory practices and could help power plants avoid asmuch as $5 billion in pollution-control costs.   Even the Justice Department has questioned whether certaincomponents of the proposal are legal, according to acongressional staffer and government employees who have seena confidential memo from the department.   Although the EPA by law is in charge of drafting rules tocarry out the Clean Air Act, objections by career technicaland legal staff at the agency were overridden on certain keyprovisions. In one memo, Energy Department positions thatlater were included in the proposal were blasted as &quot;hogwash&quot;and &quot;mostly garbage&quot; in margin notes penned by Greg Foote,EPA assistant general counsel.   &quot;In effect, the EPA rule-making process has beenhijacked,&quot; said Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who calledBush administration officials to Capitol Hill today totestify on the legality of the utility proposal. &quot;What wehave,&quot; he said, &quot;is a shadow government, responsiveapparently exclusively to industry, dictating theadministration's policy and forcing the EPA to go along withthat.&quot;   Allegations have surfaced previously that the Bushadministration is illegally trying to write into regulationwhat it couldn't convince Congress to write into theclean-air law. An earlier hearing by Rep. Waxman focused on aproposal for issuing pollution permits to industry.   White House officials claim the Clean Air Act's high cost-- at least $25 billion annually to industry by 2005 --justifies their unprecedented degree of involvement indrafting even the finest details of new clean-air rules.   In the case of the utility regulation, EPA AssistantAdministrator William Rosenberg argued in an interview thatCongress had its chance and failed to agree on how to fixwhat is widely known as the Wepco problem. It was named for acase involving Wisconsin Electric Power Co., a unit ofWisconsin Energy Corp. Mr. Rosenberg said the administrationset out to write a regulation to try to accomplish what itcouldn't convince Congress to do.   The Wepco rule is high stakes for the electric industry.It was meant to settle a controversy over when the nation'saging power plants must install costly antipollutionequipment, now required for new plants, when they dorefurbishment projects to replace parts, meet new acid-rainrequirements or, more broadly, to extend the lifetime oftheir plants.   Memos and correspondence show an unusual regulatoryprocess in which Richard Schmalensee, who has since left hisjob at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acted asmediator between the Energy Department, which wanted moreexemptions for electric plants doing refurbishment, and theEPA, which wanted to limit pollution increases to result fromconstruction work.   The EPA's original draft rule was scorned by EnergyDepartment Deputy Undersecretary Linda Stuntz, who complainedin one interagency memo that it wasn't &quot;responsive to theneeds of the electric utility industry.&quot;   Afterward, Mr. Schmalensee wrote a memo marked urgent tothe EPA that also criticized the agency's draft and spelledout steps on &quot;where and how the current draft must bemodified.&quot;   Conflict over whether the administration unlawfully wenttoo far in trying to instill flexibility for the industry islikely to be the basis for court challenges, unless there aremajor changes before the Wepco rule becomes final. TheNatural Resources Defense Council, an environmental groupthat often sues over regulations, has mailed out letters tomore than 90 utilities warning it thinks key portions of theproposal are illegal.   &quot;There is no question that these changes ignore the spiritand letter of the law,&quot; said David Hawkins, a senior attorneywith the NRDC and a former EPA regulator.   The administration is ready to defend its proposal. Mr.Rosenberg of the EPA said the proposal includes changes tofix legal problems cited by the Justice Department memo.Privately, however, some government employees contendlegality is still a question and the administration's defenseon certain issues is weak.   Mr. Rosenberg also argues that the proposal won't increasepollution because of acid-rain provisions and otherantipollution laws on the books. &quot;I'm not saying that theadministration's proposal reflected everything the EPAwanted. It didn't. But it was the proposal we accepted. Idon't think we're surrendering authority.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
