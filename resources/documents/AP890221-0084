The justices, without comment, let stand a California SupremeCourt ruling that Harold Freeman's conviction on charges ofprocuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedomof expression.   Freeman, president of the Hollywood Video Production Co., is inthe business of producing and marketing ``adult'' films. He producedand directed a 1983 film called ``Caught From Behind, Part II.   For the movie, Freeman hired actors and actresses who, as part oftheir roles, engaged in various sex acts.   Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Freeman with five countsof pandering, based on his hiring five actresses who performed inthe movie. Freeman was not charged with any violation of the state'sobscenity laws, and the movie was not formally judged to be obscene.   Freeman was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail amd fiveyears probation. He also was ordered to pay $10,000 in restitutionand a $100 fine.   The state Supreme Court threw out Freeman's conviction last Aug.25, ruling that California's pandering law should not have beenapplied to him.   Freeman was not procuring people for the purpose of prostitution,the state court said, because ``there is no evidence (he) paid theacting fees for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, hisown or the actors.''   The state court added that even if what the film's participantsengaged in could be classified as prostitution, ``the application ofthe pandering statute to the hiring of actors to perform in theproduction of a non-obscene motion picture would impingeunconstitutionally upon First Amendment values.''   The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees freedom of speechand expression.   On Feb. 1, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor turned down an emergencyrequest by county prosecutors seeking to postpone the effect of thestate Supreme Court's ruling until their formal appeal wasconsidered.   O'Connor predicted that the prosecutors' formal appeal would berejected because the state court ruling was based on aninterpretation of state law, and was thus ``binding upon thiscourt.''   The cases are California vs. Freeman, 88-1054, and Applegate vs.Freeman, 88-1050.</TEXT></DOC>
