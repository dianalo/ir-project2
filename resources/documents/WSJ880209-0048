<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880209-0048 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: McKesson Corp. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> MCK </CO><TEXT>   McKesson Corp. said it agreed to combine its loss-plagued office products operation with a unit of closely held SDC Distributing Corp., in exchange for a 20% interest in the combined operation and a promissory note for an amount it didn't disclose.    The San Francisco-based distributor of drugs, health-care products, wines and spirits and other consumer goods said it doesn't expect the move to have a material impact on earnings, despite certain onetime expenses.    The office products operation, with about 700 employees, had sales last year of about $175 million. McKesson said the operation had &quot;substantial&quot; losses over the past two years.    McKesson said the operation will be combined with Stationers Distributing Co., Fort Worth, Texas. Stationers was formed in 1985 through a management-led leveraged buy-out of Crown Zellerbach Corp.'s office products division.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, McKesson's stock closed at $27.375, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
