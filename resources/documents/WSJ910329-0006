The number of so-called elderly households, meanwhile, wasalmost unchanged at 4.2 million but still 2.6 times thenumber recorded in 1975, according to the government surveyreported by a Japanese news agency. Elderly households arecomposed of men at least 65 years old, women at least 60, orthe elderly living only with children under 18.   The survey, based on interviews with 52,000 families lastJune and July, put Japan's total number of households at40,273,000, a 2.2% rise from the previous year and the firsttime the figure has topped 40 million. The average size of ahousehold continued to drop, to 3.05 members from 3.1 a yearearlier.   The survey also said 60% of all households, about 24.2million, were &quot;nuclear families,&quot; those made up of only acouple, or a couple or single parent with unmarried children.Single-member households totaled 8.4 million, or 21%, up onepercentage point. Three generations lived together in 5.4million households.                                                                                                          ARGENTINE RAIL STRIKE ENDS                                                                                                          Railway workers called off a wildcat strike over pay thatdisrupted Argentina's train services for 44 days, the longeststoppage by state employees since President Carlos Menem tookoffice in July 1989. About 5,000 strikers, among about 85,000employees, decided to begin talks with the unprofitableFerrocarriles Argentinos. The government fired hundreds ofrail employees and closed four of the six main lines to tryto break the stoppage. The walkout began Feb. 13.                                                                                                          ISRAEL GETS MORE RUSSIAN PAPERS                                                                                                          The British press executive Robert Maxwell was beaten tothe newsstands by a competing publisher in starting aRussian-language weekly newspaper in Israel. He had saidVremia (Time), published by his Maariv newspaper, would makeits debut today. The rival mass-circulation daily YediothAhronoth got the jump with its first edition of YediothIsrael (News of Israel). The two weeklies are the latestadditions to the flourishing Russian press intended for acontinuing influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants. More than200,000 have arrived since late 1989.                                                                                                          AFRICA'S FOOD CRISIS WORSENS                                                                                                          Six African countries are threatened with mass starvationin a worsening food crisis, the United Nations said. Angola,Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Somalia and Sudan face faminebecause of civil war and drought. International food aid thisyear has fallen far short, the U.N. said. It forecast thatpoor harvests in southern Africa, including the traditionalsurplus producers Zimbabwe and South Africa, will worsen thecontinent's food shortages. In all, 17 sub-Saharan countrieshave food emergencies.                                                                                                          BUCHAREST, PRETORIA SET LINK                                                                                                          Romania and South Africa have established commercialrelations. They will open consulates in Bucharest and inJohannesburg. Romania said the decision is a step towarddiplomatic relations.                                                                                                          JAPANESE UTILITIES RE-ORIENT                                                                                                          Japanese power companies, some of which have recently beenforced to shut some of their nuclear power plants, haveindicated to their oil suppliers they will take increasedvolumes of oil to fuel thermal power plants in the fiscalyear that starts Monday. The supplies are expected to comemostly from Asian producers such as Indonesia, Vietnam andChina. Accidents and mechanical trouble have disabled threeof Japan's nuclear plants. The utilities' peak demand beginsin June.                                                                                                          SEOUL TO ALTER BANK CREDIT RULES                                                                                                          South Korea said it plans sweeping changes in its bankcredit regulations, a move intended to enhance businessefficiency. The government will ease controls on bank creditto conglomerates' major units, in hopes the companies willfocus on profitable niche businesses instead of diversifyingmore widely.   Seoul has maintained tight restrictions on credit grantedto large companies in a bid to discourage inflation andexcessive economic dominance by the giants.   The new system, to be implemented June 1 after revisingrelated laws, provides, among other things, for the country's30 largest conglomerates to select as many as fivesubsidiaries for eased credit controls. An earlier plan toease credit only to the manufacturing sector was dropped,following strong opposition by service-based conglomerates.   The decision is viewed as a significant step in increasingbanks' influence in propelling the nation's economic growth.Under the new regime, banks can take a more active role indetermining corporate lending policies.

In an Easter message, Archbishop Cosmo Francesco Ruppi ofLecce, Italy, appealed to Italians to &quot;stop the useless andstupid fashion of portable telephones&quot; and spend their moneyon worthier things. Many people use mobile phones not becausethey need them but &quot;to show off importance and wealth,&quot; hecomplained. . . . A council formed by President Lech Walesato battle anti-Semitism met for the first time and declaredthat the new, democratic Poland must be cured of all &quot;racismand xenophobia.&quot; The panel includes Roman Catholic and Jewishleaders, and political and academic representatives.</TEXT></DOC>
