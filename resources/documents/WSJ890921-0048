The M-CSF patent covers DNA sequences and engineered cells. Another U.S. patent covering the manufacturing process itself is expected &quot;shortly,&quot; the company said. The Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern said it currently is testing M-CSF in clinical trials in cancer patients and in bone marrow transplant recipients.    The Factor VIII patent also covers recombinant DNA methods for manufacture of the variants. &quot;If proven safe and effective,&quot; the modified proteins &quot;could offer a less expensive product for hemophilia treatment,&quot; Genetics Institute said. </TEXT></DOC>
