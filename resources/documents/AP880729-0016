So Jackson is backing off, saying ``no meeting has been set andno meeting has been sought'' for him to negotiate with Iranianofficials.   The best chance for the hostages remains recognition by Tehranthat their confinement by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon is ahumanitarian issue and not a card to play in foreign policymaneuvers.   Jackson was quoted as saying on Wednesday that he was trying toreach the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, through``third parties'' including Arab diplomats.   ``I have continuously expressed my interest in doing whatever Icould to make a humanitarian appeal to gain release of theAmericans held hostage,'' he told The New York Times.``Humanitarian appeals always help. They penetrate deeper thanpolitical tradeoffs.''   Jackson had made the freeing of the hostages a theme in hisunsuccessful pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination.Like a number of his proposals, it has a sweet and simple ring toit.   In January 1984, Jackson negotiated the release of Lt. Robert O.Goodman Jr., a Navy airman who had been shot down by Syrian forcesin Lebanon. It was widely seen as an attempt by President HafezAssad, whose government is listed by the State Department as asupporter of terrorism, to boost Jackson's political stock.   In June 1984, possibly with similar intentions, Cuba worked outarrangements with Jackson in Havana for the release of 48 Americanand Cuban political prisoners.   Despite this winning record, Jackson was publicly discouraged bythe State Department from trying his hand at personal diplomacy inbehalf of the hostages in Lebanon.   ``Reverend Jackson's sentiments concerning the hostages arethose shared by all Americans,'' spokesman Charles E. Redman saidThursday. ``But as for efforts to release the hostages, we believethat official channels offer the best chance of success.''   Redman said he meant working through the U.S. government.   James B. Steinberg, deputy issues director in the presidentialcampaign of Michael Dukakis, also voiced qualified disapproval.``We do not know any of the facts about this matter. As a matter ofgeneral policy, Gov. Dukakis has said that he does not favorprivate citizens independently conducting foreign policy.''   Kitty Dukakis, the Democratic candidate's wife, said her husbandwould not sanction any attempt by Jackson to negotiate for thehostages' release. ``My husband feels very strongly thatindividuals can't negotiate, but governments negotiate with eachother,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. ``And he would discourage Jesse Jacksonfrom going to Iran and trying to do that.''   Vice President George Bush, who will receive the Republicannomination next month in New Orleans, was more critical ofJackson's personal diplomacy. ``It shouldn't happen,'' he said.``We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. Theadministration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at theUnited Nations. We don't need any loose cannons rolling around thedeck.''   The remark stung. Jackson criticized Bush on Thursday fordescribing him as a ``loose cannon.'' But he also appeared to backaway from the idea of interceding with the Iranians.   ``No meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought,''Jackson told The Associated Press. ``We've simply talked through(United Nations) Secretary-General (Javier Perez) de Cuellar, whodid meet with the Iranian foreign minister.''   Traditionally, private citizens are discouraged from conductingU.S. foreign policy. There is even a law against it.   In the case of Iran, the situation is particularly delicate.   The Reagan administration was embarrassed when it tried to gainfreedom for the hostages by secretly selling missiles to Iran.   The State Department, which did not support the fiasco, isengaged in a careful campaign of messages and public statementsdesigned to draw Iran into a direct discussion of the Persian Gulfwar, the hostages and terrorism.   So far, there has been no ``authorized'' response from Tehran.   ``They know where to get hold of us,'' Redman said.   An offer on Tuesday by Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, thespeaker of Iran's parliament, to help obtain the release of theAmerican captives if the United States returned frozen assets wasturned down.   ``No deals,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,promptly retorted.   If Iran agrees to talk with the United States the hostages willbe high on the agenda. But the Reagan administration does not wantto appear to be making another deal with Tehran.   In the meantime, it is seeking release of the hostages through aseparate diplomatic track.   When it comes to Iran and to the hostages, a badly burned Reaganadministration prefers proceeding with extreme caution.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid covers diplomacy for The AssociatedPress from the State Department.</TEXT></DOC>
