The ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C.9604(i)) requires ATSDR to conduct health assessments for all sites onor proposed for inclusion on the National Priorities List, as establishedby the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, CERCLA authorizesATSDR to perform health assessments in response to requests from the publicand to conduct various types of health effects studies of releases of hazardoussubstances. This notice proposes regulations under which ATSDR will conducthealth assessments and related health effects studies. Also included inthe proposed regulation are procedures for persons to request ATSDR toconduct health assessments, as well as rules pertaining to the developmentof administrative records for ATSDR health assessments and health effectsstudies and cost recovery accounting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date: </T2>Comments must be received on or before October 24, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>Written comments in response to this notice should bearthe docket control number ATSDR-5, and should be submitted to: Georgi Jones,Director, Office of External Affairs, Agency for Toxic Substances and DiseaseRegistry, Chamblee 28 South, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30333,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>The Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (SARA) (Pub. L. 99-499) became effective on October 17, 1986. Thislaw, which extends and amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), greatly expanded the responsibilities and mandates ofthe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). ATSDR wasoriginally created by section 104(i) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)) andis responsible for conducting various types of research and other activitiesrelated to the health effects of hazardous substances. Section 110 of SARAamended Section 104(i) of CERCLA to authorize the Administrator of ATSDRto conduct a wide range of health-related activities pertaining to therelease of hazardous substances.Among other things, section 14(i) of CERCLA now requires that the Administratorof ATSDR:1. Conduct a health assessment by December 10, 1988 of all sites on orproposed for inclusion on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) NationalPriorities List (NPL) as of October 17, 1986;2. Conduct a health assessment of all sites newly proposed for inclusionon the NPL within one year of being proposed for inclusion;3. Respond to requests by interested persons to conduct a health assessmentwhere individuals have been exposed to a hazardous substances where theprobable source of the exposure is a release, as defined in CERCLA; and4. Where appropriate, conduct a wide variety of health effects studiesto determine whether there exists a risk to human health as a result ofexposure to hazardous substances.The primary purpose of this proposed regulation is to set forth generalprocedures which ATSDR will follow in determining when and how to conducthealth assessments and related health effects studies. In addition to CERCLAauthorized health assessments and health effects studies, this regulationalso applies to ATSDR health assessment activity under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6939a(c)). RCRA authorizes ATSDR toconduct a health assessment, at the request of EPA or a State with an authorizedState program, at a landfill or surface impoundment covered by the Act.RCRA also allows members of the public to submit to ATSDR evidence of releasesof or exposure to hazardous substances from such RCRA facilities.This proposal also contains provisions pertaining to the establishmentof administrative records for ATSDR health assessments and health effectsstudies, for tracking costs of these studies for cost recovery purposes,and for safeguarding trade secret and other confidential information.This proposed regulation is not intended to provide a detailed scientificstatement of the many factors ATSDR will consider when conducting a healthassessment. ATSDR will issue a general policy document which will discussin detail internal ATSDR procedures for conducting these assessments andthe scientific factors to be reviewed by the agency. The regulation nowproposed is to establish a general procedural framework for the conductof health assessments and related ATSDR health effects studies. When finalized,this regulation will expand upon and replace an earlier ATSDR policy statement``Interim Procedures for Requesting Health Assessments'' which was publishedin 52 FR 45,018 (November 24, 1987).The proposed regulation specifically defines ``health assessment'' and``health effects study.'' A ``health assessment'' is the evaluation ofdata and information on the release of hazardous substances into the environmentin order to: assess any current or future impact on public health, develophealth advisories or other recommendations, and identify studies or actionsneeded to evaluate and mitigate or prevent human health effects. A healthassessment often relies, in whole or in part, upon data provided to ATSDRby EPA, although other parties will be permitted to submit relevant datato ATSDR for consideration. Under some circumstances when complete environmentalor other data are lacking or are incomplete, ATSDR may determine that itwill be necessary to conduct further health assessment for a site or facilityas the data become available.A major purpose of a health assessment is to determine the need for healtheffects studies at a site to assess further any current or future risksto public health. A health assessment, therefore, can be viewed as thefirst formal level of ATSDR public health review at any site where thereis a release of hazardous substances. The results of a health assessmentare critical to any determination of a need to conduct further, more extensivehealth effects studies at a particular site. ATSDR health assessments willbe based upon factors such as the nature, concentration, toxicity, andextent of contamination at a site, the existence of potential pathwaysfor human exposure, the size and nature of the community likely to be exposed,and any other information available to ATSDR which is relevant to a determinationof potential risks to public health.Based upon the findings of a health assessment, ATSDR may determine itnecessary to conduct more comprehensive health effects studies at a site.``Health effects studies'' are research, investigations, or studies performedby ATSDR to evaluate health effects of hazardous substances at specificsites. Examplies of health effects studies include epidemiological studies,disease and exposure registries, and health surveillance programs. Normallyhealth effects studies will be largely based upon data gathered directlyby ATSDR or its agents specifically for study purposes. ATSDR will, however,consider data submitted by other parties, such as EPA, State and localhealth departments, and private entities when conducting health assessmentsand any health effects studies.ATSDR may issue a public health advisory based on the findings of a healthassessment, health effects study or other ATSDR involvement. The publichealth advisory is a statement containing a finding that a release posesa significant risk to human health and recommending measures to be takento reduce exposure and eliminate or substantially mitigate the significantrisk to human health.The proposed regulation establishes a procedure for interested personsto request that ATSDR conduct a health assessment at specific facilitiesand releases. ATSDR does not intend to adopt a restrictive interpretationof this statutory provision by limiting the type of entity which can makesuch a request. It is ATSDR's intention to consider all requests for healthassessments on their merits. The proposal specifies the minimum informationrequired to be contained in a request for a health assessment as well asindicating what other type of information would be useful to ATSDR in decidingwhether to conduct a health assessment.When otherwise not required to conduct a health assessment, ATSDR willconduct a health assessment when there is a reasonable basis for such anaction. In making such a discretionary determination, ATSDR will considerfactors such as whether individuals have been exposed to hazardous substances,the location, concentration, and toxicity of the hazardous substances,the potential for further human exposure, the recommendations of othergovernmental agencies, and other ATSDR priorities. While ATSDR is not requiredto conduct a health assessment in response to such requests, the proposedregulation reaffirms the agency's responsibility under CERCLA to providea written explanation to the requestor if a health assessment is not conducted.ATSDR intends to work closely with EPA and States in coordinating and conductinghealth assessments and related health effects studies. The proposed regulation,for instance, specifies that EPA and applicable State agencies will benotified of all requests for health assessments received from interestedpersons as well as the results of all ATSDR health effects studies. Inmost cases, much of the data relied upon by ATSDR in conducting healthassessments will have been gathered by EPA through its preliminary assessments,site investigations, or remedial investigations. However, ATSDR recognizesthat other parties, such as State and local government agencies, as wellas private groups and individuals, may have pertinent information relatedto specific sites. The proposed regulation states that ATSDR will notify specific parties,such as government agencies and certain private parties, of its intentionto conduct a health assessment. For instance, ATSDR will routinely notifythe owner or operator of a facility if that information is readily available.ATSDR does not intend to conduct extensive searches for owners or operatorsof facilities unless that information is available from such sources asEPA, State or local agencies, or site inspections. Accordingly, it is likelythat in the case of an abandoned site, few if any private potentially responsibleparties would be notified of ATSDR's intention to conduct a health assessment.One purpose of the notification of various parties is to gather as muchrelevant information as possible concerning a site of concern. In situationswhere little or no data are available for a specific site which is to bethe subject of a health assessment, ATSDR retains the right under the proposedregulation to arrange for sampling or other data gathering at a facilityor release for the limited purpose of determining the existence of currentor potential health problems.The proposal specifies that the administrative record for an ATSDR healthassessment and health effects study shall include, at a minimum, the finalreport of the assessment or study, nonconfidential data upon which thereport is based, the protocol for the study, the list of external peerreviewers of the study, their comments, and ATSDR's response to the comments.The proposed regulation also permits ATSDR to include in its administrativerecord any other documents which are determined to be appropriate. Theseprovisions are not intended to be a substitute for or conflict with administrativerecord requirements established by EPA for specific Superfund sites. EPAretains the authority to establish its own administrative records, althoughit is likely that EPA will include ATSDR's administrative record for itshealth assessments and health effects studies in the EPA administrativerecord for specific sites. In addition, interested parties may commentdirectly to EPA concerning ATSDR health assessments and health effectsstudies. EPA may, at its discretion, include these comments in its administrativerecord for each specific site.In amending CERCLA, SARA makes it clear that the costs of ATSDR healthassessments and health effects studies are response costs which are recoverablefrom responsible parties. The proposed regulation specifies that ATSDRwill compile documentation to support cost recovery actions for its studies.Where appropriate, this documentation will be forwarded to the appropriateEPA regional office for cost recovery purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act:</ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in this notice of proposedrulemaking have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget undersection 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and assigned a controlnumber as follows: section 90.4_OMB control number 0920-0204.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost Regulatory Analysis:</ITAG>The Secretary has determined, in accordance with Executive Order 12291,that this rule will not constitute a ``major'' rule and therefore is notsubject to the regulatory impact analysis requirements of the Order.
