While Virgin is well-established in its home market, it faces entrenched giants in the U.S., including MCA Inc., Warner Communications Inc., Bertelsmann A.G. of West Germany and Sony Corp.'s CBS Records unit -- all of which wield clout with retailers and the publicity mill.    Virgin began its push into the U.S. early last year, when it set up a unit in Los Angeles that has feverishly recruited staff and talent from scratch, hiring executives at high salaries and using extra-fat advances to woo artists like Mr. Winwood.    The company says Mr. Winwood's new album will help boost U.S. record revenue to $16 million in the fourth quarter ending July 31, twice that of the previous quarter. The album's first single, which is also called &quot;Roll With It,&quot; is already No. 29 and climbing in current U.S. charts compiled by Billboard magazine.    Virgin expects the U.S. unit to break even in its third year of operation, meaning sometime next year. Eventually, Virgin hopes to gain about 8% of the world market of roughly $15 billion annually, compared with about 4% currently.    &quot;The whole thing is taking off well,&quot; says Don Cruickshank, managing director of Virgin, which also wants to expand its video distribution business in the U.S.    Gaining a foothold in the U.S., however, could be very costly. Virgin refuses to comment on speculation that it advanced Mr. Winwood $7 million to jump to its label, but &quot;he's worth at least $7 million,&quot; says Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. A U.S. record executive, who doesn't want to be identified, says Virgin has entered the market &quot;in a very expensive way, and I believe this will come to haunt them.&quot;    Investors have their doubts, too. Mr. Branson sold a stake in Virgin on London's stock market in 1986, raising #28.5 million ($50.8 million). The stock has traded recently as low as 90 pence ($1.61), well below the 140 pence offering.    Virgin concedes the move will be costly. Its profit report for the six months ended Jan. 31 came with a warning that the cost of the U.S. push -- which hasn't been specified -- would keep fiscal 1988 profit below that of fiscal 1987. In the six-month period, profit before interest and tax in the music business, #11.5 million, was flat because of the push. In fiscal 1987, Virgin had net of #16.1 million, including a one-time gain of #4.6 million, on sales of #299.7 million.    Virgin argues the temporary softness is a small price to pay. In the long term, Virgin says, it can't afford not to be in the U.S. Virgin used to license its recording stars to U.S. companies, while retaining rights in the rest of the world. That worked fine with unknown artists whom Virgin had discovered in the U.K. But major artists want to deal with one world-wide company, Virgin executives say.    Besides, tastes and crazes in the U.S. and the U.K. feed off each other in unpredictable ways, so it helps to be tuned in to both markets. Britain, at least as important a source of new talent as the U.S., carries world influence far out of proportion to its size. But Britain sometimes follows U.S. tastes, too.    In the U.K., Mr. Branson and Virgin are well-known in the music business. As a teen-ager 18 years ago, Mr. Branson began Virgin as a mail-order record business. It has since become one of the four largest U.K. labels, with pop stars like Peter Gabriel and Boy George. Virgin also has interests in TV, publishing and retailing.    Mr. Branson, a bearded 37-year-old with longish hair who runs the company from a houseboat moored in a London canal, is a star himself, staging stunts like a transatlantic balloon flight last year that ended with an emergency landing off Ireland. A new ad on British TV features him touting his closely held Virgin Atlantic Airways.    The confident and laid-back corporate tone set from Mr. Branson's houseboat may unsettle staid money managers, but it apparently appeals to musicians. The company claims to have never lost a major artist, and Mr. Branson says he recently went skiing with two big stars, Mr. Gabriel and Bryan Ferry. &quot;Our artists never even talk to other record companies,&quot; Mr. Branson says. </TEXT></DOC>
