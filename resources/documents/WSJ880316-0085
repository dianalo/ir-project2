Peter Rodino of New Jersey announced his retirement this week after 40 years of service, 15 of them as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Although Mr. Rodino was nothing if not a partisan Democrat he placed an old-fashioned premium on fairness. His handling of the Nixon impeachment hearings contrasted favorably with the outrages of the Iran-Contra hearings. When some committee Democrats recently wanted to use an appearance by Attorney General Ed Meese solely to rail against an administration &quot;ethics gap,&quot; Mr. Rodino canceled the session. Moreover, he is one of the few Democrats who think independent counsels should be appointed to investigate Congress as well as the executive branch. We hope his successor is capable of the same independence, but we're prepared to be disappointed. </TEXT></DOC>
