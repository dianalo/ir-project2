Officials charged the United States was overstepping itsboundaries by adding its own penalties to those already taken byJapan.   The government hinted it might bring the matter before theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the measure becomes law.   ``The United States is seeking to unilaterally impose its ownpenalties in disregard of the independence of other countries,''Trade Minister Hajime Tamura said in a statement to reporters.``This is extremely regrettable.''   Toshiba Corp. President Joichi Aoi expressed regret, saying hiscompany had been unaware of Toshiba Machine Co.'s illegal sale tothe Soviets. He urged U.S. lawmakers to reconsider.   Congressional negotiators reached tentative agreement Thursdaynight on a sweeping trade bill designed to open foreign markets.The measure would ban U.S. government purchases of Toshibaequipment for three years and bar the import Toshiba Machine Co.products for the same period.   Kyodo News Service said Toshiba Corp. escaped the worst possiblescenario in which it stood to lose its entire U.S. export marketworth $2 billion a year. It said Toshiba Machine Co. faces the lossof $136 million a year.   The Reagan administration has threatened to veto the billbecause of the Toshiba provisions and other measures.   The Japanese government determined last spring that ToshibaMachine Co. sold to the Soviets sophisticated machinery capable ofsilencing submarine propellers. The sales violated Japan's ownexport laws and those of COCOM, the Western body that monitors suchsales to Communist nations.   The U.S. congressional agreement ``runs counter to a basicprinciple of COCOM that effective enforcement of export controls isentrusted to each participating country's autonomousresponsibility,'' Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said in a separatestatement.   He said the bill would, ``if adopted and implemented, violatethe GATT provisions, which the Government of Japan cannotoverlook.''</TEXT></DOC>
