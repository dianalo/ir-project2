US sensitivity was 92.3% in diagnosinghidronephrosis and 75% in detecting calculi. Small calculi were correctlyidentified, irrespective of their chemical composition. It must be stressedhow US, as compared to ivp, proved unsatisfactory in such cases as difficultvisualization of the middle portion of the ureter, unsuccessful identificationof acute obstruction without hydronephrosis (altough the patient's hydratationmay be useful in this respect), poor functional information (althoughthere was a correlation between renal hyperechogenicity and obstructivenephrogram). US is safe and easy to perform, and is suggested for theinitial evaluation of patients with renal colic, together with PF, andas an alternative to ivp. Moreover, US is the ideal technique in thefollow-up of these patients. Therefore, ivp should be performed in caseof differing clinical and sonographic findings, when the calculus isnot ejected within the expected time and when surgery or litotripsy areforeseen.</TEXT></DOC>
