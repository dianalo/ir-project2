He suggested a cutback was probable, saying he did not ``want tosignal anything in advance,'' but made it clear that no U.S. troopswill be withdrawn without the endorsement of NATO leaders at thesummit that begins Monday in Brussels.   Bush told Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita that, in concert withthe NATO allies, he intends to seize on the ``openings'' offered bySoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for arms reductions,Fitzwater said.   The pope, meanwhile, praised Bush for his stand againstnarcotics, calling drug use ``a moral crisis.'' Bush said hebenefited from John Paul II's ``wise counsel.''   The president also said he shares the Vatican's concern forworld peace. ``We've made progress in reducing armaments,'' Bushsaid.   Later, at a state dinner with De Mita, Bush announced thatItalians soon will be able to visit the United States withoutobtaining visas, joining Britain and Japan in a U.S. program givingeasier entry privileges to residents of selected countries.   Among the guests who shook hands with Bush at the glitteringdinner was Italian Communist Party head Achille Occhetto. Butelsewhere, leftist demonstrators clashed with riot police inprotest of the Bush visit. Three police and a woman bystander wereinjured, and 18 demonstrators were detained for questioning.   On Monday in Brussels, the president will meet with the leadersof the 15 U.S. allies in NATO.   Many of them are eager to have the United States match a seriesof weapons reductions pledged by Gorbachev. Fitzwater said thelatest Soviet moves, which include a willingness to impose limitson Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, presented ``some opportunities,and those are openings that need to be discussed with the alliesand will be.''   The White House spokesman, in a subtle policy shift, said theUnited States was now willing to negotiate over troop levels in theEast-West talks being held in Vienna.   Until now, the NATO allies have tried to concentrate the talkson tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. The Soviets, onthe other hand, have insisted on dealing directly with the levelsof NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.   Fitzwater, responding to Gorbachev's acceptance of equalceilings in the two alliances, said ``it's a matter fordiscussion.''   His comments Saturday came after reports that the United Stateswas considering a reduction in the 305,000 to 325,000 U.S. troopsin Europe.   Fitzwater took a similar tack in responding to questions aboutwhether the United States is preparing to lift economic sanctionsimposed on the Soviet Union in 1980 after the invasion ofAfghanistan.   ``The president will be discussing a variety of ideas, many ofthem never presented before,'' Fitzwater said.   Discussing U.S. forces, Fitzwater said flatly that ``The UnitedStates will not unilaterally withdraw troops from Europe.''   John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in aninterview to be telecast Sunday by Cable News Network that ``You'renot going to see unilateral action taken by one country or another.It will be an alliance action.''   A senior U.S. official said, meanwhile, that any action would betaken as part of the Conventional Forces in Europe, or CFE, talksin Vienna.   Any suggestion of a U.S. troop withdrawal is bound to have animpact on the allies as they consider a West German drive _ opposedby Bush _ for negotiations to reduce ground-based nuclear missilesin Europe.   On Saturday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned againstdelays in negotiating missile reductions, but British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher _ a strong supporter of the U.S.position _ argued that such cuts would be aimed at ``the jugular ofNATO.''   Italy is a strong supporter of the United States inside theWestern alliance on most defense issues. While Bush cannot count onthe Italians to side with him in opposing nuclear missilenegotiations with Moscow, his two-day stop reflects strong tieswith Rome.   Accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and BrentScowcroft, the national security adviser, Bush met with PrimeMinister De Mita at a 16th century hillside villa and then hadlunch with President Francesco Cossiga in a Wuirinale Palace hall.   He announced the liberalized U.S. entry rules for Italians at astate dinner with the prime minister, saying, ``In the future,Italians who wish to visit our country, whether as tourists or onbusiness, will no longer need to apply for visas, and we lookforward to that day.'' His announcement prompted warm applause atthe black-tie event.   He also held an unscheduled meeting with Bettino Craxi, theSocialist Party leader and prime minister from 1983 to 1987. Bush'saudience with the Pope later at the Vatican gave a colorful andphotogenic twist to his first day in Europe as president.   Bush met first with the pope in his library. The president'swife, Barbara, dressed in a black suit, and more than 30presidential aides joined them toward the end.   The pope praised Bush for his deep commitment ``to liberate theyouth of America from the destructive forces of drug abuse and toalleviate poverty at home and abroad.'' He said these problems were``only symptoms of a deeper moral crisis eating away at the verytexture of society in almost every part of the world.''   Bush, discussing efforts for world peace, assured the pontiff,``While we're still far from realizing the biblical injunction toturn our swords into plowshares, we've made progress in reducingarmaments and in decreasing the threat of war.''   Later, Bush told about 200 American seminarians studying here:``You remember the old American expression often said of a guru orindividual, `He hasn't got a prayer.' Well, I am delighted to meetan audience about whom that will never be said.''</TEXT></DOC>
