Hours earlier, Iran renewed an offer to help freeWestern hostages in Lebanon.   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,reported in a commentary late Sunday that Tehran was ``ready to useits maximum influence for the release of all hostages'' if theUnited States freed Iranian assets worth billions of dollars itfroze 10 years ago.   But Tehran Radio, also monitored in Cyprus, quoted Khameneitoday as saying no Iranian leader will negotiate with the UnitedStates.   ``Next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied Palestine, youare the most cursed government in the eyes of the Iranian people.No one in the Islamic republic will hold talks with you,'' theradio quoted Khamenei as telling U.S. leaders.   Khamenei has been seen as a so-called moderate in Iran,interested in restoring the country's ties with the West. Hiscomments underlined the divisions in Tehran over whether Iranshould help free the Western hostages in Lebanon.   ``In Lebanon, America commits the greatest atrocities andencourages its puppet Israel in kidnapping and hostage-taking,''Khamenei said, referring to Israel's abduction July 28 of SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman.   Khamenei did not specifically mention the Westerners heldhostage. Most are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists.   Khamenei was elected Iran's religious leader to succeedAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3. At that time, he wasclearly allied with Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, theleader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists who favor rebuildingbridges with the West.   Rafsanjani, who was elected Iran's president, has made clear inrecent days that dialogue with the United States on freeing thehostages is possible. He was behind the clandestinearms-for-hostages deal with the United States in 1985-86, duringwhich three American hostages were freed.   But Rafsanjani's radical rivals in Tehran, led by InteriorMinister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, have said they oppose any dealingswith the United States.   U.S. and Western intelligence officials have said Mohtashemi wasclosely linked with the formation of Hezbollah, the radical groupbelieved to be the umbrella for factions holding foreign hostages.   The IRNA commentary Sunday said the United States must pressureIsrael to free Obeid and secure the release of three Iraniansmissing in Lebanon since 1982 and all ``Lebanese captives held byIsrael.''   The Israelis said they kidnapped Obeid to arrange a swap withthree Israeli servicemen held in Lebanon. They later widened theoffer to include the release of Western hostages.   Hezbollah has ruled out any exchange of the Israeli prisonersuntil Obeid is released.   The Sunday Times of London reported Sunday that Israeliinvestigators who have questioned Obeid believe two of the Israelisoldiers are dead.   Israel's chief army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid, said herefuses to accept that.   ``My consideration is that they are alive and we must do ourutmost to bring them home,'' Lapid told a news conference Sunday.   `We consider our prisoners of war ... as living until positiveevidence proves the contrary,'' Lapid said.   The Sunday Times quoted unidentified senior Israeli governmentsources as saying Obeid's interrogators believe two Israeliinfantrymen, Yousef Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, died of wounds withinhours after their car was ambushed in south Lebanon in February1986.   The hostages in Lebanon include eight Americans. The hostageheld longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The IRNA commentary Sunday said ``the hostages are not held byIran'' but by ``unknown and underground groups.''   It said that ``the influence Iran has on these groups is merelyspiritual, which in certain cases in the past has provedeffective.''</TEXT></DOC>
