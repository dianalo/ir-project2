(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Here's a new class of software that promises to take the drudgery out offlowchart preparation.andP;  Users say t's about time.andM;A recent survey by International Data Corp. in Framinghain, Mass., has foundthat DOS users on average spend less than 10% of their day working withpresentation graphics programs.andP;  By contrast, users at surveyed corporationsspend as much as 90% of their work day using word processing, spreadsheet anddatabase software.andP;  PC graphics [software] is not and will not be used on aneveryday basis,&quot; says JoanCarol Brigham, an IDC software analyst.andM;Nevertheless, more specialized graphics packages that do one or two thingsextraordinarily well may succeed where generalized packages have failed.andP;  Onesuch category is a new class of software that's attracting attention amongusers tired of manually creating-and modifying flowcharts.andP;  These flowchartpackages enable users to quickly generate a large number of decision charts,organization charts and related business diagrams and then make swiftmodifications when new information becomes available.andM;Two Market ContendersandM;Two early entrants in the flowchart software market are Brookline, Mass.basedClear Software inc., fillmakers of DOS-based allCLEAR, and SanFrancisco-based RoyKore Inc., purveyors of ABC: Flowcharter, a MicrosoftWindows product.andP;  Both products allow users to construct flowcharts thatoutline ideas, procedures and policies much more easily than with pen andpaper.andP;  &quot;Anybody who deals with logistical information will be interested inall(:LEAR,&quot; says Vadim Yasinovsky, Clear Software's president.andM;According to RoyKore officials, ABC: Flowcharter has a similar appeal to awide range of business users, including financial auditors, consultants andsystems analysts.andP;  One user is Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.,andO;where the software is on the recommended buy list.andP;  &quot;A major part of ourbusiness is understanding the flows of paper, or internal controls andprocesses,&quot; says Russell Gates, partner with Arthur Andersen's AdvancedComputer Audit Techniques Group in Chicago.andP;  &quot;Our people use ABC .andP;  .  .toanalyze flows from an audit or internal control standpoint.&quot;andM;Before ABC, Flowcharter, Gates says, his biggest headache with flowchartsdrawn by hand or by less specialized when it was time to update them with newinformation.andP;  &quot;But that's not true with a Windows product like ABC:Flowcharter,&quot; says Gates, because of its ability to easily alter charts.andP;  ABCFlowcharter can change the size of flowchart elements and not onlyautomatically draw the lines that connect those elements but automaticallyredraw the lines if changes are made that alter the relationships between theelements.andM;The auditing services department of Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. in Raleigh,N.C., is another user of ABC.andP;  Flowcharter.andP;  According to Bill Harris, seniorauditor at the utility company, 33 people in his department using the productto document auditing processes.andP;  He says that a large part of the attractionis the ability to do large charts and connect multiple charts.andM;The fact that flowcharting software is attractive to a growing number ofusers hasn't been lost on suppliers of more generalized presentationpackages.andP;  Nor has it stopped users of Lotus Development Corp.'s Freelance,Micrografx Inc.'s Charisma, Microsoft Corp.'s PowerPoint or SoftwarePublishing Corp.'s Harvard Graphics form attempting to draw flowcharts withtheir existing software.andP;  However, users say, these packages are moredifficult to employ than those designed specifically for making flowcharts.andM;Software Publishing Corp. recently integrated Draw Partner, a flowchartingmodule into its top-sellin Harvar Graphics package.andP;  And version 2.3 ofHarvard Graphics now contains a library of 500 flowchart symbols.andP;  &quot;DrawPartner is an advanced drawing program, and users can certainly drawflowcharts with it,&quot; argues Dan Meub, director of marketing for SoftwarePublishiing's graphics division.andP;  &quot;It also has a zoom facility for doingdetailed work,&quot; he notes.andP;  But he admits that Draw Partner does notautomatically draw the lines that connect symbols and shapes, as do mostflowcharting packages.andP;  The company will address some of this capability in afuture Windows version.andM;Arthur Andersen's Gates, for one, says that he tried using presentationgraphics packages for flowcharting purposes.andP;  But problems arose when hisusers attempted to update charts with new information-an effort he likens tothe changes that were once required when the company drew charts with penciland paper.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
