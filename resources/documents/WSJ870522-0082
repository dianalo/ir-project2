Kelly is preparing to go on a multibillion-dollar corporate shopping spree.    Beatrice Cos.'s chairman and chief executive officer says he hopes to make an acquisition of at least $5 billion this year. &quot;Nine billion dollars doesn't scare me,&quot; he declares.    Since Chicago-based Beatrice was taken private last year in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Mr. Kelly has been a bit subdued. Rather than pursue his favorite activity of making acquisitions, he has been busy selling Beatrice assets at a fast pace in order to pay down more than $6 billion of debt. Sopping up red ink isn't his idea of excitement.    Now, Mr. Kelly, who built Esmark Inc. into a sprawling conglomerate in the 1970s and early 1980s, is yearning for a comeback as a master deal maker. He won't elaborate on prospective targets, saying only that food companies are top candidates.    Several food stocks, including General Mills Inc. and Pillsbury Co., are considered undervalued by securities analysts. While both companies are fiercely independent, they are well within Mr. Kelly's stated price range. &quot;You can't take Kelly lightly. He usually does what he sets out to do,&quot; says Stephen Carnes, an analyst at Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc.    On Wednesday, Beatrice filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of its remaining non-food businesses and some of its smaller specialty-food lines. The new company is named E-II Holdings Inc., as the reincarnation of Esmark, which Beatrice swallowed in 1984.    The E-II stock offering and two accompanying debt issues are expected to produce $1.2 billion in cash, which Mr. Kelly calls his acquisition war chest. Mr. Kelly, who is E-II's chairman and chief executive officer, plans to make acquisitions through leveraged buyouts, which are financed largely by debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales.    Mr. Kelly has confounded his doubters by getting premium prices for such Beatrice businesses as its International Playtex Inc. personal-products division and Avis Inc. car-rental unit in the past year. &quot;When that Irishman starts talking, whatever he's selling becomes the greatest thing since sliced bread,&quot; says Roger Spencer, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.    Responding for the first time to a report last October in this newspaper that he's preparing public offerings for all of Beatrice, he said that's a &quot;possibility.&quot; But he said he is &quot;concerned&quot; that the food businesses' earnings, which lag the industry's leading performers, could cool investor reaction to such a large offering. Beatrice's domestic lines, including Hunt's tomato products and Wesson cooking oils, had pre-tax profit of $448 million on sales of $4.82 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.    It's also possible that instead of going public, Beatrice's domestic food businesses will be sold to another food company. An industry source close to Beatrice says several companies have expressed interest in the food businesses. That source said that such a sale, if it occurs, would follow the E-II offering and the likely disposition of the international food lines.    Mr. Kelly's strategy is to essentially liquidate the Beatrice that Kohlberg Kravis bought. When that's done, he'll be free to concentrate on E-II, a conglomerate-to-be he can build from scratch. For E-II, he hopes for one or two &quot;smaller acquisitions . . . less than $500 million, in the immediate months ahead.&quot; Soon after, he plans to buy a much larger company. &quot;The margin for error is greater with the big companies. If one of its units turns out to be worth less (than is paid for it), you hope to discover that you have undervalued another one.&quot;    The 65-year-old native of Chicago's South Side has come a long way. After serving as a Navy torpedo-man in World War II, his first job was as a clerk at an insurance concern in 1946. In 1973, he became president of Esmark Inc., a holding company created to restructure Swift andamp; Co. He reshaped the company, spinning off its well-known meatpacking business.    He is paid well for his efforts. A recent Beatrice SEC filing shows that the company has paid $13 million into a trust for Mr. Kelly, and his salary last year was $1.3 million. &quot;I'm relatively cheap. It's like when Babe Ruth said he made more than the president of the United States because he had a better year,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
