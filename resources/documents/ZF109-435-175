Ronal &quot;Star&quot; Carey, program manager for the Reserve ComponentAutomation System, had a theory on why his background running raveyards madehim the right man for RCAS.andP;  He explained it during his first briefing ofArmy officials shortly after taking over the program in 1988.andM;&quot;I pointed out that anyone who had as much experience as I had talking topeople who didn't talk back was well qualified to go to the Pentagon and askfor money.&quot;andM;Carey was the deputy chief of the Army Reserve when he was nominated to bethe program manager of RCAS under four-year stint that will end a year fromnow.andM;Perhaps his sense of humor mitigated his lack of experience.andP;  After all, hewas the 18th man to take on the job of getting RCAS off the drawing board andinto 10,000 Guard and Army Reserve offices nationwide by the end of thecentury.andM;Unfuilfilled PromiseandM;During 10 years of Army control, the RCAS program had remained an unfulfilledconcept of how the wartime mobilization and peacetime administrative needs ofthe Guard and Reserve might be met through a vast network of hardware,software and communications system.andM;About $50 million allocated for the program was spent while officials of theArmy's active component often thwarted anything so extravagant as astate-of-the-art information system for their poor cousins in the reserves.andM;An exasperated House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, certain thatactive Army officials would forever use the reserve program as a source ofextra money for their own pet programs, finally shifted management of RCAS tothe Guard in 1987, requiring that a reserve officer run the program.andM;Carey holds a doctorate in marketing and took the RCAS job at a time whensalemanship was necessary.andM;Senior Army officials were fighting tooth and nail against the program andthe congressional edict.andM;A subcommittee report that preceded transfer of RCAS to the Guard accused theArmy of producing a functional dscription and draft request for proposals in1986 that &quot;wired&quot; RCAS for two incumbent Army contractors.andP;  That RFP waskilled on the Hill.andM;About a year after Carey took over, Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Bruce R. Harris, then theArmy's chief IRM official, led a new charge against a system for thatreserves.andM;HArris tried to persuade Michael P.W.andP;  Stone, then deputy secretary foracquisitions and now secretary of the Army, that Army-owned computersembodying a prior generation of technology could be handed down to thereserves at far less cost than buying new ones.andP;  Stone went on the recordendorsing the economic logic of Harris' argument.andM;At monthly vendors' conferences at Fort Belvoir, Va., Carey tactfullyreminded listeners that RCAS was a line item in the budget and would remainin the form the subcommittee continued to mandate; a state-of-the-artinformation system to be obtained through the Office of Management and BudgetCircular A-109 procurement process in which a vendor-proposed solution isimplemented.andM;At those conferences he often confronted a gaggle of industry officials whocollectively knew far more than he did about hardware, software andacquisition regulations.andP;  Many of them made it clear they doubted that RCAShad high-level support in the Pentagon.andM;CArey's position was at the very least precarious, if for no other reasonthan the fact that he reports through a chain of command that leads to theactive Army and Stone first before it reaches Congress.andM;Carey also had to deal with the press, the audit agencies, the GeneralServices Administration and a chorus of naysayers who though the past wasprologue for RCAS.andP;  A former Army official whome Carey interviewed for a keyslot in the management office recalled.andP;  &quot;The first thing I told him was,'Star, it'll never work.'&quot;andM;Besides the line-up of potential RCAS foes strategically situated inWashington, Carey also had to ward off the complaints of computer-starvedweekend soldiers at the thousands of Guard and reserve offices around thecountry.andP;  The subcommittee continues to block any attempt by reservists tobuild their own system before RCAS arrives.andM;35,000 PagesandM;Carey's first substantial task was to assemble and manage a staff that wouldupdate the functional description so that industry would know exactly whatthe reserves needed to automate.andP;  The enormity of the task was reflected inthe size of the finished document; 35,000 pages.andP;  It chronicles the entiremobilization and day-to-day business needs of about 1 million reservists.andM;&quot;It's much easier when you're using A-109 to get a battleship,&quot; Carey oncequipped, &quot;than to get an information system.andP;  For a battleship, you just tellindustry, 'Give me something that floats and looks scary.'&quot;andM;In January of this year, shortly after the description and a new RFP werereleased, Carey was honored with the Guard's legion of merit.andP;  At theceremony, Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  HerbertandM;R.andP;  Temple Jr., then the Guard chief, said Carey &quot; assumed control or RCASduring a period of great turmoil and low morale.&quot;andM;But Carey was forceful about meeting time lines and always &quot;articulated aclear and constant vision and direction for the program.&quot;andP;  Temple said.andO;Carey was able to produce the description and RFP, as weel as a comprehensiveeconomic analysis of the program's potential costs wile also convincing thePentagon and Congress to pay for it.andP;  He earned his honor, Temple said.andM;The man with no experience, in less than two years, had proved himself aformidable task-master for a once beleaguered program.andP;  He had brought itfarther than his predecessors had.andM;Carey is one of the few high-profile managers within a DOD culture of IRMofficials who, for the most part, don't want to be known at all.andP;  Certainly,an officer who took on the nickname &quot;Star&quot; when promoted from colonel toone-star brigadier general probably won't ever need to consult a publicrelations firms for tips on how to distinguish himself in the military.andM;But his public persona, he insists, extends no further than RCAS.andP;  Indeed,after making himself available to discuss RCAS for more than 15 months, herefused to be interviewed for this article because it would be about him, notthe program.andM;Private LifeandM;His official DOD biography reports that Carey was born in Texas in 1938 andbegan his military career as a private in a unit of the Ohio National Guardin 1956.andP;  His wife, Sandra Harley Carey, is a social psychologist and a Navyreserve commander.andM;In the 1960s Carey was a briefing officer in Vietnam.andP;  Among other things, helearned there that data integrity depends on whether those providinginformation believe those asking for it were seriously in need.andM;&quot;Otherwise, you end up basing information on data that is very precise andtotally inaccurate,&quot; he said during a recent address, describing a scenarioin which &quot;a supply officer asks for a number, and the clerk at the other endof the phone says, 'You need a number?andP;  Fine.andP;  How about 39?'&quot;andM;In the time he has managed RCAS, the program has met every milestone with aprecision that is almost eerie, given the way big-money DOD buys usually snagat every possible juncture.andP;  When RCAS kept its self-imposed deadline lastyear it did so in spite of mid-December rumors that GSA would withhold thedelegation of procurement authority because of unresolved FTS 2000 problemsand other significant issues.andM;Later, when asked how his program and its backers were able to turn GSAaround in two weeks, Carey said, &quot;We did it because we're RCAS.&quot;andM;Precision is implied in Carey's ramrod-straight demeanor, which is disarmingwhen worked in combination with his self-effacing sense of humor.andP;  A visitorto the RCAS program headquarters near Fort Belvoir got a glimpse of howquickly he can make the transition from steely Texan to Washington wise-guywhen commenting on the fact that his spacious office had no computer in it.andM;&quot;Automation?&quot;andP;  Carey asked sharply in return, playing the role of his ownstraight man before giving up the Gary Cooper-tight squint in his eye for themischievous punch line.andP;  &quot;There's no future for automation.&quot;andM;In fact, Carey describes himself as &quot;a people person,&quot; by which he meansanything you might want to know about RCAS that he doesn't can be provided byone of the 50 people on his staff.andP;  They have computers.andM;Keeping the FaithandM;Carey's willingness to defer to those of lower rank suggests faith indelegating authority.andP;  &quot;He trusts his people,&quot; one Army official said,&quot;because he made sure he went out and got believers.andP;  You don't say anythingnegative about RCAS and work for Star Carey, I can tell you that.&quot;andM;Indeed, if any single trait is common among the RCAS staff it is their fierceloyalty.andP;  Many of Carey's people do come from information systemsbackgrounds.andP;  When asked why RCAS has captured their loyalty as not otherprogram has, they invariably talk about the man at the top.andM;&quot;RCAS is the best program I've ever worked on because Gen.andP;  Carey is the bestPM I've ever worked for,&quot; said one supervisor in the program office.andO;Multiply that answer by 50 and you understand how Carey has turned theprogram around, many observers have said.andM;Carey returns to his staff a generous consideration of their needs -- in somecases, whether they want it or not.andP;  He has installed a mini HolidaySpa-style exercise room in the RCAS offices and &quot;encourages&quot; the staff to useit.andM;The boss's concern for the health of his people contains the conundrum of aJapanese corporation.andP;  The work week at RCAS often extends beyond 40 hours.andO;It reportedly was closer to 80 hours last year when the RFP deadline wasapproching and rumors abounded both within the DOD and on the outside thatRCAS would be delayed.andM;Carey runs the program from a recently built commercial office buildingleased through GSA.andP;  He designedc the interior space to include as executivearray of offices in which his own door, that of his chief of staff and deputyPM all face each other at an intimate meeting point for what he terms&quot;impromptu meetings.&quot;andM;The RCAS office itself has aroused some criticism, particularly amongofficials with offices at conventional DOD facilities or at military bases.andM;An IRM staffer with the Army Materiel Command in Alexandria returned from avisit to RCAS and grumbled.andP;  We can barely afford chairs and have to usebroker dividers and here's this guy with a gymnasium, imported carpets andall these other goodies.&quot;andM;Setting StandardandM;His relatively plush surroundings notwithstanding, Carey is Spartau in hisdevotion to RCAS.andP;  When he is not out of town visiting a reserve unit oraddressing an IRM conference, he always seems to be at work -- an assessmentbased on his tendency to return prhone calls at 7 a.m., 7 p.m.andP;  or anytime inbetween.andM;At a vendors conference he once told the assembled hopefuls that the chiefexecutive of the corporation that becomes the RCAS prime contractor will beexpected to provide his or her home telephone number Carey will use it.andM;&quot;RCAS will be the system that sets the standard for future informationsystems&quot; he once said.andP;  Though such a remark might seem like unabashed,unsupported bringing the mand who made it no longer can be called a noviceIRM manager.andM;In fact, Carey is probably as fluent now in the fundamentals of DOD systemsas any program manager on the job.andP;  When the corporate information management(CIM) initiative to merge like-DOD systems still was a glean in the eyes ofPentagon consolidators.andP;  Carey already had visited the managers anddevelopers of major Army, Navy and Air Force projects, learning how they doit and what he might export to RCAS.andM;One of the first graduates of GSA's Trail Boss program, Carey also is fluentin the realities of bureaucracy.andP;  Rather than wait for a phone call, Careycalled the Army audit agency and asked it to come in to review RCAS.andM;&quot;You know they're coming sooner or later,&quot; he explained, &quot;so why not just doit now and get it over with?&quot;andM;The idea that RCAS will set the standard for future systems certainly begsnot only a re-statement of the program's long history as a failure but alsoof the enormity of challenges that still might ambush it.andM;Certainly, even to begin listing the technical, administrative or politicalproblems that could undo RCAS is to risk amassing a document to rival theGuard's functional description.andM;But Star Carey brings more than knowledge to his defense of RCAS.andP;  He bringsnearly three years of new history to an old project.andP;  During that time he hasmet the schedule and stayed within the budget.andP;  He has warded off thoseforces that might have stopped the program wherever they have come from.andO;Tell him &quot;No.&quot; and he'll say &quot;Yes.&quot;andM;Ask him why, and he'll say, &quot;Because we're RCAS.andM;It used to be a thirty word.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
