Hamburger is pressed with spatula and juices leak out.;   Start with a good-quality lean ground beef, says Fraser, and make it biggerthan the hamburger bun to allow for shrinkage. Loosely pack the burgers formeat that's crisper outside, juicier inside. Place on a greased grill or in aburger basket over medium-hot coals or medium-high setting.;    Because of theamount of handling that goes into ground beef, food safety experts recommendcooking burgers to medium, or an internal temperature of 160 to 170 degrees.Fraser says cook four to five minutes or until browned, then turn and cookseven minutes more for medium.;    Chicken;  Common mistakes: Fire is too hot;chicken is turned too often; chicken is pricked constantly with a turning forkand juices run out; barbecue sauce is applied too early and burns.;    Chickenis one of the trickier meats to grill, admits Fraser, given that it'sfrequently undercooked or overcooked, i.e., burned. &quot;People get impatient forthe chicken to finish cooking and they try to hurry it along.&quot;;    The result:They stoke up the coals or turn up the heat to coax it. From a food safetypoint of view, that's a problem because they end up with charred chicken onthe outside, raw chicken on the inside.;    One solution is to start thechicken in the microwave and finish it on the grill. The other is to make surethe chicken is cooked all the way through with no pink meat near the bone;juices should run clear when pricked (and don't keep poking at it to findout).;    Steaks;  Common mistakes: &quot;There can't be a problem with steaks, canthere? Even the cheapest, toughest steak you can marinate and do a wonderfuljob on the barbecue.&quot;;    Turn steaks with tongs, not fork. Slash the fattyedges to keep the meat from curling. When the little bubbles start to appearon top, turn.;    Cook a one-inch steak five to seven minutes per side forrare; seven to nine minutes per side for medium; nine to 11 minutes per sidefor well-done.;    Shrimp;  Common mistake: Overcooking.;    Shrimp need onlya couple minutes on either side. For grilling purposes, the bigger the better.Keep the shrimp in the shell, if possible, to keep the juices in, and letpeople peel their own.;    Fish;  Common mistake: Overcooking. The best fishfor grilling are the firmer fish, such as swordfish, monkfish and salmon. Ifusing the softer, thinner fish, a grilling basket is a necessity.;    Oil thegrill when cooking fish and use a marinade or baste frequently with butter oroil. Fish should be barbecued at high or over hot coals for 10 minutes perinch of thickness, measured at the fish's thickest point.;    Pork;  Commonmistakes: Overcooking; fire too hot.;    Pork should be cooked over low tomoderate heat. Fraser says hold your hand over the grill for four to sixseconds maximum.;    Lamb;  Common mistake: Overcooking.;    Lamb chops can bemarinated and cooked on a greased grill over medium hot coals or mediumsetting for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn only once.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARTY MEITUS, Scripps Howard News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910626  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  576  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 26, 199100178006,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
