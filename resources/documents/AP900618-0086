Whenmatches begin, rival Christian fighters lay down their guns, switchon their portable television sets and for a while, the country iscalm.   The only gunfire comes when excited militiamen shoot in the airin jubilation when their favorite soccer teams score.   When West Germany played Yugoslavia last week, a group ofscruffy militiamen from Samir Geagea's Christian militia gatheredaround a mobile anti-aircraft gun in east Beirut's Ashrafiyehdistrict. They watched the game on a portable TV propped up besidethe weapon.   A few yards away, their rivals _ the troops of Gen. Michel Aoun_ also watched the game, on a TV powered by a truck battery.   When West Germany's Lothar Matthaeus scored his second goal,both groups whooped for joy and fired off clips of bullets into theair.   The Germans' 4-1 victory triggered more celebratory gunfire.   It was easy to forget for a moment that Aoun's troops andGeagea's militiamen have been fighting since Jan. 30 in a savagestruggle for control of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.   ``The World Cup has been a godsend,'' said one man in eastBeirut. ``We really needed a diversion, even if it's only for amonth.   ``We know we'll be going back to the `salt mines' afterward,''he said, reflecting fears that a cease-fire between Aoun's troopsand Geagea's militiamen will collapse like others have.   The uneasy cease-fire reached last month is violated frequently.But when World Cup is on television, both sides are too engrossedto skirmish.   Across the devastated city, in the teeming Shiite Moslem slumsof south Beirut, it is the same. The Hezbollah and Amal movementshave been battling for three years for dominance of Lebanon'sShiites. But when the soccer matches begin in Italy each day,television sets in the Shiite battleground and across Lebanonswitch on, and the country's 15-year-old civil war eases for a fewhours.   Electricity in Beirut has been cut off since early Februarybecause the city's power plants were knocked out in the Aoun-Geageafighting, so everyone uses generators. The city hums. Theauthorities have allowed generators to run until midnight, or untilthe end of the last game, whichever comes first.   Just before the World Cup telecasts begin, the city of Beirutshuts down. The streets are virtually deserted. Shops areshuttered. People go home or congregate in bars to watch the gameson TV.   Entire streets, for reasons known only to their residents,support different teams. The choice is usually arbitrary.   Few Lebanese have particular links with any of the countriescompeting in Italy. Tiny Lebanon has not had a national soccer teamfor years, and when it did, it never got anywhere near qualifyingfor the World Cup.   But Lebanese, like most Arabs, are big on soccer.   At the American University of Beirut in the city's Moslemsector, the campus is festooned with the flags of the competingsoccer nations.   The night Egypt scored a surprise 1-1 tie with the Netherlands,Arab emotions erupted.   When the underdog Egyptians held Ireland to a scoreless drawSunday, militiamen let their guns rip with wild abandon.   Joyful AUB students ran through campus carrying burning torches,beating drums, waving Egyptian flags and lobbing plastic bagsfilled with water at by-standers.   ``I got at least 30 waterbags on my head when I tried to crossfrom the dorms to the classrooms,'' said one student.</TEXT></DOC>
