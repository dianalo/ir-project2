Supplementary Information:</ITAG>a. BackgroundThe Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products was established pursuantto Title III, Part B of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) (Pub.L. 94-163). Subsequently, EPCA was amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA) (Pub. L. 95-619), the National Appliance Energy ConservationAct of 1987 (NAECA) (Pub. L. 100-12) \1\<NOTE/> and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendmentsof 1988 (NAECA-1988) (Pub. L. 100-357). Among other program elements, section323 of the Act requires that standard methods of testing be prescribedfor covered products, including refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, andfreezers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA as amended by NECPA, NAECAand NAECA-1988 is referred to in this notice as the ``Act''.The Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) proposed test proceduresfor refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, and freezers by notice issuedApril 21, 1977. (42 FR 21576, April 27, 1977). A public hearing on theproposed test procedures was held on June 14, 1977. The Department issuedfinal test procedures on September 8, 1977. (42 FR 46140, September 14,1977).On July 14, 1980, DOE published a response to a petition for rulemakingsubmitted by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), requestingthat the burden of test procedures for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers be lessened.The response included the comments of the National Bureau of Standards(NBS), the AHAM recommendations, and DOE's proposed revised test procedures.(45 FR 47396, July 14, 1980). On October 14, 1981, DOE proposed an amendedversion of the revised test procedures (46 FR 50544) which defined steady-stateconditions and requirements for the test chamber ambient air temperaturegradient. The final rule establishing new test procedures for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers and freezers, was published on August 10, 1982. (47FR 34517). Editorial corrections to the final rule were published March29, 1983. (48 FR 13013). The August 1982 final rule established a three-yeartransition period, expiring on September 9, 1985, for the new test procedures.Subsequently, DOE received four petitions for waivers concerning electronicadaptive defrost controls (ADC). The first petition (Case No. RF-001),received from Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) on November 14, 1984, waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 11, 1985. (50 FR 1628). Based on DOE'sreview of comments and data provided, DOE determined that the test procedureshad no provision for determining the interval between defrost cycles forADC-equipped refrigerator-freezers which would be comparable to normalusage patterns. Based on DOE's review of Whirlpool's field data and commentsfrom two other manufacturers, DOE developed an alternative test methodwhich was included in the Decision and Order granted Whirlpool on August23, 1985. (50 FR 34186).The second Petition for Waiver (Case No. RF-002) received from White ConsolidatedIndustries (WCI) on October 23, 1985, was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 16, 1985. (50 FR 51284). WCI alsohad developed an electronic defrost control system (EDC) and requestedpermission to use the test procedures granted previously to Whirlpool.Based on DOE's review of comments and the Petition for Waiver, DOE developedan alternate test method based on the long-time automatic defrost testin Appendix A1 of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 430, which was included in theDecision and Order granted WCI. (51 FR 15679, April 26, 1986).On March 12, 1986, Whirlpool submitted Petitions for Waiver of DOE testprocedure requirements for two new ADC-equipped refrigerator-freezers (CaseNos. RF-003 and RF-004). Both petitions were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 21, 1986. (51 FR 18655). In each petition,Whirlpool requested to use the alternate test procedure granted in CaseNo. RF-001. Based upon DOE's review of the petitions and the comments received,the Department granted each petition, allowing Whirlpool to use the sametest procedure specified in the DOE's Decision and Order in Case No. RF-001.(51 FR 36591, October 14, 1986).Following an analysis of the two defrost control systems and a review ofpast comments and data, DOE is proposing a test procedure for variabledefrost control (VDC) equipped refrigerator-freezers and freezers basedon the long-time automatic defrost test in Appendices A1 and B1 to SubpartB to eliminate the need for the outstanding waivers.DOE is also proposing to establish test procedures for refrigerator-freezerswith dual compressor systems and procedures for freezers with a rapid freezingfeature.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion:</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking presents the various developments in the manufactureof refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers which have occurredsince the August 10, 1982, final rule.a. Variable Defrost ControlFour petitions for waivers have been granted for refrigerator-freezersequipped with a variable defrost control system. Three were given to theWhirlpool Corporation and one to White Consolidated Industries. Variabledefrost control systems are identified differently by each manufacturer,for example, as an adaptive defrost control system (ADC) by Whirlpool,and as an electronic defrost control (EDC) by WCI. DOE is proposing thatthe term ``variable defrost control'' (VDC) include these two defrost systemsas well as any future products which have electronic or mechanical deviceswhich can change the interval between defrosts by evaluating the operatingcharacteristics and the compressor run time of the product, including demanddefrost.The defrost mechanism on a typical automatic defrost refrigerator-freezeris operated by a timer which counts compressor on-time. The defrost cyclebegins after a set compressor on-time, typically 12 hours. The VDC systemrelies on various inputs, in addition to compressor on time to determinethe time between defrost cycles. These inputs could be the number of dooropenings for refrigerator or freezer compartments, air flow rate acrosscoils, defrost time for previous defrost, outside temperature, etc. Sinceeach manufacturer is likely to take a unique approach to these characteristics,DOE today is proposing a method of testing that can be used by all manufacturersfor rating those refrigerator-freezers and freezers with a variable defrostsystem.The petitions for waivers identified three problem areas in the existingtest procedure. The first is the inability of the current test procedureto determine the interval between defrost cycles for VDC equipment thatwould be comparable to normal usage patterns. Second is the low humidityconditions normally encountered within the test chamber and the lack ofrefrigerator and freezer compartment door openings. Third, the time periodbetween defrost cycles would become excessively longer than that whichwould be expected under normal usage conditions. This lengthening of theperiod between defrost cycles increases the duration of the test such thatthe test is unduly burdensome to conduct. Information contained in Whirlpool'spetitions for waiver for its ADC device show that door opening frequencyand duration are heavily weighted factors in determining the time betweendefrost periods.DOE began its development of a VDC test procedure by reviewing the waiversissued and consulting NBS in evaluating data and alternate test procedures.NBS prepared comments analyzing the two methods used in the waivers andoffered alternatives for the new test procedure. Concurrent with the NBSevaluation of VDC test procedures, AHAM provided DOE a copy of ``RecommendedTest Procedure for Determining The Energy Consumption for Adaptive DefrostRefrigerator-Freezers and Freezers.'' DOE evaluated the AHAM test procedureand is including it in today's proposal as an optional test procedure.As discussed below, DOE believes the AHAM proposed test procedure, a testprocedure based on door openings, is a burdensome test method and therefore,not justified as a requirement for testing all VDC-equipped units.The primary issue in the determination of an appropriate VDC test procedureis the typical time between defrost cycles. In the review of the petitionsfor waiver, NBS concluded that the time between defrost cycles could beas much as three days (72 hours). This would credit VDC-equipped unitswith 80 to 90 percent of the maximum energy reduction possible. Furtheranalysis of this issue has led to an NBS study of variable defrost controland the impact of compressor run time for rating refrigerator-freezers.\2\<NOTE/> The study presents an analytical method of determining thevariables in the rating procedure. DOE contacted Whirlpool Corporationin an effort to gather test data for this proceeding. However, Whirlpoolhad no available data other than that provided in Case No. RF-001. TheWhirlpool data suggested that with limited door openings, ADC units couldrun for six days before defrosting.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Energy Rating of Refrigerators with Variable DefrostControls'' Bal Mahajan PH.D., P.E., National Bureau of Standards, May 7,1987.The Department's analysis of all available information has identified theratio of compressor on-time (CT) to total on-time as typically 50 percent.This implies that an automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer equipped witha 12-hour timer on the compressor should perform one defrost cycle every24 hours, or once a day. The compressor on-time for VDC models is onlyone factor used in the control algorithm \3\<NOTE/> to determine the time between defrost cycles. Other factorsevaluated in the algorithm include door openings, previous defrost duration,frost build-up, and consumer usage factors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Algorithm_A mathematical rule or procedure for solvinga problem.The value of CT calculated using the NBS recommended approach can differfrom the value measured in the field due to variations in consumer behavior.The manufacturer establishes the degree of importance assigned to the factorsthat determine defrost time. The duration between defrost cycles and thevalue of CT are affected by how the manufacturer's algorithm views theconsumer usage pattern. Since the consumer usage pattern is an uncontrollablevariable, even for a standard size family, the only controllable elementis the manufacturer's input to the algorithm. Therefore, DOE determinedthat the input values selected by the manufacturer should have boundaries.Since the compressor on-time (CT) between defrosts does not reach infinityand is not zero for VDC-equipped models, the value CT is bounded by a minimumor least time (CTL) and a maximum time (CTM).\4\<NOTE/> These values are specified by the manufacturer and includedin the VDC algorithm. NBS evaluated the effect CT had on the per day energyconsumption. As part of this evaluation, a frequency factor (F) was createdto express the ratios between CT, CTL, and CTM. NBS determined that thevalue CT had significant effect on per day energy consumption when defrostcycles are spaced 6 to 12 hours apart and a lesser effect as the time betweendefrosts reached 72 hours of compressor on-time. Based on NBS's evaluationof various defrost cycles, DOE proposes that a value of 0.2 for F be representativeof VDC-equipped units. Assuming a value of 0.2 for F, allows CT, and thenenery use, to be calculated.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A value of infinity would mean tha the unit never defrostswhile zero would result in the unit constantly defrosting.The Decisions and Orders issued to Whirlpool (Cases No. RF-003, RF-004)and WCI (Case No. FR-002) did not assign a value for F to be used in thelong-time automatic defrost equation. Rather, the value of CT was assignedbased on NBS's review of each Petition for Waiver. Whirlpool was assigneda value of 36 hours for CT and WCI assigned 12 hours. Because CT variesby design based on the manufacturers' VDC algorithms, DOE examined alternativesto prescribing CT which would allow VDC-equipped models to be individuallyevaluated. NBS recommended setting a value of F based on the ratio of CTLand CTM. Based on its review of the petitions for waiver, NBS recommendedboundaries for the values of CTL and CTM in the manufacturers' VDC algorithms.These boundaries are set at a minimum or CTL of 12 hours and a maximumor CTM of 84 hours.AHMA recommended a different approach to determine the value of CT, involvingthe performance of a third test. The test includes door openings, multipleunit test data for statistical certainty, and specific (different) dryand wet bulb temperatures for the environmental chamber. AHAM providedfield test data as support documentation. The data included informationon door openings and time between defrost cycles in four geographical regions.AHAM recommended that a single basic model be tested and the test resultsbe applied to each of the manufacturer's VDC-equipped models. AHAM indicatedthat this third test would be extremely burdensome if required for allmodels. DOE agrees that the test is burdensome because of the differingambient temperature and humidity test conditions, extreme time requirement,over 100 hours, and the addition of door openings. DOE also believes thattest results from one basic model can not be assigned to other basic modelsbecause varing door styles, capacities and features will impact test results.Therefore, DOE is proposing VDC-equipped models be tested according tothe existing long-term defrost test. CT is to be calculated using a valuefor F of 0.2 and that at the manufacturer's option a test can be performedto determine CT.An optional third test is included in today's proposed rule which allowsmanufacturers to determine the value of F and CT. This third test is providedas an optional method of determining the value of CT for manufactures thatbelieve the unit will operate with a substantially better frequency valuethan the F=0.2 established in the proposed rule. The burden associatedwith documenting an actual value for CT makes the optional testing of limiteduse to manufacturers. The test is based on procedures proposed by AHAMand modified by DOE. The only purpose of this test is to determine compressoron-time between defrosts for VDC equipped models. It has no applicationfor any model equipped only with a compressor timer for automatic defrostor with no automatic defrost features. This test, which requires multipleunits be tested for statistical compliance, involves door openings in anenvironmental chamber at specific new ambient conditions. The test requiresa stabilization period consisting of three defrost intervals run from theend of one defrost to the end of the next defrost. The average durationbetween defrosts of the three intervals would establish the value of CT.The optional test includes 24 fresh food and six freezer compartment dooropenings each for 12andplusmin;2 seconds. The purpose of these openings isto trigger the features other than compressor on-time in the manufacturer'salgorithm. The door openings allow for the transfer of warm humid air intothe respective compartment, thereby increasing frost build-up. Multipleunits of the same model will be tested to achieve a 95 percent confidencein the time between defrosts. DOE believes that the time intensivenessof this optional test will lead most manufacturers to accept the DOE valueof F and only those VDC systems with exceptionally better values for Fwill be tested.b. Method of Testing Dual Compressor Refrigerator-Freezer UnitsThe concept of dual compressors was raised as an energy efficiency measureduring the evaluation of energy conservation standard levels for refrigerator-freezers.This notice, however, does not address the effectiveness of dual compressorsin energy efficiency. DOE is proposing to establish test procedures forautomatic defrost refrigerator-freezers with dual compressor systems.A refrigerator-freezer model with a dual compressor system operates astwo separate systems, one for each section of the cabinet. The existingtest procedure assumes a single system. For the most part, the test procedureis unaffected by dual compressors, however, the defrost energy measurementportion of the test is affected. Since both compressor systems do not defrostat the same frequency or at the same time, the measurement of defrost energyis more complicated for a dual compressor system. The freezer section,although smaller than the refrigerator section, operates more often tomaintain the colder temperature. The freezer section also builds frostfaster, requiring more defrosts.To measure the energy consumption of dual compressor refrigerator-freezers,the DOE test procedure in Appendix A1 is used, modified only for thosemodels with automatic defrost. The testing difference occurs because measuringthe defrost energy in automatic defrost models is affected by the morefrequent operation of the freezer compressor system, which activates moredefrosts. Assuming both defrost timers are set for 12 hours of compressoron-time, the freezer will defrost sooner than the refrigerator. DOE proposesthat an independent measurement of defrost energy for each system be performed.The test will measure the energy used for two defrost cycles for each systemand the time elapsed between cycles. The freezer compressor is consideredthe primary system since the large temperature difference causes it tocycle more frequently than the refrigerator system. Both systems' energymeasurements are included in the total energy equation.The test conditions remain the same. Additional measurement devices (wattmeters, timers, etc.) are incorporated to measure the energy consumptionof each compressor system.DOE expects this proposed method of evaluating energy consumption for dualcompressor units to create a minimum burden on manufacturers and to providea comparison with single compressor units. The proposed test proceduresapply to automatic defrost units only; dual systems with manual defrostare to be tested according to the existing test procedure for single compressorunits.c. Through-The-Door-FeaturesSeveral manufacturers, in an effort to provide the customer with increasedutility and anticipated energy savings, have developed through-the-door,multi-door, and other special door features. These features could resultin the unit using more energy during testing due to a lack of insulation.However, because the number of door openings could be reduced, these featurescould also result in energy savings. These special features, however, provideutility in the form of convenient ice dispensing to the consumer. The existingDOE test procedure for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers does notuse actual door openings; instead, it increases the surrounding temperatureto increase heat transfer to compensate for the exchange of air that occursduring door openings and the internal loads. Therefore, the test procedurecannot measure any energy savings due to reduced door openings.The Department considered these new designs in its review of informationand data for this rulemaking. However, DOE was unable to obtain sufficientdocumentation and/or test data from manufacturers, trade associations orprofessional organizations prior to this rulemaking concerning the energyconsumption of a door opening. A review of previous rulemakings and availabledata indicated that one available option was to expand the refrigerator-freezerclasses to include all door features. This was viewed as unacceptable becauseeach feature would count the same. DOE also believes that this option mostlikely would confuse consumers and reduce the potential for energy savings.A second option would be to amend the existing test procedure. However,no data has been presented to support claims that the energy saved by fewerlarge door openings saves energy above that used to compensate for increaseddoor edge and gasket area and decreased door insulation. Although severalmanufacturers have expressed a desire to have the models so equipped receivea form of energy credit, the lack of data makes it difficult for DOE tojustify amending the existing test procedure. Therefore, DOE is not includingany measures in today's notice which would amend test procedures for refrigerator-freezermodels with through-the-door features, refreshment centers, or multiplecompartment/multidoor refrigerator or freezer sections.d. Rapid or Quick Freeze FeatureThe quick freeze feature is found primarily on freezers. DOE believes thatthis option is always consumer controlled, i.e., it is operated (turnedon and off) manually. Activation of the quick freeze feature places thecompressor in a steady-state condition. Its purpose is to freeze rapidlynon-frozen items upon placement in the freezer.The quick freeze feature is an option being introduced on some new modelsof freezers. Since the current test procedure does not address manuallyoperated options, DOE examined the adequacy of the test procedure to determineif it provides accurate and fair measures of energy consumption. By analyzingthe option's function in the freezer, DOE determined that the quick freezefeature acts as a thermostat override, allowing the compressor to operatecontinuously. However, it also was apparent that the consumer could performa similar function by adjusting the thermostat to the coldest setting.The quick freeze option, however, gives the consumer a single switch allowingthe freezer to return to the original thermostat setting and, in some designs,includes a reminder light.DOE believes that the test procedure for freezers in Appendix B-1, 10 CFRPart 430 is sufficient for testing models equipped with manually operatedfeatures such as quick freeze. DOE proposes to amend the test procedureto indicate that the consumer operated feature, quick freeze, will remainoff unless it is necessary to bypass the thermostat to cause the compressorto run continuously as described in section 3.1 of Appendix B1. By thisamendment to the test procedure, DOE believes that an option with utilityto the consumer will be rated fairly and accurately.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>a.

Environmental Review</ITAG>Pursuant to section 7(c)(2) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of1974, a copy of this notice has been submitted to the Administrator ofthe Environmental Protection Agency for his comments concerning the impactof this proposal on the quality of the environment.Since test procedures under the energy conservation program for consumerproducts will be used only to standardize the measurement of energy usage,and will not affect the quality of distribution of energy usage, prescribingtest procedures will not result in any environmental impacts. DOE, therefore,has determined that prescribing test procedures under the energy conservationprogram for consumer products clearly is not a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Consequently, neither an EnvironmentalStatement nor an Environmental Assessment is required for the proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Review Under Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291 which directs that all regulations achieve their intended goals withoutimposing unnecessary burdens on the economy, on individuals, on publicor private organizations, or on State and local governments. The ExecutiveOrder also requires that regulatory impact analyses be prepared for ``majorrules.'' The Executive Order defines ``major rule'' as any regulation thatis likely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The proposed rule would amend already-existing test procedures for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. DOE has determined that any burdenimposed on any person, industry, or government entity by the amendmentof extent procedures, based in part on commercial standards, is not significantto bring the proposed rules within the definition of ``major rule.''<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-345 (5 U.S.C. 601-612), requiresthat an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to bepublished at the time the proposed rule is published. This requirement(which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency ``certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.'' The proposed rule affectsmanufacturers of refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. Aspreviously discussed, the proposed changes would not have significant economicimpact, but rather would simply improve the test procedures. Therefore,DOE certifies that the proposed rule, if promulgated, would not have a``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. ``Takings'' Assessment Review</ITAG>Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in proposinga regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review isintended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help suchagencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate.For purposes of the Order: ``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations,proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments onproposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that,if implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulationsthat propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition requirementsor limitations on private property use, or that require dedications orexactions from owners of private property. It appears that there are three parts of the appliance standards programthat could conceivably be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' Theseare testing (certification) requirements, the impacts of standard levels,and possible DOE testing of products for validation. This proposed rulemaking is concerned with the first part, namely, testing.The Department believes that such a requirement does not constitute a ``taking''of private property. The establishment of test procedures involves no exchangeof property. Manufacturers maintain control of the property for all intentsand purposes. Therefore, the Department believes that the requirement of testing andthe establishment of test procedures as part of the appliance standardsprogram do not represent a ``taking'' under the provisions of E.O. 12630.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 430 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Energy conservation, Household appliances.In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed to amend Part 430 ofChapter II of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, September 9, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
