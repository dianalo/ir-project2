In addition, the orthorhombic o-Al(MnFe) andcubic {alpha}- and hexagonal {beta}-Al(MnFe)Si phases are studied. Weshow that previous MS results are inadequate to determine if there aretwo sites in the i-AlMn structure in the ratio of the golden number.Our results for i-Al(MnFe) show that the dominant EFG is negative, withasymmetry parameter of about 0.6. For i-Al(CrFe), essentially no deviationsare found from the model of Czjzek or the Gaussian isotropic model. The{beta} phase is found to have a very similar quadrupole effect as thatin i-Al(MnFe).</TEXT></DOC>
