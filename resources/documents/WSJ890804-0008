Although the evidence compiled by prosecutors already has persuaded a number of traders to opt for guilty pleas, some lawyers say the Justice Department used a blunderbuss instead of a marksman's rifle to bag its prey. As a result, while defense attorneys try to pry holes in the government's case, they'll also argue that their clients were only pursuing traditional pit practices.    At the core of the government's cases in at least half of the indictment counts are charges of fraud that will be the most difficult for defense attorneys to combat. These are cases where prearranged trades are alleged to have enriched trader-brokers at the expense of their clients.    Assuming the government can prove its facts, it will be hard for defense attorneys to dispute that there is a legally mandated fiduciary duty that exists between a broker and his client, according to John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor and leading securities and criminal law expert.    On the other hand, defense lawyers will try to show that their clients lacked the specific intent to defraud their customers required under current Supreme Court interpretation of the mail-fraud statutes.    Similarly, while prosecutors could very well prove some of the acts necessary to gain a conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, defendants may be able to defeat the attempt to label the entire Chicago Mercantile Exchange or Chicago Board of Trade as the criminal &quot;enterprises&quot; required for prosecution under that law.    Even if the government had claimed that individual pits were &quot;enduring recognized&quot; enterprises for racketeering purposes as the law requires, observers say, prosecutors would be pointing to groups too large or amorphous to make the charge stick. &quot;When you're talking about a whole pit, let alone an exchange, some of these guys don't even know each other,&quot; according to one criminal defense lawyer not involved in these cases.    But the indictments also go after common market practices that aren't specifically prohibited under federal law and some of which aren't even violations of exchange rules. Instead, the indictments in effect argue that such common occurrences as front-running or curb (after hours) trading violate general federal strictures against wire or mail fraud. Defense attorneys charge that this is an attempt to achieve by criminal prosecution what more properly should be done by legislation or regulation.    Until the indictments, these practices were &quot;almost customary,&quot; according to Thomas Anthony Durkin, attorney for yen pit trader Sam A. Cali. U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas &quot;isn't wrong for investigating the marketplace. The 'Catch-22' is, do you all of a sudden label everybody racketeers {for long-accepted practices} because they were standing next to the guy with the microphone?&quot;    Mr. Durkin added, &quot;If they had had 50 moles, the whole place would have been shut down.&quot;    There are currently no specific laws against front-running, the practice where a broker trades for his own account in anticipation of a major order from one of his customers. Although Congress is attempting to rush limitations through in the wake of the Chicago investigation, the current prosecutions are &quot;a case of regulation by indictment,&quot; according to Mr. Coffee.    &quot;Instead of prosecuting people in an area where the government thinks reforms needed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should adopt rules and spell out clear-cut policies,&quot; Mr. Coffee said. &quot;But you don't go after people who are behaving in a way that is traditional to the system. You don't use the criminal law to intervene.&quot;    Defense lawyers were also quick to note that federal prosecutors launched their public relations salvo Wednesday without the traditional estimate of how much money the alleged crimes involved. The U.S. attorney's office has said only that the charges involve thousands of trades and hundreds of cheated clients.    The prosecutors may be avoiding a total-dollar estimate of money allegedly defrauded from investors because it's less than $1 million, some defense attorneys speculate, and therefore unimpressive to the news media and the public. &quot;That doesn't give you many bragging rights,&quot; said one defense attorney.    Nevertheless, the leaders of the exchanges may move more quickly than even the prosecutors. The Merc has already tried to claim the seats of any traders ultimately convicted in the scandal to use for &quot;restitution&quot; to defrauded investors. If the prosecutors get their way, however, traders convicted under RICO would forfeit their seats to the government before the Merc could touch them.    And the Merc's fiery leader, Leo Melamed, seems intent on preserving his exchange's self-regulation. Yesterday in a news conference at the Merc, Mr. Melamed declared with fists clenched that any government ukase on the exchange's rules wouldn't be good &quot;for America.&quot; To clean up house at the Merc, Mr. Melamed vowed to &quot;instill the fear of God&quot; into &quot;a handful of immoral people.&quot;    But Mr. Coffee doubts that will be enough: &quot;As long as you have the open-outcry, dual-trading system built in to the Chicago exchanges, there will always be problems in the area of front-running and trading in general with knowledge of the clients' orders. If you want to do something about this, you end the dual trading system.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
