The recommendations were made last night in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by this newspaper, from the Merc's board of governors to the exchange membership. Merc officials couldn't be reached to comment on the letter.    The board made its recommendations in response to a Feb. 25 petition signed by several hundred traders in the Merc's Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit. The petition called for an outright ban on Sandamp;P 500 floor brokers trading for their own accounts and customers on the same day. The board recommended that the membership reject the petition. If the petition is rejected, it said, the board would adopt less-onerous rule changes. The letter didn't say when the membership would vote on the issue.    The recommendations would prohibit brokers standing on the top step of the Sandamp;P 500 pit, where customer orders enter the pit, from trading for their own accounts. They would also require Sandamp;P 500 brokers trading for their own accounts to manually record the time of their trades to the nearest minute. And the recommendations would limit trading within so-called broker associations in the Sandamp;P 500 pit.    The board's letter said that &quot;the petition suggests a single sweeping solution to complex and multifaceted problems. It is not carefully thought out and if implemented would impede our continued growth.&quot;    The restrictions wouldn't apply to other trading pits at the Merc.    The proposed restrictions come as the Merc is under increasing pressure from its major Wall Street customers, regulators and even many of its own members to clean up certain trading practices in its burgeoning Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit.    Trading in Sandamp;P 500 futures, in effect a bet placed on the future price of the stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 index for a fraction of the price of owning the stocks, often directly influences stock market prices.    Critics of dual trading say that it allows floor brokers to trade ahead of customers and profit from the impact large customer orders may have on the market. Trading ahead of customers violates existing exchange rules, but Merc members say that the practice often escapes detection.    Dual trading abuses are alleged by futures traders and many Merc members to be especially widespread in the Sandamp;P 500 pit. &quot;We've tended to concentrate in the bonds and not in the Sandamp;Ps because you just get taken in the Sandamp;Ps. It's a killer market,&quot; claimed one official of a futures trading firm.    Futures exchanges historically have allowed dual trading by brokers because it increases trading volume, which in theory leads to more efficient markets. Dual trading also gives floor brokers a source of income to supplement customer commissions.    But in a pit as large as the Merc's Sandamp;P 500 pit, which alone accounts for about 75% of all stock-index futures trading, liquidity provided by floor brokers isn't needed to maintain efficient markets, traders say. The volume of customer business also provides ample commission income for floor brokers.    The board recommended that brokers standing on the Sandamp;P 500 pit's top step, having the clearest view of most orders being &quot;flashed&quot; by hand signal or carried into the pit, be allowed to only fill customer orders. &quot;Once a broker has executed a customer order on the top step, he may not that day trade for his own account in the Sandamp;P 500 futures pit,&quot; the letter said. The board said that this restriction would ease pit congestion and satisfy complaints that brokers on the top step have a &quot;geographical&quot; advantage when trading for their own accounts.    The proposed requirement that Sandamp;P 500 brokers manually record the times of personal trades would be in addition to a computerized audit trail system the Merc is implementing in response to regulatory demands for more-accurate order tracing.    The board said it also would &quot;impose strict limits on trading within a broker group&quot; by redefining groups to cover all forms of associations within the Sandamp;P 500 pit. It also said it would put percentage limits on the amount of personal trading and customer order-filling group members can carry out among themselves. </TEXT></DOC>
