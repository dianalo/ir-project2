Reflecting intense bipartisan pressure to shrink militaryspending in light of reduced U.S.-Soviet tensions, thecommittee rejected additional purchases of B-2 Stealthbombers, built by Northrop Corp. The panel also eliminatedall funds to begin deploying nuclear-tipped MX missiles onspecial railroad cars, and it slashed funds for research onthe Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed space-basedantimissile shield.</LP><TEXT>   Proposed cuts in these three areas alone -- which includethe administration's most sought-after defense items --account for nearly one quarter of the committee's overall $24billion cut from Mr. Bush's military spending blueprint forthe fiscal year starting Oct. 1. The vote on the B-2 was34-20, with nine Republicans voting to halt additionalpurchases.   Even Republicans shied away from an all-out committeebattle to try to save the radar-eluding B-2 or mobile MX, forinstance, because support for both weapons is bleaker in thefull House. Funding for SDI, which the panel reduced to lessthan $3 billion from the administration's $4.7 billionrequest, is almost certain to face another round of proposedcutbacks when the bill reaches the House floor in September,when lawmakers return from their August recess.   &quot;The bill reflects the changes in the world,&quot; said Rep.John Kasich (R., Ohio). The committee's message, added Rep.Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), is that &quot;we're not going to getinto a bidding war with the Soviets to see who is more machoby spending more on defense.&quot;   After meeting behind closed doors for much of the day,lawmakers also approved cutting 129,500 troops -- at least50,000 of which are supposed to come from Europe -- from thecurrent 2.1 million active-duty force by the fall of 1991.The administration had proposed trimming slightly more than40,000 troops.   The committee's bill is bound to upset the Pentagon inother ways, too. Reflecting lawmakers' often parochialconcerns to keep bases open and save local defense jobs, themeasure projects adding some 22,000 reservists to the forcein fiscal 1991. And, over the objections of Defense SecretaryDick Cheney, lawmakers authorized some $400 million fordevelopment and long-lead procurement of parts for the MarineCorps' proposed V-22 tilt-rotor troop transport. Theadministration tried but failed to kill the transport in lastyear's budget.   The final version of the bill, in part, represents anendorsement of Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), who opposednearly all of the big-ticket items that were cut and workedhard behind the scenes to cobble together bipartisancompromises on other weapons. But in the process, Rep. Aspinapparently traded away any chance to kill the V-22, shut downall production lines for the Army's M-1 tank or begin phasingout production of front-line F-15 Air Force fighters -- allinitiatives embraced by the administration and by Rep. Aspinin the past.   The Senate, which is slated to complete action on itsversion of the defense bill in the next few days, is bound tobe more generous than the House in supporting the B-2 bomber,SDI and other administration priorities. But there, too,political horsetrading is expected to keep alive certainexpensive programs the administration is eager to end.   As expected, the committee also shelved for theforeseeable future production of the Army's proposed $42billion fleet of LH helicopters, the Air Force's nextgeneration front-line fighters and the troubled C-17 cargoplanes. The new ground rules adopted by the panel, intendedto delay production of more than $120 billion of aircraft,call for testing prototypes and completing engineering workbefore deciding whether to begin full-rate production.   Although the LH has been the Army's most cherished weaponsprogram for years, opponents won a surprising 32-22 vote toplace it on hold. &quot;The Army wanted to start bending metalnext year,&quot; said Rep. Larry Hopkins (R., Ky.), one of thehelicopter's leading critics. &quot;But the LH is dead. There's nodoubt about that.&quot;   The committee also voted to postpone further purchases ofthe Air Force's C-17, built by a McDonnell Douglas Corp.unit. Rep. Albert G. Bustamante (D., Texas) said thecommittee voted to withhold production funds until at least1992, pending the results of C-17 flight tests.   The go-slow approach embraced by the panel also slashedproduction funds from the Navy's carrier-based, A-12 attackplanes, which the Pentagon acknowledges have &quot;seriousproblems&quot; meeting weight requirements and productionschedules. Moreover, lawmakers voted to withhold all of the$1.32 billion in production money sought for the Air Force'sAMRAAM air-to-air missile. And the committee barred thePentagon from spending more than $2.7 billion of long-leadproduction money until Congress receives the detailedfive-year spending plan required by law.</TEXT></DOC>
