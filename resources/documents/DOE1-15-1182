A method has been suggested to measure the fastneutron fluence by counting the track density on the surface of the CR-39plastic track detector. Track producing particles resulted from the (n,/sup 4/He) reaction from the constituents of the plastic track detectoritself. Tracks were developed by chemical etching method. It has beenconcluded that by this method, CR-39 plastic track detector can be usedfor measuring 14 MeV neutron fluences ranging from 10/sup 8/n/cm/sup2/ to 10/sup 10//cm/sup 2/.</TEXT></DOC>
