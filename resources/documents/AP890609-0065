Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, alsotold The Associated Press in an interview that the gradualwithdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea could begin in 1992 ifthe Seoul government is confident it can defend itself againstcommunist North Korea.   Park said Roh had ruled out any vote of confidence because suchballoting could create political unrest. Roh has yet to make anofficial announcement on the referendum.   ``We're excluding any possibility of a national referendum (onRoh),'' Park said. ``The president is going to perform his duties upto the last day of his term. We feel that's what the majority of thepeople want.''   Roh had promised before presidential elections in December 1987to hold a referendum on his performance after the September 1988Olympic Games in Seoul. Roh, a former general, won the electionsafter rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote.   Roh postponed a referendum in March, saying it threatened tocreate a major political confrontation. Some opposition leaders hadsaid Roh would have to resign if he lost the referendum.   Park said the government was not ruling out national referendumson major issues, but there would be no vote that would require Rohto resign if the administration lost. He said opinion polls clearlyshowed public sentiment was against a referendum.   Park also said public opposition to anti-government dissidentswas growing and the dissidents were losing strength. He said thegovernment had cracked down on dissidents because they posed aviolent threat to the government and the public had to be reassured.   Police today used tear gas to break up a protest by radicalstudents demanding to go to North Korea, and troopers raided a Seoulcollege to search for pro-communist literature. Three hundredstudents were reported arrested.   On foreign affairs, Park said he did not see much hope for aquick end to the bitter confrontation with communist North Korea. Hesaid a recent South Korean drive to improve relations failed to makesubstantial progress.   ``We were too unrealistic,'' he said.   Park also expressed concern that recent unrest in China mayprompt North Korea's totalitarian government to enforce its rule andblock liberalization. The one hope for improving relations was theNorth's growing economic crisis and its desperate need for aid fromSouth Korea and other nations, he said.   The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 and the Northinvaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War.   Park said he favors a long-term U.S. military presence in theSouth, but gradual withdrawal could begin from 1992 if Seoul isconfident it can defend itself against the North. Some dissidentshave called for expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in theSouth.   The party chairman also said South Korea has to end politicalquarreling over the legacy of the authoritarian regime of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan. Chun, a former general who took power withmilitary backing in 1980, stepped down in 1988 at the end of histerm and is now living in rural exile.   Opposition parties have been demanding Chun atone forhuman-rights abuses and corruption under his rule. Park said Chunwas responsibile for any abuses under his government and Roh couldnot be blamed, even though he was one of Chun's closest associatesand his chosen successor.   Park said he did not know how the dispute, which has dominateddomestic politics, could be settled since the opposition appeareddetermined to punish Chun. ``They want to see some suffering,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
