The latest explanation is at variance with past statementsthe military has made about the barracks destruction. At thetime of the Feb. 25 attack, a U.S. central command spokesmanblamed the disaster on the Scud's breaking up in theatmosphere. But more recently, U.S. officials acknowledgedthat nearly every Scud broke up during descent, making thebarracks attack seem routine rather than unusual.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, an Army spokesman in Huntsville, Ala., changedthe story again. He said that the Scud was intact when itlanded on the barracks. Presumably, this would have given thePatriots a bigger target to hit, but neither of the twoPatriot batteries in range fired any missiles at the Scud.The spokesman said that one of the batteries was down forrepairs, while the radar on the other battery wasn't workingbecause of a computer software failure.   The Army spokesman said he couldn't explain why themilitary had changed its account of what happened. The NewYork Times reported on the barracks controversy yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
