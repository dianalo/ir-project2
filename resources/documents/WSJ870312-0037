Heckert, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;Now it's time for the good results to begin to flow.&quot;    Mr. Heckert said 1987 profit should be &quot;somewhat better&quot; than last year's net income of $1.5 billion, or $6.35 a share, barring an unforeseen change in the economy. Such variables as the price of oil, international trade balances and the profitability of the automotive industry make a more precise prediction difficult, he said.    The chemicals and energy giant expects most of its growth to be &quot;internally generated&quot; through research and development, rather than through acquisitions. This year, the company plans to match 1986 spending of $1.1 billion on such research.    Du Pont went on an acquisition binge last year, spending about $1 billion for companies and businesses, the most it has spent in a single year since it bought Conoco Inc. in 1981 for $6.8 billion. Last year's targets included the U.S. agricultural-chemicals business of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., Ford Motor Co.'s automotive-paint operations and Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.'s American Critical Care unit. All three will contribute to Du Pont's 1987 earnings.    In contrast, the acquisition pace this year should be &quot;less busy,&quot; Mr. Heckert said in an interview. But he noted that Du Pont &quot;doesn't feel constrained from making a major acquisition&quot; whenever conditions are right. John J. Quindlen, chief financial officer, said the company's core businesses are generating a &quot;discretionary&quot; cash flow of $4.5 billion a year.    Du Pont &quot;might make a major play&quot; in the pharmaceuticals area, but it isn't in any hurry to do so, Mr. Heckert said. &quot;Du Pont doesn't need diversification for its own sake.&quot; Neither does it want to buy &quot;somebody else's unique contribution that's already fully priced.&quot; For example, he indicated that Du Pont wouldn't be interested in acquiring A.H. Robins Co., the health-products maker that has been in bankruptcy-law proceedings since August 1985.    Du Pont's core businesses of textile fibers, polymer products and chemicals will be big contributors to 1987 earnings and are &quot;throwing off cash&quot; to support smaller, faster-growing segments.    The fibers segment, which earned $542 million last year, has been experiencing annual productivity gains of 7%. Response has been strong to a new line of stain-resistant carpet material and Kevlar, a steel-like fiber used in such items as clothing, bulletproof vests and helmets. Polymer products, which contributed $266 million to 1986 profit, is &quot;having a renaissance&quot; by branching out into thermoplastics, Mr. Heckert said.    Du Pont's biomedical-products segment is still evolving. Mr. Heckert said he hopes it will have a &quot;major impact&quot; on earnings by 1990. In the meantime, he said, &quot;it's not a drain.&quot; He added, &quot;We'll just take our time.&quot; Much of the emphasis is likely to remain on diagnostic products and medical services, but Du Pont researchers also are developing blood-processing systems and drugs. &quot;When we find the right formula for pharmaceuticals, we'll go at it,&quot; Mr. Heckert said.    In recent years, Du Pont has trimmed its work force about 20%, to 141,000 employees from 175,000. No more big cutbacks are planned, but the streamlining has become a constant at Du Pont.    &quot;We have less bureaucracy, the paperflow is shrinking and we will continue to become more efficient,&quot; Mr. Heckert said. Though he said he is eager for Du Pont to get &quot;back in the growth mode&quot; through joint ventures, selective internal expansion and some acquisitions, &quot;I'm not anxious to see us in a fattening mode.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Du Pont shares closed at $109, up $1. </TEXT></DOC>
