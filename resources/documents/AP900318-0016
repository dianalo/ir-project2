In a last-minute warning, opposition parties alleged that formersecret police may vote more than once to prop up Communistcandidates.   About 12.2 million voters were eligible to cast ballots for a400-seat Parliament. With the likelihood of a merger with WestGermany, the balloting could have been the 41-year-old nation'sfirst and last free election.   West German television was expected to make its firstprojections two hours after polls close at 6 p.m. (noon EST).   Final results weren't expected until Monday.   Hans Modrow, Communist premier of East Germany's caretakergovernment, was among the early-risers to go to the polls. Modrowwas greeted with applause when he showed up at a polling site inEast Berlin.   ``The last days and weeks have shown that the citizens of theGDR see this election as very important for the country's furtherdevelopment,'' Modrow said, according to East Germany's ADN newsagency.   Modrow repeated his belief that the process of Germanunification cannot be separated from what happens in the rest ofEurope, said ADN.   ``Only then, if we proceed with level-headedness, will people inEurope be able to have a good opinion of us. And that is theresponsibility we are carrying,'' ADN quoted him as saying.   Voters chose from a dizzying array of 24 parties and groups. Allmajor parties support unification but at a different pace. Someconservative parties urge a quick merger, while leftist groupsfavor a more cautious approach. Most East Germans agree such ajoining is inevitable.   International election observers fanned out to monitor theballoting.   In East Berlin, 10 members of an election-monitoring delegationfrom the Council of Europe started headed for their destinations invarious parts of East Germany. ``The group wants to visit as manyvoting places as possible,'' delegation head Sir Geoffrey Finsbergof Britain was quoted as saying by ADN.   Most polling places opened at 7 a.m., but many industrialworkers were permitted to start voting two hours earlier, justbefore they went to work.   Juergen Myrau, an engineer at the Buna chemical factory nearHalle, showed up to vote shortly after the 5 a.m. poll-openingtime. ``It's a great feeling to go to a free election,'' ADN quotedMyrau as saying.   Wolfgang Koegel, an employee at a power plant in Suhl, asouthwestern city near the West German border, was the first tovote in his district.   ``No one really knows who's going to b elected. But by all meansI am for a better future, especially when I think about my twochildren,'' he told ADN.   Like other countries in the Soviet bloc, East Germany'spolitical landscape was redrawn last year by a pro-democracyrevolution that ousted its hard-line Communist leadership. In theupheaval that followed, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fledto the West, the Berlin Wall was opened and reunification became arallying cry in East and West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
