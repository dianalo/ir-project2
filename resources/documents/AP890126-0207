The rocket left the European Space Agency launch pad on theAtlantic coast of South America 10:21 p.m. after a 53-minute delaycaused by an indicator light mistakenly suggesting a malfunctioningvalve on a hydrogen reservoir, Arianespace officials said.   The faulty indicator automatically halted the countdown 18seconds before the scheduled liftoff. But technicians were able todetermine quickly that the valve was working properly, allowing thelaunch to proceed.   About 35 minutes after the launch, Arianespace officialsannounced that the satellite was in orbit and declared the mission asuccess. In the coming days, the orbit will be adjusted to stationthe Intersat V-F15 over the Indian Ocean.   The 4,400-pound satellite, with 36 transponders to carrytelevision and telephone communications, is to join 13 othersoperated by Intelsat. The International Telecommunications SatelliteOrganization is a non-profit cooperative of 115 countries.   The Intelsat network carries more than half of all internationaltelephone calls and nearly all transoceanic television transmissions.   The launch is the first of the year for Arianespace, a consortiumof 50 European companies responsible for the commercial exploitationof the Ariane series of rockets developed by the European SpaceAgency.   In seven launches last year, all successful, Arianespace put 13satellites in orbit last year for various clients.</TEXT></DOC>
