It is based on information collectedduring personal interviews with industrial energy users, equipment suppliers,trade associations, consultants and related personnel. It is apparentfrom responses to this survey that achieving higher energy efficiency,commitment from the chief executives is required. In order to obtainthis commitment, the need for such a program and its purpose must bewell explained. The level of concern about energy is generally superficialdue to conflicting reports on the true state of Canada's energy reserves.Poor Canadian economic performance has tended to mean that industry concentrateson profits instead of new plant and equipment. Profitability of a particularcorporation has an enormous effect on investment; the greater the profitability,the greater the capital for investing and the more likely the corporationwill invest in projects of slow return on investment. Average currentinvestment strategies call for a return on capital of no longer thantwo years. Very capital-intensive industries find it costly to make majorenergy efficiency improvements because whole sections of plants haveto be rebuilt. In the current business climate, a powerful incentiveis needed to attract the required capital. The Anti-Inflation Board isseen as a major disincentive to all investment in improved energy efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
