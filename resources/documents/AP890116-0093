Shultz willmark the end of his 6{-year diplomatic career with a speech Tuesdaythat mixes praise for the Soviet Union with a call for continuingreforms.   Shultz is in the Austrian capital to mark the end of a 27-monthreview of the Helsinki agreement, a 35-nation accord in 1975 thatproposed to reduce East-West tensions and promote democracy.   The final document reinforces the human rights message and alsourges all nations to keep their guard up against terrorism.   Shultz praised the Vienna accord adopted Sunday on his way toVienna from Washington. In turn, he earned rare praise from theSoviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda as one of the architects ofthe recent upswing in Soviet-U.S. relations.   The often stodgy party daily drew an unusually warm and humanpicture of Shultz, depicting him as a gourmet father of five whoenjoys tennis, golf and ballroom dancing.   A congressional delegation, in Vienna to monitor developments,joined Shultz in praise of what has been accomplished in the SovietUnion under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``We ought to be optimistic,'' said the chairman, Rep. StenyHoyer, D-Md., ``The most optimstic of us would not have preicted theprogtress that has cpoccurred.''   He cited a ``dramatic reduction'' in the number of Sovietpolitical prisoners, rising emigration and the reunification offamilies.   Still, Hoyer criticized the ``gross intimidation'' ofdemonstrators in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on Sunday, and said thecongressional oversight group was aware of about 130 cases of peopleheld in Soviet mental institutions and jails who may be politicalvictims of ``trumped-up charges.''   The State Department credits the Soviets with more than 600releases but Hoyer said, ``We haven't reached zero.''   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the declaration adopted Sunday``adds another step to the recognition of changing attitudes'' ineastern Europe.   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said it would be harder to fend offWestern inquiries into human rights abuses by saying ``this is aninternal affair.''   The accord sets down for the first time a mechanism allowingWestern governments to raise human rights issues on a bilaterallevel with any East bloc nation at any moment.   Shultz praised the Soviets for gradually implementing thepromises held out by the Helsinki agreement.   ``Real progress has been made, particularly in the last two orthree years,'' he said.   But Shultz also called on the Soviets to take at least twospecific steps to maintain the momentum.   He wants the jamming transmitters silenced by Gorbachev last yeardismantled so that jamming of Western radio stations cannot resume.   And he described the Berlin Wall, which fences out East Germanfrom fleeing to West Berlin as ``one of the acid tests'' of Sovietperformance.   ``Until that wall comes down, it's just there,'' Shultz said.``And it's more than a symbol.''   Reflecting on his long diplomatic career, Shultz said ``thethings I feel best about had to do with the area of human rights.''   He said ``the one incident that always sticks with me is the dayI had a phone call from Ida Nudel saying, `I'm home.' I still tinglea little as I think of it.''   Mrs. Nudel, a long-term Jewish dissident, emigrated last yearfrom the Soviet Union to Israel after Shultz pressed her case withSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.   ``These things that have a human scale to them, I think, probablyfor most people, are the ones that you get the greatest and deepestgood feeling about,'' Shultz said.   Pravda singled out human feelings in its article on Shultz, wholeaves office this week.   ``Foreign policy is made by real people,'' it said. ``And it'sfair to say that one of the architects of the turn inSoviet-American relations was Shultz.''   ``Here, the realism of Shultz expressed itself, as well as hissober recognition that in the nuclear age the self-preservation ofour two countries could be guaranteed only by the means ofdialogue.''   Shultz established ``working, constructive relations'' withShevardnadze, Pravda noted. ``He did a lot.''</TEXT></DOC>
