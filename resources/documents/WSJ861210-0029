The action wasn't surprising. Wheeling last July took a $83.2 million charge to close two other facilities at the Monessen plant. The last remaining part of the mill was the continuous bloom caster, which feeds semifinished steel to the rail mill. But dire factors, including depressed demand for steel rails used in the transportation industry and heavy import penetration, sealed the caster's fate.    Wheeling-Pittsburgh last October offered to turn the rail mill over to the Economic Development Administration, the federal agency that helped finance the plant. In return, Wheeling reportedly asked the EDA to forgive as much as $70 million remaining on the rail-mill loan.    The steelmaker's unusual offer stemmed from its unsuccessful efforts to get financing to replace the Monessen blast furnaces with an electric furnace, a more efficient way of making steel. Wheeling apparently didn't get many takers on an estimated $40 million in new loans needed for the Monessen plant's electric furnace.    Wheeling, in effect, will hand over the assets of the rail mill to the EDA, which backed 90% of the $105 million loan to build the plant in 1981.    Wheeling, the nation's seventh-largest steelmaker, is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debt. </TEXT></DOC>
