Tokyo share prices ended down as profit-taking in financial shares chewed away the gains of an early-morning advance. The decline came despite continuing investor interest in specialty steels and machinery issues, prompted by big-broker sell campaigns that resulted in relatively heavy trading.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which fell 79.55 points Tuesday, fell an additional 27.31 to 22819.42. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 7.52 to 1837.03. First section volume was an active 680 million shares, up from 480 million shares a day earlier.    And in early trading in Tokyo on Thursday, shares were down further on worries about the dollar, with the Nikkei off 22.44 points to 22796.98 at the morning close.    As for Wednesday's session, traders said concern about the muted level of institutional participation also helped to push the Nikkei into the minus column by the last hour of trading. They said this stemmed from rumors of exchange rate losses in the U.S. Treasury bond market, crimping the amount of liquidity available for equities investments.    In the financial sector, Nomura dropped 50 yen to 3,010 ($23.58). Yamaichi eased 20 to 1,550. Banking shares, which account for a disproportionate part of the value in the exchange's first section, helped to pull most leading barometers to the minus side. Sanwa Bank skidded 120 to 2,380. Sumitomo Bank fell 30 to 3,360.    A firmer dollar in currency dealings strengthened sentiment toward exporters, traders said. Among electrical and computer stocks, Pioneer rose 40 to 2,510, though Toshiba was down 7 at 628. Other key electrical benchmarks, such as Hitachi and TDK, fell on profit-taking based on sentiment that they were overbought, but scores of others finished unchanged.    In the specialty steel sector, Tokyo Steel was up 10 at 3,360. Among machine-tool stocks, Amada gained 30 to 1,060. Okuma Machinery rose 17 to 895.    Weakness in Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone shares added confusion to trading patterns. Some investors have been looking at the high-priced issue to guide trading in communications-related and other issues. NTandamp;T was down 40,000 to 2.28 million yen a share.    London share prices closed higher, supported by favorable U.K. economic news and modestly bullish sentiment. But prices came off their best levels in late afternoon, as market makers marked prices down amid a lack of further buying interest.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 16.9 points at 1348.9. Volume eased to 568.8 million shares from 667.7 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index rose 19.8 to 1689.8, after peaking at 1698.1 on news that the U.K. budget surplus widened to #1.55 billion ($2.34 billion) in November from #982 million in October.    Positive market sentiment on takeover activity again focused on the oil sector, where Britoil has been the target of rival bids by British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield Co. BP's offer of 300 pence ($5.48) a share for 15% of Britoil, to raise BP's stake to 29.9%, expired Wednesday morning, and trading in Britoil shares was occasionally volatile as BP was expected to make a new bid, though none emerged. Arco has offered 350 pence a share for as much as 29.9% of Britoil. Britoil closed 14 pence higher at 406.    Meanwhile, the Kuwait Investment Office has continued building its stake in BP, largely through the purchase of BP's new partly paid shares. BP said late in the day the KIO owns 15.02% of BP's ordinary shares outstanding, up from 13.07% Monday.    British Airways said it has received acceptances or agreements to accept a total of 6.4% of the issued share capital of British Caledonian Group. BA has offered 115 of its shares for every 22 Caledonian shares, or #9.72 in cash or loan notes for each share. The offer rivals a competing bid by Scandinavian Airlines System. RTZ Corp. agreed to acquire MK Electric Group for 700 pence a share, or #262.8 million. MK rose 45 to 706.    Frankfurt stocks continued their rally for a second day in moderately active trading, aided by the dollar's stability and Wall Street's modest gains. But market observers said the rise stemmed mostly from market-tending by domestic institutions rather than real investor demand.    Auto stocks paced the market. Bayerische Motoren Werke surged 20.50 marks to 476.50 marks ($291.90) and Daimler-Benz climbed 16.50 to 628.50. A growing number of analysts are shifting these two stocks to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; on concern about a stagnating auto market and the lower dollar. Volkswagen rose 10.20 to 237. Porsche rose 10 to 443, as Chairman Peter Schutz decided to step down Dec. 31, following sharp criticism that he has made the company too dependent on the U.S. market. Porsche had to shorten shifts after U.S. sales of its luxury sports cars faltered this autumn.    Machinery makers posted solid gains, with MAN rising 6.50 to 135.50 and Linde adding 3 to 527. Steel and engineering group Mannesmann rose 1.80 to 116.80, but Thyssen eased 1 to 108.50 after its steel unit posted a fiscal 1987 loss of 223 million marks.    Deutsche Bank soared 11 to 417. Commerzbank rose 6.50 to 231. Dresdner Bank added 5 to 239.50.    Stocks closed up in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, and ended mixed in Brussels amid continued uncertainty about Belgium's new coalition government.    In Paris, trading was active as confidence was restored by the Wall Street gains and an improvement in France's trade account for November. Zurich prices firmed on the steady dollar, lower oil prices and Wall Street's performance. The Amsterdam market extended its recovery into a third day.    Share prices advanced in Hong Kong and Singapore, fell in Manila after six days of advances, and were mixed in Sydney.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                               Dec 15    Dec 14      Year U.S. ......................... 226.2     225.6    -  0.8 Britain ...................... 502.6     496.7    +  1.0 Canada ....................... 351.3     353.7    +  5.4 Japan ....................... 1091.0    1091.9    + 15.4 France ....................... 293.7     288.9    - 28.0 Germany ...................... 159.8     157.5    - 38.5 Hong Kong ................... 1484.3    1450.5    - 16.6 Switzerland .................. 139.3     138.4    - 30.6 Australia .................... 240.2     233.3    -  9.0 World index .................. 404.5     403.7    + 13.4</TEXT></DOC>
