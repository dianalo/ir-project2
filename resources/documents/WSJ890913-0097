The portable's biggest drawbacks: weight, size and price. It weighs nearly 16 pounds, is too bulky to fit either on a person's lap or an airline tray table and will cost $5,800 to $7,000.    &quot;At that price someone will have to really need one to buy it,&quot; said Neil Shapiro, who runs a computer bulletin board on Compuserve for Macintosh users.    Despite a lukewarm reception from enthusiasts, Apple is billing the machine as a &quot;no compromise Mac,&quot; citing a new type of display screen and a novel cursor mechanism, among other things. The company is expected to sell many of the portables because they use the same proprietary software as the company's popular Macintosh machines.    &quot;Apple will have no problem selling every unit it produces over the next six months,&quot; said Mark Eppley, president of Traveling Software Inc., Bothell, Wash., which makes software for portables. &quot;There's just incredible demand for a battery-operated Mac.&quot;    In its fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Apple, which will make the portables available immediately, is likely to sell nearly 100,000 portables, worth about $400 million, estimates Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. In its current fiscal year, Apple's total sales are expected to exceed $5 billion.    Besides adding to its bottom line, Apple hopes its new portable will enhance its reputation as a leader in bringing new computing technologies to market. Since the departure of co-founder Steven Jobs four years ago, the company has been criticized for introducing products that don't break new ground, but rely instead on well-worn technology. With the portable, John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, hopes to quell such talk by showing he's willing to push the margins of technology. &quot;Sculley's proving he's not riding on Jobs's coattails,&quot; Mr. Eppley said.    Others say it's too soon to tell whether the portable's display screen -- its major innovation -- is a boom or a bust.    Choosing the right display screen has always been at the heart of Apple's challenge in bringing a portable to market. For years, Apple held back from entering the business mainly because it couldn't find a display screen it felt could adequately represent its graphics-oriented software and point-and-click mouse cursor.    More than two years ago, the company decided to use a new, largely untried display in which each screen dot, or pixel, is turned on or off by an integrated circuit. This so-called active-matrix display gives a more vivid picture than liquid-crystal displays used in Zenith, Toshiba and other popular portables, but it costs more.    To keep costs down, Apple chose a black-and-white display. Even so, the new display is &quot;probably the most dazzling part of the portable,&quot; said Michele Preston, analyst at Salomon Brothers.    It's also the riskiest. Active-matrix displays are only available for use in computers today in small quantities because they are very difficult to manufacture. Because each is basically a sheet of semiconductors, several imperfections can spoil an entire display. Only one tiny U.S. firm builds them. Major Japanese electronics firms, including Sharp and Toshiba, have invested heavily in the technology, but they have decided to concentrate their efforts on far-costlier color displays.    That leaves Apple reliant on two small Japanese producers of active-matrix displays. Apple won't identify the display suppliers but sources say that they are Hosiden, the major supplier, and Kyocera, the newcomer.    Shortages of active-matrix displays could plague Apple for as long as two years, said Joseph Castellano, president of Stanford Resources Inc., which researches the electronic display market. Even then, &quot;it's likely that the most plentiful displays will be color,&quot; he said. &quot;No one's making a major investment in black-and-white.&quot;    Besides the short supply, there is another problem. While users of Apple's portable say the machine displays icons, graphics and a moving cursor flawlessly, they complain that the screen loses its luster in dull light.    Makers of competing portables say they aren't surprised. &quot;Apple's introducing a technology that's not a reliable, high-volume technology yet,&quot; said Andrew Czernek, vice president of marketing for Zenith Data Systems, a maker of portables. &quot;It's a potential product killer.&quot;    The other novel features in Apple's portable are less risky. Instead of a mouse, the machine uses a trackball, embedded in the keyboard, to direct the cursor. The life of the battery, meanwhile, was extended by reducing power consumption. An icon on screen illustrates the power remaining in the battery. This is made easier, sources said, because Apple selected a lead-acid battery rather than a conventional one.    The use of a lead-acid battery, however, may have so increased the portable's size and weight that few people will use it while they travel. </TEXT></DOC>
