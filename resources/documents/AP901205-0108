The group, which included the right-wing Soyuz group ofparliamentarians as well as the reformist Liberal-Democratic Party,all but called for a military coup as a means of solving thenation's problems.   The group's leaders announced the legislators were forming aNational Salvation Committee and demanded transfer of power to it,the state news agency Tass and the independent news agency Interfaxreported. The committee asked the army to help implement the plan,calling the military, ``the sole force still resisting thedisintegration of the state,'' Interfax reported.   Vladimir Zhirinovski, a leader of the Liberal-Democratic Partyand spokesman for the committee, said in a telephone interview thatthe coalition represented 400 lawmakers in the 2,250-memberCongress of Peoples' Deputies.   Sentiment for a crackdown also is widespread in the CommunistParty, which holds a majority in most of legislative bodies on thenational and local level. Many Communists want President Mikhail S.Gorbachev to call a state of emergency and enforce it through thearmed forces and the KGB security police.   The National Salvation Committee seemed to have the same goals,although its goals were not spelled out clearly during the newsconference its leaders called today to announce the group'sexistence.   With all but one of the 15 Soviet republics seeking some form ofindependence or autonomy from central government, many officialsfear for the very structure of the Soviet Union.   The Soviet economy also is crumbling as the old command systemis failing and grocery shelves in major cities are bare.   Across the capital, Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsinharshly warned military officers at the Dzerzhinsky MilitaryAcademy that ``if the army enters our boiling society as an activefactor, confrontation will increase many times, and carry thesociety to catastrophe.''</TEXT></DOC>
