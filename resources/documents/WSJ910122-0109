However, IBM isn't expected todisclose when it will put such a computer on the market.   Go's software is designed to run the basic functions of anew class of notebook-size computers that is controlled by apen and recognizes handwritten words and notations. Theseportable, pen-based computers are widely considered to havethe potential to increase the appetite for computers, byautomating work now done with pen and paper.</LP><TEXT>   Go, a closely held Foster City, Calif, company, willintroduce a test version of its notebook software today, butwon't have a final version ready until the fourth quarter ofthis year.   Tandy Corp.'s Grid subsidiary is the only major computermaker now offering such electronic notebooks. Observersbelieve that several other large computer companies,including IBM, will introduce such machines before the end of1991.   In order for Go to become the primary supplier ofoperating software for pen-based machines, it must persuademanufacturers to &quot;bundle&quot; its software with their computers.&quot;We have to sign up&quot; these companies, said William V.Campbell, Go's chief executive officer. &quot;If we have to marketthis to end-users ourselves, then we've failed.&quot;   Even though the market for pen-based computers is in itsinfancy, Go already faces stiff competition from MicrosoftCorp., which is the dominant supplier of operating softwarefor personal computers. Microsoft has a group of 30 engineersworking on its handwriting software and promises to offer itwithin a year.   The two companies are approaching electronic notebooks indifferent ways. To use Go software, a customer will have tobuy all-new applications and a computer costing about $5,000(outfitted with a 386 chip and at least four megabytes ofmemory). But the Go software provides many snazzy featuresthat make its program resemble an actual notebook.Microsoft's software is more cumbersome, but works withexisting applications and less expensive hardware.   Both approaches, however, require users to learn specificways of writing and tapping on the surface of a computerscreen. And neither accepts script.   Manufacturers say it is unlikely they'll side with eitherGo or Microsoft, but instead expect to offer both, lettingcustomers choose. Grid, for instance, is endorsing theapproaches taken by both Go and Microsoft. &quot;Each oneaddresses a different market segment,&quot; said Alan Lefkof,Grid's president.   In the end, the success of the rival approaches may dependon the quality of the applications written for each, Mr.Lefkof said.</TEXT></DOC>
