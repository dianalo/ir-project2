The relative indications and complementary uses of dynamicCT with intravenous contrast agent enhancement, delayed scanning aftercontrast agent injection, CT-guided angiography, US, angiography, andMR imaging are illustrated. The techniques for performing the CT examinationsand statistics regarding accuracy are presented. In the search for focalor diffuse liver disease, dynamic CT is often the first test employed.CT-guided angiography and delayed CT are used when depicting the exactnumber and location of lesions is crucial for surgical planning. US iscommonly used as a directed examination to resolve uncertainties aboutCT results. The indications for angiography are discussed. Preliminarywork with MR imaging suggests its value in detecting focal liver lesionsand specifically in diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. As most methods ofliver imaging have improved, the complexity of diagnostic decision-makinghas also increased. This course is intended to help clarify the approachto focal and diffuse liver diagnosis in specific clinical circumstances.</TEXT></DOC>
