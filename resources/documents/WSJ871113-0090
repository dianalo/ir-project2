On Tuesday, Industry and Commerce Minister Jose Hugo Castello Branco fired the previous board of Cosipa, which is Brazil's third-largest steelmaker and which the government expects will post a loss of $276.5 million this year. The new board, which is expected to be made up of technocrats without strong political ties, will report in three months on how to solve Cosipa's troubles. It is unlikely to discover anything the government doesn't already know.    The minister himself conceded that the government is largely responsible for the company's troubles. Price controls hold revenues below costs for all state-owned steel companies.    &quot;If {the steel mills} were mine, I would close them,&quot; Mr. Castello Branco said. &quot;I don't because there is somebody paying&quot; to keep them open.    The Treasury will have to pay $1 billion to cover losses at the 10 state mills this year because prices are 35% below costs. Mr. Castello Branco is lobbying the Finance Ministry to ease price ceilings.    The government has lifted price controls on many products, but a few industries are still straining under price limits. The local units of Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, which are grouped under the holding company Autolatina, say price curbs will cause them a $300 million loss this year. They are fighting the Finance Ministry in court to be free of the controls.    Cosipa's 15,000 employees produce 3.5 million tons of steel a year, valued at $69 million. One-quarter of the output is exported. Its size makes the steelmaker a coveted political prize.    A government spokesman said political intrigue at the company prompted the board's dismissal. The fired board members had been named to reflect the strength of political parties in the industrial state of Sao Paulo, where Cosipa is based. The official said that fist fights between members of rival parties had broken out at recent board meetings, and that influence peddling became widespread with the approach of local elections next year.    Antonio Maria Claret Reis de Andrade, the dismissed president of Cosipa, asserted that the bureaucracy in Brasilia, the nation's capital, alone is responsible for the steelmaker's problems. He told a Sao Paulo newspaper that the company's 1987 budget didn't reach him until Oct. 5. The budget forecasts 180% inflation for Brazil this year, even though prices increased 253% through October. </TEXT></DOC>
