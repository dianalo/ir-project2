In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Chicago, Rolling Meadows, Ill.-based Staley said Drexel officials contacted the company beginning last Nov. 3 and soon were proposing talks to structure a leveraged buyout of Staley. The pressure tactics by Drexel, a New York-based investment banking concern, included threatening to have Staley management &quot;thrown out,&quot; Staley said in the suit.    Staley also alleged that Drexel controlled a stake of more than 5% in Staley but didn't file the required 13D statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Staley also charged that Drexel thwarted a Staley offering of four million common shares by heavily selling Staley stock that Drexel controlled to damp the market price. Drexel &quot;sold into our offering,&quot; Staley general counsel Robert Scott said in an interview. &quot;It pushed the price down.&quot;    The alleged manipulation forced Staley, which needed to sell stock to retire debt, to offer more expensive convertible preferred shares, the suit said. Staley seeks about $70 million from Drexel in compensatory damages, which Mr. Scott said was the higher cost of the preferred offering, and twice that in punitive damages. The suit charges Drexel's actions were part of a pattern of stock-trading schemes and seeks a trebling of damages under the federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organization law.    A Drexel spokesman said that while Drexel hadn't seen Staley's lawsuit yet, the allegations are &quot;totally without merit.&quot; The lawsuit is &quot;an ill-conceived attempt to capitalize on the current climate&quot; of the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal, Drexel said.    As previously reported, Drexel is the subject of both SEC and grand jury investigations stemming from the scandal. Drexel and some of its officials, including Michael Milken, head of Drexel's junk-bond operation in Beverly Hills, Calif., have been subpoenaed. The investment banking firm has said it hasn't committed any wrongdoing.    Drexel said that Staley management &quot;repeatedly&quot; had been assured by &quot;senior Drexel officials that our firm has no interest in pursuing any course of action which would adversely affect Staley, its management or its shareholders.&quot; And when Staley filed the suit yesterday, Drexel was in the process of responding to an agreement proposed by Staley &quot;which they indicated would conclude the matter to their satisfaction,&quot; Drexel said.    Drexel called Staley's filing of the suit &quot;surprising, unwarranted and highly suspect,&quot; and said it &quot;intends to vigorously defend the suit and fully expects to prevail.&quot;    Mr. Scott said that discussions with Drexel to resolve the dispute continued &quot;up until today,&quot; but he wouldn't describe the discussions or say why Staley filed the suit now.    The suit contains detailed accounts of conversations Staley's chief financial officer, Robert Hoffman, alleges he had with Drexel officials. His account, if borne out in court, would offer a rare inside glimpse of how Drexel allegedly threatened to put a company into play.    Several of the conversations recounted in the suit occurred before Nov. 14, when Mr. Boesky's settlement with federal officials on insider-trading charges was announced.    &quot;It is very important for us to sit down and talk before you do something that hurts me and before I do something that hurts you,&quot; Mr. Hoffman quotes an official in Drexel's Beverly Hills junk-bond office, James Dahl, as telling him on Nov. 11. Drexel didn't want Staley to proceed with a stock offering, the suit charges. &quot;You would hurt us by doing the equity offering,&quot; the suit quotes Mr. Dahl as saying.    It continues: &quot;When (Mr. Hoffman) asked what Drexel would do to hurt Staley, Dahl made it clear that Drexel would have to protect its interests and if the offering went forward 'the next thing that happens is someone files a 13D at $40 a share and management is thrown out.'&quot; A 13D is a Securities and Exchange Commission filing required of investors who hold 5% or more of a company's shares.    Mr. Scott, Staley's general counsel, said that he was involved in keeping records of the Drexel conversations from the beginning and that the company's outside lawyers got involved shortly after. They weren't necessarily monitored with a lawsuit in mind, Mr. Scott said. &quot;But we recognized these conversations were not ordinary business-type conversations and it would be significant to have a fairly complete record of what was said by whom. And we do.&quot;    The suit charges that Drexel began acquiring Staley stock in late October of last year, and on Nov. 3, James Bode of Drexel called Mr. Hoffman and said Drexel was interested in &quot;establishing an investment-banking relationship with Staley.&quot; Two days later, the suit says, Mr. Bode called again and said &quot;our guys&quot; in Drexel's Los Angeles office had acquired a &quot;large position.&quot;    The next day, according to the suit, Mr. Dahl told Mr. Hoffman by phone that Drexel owned 1.5 million Staley shares and &quot;wanted to be Staley's investment banker.&quot;    Staley's stock was trading in unusually heavy volume and on Nov. 11, the suit says, by phone &quot;Dahl admitted that Drexel had not yet filed a 13D statement as required . . . and Dahl told (Mr. Hoffman) that 13D statements were 'bad for business.'&quot;    It was during that conversation, the suit charges, that Mr. Dahl said Drexel wanted to discuss a leveraged buyout of Staley. &quot;We can take Staley private in 48 hours,&quot; the suit quotes Mr. Dahl as saying. Later that day Mr. Dahl, the suit says, invited Staley management to New York &quot;to look over the numbers on a leveraged buyout&quot; with Drexel Chief Executive Officer Fred Joseph, Drexel Executive Vice President Herbert Bachelor and Alan Greditor, a stock analyst at Drexel.    It was during that conversation, the suit alleges, that Mr. Dahl warned Mr. Hoffman to sit down and talk before &quot; . . . I do something that hurts you.&quot;    Two days later, Nov. 13, Staley filed with the SEC to offer four million common shares, with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and First Boston Corp. as lead underwriters, which the suit claims angered Drexel. Mr. Dahl asked Mr. Hoffman by phone that day, the suit says, &quot;how and when the pricing of the new issue would be handled because Dahl told (Mr. Hoffman) he would 'hate to see Drexel have to sell into the stock offering.'&quot;    Staley charges in the suit that Drexel proceeded to do just that -- forcing Staley to withdraw the stock offering as it watched its share price tumble in heavy volume.    About the same time, the suit alleges, Mr. Dahl contacted a big shareholder of Staley and said that Drexel owned or controlled six million Staley shares and invited the holder to &quot;join our group.&quot; The big holder wasn't named, though members of the Staley family hold close to 10% of the company's shares.    Staley implies in the suit that the Nov. 14 announcement of Mr. Boesky's insider-trading settlement and subsequent reports of Drexel being investigated appeared to cool Drexel interest. On about Nov. 24, the suit says, Mr. Dahl again contacted the big Staley holder and stated that Drexel and its group might &quot;make another pass at Staley; however, Dahl stated that it would not happen until 'sometime next year.'&quot;    Mr. Dahl couldn't be reached for comment.    As reported in this newspaper, government investigators are focusing on secret records and other evidence suggesting that Mr. Boesky and Drexel officials engaged in a wide-ranging illegal scheme to profit from corporate takeovers, according to people familiar with the government's probe of the Boesky scandal.    The government is examining evidence suggesting that Mr. Boesky and Drexel officials may have had an arrangement to unlawfully conceal ownership of large blocks of stock, agreed to share profits from their holdings and concealed evidence of their relationship, these sources said.    The government is also examining evidence suggesting an arrangement between Mr. Boesky and Drexel involving illegal &quot;parking&quot; of large stock positions to conceal the true ownership of the stock, the people familiar with the case said.    Staley isn't the only company to complain about Drexel's tactics. Green Tree Acceptance Inc., a Minneapolis housing and finance company, sued Drexel in 1985 in federal court, alleging that Drexel put Green Tree &quot;in play&quot; by placing a substantial block of Green Tree stock with Drexel clients who have financed hostile bids. They included Saul Steinberg, head of Reliance Financial Services Corp., which amassed a 15% stake in Green Tree and later sold it back to the company for a $26 million gain.    Drexel has called the dispute a &quot;misunderstanding,&quot; and Reliance has said its purchases of stock were an investment. As reported, a Green Tree official said that SEC investigators have contacted the company, seeking information about the lawsuit. </TEXT></DOC>
