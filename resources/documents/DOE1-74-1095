<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-1095 </DOCNO><TEXT>The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations establishes procedures and criteriafor the issuance of licenses to receive title to, own, acquire, deliver,receive, possess, use, and initially transfer special nuclear material;and establishes and provides for the terms and conditions upon whichthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will issue such licenses. Section70.22 of the regulations, ''Contents of Applications'', requires thatapplications for licenses contain proposed procedures to avoid accidentalconditions of criticality. These procedures are elements of a nuclearcriticality safety program for operations with fissionable materialsat fuels and materials facilities (i.e., fuel cycle facilities otherthan nuclear reactors) in which there exists a potential for criticalityaccidents. To assist the applicant in providing specific informationneeded for a nuclear criticality safety program in a license application,the NRC has issued regulatory guides. The NRC requirements for nuclearcriticality safety include organizational, administrative, and technicalrequirements. For purely technical matters on nuclear criticality safetythese guides endorse national standards. Others provide guidance on thestandard format and content of license applications, guidance on evaluatingradiological consequences of criticality accidents, or guidance for dealingwith other radiation safety issues.</TEXT></DOC>
