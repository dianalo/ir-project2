 Offices are treated like factories, where productioncan be measured and output is to exceed input.andP;  With theautomation tools now available, the office can be more than that.andO;It can be an extension of the mind, rather than the body.andP;  Theoffice can exist anywhere it is needed, it does not have to takeform within walls and under ceilings.andP;  Offices should be involvedin managing and creating information, rather than being concernedabout the shape that the information takes.andP;

that the modern office is essentially an&quot;information factory.&quot;andM;The pervasiveness of this illusion is evident in the words we use to talkabout offices and office technology--terms such as &quot;work flow&quot; and &quot;officeautomation.&quot;andP;  It also shows up in the techniques companies use to enhance theperformance and reduce the cost of the white-collar work force.andP;  Approachessuch as quality circles, work rationalization, and massive investment in newtechnology are mostly lifted directly from the factory floor.andP;  Unfortunately,few of them have worked.andM;Despite untold hundreds of billions of dollars in capital investment--notonly in PCs but in all types of technology, as well as fads such asmanagement retraining and &quot;new approaches&quot; to office planning anddesign--office performance may actually be getting worse rather than better.andM;&quot;If someone landed from Mars--or, more to the point, from Tokyo--he'dconclude that the computer has had essentially no impact on our white-collarproductivity,&quot; said Robert Solow, vice chairman of a Massachusetts Instituteof Technology blue-ribbon panel on American competitiveness, in a 1987Fortune magazine interview.andM;In a world in which intellectual agility is rapidly becoming the key tolong-term competitive advantage, most efforts to upgrade office productivityhave been cosmetic rather than structural.andP;  Such incremental improvements,which focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of today'soffices, are akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.andP;  They willnot lead to the breakthroughs that are required for an enterprise to remain amajor player in the &quot;post-industrial&quot; age.andM;I don't mean to underestimate the impact of computers.andP;  The PC, inparticular, has revolutionized the way many of us think about work.andP;  And Idon't mean to deprecate the efforts of conscientious and hardworking MISdirectors, human resources executives, and facility managers, or theirequally hardworking staffs.andP;  Many companies are becoming increasinglysensitive and responsive to human resources issues such as paternity leave,child care, the needs of two-career families, and employee &quot;wellness.&quot;andP;  It'smore than reasonable for people to expect to be able to work in a safe,aesthetically pleasing, and ergonomically supportive office environment.andM;Nevertheless, radical improvement will require a change in the basic conceptof the office itself--from a technology-oriented to a people-orientedenterprise.andP;  It will take a concerted effort to look for innovative ways touse technology to help perform the intellectual work needed for anorganization to achieve its objectives.andP;  I've coined the word &quot;officing&quot; todescribe this new approach (see sidebar).andM;We Are What We KnowandM;It's very difficult to picture an office radically different from the ones weknow today.andP;  But it's relatively easy to envision wall-sized,three-dimensional video displays, voice- or even mind-activated PCs,holographic videoconferencing, &quot;organic&quot; computers that interface directlywith our nervous systems--even twenty-first-century office workers runningaround in silver jumpsuits.andM;Despite changes in color, fabrics, and technological tools, however, mostcurrent offices would look remarkably familiar to a time-traveling managerfrom the 1870s.andP;  And the &quot;office of the future&quot; we imagine today is generallyjust another ordinary office equipped with better devices.andM;The problem is, &quot;We are what we know,&quot; as social historian James Burkepointed out in The Day the Universe Changed.andP;  Before Galileo perfected thetelescope, in the early 1600s, for example, people &quot;knew&quot; that God had placedthe earth at the center of the universe and that the sun, the planets, andthe stars revolved about the heavens on crystal spheres.andP;  The day-to-dayevidence of their senses reinforced the potent combination of conventionalwisdom and religious dogma.andM;Similarly, today's managers &quot;know,&quot; based on theoffice-as-information-factory analogy, that the office productivity solutionlies in finding ways either to increase productivity of individual workersthrough mechanization or to eliminate the workers altogether throughautomation.andM;In this case, management's day-to-day experience with the success ofmechanization and automation on the farm and in the factory reinforcesconventional wisdom and academic and consulting dogma about the strategicrelationship between information technology and competitiveness.andP;  It was onlylogical to assume that these techniques would work equally well in theoffice.andM;So why haven't they?andP;  I believe that the answer to this question is almostembarrassingly simple: automating the office was an attempt to solve thewrong problem.andP;  The analogy was inappropriate.andP;  Offices are not likefactories and farms.andM;Unfortunately, inappropriate analogies, like comfortable old sweaters, oftenprove extremely difficult to throw away--even when they no longer fit.andM;Offices, like factories, have floors, walls, and ceilings.andP;  But thesimilarities just about end there.andP;  While consultants prattle about the&quot;flow&quot; of office work and the &quot;productivity&quot; of white-collar workers, anoffice is not an information factory or, in fact, a factory of any sort.andP;  Thestrategies that worked so well in the fields and on the shop floor becomelargely irrelevant when transferred to the office.andM;And even if the analogy was useful at first, it no longer fits reality.andP;  Theconceptual framework for the modern office was laid down a little more than100 years ago, during the Industrial Revolution.andP;  As a child of that time,the modern office reflects a technocratic way of thinking about therelationships between labor, management, and machines.andP;  Both the form andfunction of the modern office reflect a completely outdated set oftechnological constraints, especially on telecommunications andtransportation.andM;Technology has changed the rules.andP;  For the first time, it's possible to&quot;office&quot; with total time and space independence--something unimaginable evena decade or two ago.andP;  Managers in the late 1870s had only begun to experimentwith Bell's electrical toy, as the telephone was then known, and could nothave conceived of the facsimile machines, videoconferencing, and corporatejets taken for granted by today's harried executives.andP;  Today, we stand on thethreshold of the age of the virtual office--an office that exists only whenand where it's needed, and for only as long as it's needed.andM;But managers still refuse to abandon the factory analogy.andP;  In addition tocausing stagnation or a decline in productivity, this refusal has led manycompanies to spend years and millions of dollars on ways to measure officeproductivity in production terms--the efficiency with which input getsconverted into output.andP;  Multibillio-dollar corporations have sunk to suchabsurdities as requiring executives to record how they spend their time in15-minute increments, counting the keystrokes of word processing operators,and trying to cost-justify individual PCs or even individual softwarepackages.andM;As long as managers continue to believe in this chimera, the main result willbe to make American office workers as happy as clams at high tide.andP;  They'llsit at their orgonomic workstations, use state-of-the-art PCs to pump numbersthrough their high-tech electronic spreadsheets, and solemnly attend weeklyquality-circle meetings--while their companies co quietly down the tubes.andM;Clearly, we have forgotten (if we ever really knew) why offices exist in thefirst place.andP;  Contrary to the way it sometimes appears, the office wasn'tinvented to fulfill some deeply felt social need--even if the office partyand office romance now loom large on many people's social calendars.andM;We have offices because one person couldn't do all the intellectual worknecessary to run even a modest enterprise in the nineteenth century, letalone a huge corporation today.andM;As an intellectual rather than a technocratic enterprise, the purpose of theoffice is not to produce &quot;information&quot; but to acquire new knowledge that canhelp the organization accomplish its physical goals.andP;  The office is anexpansion of the mind, not the body.andP;  Like the brain, it is, in effect, aknowledge machine: it does not produce anything itself, but controls andsupports actions that take place elsewhere.andM;InfomaniaandM;Back in 1597, Francis Bacon observed that &quot;knowledge is power.&quot; He didn'tsay, &quot;information is power,&quot; but it's easy to lose sight of the differencehere in the &quot;information age.&quot;andM;Information, rather than being something tangible that can be managed, issimply what chemists would call an &quot;intermediate product&quot; in the ongoingintellectual process known as information processing.andP;  It can best be thoughtof as an experience, based on the interpretation of sensory data or the&quot;facts&quot; our minds fabricate, that answers some immediate question about theworld around us.andP;  What was that movement in the bushes?andP;  Was it a dangeroussnake or simply a shifting branch?andP;  What was that noise that woke us from asound sleep?andP;  Was it a burglar breaking into the house or just the family catgetting into mischief?andM;All living organisms process information.andP;  However, human being havedeveloped the unique ability to retain information, turning experience intoknowledge.andP;  Just as important, we can pass it on to others, via language, inreal time--synchronously--or store it for later referral and transfer itasynchronously.andM;The things we normally think of as information--the memos, letters,management reports, voice-mail messages, and other items that clog ourdesks--are really just artifacts or by-products of information processingitself.andP;  These &quot;symbol buckets&quot; are nothing more than extremely cleverconventions for sharing ideas and experiences (knowledge) expressed in theform of tokens--words, pictures, and other symbols--that have been givenagreed-upon meanings.andP;  although symbol buckets may carry useful information,they are not, in and of themselves, information.andM;We cannot assume that just because technology delivers a piece of paperfaster, it will have any information utility, or that the recipient canextract the information it contains any faster, if at all.andM;Most companies continue to devote the bulk of their technology dollars tomanaging symbol buckets.andP;  They don't realize that they must deliver theinformation held in the symbol buckets.andP;  They key to increase competitivenesslies in effectively managing information processing itself, at both theindividual level and the organizational level.andM;This crucial difference has far-reaching implications for how companiesshould structure their technology management, and for the role thatindividual technologies such as PCs should play in an enterprise's overallinformation processing strategy.andM;Looking AheadandM;People have great difficulty imagining a future radically different from thepresent, especially if they do not see a place for themselves in that future.andO;But that may not stop it from arriving on schedule.andM;The legend of Digital Equipment Corporation founder Ken Olsen's refusal toaccept the concept of personal computers is a classic example.andP;  As the storyis told in PC user groups around the country, Olsen at one point went so faras to actually forbid the use of the term &quot;personal computer&quot; within hiscompany.andP;  Of course, his ban had little effect, and even DEC has finally hadto face facts: the company recently announced that it has arranged with Tandyto jointly market PCs.andM;Rather than ignore the challenges of the future, management must free itselffrom traditional constraints--including the lure of large physical structuressuch as office buildings--and focus its intellectual and economic capital onmore critical issues.andM;First, companies must develop an organizational information processingstrategy that can cope with a constantly changing--not merelyuncertain-business environment.andM;Second, they must learn to managenent the variables that effect theefficiency of organization-level information proceesing.andM;Third, they must manage the company's organizational knowledge.andM;There is no question that technology has an important role to play in helpingmanagement address these issues.andP;  In most cases, however, that is not itsrole today.andP;  for example, we know instinctively that people have differentworking styles.andP;  If our goal is to take full advantage of our intellectualresources--at both the organizationl and the national level--we can no longerafford to constrain human intellect in the anachronistic straitjacket we call&quot;the office.&quot;andM;Designing a more pleasant traditional office merely results in a moreconfortable straitjacket, and supporting office workers with expensivetechnology without changing the structure they work in adds up to a waste ofmoney.andP;  Technology must be used to open up the options of when, where, andhow people do intellectual work, as individuals and in groups.andM;The Role of the PCandM;Personal computers will be the &quot;window&quot; on the new office--although probablynot in their present incarnation.andP;  As conventional offices fade from thescene, the PC will become an integral component of a seamless infrastructureof technology that makes officing as easy at home, in a car, on an airplane,or at the beach as it would be in an office setting.andM;But PCs are just one part of what must amount to a totally new way ofthinking about the role of technology in human and organizational informationprocessing.andP;  Even more profound changes in the way companies approachtechnology management are likely.andP;  As the pendulum begins to swing from atechnocratic view of the office to a humanistic view, we will have to seesubstantive changes in both the composition and the role of technologymanagement organizations.andM;Reaching for the goal of a truly optimized office will inevitably blur thedistinct structures of management information systems, facilities management,and human resources management.andP;  Because information processing is primarilya behavioral rather than a technical phenomenon, the newly integratedorganization will need to expand or restaff with experts from such domains ascognitive psychology, psychobiology, and psycholinguistics--areas ofspecialization not currently represented even in the most progressivecompanies.andM;At the same time, the focus of the organization will have to shift fromacquiring and running the technological artifacts of information processingtoward helping the company manage the organizational ethos.andP;  Hardware andsoftware are peripheral; the company's value systems, which affect theefficiency and effectiveness of organization-level information processing,are the real key to increased competitiveness and office &quot;productivity.&quot;andM;Admittedly, this scenario will not be easily realized.andP;  If there are nooffice buildings, where will we put the millions of office workers?andP;  Whatabout all the people whose livelihoods depend on office buildings, fromleasing agents to cleaning contractors?andP;  And what about those of us who makeour living, in one wy or another, by working with office technology as itexists today?andM;Nevertheless, the postindustrial economy will slowly force companies to ridthemselves of unnecessary office constraints, such as the arbitrarily definedwork day.andP;  One of the first things to be eliminated will most likely be whatI call &quot;the elementary school theory of management&quot;--the mentality that says,&quot;I can't really measure what you do as a knowledge worker, but as long asyou're here from nine to five, at least I can be certain that you'reworking.&quot;andM;We're Not AloneandM;Finding innovative ways to leverage an organization's intellectual potentialis not a problem restricted to the United States.andP;  Other countries,especially Japan, recognize that their positions in the postindustrial worldmay well be determined by their ability to tape their full intellectualpotential.andM;The Japanese, for example, have embarked on a national initiative to upgradeevery square foot of office space in the country, a project that will involvemajor investments in office technology.andM;If all the Japanese do is repeat the mistakes we have made, I won't beworried.andP;  However, the simple act of focusing national attention on the roleof the office is likely to lead corporate Japan to ask questions thatcorporate America hasn't even thought of yet.andP;  For example: If we didn't haveoffices as we know them today, what (if anything) would we invent to taketheir place?andP;  What role should PCs play?andP;  Should they continue to be used toextend the individual's capability or to enable new forms of organization?andO;Exactly what should a PC really be doing?andM;Personal computers are clearly valuable tools and, like telephones, shouldnot have to justify their existence on a project-by-project basis.andP;  PCs cando a lot more than just shuffle paper, important as that may seem in theshort run.andP;  the trick is to understand how they can extend and enhance theprocess of officing.andM;The country that answers these questions will make a quantum leap inintellectual productivity, gaining a valuable competitive advantage.andP;  U.S.andO;industry has already watched this happen to other countries in manufacturing.andO;We can't afford to watch it happen again.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
