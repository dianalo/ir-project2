<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0696 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of authors are interested both in approximate and exact solutionsof the Einstein-Maxwell field equations representing black holes immersedin external magnetic fields. The flux is studied of the magnetic fieldacross the horizon of these objects within the framework of exact models.This will make it possible to elucidate interaction between the gravitationalfield of the black hole and the external magnetic field. Moreover, inone of the most important models of active galactic nuclei (Blandfordand Znajek, 1977) one needs field lines to thread the horizon in orderto extract the hole rotational energy and transfer it to the surroundingplasma. Therefore, the knowledge of the behaviour of magnetic fluxesacross the horizons may help in understanding extragalactic sources withactive nuclei and jets. Starting from the exact solutions representingblack holes in an external magnetic field, several graphs are presentedelucidating the dependence of the flux upon parameters characterizingspacetime. The solutions obtained by Ernst's magnetizing technique aremainly studied. (author). 9 figs., 57 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
