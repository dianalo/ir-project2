For thetaandless;10{sup 0} a powerlaw with slope similar to that found from optical studies of galaxiesis a good fit. The amplitude of this correlation function is a factorof 2 or so lower than that for galaxies as a whole. The amplitude ofthe angular correlation function on angular scales 25{sup 0} - 35{sup0} is significantly higher at {vert_bar}{vert_bar}30{sup 0} than expectedfor a Poissonian distribution. The physical scale of this enhanced clusteringis 80-110(50/H{sub 0})Mpc. However, the clustering amplitude on thisscale is entirely due to sources at bandgt;30{sup 0}: at bandless;-30{sup 0} thereappears to be significant voiding on this scale.</TEXT></DOC>
