This initial rate schedule is an Electric Service Contractbetween RRRC and Commonwealth Edison (the Agreement) and has been designatedRRRC Rate Schedule No. 1.RRRC has given notice that the Facility will be a refuse-derived fuel (RDF)waste-to-energy small power production facility with a net electric powerproduction capacity of 41 megawatts. The Facility will be a qualifyingfacility (QF) under sections 201 and 210 of the Public Utility RegulatoryPolicies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and an application for certification as aqualifying small power production facility was filed on February 23, 1989,in FERC Docket No. QF89-156-000. While the Commission has not yet actedon the application for QF certification, once certified as a QF the Facility,RRRC states that the Facility will be exempt from regulation under thePublic Utility Holding Company Act from certain state laws and regulations,but will remain subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the FederalPower Act.RRRC requests waiver of the Commission's rule requiring that rate schedulesbe filed not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred-twenty(120) days prior to the date on which service is to commence under an initialrate schedule. This requirement is intended to prevent the use of staledata in developing the test period for cost-of-service based rates. Section35.3 of the Commission's regulations allows the Commission to waive thenotice period in appropriate circumstances. Since the rates are formularates based on the buyer's costs, and do not involve RRRC's costs for aparticular test period, this requirement is not applicable.RRRC also seeks waiver of the Commission's regulations regarding cost-of-servicedocumentation. The Commission has recognized, in other cases,\1\<NOTE/> that the cost-of-service data requirements contained in andSection;35.12(b)(5)of its regulatins are irrelevant insofar as they would require a smallpower producer to substantiate its cost-of-service. RRRC requests thiswaiver on the grounds that this information is not relevant because ratesare based on the buyer's costs, and are not dependent upon the seller'scosts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\<T3>See Wheelabrator Frye, Inc.,</T3> Docket Nos. EL82-7-000 and EL82-12-000,19 FERC andpara;61,266 (1982).RRRC seeks waiver of the Commission's regulations regarding the UniformSystem of Accounts prescribed for public utilities and licensees subjectto the provisions of the Federal Power Act specified by 18 CFR Parts 101and 104. Since rates are initially based upon the buyer's costs, this informationand the need for uniformity in the seller's accounting systems are unnecessary.Moreover, this requirement imposes a substantial hardship and an undueburden upon RRRC as it requires more detailed accounting than RRRC wouldotherwise undertake.RRRC seeks waiver of the Commission's regulations regarding certain accountsand reports required by 18 CFR Parts 41, 50, and 141. RRRC seeks this waiveron the basis that such information and reports are irrelevant because therates under the contract are not to be determined by RRRC's costs. Therefore,it is not necessary to protect the public in general by requiring strictcompliance with these sections.RRRC also petitions the Commission to waive Commission rules that the Commissionhas previously determined not to be necessarily applicable to qualifyingfacilities such as the RRRC Facility. These include regulations regardingaccounting practices, reporting requirements, annual charges, dispositionsof property and consolidations, securities issuances and assumptions ofliability and the holding of interlocking directorate positions as theymay apply to a RFD waste-to energy facility.<T3>Comment date:</T3> April 17, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphE at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">7.
