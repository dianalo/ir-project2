The European Space Agency also announced plans for two morelaunches in May.   Technicians said France's Telecom 1C and the American SpacenetIIIR-Geostar, which includes facilities for The Associated Press,were thrust into a geographically stationary orbit Friday nightabout 20 minutes after liftoff from this South American jungle base.   Officials called the launch perfect.   Arianespace, the space agency's commercial arm, said Saturdaytwo more launches were planned for May, one a demonstration flightof the more powerful Ariane 4 rocket. Arianespace is now the West'sonly active commercial satellite launcher with America'sspace-shuttle program grounded.   The Ariane 3 rocket ignited normally four minutes afterblastoff, officials said. Ignition was the cause of failed Arianelaunches in September 1982, September 1985 and May 1986.   The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded formore than a year.   Technicians said Friday's satellites obtained an altitute of22,554 miles.   The French satellite is to begin moving into its definitivegeostationary orbit Sunday, 37 hours after the launch, afterigniting its own engine, Arianespace said.   Spacenet IIIR-Geostar is to start moving into a permanent orbitabout 90 hours after the liftoff, the company said.   GTE Spacenet, the European firm's first American client, hasused the Ariane to launch five satellites, losing one in aSeptember 1985 failure.   Jerry Waylan, GTE Spacenet chief, said this was the firstAmerican telecommunications satellite to be launched in two years.   The satellite, with an expected lifetime of 10 years, weighed2,674 pounds before liftoff and 1,562 pounds in orbit.   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by AP are to providethe New York-based news cooperative with domestic satellitedelivery services.   The French Telecom IC, replacing one that broke down Jan. 15, isto be used for telephones, radio and television transmissions andmilitary communications.   Arianespace said it has orders for 41 more satellite launchings,valued at $2.29 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
