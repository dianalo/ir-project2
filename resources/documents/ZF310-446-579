Just look at thenumber and variety of opinions I got from your January 15, 1991, issue:andM;(1) Bill Machrone's editorial: &quot;[The PS/1] came in one box.andP;  My five-year-oldput it together.... PCs can't be too small or too powerful.andP;  And they're notmutually exclusive anymore.&quot;andM;(2) William Zachmann's editorial: &quot;The PS/1 follows the PCjr intoobscurity.... The PS/1 repeats the basic mistakes of the PCjr, minus thefunny keyboard.&quot;andM;(3) &quot;The Best of 1990&quot; cover story: &quot;While there are clearly better values,the PS/1 delivers enough performance, value, and ease of use to avoid anydanger of suffering the same fate as the PCjr.&quot;andM;(4) After Hours column: &quot;Whether a given shopper should buy a PS/1 depends onhow little machine he is prepared to live with, and how important he deemsthe IBM label.&quot;andM;So what is it, gang? Thumbs up or thumbs down?andM;Chris NiggelerandM;San Jose, CaliforniaandM;Obviously we have mixed impressions about the PS/1.andP;  While we tend to agreeon what's necessary for business computing, the editors at PC Magazine shareno single opinion on the many variations of the &quot;home computing&quot; theme.-Ed.andM;BEST OF 1990?andM;I do not understand how you could include Microsoft Windows3.0 as a finalistin the Technical Excellence category (January 15, 1990).andP;  Perhaps you meantMarketing Hype Excellence.andM;Where is the technical excellence in a system based on an obsolete real-modeoperating system? Did any of the reviewers note that Windows must switch toreal mode for every DOS call, has no overlapped I/O, offers lousyinterapplication protection, and is a nightmare for programmers? Have any ofthe reviewers ever written a serious Windows program?andM;How about an article on the shortcomings of Windows 3.0 before too many MISmanagers bet their companies on it?andM;Wayne JohnsonandM;Becker, MinnesotaandM;DVORAK OR BUSTandM;John C. Dvorak is to be commended on his January 15, 1991, article, CD-ROM:Still a Bust.&quot;andM;The fact is, no search-and-retrieval software standards exist for CD-ROM.andO;But Mr. Dvorak's comments about CD-ROM may be extrapolated to include thesoftware industry.andP;  Replace  &quot;CD-ROM&quot; with software application&quot; and hisarticle still rings true.andM;Of course, a medium that keeps the publishing cost of 1,200 books to just $2is going to have its growing pains, and a lack of software standards is oneprice of CD-ROM's puberty.andP;  Fortunately, similar problems have been avoidedon the hardware side through wide acceptance of ISO-9660.andM;All things considered, 1991 may very well be &quot;the year of CD-ROM.&quot;andM;Larry ShillerandM;Parsippany, New JerseyandM;I mostly agree with Mr. Dvorak, but his January 15, 1991, rail against Intelin &quot;Inside Track&quot; was enough to make me write to you.andM;Okay, I know I'm just a &quot;dumb Canuck&quot; in a plaid shirt, sitting on a snowbankup here, but could someone explain to me why everyone is so pissed off atIntel? They are just doing what America is all about! They are greedilytrying to maintain a monopoly on a key (major money-making) component of thecomputer world.andP;  Isn't that what America is for?andM;Intel is in the business of making money.andP;  I'm sure its charter doesn't listthe corporation as a nonprofit charity organization.andP;  It may not be great foranyone else, but it sure is best for Intel if it keeps all the money foritself.andM;Of course, we all agree that the world might be a better place if intelshared its 386/486/x86 design with AMD and if Lotus quit bitching and letQuattro use slash menus.andP;  We might all gain from the lower prices andproliferation of software with a common interface.andP;  But if no one got to hangonto what they developed (and get fat and happy due to their greed), then whois going to bother creating the next breakthrough?andM;Don PennerandM;Winnipeg, Manitoba, CanadaandM;LOTUS IS TAKING OVER THEandM;WORLD? !andP;  Gus Venditto is blind to what's really happening when he says &quot;Theramifications aren't major&quot; concerning Lotus's acquisition of Samna(Pipeline, January 15,1991).andM;Lotus's acquisition of Samna is earth shaking news to anyone who has beenpaying attention to Lotus's recent activities.andP;  I think Lotus will soonannounce the availability of a supercharged Microsoft Windows-compatible,integrated software package.andP;  If it doesn't make the mistake other developershave made and overprice the package, Lotus may rule the PC software world.andM;Vincent ChesnoandM;Coraopolis, PennsylvaniaandM;THE POWER OF PREDICTIONandM;William Zachmann's prediction that IBM is going to suffer a dreadful 1991(&quot;1991 Predictions,&quot; January 15, 1991) made me ponder an awesome power that Ipossess.andP;  I have only to sell IBM short on the stock market and overnight itwill go bonkers in an upward direction.andM;Trevelyan BeardandM;Markham, Ontario, CanadaandM;BUYING BY MAILandM;Your response to Jean Kreiling (Letters, December 25, 1990) about MicroExpress cited the vendor's response but failed to address the legal issues.andM;According to federal law, a mail-order vendor may not charge against a creditcard for a purchase until a shipment has been made, although a partialshipment may be enough to satisfy the requirement.andP;  Furthermore, regardlessof the form of payment, a mail-order vendor is required to offer a refund ifunable to fill the order within the period promised or the period specifiedby law.andM;In a situation like this, a letter to your bank refusing to pay the charge,with an explanation of the reason and supporting details, will do wonders.andO;Be sure to include a list of all relevant telephone calls and names.andP;  By lawthe bank cannot charge you interest, and if your claim is valid, they willput pressure on the vendor.andP;  You can also complain to the FTC and USPS.andM;Seymour J. MetzandM;Annandale, VirginiaandM;DIAL 900-PORN?andM;I needed to call a company to get some technical help and called the numberlisted in my manual.andP;  The company told me I must call a 900 number.andP;  I was atwork and 900 numbers are blocked, but I don't give up that easily.andP;  I went tothe cafeteria, dialed the 900 number on the pay phone, punched in my creditcard number and was greeted with &quot;Your call can not be completed as dialed.andO;Stay on the line if you need operator assistance.&quot;andM;Well, guess what? I was told I can't charge a call to a 900 number.andP;  Why?&quot; Iasked the operator.andP;  &quot;Well, you know the kind of calls made to 900 numbers.&quot;andO;I tried to explain.andP;  &quot;I'm not a pervert! I'm calling about a computerproblem.&quot;andM;Now I'm back to using the older version of the software.andM;Robert M. AllenandM;West Springfield, MassachusettsandM;THE QUALITY OF COMPUTER BOOKSandM;This is a good one for a tirade by Dvorak the topic is very serious though:the quality of computer books.andP;  You wind up buying a ton of books, and thevast majority are just a minor rewrite of the manuals.andP;  It is embarrassing.andO;I see so many books that consist of: 25 percent on how to turn the computeron, 25 percent on what DOS is, 25 percent on a rehash of the manual, and 25percent about simplistic programming concepts addressed to a moron that hasnot had any exposure to any programming at all.andM;There are exceptions, but the majority of books are hopelessly bad.andO;Ultimately publishers will pay for this because people are becoming soskeptical about the quality of these books, and aren't buying them.andM;Rogier F. van VlissingenandM;South Norwalk, ConnecticutandM;WHERE'S THE COLOR?andM;Beige, beige, beige! I don't know about you, but I am utterly sick of beige.andO;Monitor cases, computer cases, keyboards are all beige! Macs, IBMS, clones, Rdoesn't matter what you get, it's going to be beige.andP;  What's so sacred aboutthe damned color, anyway!?andM;Think about it for a minute.andP;  A computer is basically a piece of furniture.andO;Now, what other piece of furniture do you spend two or three thousand dollarson and have absolutely no choice of color? How many people don't buy acomputer because it would ruin their decor? I wonder.andP;  Seriously, I think thecomputer manufacturers are missing a bet in not providing some color choices.andO;After all, one can find similarly equipped systems, at about the same price,from any number of clone companies.andP;  Offering some color choices would helpmake a company's machine unique from the competition's, and perhaps sway thecustomer into buying their machine rather than the other guy's.andM;I'd be willing to pay a bit extra for a color of my choice, and I'd say a lotof other people would, too.andP;  So, wake up computer makers! Here's a chance tomake a buck !andP;  Paul N. WeisslerandM;Colorado Springs, ColoradoandM;MICE ARE JUST FINE FOR MEandM;After reading the comments about the Appoint Mouse Pen, I felt you shouldhear from someone who has owned one for nine months.andP;  At first, I thought theidea was great.andP;  It took up little space on my desk, it wouldn't get lostunder all my papers, and so on.andP;  After a couple months my opinion started tochange.andM;It takes almost twice as many steps to move the cursor, click something, andthen type in something as it does with a mouse.andP;  The main problem is that youmust pick up the mouse pen every time you use it.andP;  When I got Windows, myopinion changed dramatically.andP;  On a mouse, when you press a button, it ispressed against the desk.andP;  With the mouse pen, you must put a finger on theback side of the pen.andP;  My finger invariably ends up on a corner, so after 10minutes of use my finger is beginning to get sore.andM;It may work well for laptops where it isn't used much, but it shouldn't beused as a main mouse.andM;Frank PowellandM;Arroyo Grande, California</TEXT></DOC>
