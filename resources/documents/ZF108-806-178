Blumstein, seems destinedto be opposed by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committeemajority, who are expected to issue a report stating that hisbackground as a lawyer and economist is inappropriate for theposition.andP;  Administrators of the past have been legal andeconomics experts, but the committee has determined that theseareas are not as crucial to job performance as a knowledge oftechnology procurement, government operations, and automated dataprocessing.andP;  OIRA is the branch of the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) that sets federal policy on information resourcesmanagement.andP;  The OIRA is undergoing a reauthorization process inCongress that is complicated by the Bush administration's desireto keep the OMB from having to disclose its rule-makingactivities.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     United States.

Jay Plager left to become a federaljudge.andM;Nomination Sent UpandM;Darman had said earlier the White House would not nominate a newadministrator until Congress reauthorized the office.andP;  But as thereauthorization process dragged on, administration officials finally sent upthe nomination.andM;Top Governmental Affairs staff members have been meeting with OMB officialsand some agreement is expected, staff members said.andP;  Formerly, staff memberssaid Glenn had agreed to disagree with Darman on OIRA.andP;  Both the House andSenate have been at odds with the administration over disclosing informationabout OMB rulemaking activities.andP;  The Senate bill approved by the committeewould mandate a disclosure policy.andM;The House counterpart excludes the disclosure section.andP;  But House activity onOIRA has deadlocked because of a broken agreement House leaders thought theyhad with Darman.andP;  The OIRA reauthorization now has a low priority in theHouse Government Operations Committee, a staff members said.andM;The administration has floated several ideas, including disbanding OIRA.andP;  Butthe most recent suggestions include outlining a disclosure policy througheither an OMB circular or an executive order.andP;  A draft of the circularproposal drew criticism from Glenn, who said it offered less than existingdisclosure agreements provided and approving it would be a major concessionfor the Senate.andM;A former OMB official said the players are growing farther apart.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
