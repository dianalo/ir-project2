The useof these materials is of interest in two areas: 1) In the blanket andfirst wall design, where (ferromagnetic) martensitic steels offer improvementsover austenitic, in terms of higher thermal conductivity and lower thermalexpansion, thermal creep and void swelling. The ferromagnetism is anunwanted side effect. 2) In the toroidal field coil design, where ferromagneticinserts may be considered to reduce the toroidal field coil ripple atthe plasma boundary. The effect of ferromagnetism has to be investigatedfrom the viewpoints of toroidal and poloidal field, since although thefield levels are such that the steel is saturated, the direction of themagnetisation vector can change with the time varying fields. The codesGFUN and TOSCA have been used with simplified geometric representationsto analyse the various aspects of the effects of the ferromagnetics.</TEXT></DOC>
