The variation in lung cancer ratesamong communes within the country suggests that indoor combustion ofsmoky coal may be the prime determinant of lung cancer. To characterizethe air in Xuan Wei homes, samples of the air particles and semivolatileorganics were collected from homes located in communes with differentlung cancer rates. Samples collected in the commune in which the lungcancer rate is high and smoky coal is the predominant fuel containedhigh concentrations of submicron particles with high organic content;organic extracts of these samples were mutagenic. Samples from homesin a wood-burning commune, which has a low lung cancer rate, consistedmostly of large particles of lower organic content and mutagenicity.The smoky coal sample was also a more potent skin tumor initiator comparedto the wood or smokeless coal sample and was a mouse skin carcinogen.</TEXT></DOC>
