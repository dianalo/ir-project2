In the November 18, 1987, issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 44276), the FAA published a final rulerevising and reorganizing 14 CFR Part 139. The final rule was effectiveon January 1, 1988. Subsequent to the issuance of the final rule, numerousairports have petitioned the FAA for exemption from various requirementsof the rule. Three new requirements have generated the overwhelming percentageof the petitions. The petitions for exemption have requested additionaltime to permit the airports an opportunity to come into compliance. TheFAA has concluded that the exemption process is an unnecessarily burdensomeand inefficient approach for providing an adequate transition period. Thisdocument serves to address the problem by amending the final rule publishedNovember 18, 1987, to extend the compliance dates for these three requirementsto permit airports an opportunity to come into compliance without the needfor obtaining an exemption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Jose Roman, Jr., Safety andCompliance Division (AAS-300), Office of Airport Standards, 800 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267-8724.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On November 18, 1987, the FAA publisheda final rule revising and reorganizing 14 CFR Part 139. The final ruleresulted in numerous changes in the requirements applicable to certificatedairports. Subsequent to the issuance of the final rule, the FAA has receivedin excess of 600 petitions for exemption. The majority of petitions involverunway marking and lighting (14 CFR 139.311), training of personnel inemergency medical care (14 CFR 139.319(j)(4)), or training of fueling personnelin fire safety (14 CFR 139.321(b)(6)).With respect to the marking and lighting provision, the FAA recognizesthat immediate compliance with the new requirements by all airports isnot possible. Indeed, the preamble in the notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) stated that the ``FAA would work with airports whose lighting andmarking systems do not comply with current standards to bring them intocompliance over a 4 to 5-year period.'' 50 FR 43097. However, at the NPRMstage the FAA believed that ``the vast majority of affected airports havethese lighting and marking systems.'' 50 FR 43097. It was envisioned thatthose airports not in compliance would be granted exemptions pending completionof the needed airport improvements over the next several years.It is now clear that a significant number of airports do not meet the markingand lighting requirements in at least some fashion, thus making the exemptionapproach to noncompliance burdensome and inefficient for both airportsand the FAA. Indeed, given the large number of airports requiring exemptions,general rulemaking is a far more appropriate administrative approach. Theextension of the compliance date will permit airports to come into compliancewithin the time period identified in the NPRM and without the burden ofthe exemption process. The amended rule makes clear, however, that markingand lighting systems that are on the airport must be maintained. Similarly, the limited extension in the compliance date for the two trainingrequirements is designed to better transition from the previous rule requirementsto those of the current rule. While there is already substantial compliancewith the training provisions, scheduling and completing the training forthe remaining individuals will take several more months. Neither the FAAnor the commenters to the NPRM fully appreciated the logistical implicationsof these otherwise straightforward requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice and Public Procedure </ITAG>Since this final rule merely extends the compliance date for three provisionsof a regulation recently issued after an extended rulemaking process, addressesissues fully explored in the process, and imposes no additional burdenson any person, the FAA has determined that notice and public procedureare not necessary. Furthermore, since this final rule involves a situationrequiring immediate action to relieve the burden on airports to petitionfor exemptions, notice and public procedure are also impractical. Thisfinal rule shall become effective in less than 30 days to avoid the burdenthat would otherwise be imposed on airports and the FAA by adherence tothe exemption process. <ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Statement </ITAG>This final rule affects only domestic airports subject to Part 139 of theFederal aviation regulations. Accordingly, this rule has no impact on tradeopportunities for U.S. firms doing business in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe States, on the relationship between the national Government and theStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of Government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The FAA has determined this final rule will not impose any costs on airportoperators. The FAA has not quantified any specific economic benefits fromthe final rule, although it is expected that the rule will save airportoperators some time and expense by eliminating the need to petition forexemptions. For this reason, it has been determined that the expected economicimpact of the amendment is so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluationis not warranted. Therefore, the FAA has determined that this final ruleinvolves a regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291. TheFAA has determined also that this final rule is not significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Itis certified that this final rule would not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 139 </ITAG>Air carriers, Aircraft, Airports, Airplanes, Air Safety, Aviation Safety,Air Transportation, Helicopters, Heliports, Rotocraft, Safety, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendment </ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, 14 CFR Part 139 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 139_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
