It is now the lawthat drivers must be polite.   Aggression in the form of dangerously high speeds and daredevilmaneuvers accounted for many of the 400,000 injury-causing accidentsin West Germany in 1988, according to police and automobile clubstatistics.   The revised rules that took effect Sunday include a prohibitionagainst blinking headlights to pressure slower drivers to move tothe right, as well as a finder's-keeper's policy on parking spaces,which are at a premium in most cities.   A nation renowned for its fast cars and frustrated drivers, WestGermany has more traffic volume than any nation in Europe. It alsosuffers the continent's highest injury-accident rate.   Fatal accidents _ about 8,000 last year _ have been considerablyreduced in the past 10 years. But the number of collisions rose bymore than 10 percent in 1988 and moving violations were up by 28percent over 1987.   Recent mild winters, coupled with cheaper gas prices due to astrong West German mark, have intensified the problem of too manycars traveling too fast on too few roads.   ``The problem is that drivers are becoming increasinglyaggressive on the highways, borrowing the idea from Americans thattime is money,'' said Andreas Zimmermann, regional traffic divisionchief for ADAC, West Germany's largest automobile club.   The new ``Intelligent Use of the Streets'' legislation aims todiffuse some of the aggression by punishing drivers for infractionsthat until now have been considered impolite but not illegal.   The more than 100 minor revisions to the 1971 driving code areseen as a token of consolation for the outnumbered advocates ofspeed limits and environmental protection.   Public opinion polls have shown the vast majority of West Germandrivers favor a retention of the status quo _ no speed limits atall. They have rallied under the cry of ``Free Ways for Free Folks''and through the powerful car industry and auto club lobbies foughtoff all attempts to cool their engines.   More than 1 million of the 28 million registered automobiles arecapable of sustained speeds exceeding 125 mph, according to theADAC, which is the world's second-largest auto club after the AAA inthe United States.   Some politicians of the opposition Social Democrat party and theenvironmentalist Greens annually have put forward measures toestablish a limit of 60 mph, but have been defeated by the dominantChristian Democrats and members of their own parties concerned aboutvoter reaction.   Short of forcing drivers to slow down, the new laws require themto cease the widespread practice of using headlights and blinkers topressure slower cars into moving out of their way.   Tailgating also has been outlawed, as well as passing too closely_ a favorite punishment meted out by drivers miffed at having tochange lanes to get by a slower car.   Truck drivers hauling dangerous cargo must pull into the nearestparking turnout when visibility drops to less than 165 feet becauseof fog, snow or rain.   Vehicles long have been prohibited from passing on the right, butthe code revision makes the offense one that can damage a driver'srecord and eventually lead to license revocation.   Many drivers argue that despite the law, German practice on athree-lane autobahn dictates that slower cars use the right lane,fast cars the left and the middle lane is to remain open for passingfrom both sides.   Some of the more controversial and less-enforceable rules governparking, including a requirement that the first car in a line ofautos circling for a free space has claim to the next open spot _even if the driver has already passed it by.   Drivers are also required to activate their warning blinkers assoon as they see a traffic backup on an autobahn, with the aim ofpreventing the kind of multiple smashups that often occur in the fogor when backups are obscured by a rise or turn in the road.   Dieter Schulte, parliamentary secretary for the federal TransportMinistry and a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian DemocratParty, said more than $230 million will be invested in improvingsigns and roads as part of the new legal changes.   ``Not only will these changes reduce the hazards from backups andpassing, but they will also save energy and reduce environmentalproblems like noise and exhaust,'' Schulte said.   Others argue, however, that drivers will begin to depend on thenew signs to warn them of road-blocking hazards ahead and drive evenfaster when no warnings are visible.   ``With the best intentions, the changes may have negativeconsequences for safety and the environment,'' Zimmerman conceded.   Some of the new rules, irreverently referred to as ``the PoliteDriving Act,'' are virtually unenforceable, such as requiringdrivers to alert one another about hazards they themselves may notreact to in time.   But the regulations are expected to deter some of the aggressivepractices because violations will count against a driver's record.   West German drivers are not required to renew their licenses oncethey have passed initial tests and a two-year probation period,unless they've accumulated a considerable series of citations in ashort period.   The point system differentiates between character offenses andaccidents, ascribing a higher penalty for drunken driving than forkilling a pedestrian in a crosswalk.   Points also are recorded for offenses such as misuse of blinkersor following too closely, previously punishable only by fines.   The success of the new system will depend heavily on the drivingpublic, which to date has shown little interest or understanding ofthe revisions.   Drivers questioned at gas stations over the New Year's weekendexpressed amusement over the effort to get them to mind theirmanners.   ``Sure I'll be polite,'' promised one BMW driver who gave hisname only as Rudolf. ``As long as the trucks and the timid stay outof the left lane.''</TEXT></DOC>
