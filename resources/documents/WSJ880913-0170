Rather, they say, a combination of fundamental and structural factors should support Japan's market despite the deluge of nearly 6.5 trillion yen ($48.63 billion) of new equity and convertible-bond issues that have come or are coming to market in the six months ending Sept. 30. Moreover, analysts predict that such issues will total as much as 13.5 trillion yen in the next six months if current conditions hold.    &quot;The Tokyo market is very tough,&quot; says Keiji Yasuda, an analyst at New Japan Securities Co. &quot;Everyone always underestimates its potential, but it always manages to survive.&quot;    Mr. Yasuda forecasts that Japanese issues of convertible bonds, which are debt instruments that usually can be swapped for stock later, will total 10 trillion yen for the current fiscal year, ending next March 31. Another 10 trillion yen in planned direct stock offerings -- half of which will come from one government offer of shares in Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Co. -- could put &quot;some downward pressure&quot; on Japan's stock market, Mr. Yasuda says.    But a surging supply of investment money should enable the market to absorb the new issues, he and other analysts say.    High property prices and relaxed lending terms helped prop up share prices before the Ministry of Finance tightened property-based borrowing this year. At about the same time, though, the government eliminated tax advantages on some savings accounts, and some money from those accounts is presumed to have been moved into shares as a result.    In addition, Japan recently redeemed 2.5 trillion yen of government bonds and didn't soak up the cash with new bond issues, and a government proposal for further tax changes could release 10 trillion to 15 trillion yen for investment.    &quot;There is no shortage of Japanese money,&quot; an analyst at Nomura Securities Co. says. &quot;I don't think there can be too much supply (of new stocks or bonds) right now.&quot;    Some, however, worry that the rush of issues this year could bode badly for next year.    &quot;It looks like the latter part of 1989 could be more dangerous,&quot; says Yasumasa Mitani, president of Tokyo Associated Capital Ltd., a fund-management firm. &quot;If it is not controlled, there could be problems.&quot;    But certain features of the Japanese system help to ensure that such troubles rarely arise. Most existing companies that offer shares already have substantial numbers of &quot;core&quot; holders who automatically take up their allotments of new shares, leaving only a relatively small amount for public sale. In addition, it's common here for an underwriter who is having difficulty placing shares at the offering price to hold on to the shares and then seek ways to boost the stock price so that the shares can be profitably unloaded.    In a reflection of this system's apparent effectiveness, Hank Sawa, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., wrote in a recent paper on capital offerings that he had been unable to find &quot;a situation where an oversupply situation has created a major correction phase.&quot;    The system works better at home than abroad, however. In late July, the overseas market for Japanese equity-warrant bonds, or interest-paying instruments that give investors the right to purchase shares in the issuing company at a set price, wallowed to a halt in a morass of new issues. The saturation of that market is partly to blame for the heavy emphasis now on domestic fund-raising.    The huge volume of stock and bond issues is predominantly a fund-raising exercise by banks, manufacturers and a few state-backed companies.    Japan's banks, which hold nine of the top 10 positions in world rankings in terms of assets, are under pressure to increase their capital bases to meet standards recently recommended by the Bank of International Settlements and adopted by most Western countries. The central recommendation calls for banks to achieve a capital-to-assets ratio of 8% by March 1993.    Most Japanese banks are below that level now and have turned to the capital markets for help. James Capel Pacific Ltd. estimates that in the current quarter, Japanese banks are raising about two trillion yen through rights issues, equity offerings, domestic convertible bonds and a handful of offshore issues. This month, for example, Sumitomo Bank plans to raise 165 billion yen, while Industrial Bank of Japan hopes to raise the equivalent of $2.1 billion.    Manufacturers, meanwhile, are accumulating funds for capital investment at home and abroad. The strength of the yen makes domestically raised funds extremely attractive, analysts say.    And then there is NTT, the world's most heavily capitalized company, which is in the midst of privatization. The government hopes to raise around five trillion yen in October through its third public sale of a 12.5% stake in the telecommunications giant. Some other government-backed companies, including the Japan Railway group, also are contemplating public share offerings. </TEXT></DOC>
