(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of a failed credit union has beenportrayed by authorities as a reverse Robin Hood who divertedmillions of dollars of deposits from the poor to fund a lavishlifestyle of parties and private jets.   Lawrence E. King Jr., a flamboyant Republican Party activist whoonce ran up a $1.1 million American Express bill, was releasedFriday on his own recognizance after being charged in a 40-countfederal indictment accusing him of fraud and violating income taxlaw.   King's wife, Alice, who faces 12 federal counts, also wasreleased on her own recognizance by U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf.Both were scheduled for Tuesday court appearances.   Last November, the National Credit Union Administration shutdown King's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union and filed acivil lawsuit, saying that as much as $39 million was missing fromFranklin coffers.   The victims were not only neighborhood depositors who used thecredit union for their small accounts, but businesses and evenconvents in North Dakota and South Dakota who invested.   King, 44, owned restaurants and bars in Omaha and had a homenear embassy row in Washington, D.C. He chartered jets andlimousines. He wore expensive clothing and jewelry, including a$69,000 watch seized when a judge ordered King's property intoreceivership.   King declined to comment on the indictment Friday, but hasdenied any wrongdoing in the past. Calls to his residence Saturdaywere forwarded to his catering business and an employee there saidhe was out and declined to take a message.   Friends and associates describe King as a generous man whodonated to community projects and AIDS research.   King, who is black and a one-time Democrat, said he became aRepublican because blacks need ``to be on both sides of thebargaining table.''   He sang the National Anthem at the 1984 Republican NationalConvention in Dallas and threw extravagant parties, including oneat the Southfork Ranch where the television show ``Dallas'' isfilmed. Last year, King spent $100,000 for parties at the GOPConvention in New Orleans, according to court documents.   Government documents allege he used credit union funds to makemore than $40,000 in political contributions to Republicancandidates and causes.   King's affluent lifestyle caused some high-ranking NebraskaRepublicans, including Gov. Kay Orr, to keep their distance.   Mrs. Orr received a $2,250 campaign donation from King, butlater balked at his offer to be the host of a fund-raiser.   ``We couldn't figure out where his money was coming from,'' saidGeorge Spence, Mrs. Orr's finance director.   In a November letter to King, assistant U.S. attorney ThomasThalken said the grand jury investigation into Franklin's collapseincluded allegations of false entries, mail fraud, wire fraud andfederal tax violations.   Thalken said the probe also centered on violations involving theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. RICO containscriminal and civil provisions aimed at racketeering and organizedcrime.   Court documents said King sold millions of dollars of purportedcertificates of deposit at above-market rates.   He ``committed a long series of fraudulent, dishonest andillegal acts by which funds were transferred from (the creditunion) to himself,'' other people and entities, the governmentalleged.   During a 13-month period in 1987 and 1988, he made $32,120 inRepublican campaign contributions, according to governmentdocuments.   The biggest single contribution, $25,350, was to Citizens ForAmerica, a lobbying group for President Reagan's economic anddefense policies.   Documents show King also gave money to Americans for Bush, JackKemp for president, Robert Dole for president, the RepublicanNational Committee and the National Black Republican Council.   Because deposits are insured up to $100,000, most neighborhoodinvestors have been reimbursed by the government. But some groupsexceeded the $100,000 limit.   Charities held about $8 million in Franklin deposits,investigators said.   The Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary inAberdeen, S.D., had $2 million in the credit union. Other investorsincluded the American Baptist Church USA and the PresbyterianChurch USA.   The indictment opened Friday named King in 40 counts on chargesof conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, credit unionembezzlement, making false entries in credit union records andfiling false tax returns.   The indictment accused Mrs. King in 12 counts for allegedconspiracy, wire fraud and bank fraud.   If convicted on all counts, King faces up to 200 years in prisonand fines totaling $10 million. Mrs. King, 42, faces up to 60 yearsin prison and $3 million in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
