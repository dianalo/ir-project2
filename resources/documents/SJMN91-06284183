Health care is the right issue. But next year's sprintfor the presidency is the wrong race. Recent public opinion polls suggest thathealth care will barely ripple the surface of the 1992 presidential campaign.;  Not so in congressional races, where the absence of action on health-careproblems could unseat some Republican incumbents and may sink more than a fewGOP challengers.;   That's the view of Robert Blendon, chairman of the schoolof public health at Harvard University and perhaps the nation's most seriousstudent of public opinion on health issues.;   Blendon says Americans remainconcerned about health care. In a Gallup survey in June, nine out of 10persons interviewed said there was a &quot;health-care crisis&quot; in the UnitedStates. That poll also found that 85 percent of those questioned said thehealth-care system in the United States needs &quot;reforming and change.&quot; Only 14percent said it works &quot;pretty well the way it is.&quot;;   And the proportion ofAmericans with negative views of the health-care system has increased steadilyin the past 10 years, he says.;   Yet Blendon says health care remains a&quot;third-tier issue&quot; to most Americans -- well behind the first-tier issues ofthe economy and foreign policy, the issues that largely make or breakpresidential campaigns. It also is somewhat eclipsed by crime and drugs.;   AnABC News poll conducted in September found that only 1 percent of thoseinterviewed said that health care or the health care system was the mostimportant problem facing the country today. Leading the list of the people'sbiggest worries: economic problems and drugs.;   Part of the reason healthcare languishes on the third tier of issues is that most Americans are quitepleased with the quality of care they receive.;   Their concerns about healthcare lie elsewhere, Blendon says. &quot;The cost of that care, the instability andthe inequity of it is what drives Americans nuts.&quot;;   A survey of registeredvoters in June for the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that the publichas few quibbles with the quality of health care or its availability. The topcomplaint was high cost, which was named by 55 percent of those questioned asthe most important health-care issue facing the country.;   Another 32 percentsaid &quot;people not covered by any insurance&quot; was their biggest concern.;   Infact, in Gallup's June survey, 27 percent of those questioned said they &quot;didnot have money enough to pay for medical or health care&quot; in the previous 12months. Blendon says the number of people without any form of health insurancehas gone up by 25 percent in recent years.;   In other ways, the issue remainsa sleeping giant in national politics. That's because the people most likelyto be hurt by rising costs and declining health benefits are the middle class,who cast most of the ballots in national elections.;   &quot;The growing concernnow is not for (health care for) the poor and the homeless,&quot; Blendon says.&quot;The middle class is now threatened. &quot;;   And people are looking to thefederal government for relief. The Journal-NBC poll found that most Americansbelieve it is the federal government's responsibility to solve the high costof health care.;   All of that may combine to threaten congressionalRepublicans, who are an endangered species. Bush, Blendon argues, caneffectively deflect public dissatisfaction with his Desert Shield victory inthe gulf. And the president will benefit from what most predict will be animproving economy.;   Congressional Republicans, by contrast, have nowhere togo and nowhere to hide.;   &quot;In the presidential campaign, the economy andforeign policy will dominate and Bush probably is going to skate in,&quot; Blendonsays. &quot;The political problem is on the congressional level. People expect thegovernment to do something about these problems, and House Republicans fearthey are going to be left with no plan. And a number of them could be hurt.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD MORIN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911010  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  734  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 10, 199100284183,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
