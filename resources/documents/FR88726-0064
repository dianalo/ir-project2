The Under Secretary ofEnergy has submitted the rates to the Commission for confirmation, approvaland implementation on a final basis for the same period.The System rate schedules would increase annual revenue by $2,814,800 from$87,971,100 to $90,785,900 to recover projected increases in annual operatingexpenses for the generation and transmission facilities. This would beaccomplished primarily through an increase in the base energy charge forsales of Federal hydroelectric power and energy, although a slight decreasein the basic monthly demand charges and the combination of a decrease andan increase in the conditions of service charges for 69 kV, and load centeror below 69kV deliveries respectively, contribute as well. Significantlyincreased charges for the use of SWPA's transmission system to deliverynon-Federal power and energy are indicated and new alternate energy-basedtransmission rates have been designed for delivery of economy energy. Further,a credit, specifically designed for each customer, will apply against thepurchased power adder component of the rate schedules to refund excessreveneus collected in the purchased power deferral account during recentyears of favorable water conditions. This credit is intended to effectivelyequalize each customers average purchased power adder cost and should reducethe deferral account to a level needed to cover system purchases underone year of critical water conditions. The credit will offset the effectsof the overall rate increase for the vast majority of customers, exceptthose to which the purchased power adder does not apply, who will experiencean increase of about one percent power adder does not apply, who will experiencean increase of about one percent in their basic 1200 hour peaking service.The total rate increase is derived about 20 percent from the basic peakingand firm service, about 45 percent from non-firm energy sales, and about35 percent from facilities and transmission service charges. The proposalalso includes a provision for SWPA's Administrator, at his discretion,to adjust the purchased power adder annually up to $0.0005 per kilowatthouras necessary, with notification to the Commission.<T3>Comment date:</T3> August 1, 1988, in accordance with Standard ParagraphE at the end of this document.<ITAG tagnum="84">15.
