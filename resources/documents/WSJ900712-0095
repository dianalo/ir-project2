Delta's pilots arerepresented by the Air Line Pilots Association.   Atlanta-based Delta has been negotiating this proposedcontract with pilots for 18 months, and the main dispute isover a lower wage rate in effect for newer pilots. Pilots saythey want an end to the scale, which is known as a &quot;B-scale&quot;and has been in effect since 1985, when the airline industrywas racked by fare cuts.</LP><TEXT>   Although the pilots' contract was up for renegotiation inMarch 1989, under airline labor law the provisions of acontract are binding until a new one is signed. Delta hadasked for a mediator's help in negotiating the currentpilots' contract. &quot;We're very optimistic it's going to beresolved,&quot; said a Delta spokesman, adding: &quot;We think havingoutside help will help move things along.&quot;   Officials of Delta's pilots' union disagreed. &quot;We aredisappointed that management could not handle this familyissue privately without involving external parties,&quot; saidCapt. Jim Gray of the pilots' union.   Under terms of a recent Delta proposal to its pilots, acopy of which was obtained by this newspaper, the company isoffering wage increases of about 11% to pilots with six to 12years' experience, and 34% to 51% to first officers with twoto five years at Delta. Although that would narrow thediscrepancy between what &quot;A-scale&quot; and &quot;B-scale&quot; pilots arepaid, it wouldn't eliminate the two-tiered system.   Delta refused to comment on the details of any offers. Apilots' spokesman said a more recent offer contained slightlydifferent numbers.   The only union among Delta's employees is the pilots'union; the airline has never been struck.</TEXT></DOC>
