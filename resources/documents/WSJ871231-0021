Mr. Noir said the dollar's fall, which he put at 25% against major European currencies in the past year, has wiped out Airbus's profit margin. &quot;As a result, the planes that will be delivered in the coming months will be sold at a loss because they were billed in dollars and their cost price hasn't fallen by 25%,&quot; he said.    Mr. Noir said governments won't provide any special aid for the consortium because of the weak dollar. &quot;It is up to the four industrial partners of the group to face up to their operational and financial difficulties,&quot; he said.    Airbus groups Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, Aerospatiale S.A. of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    U.S. aircraft builders Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. already believe that Airbus sells its planes at below cost in order to gain market share. Even without any dollar-related aid, the consortium receives large government subsidies that the U.S. contends permit it to sell planes at uneconomically low prices. </TEXT></DOC>
