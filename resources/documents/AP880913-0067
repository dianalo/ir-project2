Avionics upgrades for their fighter aircraft and radarprograms, some torpoedo programs. We're discussing some otherprograms with them, all within the constraints of our normaltechnology transfer program,'' Carlucci said on NBC's ``Today''program.   Asked if that means the transfer of military technology to Chinawill occur, Carlucci responded:   ``The technology transfer is moving forward, yes.''   Transfer of some technology to China had been held up in thepast because of concern about sales of weapons to Iran, althoughthose sales were denied by the Chinese.   Carlucci, who returned Sunday from a five-day trip to China fordiscussions with defense officials there, said that afterdiscussing the problem with the Chinese he is ``quite satisfiedthat they will do nothing to destabilize'' the Middle East.   But he declined to expound, saying the Chinese prefer thatdetails not be discussed in public.   Carlucci said a decision was also reached in principle to allowthe Chinese to launch three American satellites, ``but there is notechnology transfer involved.''</TEXT></DOC>
