Foster, U.S. Department of Labor, OccupationalSafety and Health Administration, Room N3647, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210 (Telephone: 202-523-8148.).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On January 31, 1989, OSHA publisheda proposed new standard on electric power generation, transmission, anddistribution and a proposed revision of the existing regulations on electricalprotective equipment for general industry (54 FR 4974). Interested partieswere given until May 1, 1989, to submit written comments and to file objectionsto the proposal and request hearing. The deadline for submitting writtencomments was subsequently extended to June 1, 1989 (54 FR 18546).<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues</ITAG>OSHA received 77 comments, including one hearing request that was receivedby the May 1 deadline. After this date, five additional requests for ahearing were received. Therefore, OSHA has scheduled a public hearing tobegin on November 28, 1989. The hearing is being held to examine all issuesraised by the proposal, including the following issues, which were gleanedfrom the comments:1. <T3>Grandfathering. </T3>Many commenters requested some form of ``grandfathering''(or exemption) for existing electrical protective equipment from the requirementsproposed in andSection; 1910.137 and for existing power generation, transmission,and distribution installations from andSection; 1910.269. In their objections,andSection; 1910.269(h)(4) on step bolts and manhole steps, (u)(1) and (v)(3)on access and working space about electric equipment, and (u)(4) and (v)(4)on guarding of live parts were specifically mentioned as requirements thatwould force extensive modification of existing installations. Public commentis requested on the issue of which requirements cannot be met by existingequipment and installations. Specific instances of non-compliance and alternativesthat provide safety equivalent to the provision in question should be cited,along with cost estimates of bringing equipment and installations intocompliance with the proposal and the suggested alternatives.2. <T3>Performance-oriented requirements. </T3>One of the hearing requestsobjected to the lack of performance language in some of the proposed regulations.Public comment is invited on the issue of whether any of the proposal'srequirements are too specification oriented. Commenters should providealternative language that will provide flexibility but that will also equallyprotect employees and be enforceable. Since the proposal is based, in largepart, on various national consensus standards, suggested alternatives tothe proposed requirements should be accompanied by evidence demonstratingthat they are equivalent to or more effective in promoting the safety ofemployees than the corresponding provisions contained in the proposal.3. <T3>Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis. </T3>Some comments questionedthe validity of the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis. They claimedthat OSHA did not include the cost of bringing certain installations, suchas steps on poles and towers, into compliance with the proposed requirements.Public comment is invited on the issue of whether or not the PreliminaryRegulatory Impact Analysis fully accounts for all the costs and benefitsassociated with the proposal. Additionally, information regarding the changesin costs and benefits associated with any suggested changes to the proposal(e.g., in response to any of the issues in this notice) is welcome andwill enable the Agency to assess the impact of the final regulations fully.For example, if a comment suggests elimination of a requirement, the commentershould also estimate the cost savings and decrease in benefits associatedwith the removal of the provision.4. <T3>Scope of the standard. </T3>Many of the comments addressed the scopeof proposed andSection; 1910.269. The preamble to the proposal had requestedcomments on the issue of whether or not power generation, transmission,and distribution installations not under the exclusive control of an electricutility should be covered. Comments were received supporting both sidesof this issue, but additional public comment is requested. Specifically,advocates of a ``utility-only'' standard should submit evidence that utilityinstallations and the hazards associated with these installations are trulyunique. They should also justify why OSHA should not cover work performedon similar installations not under the exclusive control of electric utilities.Commenters who support extending the scope of the standard should submitinformation demonstrating the presence of the hazards of electric powergeneration, transmission, and distribution work and should submit accidentand cost information with respect to non-utility installations.Additionally, one of the hearing requests objected to the manner in whichnon-electrical hazards were covered in proposed andSection; 1910.269. Therefore,public comment is also requested on the issue of whether or not the non-electricalhazards addressed by the standard are unique to electric power generation,transmission, and distrubtion work and whether or not they should be coveredin andSection; 1910.269.5. <T3>General training. </T3>Proposed andSection;1910.269(a)(2)(i) would requireemployees to be trained in any safety practices that are necessary fortheir safety. Several comments argued that this requirement was unreasonable.Public comment is invited on the issue of whether or not employees shouldreceive such training.6. <T3>Training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). </T3>Proposed andSection;1910.269(b)(1)would require persons trained in CPR and first aid to be available forpersons working on or with energized electric lines or equipment. Nearlyall the comments received from organizations associated with tree-trimmingoperations opposed the application of andSection;1910.269(b)(1) to line-clearancetree-trimming work. Additionally, other commenters questioned the practicalityof the 4-minute maximum response time for fixed work locations proposedin andSection; 1910.269(b)(1)(i)(B). Public comment is invited on the issuesof whether or not CPR training is necessary for line-clearance tree trimmersand on whether the 4-minute response time is reasonable and necessary.7. <T3>Job briefings. </T3>Paragraph (c) of proposed andSection;1910.269 wouldrequire job briefings to be conducted before the start of work. Some commentsopposed this requirement; others suggested that it be applied to employeesworking alone; and still others suggested that the application of thisrequirement be limited to field work or to electrical work only. Publiccomment is invited on the issues of whether or not the proposed job briefingrequirements are appropriate and of what alternatives would provide equivalentprotection to employees.8. <T3>Lockout and tagging. </T3>Many of the comments received in responseto the proposal addressed the lockout and tagging provisions containedin andSection;1910.269(d). Some of the comments suggested that the standardbe consistent with the generic lockout/tagout standard proposed on April29, 1988 (53 FR 15496). Others objected to the proposal's recognition oftagging alone as a protective measure, while the electric utility industrygroups argued that utilities had excellent ``tagout'' systems that shouldnot be altered by the standard. These commenters offered suggested changesto the language contained in several of the provisions proposed in andSection;1910.269(d).For example, it was recommended that paragraph (d)(7)(iii) be revised toallow an authorized employee to remove locks or tags from energy isolatingdevices without restriction. Public comment is invited on the issue ofwhether or not the lockout and tagging provisions of proposed andSection;1910.269(d)are appropriate. Accident records demonstrating the presence or absenceof hazards under existing lockout and tagging programs should also be submitted.9. <T3>Enclosed spaces. </T3>Several interested parties commented on proposedandSection;1910.269(e) on enclosed spaces. Specifically, they objected tothe provisions of paragraph (e)(2), which would require a determinationto be made as to the presence of any hazardous temperature, pressure, oratmosphere, and to paragraph (e)(7), which would require the atmosphereof an enclosed space to be tested for the presence of flammable gases andvapors. Public comment is requested on the issue of whether or not theprovisions on enclosed space are neessary and reasonable as proposed.10. <T3>Fall protection. </T3>Paragraph (g)(2)(v) of andSection;1910.269 proposesthat employees climbing wood poles without steps use fall protection equipmentand that employees working more than 4 feet above the ground on poles,towers, trees, and structures be provided with fall protection. Many commentsobjecting to these provisions were received. It was claimed that fall protectionwas not always practical at heights of less than 10 feet, and that it wasmore hazardous for employees to climb poles with safety straps than forthem to climb poles without this protection. (Although protection was notproposed for climbing trees, treetrimming contractors objected to its usefor employees climbing trees). Public comment is invited on the issue ofwhether or not andSection; 1910.269(g)(2)(v) is reasonable and necessaryas proposed. Comments opposing these provisions should present unique situationsinvolving electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installationsthat preclude the use of fall protection or that present more severe hazardsto an employee using fall protection than to one who is not. Accident statisticsbased on the use and lack of fall protection should also be provided.11. <T3>Live-line tools</T3>. Several comments suggested that live-line tools(hot sticks) be tested every 1 or 2 years, using the guidelines containedin Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard 978-1984,``IEEE Guide for In-Service Maintenance and Electrical Testing of Live-LineTools.'' Test voltages given in the IEEE standard are 75 kV/ft for fiberglassand 50 kV/ft for wood; the test voltages are to be applied for 1 minute.Public comment is invited on the issue of whether or not these recommendationsare reasonable and necessary for employee safety. Costs of performing thetests should also be submitted.12. <T3>Clearance distances</T3>. Paragraph (1) of proposed andSection; 1910.269contains requirements for working on or near exposed energized parts. Twotables (Tables R-6 and R-7) of clearance distances to be maintained fromexposed energized electric circuit parts were included in this paragraph.A similar table, Table R-8, is given in paragraph (q), which applies whenlive-line bare-hand work is being performed. The preamble to the proposalrequested public comment on these tables, and several responses on thisissue were received. Some commenters suggested that OSHA use the clearancetables in the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), American NationalStandard Institute Standard C2-1987. Others urged the Agency to adopt provisionsallowing closer clearance distances if protective gaps were installed onpower lines. A few suggested including a table of clearances from directcurrent lines for live-line bare-hand work. Public comment is invited onthe issues of: (1) whether the distances in the proposal are appropriatefor all types of work or whether the standard should use some other clearancedistances, such as those in the NESC; (2) whether or not OSHA should permitthe use of protective gaps to perform work that could not otherwise beperformed; (3) what types of work necessitate the use of clearances smallerthan those proposed in tables R-6 and R-7; and (4) whether or not a tableof clearances for DC live-line bare-hand work should be incorporated intothe standard.13. <T3>Location of protective grounds. </T3>Paragraph (n)(3) of andSection;1910.269 proposed that protective grounds be located at the work location.OSHA received many comments regarding this provision. It was argued that,in some situations, grounding on each side of the location would providebetter safety for workers on the ground and that it would therefore bemore effective to require whichever method was the safest for the conditionspresent when work was being performed. Public comment is invited on theissue of whether or not andSection; 1910.269(n)(3) is appropriate as proposed.14. <T3>Operation of mechanical equipment near overhead power lines. </T3>ProposedandSection; 1910.269(p)(4)(iii) would require mechanical equipment to beinsulated or considered energized if it could be taken close to overheadpower lines. Some of the commenters objected to this requirement, arguingthat grounding would protect employees if the mechanical equipment contactedthe power line. Others objected to the requirement that equipment connectedto an aerial lift, such as a brush chipper, be considered as energized.They argued that the aerial lift would be insulated and thus would protectemployees on the ground. (Using insulated equipment is one of the optionslisted in the proposal, however.) Public comment is invited on the issuesof: (1) Whether or not grounding mechanical equipment protects employeesfrom electric shock if the equipment contacts a power line and, if so,under what conditions (such as voltage levels) and with what groundingtechniques will employees be fully protected against electric shock, and(2) what other measures will protect employees from the hazards of operationof mechanical equipment near overhead lines. Calculations of voltage impressedon the grounded equipment and descriptions of cases where employees wereprotected by grounding when an actual contact occurred should be submittedby commenters supporting this as an option.15. <T3>Line-clearance tree trimming. </T3>Two provisions contained in proposedandSection; 1910.269(r), line-clearance tree trimming, brought objectionsfrom tree-trimming contractors: (1) Paragraph (r)(1)(viii), which prohibitsline-clearance tree-trimming operations by other than qualified linemenduring storms or other emergency conditions; and (2) paragraph (r)(2)(v),which would require the use of eye and face protection for employees operatingbrush chippers. The contractors argued that line-clearance tree trimmersare fully trained and qualified to perform their work under emergency conditionsand that this has been done safely for many years. They also contendedthat full face protection is not necessary to protect chipper operatorsfrom injury. Public comment is invited on the issue of whether or not thesetwo paragraphs are reasonable and necessary as proposed. Accident informationwould help demonstrate any claims that existing work practices in the tree-trimmingindustry adequately protect employees.16. <T3>Underground installations. </T3>Employee organizations argued thatthe provisions proposed in andSection;1910.269(t), underground installations,would inadequately protect employees. They asserted that additional requirementsare needed with respect to access (e.g., requiring manlifts for emergencyrescue of employees working in manholes more than 8 feet deep), defectivecables, and protection in public work areas. Public comment is invitedon the issue of whether or not proposed andSection; 1910.269(t) would provideadequate protection for employees working on underground installations.17. <T3>Definitions of ``Authorized employee,'' ``Designated employee,'' and``Qualified employee.'' </T3>OSHA received several comments objecting tothe definitions of authorized, designated, and qualified employees. Thedefinitions in the proposal are based on the relevant national consensusstandards (e.g., American National Standard C2, the National ElectricalSafety Code). Public comment is requested on the issue of whether the definitionsin proposed andSection; 1910.269(x) are appropriate. Commenters objectingto the proposed definitions should submit evidence demonstrating that theirproposed suggested alternatives to the consensus-standards-based definitionswould better protect employees.18. <T3>Two-person crews for field work. </T3>Many employer and employee groupscommented on the issue of requiring two employees for work involving energizedelectric equipment. OSHA did not propose such a requirement, but the Agencywill consider evidence supporting or opposing this type of rule. Publiccomment is invited on the issue of what conditions necessitate the presenceof at least two employees. Accidents involving employees working aloneshould be submitted by those supporting a provision requiring two employeesunder certain conditions. Evidence that employees injured while workingalone will receive prompt medical attention, and ways in which the employercan ensure that such attention is available, should be submitted by thoseopposed to such a rule.19. <T3>Fire-resistant protective clothing. </T3>In the preamble to the proposal,OSHA requested comments on the issue of whether or not to require any typeof fire-resistant protective clothing for employees working on electricequipment. While most commenters agreed that certain fabrics, such as polyester,pose a hazard to electrical workers, there was no agreement as to the approachto take to protect employees from this hazard. The Agency is consideringa prohibition of any clothing that would substantially increase the severityof any injury received from arcing electric equipment. Public comment isinvited on the issue of whether or not this approach is necessary and reasonablefor the protection of electrical workers. Evidence should be submitteddemonstrating the hazard of clothing made from materials that are highlyflammable (at least in a relative sense), and suggestions should be madewith respect to which employees need to be protected. OSHA will also considerother approaches to the problem of flammable clothing.20. <T3>Aerial lifts. </T3>A few of the accident descriptions submitted intothe record by OSHA indicated that fatalities are occurring because of theuse of aerial lift buckets to move overhead power lines. The employeesin the aerial lift were killed when the unrestrained line slid up the bucketand contacted the employee (in two cases) or when current passed througha leakage hole in the bottom of the bucket (in the other case). In orderto prevent such accidents, the Agency is considering incorporation of aprohibition on moving or contacting overhead power lines with the bucketof an aerial lift. Public comment is invited on the issue of whether ornot such a prohibition is necessary and appropriate and, if not, on whatother measures can be taken to prevent such accidents in the future.21. <T3>Other issues. </T3>Public comment is invited on any other issue relatedto and within the scope of proposed andSection;andSection; 1910.137 and 1910.269.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>Under section 6(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and 29CFR Part 1911, an opportunity to testify orally concerning the issues raisedin this notice will be provided at an informal public hearing, which willbegin on November 28, 1989, in Washington, DC and on December 5, 1989,in Los Angeles, CA.<T3>Notice of Intention to Appear at Hearing. </T3>All persons desiringto participate at the hearing, including those who previously requestedthat a public hearing be held, must file a notice of intention to appearwith Mr. Tom Hall, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, Room N3647, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC20210. (Telephone: 202-523-8615.) Filing of this notice entitles the participantto present information orally and to question witnesses at the hearing.This notice must be postmarked by September 30, 1989.The notice of intention to appear, which will be available for inspectionand copying at the OSHA Docket Office, must contain the following information:1. The name, address and telephone number of each person to appear;2. At which hearing site the party wishes to testify; 3. The capacity in which the person will appear;4. The approximate amount of time required for the presentation;5. The specific issues that will be addressed;6. A detailed statement of the position that will be taken with respectto each issue addressed; and7. Whether the party intends to submit documentary evidence, and a summaryof the evidence proposed to be adduced at the hearing.<T3>Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the Hearing. </T3>Any partyrequesting more than 10 minutes for a presentation at the hearing, or whowill submit documentary evidence, must provide, in quadruplicate, the completetext of the testimony including all documentary evidence to the OSHA Divisionof Consumer Affairs. This material must be postmarked by September 30,1989. This material will be available for inspection and copying at theOSHA Docket Office. Each submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requestedin the notice of intention to appear. In instances where the informationcontained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested,a more appropriate amount of time will be allocated and the participantwill be notified of that fact.Any party who has not substantially complied with this requirement maybe limited to a 10 minute presentation and may be requested to return forquestioning at a later time. Any party who has not filed a notice of intentionto appear may be allowed to testify, as time permits, at the discretionof the Administrative Law Judge.OSHA emphasizes that the hearing is open to the public, and that interestedpersons are welcome to attend. However, only persons who have filed propernotices of intention to appear at the hearing will be entitled to ask questionsand otherwise participate fully in the hearing.<T3>Conduct and Nature of the Hearing. </T3>The hearing will commence at9:30 a.m. on November 28, 1989, in the Auditorium of the Frances PerkinsDepartment of Labor Building, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20210. At that time any procedural matters relating to the hearing willbe resolved. The nature of the informal rule making hearings to be heldis established in the legislative history of section 6 of the Act and isreflected by the OSHA hearing regulations (see 29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Althoughthe presiding officer is an Administrative Law Judge and questioning byinterested persons is allowed on crucial issues, it is clear that the proceedingshall remain informal and legislative in type. The essential intent isto provide an opportunity for effective oral presentation by interestedpersons which can be carried out expeditiously and in the absence of rigidprocedures which might unduly impede or protract the rulemaking process.The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who willhave all the powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fairinformal hearing as provided in 29 CFR Part 1911, including the powers:1. To regulate the course of the proceedings;2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;3. To confine the presentation to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;4. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriatemeans;5. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit questioning of anywitness and to limit the time for questioning; and6. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonablestated time to receive written information and additional data, views,and arguments from any person who has participated in the oral proceedings.<T3>Written Comments.</T3> Interested persons are invited to submit writtencomments on the issues raised in the proposal and summarized in this notice.Information that has previously been submitted to this rulemaking remainspart of the records and should not be resubmitted. Written comments mustbe postmarked on or before September 30, 1989, and submitted, in quadruplicate,to the Docket Office, Docket No. S-015, U.S. Department of Labor, OccupationalSafety and Health Administration, Room N2634, 200 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20210. The telephone number of the Docket Office is202-523-7894, and its hours of operation are 8:15 am to 4:45 pm Mondaythrough Friday except Federal holidays. Comments of up to 10 pages mayalso be transmitted by facsimile to 202-523-5046 or (for FTS) 8-523-5046provided the original and three copies are sent to the Docket Office thereafter.Additionally, OSHA requests (but does not require) that comments preparedwith word-processing equipment be accompanied by an MS-DOS-formatted, 5.25-inchfloppy disc containing the comments in a Wordperfect or ASCII file. Writtensubmissions must clearly identify the provisions of the proposal whichare addressed and the position taken on each issue.All materials submitted will be available for inspection and copying atthis address. All timely submissions will be part of the record of theproceeding.<T3>Certification of Record and Final Determination After Hearing.</T3>Following the close of the hearing, the presiding Administrative Law Judgewill certify the record of the hearing to the Assistant Secretary of Laborfor Occupational Safety and Health. The Administrative Law Judge does notmake or recommend any decisions as to the content of a final standard.The proposed standard will be reviewed in light of all testimony and writtensubmissions received as part of the record, and a standard will be issued,or a determination will be made not to issue a rule, based on the entirerecord of the proceeding, including the written comments and data receivedfrom the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority</ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of Alan C.
