In addition, compilers for the languages maybe unavailable for a particular computer or may be too expensive. Inthis work, the authors develop a process-oriented simulation language,Simcal, based on standard Pascal and extended to directly incorporatethe simulation primitives found in Simula. They show that the implementationof Simcal only requires a standard Pascal compiler. The combination ofPascal and Simula provides the simulation modeler with a readily accessible,powerful language for writing simulation programs. The language is currentlyimplemented on a micro computer using a Pascal preprocessor.</TEXT></DOC>
