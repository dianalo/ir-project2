<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0257 </DOCNO><TEXT>A high-frequency seismic station has been operating since March, 1987,near Nelson, NV. Records of earthquakes at regional distances from thestation show substantially more energy at frequencies above 10 Hz thanrecords of nuclear tests of comparable magnitude on the Nevda Test Site.This contradicts the predictions made by investigators who have advocatedhigh-frequency monitoring for nuclear test detection and identification.Measuring the slopes of the P/sub g/ velocity spectra between 4 and 30Hz successfully discriminates 11 NTS explosions from 36 earthquakes recordedin the first seven months of operation. The spectral differences mayresult from the respective source depths, with the earthquakes occurringdeeper and in faster material than the explosions. copyright AmericanGeophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
