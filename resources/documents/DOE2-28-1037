He recounts the standoffas the Soviets deployed the SS-20 after the 1972. SALT talks, with theUS to maintaining ground-launched cruise and Pershing missiles in WesternEurope as well as nuclear-capable aircraft. He feels Soviet analystsfailed to take into account Western Europe's considerable influence onUS foreign-policy making, when in 1979 NATO called on Moscow to cancelthe SS-20s. Since it was summer, 1984 before Soviets seriously reactivatedcontacts with their US counterparts, he thinks the precipitating factorwas concern about Reagans Strategic Defense Initiative, which was takingform. Now that the INF treaty is in place, he suggests Moscow may beginto treat Europe as a separate entity.</TEXT></DOC>
