The activities of this Division are concentratedin the areas of experimental nuclear physics, experimental atomic physics,and theoretical nuclear and atomic physics. Operation of the HolifieldHeavy Ion Research Facility as a national user facility continues torepresent the single largest activity within the Division. This yearsaw the completion of the acceleration tube upgrade of the 25-MV tandemelectrostatic accelerator and the achievement of record terminal potentials,operation for an experiment with 25 million volts on terminal, and successfultests with beam at 25.5 MV. The experimental nuclear physics programcontinues to be dominated by research utilizing heavy ions. These activities,while continuing to center largely on the Holifield Facility, have seensignificant growth in the use of facilities that provide intermediateenergies and especially ultrarelativistic beams. The UNISOR program,since its inception, has been intimately associated with the Divisionand, most particularly, with the Holifield Facility. In addition to theHolifield Facility, the Division operates two smaller facilities, theEN Tandem and the ECR Ion Source Facility, as ``User Resources.'' Theefforts in theoretical physics, covering both nuclear and atomic physics,are presented. In addition to research with multicharged heavy ions fromthe ECR source, the effort on atomic physics in support of the controlledfusion program includes a plasma diagnostics development program. Theconcentration of this program on optical and laser technology is markedby the change in designation to the Laser and Electro-Optics Lab. A small,continuing effort in elementary particle physics, carried out in collaborationwith the University of Tennessee, is reported.</TEXT></DOC>
