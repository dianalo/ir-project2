The intervention apparently helped the dollar rise slightly against the yen by late afternoon in New York, but the U.S. currency still fell more than 1% against major European currencies.    It wasn't clear how sizable the reported U.S. intervention was. The Treasury, adhering to its traditional policy of refusing to comment on whether the U.S. intervenes in exchange markets, declined to confirm or deny reports of a U.S. presence in the markets.    The Bank of Japan also was reported to have intervened in an attempt to halt the yen's rise. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York handles intervention for both the U.S. and the Bank of Japan.    The U.S. action reflects increasing concern in Washington that the dollar may be declining too rapidly.    The administration has wanted since mid-1985 to see the dollar fall against the yen and the West German mark. But over the past two weeks, officials have become wary that if the dollar falls too fast and too far, it could crimp the ability of export-dependent economies such as Japan's to grow more rapidly and absorb more imports, as the U.S. wants.    Reports of the joint intervention began circulating after a tumultuous morning in the markets, during which the dollar dropped to as low as 150.35 yen -- below the range of 152 to 162 yen that U.S. and Japanese officials have hinted they believe is appropriate for the dollar's value.    U.S. officials have in the past appeared to indicate that Washington wasn't prepared to intervene to prevent the dollar from falling through the 152-yen barrier.    Meanwhile, finance ministers of the U.S. and its four major economic allies appeared to be moving closer to a decision on whether to schedule an emergency meeting in Paris, possibly as early as the weekend of Feb. 7, to discuss the currency situation and the problem posed by continuing global trade imbalances.    Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, said although the date of a meeting of the so-called Group of Five still hadn't been decided, &quot;it appears that we shouldn't wait too long.&quot;    Analysts speculated that U.S. willingness to hold such a meeting soon, rather than wait for a more customary March or April date, increased in the wake of President Reagan's State of the Union address Wednesday night. The president's speech was poorly received by the currency markets.    Currency traders said the president's inability to put the Iran-Contra scandal behind him heightened anxiety about his ability to exert leadership. The markets also apparently interpreted a restatement this week by the administration of its previous acceptance of a gradual decline in the dollar as evidence that the White House wanted the dollar to decline further.    Monetary officials said a U.S. decision on whether to hold the finance ministers' meeting next week or later would depend partly on U.S. foreign-trade statistics for December. Policy makers are scheduled to receive the data today and the Commerce Department is slated to release them to the public tomorrow.    If the figures show the U.S. trade deficit widened substantially last month, Washington may want to schedule the finance ministers' meeting for the weekend of Feb. 7 in order to head off a possible run on the dollar. If the statistics show improvement, U.S. authorities may try to postpone the session until March.    Attempts to schedule an early conference are meeting resistance from some European governments, which fear that failure to reach a substantive agreement at the session could disappoint market expectations and send the dollar plunging more rapidly.    Washington wants Bonn and Tokyo to spur their economies to help stimulate more buying of imports, while those countries want the U.S. to cut its budget deficit more sharply. All sides agree the U.S., West Germany and Japan are at an impasse and seem unlikely to be able to break it any time soon.    Japan is the major proponent of an early meeting. The country, which hopes the session will help stabilize the dollar's fall against the yen, is expected to cut its discount rate late next week if the session is held.    U.S. officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker has been devoting an increasing proportion of his time to the dollar's decline, and to the growing lack of confidence in the markets about the ability of the U.S. and its economic allies to reduce their trade imbalances.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker also has expressed some apprehension that too steep a decline might prove counterproductive.    U.S. officials took pains yesterday to dispel suggestions that the markets were in turmoil. An administration official, asked about yesterday morning's market flurry, said a spate of statistics show the dollar's gyrations against the West German mark and yen have been comparatively slight.    ---   Yesterday's Market Activity   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.7788 West German marks, down 1.1% from 1.7982 Tuesday. The dollar also fell 1.1% to 1.4928 Swiss francs, from 1.5093. The dollar firmed to 151.39 yen, from 151.18.    At midday in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 152.15 yen, up slightly from yesterday's late New York quote.    Dollar sentiment in the market remains overwhelmingly bearish. Traders are convinced the Reagan administration still wants a lower dollar to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit but isn't saying so to appease its trade partners, who are hurt by the currency's decline.    &quot;There's no valid reason to be buying dollars at this time except to cover short (oversold) positions,&quot; said Charles A. Luma, vice president of foreign-exchange at Industrial Bank of Japan, New York.    Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign-exchange at First National Bank of Chicago, said dealers view the dollar as a &quot;hot potato.&quot; Traders, he said, &quot;just don't want to hold dollars. As soon as they get their hands on dollars, they try to unload them.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $5.20 an ounce to $410.30 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was seven million ounces.    ---   Charles W.
