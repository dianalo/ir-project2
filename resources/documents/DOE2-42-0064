The accuracy ofthe assessments was for each of the observers and for the observers'agreed-upon assessments, determined against findings at laparotomy orautopsy. Overall accuracy, predictive values of a positive and negativetest result, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.71-0.79, 0.80-0.90,0.63-0.72, 0.63-0.77 and 0.77-0.91, respectively. The accuracy was nothigher for the agreed-upon assessment than for each of the observers'assessments. The interobserver variation was calculated as overall agreementbetween pairs of observers, and ranged from 0.85 to 0.94. After adjustmentof overall agreement for chance agreement, kappa values from 0.70 to0.88 were obtained. In the determination of intraobserver variation,overall agreement rates and kappa values ranged from 0.90 to 0.94 and0.84 to 0.88. The scintigraphic diagnosis of hepatic metastases is reliable,but to increase the reliability further it should be examined whetherobserver error reflects error in the primary detection of findings inthe scans or error in the overall interpretation.</TEXT></DOC>
