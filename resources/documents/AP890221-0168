ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North's criminal trial opened Tuesdaywith the prosecutor portraying him as a liar who ``places himselfabove the law'' but with North's lawyer defending him as a patrioticMarine who obeyed unflinchingly the orders of his commander in chief.   North, now retired from the service, listened intently asprosecutor John Keker told the jury the defendant had lied time andagain to his president and to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.   Chief defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan countered that North, aformer top National Security Council aide, worked in a secret worldwhere ``he always acted with the approval of his superiors; he actedalways with the best interests of his country.''   Thus the two sides squared off for the oft-delayed first trial tocome out of the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that may take as much asfive months to complete.   The first testimony comes Wednesday morning when Rep. LeeHamilton, D-Ind., the former chairman of House IntelligenceCommittee, takes the stand.   Keker told the jury Tuesday that North had profited personally byusing traveler's checks furnished by a Contra leader and, on abroader scale, had told lies that amounted to ``a crime that goes tothe soul of our self-government.''   ``You will hear he considers himself a patriotic person, butthere is no higher patriotic purpose than to protect our system ofgovernment,'' Keker said. ``To lie to Congress because you mistrustit then is a crime and not a defense.''   Sullivan did portray North as a patriot, saying he believed inthe Marine motto ``Semper Fidelis'' _ always faithful.   ``He lived with that Marine Corps motto. He was always faithfulto country, to commander in chief, to his family, to those whoselives depended on him,'' said Sullivan.   And yet, said the defense attorney: ``Lt. Col. Oliver North hasin the end been abandoned by his government.''   North's eyes moistened as Sullivan wound up his opening statementalmost in a whisper.   The lawyer said that North was the troubleshooter at the NationalSecurity Council, and if ``a secret mission had to be accomplished,it was `Let Ollie do it.'''   When Congress decided not to support the Nicaraguan freedomfighters in 1984, Sullivan said, ``the president was angry ... andhe vowed he would find a way to support them.''   Reagan ordered National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane ``tokeep them together body and soul and it was then the job of OllieNorth,'' Sullivan said.   He recited a lengthy version of the history of the Iran-Contraaffair to the jury, some of whose members appeared to be noddingoff. Sullivan noted that while the Reagan administration was barredby law from directly helping the Contras, officials solicited fundsfor the cause from other countries.   He quoted Reagan as saying privately at the time, ``If this leaksout, we'll all be hanging by our thumbs outside the White Houseuntil we find out who did it.''   North followed the opening statements of Keker and Sullivan withunflagging interest. He sat upright during the presentations whichtook four hours, sometimes looking toward his wife, Betsy, who wasin the front row of spectators.   The courtroom was filled to its 120-seat capacity, with reporterstaking 60. The public got only 15 and the rest went to assortedlawyers, prosecutors and government security experts. U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell allowed four representatives of intelligenceagencies in court to monitor the large amounts of classifiedinformation expected to be revealed publicly in the trial.   North is charged with 12 criminal counts, nine of them having todo with deceiving Congress and the president. The other threeinvolve charges that he personally profited from the Iran-Contraaffair.   ``The need for secrecy is no excuse for lies,'' Keker said.   At one point, he said, a House committee had met with North inthe White House seeking the truth about the situation.   ``The committee looked Oliver North right in the eye and Northlooked them right in the eye and he lied,'' Keker said.   Keker said North took $4,000 of the $90,000 in traveler's checksthat Contra leader Adolfo Calero gave him to cover expenses.   ``Colonel North used that $4,000 like it was his personalpiggy-bank'' for groceries, tires and to take his family on a trip,Keker told the jury.   Keker called North's fabrications to a presidential inquiry anextraordinary criminal act ``by a man who at some point stopsplaying by the rules and places himself above the law.''   But Sullivan countered that North never broke the law, that ``hefollowed the instructions of the highest-ranking officials of theUnited States of America.''   North was a Marine lieutenant colonel with 20 years service and adistinguished Vietnam War record when he resigned from the serviceafter his indictment last March.   Sullivan, who became known nationally during the 1987congressional hearings on the affair, held up thumb and forefinger aquarter-inch apart and told the jury: ``He never had this muchcriminal intent.''   North testified at the hearings under immunity from prosecutionfor anything he might say. Keker, working for independent counselLawrence E. Walsh, had to develop his evidence for the trial withoutrecourse to the hearing transcript.   Keker told the jury that the Bible says there is a time and placefor everything.   ``When the time came for Oliver North to tell the truth, helied,'' Keker said. ``When the time came to come clean, he shredded,erased and altered. When the time came to let the light shine in, hecovered up.''</TEXT></DOC>
