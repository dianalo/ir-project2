The department, responding to a request from the House GovernmentOperations Committee, said criminal penalties in the 1970Occupational Safety and Health Act do not pre-empt state and localcriminal laws.   ``We see nothing in the (act) or its legislative history whichindicates that Congress intended for the relatively limited criminalpenalities provided by the act to deprive employees of theprotection provided by state criminal laws of generalapplicability,'' the department said.   The opinion, dated last Friday and released Wednesday by theHouse panel's subcommittee on employment and housing, flies in theface of several recent state court rulings throwing out criminalconvictions against employers whose workers were injured throughviolations of federal job safety standards.   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman, said hewelcomed what he called the ``long overdue'' statement dealing withthe issue.   ``I am pleased that Justice agrees with us and squarely rejectsthe position that the federal OSHA law shields employers who showwillful disregard for worker safety from state criminalprosecution,'' Lantos said   In a hearing before the subcommittee last February, prosecutorsfrom several states testified about indictments being dismissed andconvictions overturned because judges had ruled that the OSHA lawpre-empts state prosecution.   Judges in Colorado, New York, Illinois, Texas and Michigan haveruled that federal enforcement of safety standards pre-empts statecriminal prosecutions of employers. However, judges in Wisconsinhave ruled just the opposite.   The issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court eventually,possibly through a case now before the Illinois Supreme Court.   In that case, Cook County prosecutors won indictments on criminalcharges of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and assault againstChicago Magnet Wire Corp. and five of its officials for allegedlyexposing workers to phosgene and other toxic gases.   However, before the case went to trial, the Illinois AppellateCourt dismissed the indictments as being a pre-emption of thefederal OSHA law.</TEXT></DOC>
