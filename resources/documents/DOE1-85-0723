Formulas, readilytranslatable into computer code, are given for such engagement parametersas slant range, closing velocity, and line-of-sight incidence angle interms of satellite and missile position and velocity data. These formulasare the foundation of a model developed at RAND to support study of theBMD capability of various satellite armament concepts.</TEXT></DOC>
