In a Batman comic book hitting newsstands next week, DC Comics Inc. is killing off one of its oldest characters, the younger half of the Dynamic Duo. As the story has it, the Boy Wonder is blown to bits by a bomb planted by Iran's new ambassador to the United Nations, that clown prince of crime, the nefarious Joker.    In the real world, Robin, who was created by artist Bob Kane in 1940, was done in by readers. A 900 phone number set up by DC in September enabled a small group of hard-core fans to vote on whether Robin should live or die. By a narrow margin of 5,343 to 5,271, they voted to have him bite the dust. And DC officials insist that, unlike some seemingly indestructible comic-book villains, he's gone for good.    &quot;The office is in mourning,&quot; says Denny O'Neil, editor of the Batman series. Robin was &quot;a nice counterbalance to the essential grimness of Batman,&quot; he explains. &quot;He kept him from being an emotionless vigilante.&quot;    Bat-fans, however, can breathe a sigh of relief. The Robin dispatched by blood-thirsty readers wasn't Dick Grayson, the youthful ward of millionaire Bruce Wayne who fought by Batman's side in the early days and on the late-1960s TV show. DC officials say Grayson dropped the Robin name and costume in 1984 and adopted a new secret identity as Nightwing. He now heads a superteam in &quot;The New Teen Titans,&quot; one of DC's best-selling series.    But DC, mindful that it still needed a Robin (if only to keep its many &quot;Batman andamp; Robin&quot; merchandising tie-ins alive), had Bruce Wayne adopt a second ward, Gotham City street tough Jason Todd.    The problem, says Mr. O'Neil, was that the new Robin was disliked by comic fans as a usurper of the name. Letters to DC called the character &quot;a vindictive, vengeful little brat&quot; and a &quot;wimp,&quot; and urged DC to &quot;waste him.&quot; In fact, according to Dan Raspler, assistant Batman editor, some delighted readers are now exulting, &quot;We offed the twerp! We offed the twerp!&quot;    Ghoulish fans have one other reason to be happy. The first two issues of the four-issue set &quot;A Death in the Family,&quot; which were on sale this summer for 75 cents, have already skyrocketed in price to $3.50. </TEXT></DOC>
