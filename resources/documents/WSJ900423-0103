The East German government has demanded parity between thetwo currencies because of fears by its citizens that theirpurchasing power will plummet if their country unites withWest Germany and accepts a lower exchange rate. But WestGermans are concerned that the one-to-one rate woulddestabilize their currency and lead to rapid inflation.   More than 202,000 responses were recorded in last week'ssurvey by the television station ZDF, smashing a previousrecord of 86,000. The station warned that the survey was arandom sampling that shouldn't be considered representative.   But a central bank spokesman said that &quot;the fact that sucha huge number of people responded gives the result a morerepresentative quality.&quot;                                                                                                          MEXICAN NEWSPRINT                                                                                                          The Mexican government lifted its control over newsprint,a monopoly often criticized as an obstacle to press freedom.In announcing the move at a gathering of newspaper editorsand publishers, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari saidnewsprint could now be freely imported, though a 15% tariffwould be levied. In past years, there were frequentallegations that the government withheld newsprint suppliesto opposition newspapers and periodicals.                                                                                                          JOBLESS POLES   Unemployment in Poland reached nearly a third of a millionin mid-April, or about 2.4% of the work force, the LaborMinistry said. Many state companies are slashing their laborforces in order to survive as the government cuts subsidiesand attempts to inject competition into the stagnant economy.                                                                                                          FREEZING OUT LITHUANIA                                                                                                          The Soviet Union has asked a Japanese consortium to changeits plans to build a refrigerator compressor plant inLithuania and instead locate it elsewhere in the SovietUnion. The request was reported by Sanyo Electric Co., amember of the consortium, which also includes trading concernNissho Iwai and Toyo Engineering Corp. Moscow is currentlyapplying economic sanctions against Lithuania to force it towithdraw its declaration of independence from the SovietUnion. Officials of the Japanese consortium say they haven'tdecided whether to accept the Soviet request.                                                                                                          SOUTH AFRICAN DIPLOMACY                                                                                                          South Africa opened a permanent mission in Budapest in amove that could herald full diplomatic ties with Hungary. Themission, short of a formal embassy, gives South Africa itsfirst diplomatic foothold in Eastern Europe. Hungary's statenews agency MTI said Budapest would open a similar office inPretoria within a month.                                                                                                          JAPANESE GROWTH                                                                                                          Despite the recent decline in the yen as well as in stockand bond prices, the Japanese economy will expand at a stillrespectable, inflation-adjusted 4.3% pace in the fiscal yearending March 31, 1991, predicts a leading think tank. TheWako Research Institute of Economics said strong personalconsumption and corporate investment in plant and equipmentwill compensate for weaknesses elsewhere in the economy.                                                                                                          BRAZILIAN COUCH BOOM                                                                                                          President Fernando Collor de Mello's drastic economic planhas Brazilian psychiatrists laboring overtime to give solaceto the nation's wealthy.   &quot;I've been working 14 hours a day since the plan wasannounced. The rich feel a mixture of panic, astonishment,anger and depression, and they want to talk about it,&quot; saidFlavio Gikovate, director of the Institute of Psychotherapy.Other psychiatrists in Sao Paulo and Rio, the largest cities,report sharp increases in the number of patients, most ofthem affluent.   Mr. Collor's plan, in effect since March 16, set an18-month freeze on savings accounts of more than $1,200;limited withdrawals from money market funds to $600, or 20%of an account, whichever is greater; and froze about $115billion -- 80% of all bank deposits.   Most of Brazil's poor majority weren't directly hitbecause few had savings. And with inflation drasticallyreduced during the past month, many of the worst-off saytheir salaries buy more.
