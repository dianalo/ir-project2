Vergilio decided the FBI could complete both its regular requestsand the Census checks if the regular requests were delayed.andM;&quot;Criminals should not be entering homes in the guise of Census officials,&quot;Vergilio wrote.andP;  &quot;However, the record fails to establish that the interestcannot be accommodated pending a decision of the board.&quot;andM;Vergilio admitted the FBI system suffered from inadequacies, but said the FBIhad failed to demonstrate an overriding need to continue with the Vion award.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
