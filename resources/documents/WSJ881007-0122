A legal opinion by the agency, which establishes the government's interpretation of laws protecting the handicapped, significantly broadens the protection for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. &quot;There will often be little, if any, justification for treating infected individuals differently from others,&quot; the department concluded.    The move is an about-face for the Justice Department, which two years ago determined that laws protecting the handicapped didn't guard victims of AIDS and other contagious diseases from discrimination prompted primarily by fears of spreading the disease.    The opinion is binding on federal agencies, government contractors, school boards, managers of federally subsidized housing projects and other organizations receiving federal contracts or financial assistance. But it also is likely to be incorporated in arguments by employees alleging discrimination by private companies, and could affect how some judges view the overall AIDS issue.    Asserting that even &quot;unreasonable&quot; fears of contamination wouldn't trigger anti-discrimination penalties, the 1986 opinion prompted sharp criticism from many public-health officials, lawmakers, civil rights activists and gay groups.    Department officials said the latest opinion reflects recent medical developments, a 1987 Supreme Court decision and congressional action clarifying the scope of certain anti-discrimination statutes.    The opinion emphasizes that during the early stages of the disease, before the onset of obvious symptoms, there generally isn't any legal or medical justification to discriminate in any way against such individuals. As more-serious symptoms appear, employers and others must determine on a case-by-case basis whether infected individuals pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, according to the agency.    The opinion, written by Douglas Kmiec, acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel, and reviewed by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, was praised by agency critics.    Christine Gebbie, a member of the now-defunct presidential AIDS commission and administrator of the Oregon health division, described the ruling as more than a symbolic victory. &quot;I know people were fired because of a fear of AIDS,&quot; she said. &quot;That {earlier} interpretation inhibited&quot; those individuals &quot;from taking legal action to protect themselves.&quot;    Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said he was &quot;pleased the Justice Department has finally caught up with the Supreme Court.&quot;    The 29-page opinion says that in most situations &quot;the probability that the AIDS virus will be transmitted is slight,&quot; and that generally neither health nor worker-performance considerations &quot;will provide a justification for excluding&quot; infected individuals from employment or other benefits.    However, the opinion indicates that the impact of the AIDS virus on the central nervous system and the &quot;uncertain state&quot; of medical knowledge about the disease probably requires that some infected employees in sensitive jobs stop working altogether.    According to the document, it may be impossible to make &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; for positions such as &quot;bus driver, airline pilot or air traffic controller,&quot; where &quot;the risk of injury is great&quot; if the infected worker isn't able &quot;to perform the duties of the job.&quot;    In announcing the new position, Mr. Thornburgh said legislation may be necessary to &quot;adequately and appropriately&quot; protect the rights of AIDS victims. </TEXT></DOC>
