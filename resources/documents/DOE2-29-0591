The data gathered provided a detailed list of thehospital primary diagnoses found on the 1766 charts within the 1158 medicalrecords studied. Based upon statistical analyses coal miners were over-representedin hospital primary diagnoses (diseases and injuries) by categories andby types. There was also a meaningful relationship between frequenciesof hospital primary diagnoses (diseases and injuries) by categories,and specified contractual employer (for the miner) and month of the yearadmitted to the hospital (for both groups). Neither age (for each group)nor the contractual mining strikes (for miners only), and frequenciesof hospital primary diagnoses (diseases and injuries) by categories wererelated. 8 refs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
