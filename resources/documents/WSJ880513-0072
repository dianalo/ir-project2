It was tested for 1 1/2 hours through a 55/64-inch choke and showed minimal pressure drawdown.    The well is about 250 yards from another well drilled in November, which flowed at 3,700 barrels of oil and 2.9 million cubic feet of gas a day. Consolidated, Pittsburgh, said it holds 100% interest in the two wells, as well as most of the interest in the surrounding acreage. The gas and oil concern is drilling three more wells in the area.    Consolidated said the Cottonwood Creek field is its largest oil discovery ever and could &quot;be the largest single discovery in Oklahoma in the last 10 years.&quot;    The company has added about four million barrels of oil to its total reserves, as a result of the first well. </TEXT></DOC>
