L. 100-440 to the Treasurerof the United States, who is authorized to redelegate operational responsibilityfor sales. Prior to authorizing each sale, the Treasurer will consult witha Silver Sales Review Group comprised of the Assistant Secretaries forEconomic Policy, Domestic Finance, International Affairs, Legislative Affairs,and Management, or their respective designee. Sales will proceed as scheduledat the direction of the Treasurer unless the Review Group advises the Treasurerin writing that a sale should not proceed.Two sales of 1,250,000 fine troy ounces each are planned for fiscal year1989. Sales are expected in May and August, 1989. Four quarterly salesof 625,000 fine troy ounces each are expected in October, January, April,and July of fiscal years 1990 and 1991. It is anticipated that the U.S.Mint will conduct the sales using the Defense Logistics Agency as an agent.The Department has developed the following market-based criterion to define``severe market disruption'':<ITAG tagnum="21">A proposed sale should be allowed to go forward unless there havebeen at least 15 spot market declines in the price of silver in the previous20 business days, and the price of silver has fallen by five percent ormore during those 20 days. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule will be applied on the day before the sale is announced,making use of that day's price and the prices for the previous 20 tradingdays, to determine whether the annoucement should take place. Then, ifthe rule permits the announcement to be done, the rule will be appliedagain using the price figure six days prior to the date of sale and thefigures from the previous 20 days. If this second application of the ruleindicates that the sale should be cancelled, there will be five days leftto announce the cancellation.</ITAG>Using that criterion, the Department expects to hold its first sale inearly May. <ITAG tagnum="6">David M.
