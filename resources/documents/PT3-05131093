Said      arrangement 5 involves the provision on the underside 6 of the visor of      attachment devices 7 of an appropriate kind which permit the detachable      connection of a pair of binoculars 8 to said headgear 1. The attachment      device 7 in question is so arranged as to interact with a complementary      attachment element 9, which is capable of application to a pair of      binoculars 8 of said kind intended to be capable of connection as required      to the headgear 1 for the purpose of permitting the detachable support of      the binoculars 8 on the underside 6 of the visor in an area 10 in front of      the wearer's eyes 11. </PAR><PAR>  Said attachment device and attachment element appropriately consist of a      so-called `Velcro` fastener 7 and 9, preferably in the form of `Velcro`      strip or similar. Said strips, etc., 7, 9, are attached in such a way to      the visor 4 and the binoculars 8 as to extend across same. </PAR><PAR>  An appropriate pair of binoculars 8 to be supported by a visor 4 without      the visor 4 being caused to bend downwards excessively, or without the cap      1 falling from the person, is a pair of binoculars 8 of a kind which is      made of cardboard for some other sheet material with appropriately      attached lenses, etc., 12, 13, and which is capable of being folded from      an unfolded binocular position I, for example as shown in FIG. 4, and a      collapsed storage position II, for example as shown in FIG. 5. A `Velcro`      strip 9 can thus be attached to upper surface 14 of the binoculars 8 in      such a way that is also covers at least a part of a scored line 15 which      extends across the binoculars 8 and their direction of vision 16. </PAR><PAR>  Said `Velcro` strips 7, 9 are preferably capable of being applied to the      intended attachment surface 6A, 14A by heating and/or pressing against the      intended attachment point, in so doing activating an attachment agent,      such as adhesive or glue, etc., which has been applied to the rear surface      of said `Velcro` strip. </PAR><PAR>  A further effect is achieved thanks to the invention through the      arrangement of the binoculars 8 in such a way as to be capable of      attachment to the visor 4 at a selected distance X from the eyes 11 of the      wearer such that unobstructed forward vision can be achieved through      rearward inclination of the wearer's head 3, so that the visor 4 and thus      also the binoculars 8 are raised together into a position in which they      face forwards and upwards at an angle and permit an unobstructed view      beneath the binoculars 8, which can be advantageous if it is wished to      look at close objects without the help of the binoculars. </PAR><PAR>  A further effect which can be achieved is to cause the extension of the      effective length L of the visor in front of the wearer by arranging the      binoculars 8 in such a way as to be capable of attachment so that they      represent an extension of the visor 4. </PAR><PAR>  When it is wished to use the binoculars 8, the binoculars are taken out,      and the collapsible binoculars 8 are raised from their folded position II      into the effective binocular position I and are attached to the visor 4 of      an intended item of headgear by means of an attachment device 7 or an      attachment element 9 which have already been attached. </PAR><PAR>  The possibility is also afforded for the attachment of the attachment      device 7 and the attachment element 9 by some other appropriate means to      suitable patterns, for example a number of attachment devices running in      the longitudinal sense of the visor and situated at a certain distance      from one another. </PAR><PAR>  A further illustrative embodiment of the invention is shown in FIGS. 6-8 in      the drawings, and an item of headgear 101 utilized in this case is of the      kind which is made from sheet material and is capable of being folded to      produce a cap, which is retained in the intended size position to which it      has been adjusted by means of a locking tongue 151 capable of being      accommodated in an appropriate slot 150, so as to form a bowl-shaped upper      part 102, which covers the head 103 of a wearer of the cap, etc., as well      as a sun visor 104 projecting forwards at an angle from the upper part 102      on the front 101A of the cap. </PAR><PAR>  An arrangement 105 for the detachable connection of a pair of binoculars      108 to the cap 101 comprises attachment means 152, 153 of an appropriate      kind. Said attachment means preferably consist of attachment devices 152      which extend between the binoculars 108 and the visor 104, which are      preferably lockable in an intended attachment position C, so that the      binoculars 108 can be securely supported on the under side 106 of the      visor in the area in front of the wearer's eyes. </PAR><PAR>  The binoculars 108 in said case are appropriately also in the form of a      pair of binoculars which are made from cardboard or some other suitable      sheet material with suitably attached lenses, etc., 112, 113, and which      are capable of being folded between the unfolded binocular position CI and      a collapsed storage position (not shown). </PAR><PAR>  These binoculars 108 are preferably also so arranged as to be capable of      attachment to a visor 104 at a selected distance in front of the wearer's      eyes, such that an unobstructed view forwards can be achieved simply by      the rearward inclination of the wearer's head 103 in a similar fashion to      that in the first example. </PAR><PAR>  Said attachment device consists of uprights 152 which project outwards in a      downward direction from the visor 104. Said upright 152 is capable of      being accommodated in matching slots 153 situated on the respective sides      154, 155 of the binoculars in order to permit the detachable attachment      with ends components 156 of the binoculars 108. </PAR><PAR>  The attachment upright 152 is preferably formed from lateral end walls      situated to either side of the headgear 101 which extend downwards from      the respective side edges 157, 158 of the visor. Each of said attachment      uprights 152 is capable of being accommodated in a matching opening 159      formed in the binoculars 108, which opening is bounded laterally by edges      160, 161 in the upper and lower wall 162, 163 of the binoculars, which      walls can be divided via a scored line 164, 165, and by each end wall 156      of the binoculars 108. </PAR><PAR>  Said attachment uprights 152 are so arranged by means of suitable devices      as to be capable of interacting with the binoculars for the purpose of      locking the binoculars securely in the intended attachment position C,      preferably in the form of a number of locking tongues 166, 167 cut from      the upright 152 and situated at different levels. The arranged locking      tongues 166, 167, etc., are so arranged as to act in an upward direction      168, for example by having their bases 166A, 167 A connected to      corresponding attachment uprights 152 at the bottom. </PAR><PAR>  The assembly of a cap 101 and binoculars 108 of this kind is simple, and      can be clearly appreciated from FIGS. 7 and 8, and the binoculars 108 can      be locked, thanks to the presence of the locking tongues 166, 167, etc.,      in different positions which are more or less extended in the longitudinal      sense viewed between said lenses 112, 113, for the purpose of permitting      the intended adjustable position between the lenses 112, 113 to be changed      so that a sharp image can be obtained from the binoculars 108. </PAR><PAR>  The reliable, simple and effective support of a pair of binoculars is thus      achievable with said further illustrative embodiment, in conjunction with      which lateral protection against disturbing light and reflexes can be      achieved thanks to said lateral end walls 156, which can continue between      the binoculars 108 an the rear part 101B of the cap. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, an example of the application of the invention shown in FIG. 9      comprises a visor cap 201 of a kind similar to the embodiment shown in      FIGS. 6-8, made from flexible sheet material exhibiting a number of      transcurrent slits, from which sheet material the cap can be formed easily      to fit the desired size of head, and an arrangement 205 for the detachable      connection of a pair of binoculars 208 to the cap 201. </PAR><PAR>  The binoculars 208 are similarly appropriately of the kind referred to in      accordance with any of the examples given previously, in conjunction with      which the connection arrangement 205 comprises a number of uprights 275      which are detachably attachable to the visor 204 of the cap, which      uprights are so arranged as to be capable of connection to a pair of      binoculars 208 of the kind in question, should the need arise. </PAR><PAR>  The two uprights 275 can be held together by means of a bridging element      276 capable of being applied above the visor 204, which bridging element,      together with the uprights 275, is in the form of an arch-shaped yoke or      similar. The two attachment uprights 275, which are formed by separate      parts connected to the headgear 201 and passing downwards 277 through      matching, preferably slot-shaped holes 278 in the headgear 201, are      capable of being accommodated in matching openings 259 in the binoculars      208 and of being locked in a similar fashion to that used in the      binoculars 108 in accordance with FIGS. 6-8. </PAR><PAR>  Locking tongues 266, 267, 268 can also be present on the inside of said two      uprights 275, on the one hand for the purpose, as described above in      accordance with the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6-8, of retaining the      binoculars 208 in the desired attached position and, in a similar fashion,      also to permit the secure locking of the uprights 275 to the cap visor 204      through said upper locking tongues 268 interacting with the underside of      the visor and preventing the uprights 275 from being withdrawn in an      upward direction 279. </PAR><PAR>  Said third illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 9 permits the invention to      be applied to headgear without the headgear requiring to be modified to      any great extent beforehand, as it is sufficient in this case to have two      incisions 278 which pass through the visor 204 of the cap 201 in order for      the invention to function. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is not restricted to the illustrative example described above      and shown in the drawings, but may be modified within the scope of the      patent claims without departing from the idea of invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
