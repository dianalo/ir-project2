Swarts, AFLC's deputychief of staff for contracting and manufacturing.andM;Swarts said the new position &quot;provides a means for increased support of boththe systems program manager and item manager.andP;  We recognize that problemssomethimes arise because an individual may not know the acquisition processwell enough to be heard.&quot;andM;The AFLC spent $3 billion on information equipment last year.andP;  The commandoperates 60 mainframes, 237 minicomputers and super-minicomputers and 28,500PCs and terminals.andP;  AFLC is reducing 135 different information systems to 13,mainly by integration.andM;Craig Hull, the ombudsman at the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill air ForceBase, Utah, said he expects to hear mostly from contractors &quot;who cannot getissues resolved through normal contracting channels.&quot;andP;  Mainly, Hull said, hewould be involved in issues during the pre-award phases of a buy.andM;&quot;I can look into it independenty and make a decision about what ought to bedone.andP;  That can range up to the authority to cancel a solicitation,&quot; Hullsaid.andM;An ombudsman rarely would cancel a solicitation, he said.andP;  Swarts and otherofficials at AFLC headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,would have to approve the move first, he added.andP;  An ombudsman cannot act on aparticular solicitation or contracting issue unless a bidder or governmentcontracting officicial asks for his help, Hull said.andM;&quot;Anyone involved in an AFLC contract&quot; can make a complaint, he said.andP;  Hullalso serves as contracts committee chairman at Hill Air Force Base.andP;  All theombudsmen were members of their base committees before they were chosen, hesaid.andM;Hull said his job is to solve problems before they reach formal protests.andO;&quot;Our intention is not in any way to deny anyone the full range of actionsthey can take in order to get an issue resolved,&quot; he said.andM;Swarts said the ombudsman post was created in part &quot;to help reduce the numberof complaints and formal protests we receive from contractos.&quot;andM;Ken Perrotte, an AFLC spokesman, said the command initiated 273,600 contractslast year and 316 were protested.andM;He said the post is a byproduct of the Air Force's new total qualitymanagement policy, which emphasizes better lines of communication between allthe participants in the contracting process.andM;Perrotte said the contracting officer will remain the focal point of AFLCprocurements.andP;  &quot;One of the first question the ombudsman will ask contractorsis, 'Have you talked to the contracting officer yet?'&quot; he said.andM;Swarts said AFLC also is seeking feedback from industry.andP;  &quot;Futuresolicitations will contain a provision asking bidders to tell us where wehave unnecessary or burdensome requirements or improper elements in oursolicitations,&quot; he said.andP;  AFLC also will ask contractors to &quot;give ussuggestions for streamlining the acquisition,&quot; Swarts said.andM;In addition, to Ogden, acquisition ombudsmen are stationed at Tinker AirForce Base, Okla.; Kelly Air Force Base, Texas; McClellan Air Force Base,Calif.; and Robins Air Force Base, Ga.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
