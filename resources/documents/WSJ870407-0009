Bond traders agree that the market is being driven primarily by the dollar, and that until the conclusion of a meeting between the U.S. and its leading trading partners scheduled to be held in Washington tomorrow, the market probably won't make any major moves. But, said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., &quot;if nothing definite comes out of those meetings regarding the dollar, the bond market could be poised for another sell-off.&quot;    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds gained slightly yesterday. Some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds inched up by about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bond prices generally inched higher, as did municipal bond prices.    Some bond prices had rallied early in the day, partly because of growing confidence in the stability of the dollar and partly in response to a report issued Friday by the Labor Department showing an unexpectedly small increase in the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls in March. Some economists said the report was more evidence of a sluggish economy in need of stimulation.    But the gains were damped by a report that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, told a meeting of the Iowa Bankers Association that the U.S. has &quot;no objective&quot; for the dollar's rate on foreign exchange markets.    Many analysts said that the volatility seen in the bond market last week would probably not recur this week. &quot;Spurts in volatility are short-lived,&quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;Those periods of a flat, narrow trading range last longer. Over the next few weeks, there should be very little volatility.&quot;    Charles F. Wills, director of fixed income for Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, concurred. &quot;We're going to go through a mini-consolidation,&quot; he said. &quot;We could end up in a tight trading range pivoting around 7.8%&quot;    Last week's slumping market took its toll on the resultsof the taxable bond market for the month of March. Accordingto Salomon Brothers Inc.'s broad investment-grade bond index,for the first time in almost a year, total returns in allmajor sectors of the U.S. taxable bond market were negative.The index includes U.S. Treasury issues, corporate bonds,mortgage securities and agency issues. Total return measuresbonds' price changes against their income stream.   The total rate of return on the broad index was -0.76% last month, according to Richard Johannesen, a vice president in Salomon's bond market research department. Mr Johannesen said much of the setback in the index came last week, when the falling dollar and a rising prime rate pummeled the government bond market. U.S. Treasurys gave the poorest performance among the taxable bond market, finishing the month at -1.29%, he said.    Yesterday, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds gained 4.68 points to close at 1387.42. The high level for the day was 1391.19; the low was 1385.61.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 edged ahead to 96 4/32 from 95 27/32 Friday, while the yield fell to 7.84% from 7.86%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 inched up to 98 4/32 from 98, as the yield dipped to 7.53% from 7.54%.    Short-term rates were mixed. The average rate on new 13-week Treasury bills at yesterday's regular weekly auction fell to 5.53% from 5.72% last week. The average rate on new 26-week bills dropped to 5.63% from 5.8% the previous week. Meanwhile, the rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend one another overnight, rose to about 6.19% yesterday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The rate averaged 5.99% Friday.    In the corporate sector, a $300 million issue of Ford Motor Credit Co. notes due in five years was priced for offering. The 7 1/2% notes were priced at 99.55 to yield 7.61%, according to Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., the sole underwriter. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, Exxon Capital Ventures Inc., a subsidiary of Exxon Corp. said it issued zero-coupon notes with an aggregate face value of $432.2 million. The notes were priced from 81.727 for those maturing Feb. 15, 1990, to 31.406 for those maturing Feb. 15, 2001, according to Salomon Brothers, the sole underwriter. The notes are rated triple-A by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal arena, a $150 million issue of Montana Department of Highways revenue bonds was offered to investors. Underwriters led by First Boston Corp. priced the issue to yield from 5.5% in 1993 to 7.125% in 2005. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, prices of Texaco Inc. bonds fell sharply and Pennzoil issues rose after the Supreme Court's 9-0 ruling against Texaco. But dealers said trading volume was extremely light because of widespread confusion about Texaco's future.    &quot;The fortunes of Texaco from here on out are very complicated,&quot; said Andrew R. Morse, a senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;It's a very tough call.&quot;    Here are details of yesterday's auction of short-term Treasury bills:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                   13-Week            26-Week Applications ........... $32,999,325,000    $28,933,370,000 Accepted bids ........... $6,603,865,000     $6,617,695,000 Accepted at low price .............. 54%                78% Accepted noncompet'ly ... $1,241,675,000       $823,620,000 Average price (Rate) .... 98.602 (5.53%)     97.154 (5.63%) High price (Rate) ....... 98.605 (5.52%)     97.164 (5.61%) Low price (Rate) ........ 98.602 (5.53%)     97.154 (5.63%) Coupon equivalent ................ 5.70%              5.89%   Both issues are dated April 9.
