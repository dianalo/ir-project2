Selling by Bear Stearns directors, officers and majorshareholders is running at higher levels this year than anyyear since Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that tracksSecurities and Exchange Commission &quot;insider&quot; filings, begankeeping records in 1983.</LP><TEXT>   Eleven insiders at Bear Stearns have sold a total of morethan 2.8 million shares so far this year, at $10.13 to $16.13a share. In addition, insiders at the New York firm havefiled forms with the SEC announcing their &quot;intentions tosell&quot; an additional 195,000 shares. Last year, insiderselling at the firm totaled 444,220 shares.   The biggest seller at the New York brokerage firm was BearStearns Chairman Alan &quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg, who has trimmed hisholdings by selling shares worth $9.2 million since Aug. 5.Mr. Greenberg sold 640,415 shares, roughly 18% of hisholdings, according to SEC filings, and retains slightly morethan three million shares.   The sales come after the run-up sparked by a major reboundin securities industry profits. Last November, Bear Stearnsstock was trading at about $7.50 a share, roughly half of itscurrent level. In late New York Stock Exchange tradingyesterday, Bear Stearns shares fell 50 cents to $15.50.   In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he sold &quot;some for myfoundation, some for a trust and sold some for myself.&quot; Mr.Greenberg added that 25% of his income goes to purchasingBear Stearns &quot;units.&quot; The units are convertible to stock andcan be sold after five years, but these purchases don't showup in insider filings because they are internal corporatetransactions, the firm said.   The stock sales by Mr. Greenberg and others follow somehefty pay increases for some of the brokerage firm's topexecutives. Thirteen Bear Stearns officials received payincreases averaging 25% in the fiscal year ended in June, foran average paycheck of $2.8 million apiece. Mr. Greenberg hadcash compensation of $5.3 million, up from $4.2 million ayear earlier, according to the firm's proxy statement. Thosefigures don't include any Bear Stearns stock.   James Cayne, Bear Stearns president, said, &quot;The people whosold still have an awful lot of stock, and all they're doingis diversifying.&quot; He added that he did not sell any stockhimself because &quot;the stock, at roughly 1 1/2 times bookvalue, is very cheap, and I think it's going to go higher.&quot;   The insider sales were offset, according to Mr. Cayne, bypurchases of 3.3 million shares by the firm's capitalaccumulation plan on behalf of management.   Bear Stearns reported recently that net income for thefiscal first quarter ended Sept. 27 surged to $47.1 million,or 46 cents a share, from $18 million, or 16 cents a share, ayear earlier. However, the year-earlier quarter was one ofthe company's weakest since the investment-banking firm wentpublic in 1985.   Meanwhile, there has also been record insider selling atthe St. Petersberg, Fla., brokerage firm Raymond JamesFinancial Inc. So far this year, eight insiders have sold385,665 shares at an average price of $23.22 each, SECfilings show. Insider selling is rare at the company; theinsiders' 1991 sales are greater than their combined salesfrom 1988 through 1990, even when accounting for the firm's3-for-2 stock split last April.   The largest seller at Raymond James Financial was HerbertEhlers, the president of its Eagle Asset Managementsubsidiary, who sold 178,950 shares in 21 separate sales fromApril 29 through September, according to SEC filings. Hecouldn't be reached for comment. The shares represented 36%of his holdings, according to SEC filings.   &quot;The three-for-two stock split made some salesadvantageous,&quot; said a Raymond James spokesman. The insiderssold shares &quot;for diversification and liquidation for personalreasons,&quot; he added.   In Big Board trading yesterday, Raymond James shares fell87.5 cents to $27.125.</TEXT></DOC>
