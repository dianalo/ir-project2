Roskam, was quoted as tellinga Dutch newspaper. The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it didn'tyet know the total cost of the hostages' involuntary stay inBaghdad but had already been billed for about $47,000 byhotels.   &quot;The hostages were offered accommodation in DutchEmbassy-owned buildings, which would have been free, but mostdid not take up the offer, so we will pass on to them thecost of their hotel bills,&quot; a ministry spokeswoman said.   About 160 Dutch hostages were held in Iraq, but 105 ofthem were sailors who lived aboard dredgers under contract todeepen the navigation channel to the southern Iraqi port ofUmm Qasr.                                                                                                          IN FRANCE, A HOLIDAY WARNING                                                                                                          A French radio station warned New Year revelers to bewareof flying champagne corks. &quot;Eye trauma by champagne cork isthe main cause of eyes lost in this country,&quot; radioFrance-Infos told listeners in a list of holiday safety tips.&quot;You aim the bottle in jest at someone near you when openingit and -- pop -- off it goes into their eye or into yours.&quot;                                                                                                          HONG KONG TOURISM IMPROVES                                                                                                          Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong totaled 5.4 million in theyear's first 11 months, the Hong Kong Tourist Associationsaid. That figure was up 10% from the same period in 1989,when tourism to the region fell sharply following thesuppression of China's democracy movement. Despite the markedgrowth in tourism so far this year, visits by NorthAmericans, considered to be among the biggest spenders, wereoff 2%. The numbers of tourists from Japan and Taiwan, whotogether account for more than two-fifths of all visitors,were up 13% and 18%, respectively.                                                                                                          ILLEGAL SOVIET PAYMENTS                                                                                                          The Soviet State Bank warned foreign banks and financialinstitutions not to accept illegal payments in rubles fromSoviet banks and businesses. The bank said Soviet enterpriseshave recently tried to make tens of billions of rubles ofpayments to foreign companies, claiming they have thegovernment's backing. Soviet law forbids anyone, be it anindividual or a business, from exporting more than 30 rubleswithout special permission. The Soviet Union is concernedabout an accumulation of rubles abroad, which could be dumpedback into the economy without notice.                                                                                                          `COME TO ISRAEL'                                                                                                          Israel's ambassador to Bonn, Benjamin Navon, said Israelwas troubled that Soviet Jews fleeing anti-Semitism anddismal living conditions were streaming to newly unitedGermany. In an interview with the Berlin daily Neue Zeit, Mr.Navon said the Soviet Jews' fleeing to Germany &quot;is contraryto the Zionist position that since the state of Israel hasexisted, there can be no more Jewish refugees in the world.&quot;He added: &quot;The issue of refugees is totally unacceptable forus. If they leave the Soviet Union, they should come to theirold and new homeland Israel, where they are wanted andloved.&quot;                                                                                                          FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN INDONESIA                                                                                                          Indonesia has approved $8.7 billion of foreign investmentsin 1990, a jump of 84% over the 1989 figure, the chairman ofthe nation's Coordinating Investment Board said.
