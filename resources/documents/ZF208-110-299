Rooker, an IBM vice president, said the Navy saved the governmentmoney by buying the IBM equipment.andP;  He said he did not see why the governmentmust wait up to a year for the plug-compatible industry to develop a productthat IBM could provide immediately.andM;Derek Vander Schaaf, deputy DOD inspector general, said that in a procurementinvolving the Naval Military Personnel Command, an IG investigation foundthat IBM officials, at the Navy's request, briefed command officers onpreparing specifications for an upcoming mainframe buy.andP;  No other vendorswere asked for advice.andM;This was not illegal, Vander Schaaf said, because IBM did not write thespedifications.andP;  But it appears unethical and such practices should not beallowed, he said.andM;&quot;It smacks of being illegal for a person outside the government to come inand influence how the specifications are written,&quot; said Rep.andP;  Frank Horton(R-N.!.).andP;  &quot;If it isn't illegal, I think we ought to make it illegal.&quot;andM;In a report released as the hearings opened, the General Accounting Officesaid that during the last 3-1/2 years, the Navy obligated more dollars to IBMthan to any other vendor.andM;In at least one major procurement, for the Naval Standard Civilian PayrollSystem, &quot;the results of our review are especially disturbing because it showsnot mismanagement but a lack of concern for full and open competition,&quot; saidRalph Carlone, assistant comptroller general in charge of the InformationManagement and Technology Division.andM;However, Carlone would not say that GAO had found systematic pro-IBM bias orillegal activities in the Navy.andM;In testimony before the subcommittee, the six vendors complained they havenot been given the same access to Navy officials as has IBM.andP;  Further, theysaid, this restricted access has shut them out of a chance to compete openlyfor any share of Navy ADP contracts.andM;&quot;The Navy is rife with all-Blue shops,&quot; said Sidney M. Wilson, vice presidentof PacifiCorp Capital Inc., McLean, Va.andP;  Some Navy managers repeatedlyviolated regulations in buying from the company, he said.andM;Rep.andP;  Gerald D. Kleczka (D-Wis.) pushed the vendors to be specific.andP;  &quot;We areall skimming over the surface at this hearing,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Don't just allegethat there has been this interaction going on.andP;  Give us a concrete example.&quot;andM;None of the vendors told Kleczka what, other than greater access by IBM, ledNavy procurement officers allegedly to break reglations and favor thecompany.andM;Conyers, who is chairman of both the subcommittee and Government Operations,has said he would propose revamping the Brooks Act if the results of hearingsand investigations warrant it.andM;He also has said he believes the 24-year-old act, the main law governingfederal acquisition of ADP equipment, is not rigorous enough to guideagencies in big system acquisitions.andP;  Conyers also said he might refer someevidence to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigations.andM;&quot;The Department of Navy may have wasted literally hundreds of millions ofdollars of taxpayers' money through abuse and mismanagement,&quot; Conyers saidbefore the hearings began.andP;  &quot;We have reason to believe that these conditionsmay exist to some extent throughout the government's procurement system forADP equipment.&quot;andM;Conyers said the hearings would turn up instances of fraud, illegalgratuities, illegal release of proprietary information and &quot;wiredspecifications&quot; in Navy ADP buys.andP;  The vendors -- Amdahl Corp., NCR Comten,Storage Technology Corp., Memorex Telex Corp., PacifiCorp and Vion Corp. --andO;have said Navy officials engaged in these types of actions in an effort toensure purchase of IBM equipment.andM;IBM officials, in previous statements, have denied any wrongdoing in theprocurements.andP;  Mark Holcomb, an IBM spokesman, has said the investigationswill show the federal procurement process works.andM;Although Conyers has asked the GAO to review several other agencies' buyinghabits, the hearings this month will focus only on Navy procurementpractices, committee staff members said.andP;  Hearings on the other agencies --NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the Treasury Department --probably will be held next year.andM;Conyers also asked GAO to conduct a general survey of government ADPprocurement practices.andP;  GAO officials said the survey i nearly complete.andM;The hearings continue this week with an intensive review of the third phaseof the Navy's Data Processing Installations Equipment Transition (DPI-ET).andO;That procurement has been on hold since being challenged on grounds ofimproper bias.andM;Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett and GSA administrator Richard Austin arescheduled to testify next week.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
