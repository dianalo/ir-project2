The share-denominated version of the offer is essentially the same as that in the #237 million agreed-upon bid made by British Airways in July. Though British Caledonian holders accepting the share offer would receive about the same number of British Airways shares as before, the offer's value has fallen 35% because of the plunge in British Airways' stock price.    But British Airways' alternative cash offer totals #119 million, sharply below the #220 million Britain's biggest airline originally offered. Analysts said British Airways may need to increase this offer to win the support of British Caledonian holders who prefer cash to shares.    Attempts to derail British Airways' revised bid, which was made Friday, will come primarily from rivals concerned about the market power of the merged carrier. Air Europe, a unit of International Leisure Group PLC, said yesterday that this week it will seek a court injunction to block the proposed acquisition. The small but fast-growing British airline said it will challenge the British government's recent finding that a merger wouldn't be anticompetitive. British Airways, in turn, threatened to sue Air Europe for any losses resulting from a delay caused by the legal challenge.    British Airways' original offer was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for antitrust review. The commission approved a revised offer with limited restrictions.    The conditions imposed on British Airways won't &quot;produce an environment that guarantees competition will flourish,&quot; said Peter Smart, an International Leisure director. &quot;The government just passed the buck,&quot; leaving the aviation authority to ensure competition, he said.    But Air Europe's legal challenge, along with similar complaints that it and other independent U.K. airlines plan to file with the European Commission, aren't likely to succeed, analysts said. Lawsuits against Monopolies and Mergers Commissions decisions usually have failed. And Air Europe probably wouldn't receive crucial support from British Caledonian.    Another potential pitfall for British Airways would be a competing bid for all or part of British Caledonian. Air Europe said it is considering a full bid after receiving financial information from British Caledonian Friday.    A more serious possibility is a partial bid for British Caledonian by Scandinavian Airlines System, or SAS. An SAS spokesman said yesterday the company still is considering offering to buy a minority stake in British Caledonian if the proposed merger with British Airways founders. Such a move would proably involve a cash injection in return for a 30% to 40% stake in British Caledonian, analysts said. A full offer isn't likely because British Caledonian, if it was acquired by SAS, would probably lose its designation as a U.K. carrier -- and the right to fly certain routes.    British Airways already has had months to lay the governmental groundwork for its bid. British Caledonian, with routes that complement British Airways', also is probably worth more to the big British carrier than SAS. British Airways said it would cut 2,000 British Caledonian jobs if the acquisition is successful.    Still, SAS's interest may force British Airways to raise slightly its cash offer, which is particularly important to closely held Britiah Caledonian's largest shareholder, Investors in Industry. The large investment institution is 85% owned by British clearing banks and 15% by the Bank of England. </TEXT></DOC>
