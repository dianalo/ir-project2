To improve and optimize the design method for the backfillingmaterial, regarding both amount and size of the individual stones, experimentaltests have been performed. To ensure a satisfactory overall protectivestructure, filter criteria acceptance has been integrated in the newproposed design method. 8 refs., 46 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
