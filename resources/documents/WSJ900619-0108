Others fear that itwill.   The U.S., in negotiations slated to end by early nextmonth, is pushing Japan to better arm its relatively weaktrustbusters, hoping to smash collusive practices thatallegedly block newcomers from the Japanese market. The goodnews is that Japan's Fair Trade Commission is cracking moreheads. The bad news is that foreign firms are prime targets.</LP><TEXT>   On June 11, the trade commission issued a report on somelarge gaps in prices among Tokyo, New York, London, Paris andFrankfurt that concluded that U.S. and European importers andtheir agents are keeping prices up and forcing their Japaneseretailers to do the same. The commission said it will use thereport to issue new guidelines and will &quot;deal strictly&quot; withabuses discovered.   This month, the commission raided 14 Japanese offices ofMaster Foods K.K., a subsidiary of Mars Inc., McLean, Va. TheJapanese government is investigating charges that the U.S.firm threatened to cut off supplies of pet food to retailersand wholesalers offering discounts. Master Foods, in a letterto its distributors, denied the charges.   Last October, the trade commission searched the files ofApple Computer Co. and its Japanese distributor, Canon SalesCo., amid allegations there had been pressure put on fourcomputer magazines to suspend ads from independent importersselling PCs at a discount. The case is still underinvestigation, and Apple has denied the charges.   Some Americans think the moves are intentional. &quot;There'svery definitely a tribal mentality,&quot; says William Best,director of the Tokyo office of A.T. Kearney InternationalInc., a U.S. consulting company. &quot;There's still very much aninterest in trying to place the blame on the outsider.&quot;   &quot;There's nothing like that,&quot; counters Tsutomu Yamada,deputy director of the Fair Trade Commission's generalaffairs division. He says the commission is conducting moreinvestigations in general and that &quot;just by chance&quot; someforeign firms get caught in the dragnet. Most of thecommission's investigations aren't publicized, and Mr. Yamadadeclined to say what percentage involve foreign-basedcompanies.   In the year ended March 31, the commission handled 270cases, 50% more than the year before. Three days after theMaster Foods case, the group launched a potentiallyfar-reaching investigation into Japan's cement industry forallegedly setting up an illegal cartel. Also, as part of itsU.S.-instigated reforms, the commission is setting up aspecial section to handle complaints from foreign firms.   On the books, Japan's antitrust laws are officially thesame as in the U.S., but the application is different. From1985 to 1988, according to a U.S. Justice Department study,the U.S. government found fault in 30% of the cases itinvestigated, while the Japanese government took action inonly 5% of its cases. The average fine in the U.S. was eighttimes as large as in Japan.   Japan's relatively lax antitrust enforcement is one ofseveral issues under discussion in the Structural ImpedimentsInitiative, the term given to current bilateral negotiationson how to trim the $49 billion U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance.   A fundamental U.S. philosophy in the talks is that pricesare higher in Japan than in the rest of the industrializedworld. In the U.S. view, this proves that Japan's isessentially a less competitive market.   The Japanese, however, are increasingly sensitive toassertions they are anything but a normal free-marketeconomy. Last September, shortly after the talks began, theJapanese government produced a study concluding that priceswere higher in the U.S. than in Japan. The U.S. poked holesin the methodology, and the two sides did a joint study.Two-thirds of the 122 goods examined cost more in Japan. Ofthose, half cost 50% more.   In January, the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry released its own study, which concluded that theaverage profit-to-sales ratio of foreign companies in Japanin 1988 was 6.8%, compared with 2.8% for Japanese firms.   Some foreign government and business officials concedethat they use higher markups in Japan. In Japan,&quot;distributors, dealers, shops have always said that if animported product is the same price as Japanese products, itwill not sell,&quot; says Luciano Cohen, chairman of the Councilof the European Business Community in Japan. &quot;They tell youthe price should be higher if you want to sell it.&quot;   U.S. officials complain that the Japanese reports aredistorted, focusing on an unrepresentative sampling offoreign companies, mainly importers of name brands and luxurygoods.</TEXT></DOC>
