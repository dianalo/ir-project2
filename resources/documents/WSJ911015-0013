The freeze won't eliminate the payment ofperformance-based bonuses, which are part of totalcompensation, said a spokesman for the defense-electronicsgiant and missile maker.</LP><TEXT>   Hughes also will delay by four months, until July, theannual reviews of other salaried employees. Hughes has about55,000 such employees and about 10,000 hourly employees,mostly in Southern California. Hourly workers, most of whomare covered by union contracts, aren't affected by the plans.   Malcolm R. Currie, the unit's chairman and chief executiveofficer, announced the moves in a letter distributed toemployees. &quot;The continuing cutbacks in the defense budgetoutlined by President Bush will be greater than had beenanticipated and have introduced further uncertainty into ourbusiness.&quot;   Two years ago, when military contracts accounted for 80%of Hughes's business, the company launched an effort todiversify into non-military markets. The target now is toachieve an equal mix of military and commercial business by1996, a Hughes spokesman said. Three months ago, Hughesannounced a restructuring to facilitate the shift.</TEXT></DOC>
