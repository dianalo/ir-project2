Palazio estimated that about 3,500 front line Sandinista forcesaided by 4,000 backup troops were involved.   In Managua, Nicaraguan officials confirmed that a ``majormilitary offensive'' had been launched, but denied that Sandinistaforces had penetrated into Honduran territory.   The operation occurred less than a week before the rescheduledresumption of cease-fire talks and some Democrats in Congresspictured it as a Sandinista attempt to go into the negotiationsfrom a stronger position.   One State Department official, speaking on condition he not beidentified, said initial reports suggested the Sandinistas hoped todeliver a ``knockout blow'' against the Contras.   The military engagements came shortly after a 1{-hour WhiteHouse meeting at which President Reagan pleaded with congressionalleaders for a renewal of American aid to the Contras, but met anicy reception from Democrats.   Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said Reaganpounded the table and said, ``There are some people around thistable who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.''   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the Sandinistas'Soviet-made Antonov planes dropped 500 to 1,000-pound bombs onContra troop concentrations.   He said Contra air resupply capability is extremely limited. Therebels are low on food and lack the ability to evacuate theirwounded, he said.   In Miami, Marta Sacasa, another spokesman for the resistance,said the Sandinistas struck at Contra positions with heavyartillery, including multiple rocket launchers.   ``The situation is critical,'' she said.   The State Department said earlier that preparations bygovernment forces appeared to foreshadow ``the largest offensive wehave seen the Sandinistas undertake.''   But House Democratic aides, also speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the offensive by Sandinista troops was merely``business as usual'' and an attempt to ``soften up'' the Contrasbefore the cease-fire negotiations resume.   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., acknowledged that``there is some military activity'' in the country, but declined toelaborate.   ``We don't know their intentions, and they (the administration)don't know their intentions,'' said one Democratic congressionalsource.   Another Democratic congressional source said it was clear thatthe Contras are having supply problems, in part because of anadministration decision to spend the last aid money on long-termtruck and air delivery contracts, anticipating that a House-drafted``humanitarian'' aid package would be approved. Instead, thepackage was voted down on March 3.   After the White House session, House Speaker Jim Wright saidReagan's plea for a renewal of aid puzzled him.   ``It doesn't really seem to make total sense,'' Wright, D-Texas,said.   He said it was House Republicans, acting in concert with Reagan,who defeated a $30 million package of food and clothing for therebels two weeks ago, just after their U.S. aid pipeline had rundry.   He expressed ``amazement'' that Reagan would cheer the defeat ofthat package, then two weeks later come to Congress with an urgentrequest for new supplies. ``I can't conceive of it,'' Wright said.   Wright quoted Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell,as telling congressional leaders that ``virtually all aspects'' ofthe Contra effort are ``in crisis and on the verge of collapse,that food for the Contra families will run out the first of April.The program is drying up and dying before our very eyes.''   In December, 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery poundedSandinista soldiers who mounted an incursion into Honduras toattack Contra bases. On that occasion, U.S. Army helicopters werebrought in to ferry Honduran infantrymen to the front.   At that time, Honduras charged that 800 to 2,500 Sandinistasoldiers crossed the border and penetrated up to nine miles intoHonduras before returning to Nicaragua about a week later.   Since U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29 and the House votednarrowly on March 3 against a new ``humanitarian'' aid package, theContras have fallen back toward border areas to defend supplycaches, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said. That means``they cannot use normal guerrilla tactics to disperse and escapesuperior Sandinista firepower and manpower being brought to bear onthem,'' he said.   Wright said he did not know the extent of any Sandinistapreparations, but said he has ``earnestly implored'' the Managuagovernment to act in good faith. He said his message for theSandinistas was: ``You are in a position of strength. Do not abusethat strength.''   Democratic House leaders said they had offered to revive the $30million ``humanitarian'' aid proposal they had offered on March 3,but got no immediate response from White House officials. They saidif they were to revive the package, it would be only with theguaranteed backing of GOP members who opposed it the last timearound.   But Wright appeared unwilling to budge on the central issue ofwhether any aid package would include the right for the president,under certain conditions, to ask for and get a quick, guaranteedcongressional vote on additional military aid for the rebels.   ``The bottom line is ... members are not willing to vote foranother expedited procedure,'' as the guaranteed vote is called, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
