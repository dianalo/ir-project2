In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Fibreboard soared $2.125 to $12.25.    The wood products and ski-resort concern said the payments will be made on an interim basis, subject to legal appeals. Under the agreement, Continental Casualty will pay, within certain limitations on amount, defense costs and 40% of the indemnity costs on claims defended or settled after Sept. 1. The payments could then be adjusted one way or another depending on the outcome of appeals.    In addition, Fibreboard said it will receive an unspecified payment on its claims liabilities outstanding. The company said it will drop its other claims against the insurer, including allegations of bad faith.    The agreement is subject to preparation of a definitive agreement and necessary corporate approvals, the company said.    Fibreboard also announced certain changes to its structured settlement program. Under the changes, Fibreboard agreed that holders of structured settlement obligations will receive certain creditor protections, including limitations on dividends and aggregate indebtedness and prohibitions of certain reorganizations and related party transactions.    In addition, Fibreboard said its board authorized the company to enter into agreements with asbestos claimants under which Fibreboard would resolve claims by expedited binding arbitration, at the option of the claimants. </TEXT></DOC>
