In an interview, A. Clark Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said higher natural gas prices, improved ethylene margins and lower interest expenses contributed to the earnings surge, while a drop in crude oil prices was an &quot;unfavorable&quot; factor.    As of March 31, Union Texas had cash on hand of $149 million and available credit of $261 million. The company's management is requesting board approval for an initial common dividend payout of five cents a share, payable in May.    For the year-ago quarter, Union Texas reported net of $24 million, or 16 cents a share, with 67 million shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding for the latest quarter were about 85 million. Revenue rose 8% for the quarter to about $352 million from $326 million.    Even though prices for the industry are down this month because of seasonal factors, &quot;a couple of high-price, long-term contracts&quot; and a 36% increase in volume boosted Union Texas' natural gas results for the quarter, Mr. Johnson said. The company's reserves are about two-thirds gas and one-third oil.    &quot;Ethylene margins have quadrupled to 12 cents a pound from three cents a pound,&quot; reflecting strong demand for plastic pipes and containers, he said. The ethylene business accounts for about 15% of Union Texas's total operations. Mr. Johnson said Union Texas is expanding ethylene capacity by about 4%.    Late last year, Mr. Johnson said Union Texas was budgeting for oil prices to average $18 a barrel through 1988. Even though prices have been much lower, Union Texas doesn't plan to change capital spending plans or staffing levels, primarily because of the strong results from other businesses. Planned capital spending for 1988 remains at $218 million compared with about $165 million for 1987.    Union Texas is 39%-owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment partnership. When Kohlberg sought clearance to buy a 15% stake in Texaco Inc. last week, there was Wall Street speculation that Kohlberg might be interested in certain Texaco assets for Union Texas. Mr. Johnson said Union Texas &quot;hasn't made any study of Texaco.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
