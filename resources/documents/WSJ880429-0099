In the first four months of the year, the telecommunications giant's holders have had to endure setback after setback as the stock met resistance to any steady price rise. ATandamp;T stock hasn't come close to regaining any of the luster of last summer, when it rose to a high of 35 7/8.    The phone company hasn't lost all its supporters, though, and some think the stock may be oversold, even if a sudden turnaround is unlikely. &quot;I think ATandamp;T is in the best shape financially and strategically they've ever been,&quot; says Jack B. Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber and a former ATandamp;T employee. &quot;I view ATandamp;T as a company that has a dominant franchise in a growing industry.&quot;    That optimism contrasts with some recent lowlights:   --First, many on Wall Street turned bearish over the question of how far the Federal Communications Commission plans to go to revamp the rules under which the company can compete and price its services.    --Then early last week, ATandamp;T's chairman and chief executive officer, James E. Olson, died three weeks after undergoing surgery for colon cancer.    --And this week, Vittorio Cassoni, who was to be in charge of turning around ATandamp;T's costly venture into computers, bailed out to rejoin Ing. C. Olivetti.    All the while, ATandamp;T shares have lagged even the other big-capitalization stocks. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ATandamp;T closed at 26 3/8, off 1/4 for the session and down about 5/8 since the beginning of the year. During that period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 100 points.    Mr. Grubman shrugs off the setbacks. &quot;It's not hard to figure why the stock is under some pressure,&quot; he says. &quot;This is the time to buy this stock.&quot;    One Shearson Lehman Hutton trader, Rodd Anderson, isn't expecting much of a turnaround soon. &quot;It's going to take some time,&quot; he says. &quot;You're not going to retire on the capital gain you're going to get on this stock in the next few years.&quot;    The next few months are critical for ATandamp;T. In May, the FCC is expected to float another trial balloon on regulating the company. The commission's initial proposal -- which would have changed restrictions on ATandamp;T from profit-based to price-based -- ignited the stock last summer.    Under that proposal, the company would have the flexibility to earn whatever it could if it stayed within certain pricing guidelines -- a stunning incentive to become leaner and meaner.    Several analysts said they expect the FCC proposal to be taken up by Congress and the issue to be resolved before the end of the year. Mr. Grubman predicts that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will have its hands full studying the possible dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act and the activities of Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond chief Michael Milken, among other issues, and that it won't spend much time debating the matter.    That could speed the process considerably and allow a more favorable FCC proposal to pass.    But until investors get a better feel for how the rule will turn out, &quot;ATandamp;T stock is probably going to languish,&quot; says Larry Weissman, assistant investment officer at College Retirement Equities Fund, New York.    One analyst, Prudential-Bache Securities' Robert B. Morris III, isn't sure that changing the company's regulatory structure is the solution. ATandamp;T's bigger problem, he says, is that &quot;they just have too much investment relative to their market share.&quot;    Although Mr. Morris favors slimming down the company, ATandamp;T plans to spend $6 billion in the next two years to enhance its long-distance network, a system already valued at $9.5 billion. But the company's long-distance market share has slipped steadily in the face of competition from MCI Communications and others, he says.    That's even more reason to buy the stock, the unshakable Mr. Grubman responds. &quot;It's not like General Motors, where losing 10 points of market share can hurt,&quot; he says, adding that ATandamp;T carried over two billion minutes more of calls in the first quarter than it did in the year-earlier period.    For investors, though, the major question remains how the new chairman, Robert E. Allen, and computer chief, Robert Kavner, will perform. Both get high marks from outsiders, but many analysts still are skittish about recommending the stock.    &quot;The market is much less willing to pay up for the future, because now the future is called into question,&quot; Mr. Morris says.    But Mr. Grubman expects the stock to reach $40 a share within 18 months. &quot;If I can get a company at three times cash flow and 10 times next year's earnings that has a huge franchise, I'll buy it,&quot; he says.    ---   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph   (NYSE; Symbol: T)   Business: Telecommunications   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenues: $33.6 bilion   Net income: $2.04 billion; or $1.88 a share   First quarter, March 31, 1988:   Per-share earnings: 46 cents vs. 40 cents   Average daily trading volume:   1,755,046 shares   Common shares outstanding:   1.07 billion</TEXT></DOC>
