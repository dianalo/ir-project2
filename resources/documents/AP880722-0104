H.P. Vibbert, pastor of Abundant LifeMemorial church, who has been a friend of Swaggart since the 1960s.``To have a fellow minister come to the city and conduct such acrusade and not even be able to support it.''   Swaggart's crusade, which ends Sunday, is his first outsideLouisiana since the fiery TV evangelist was dismissed April 8 bythe Assemblies of God for refusing to abide by punishment imposedby the church for moral wrongdoing.   In February, Swaggart tearfully confessed to a TV audience thathe had committed an unspecified sin against God and his family.Debra Murphree, a prostitute, later said Swaggart had hired her topose nude and once had sex with her.   The Assemblies of God ordered Swaggart to refrain from preachingfor a year, but Swaggart returned to the pulpit after three months,saying his multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survivethe suspension.   The Rev. Mike Baldock, pastor of the independent New CovenantChurch and organizer of the crusade here, has said he believesabout 8,000 people will attend each of the three meetings thisweekend.   Baldock said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500volunteers, 200 ushers and a security force.   Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at Assemblies of God headquartersin Springfield, Mo., said individual pastors must decide whether tosupport the crusade.   Officials of the Northwest Assembly of God Church here decidednot to cooperate in any way, said Lucille Sexton, an aide to theRev. Blanche Fiscus. Pastors have been instructed to have nothingto do with Swaggart's activities here, she added.   ``I choose not to go simply for the awkwardness of beingthere,'' Vibbert said. ``If I were there, I would feel I ought tobe with him on the platform, so I choose not to go.   ``My human instinct would be to go down and stand behind him andsupport him. But as an Assembly of God pastor I cannot cooperatewith the crusade without contradicting the directions of theexecutive presbytery.''   Vibbert has been neutral on the issue with his congregation,neither encouraging nor discouraging attendance.   As for Swaggart, Vibbert said, ``We're still friends. Thatrelationship, as far as I'm concerned, has not been severed. We'repraying for Jimmy.''</TEXT></DOC>
