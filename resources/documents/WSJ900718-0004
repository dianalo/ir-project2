The poor showing by Sprint, the nation's third-largestlong-distance service provider, stunned Wall Street analysts,who had been expecting a much smaller decline and had cuttheir estimates for the company last month.</LP><TEXT>   United took a charge of $72 million, or 18 cents a share,to cover a 5% cut in Sprint's work force, a write-off ofoutdated software used in the company's computers andaccruals for certain contract disputes.   &quot;Obviously the Street got blindsided,&quot; said PaineWebberInc. analyst Jack B. Grubman, who along with numerous otheranalysts had cut his estimates in June. &quot;This is a materialchange in the company's earnings situation.&quot;   &quot;More important than the operating loss,&quot; said analystRobert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., is that without thecharge, Sprint's operating profit would have been $30million, which is &quot;at a minimum $60 million away from whatthe market was expecting.&quot;   Profit at United Telecom, based in Kansas City, Mo., fellto $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share, from $90.5 million, or43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12% to $2.07billion from $1.85 billion.   The company's stock dropped $8.75 to $29.50 on heavy NewYork Stock Exchange composite volume of more than 11.8million shares.   United Telecom had planned to buy the rest of Sprint fromGTE Corp. by September. Now, a spokesman for United Telecomsaid that while the company would like to buy GTE's 19.9%stake this year, the purchase could be put off until nextyear or until Sprint's profit improves.   William T. Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, pegged Sprint's showing to severecompetition in the lower end of the long-distance market:residential and small-business customers. Results fromservice provided to large corporate users are meetingexpectations, he said.   Sprint will be &quot;shifting considerable additional peopleinto sales and marketing,&quot; Mr. Esrey said, and will pareabout 1,000 support and other staffers from its 20,000-memberwork force.   Analysts said Sprint is losing market share -- revenuegrew just 2% in the second quarter from the first period --to American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the nation's No. 2carrier, MCI Communications Corp. &quot;Starting in the fourthquarter, MCI literally attacked the market,&quot; hiring some 500sales and marketing people, said Mr. Morris, adding that ATandamp;T&quot;was right there, toe to toe&quot; with MCI.   Even more worrisome was Sprint's lack of control over itscosts, noted Mr. Grubman of PaineWebber. &quot;Sprint spent $80million more in the quarter to get about $25 million more inrevenue,&quot; he said. That's not going to change. &quot;With the lossin revenue momentum, they're going to have to spend even moreon sales and marketing to win customers back.&quot;   Mr. Esrey said &quot;we haven't reacted as fast as we shouldhave to competitive pressures.&quot; He added, &quot;I look at this asa serious setback&quot; but one that the company is addressingaggressively. All areas will be targeted for cost cuts, hesaid, declining to elaborate.   The company's local phone operations were comparativelyrobust, posting 10% higher operating profit on a 4% revenuerise; the business is &quot;performing quite well,&quot; Mr. Esreysaid. The parent's complementary businesses, including adirectory publisher and an equipment unit, saw 8.3% higherprofit on 2% more revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
