The bill the president signed late Tuesday provides $3.8 billionin fiscal year 1990 for Star Wars, also known as the StrategicDefense Initiative, and less than the administration requested forthe B-2 stealth bomber program.   Working from a stack of legislation approved by Congress as itrushed to leave town for the year, Bush also signed:   _A measure to guarantee reparations to Japanese-Americansinterned in U.S. camps during World War II. The provision, part ofa $17.2 billion appropriation for the State, Justice and Commercedepartments, contains no money for the estimated 60,000 campsurvivors but says up to $500 million would be provided as an``entitlement'' in 1991.   Congress has authorized $20,000 for each survivor, a total of$1.2 billion.   _A ban on smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights, anexpansion of current rules forbidding passengers from lighting upon routes lasting two hours or less. The new regulations takeeffect 96 days after signing, which would be Feb. 25.   _A $44 billion spending bill for agriculture, rural developmentand other programs, including soup kitchens for the homeless andfunds for the Food and Drug Administration's fight against AIDS.   _The $157 billion labor, health and education appropriationsbill, stripped of abortion provisions that prompted a veto earlier.   _The $3.4 billion District of Columbia appropriations bill, alsostripped of abortion provisions to which the president objected andwhich led to yet another earlier veto.   The defense bill provides $1.1 billion less than Bush requestedfor this year for the Star Wars program, the first budget reductionin the program in its six-year history.   Bush said he was disappointed by the cut and expressed hope thatCongress would support the administration's future requests.   The measure provides $4.3 billion for two B-2 stealth bombers,$430 million and one plane less than the administration sought inthe fiscal year that began Oct. 1.   The money also will be used for some advance procurement costsfor five planes to be bought in fiscal 1991 and for spare parts.   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for the 10-warhead,rail-based MX and the single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman nuclearmissiles.   The amount is about $150 million less than the administrationrequested for the two weapons and includes House language imposinga 50-missile cap on the MX.</TEXT></DOC>
