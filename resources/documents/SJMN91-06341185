It couldn't have happened to a more deserving pilot.;  Keating was a financial predator, a species that crawled out of the muck ofthe deregulated 1980s and flourished -- using little people's money -- untilthe bills came due. His conviction on 17 of 18 counts of securities fraud isan indictment of that decade.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KEATING'S 10-YEAR DEBTTHE FINANCIAL PREDATOR'S CONVICTION INDICTS THEDEREGULATED 1980S  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Keating was also a disciple of the Big Lie. He repeated it countless times:The collapse of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan was not his fault -- incompetentregulators stepped in and brought down a thriving enterprise.;   Keating waspartly right. The regulators were incompetent. But what they brought down wasan ostentatious house of cards -- two years too late. Their delay in stoppingthe hemorrhaging contributed to making Lincoln the nation's worst savings andloan debacle. The bill to taxpayers: about $2.6 billion.;   Amid the Keatingwreckage there were also passengers, including a California senator, theonce-respected Alan Cranston. Keating made $1.3 million in donations to fivesenators' campaign committees and to causes they supported. Not surprisingly,they tried to help Keating when regulators moved to take over Lincoln Savingsandamp; Loan. Cranston's intervention was the most blatant.;   In 1989, commentingon whether his contributions influenced the senators, Keating said: &quot;Icertainly hope so.&quot; On his arrogance alone he deserved to be convicted.;   Butthe jurors went beyond that and decided a complicated case on the evidence.Now Keating faces up to a 10-year sentence. He'll appeal, of course -- it willgive him another forum in which to tell the Big Lie.;   Besides the hugebailout bill that remains to be paid, there's not much left but ashes. Ifanything can rise from them, it should be a renewed skepticism. The nearly20,000 investors, many of them retirees, who bought $250 million worth of junkbonds from Keating's company believed him. They didn't read the fine print.The bonds were not insured by the federal government, though Lincoln salesmenimplied they were safe.;   It's unfair to put any blame on the victims, to besure, but there is a lesson to be learned: When an investment adviser promisesyou the moon -- a safe 15 percent return -- look for the craters.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  380  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 6, 199100341185,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
