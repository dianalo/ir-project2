Background  </ITAG>The DoD FAR Supplement is codified in Chapter 2, Title 48 of the Code ofFederal Regulations.  The October 1, 1987 revision of the CFR is the most recent edition of thattitle. It reflects amendments to the 1987 edition of the DoD FAR Supplementmade by Defense Acquisition Circulars 86-1 through 86-5.  Interested parties may submit proposed revisions to this Supplement directlyto the DAR Council. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Public Comments </ITAG>DAC 86-7, Items I, II, III, V, and VII through XIII  Public comments were not solicited with respect to these revisions sincesuch revisions (a) do not alter the substantive meaning of any coveragein the DFARS having a significant impact on contractors or offerors, or(b) do not have a significant effect beyond agency internal operating procedures;or compelling reasons required issuance of an interim rule without priorpublication for public comment. DAC 86-7, Item IV  A proposed rule with request for comments was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 20, 1986 (51 FR 37205). DAC 86-7, Item VI  A proposed rule with request for comments was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 13, 1985 (51 FR 46796).<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>DAC 86-7, Items I, III through VI and Items VIII through XIIIThese revisions are not ``significant revisions'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., they do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theDFARS having a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations, solicitation of agency and public views on theserevisions is not required. Since such solicitation is not required, theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) does not apply.DAC 86-7, Item IIThe Department of Defense certifies that this final rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. Although therule contains a requirement to display DoD Hotline posters, this requirementonly applies to contractors who receive an award amounting to $5 millionor more and who do not meet the criteria for exception contained in therule. Approximately 454 contracts exceeding $5 million were awarded tosmall businesses in 1986. Small businesses receiving such awards and notmeeting the exception criteria will be required on a one-time basis toobtain free copies of the DoD Hotline poster from the DoD Inspector General'soffice in Washington, DC and to display such posters.DAC #86-7, Item VIIThe final rule will apply to approximately 1,500 small businesses usingGovernment property under DoD contracts. The impact on small businessesshould be minimal since most are in compliance with the final rule. Theproposed requirement to report additions and deletions of specific categoriesof property from the contract will require some small businesses to revisetheir Government property control system, but the businesses affected andchanges required should be small in number. A Final Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has been prepared and submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacyfor the Small Business Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>DAC 86-7, Items I through VI and Items VIII through XIIIThe Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because these final rules donot contain information collection requirements which require the approvalof OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.DAC 86-7, Item VIIOn October 21, 1986, the Office of Management and Budget approved a paperworkburden increase of 38,000 hours to OMB Number 0704-0246 as a result ofa deviation (DAR Case 86-931) to allow use of this coverage. This ruledoes not change the reporting requirements approved on October 21, 1986.Another Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, therefore, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 201, 202, 204, 205, 208, 209, 213,214, 215, 224, 225, 228, 231, 233, 235, 245, 247, 252, and 253</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W.

Therefore,DAR Supplement No. 2 is cancelled, and the Table of Contents is revisedaccordingly.Item II_Self-Governance (DoD Hotline)A new Subpart 203.70 is added to implement certain recommendations madeby the President's Commission on Defense Management concerning contractorself-governance programs and debarment and suspension. The new coverageadopts a policy which promotes rather than mandates the establishment ofcontractor programs to improve compliance with law, regulations, and contractcommitments, and provides criteria for responsibility determinations insuspension and debarment decisions. A related change is made to DFARS 209.406.The coverage also includes a clause that, when inserted in contracts, willrequire contractors to display DoD Hotline posters unless the contractorhas established a mechanism, such as a hotline, by which employees mayreport suspected instances of improper conduct, and instructions that encourageemployees to make such reports. These changes were published as a finalrule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 11, 1987 (52 FR 34386).Item III_Restrictions on the Purchase of Petroleum Products Originatingin AngolaDFARS 225.7 is revised to implement section 316 of the FY 1987 DoD AuthorizationAct, Pub. L. 99-661. This coverage provides guidance with respect to restrictionson the purchase of petroleum products originating in Angola.

Related changes are made in 201.103 and 245.603. A proposed rulewas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 20, 1986 (51 FR 37205). After reviewof comments received, the DAR Council concluded that the language containedin the proposed rule was consistent with the above-cited Public Law, anddid not adopt the recommended changes.Item V_Disputes and AppealsDFARS Subpart 233.2 is revised to add spacecraft and launch vehicles tothe list of acquisitions that must use the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes,with its Alternate I, in recognition that these acquisitions are vitalto the national defense and, thus, a contractor's refusal to continue performance,based upon a contract dispute with the Government, could cause seriousfinancial damage and jeopardize national security. The clause prescriptivelanguage previously located at 233.213 has been relocated to 233.214.Item VI_Randamp;D Contracting_Cost Sharing PolicyDRARS 235.003 is revised to delete obsolete reference to Federal ManagementCircular, FMC 73-3, and further to recognize the fact that cost sharingwith educational institutions and nonprofit organizations is not normallyappropriate in view of their nonprofit status and limited ability to recovercost participation from non-government sources. These changes were publishedas a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24473), and a correctionwas published on July 28, 1987 (52 FR 28148).Item VII_DoD Property in the Custody of ContractorsDFARS 245.5 is revised to expand the reporting requirement for DoD propertyin the custody of contractors. Under this reporting system, contractorswill be requested to report information in a different format. DD Form1662 will be used to collect the information required.

Related changes aremade to DFARS (DAR) Supplement No. 3. A proposed rule was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25614). After reviewingthe comments, the DAR Council amended the proposed rule by changing thereport due date to the Government from October 20 to October 31 of eachyear. A final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 22, 1987 (52 FR 39535).<ITAG tagnum="21">[<T4>Editorial note. </T4>DD Forms are not published in the Code of FederalRegulations.]</ITAG>Item VIII_Government Property_Plant Clearance ProceduresDFARS 245.606-5(e), Instructions for Completing Specific Forms, has beenexpanded regarding completion of Standard Form 1432, Inventory ScheduleD, to include data on termination inventory.

DFARS 245.608-2 has been addedto include guidance regarding screening of the procuring and requiringdepartments. Guidance has been included in 245.608-5(d) and 245.608-70(d)to clarify screening with the Defense Automation Resources InformationCenter and the Contractor Inventory Redistribution System. Regarding salesof surplus contractor inventory, 245.610-1 is revised to clarify that purchaseor retention of contractor-acquired property is not subject to the approvalof the plant clearance officer. DFARS 245.7101-10 is added to address useof DD Form 1637. DFARS 245.7102-4 is revised to correct present coverage.Additional coverage at 245.7102-7 has been added regarding preparationof this form. DD Form 1641 has been revised for clarity.Item IX_Preparation of Personal Property for Shipment or StorageAt the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, ReserveAffairs, and Logistics), a joint service committee drafted a model performancework statement (PWS) for the acquisition of personal property packing andcontainerization services. This model PWS has been tested at several DoDmilitary installations since 1983. The PWS has been established as thesingle format for the procurement of the above-mentioned services. DFARS247.271 has been revised and corresponding clauses in 252.247 have beendeleted from the DFARS to accommodate the PWS. The deleted material willbe incorporated in the PWS by an amendment to the DoD Personal PropertyTraffic Management Regulation (DoD 4500.34-R).Item X_Cancellation of DD Form 558-1, Bidder's Mailing List ApplicationSupplementThe DAR Council has determined that DD Form 558-1 is no longer needed.Use of the form is discontinued and the form is deleted from the DFARS.Item XI_Cancellation of DD Form 1660, Management Systems Summary ListThe DAR Council has determined that DD Form 1660 is no longer useful.
