(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the second part of a series on IBM's AS/400 midrange family ofcomputers.andP;  The AS/400 is an important component of IBM's strategy to providegreatly enhanced consistency and connectivity across multiple supportedenvironments.andM;The AS/400 has been an immediate market success, even though its fullcapability is just beginning to be understood.andP;  This week, I'll examine thekeys to its success, as well as its limits.andM;Some reasons why the AS/400 is so popular include the following:andM;-- System/3X compatibility.andP;  IBM stopped most of its development work on theSystem/36 and System/38 in the summer of 1986 and focused on the AS/400.andP;  Bymid-1988, many of the 350,000 System/3X users were ready for something newerand better.andP;  The AS/400's ability to run System/3X applications with alimited conversion effort ensured it an initial surge of orders fromSystem/3X users primed for an upgrade.andM;-- Database capability.andP;  The AS/400 is a database computer, not ageneral-purpose computer to which database-management software has beenadded.andP;  As a result, it offers advanced relational database features withoutthe performance degradation normally associated with relational processing.andM;-- Cost of ownership.andP;  The combination of AS/400 architecture and featuresmakes it a very affordable computer, particularly when the cost of supportfunctions (systems programming, database support, network management,operations and software) are  considered.andM;-- Downsizing option.andP;  Some organizations, particularly those faced with anexpensive conversion from IBM's DOS/VSE to the MVS operating system, areswitching to networked AS/400s.andM;-- Advanced architecture.andP;  The AS/400 incorporates all of the innovativefeatures of the System/38 architecture, including a high-level machineinterface, object orientation, single-level addressability, a large addressspace, integrated system software and a machine-integrated relationaldatabase-management system (DBMS).andM;-- Ease of use.andP;  The AS/400 offers a great deal of capability without theneed for numerous complex interfaces.andM;-- Availability of applications.andP;  System/3X compatibility allowed the morethan 8,000 application packages available for System/3X to be rapidlyavailable on the AS/400.andM;-- Connectivity.andP;  The AS/400 is easy to connect to other IBM computers and toa wide variety of non-IBM computers and devices.andP;  Connectivity withIBM-compatible PCs is especially strong.andP;  Support for Systems NetworkArchitecture (SNA) LU 6.2 is provided by Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications, which gives AS/400 users a flexible and simple-to-use methodfor building networks of computers.andM;-- First major implementation of SAA.andP;  IBM has made it clear that the set ofstandards called Systems Application Architecture (SAA) will form thefoundation for future software products.andM;The AS/400 provides more SAA capabilities than any other computerenvironment, and its advanced architecture offers a more practical andworkable approach to relational processing.andP;  Although the current relationaldatabase lacks some important features (such as relational integrity), theDBMS more than makes up for this by being affordable and easy to use.andM;Compared with traditional systems, the AS/400 provides an integratedsystem-software structure.andP;  As illustrated, traditional systems provideseparate system-software packages for graphics, basic office, security,communications, database and so on.andP;  The AS/400 combines these softwarelayers into one comprehensive system-software module identical for allmodels, which makes it possible to offer high functionality withoutunnecessary complexity.andM;The AS/400's design makes it unlikely that its users will faceoperating-system conversions or similar problems as the system matures duringthe 1990s.andP;  The design also provides for the introduction of new technologysuch as optical storage and large solid-state memories without affectingapplications design.andM;Problems and LimitationsandM;Overall, the AS/400 has met or exceeded its original design objectives;however, a few problems have yet to be resolved satisfactorily.andP;  The AS/400'scurrent limits include the following:andM;-- Missing SAA languages.andP;  Not available yet are C, FORTRAN, SAA ControlLanguage (REXX), Cross System Product (CSP) and SAA Query (QMF).andP;  Support forC and an execution-only version of CSP are likely to be available in 1989,and the remaining languages no later than mid-1990.andM;-- Tape-backup devices.andP;  The fastest backup tape currently offered is the IBM2440, which isn't fast enough to back up very large disk configurations (morethan 10 gigabytes) in a reasonable time.andP;  The faster 3422 has been announcedfor the AS/400, but it won't be available until the fourth quarter.andM;-- Recovery.andP;  The recovery from complete failure of a disk drive can becomplex and slow.andP;  This is caused by the way in which single-leveladdressability is implemented.andP;  If a disk drive fails and cannot be read,it's necessary to reconstruct the contents of all disk drives.andM;A number of optional facilities are available to reduce the risk of needingto completely rebuild all disk files.andP;  For example, the option of ChecksumProtection offers significant protection, but there's an associated overhead,and recovery time is often a matter of hours.andM;-- On-line transaction processing.andP;  The recovery limitations of the AS/400make it impractical now for certain critical transaction-processingapplications that require high availability.andM;-- Fault tolerance.andP;  The AS/400 is currently impractical to use in certainsituations where either fault tolerance or very high availability isrequired.andM;-- Technical computing.andP;  The AS/400 currently lacks hardware floating-pointcapability, so it can't be used for number-intensive computing.andP;  Thislimitation may be resolved by IBM during 1989.andM;-- System/36 mode performance.andP;  Although the facility that allows the AS/400to run System/36 applications after a simple migration is generally quiteeffective, it does require more computer resources than if System/36applications had been written to take full advantage of the AS/400.andM;-- Entry price.andP;  The cost of owning even a small AS/400 is well over $50,000(in most cases this includes hardware, system software, applicationssoftware, training and so on).andP;  A lower entry price is needed to bridge thegap between PC solutions and the current low end of the AS/400 line.andM;-- Application-development tools.andP;  There are relatively few good toolsavailable for application development on the AS/400.andM;-- Connectivity with 3270 workstations.andP;  It can be difficult to createnetworks with both AS/400 and System/370 systems if the workstations on theSystem/370 systems include older 3270-type workstations.andP;  Often, the mostsignificant problem is the limitation of the 3270's keyboard.andM;-- Support of non-SNA devices.andP;  The AS/400 currently lacks connectivity tomany non-SNA devices, such as certain Unix workstations, Macintosh computersor other devices that use the TCP/IP protocols.andM;-- Office automation.andP;  The AS/400 was announced with an adequate -- but notsuperior -- office-automation capability.andP;  The AS/400 Office functions willbe enhanced through the availability of the IBM OfficeVision Family of officeproducts announced last week.andP;  However, these new office products will notlikely be fully available until mid-1990.andM;Next week, I'll evaluate the AS/400 as an alternative to the widely used IBMSystem/370 architecture.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
