Sincethe PFCRA contemplated that the participating agencies promulgate substantiallysimilar regulations, this regulation is, in large part, identical to amodel developed for the participating agencies by a Task Force headed bythe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and amended pursuantto public comment. The rule establishes administrative procedures for imposingthe statutorily authorized penalties against any person who makes, submits,or presents a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim or written statementto the Small Business Administration (SBA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2> EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> February 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Patricia R. Forbes, Chief Counselfor Legislation, (202) 653-6573.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The structure of a PFCRA procedureunder this regulation may be described as follows: The PFCRA authorizesinvestigations of false claims and statements by the Small Business Administration's(SBA) Inspector General (investigating official). Cases are initially referredto SBA's General Counsel (reviewing official) for evaluation and approval,then to the Attorney General for Department of Justice approval. The Departmentof Justice could elect to bring the case itself in court under the FalseClaims Act or other statutes, which would preclude SBA's further actionon the matter. If the Department of Justice approves the use of PFCRA procedures,the case may be referred to an ALJ for a formal hearing on the record.The PFCRA provides for an appeal of the ALJ's decision to SBA's Administratorand then to the U.S. District Court. On May 21, 1987 (52 FR 19156), SBA published a proposed rule and permitted30 days for the public to comment. SBA received no public comments; however,other agencies which proposed regulations based on the model did receivecomments. Those comments have been reviewed by the Task Force and the modelhas been amended in certain respects. In addition to adopting these changes,SBA has made certain changes to bring the regulation in line with existingSBA procedure. The following substantive changes were made to conform to the model rule.(See final rule published on April 8, 1988 by HHS for description of commentsand explanation of and basis for changes, 53 FR 11656.)Section 142.2 Definitions<T3> ``Administrator.''</T3> This definition was added to clarify that``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.<T3> ``Benefit.''</T3> This definition was amended to delete the phrase``except as the context otherwise requires'' and by substituting the phrase``in the context of `statements''' in response to comments that the definitionin the proposed rule was vague and overbroad.<T3> ``Person.''</T3> This definition was amended by adding the word ``or''before ``private'' and by deleting the phrase ``State, political subdivisionof a State, municipality, county, district, and Indian tribe'' in responseto comments that the statute does not permit inclusion of states and theirpolitical subdivisions in the definition of ``person.''<T3> ``Representative.''</T3> This definition was amended to specify that,in order to be a representative, an attorney must be a member in good standingof the bar of any State, or possession of the United States or of the Districtof Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Section 142.5 Review by the reviewing official Paragraph (6) of this section was amended to delete the final sentence.That sentence provided that a statement made by a reviewing official concerningreasonable prospect of collecting penalties may be based on informationthen known or an absence of any information indicating that the personmay be unable to pay such an amount. The result of this change is thatthe issue of what will constitute sufficient support for the reviewingofficial's statement will be left to the Department of Justice. Section 142.7 Complaint Paragraph (a) of this section was amended by inserting the words ``andprovide a copy to the Office of Hearings and Appeals'' after the word ``defendant.''This addition was made to ensure that the Office of Hearings and Appealsreceives copies of all complaints issued. Section 142.8 Service of complaint Paragraph (a) of this section was amended by deleting the final sentencewhich read ``Service is complete upon receipt.'' Inserted in its placeare the words ``Service is complete when made in accordance with the precedingsentence.'' This substitution was made to bring the regulations in linewith the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Section 142.9 Answer Paragraph (a) of this section was amended by inserting the words ``andthe Office of Hearings and Appeals'' after the word ``official.'' Thisaddition was made in order to notify the Office of Hearings and Appealsthat the defendant is seeking a hearing.Section 142.17 Rights of parties This section was amended by adding ``as permitted by the ALJ'' to the endof paragraph (h) to clarify that post-hearing briefs may be filed onlyat the discretion of the ALJ. Section 142.18 Authority of the ALJ Paragraph (c) of this section was amended to specify that the ALJ doesnot have the authority to find Federal statutes or regulations invalid.Section 142.20 Disclosure of documents Paragraph (b) of this section was amended by adding a sentence at the endof such paragraph which states ``The term `information' as used in thissection means factual data.'' Section 142.21 Discovery Paragraphs (e) (1), (2) and (3) of this section were amended to clarifythat subpoenas need be obtained only in cases where a party seeks to deposea non-party. A subpoena is unnecessary with respect to depositions of partiesbecause the ALJ can issue an order compelling discovery if a party refusesto be deposed. Paragraph (e)(4) of this section was amended by deleting the words ``andcopying'' at the end of the sentence. Copies of a deposition transcriptmay be obtained for a fee from the reporting service which prepared suchtranscript. Section 142.22 Exchange of witness lists, statements, and exhibits Paragraph (a) of this section was amended by deleting the words ``copiesof prior statements of proposed witnesses'' because such statements maywell be protected under the attorney work product privilege or the attorney-clientprivilege. SBA does recognize, however, that it must disclose such statementsif they are exculpatory. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 142.20. Section 142.26 Form, filing and service of papers Paragraph (b) of this section, <T3>Service, </T3>was amended to clarify that service upon any party otherthan those required to be served as prescribed in andSection; 142.8 shallbe made by delivering a copy or by placing a copy of the document in theUnited States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the party's lastknown address. Section 142.28 Motions Paragraph (d) of this section was amended by adding ``requests for extensionsof time'' to the list of circumstances under which an ALJ may grant a motionbefore the time period for reply has elapsed. SBA believes this changeis necessary to provide the ALJ discretion to grant extensions of timeimmediately. Section 142.31 Determining the amounts of penalties and assessments Paragraph (b)(7) of this section was amended by adding the words ``publicfinance'' after the word ``safety.'' The reason for such an amendment isto ensure that the potential or actual effect of misconduct affecting publicfinance will be considered when determining penalties. Section 142.33 Witnesses Paragraph (f)(2) of this section was amended to add the words ``appearingfor the entity pro se or'' after the words ``employee of the party'' forclarity. Section 142.35 The record Paragraph (a) of this section was amended by deleting the second sentencethereof because transcripts, if desired, should be obtained from the courtreporter. Section 142.36 Post-hearing briefs This section was amended by deleting the second sentence, which allowedparties to file post-hearing briefs at their will. Such filings will bepermitted only at the discretion of the ALJ. Section 142.37 Initial decision Paragraph (c) of this section was amended to substitute the word ``parties''for the word ``defendants'' in the second sentence in order to clarifythat the ALJ will serve all parties and not just defendants with a statementdescribing the right of any defendant determined to be liable to file amotion for reconsideration. Section 142.38 Reconsideration of initial decision Paragraph (f) of this section has been rewritten to clarify that if theALJ denies reconsideration, the initial decision shall be final and shallbe binding on the parties 30 days after the ALJ denies the motion, unlessthe initial decision is timely appealed to the Administrator in accordancewith andSection; 142.39 Paragraph (g) of this section has been rewritten to clarify that if theALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision shall be final andbinding on the parties 30 days after it is issued, unless timely appealedto the Administrator in accordance with andSection; 142.39. Section 142.39 Appeal to the administrator Paragraph (b)(1) of this section has been rewritten to clarify that anotice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days after the ALJissues an initial decision. However, if another party files a motion forreconsideration under andSection; 142.38, consideration of the appeal shallbe stayed automatically pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section has been amended to clarify that a partyis not obligated to file an appeal. Paragraph (b)(3) has been deleted to conform to the changes made in paragraph(b)(1). Paragraph (c) of this section has been amended to clarify that if a timelyappeal is filed, the ALJ will forward the record of the proceeding to theAdministrator after the time for filing motions for reconsideration hasexpired. Paragraph (k) of this section has been amended to specify that all partieswill be served with a statement describing the right of any person determinedto be liable for a penalty or assessment to seek judicial review. The formerlanguage provided only that the defendant would be served with such a statement.<ITAG tagnum="85"> Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, etseq., Executive Order 12291, and the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.Ch. 35</ITAG> SBA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Although the proceduresenable certain penalties to be assessed where false or fictitious statementshave been made to SBA, SBA does not anticipate that a substantial numberof small businesses will be affected by these procedures. In addition, SBA finds that this regulation is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291, as the procedures it establishes are not expectedto result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Sincethe PFCRA does not expand the investigative jurisdiction of the SBA, theeconomic effect of these procedural regulations is not expected to approachthe $100 million level. These procedural regulations do not require any additional reporting orrecordkeeping requirements which are subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct. SBA also certifies that this rule does not require a Federal Assessmentunder Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84"> List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 142</ITAG> Administrative practice and procedure, Investigations, Small businesses.
