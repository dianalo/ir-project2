While some executives at the Japanese firms regarded theSEC letters as &quot;fishing expeditions,&quot; others feared that theymight represent the beginning of a rigorous, lengthyinvestigation of the Japanese firms' activities by a majorenforcement agency known for its toughness.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the scandal took an unexpected twist in Japanas a religious group supporting a major opposition partyturned up on a list of compensation recipients publishedWednesday by 13 second-tier brokerage firms. In all, thefirms paid 43.69 billion yen ($316.8 million) in compensationto 385 clients.   The Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co.,Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and YamaichiSecurities Co. -- on Monday identified clients who receivedpaybacks totaling nearly $1 billion to compensate them forlosses suffered when Tokyo stock prices plunged in 1990.   In addition, Nomura and Nikko allegedly helped to financethe business dealings of a reputed gangster in what may haveinvolved the manipulation of the stock of Tokyu Corp., amajor Japanese railway, tourist and land development company.   Yesterday, the U.S. units of Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichiconfirmed that they had received letters from the SECrequesting the firms to voluntarily supply a lengthy list ofinformation, including their policies relating to protectingagainst securities violations and information about thecontinuing investigations of their parent companies in Tokyo.   People familiar with the SEC letters also said that Nomurahad received a letter.   The letters, dated July 30, were sent by fax to theJapanese firms, who were asked to respond by Aug. 12.   For some time, officials of Western securities firms havebeen concerned about possible links between organized crimeand the Japanese brokerage industry. Much of this worryfocuses on the reported involvement of Japanese gangsters inmanipulating Japanese share prices, &quot;greenmail&quot; and otheractivities.   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden declined to comment on theinvestigation. But, in a broad reference to both theorganized crime issue and the repayment of losses, he said,&quot;We would be very concerned and very hostile to the extentthat those practices crossed the Pacific and started croppingup here.&quot;   At a hearing in Washington last week, Mr. Breedenemphasized that he considered both angles of the Japanesescandal to be worthy of a hard look by U.S. regulators.   Executives familiar with the letters said that because oftheir alleged involvement with gangsters, Nomura and Nikkowere asked by the SEC for information relating to dealingsbetween the firms, its employees and Japanese regulatorsconcerning transactions in Tokyu stock.   The New York Stock Exchange and National Association ofSecurities Dealers, which operate the two biggest U.S. stockmarkets, recently sent letters to the Big Four firms askingthem to verify that their U.S. subsidiaries weren'tcompensating clients for losses.   At that time, all the firms except Nikko said that theyeither weren't or didn't believe they were extending suchcompensation. Nikko declined to comment.   Both the NASD, which operates the Nasdaq over-the-countermarket, and the Big Board have extensive rules that prohibitbrokerage houses from compensating clients for losses. Therules are designed to prevent member firms from guaranteeingthat customers won't lose money and to keep firms fromsharing accounts with clients.   By contrast, Japanese law doesn't specifically prohibitbrokerage firms from compensating clients for losses, butdoes bar firms from promising such payments in advance.   Meanwhile, in Japan, executives of Kokusai Securities Co.said that the Soka Gakkai religious group received 457million yen in compensation after complaining that Kokusaihad caused losses by mishandling the group's account.   The Buddhist group denied it had received &quot;compensationfor investment losses&quot; of the kind involved in the currentscandal. It called the payments, which Kokusai made by buyingwarrants from the group on favorable terms, &quot;properindemnity&quot; for damages caused when Kokusai &quot;placed ordersillegally without prior consent.&quot;   The disclosure is an embarrassment to the SokaGakkai-backed Komeito political party and could affect debateover the scandal in the Diet, or parliament. Komeito holdsthe swing vote in the Diet's upper house, where the rulingLiberal Democratic Party lacks a majority -- and where thefinance committee begins hearings on the scandal tomorrow.Sometimes known as the Clean Government Party, Komeito hasbeen a loud advocate of full disclosure in the scandal.   Many of the institutions reimbursed for losses by Japan'sbig brokerage houses have protested that they were unawarethey had received compensation. But statements by executivesof some of the second-tier securities firms seemed to castdoubt on those claims. For example, Tadashi Iwase, presidentof New Japan Securities Co., acknowledged thatrepresentatives from his firm had been in close contact withcompensated investors during the time the payments tookplace. Mr. Iwase said New Japan made the payments afterreceiving &quot;many severe claims&quot; from dissatisfied investors,who demanded that the brokerage firm make amends.   The other brokerage houses that released lists wereKankaku Securities Co., Sanyo Securities Co., Dai-IchiSecurities Co., Tokyo Securities Co., Okasan Securities Co.,Yamatane Securities Co., Taiheiyo Securities Co., MarusanSecurities Co., Mito Securities Co., Toyo Securities Co. andWako Securities Co.</TEXT></DOC>
