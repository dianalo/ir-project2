The surveyis divided into three parts. The first part deals with the section offlight characterized by the increase of body temperature at the heliocentricdistance 1 AU, i.e. at the frontier of the Earth's atmosphere, whichwas estimated to be approximately 280deg K, to the temperature at whichmeteoroid evaporation can start. This process is described as pre-ablationheating. The second part deals with effects connected with the visibletrajectory and with ionization trails and problems related to them. Thereexists a generic connection between the luminous flight and dark flightof meteoroids and the predictability of the impact area and the impactitself of fallen meteoroids. This is the subject of part three of thesurvey. (author). 49 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
