But it's there -- a huge urban forest.;    And badthings have entered that forest -- drought, disease and freezing temperatures.As a result, the trees, sometimes called the &quot;lungs of a city&quot; because oftheir oxygen-producing capabilities, are wheezing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  URBAN FOREST SUFFERING FROM POOR HEALTH  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;The general health is weakened. No question about it,&quot; said Bob Bryant,director of parks, forestry and maintenance for the town of Los Gatos. &quot;It'sthe worst I've experienced in 25 years.&quot;;    Already stressed by drought andthen punched with a chilly fist last December and January, a large number oftrees could be dead or dying. The extent of the damage won't be known untilspring.;    &quot;My recommendation is not to do a thing until April to see whatkind of budding and new growth we get and then we will know what trees toprune and save and what trees will have to be removed,&quot; Bryant said.;    Thetown already has applied for $130,000 from the state's Natural DisasterAssistance Act to fund the replanting of trees. That amount would be necessaryif all the town-owned trees that are damaged die, according to Bryant,representing what he terms a worst-case scenario.;    Officials in all theWest Valley communities say the problem with city-owned trees hasn't yetbecome a huge one, but they add that more trees than usual are having to beremoved and that their normal growth patterns are being affected.;    Treeremoval up; No more than six to 10 trees have to be removed in a normal yearin Campbell. This season the total is already more than 20.;    Tree removalsrepresent an extremely small proportion of the thousands of city-owned treeswhich line the streets and are in city parks, and the thousands more onprivate property. But the aesthetic and environmental qualities of trees makethem a priority concern of both city officials and homeowners. Brown lawns areone thing. Losing trees that took maybe 50 years to mature is another.;    Howmuch more serious the problem might become depends on how many trees end updead or unsalvageable, coupled with budgetary constraints and whatever waterallocations are available later this year.;    &quot;We'll have to move our waterresources around, but basically the way I'm viewing it is that ground- coverturf can be easily replaced, but a tree is a 20-, 30- or 50-year investment,&quot;said Mike DeGroot, Campbell public works superintendent.;    Non-potable waterused;  Last summer, the city stored non-potable (non-drinkable) water securedfrom the San Jose Water Treatment Plant and used a city water truck toirrigate critical areas.;    Most of the trees Campbell plants are Chinesepistachio, Raywood ash, Bradford pear, and flowering plum. The city thisseason already has lost quite a few young eucalyptus, some ficus, ash andevergreen pear trees, according to DeGroot.;    Monterey pines, which dot itshillsides, have proven to be the biggest problem in Saratoga. Thedrought-weakened trees are infested with bark beetles.;    &quot;Monterey pineshave been planted extensively on hillsides, primarily on private property, anda number of them have had to be removed,&quot; said Bob Rizzo, Saratoga parkssuperintendent. &quot;There are also a lot of eucalyptus and California peppertrees I've noticed looking real bad.&quot;;    It was reported last summer that thebark beetle infestation had become widespread in San Jose, affecting dozens oftrees in older parks and neighborhoods. Particularly hard hit were RainbowPark in West San Jose and Butcher Park in the Cambrian area.;    Could change; Rizzo said oaks and other drought-resistant trees are doing fairly well andthere isn't a large problem with city-owned trees in Saratoga. That couldchange if the drought continues.;    Riparian trees, those along lakes andcreekbeds, have been stressed as their root systems struggle in dry andcompacted soil.;    The white alders at Vasona Park in Los Gatos have beenhard hit, as have eucalyptus. &quot;I suspect the Australian willow has been badlyburned in the freeze,&quot; Bryant said.;    Removing and replanting trees is a bigexpense for municipalities. Likewise, homeowners could be faced with largebills dealing with the trees on their property.;    &quot;Those folks could be in aworld of hurt,&quot; said Bryant.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL CRONK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  722  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051118,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
