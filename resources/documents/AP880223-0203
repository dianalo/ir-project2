The two states received 45 points out of a possible 60 in thegroup's subjective assessments of programs in six areas: surfacewater protection, pesticide control, highway safety, land useplanning, indoor pollution and pollution from energy production anduse.   Not far behind in the rankings were California and New Jerseywith 44 points each and Connecticut with 43. At the bottom of thelist were Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas with 19 points, Arkansas andMississippi with 17 and Wyoming with 15.   In the separate areas, the group put these states first: NorthCarolina in surface water protection; California in pesticideprotection; Oregon in land use planning; New Jersey in combatingindoor pollution; Maryland in highway safety; and Massachusetts inenergy pollution control.   In an introduction to the report, Denis Hayes, chairman of thefund, said, ``Slowly, the environmental community has come torecognize that our responsibility is not discharged simply bypassing sweeping legislation. ... The real success must be won inthe trenches.   ``The purpose of this study is to share information on how thebattle is going in the trenches.''   This is the second report from the fund. Last year's examinedoutdoor air pollution, soil conservation, solid waste andrecycling, hazardous waste management, groundwater protection andrenewable energy and conservation. The fund said it plans to lookat each area every three years.   The rankings tried to account for the existence of statelegislation, the scope of programs, financing, monitoring andenforcement and indications of progress.   The report singled out Massachusetts, which imposed $697,000 inpenalties for water pollution under a new state program.   Among other points, the report said:   _Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohioand Washington ``have more than one-fifth of the major municipalpublic treatment works in significant non-compliance'' with theirwater pollution discharge permits.   _Most states rely on local government zoning ordinances forcontrols on land use, and statewide programs were found only inOregon, Florida, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey.   _Forty-two states have passed laws limiting smoking in publicplaces, and 22 states and more than 200 local governments restrictsmoking to some degree on the job.   _Though not one of the traditional environmental issues,``Highways are one of our most dangerous daily environments,'' and``The automobile is also the machine with the single greatestimpact on our environment,'' accounting for half of air pollution.</TEXT></DOC>
