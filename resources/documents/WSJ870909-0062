The suggested retail price is $295.    The reference works include &quot;World Almanac and Book of Facts,&quot; &quot;American Heritage Dictionary,&quot; &quot;Bartlett's Familiar Quotations&quot; and the U.S. ZIP code directory. The works are stored on a compact optical disk, similar to those used for highfidelity sound recordings.    Bookshelf is the Redmond, Wash., software maker's first general-purpose product using compact disks as a data-storage medium for personal computers. The disk is usable with an International Business Machines Corp. PC, AT or XT model, or a compatible system.    Users must also have a compact disk read-only memory drive, which cost about $750 and up. The drives, which are similiar to compact disk audio players, use a tiny laser to read data. </TEXT></DOC>
