No further detailswere available.   Rallies demanding the overthrow of the government and the releaseof a student charged with illegally visiting Communist North Koreawere held at 17 schools in Seoul and 10 in provincial cities, thestate KBS television said.   About 700 students in the capital fought riot police with clubs,rocks and firebombs, news reports said.   In the southeastern port of Pusan, about 1,000 students wieldingfirebombs and rocks clashed with police firing tear gas at DongaUniversity in a battle that lasted 90 minutes, Yonhap said.   ``Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' yelled 200 studentshurling firebombs on rain-slick streets outside Seoul's KyungheeUniversity. Riot police in combat fatigues fired tear gas to drivestudents back inside the campus.   ``Release Miss Im Su-kyong, flower of unification!'' studentsshouted.   Ms. Im was jailed for an illegal trip to North Korea to promotenational unification. She returned to the South in a much-publicizedborder crossing at the Demilitarized Zone Aug. 15. Students atSeoul's Polytechnic University and Sungkyunkwan University alsodemonstrated for her release today, battling riot police.   About 9,000 riot police surrounded Seoul campuses today to searchfor Im Chong-suk, chairman of the National Council of StudentRepresentatives, who has eluded police for two months.   Police issued an arrest warrant for Im in connection with thetrip to the North by Ms. Im. The two Ims are not related.   Ms. Im is in the custody of the national security agency, chargedwith violation of national security laws for making an unauthorizedtrip to a hostile nation. Police say all those involved with hertrip face punishment.   The Seoul government maintains that talks on unification of thedivided Korean peninsula must be carried out through officialchannels, not by private citizens.   Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority,claim the government is insincere in its efforts at dialogue withNorth Korea. Radicals also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S.troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact, sayingtheir presence hinders unification.   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and thecapitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945 and the twonations, which fought a war in 1950-53, remain bitter enemies.</TEXT></DOC>
