The intentof this formula is to preserve a reasonable measure of funding stabilitywhile promoting funding levels necessary to provide equivalent serviceto participants. With the administrative and program services funds tiedmore closely to participation, the Department expects that the formulawill more equitably allocate available funds to meet the administrativeand program services costs in State agencies and will remove disincentivesfor achieving economies in food costs that allow service to greater numbersof participants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> April 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Ronald J.

This rulewould not result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions. Nor would this rule have significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Pursuant to that review, the Administratorof the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this rule does nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subjectto approval by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The WIC Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic AssistancePrograms under No. 10.557 and is subject to the provisions of ExecutiveOrder 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State andlocal officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, and final rule related noticepublished June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29114). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Statutory Requirements The Department's authority to prescribe a WIC funds allocation formulais found in section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act (CNA) of 1966 (42 U.S.C.1786), as amended. Section 17(i) requires the Department to ``* * * divide,among the State agencies, the funds provided in accordance with this sectionon the basis of a formula determined by the Secretary.'' Legislative directivesfor the distribution of administrative and program services funds to Stateagencies are provided in section 17 (h)(1) and (h)(2). Section 17(h)(1)reads in part. ``The Secretary shall make 20 percent of the funds providedunder this section each fiscal year (other than funds expended for evaluationand pilot projects under subsection (g) of this section) available forState agency and local agency costs for nutrition services and administration.''This paragraph further stipulates that not less than one-sixth of the fundsState agencies expend for nutrition services and administration are tobe used for nutrition education activities, unless a State agency requestsauthorization to spend less than the required amount and provides documentationthat funding from other sources will be used for such activities. Section17(h)(2) further requires the Secretary to ``* * * allocate funds for nutritionservices and administration to each State agency on the basis of a formuladetermined by the Secretary, which shall include a minimum amount, andwhich shall be designed to take into account the varying needs of Stateagencies based on factors such as the number of local agencies and thenumber of persons participating in the program at those agencies.'' Insummary, the CNA directs the Department to allocate to State agencies 20percent of the total Federal funds available for the WIC Program (minusfunds expended for evaluation and pilot projects under subsection (g))for administrative and program services according to a formula that providesa minimum amount and that considers the varying needs of State agencies.Current Funding Formula On July 2, 1987, a final rule was published (52 FR 25182) that set forththe formulas for allocating both WIC food and administrative and programservices funds. While this rule made revisions to the formula for allocatingfood funds, the rule did not make any changes to the existing administrativeand program services funding formula. The current formula for allocatingadministrative and program services funds, in use since fiscal year 1984,provides funds in two ways. First, a guaranteed grant amount is calculatedwhich is the lesser of: (a) 21 percent of a State agency's food grant,or (b) the State agency's ratio of administrative and program servicesfunds to food funds allocated in the previous year, multiplied by the currentyear's food grant. Second, a discretionary fund is available for allocationby each Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regional office. The purpose ofthe discretionary fund is to provide for the varying needs of State agencies.The amount of discretionary funds available to each regional office forallocation to its respective State agencies is determined based on eachof its State agencies' ratio of administrative and program services fundsto food funds from the previous fiscal year. The difference between theproduct of the State agency's ratio and its current year's food grant andthe State's guaranteed administrative and program services grant representsthe State's contribution to the regional discretionary fund. The sum ofall States' contributions forms the regional discretionary fund.FNS regional offices determine the amount each State agency will receiveof the discretionary fund. The underlying premise of these discretionaryallocations by the regional offices is that their close working relationshipswith the State agencies afford them greater awareness of the State agencies'varying needs. Regional offices have allocated discretionary funds using factors suchas the State agency's ratio of administrative and program services fundsto food funds from the previous year, administrative and program servicescost per participant, service to high risk participants and funding forspecial projects. In fiscal year 1987, approximately 17 percent of totaladministrative and program services funds were awarded through the discretionarygrant component. Nationally, however, most State agencies received theamount of discretionary funds they ``contributed'' to the regional fund,and only 3 percent of the total discretionary funds were actually redistributedto other State agencies. Concerns About the Existing Formula Establishing each State agency's administrative and program services fundinglevel as a percentage of its food funding level has been a stable and straightforwardmethod of funding. The Department is concerned, however, that this methodmay entail some inequity in the distribution of funds under the formulaamong State agencies and regions of the country. There is a general recognition that the use of these ratios in calculatingthe grant amounts available for distribution to State agencies does notyield fully equitable results. Additionally, the Department is concerned that the current formula is adisincentive to a State agency's reduction of food costs per participant.Such lower food costs permit service to a greater number of participants.However, under the current formula, State agencies must provide administrationand program services for each additional participant with no increase inadministrative funding. andbullet; Alternative Formula Proposed A proposed rule containing an alternative funding formula was publishedfor comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 27005) on July 17, 1987. In the developmentof the proposed formula, the Department consulted with members of the WICcommunity, particularly the National Association of WIC Directors (NAWD).Discussions with the NAWD representatives centered on the formulation offunding principles, the consideration of factors affecting administrativeand program services costs, and the critique of specific formula optionsunder development. These discussions proved to be pivotal in the designof the proposed formula, whose fundamental difference from the currentformula was use of participation levels instead of ratios to food fundsas a basis for allocating administrative and program services funds. andbullet; Description of the Proposed Formula The objectives of the proposed formula were to give all State agenciesthe opportunity to provide equivalent service to participants and equivalentmanagement oversight and to remove existing disincentives to reducing foodcosts in order to serve more participants. To accomplish these objectiveswithin the context of ongoing program operations, the Department proposedto implement change in funding levels gradually. Thus, the proposed formulawould allocate funds to maintain previous funding levels while promotinga gradual movement toward a funding level that represents each State agency's``fair share'', or parity, funding level. The purpose of the parity grantcomponent was to reflect the funding levels State agencies would receiveif all available administrative and program services funds were allocatedprimarily on the basis of participation. The Department proposed two methodsfor determining parity grant levels, both of which recognized the higherper participant costs associated with smaller participation levels. Thefundamental difference between the two methods was that one (Option A)made no adjustment for differing salary costs among States, while the other(Option B) did. The implementation of the formula was designed to ensure gradual movementtoward the parity level. Each State agency would receive a stability fundinglevel equal to the total amount received in the previous fiscal year <T3>provided </T3>that participation levels did not decrease. If FNS projecteda decrease in participation for a State agency, that State agency wouldreceive its previous year funding level decreased by an amount commensuratewith the projected decrease in participation. The purpose of stabilityfunding is to maintain a measure of funding stability from year to year,and most funds available for administrative and program services wouldbe allocated through this component of the formula. Any funds remainingafter stability funding is satisfied would be allocated as residual fundson the basis of participation levels. State agencies could qualify forresidual funds in two ways: (1) Projected participation increases overthe levels of participation in the previous year, or (2) parity grant levelswhich exceeded stability funding levels. Although the goal of the proposed funding formula was eventually to fundall State agencies at their parity grant levels, a two-pronged approachto residual funding was proposed to provide further encouragement to Stateagencies to increase participation levels. Thus, State agencies which otherwisemight not qualify for residual funding under the parity grant componentof the formula would still qualify for some additional funding if theycould increase participation. The final step under the proposed funding formula was to provide for discretionaryfunding by FNS regional offices. The Department proposed to retain thediscretionary funding concept, which is part of the current formula, inorder to allow some flexibility in the funding process for meeting thevarying needs of State agencies. The Department proposed to accomplishthis by subtracting 10 percent of each State agency's total grant (stabilitygrant plus any residual funds for which the State agency qualified) andaggregating those amounts for all State agencies within each FNS region.The FNS regional office would then distribute the funds based on the needsof State agencies within the region. andbullet; Comments Received on the Proposed Formula A total of 234 letters were received which provided comments on the proposedformula. The commentors represented 48 State agencies, 155 local agencies,and 31 interested groups. The Department considered the comments receivedin formulating this final rule. Following is a discussion of the majorissues raised by commentors in response to the proposed rule for allocatingWIC administrative and program services funding. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues: Formula Concepts and Concerns</ITAG>andbullet; Support for the Proposal A total of 228 commentors provided comments supporting or opposing theproposal to revise the formula used to allocate funds for administrativeand program services. Basic approval or disapproval could not be determinedfor six comment letters received. Of the 228 comment letters, 74 percentgenerally supported the proposal. Their support was conditional on oneor more recommended modifications; 103 commentors limited their commentsto support for the adoption of either Option A or Option B as the preferredmethod for determining parity grants. Sixty commentors (26 percent) opposedthe proposed rule in its entirety. The common elements of the objectionsraised by these commentors include the need for additional research intothe costs of administering the WIC Program, the complexity of the proposaland the perception that certain State agencies or regions of the countrywould be disadvantaged by the adoption of the proposed formula. andbullet; Participation_Based FundingA smaller number of commentors (43) specifically addressed the conceptof participation-based funding. Of this number, 71 percent supported theconcept, and 29 percent opposed. Those who opposed the use of participationas a basis for allocating administrative and program services funds citedproblems which they believe are inherent in this funding approach, suchas the lack of predictability in funding levels from year to year and reducedper participant funding without significant increases in funds appropriatedby Congress (since participation-based funding would be expected to promoteincreases in participation). While such outcomes could result from fundingbased solely on participation, most of the funds will, in fact, be allocatedon the basis of prior year funding levels. However, the ultimate objectiveof the new funding formula is to provide funds primarily on the basis ofthe number of participants served. The Department continues to believethat this is a fair method of allocating funds. A related issue raised by 26 commentors was the concern that participation-basedfunding may encourage some State agencies to serve more eligible personsby reducing the quantity and quality of food packages. With regard to foodcost economies, it is the Department's intent that State agencies willreview current policies and practices on food package design, food deliverysystems, and vendor selection and monitoring practices to determine potentialcost-saving measures. However, State agencies should not contemplate measuresdetrimental to the nutritional integrity of food packages. Any changesto food packages will be reviewed carefully by FNS in accordance with guidelinesoutlined in FNS Instruction 804-1, <T3>WIC Program_Food Package Design: Administrative Adjustments and NutritionTailoring. </T3>If FNS determines that a State agency has improperly reducedthe nutritional content of food packages such State agency will risk theimposition of funding sanctions, as described in Section 246.19(a)(2) ofthe WIC Program Regulations.andbullet; Gradual Change A basic featue of the proposed formula was the gradual change from fundinglevels determined by the current formula to funding levels which are primarilybased on participation. Most commentors who addressed this feature of theproposal supported the need for gradual change, and some commentors recommendedconsideration of placing a cap on the amount of change allowed for fundinglevels from one year to the next. Other commentors were opposed to limitingthe amount of change in funding levels because this would impede the movementtoward parity funding. While recognizing the concern expressed on behalfof State agencies which will receive a lesser share of funding under thenew formula, the Department believes that the new formula fairly balancesthe need for funding stability with the need to promote funding which emphasizesequivalent service to participants throughout the country. The first priorityunder the new formula will be to allocate funds on the basis of State agencies'previous year grant levels; it is only after stability funding is fullysatisfied that any remaining funds will be allocated on the basis of participation.Given the fact that most funds available for allocation for administrativeand program services will be allocated through the formula's stabilitycomponent, the Department does not believe that further restrictions onchanges to funding levels are warranted.andbullet; Interaction with the Food Funding Formula Thirty-nine commentors, representing a broad spectrum of State agenciesand interested groups, expressed concern that the objectives of the proposedformula conflict with those of the formula by which food funds are allocatedto State agencies. A new food funding formula which was published as afinal rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 25182) on July 2, 1987, provides fundingincentives to State agencies based on their service to participants whoare at the greatest risk due to nutritional deficiences or medical conditions.The objective of this funding policy is to encourage State agencies totarget benefits to eligible persons who are at the greatest nutritionalrisk and who therefore have a greater need for program benefits. However,the proposed administrative and program services funding formula wouldprovide funding incentives to State agencies to increase participationwithout regard to the nutritional risk status of the additional participants.Since the number of participants that a State agency can serve is directlyrelated to the cost of the food packages provided to participants, lowerfood expenditures result in the ability to serve more people. However,commentors pointed out that high risk participants, particularly infants,tend to require more expensive food packages, and thus State agencies whichserve a greater percentage of high risk participants are likely to havehigher per participant food expenditures. Commentors contended that a Stateagency could be rewarded under the food formula for targeting benefitsto high risk participants and penalized under the proposed administrativeand program services funding formula for having higher per participantfood expenditures.The Department agrees that the two formulas differ with regard to fundingobjectives. In an effort to determine whether these differences could producethe conflict predicted by commentors, the Department conducted computersimulations of the two formulas with results projected into fiscal year1989. Based on these simulations, it appears that well-targeted State agencieswould receive slightly less in funding compared to State agencies whichare less well-targeted. Although the reduction of administrative and programservices funding for well-targeted State agencies was slight (less than1 percent reduction of the administrative grant per participant), the Departmentbelieves that it is prudent to provide a targeting incentive in the administrativeand program services funding formula. Therefore, a specific targeting factorhas been incorporated into the final formula which will reward State agenciesfor service to high risk participants. In doing so, the Department reaffirmsthe important program goal of targeting WIC benefits to those in greatestneed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Stability Funding </ITAG>Forty-two commentors addressed issues related to the stability componentof the proposed funding formula. Six commenters supported the proposalas stated or with some modifications; 36 commentors opposed the provision.Those who opposed objected to the proposed methodology of reducing a Stateagency's previous year funding level by an amount commensurate with projectedparticipation decreases. Commentors stated that stability funding shouldat least equal the amount of funds received in the previous year. A majorityof the opposing commentors also recommended that an adjustment for inflationshould be added to the previous year grant levels when computing stabilitygrants under the new formula. The Department concurs with the recommendation that stability funding shouldequal the previous year's total administrative and program services fundinglevel with no reductions for projected participating decreases. The Stateagency's stability funding level is based on a known, objective value_thepreceeding year administrative and program services funding level_althoughthe exact amount of that level may not be final until well into the succeedingfiscal years. Preclusion of an adjustment for projected decreases in participationwill improve predictability of funding levels for the State agencies. Anappropriate change has been incorporated into the final rule. However,the Department decided not to include an inflation adjustment for determiningstability grants. The Department's reasoning on this matter is that theintroduction of an inflation factor into the formula would severely limitthe amount of funds available for residual funding, thus hampering themovement toward parity funding. <ITAG tagnum="84">Residual Funding </ITAG>andbullet; kProjected Participation Due to the revised method of determining stability funding as discussedin the preceding paragraph, use of projected participation in the finalrule is limited to calculating the amount of residual funding for whicha State agency qualifies. The Department proposed to project participationby dividing each State agency's current fiscal year food grant by its foodexpenditures per participant (FEP) averaged over the most recent closed-out12 months. That quotient would be divided by 12 to arrive at a monthlyparticipation level. The FEP is derived from participation and food expendituresreported by State agencies to FNS on the Form FNS-498, WIC Monthly Financialand Program Status Report. To account for increased costs in the currentfiscal year, the FEP would be increased by the same base anticipated rateof inflation that would be applied in determining current year food grants.A total of 38 commentors addressed issues related to projected participation.Half of these commentors generally supported the concept of projectingparticipation, although most suggested modifications to the proposed methodology.The other half opposed the use of projections, and many recommended, instead,the use of average monthly participation levels from the previous year.State agencies which have initiated or plan to initiate infant formularebate programs or other competitive bidding systems designed to reducefood costs were particularly concerned about this issue. Commentors generally felt that the proposed methodology would result ininaccurate projections. Specific recommendations to improve the accuracyof the projections included using more recent data to calculate each Stateagency's FEP and adjusting the FEP for prospective food cost savings andfor the additional cost of serving high risk participants. While acknowledging certain limitations to the proposed method of projectingparticipation, the Department believes that it represents a fair and reasonableapproach to forecasting participation. With the exception of the computationsused to determine an inflation adjustment for FEP, the Department intendsto project participation as proposed. The Department's reasons for retainingthe proposed methodology for projecting participation are summarized below.andbullet; The projections are based on the most objective information available_final(closed-out) food expenditure and participation data, as reported by Stateagencies, and current year food grant levels. Use of data that is not closed-outcould result in preliminary FEP's that may be inaccurate. andbullet; The use of a 12 month average of final (closed-out) food expendituresand participation captures the full picture of State agency activity regardingparticipation and food expenditures. Use of a shorter time period to averagefood expenditures and participation could result in an average FEP thatreflects temporary or seasonal fluctuations in food prices or participationlevels. andbullet; Prospective consideration of food cost savings or other actionthat might increase participation (e.g., elimination of sales tax on WICfood purchases) would introduce an unacceptable level of unreliabilityinto participation projections. The projection methodology adopted in thisrule will recognize participation increases due to cost savings actuallyachieved. While there will be a brief time lag between actual participationincrease and the subsequent influx of administrative funding to managethese increases, the Department believes this is a more prudent and objectivemanner in which to allocate administrative resources. andbullet; A specific targeting factor has been incorporated into the paritygrant component of the formula. Addition of a specific targeting factormore clearly reinforces the program goal of targeting benefits to highrisk participants. One change that will be made concerns the calculations of the inflationfactor to be applied to each State agency's average FEP. As several commentorscorrectly pointed out, the rate of inflation used should match the periodof time used to calculate the FEP through the current fiscal year. Therefore,an inflation factor will be applied to the FEP which will accomplish thatobjective. andbullet; Residual Funding Based on Projected Participation Increases As proposed, State agencies may qualify for residual funds based on participationincreases projected by FNS. The amount of residual funds would be determinedby applying a multiplier to the projected increase in participation fromthe previous year. The multiplier would equal an administrative expenditureper participant (AEP) averaged from the lowest quartile of AEP's from theprevious fiscal year.Eighteen commentors addressed this aspect of the proposed funding formula.Four commentors opposed the allocation of residual funds based on projectedparticipation increases. These commentors stated that all residual fundsshould be allocated only on the basis of the parity grant component. Anotherissue that concerned several commentors was the proposed method of comparingprojections from year to year as a basis for determining changes in participationlevels. Commentors felt that without some comparison to actual averageannual participation levels beyond the first year, the projections wouldlose any similarity to actual participation levels. A third issue addressedwas the proposed use of an average AEP drawn from the lowest quartile ofAEP's. In general, commentors felt that it was not equitable to use thesame multiplier for all State agencies because their costs in serving eachadditional participant vary. The position taken was that the smallest Stateagencies, in particular, would not be adequately compensated for theircomparatively higher expenditures on a per participant basis. The Department has retained this provision of the new funding formula asproposed. The Department believes that it is appropriate to recognize effortsundertaken by higher cost State agencies to reduce food costs and increaseparticipation. Many such State agencies would not otherwise receive residualfunds through the parity component of the formula. Regarding the concernabout comparing projections from year to year, this method will ensurethat any changes in participation or food expenditures per participantnot accounted for in the previous year's projections will be consideredin the current year's projections. Also, it should be noted that projectedparticipation decreases from one year to the next year will not affectfunding levels as this procedure was deleted due to the revised methodof determining stability grants. Regarding the concern that the use of one standard AEP multiplier willnot adequately compensate all State agencies for the cost of serving additionalparticipants, the Department is reluctant to make additional adjustments.To do so would reduce the amount of residual funds available to State agenciesbased on the parity grant component of the new formula. This would considerablyslow the movement toward fair share funding based on participation, whichis the ultimate objective of the new formula. andbullet; <T3>Residual Funding Based on Parity Grant Determinations </T3>As proposed, the purpose of the parity grant component of the new fundingformula is to reflect ``fair share'' funding levels for State agenciesbased primarily on participation. Parity grant calculations provide anothermeans by which State agencies may qualify for residual funding; the differencebetween the stability funding level and the parity funding level equalsthe amount of residual funds for which a State agency qualifies. The Departmentoffered two approaches to determining parity funding levels, Option A andOption B. Option A would provide funds on the basis of a per participantrate. Option B would provide funds on the basis of a constructed salarybudget which computes the number of State and local staff according tostaff to participant ratios and salaries paid within the State; the balanceof funds would be paid out on a flat administrative grant per person. Bothoptions would recognize the higher costs associated with smaller participationlevels on a per participant basis. A total of 191 commentors addressed the proposed options of determiningparity grants. Of this number, 119 (62 percent) supported Option A, 35(18 percent) supported Option B, and 37 (19 percent) opposed both options.The majority of commentors supporting Option A were from one region ofthe country; over two-thirds of the commentors represented one State fromthat region. Similarly, most supporters of Option B were from a singleregion, and those opposing both options most frequently represented 2 otherregions of the country. The regional split in preferences for the proposedoptions, as well as for the new formula itself, is understandable due tothe shift in funds allocations on a regional basis. The inclusion of salarycosts was the most divisive issue. State agencies with higher than averagesalary costs tended to support Option B, while State agencies with lowerthan average salary costs supported Option A. The Department has selected a modified Option A as the method used to determineparity grant levels. A number of factors and issues were considered inreaching this decision. The Department considered the relative merits ofthe methodologies used in both options, exclusive of the controversy surroundingthe use of salary costs as a factor in the formula. Compared to OptionA, the methodology used in Option B had several drawbacks. First, the formulawas more complex. A second and perhaps more important consideration wasthe concern raised by commentors regarding assumptions used to determinestaffing levels at the local level. Ultimately, the Department concludedthat Option A provided a more objective means of allocating funds basedon participation. However, the commentors supporting Option B had valid reasons for recommendingthe consideration of salary costs in determining parity grant levels. Inaddition, some commentors pointed out the need to consider the additionalcosts of serving high risk participants. Taking all of these argumentsinto consideration, the Department has revised the proposed Option A methodof determining parity grant levels to include factors which recognize differentialsalary costs among State agencies and the relative success in targetingbenefits to high risk participants. Parity grant levels will be computed in 2 parts: first, 80 percent of availableadministrative and program services funds will be allocated on the basisof administrative grant per participant (AGP) rates adjusted for caseloadsize as proposed in Option A; and second, the remaining 20 percent of availablefunds will be allocated on the basis of salary and targeting factors. Thesalary and targeting factors will be determined as follows: (1) Each State agency's average annual salary level will be indexed tothe national average salary; (2) Each State agency's share of imputed priority I participants comparedto its total average monthly participation level will be indexed to thenational average share of imputed priority I participants; (3) Each State agency's salary index and targeting index will be addedtogether and multiplied against its projected participation level; and(4) Each State agency's share of the national total determined in step3 will be determined and then multiplied by 20 percent of the total amountof funds available for administrative and program services.Following is an example showing the calculations used to determine theamount of funds a State agency would receive based on the salary and targetingfactors.Step 1:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s8,34,2,27,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>State A average salary ($25,000)</H1><H2>National average salary ($20,000)</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>State A salary index (1.25)</H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>Step 2:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s8,49,2,30,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>State A ratio of priority I participation (.50)</H1><H2>National ratio of priority I participation (.40)</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>State A targeting index (1.25)</H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>Step 3:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/9,g1,t1,s8,30,2,20,2,24,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>(State A salary index (1.25) State A targeting index (1.25)</H1><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>State A projected participation (22,000)</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>State A salary and targeting factor (55,000)</H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="21">Repeat this step for all State agencies to arrive at a National total(7,000,000)</ITAG></ITAG>Step 4:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/9,g1,t1,s8,26,2,53,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>State A (55,000)</H1><H2>National total (7,000,000)</H2><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>20 percent of total administrative funds (74,000,000)</H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="21">State A funds for Salary and Targeting=$581,428</ITAG></ITAG>Each State agency's parity grant level will equal the funds generated bythese computations plus the funds generated using the size-adjusted AGPrates. Further discussions of comments received on these cost factors follow:andbullet; <T3>Use of Size-Adjusted Factors in Parity Component</T3>Although the Department lacked complete information on the effect of theeconomy of scale phenomenon on WIC administrative and program servicescosts, a methodology was proposed to account for the higher participationcosts associated with small participation levels. The use of size-adjustedfactors in the parity grant component was proposed in order to avert severereduction in funding levels for State agencies with average monthly participationlevels under 15,000.Thirty-one commentors addressed the economy of scale issue and the proposeduse of size-adjusted factors in the new funding formula. There was unanimoussupport among these commentors for recognizing the special funding needsof State agencies with average monthly participation levels below 5,000;there was less agreement about the proposed method used to compensate thehigher per participant costs of these State agencies or that State agencieswith participation levels over 5,000 require special consideration. Althougha majority of commentors (58 percent) agreed with the proposed methodologyof using size-adjusted factors based on reported administrative expendituresper participant (AEP), most commentors suggested modifications to the approach.Commentors most frequently suggested that the first size band containingState agencies with participation levels up to 5,000 should be broken intosmaller size bands containing either the first 500 or 1,000 participants.Other commentors opposed the use of size-adjusted factors as a means ofcompensating State agencies with small participation levels; some recommendedthat State agencies with fewer than 5,000 participants should be fundedoutside the formula through the use of minimum grants. Other commentorscriticized the data used or the methods by which the size-adjusted factorswere determined. Several commentors pointed out that the relative sizeand number of local agencies affect a State agency's AEP as significantlyas the overall participation level.In response to suggestions to adjust the first size band downward, theDepartment explored several possible adjustments using the same databaseused to determine the proposed size-adjusted factors (FY 1986 final AEP's).However, none of the proposed revisions provided the intended effect ofappropriately increasing compensation for the smallest State agencies withoutinappropriately reducing compensation for the larger State agencies. Finally,the Department concluded that it is not in the best interest of the Programto reduce the parity funding levels for the larger State agencies whichserve the majority of WIC participants. The relatively small amounts ofadditional compensation sought by the smallest State agencies to meet unfundedlegitimate costs of operations can be attained more easily through negotiationswith FNS regional offices for discretionary funds. This would not be thecase for larger State agencies whose additional funding needs resultingfrom reducing parity grant levels could exceed the amount of availablediscretionary funds. The Department considered the comments concerningthe relative size and number of local agencies but concluded that it wouldnot be appropriate to include this factor in the formula, since it is underthe control of the State agencies. Further, inclusion of the numbers oflocal agencies in the formula would be a disincentive for State agenciesto economize administration by consolidating services.For these reasons, the proposed size-adjusted factors have been retainedin the final funding formula as proposed. The Department believes thatthe use of size-adjusted factors in the new funding formula adequatelyaccommodates the needs of smaller State agencies which have higher thanaverage administrative expenditures on a per participant basis. On a periodicbasis, the Department will review the actual costs differences betweenthe size bands to determine whether the size-adjusted factors need to berevised.andbullet; <T3>Adjustments to Parity Component for Salary Costs</T3> The Department considered the issue of salary costs separately from thechoice of options used to determine parity grant levels. In proposing OptionB as one approach to account for salary costs, the Department specificallyrequested comments on the appropriateness of including salary costs inthe funding formula and suggestions of a methodology. Ninety-two commentswere received on the issue of including salary costs in the funding formula.Of this number, 24 commentors (26 percent) favored the inclusion of salarycosts in the formula, 7 commentors (8 percent) opposed the inclusion ofsalaries for theoretical reasons, and 61 (67 percent) commentors opposedthe inclusion of salaries for practical reasons, citing concerns aboutthe proposed salary database. Those who favored the consideration of salarycosts in the funding formula stated that salary costs significantly affectadministrative and program services costs in the WIC Program and are notunder the control of State agencies. Other commentors opposed the use ofa salary factor in the formula on the grounds that this would representan unwarranted departure from FNS funding policies for food and nutritionprograms. These commentors also believed that it is unfair to certain regionsin the country to include salary costs without also including other factorsaffecting administrative and program services costs, such as rurality andgeographical factors. Finally, those commentors who opposed the inclusionof salary costs on practical grounds faulted the database that the Departmentproposed to use in determining average salary levels for WIC staff. Asdescribed in the preamble to the proposed rule, the database for the 50States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands wouldbe supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statics (BLS). The BLS data representsthe most recent average annual salaries for State and local governmentworkers as reported by each States's employment security agency. Commentorsfelt that the BLS averages are not appropriate for WIC staff who tend toreceive higher than average salaries. They also objected to the age ofthe database which reflected salaries paid two years ago. The Department recognizes that this issue represents one of the most controversialaspects of the proposed rule. The Department believes that strong sentimentsexpressed by commentors on the issue tend to reflect concern about theappropriateness of shifting funds among State agencies due to inclusionof salary costs in the formula. Notwithstanding these concerns, the Departmentcontinues to believe that salary costs represent the most significant factorin WIC administrative and program services costs. Based on the budgetedexpenditures submitted by State agencies for Fiscal Year 1987, a nationalaverage of 72 percent of all administrative and program services fundswere budgeted for salaries and fringe benefits. Furthermore, a State agencywhich must pay higher than average salaries is unlikely to be able to hireas many staff as a State agency with lower salaries. Thus, State agencieswhich must pay the higher salary levels due to prevailing economic conditionswithin the State may be understaffed, and WIC participants may receivereduced quality of service. Regarding concerns expressed about the proposed database for salary costs,the Dapartment notes that a disproportionate number of commentors who raisedthese concerns were from one region of the country and almost all of thesecommentors represent one State in that region. While recognizing the concernsraised by these commentors, the Department continues to believe that theBLS data represents a reliable national database. As described in the preambleto the proposed rule, the BLS database represents a virtual census of privateand public employment and wage data in the United States. Given the influence of salary costs on WIC administrative and program servicesand the access to a reliable national database, the Department concludesthat it would be incongruous to exclude from the formula a factor whichrecognizes the differential salary costs of State agencies. Therefore,the formula contained in this final rule includes a factor which recognizesthe different salary costs among State agencies. The most recent data availablefrom BLS will be used for the 50 States, the District of Columbia, PuertoRico and the Virgin Islands. The proposed use of a salary level for IndianState agencies which equals the salary of a grade 9, step 1 in the Federalgovernment's general schedule pay scale will be retained. The salary levelused for Guam will equal the BLS salary level used for Hawaii. For mostyears, these salary levels will reflect average salaries paid two yearsprior to the applicable fiscal year for which funds are allocated. andbullet; <T3>Rurality and Geographic Considerations as Cost Factors</T3> A total of 24 commentors addressed issues related to rurality and geographicalconsiderations as affecting administrative and program services costs.Almost all of these commentors stated the new funding formula should includeboth factors because of the significiant impact on the costs of servingWIC participants. Commentors did not, however, suggest any national databaseto be explored in determining an objective and verifiable method of accountingfor costs associated with these factors. Because the Department was unableto allocate objectives and verifiable data on these factors which couldbe meaningfully applied to WIC costs, these factors were not included inthe final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discretionary Funding </ITAG>Sixty-four commentors addressed the discretionary funding provision ofthe proposed funding formula. Although almost all of these commentors supportedthe continuation of discretionary funding by FNS regional offices, a majorityof the commentors criticized the proposed methodology for determining eachState agency's contributions to its respective regional discretionary ``pot.''A substantial number of commentors who opposed the proposed methodologyexpressed concern that a 10 percent contribution of each State agency'stotal grant level to the regional discretionary fund could result in afinal guaranteed grant level for some State agencies equalling only 90percent of the previous year's grant level. Other commentors representinglarge State agencies stated that discretionary funding perpetuates fundinginequities and penalizes large State agencies whose contributions to thediscretionary pots are used to provide additional funding to smaller Stateagencies. The most frequent suggestion for improving this provision ofthe proposed funding formula was to provide guidelines for discretionaryallocations by regional offices. While most commentors suggested the establishmentof broad guidelines, some commentors recommended the use of specific factorsin the guidelines. Examples of suggested factors included funding for movementtoward parity grant levels, service to high risk participants, ruralityand geographic considerations, and breast-feeding initiatives. Many commentorsalso suggested that the amount of funds made avaliable for discretionaryfunding should be reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent or less of Stateagencies' total funding levels. The Department has adopted the suggestion to provide guidelines to regionaloffices in the allocation of discretionary funds. Guidelines will be establishedprior to each fiscal year's funding allocation. The establishment of annualguidelines through normal policy communication channels with the regionaloffices rather than through the regulations is intended to permit a greaterresponsiveness to national program goals which may change over time.The Department considered reducing the amount of funds available for discretionaryfunding in response to comments received. However, the Department has retainedthe proposed provision to allocate 10 percent of the total amount of administrativeand program services funds available for allocation. This provision alreadyrepresents a reduction in discretionary funding amounts used under thecurrent funding formula. In fiscal year 1987, 17 percent of the total administrativeand program services funds were allocated to State agencies as discretionaryfunding.Summary of Revisions Made in the Final RuleA summary of revisions made to the proposed rule which have been incorporatedinto the final rule is provided below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,p6,6/7,i1,s25,r25,r25</C><T4>Provision of New WIC Administrative and Program Services Funding Formula_</T4><H1>Provision</H1><H1>Proposed rule</H1><H1>Final rule</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Stability Funding<D>Previous year grant level adjusted for projected participation decreases</D><D>Previous year grant level.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Parity Grant Component<D>Option A basd on a grant per person, or Option B based on a constructedsalary budget</D><D>Option A modified to include salary and targeting factors.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Discretionary funding<D>Ten percent of final grant level subtracted and allocated by FNS regionaloffices based on State agency needs</D><D>Same ten percent level used.
