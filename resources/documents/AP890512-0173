Gen. George L. Monahan Jr.,who took command of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organizationon Feb. 1.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the former head of SDIO, Lt.Gen. James Abrahamson, have placed great hope in Brilliant Pebbles,a system of 3,000 to 5,000 space-based interceptors. Each would beabout four feet long, weighing less than 100 pounds, and would havethe capability to spot, track and destroy enemy intercontinentalballistic missiles.   Earlier concepts for other systems called for deployment ofseveral hundred satellites, each equipped with about 10 Space-BasedInterceptors (SBI) to destroy enemy rockets, with an estimateddeployment cost of $69.1 billion.   Abrahamson said in an unusual ``end of tour'' memorandum thatBrilliant Pebbles could be deployed for $25 billion, including aseparate system of surveillance satellites.   Monahan, however, in his first meeting with reporters, declinedto project a deployment price for Brilliant Pebbles, and said hisorganization had not sharply increased money devoted to the project.   Current Pentagon spending on Brilliant Pebbles research isrunning at an annual rate of $46 million, said Monahan, up from the1988 level of $40 million, but the funding level is likely tochange based on the outcome of a review this summer.   President Bush has lowered the proposed Star Wars budget from$5.9 billion to $4.6 billion for the current year, a level thatMonahan says will delay development of the entire system for abouttwo years.   At the current pace of research, Monahan said, the Pentagonshould have enough information to allow the president and Congressto decide by 1993 or 1994 whether to deploy a ballistic missiledefense system.   Brilliant Pebbles and other space-based systems will be reviewedthis summer by the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon group, and theJasons, a team of university scientists, said Monahan.   One possible outcome of that review might be a decision tocombine elements from Brilliant Pebbles and other systems, forexample placing two, three or four interceptors aboard eachsatellite, he said.   Brilliant Pebbles, developed at the government's LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory in California, solves a number ofproblems that had vexed Star Wars researchers, he said, but thesheer number of envisioned ``Pebbles'' created new communicationsand production challenges.   ``From what we see today, things look doable. But we are not yetready to jump out ahead on it,'' said Monahan.   A key problem that scientists must solve for Brilliant Pebbles,said Monahan, was communicating to the satellites the command toopen fire on enemy boosters within the first two minutes of theirflight.   ``You have to pull the trigger real fast,'' he said. Thedecision must be made by human beings and not by computers, he said.   Abrahamson and the chief scientist in the Brilliant Pebblesprogram, Lowell Wood, have called Brilliant Pebbles a majorbreakthrough because the system would be made on a production line,vastly reducing the cost.   But Monahan declined to speculate on the cost.   ``Nobody has yet mass-produced spacecraft before,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
