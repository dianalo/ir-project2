In meetings in both nations, traditional enemies whose relationswith the United State also have been strained, Baker was seekingsupport for the Bush administration as it forms a strategy fornegotiations with the Soviet Union.   Greece and Turkey are the seventh and eighth countries on hisitinerary, now in its fifth day. Baker is due to return late Friday.   The most critical talks wound up Monday night in Bonn with acommitment from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the principle of keepingNATO nuclear forces up to date.   But the West German leader, facing national elections next yearin a country where disarmament sympathies are strong, would notwithdraw his proposal for a delay of two or three years in extendingthe range of U.S-built Lance missiles, which now can fire 70 miles.   Kohl has revived a West German campaign to have NATO assign highpriority to negotiating reductions in shorter-range rockets with theWarsaw Pact.   Former Secretary of State George Shultz persuaded NATO foreignministers two years ago to give the issue low priority in light of aU.S.-Soviet agreement to scrap intermediate-range missiles.   ``Let's see what happens at the next NATO summit,'' Baker said inacknowledging that he had not settled the issue in talks with Kohland West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.   While in Europe, Baker is making preliminary arrangements for aNATO summit meeting in Brussels in May.   In Turkey, which has the alliance's second-largest standing army,after the United States, modernization ranks high on the agenda.Turkey wants a billion dollars from the United States to refurbishtroops and jet fighters.   Accusations of human rights violations, made in a StateDepartment report last week, also are an irritant in relations withAnkara.   Baker scheduled a 2{ hour visit with Premier Turgut Ozal andForeign Minister Mesut Yilmaz before flying to Athens. There he isto meet President Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister KarolosPapoulias.   A 1983 agreement to maintain military bases in Greece expired inDecember and Papandreou has vowed to force a U.S. withdrawal.   Negotiations continue, and a compromise may be worked out tolimit the pullout to single installation in Athens area. The UnitedStates now operates four large and 20 small bases in Greece.   Greek officials' decision in December to free a suspectedPalestinian terrorist, Osama Abdel Zomar, put a crimp in relationswith the United States.   Zomar, who is alleged to belong to the Abu Nidal terrorist group,is wanted for questioning about a 1982 grenade attack on Rome's mainsynagogue. Greece expelled him to Libya.   Greece has not disclosed whether it will allow another suspectedterrorist, Mahammed Rashid, to be extradited to the United Statesfor prosecution in the bombing of a 1982 Pan Am jetliner. Apassenger died in that attack.</TEXT></DOC>
