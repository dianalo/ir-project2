Last year, Investor Responsibility Research Center found that a majority of the 72 institutional investors it surveyed favor secret ballots.    The secret ballot is one of a slew of issues shareholders have submitted for inclusion in proxy statements for this year's annual meetings. The American Society of Corporate Secretaries expects about the same number of proposals this year as last year, when 291 corporations received 550 proposals.    Last year, shareholder proposals were split about evenly between social and corporate issues. &quot;This year, corporate governance outweighs social responsibility,&quot; says Diana Wienckoski, who tracks shareholder initiatives for the secretaries' society. Corporate-governance issues this year include the secret ballot, opposition to anti-takeover measures, prohibitions against paying &quot;greenmail&quot; (buying off corporate raiders), limitations on executive compensation and stock options, and increasing shareholders' ability to include proposals on proxy statements and nominate their own slate of directors.    Initiatives on South Africa continue to dominate social-issue proposals. Although companies have been seeing such resolutions since 1971, the persistence of their sponsors has made them effective, says Timothy H. Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. &quot;Numerous chief executive officers have said that by coming back year after year, church groups showed they were serious, and as a result these South Africa resolutions precipitated a change of corporate policy,&quot; he says.    In the past three years, more than 100 companies have withdrawn or cut back their involvement in South Africa, and virtually every U.S. bank has stopped lending there, Mr. Smith says.    Yet, proposals on South Africa are almost as numerous this year as in the past, accounting for about half the social-issue initiatives. That's because some major companies continue operating in the country, including the oil giants, Mobil, Texaco and Chevron. Also, some businesses that divested South African operations continue to sell products there or retain ties through licensing and franchise agreements. As a result, many of the South Africa proposals are more specific than earlier ones, which merely urged that a company should get out of the country.    Other social-issue resolutions this year address religious discrimination in Northern Ireland, production of nuclear weapons, lending to Chile's repressive regime, Third-World debt, overseas marketing practices of infant formula and cigarette makers, a host of environmental matters, and minority-employment and purchasing practices.    Shareholder proposals generally aren't popular with corporate executives. Management tends to consider the proxy statement its instrument for soliciting shareholder support, says Philip O'Connell, chairman-elect of the American Society of Corporate Secretaries and secretary of Champion International Inc.    Especially irksome to management are the small shareholders who repeatedly submit the same proposal. &quot;Doing it year in and year out ends up making democracy a nuisance,&quot; says Richard W. Duesenberg, senior vice president of Monsanto Corp. and chairman of the corporate secretaries society.    Equally annoying for shareholders is a company's refusal to include a proposal on its proxy statement. With Securities and Exchange Commission approval, companies can exclude a proposal on either technical or substantive grounds. Proposals from institutional investors, however, sometimes are treated more cordially than ones from individual activists.    Steven Matthews, assistant comptroller of New York City who oversees its $32 billion employees' retirement fund, agrees, adding that adversarial treatment of a shareholder proposal tends to generate negative publicity for the corporation and in turn stiffens the resolve of the institution to continue to assert the proposal. &quot;Most companies would rather reach an amicable agreement with us,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
