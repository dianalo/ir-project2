Mr. Trump previously said he might raise his stake in Bally to more than 25%. But he has been battling with the company in court, and earlier this week agreed that he wouldn't buy more Bally shares until a preliminary court hearing Feb. 4.    Bally agreed, as previously reported, that it wouldn't proceed with its proposed acquisition of Golden Nugget Inc.'s casino-hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., until the hearing is held.    Bally agreed last week to buy the casino-hotel and some land nearby for $140 million in cash and stock and the assumption of a $299 million mortgage.    If Bally completes its proposed acquisition, it would own two Atlantic City casinos; it also owns Bally's Park Place.    Mr. Trump asked the Justice Department Nov. 26 for permission under antitrust law to boost his Bally stake. Such permission is necessary before he can buy more Bally stock or exercise options he currently holds.    Last month, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division asked Mr. Trump for information it considered relevant to the developer's proposed acquisition of Bally stock, including information regarding Mr. Trump's &quot;present and proposed Atlantic City casino operations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
