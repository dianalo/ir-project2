For much of this year, OPEC has been trying to do both, with only partial success. Since Feb. 1, the cartel's 13 members have generally stuck to their base price of $18 a barrel, thus helping to maintain stability in world oil markets. But the group's efforts to limit output have been far less successful, putting heavy pressure on the fixed-price system, which is beginning to erode.    &quot;In a static situation, you can fix both the price and production, but in the real world you have to have a certain flexibility,&quot; Indonesia's oil minister Subroto said in a recent interview.    It is now clear that several OPEC producers have made prices more flexible than production. As previously reported, Saudi Arabia is studying market-related pricing links for some sales contracts, although Saudi officials yesterday, as expected, denied reports that they will provide price rebates to four U.S. oil companies.    Oil prices rebounded on U.S. spot and futures markets amid skepticism that Saudi Arabia would change its pricing policy. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery rose 22 cents a barrel to $19.66    The kingdom's possible move away from fixed prices followsadoption of market-related sales contracts by some others inOPEC, including Iraq and Iran. Still others may follow. It istime, said Indonesia's Mr. Subroto, that OPEC &quot;shops for newideas.&quot;   Much of the &quot;shopping&quot; won't take place until OPEC holds its regular winter conference in December. But within the organization the likely future course for the oil ministers is becoming clear. &quot;They are leaning more toward trying to fix production instead of the price,&quot; a senior OPEC official said yesterday. Added Joseph C. Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services, &quot;If they control production, the price will take care of itself.&quot;    Given a choice, the Indonesian oil minister, for one, prefers tight production controls -- but only in the hope that balancing oil supply and demand will cause prices to strengthen. Alirio A. Parra, a Petroleos de Venezuela executive and leading contender for the OPEC post of secretary-general, also argues for production restraint. He told a Southern Methodist University oil conference last week, &quot;Consistent with pricing objectives, output of OPEC oil should increase slowly in line with market developments.&quot;    Iran, Algeria and Libya long have lobbied for sharp OPEC-wide production cuts to bring about higher prices. Other members too are now beginning to favor controlling production over prices, if one judges their actions rather than their statements.    Saudi officials, for instance, continue to insist the kingdom won't any longer be OPEC's &quot;swing&quot; producer, meaning that they won't reduce output to make up for excess production by other members. But at the same time, the Saudis seem satisfied to remain within their production quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. Most other OPEC members want to maintain production rates at least near their current levels. But they may have trouble doing so as spot oil prices decline, prompting buyers to turn to lower-priced suppliers. Nigeria's volume of quality crudes drops quickly, for example, when North Sea oil becomes cheaper.    Though OPEC production has been falling in recent weeks, it is estimated at more than 18 million barrels a day, still above the 1987 second-half ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day. But the shrinking emphasis on fixed prices and the renewed emphasis on output limits is apparent in the appeal for production restraint currently being issued to OPEC's heads of state by the so-called Committee of Three -- consisting of Mr. Subroto and the Nigerian and Venezuelan oil ministers. In Saudi Arabia, this week's first stop, King Fahd assured the ministers he endorses the idea of an inspection system to hedge against quota violations. Yesterday, the production-jawboning committee went on to Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, both overproducers.    There is some doubt, of course, that OPEC could ever curb excess output if it ignores official pricing. &quot;If there is a broad move in OPEC to abandon fixed prices, the market might view it with skepticism,&quot; said a New York oil analyst. &quot;But it can work and doesn't have to damage the crude market if the production level is set right and everyone sticks to his quota.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
