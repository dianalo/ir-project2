Each aircraft manufacturer has a hangar packed full ofhardware, von Klargard said.andM;&quot;The fiber line will help in the connection process between remote computerson the base and our main number-crunching processors,&quot; he said.andM;There are several thousand Zenith Data Systems Z-248 computers in use atEdwards, von Klargaard said.andP;  Officials plan to begin using the ATandamp;T 3B2small multiuser minicomputer &quot;after we've looked a few of them over andkicked the tires,&quot; he said.andM;The Z-248s are used mostly for the Edwards management inforation system,which includes access to final test flight reports, he said.andM;&quot;You might have a little Ethernet LAN within one building that can jump outto a VAX or 3B2 if necessary,&quot; he said.andM;The different systems and computers at Edwards can make a technicaldirector's days long, but von Klargaard said diversity has its advantages.andM;&quot;Maybe the ideal situation would be for us to have just a few differentvendors whom we know and love ot bid all the contracts,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Sometimeswe have guys bidding who can't build their computer for us in the winterbecause it's too cold in their garage.andP;  On the other hand, sometimes you goto one of those garage guys and get a brilliant solution to your problem.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
