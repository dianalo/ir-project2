<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0127 </DOCNO><TEXT>The six-component subsonic static force and moment coefficients of theGPHS (General Purpose Heat Source) module and the pitch, yaw, a nd rolldamping coefficients have been constructed in the full rotational rangein angle of attack, {alpha}{sub R}, and roll angle, {phi}. The test datafrom various subsonic wind tunnel tests were used as the basis. Theseconstructions are being used to generate a subsonic data set that iscompatible with a BFD 6DOF reentry program that is being developed inparallel using the existing reentry program as the basis. The coefficientsare given in graphical form for the full range in {alpha}{sub R} and{phi} and as algebraic equivalences. These equivalences may be used tofacilitate the formulation of the data set by making use of existinglogic in available computing equipment. Test data which form the basisfor the construction are also given. 11 refs., 31 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
