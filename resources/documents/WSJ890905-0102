Mr. Laventhol, 56 years old, was named to the additional posts of publisher and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times last week, succeeding W. Thomas Johnson Jr., 47, who after nine years as publisher was named chairman of Times Mirror's newspaper management committee -- a post formerly held by Mr. Laventhol -- and chairman of the Times.    The appointment of the pensive, almost painfully shy Mr. Laventhol to succeed the charismatic Mr. Johnson caught most of the Times newsroom by surprise. Many observers wondered whether the move for Mr. Johnson was a big promotion or a boot upstairs, and Mr. Laventhol did little to ease the speculation when asked Friday how it happened that he was named publisher. &quot;These things are worked out in the appropriate way. . . . We work out what people should do,&quot; he said enigmatically.    Most observers agreed that in selecting Mr. Laventhol as publisher, Times Mirror is looking to draw from his extensive experience in the editorial side of the newspaper business. &quot;Clearly his editorial background is there, and Tom's really isn't,&quot; says John Morton, a media analyst in Washington, D.C. For his part, Mr. Johnson said in a speech last week to Times Mirror's senior executive management that &quot;I have enormous respect for Dave's reputation, his experience, his vision, his commitment to quality journalism.&quot;    The shift comes at a time when the paper, once complacent about its dominance over the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, its only competitor in the Los Angeles metropolitan market, is undergoing considerable self-analysis about its place in Southern California. Although the Times is one of the nation's biggest and most successful newspapers, with a daily circulation of more than 1.1 million, it has been unable to quash growing competition from papers in suburban areas that it once presumed were part of its empire, such as the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. And it has to battle national newspapers.    &quot;This is a time of challenge for the Times,&quot; says Mr. Laventhol. &quot;This is a very competitive newspaper area.&quot;    But, then, Mr. Laventhol, a die-hard baseball fan, knows all about competition. As publisher and chief executive of Times Mirror's Newsday newspaper in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Laventhol helped the Long Island newspaper grow in its market, then elbow its way into New York City.    The experience at Newsday may have provided some critical lessons that Mr. Laventhol can apply to the Southern California market. Just as Newsday has had to acknowledge and cater to the differences between Long Island and New York, so too must the Times appeal to the varying tastes of readers in far-flung communities. The Times has tried to do this with regional sections and &quot;zone&quot; editions that feature local news and local advertising, though Times executives were slow to get the zoned editions started and to give them the independence to launch a full-scale attack on the competition.    Mr. Laventhol, for one, is sold on the zoning concept. &quot;The Times commits much more resources to covering the region and on zoning&quot; than do other big metropolitan dailies, he says. &quot;I think that's very important and a wise investment.&quot; He says the paper will continue to focus on the growth of its regional editions: in the San Fernando Valley, where the Daily News presents a formidable challenge; in Orange County, where the Register has captured the market; and in San Diego, where the San Diego Union and the evening Tribune dominate.    That's not all. The Times has been considering a Western regional edition that could bring the paper north to the Canadian border and as far east as Denver -- and maybe a national edition. Mr. Laventhol says such expansion is &quot;one of the more important issues&quot; facing him.    Although the Times brings in more than $1 billion of revenue a year, it will take more than just throwing money into the fray to be successful with any expansion. &quot;We have to make sure that we're doing it the best way and the most efficiently,&quot; says Mr. Laventhol.    The moneymaking side of journalism isn't lost on Mr. Laventhol, who has &quot;an enormous knowledge of the whole business of newspapers,&quot; says Shelby Coffey, editor of the Los Angeles Times, who earlier in his career succeeded Mr. Laventhol as editor of the Washington Post's Style section when Mr. Laventhol left for Newsday.    Former colleagues say Mr. Laventhol has a keen ability to take limited resources and make something of them. At the Washington Post, where Mr. Laventhol helped create the renowned Style section in 1968, &quot;we had a kind of mediocre women's section, with a tiny handful of critics, and he repackaged this and made it the template for feature sections of the next 20 years,&quot; says Paul Richard, the Post's art critic who worked with Mr. Laventhol during the Style section's inception. Mr. Richard says that in addition to Mr. Laventhol's &quot;lumbering, witty, New Yorky style,&quot; he was particularly taken by the editor's strong visual sense.    Visuals have become very important to the Times in recent years, as suburban competitors, particularly the Register and the Daily News, have mastered the art of color. The Times is spending more than $400 million over the next several years for the latest in technology and a new printing plant to increase its capacity for high-quality color printing. Still, Mr. Laventhol says, &quot;it's not just color and graphics that increase readability. I think the Times will continue to be a place where in-depth reporting will be important.&quot;    The appreciation for good journalism, coming from one who worked his way up into management from the editorial side, has won Mr. Laventhol many fans among his fellow journalists. &quot;This guy is one of us. He comes out of our ranks,&quot; says Noel Greenwood, deputy managing editor of the Times. &quot;He doesn't look like a corporate type or act like a corporate type.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
