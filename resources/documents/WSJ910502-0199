Mr. Busch, the chairman of Anheuser-Busch Cos., received$7.4 million from exercising his options, far more than his$1.5 million in salary and bonus. Mr. Mayerson, a 33-year-olddirector of planning at a PepsiCo division, figures he'sstill years away from such lucrative executive stock plans.But last year, Pepsi gave him -- and everyone else at thecompany -- stock options worth 10% of salary and bonus.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I feel great,&quot; says Mr. Mayerson. &quot;It's a real long-terminducement -- it makes you feel more of an owner.&quot;   Messrs. Busch and Mayerson are part of the latest trend incompensation: Employees -- from the CEO on down to themailroom clerk -- are getting more of their compensation inthe form of variable bonuses, long-term incentives and stock.One reason is that corporations are trying to better motivatetheir employees. Companies are also hoping that by ensuringthat everyone shares alike in the corporation's success orfailure, these pay-for-performance schemes will addressrising complaints about pay inequities.   But corporations have a long way to go. For one thing,pay-for-performance plans still cover very few workers.Moreover, bonuses and stock options for CEOs are usuallyadditions to compensation packages. For those on lower rungsof the corporate ladder, however, such incentives oftenreplace all or part of the annual raise, thus saving thecompany money.   What's more, many performance plans for lower-levelemployees are more volatile than those for higher-levelexecutives. At General Motors Corp., for example, ChairmanRoger B. Smith's annual bonus fell 7% to $1.4 million inresponse to a 13% profit slide; profit sharing paid to hourlyand lower-level salaried workers fell 81% to $50 a person. GMsays higher-level bonuses are based on overall corporateresults, while lower-level profit sharing is based only onless profitable North American automotive operations.   To look closely at the trend in CEO pay, The Wall StreetJournal asked compensation consultants Towers Perrin tosurvey the compensation of chief executive officers at thecountry's biggest companies. In all 325 companies' proxieswere sampled.   The survey showed that in a year when corporate profitsoverall slid by 4.2%, median CEO cash compensation, includingsalaries and bonuses, rose by 8.0% to $1 million.   According to the survey, 1989's highest paid executives --taking into account salary, bonus and long-term payouts --included: Reebok International Ltd.'s Paul Fireman, whosecompensation totaled $14.6 million; Walt Disney Co.'s MichaelEisner, $9.6 million; Coca-Cola Co.'s Roberto C. Goizueta,$9.3 million; Anheuser-Busch's Mr. Busch, $8.9 million; Merckandamp; Co.'s P. Roy Vagelos, $6.8 million; Ford Motor Co.'s DonaldE. Petersen, $6.6 million; Philip Morris Cos.' HamishMaxwell, $6.5 million; and Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s T.Marshall Hahn Jr., $6.2 million.                                                                                                          Overall, however, because poor corporate results held downbonuses, the increase in CEO compensation wasn't as great asin the past. In some cases, CEO salary and bonus actuallydeclined. At Chemical Banking Corp., where a $482.2 millionnet loss reflected allowances for losses on internationaldebt and on a Texas bank unit, chairman Walter Shipley'ssalary and bonus fell 19% to $1.12 million from $1.38million.   Chief executives' gains from exercising stock options alsofell shy of the levels of the past few years. One majorreason was that many CEOs executed their options during thestrong stock markets of previous years. Still, stock optionsdelivered large sums for a minority of CEOs: Mr. Goizuetamade $5.9 million exercising options; Merck andamp; Co.'s P. RoyVagelos, $4.4 million.   CEOs weren't alone in profiting handsomely from stockoptions. At Walt Disney Co., President Frank Wells made $46.1million last year.   Many other chief executives may enjoy such gains in thefuture because of a growing trend toward so-called mega stockgrants, which, by common definition, total three times annualcompensation or more. Last year, according to the survey, 43companies made such grants compared with 34 in 1988. Someexamples: a grant of an option to buy one million shares witha face value of $26.9 million to Browning-Ferris IndustriesInc.'s Chairman William D. Ruckelshaus; options on 215,000shares valued at $10.2 million to Lawrence G. Rawl, chairmanof Exxon Corp. One option to buy two million shares, facevalue of $142 million, to Michael Eisner, Disney chairman, isso large that if he exercised the option, his ownership inthe company could exceed that of either of the two Disneyfamily members on the company's board.   Other companies are hedging against a possible sluggishstock market by making outright grants of stock. Of thecompanies making mega stock grants, 17 were for restrictedstock, which is owned outright by executives, subject tocertain restrictions. &quot;There is more of a bird-in-the-handmentality,&quot; says Michael Halloran, head of Towers Perrin'scompensation-consulting practice.   Many defend high CEO pay. &quot;As long as they produce and thecompany does well, I am happy and I am sure that the rest ofthe board is happy and I am sure the shareholders are happy,&quot;says Samuel L. Williams, Chairman of Disney's compensationcommittee. Says Mitchell Fromstein, chairman of Manpower PLC,who earned $1.9 million last year: &quot;The question is, Are youearning your money? I would be comfortable submitting mycompensation arrangement to the organization as a whole forratification. The organization would feel that I earn mymoney.&quot;   Still, big pay packages are increasingly drawing fire frominstitutional shareholders. Last year at Goodyear Tire andamp;Rubber Co., an &quot;omnibus&quot; plan providing for several differentkinds of stock and other incentives passed with barely 54% ofthe shareholder vote. Such a narrow margin is unusual. &quot;Itused to be a rubber stamp,&quot; says Frederick K. Hahn, untilrecently manager of executive compensation for Goodyear.   Overall, the shares voted against creating newstock-option plans rose to 9% last year from 3.5% in 1988,says Ted Jaenicke, a senior analyst at the InvestorResponsibility Research Center, a business policy researchgroup.   Employees, too, are growing restive. In recent years, saysCharles Cumming, a managing principal at Sibson andamp; Co.,compensation consultant, there has been much resentment amongemployees who wonder &quot;why the pay gap between the middle andthe top is getting bigger and bigger.&quot; According to TowersPerrin's survey, the 8% increase in CEO salary and bonuscompares with a 5.2% increase for other managers.   At one board meeting earlier this year, &quot;the issue thatgot more air time than any other was the difference betweenCEO pay and that of the rank and file,&quot; says Thomas Shea,managing director of William M. Mercer Inc., a compensationconsulting company. &quot;Board members are increasingly concernedabout the broadening gulfs between haves and have-nots,&quot; hesays. &quot;Last year, you would hear one person bring it upmeekly; this year, some people are talking about it on animpassioned and emotional level.&quot;   Several companies are trying to tighten the standards forpay at the top -- by, for instance, raising the benchmarksthat must be attained before a bonus is paid. Pearl Meyer,president of Pearl Meyer andamp; Partners, a compensationconsulting firm, finds that boards are increasingly hiringtheir own consultants to check compensation proposals fromfirms hired by management.   In one such instance, she reviewed a plan that would haveallowed executives of a large financial-services firm toexercise their stock options at a price 33% below the shares'market value on the grant date. She recommended instead aprice equal to the market value, and her advice was followed.   Some corporations are even tougher. Last year one companygranted stock options with an exercise price $3 higher thanthe market value on the grant date, says Louis Brindisi,chairman of Strategic Compensation Associates, anexecutive-compensation consulting firm. &quot;They said the first$3 of the gain goes to the stockholders,&quot; he adds. Of Mr.Eisner's options, 500,000 shares are priced $10 above themarket value on the date of the grant.   Making executives buy stock is rare. Still a few companiesare trying it. &quot;The issue of stock ownership for seniormanagement is driving more and more companies,&quot; says Mr.Halloran of Towers Perrin. &quot;They seem to think that if youget people to own more, they will act more like owners.&quot;Chrysler Corp., for example, has begun encouraging its top100 executives to buy -- and hold -- stock equal to anundisclosed percentage of salary.   At Itel Corp., key executives are given stock options butalso are offered the chance to buy far more shares. With hisown money at stake, an Itel manager &quot;has some skin in thegame,&quot; says Philip Kantz, president and CEO of ItelContainers International, an Itel unit. What's more, theoptions are exercisable at a price that rises at 5% a year.&quot;They want us, as owner-managers, to be running against thesame dilution from inflation that shareholders are,&quot; Mr.Kantz says.   At many companies, changes address complaints aboutunfairness throughout the corporation, and not pay levels atthe top. &quot;Realistically, we won't get executives to cut theirpay,&quot; says Michael Guthman, a partner in Hewitt Associates,&quot;so the only way to bridge that gap is by pushing ownershipmore broadly into the organization.&quot;   At Waste Management Inc., for instance, 6,000 of thecompany's 42,000 employees are eligible so far for stockoptions; that number should rise to 10,000 in two or threeyears. &quot;We want to have as many people in the program aspossible,&quot; a company spokesman says. &quot;We think this issomething that will reward our people for continuedproductive efforts.&quot;   Allied-Signal Inc. has doubled the number of peopleeligible for bonuses over the past five years, to between1,500 and 2,000 people today. On a base salary of $50,000 atypical bonus could be as high as $10,000, says Edwin M.Halkyard, senior vice president for human resources.   Overall, according to a William M. Mercer survey, 26% ofcompanies that offer some incentives offered them to a widerrange of employees in 1988 and 1989 than in the past.   Increasing motivation is one reason for the switch. &quot;Allthe evidence -- both anecdotal and from carefully constructedexperimentation -- reinforces the fact that when you have payat risk you get better performance,&quot; says Donald Guerette, avice president of Time Warner Inc., which is experimentingwith such plans. Says Bruce Ellig, vice president forpersonnel of Pfizer Inc.: &quot;We have to make sure that thedollars are allocated to the better performers. It's azero-sum game. Not as much will be allocated to the averageperformer.&quot;   Many such plans substitute for part of an employee'ssalary. At Du Pont Co., for example, employees in one largepilot program forgo 2% of their salary increase each year forthree years to finance a profit-sharing plan. The plan thenpays out based on the amount of money each employee has &quot;atrisk&quot; and according to the department's results.   Corning Inc. paid for a new bonus program by havingeveryone &quot;from secretaries to chairman&quot; forgo one year'sannual raise. The annual bonuses now are based on companyperformance in hitting targets for a return on equity. In1988 the payment was 7.5% of salary; in 1989 it was 8.7%. Butif corporate results go down, so too, do employees'paychecks. &quot;We just aren't going to keep paying people thesame amount of money if the company isn't performing,&quot; saysPaul Regan, a senior vice president.   Many worry, however, that these plans will cause problemsdown the road if corporate results decline further or thestock market collapses. &quot;They are generally put in at a timewhen they are going to pay off,&quot; says John Rogers, vicepresident and a managing director of Hay Group Inc, aconsulting firm.   Despite such fears, &quot;no one is turning down&quot; these bigstock packages, says Mr. Halloran of Towers Perrin, referringto CEOs. Neither are their subordinates. &quot;I haven't heardanybody complain,&quot; says Pepsi's Mr. Mayerson.   ---                        Just Rewards                                                                                                          Here's a breakdown of some typical long-term compensationplans, adapted from Sibson andamp; Co.'s 1990executive-compensation report                                                                                                                           Incentive stock options                                                                                                          Description                                                                                                          A right granted by employer to purchase stock at astipulated price during a specified period of time inaccordance with Section 422A of Internal Revenue code.
