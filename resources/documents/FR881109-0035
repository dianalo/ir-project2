Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. We also preliminarily determine that critical circumstancesexist with respect to imports of certain classes or kinds of AFBs fromthe FRG, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of thisnotice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On May 17, 1988, the ITC determined that there isreasonable indication that U.S. industries are materially injured by reasonof imports of the subject merchandise from the FRG (53 FR 18909, May 25,1988).On May 31, 1988, the Department presented Section A of the antidumpingduty questionnaires to FAG Kugelfischer George Schafer KgA (FAG); GeorgMuller Nurnberg AG (GMN); INA Walzlager Schaeffler (INA); and SKF KugellagerfabrikenGmbH (SKF). These companies account for a substantial portion of exportsof the subject merchandise from the FRG to the United States during theperiod of investigation. The remaining sections of the questionnaire wereissued on June 15, 1988. Responses to Section A were due on June 14, 1988,and responses to the remaining sections were due on July 15, 1988.On July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandum stating that the subjectmerchandise constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise (<T3>see, </T3>``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice).In light of this decision, the Department re-examined the sufficiency ofpetitioner's less than fair value (LTFV) allegations for each class orkind of merchandise from the FRG. The Department afforded petitioner anopportunity to provide additional information in support of its LTFV allegationsfor particular classes or kinds of merchandise where needed. On August1, 2, and 29, 1988, petitioner submitted additional data. We determinedthat petitioner provided sufficient information in support of the LTFVallegations for each class or kind of merchandise from the FRG.On July 15, 1988, the Department determined that these investigations areextraordinarily complicated in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)of the Act, and postponed the preliminary determinations until no laterthan October 27, 1988 (53 FR 27738, July 22, 1988).On August 8, 1988, we issued revised reporting requirements based on ourdecision to simplify these investigations (<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Accordingly, response deadlines were extended several times, with the finaldue date for responses being no later than September 6, 1988. A numberof supplemental and deficiency questionnaires were issued subsequent tothat date. Supplemental responses were received from the respondents priorto these preliminary determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging The Torrington Company's standingto file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the groundsthat it was not filed by ``an interested party'' ``on behalf of'' the UnitedStates industry as required by section 732(b)(1) of the Act. Section 771(9)(c)of the Act defines ``interested party'' to include ``a manufacturer, producer,or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' With the exceptionof an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,'' the ITC categorizationof the subject merchandise into six like products is identical to the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations. Torringtonhas demonstrated that it produces all five classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer, producer or wholesalerin the United States of the like products under investigation, and is an``interested party'' with standing to file this petition.The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry.'' Section732(b)(1) of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases (<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February28, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia </T3>(50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985),the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the petition. The Departmentbases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor its legislativehistory restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiring that partiespetitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmatively that amajority of the members of the relevant domestic industry support the petition.The only requirement is that the party filing the petition act as the representativeof the domestic industry.When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorproportion of the domestic industry.In order to determine whether a major proportion of the domestic industryopposes the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of The Torrington Company. Responsesto the standing questionnaires are due on October 28, 1988. We will continueto examine the standing issue for purposes of the final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS) and all the merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date willbe classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Untilthat time, however, the Department will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions. Aswith the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The Department's written description of the products under investigationremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all petitions filed with the Departmentthrough the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.20230. Additionally, all U.S. Customs offices have reference copies, andpetitioners may contact the import specialist at their local Customs officeto consult the schedule. For a complete description of the products subject to these investigations,see Appendix I attached to this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>In our notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), we treated thesubject merchandise as one ``class or kind of merchandise.'' Subsequentto initiation, we received numerous comment from petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties in these investigations on whether the subjectmerchandise constitutes one or more classes or kinds of merchandise. Aftercareful consideration of all views expressed, and based on our discussionswith product experts at the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and within theDepartment, we issued a decision memorandum on July 13, 1988, stating thatthe subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kinds of merchandise,as follows; 1. Ball Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Ball Bearings).2. Spherical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (SphericalRoller Bearings). 3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Cylindrical Roller Bearings). 4. Needle Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (NeedleRoller Bearings). 5. Plain Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Plain Bearings).This July 13, 1988 decisions memorandum is on file in the Central RecordsUnit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Reporting Requirements </ITAG>Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.38, the Department ``normally will examine at least60 percent of the dollar volume of exports to the United States from anycountry subject to an antidumping investigation.'' Due to the enormousvolume of sales by respondents during the period of investigation and thecomplexity of identifying similar merchandise, we have attempted to reducethe reporting requirements for respondents while maintaining a reasonablebasis for our analysis. Accordingly, on July 15, 1988, we issued a letterto all interested parties requesting comments on two alternatives to ourstandard methodology. One alternative was to select at random a certainnumber of products sold in the United States and to compare the U.S. pricesfor those products with the home market prices of identical or similarmerchandise, as appropriate. The second alternative was as follows: if at least 33 percent by volumeof the respondent's U.S. sales could be compared to home market sales ofidentical products, then fair value comparisons would be limited to identicalcomparisons. If a respondent failed to reach the 33 percent requirementwith identical matches, then, in addition to identical comparisons, wewould compare the largest volume products sold in the United States tosimilar products sold in the home market within each class or kind categoryuntil the 33 percent threshold was met. After reviewing comments from interested parties on this issue, we selectedthe second alternative. The August 5, 1988 memorandum explaining the proceduresoutlined above is on file in the Central Records Unit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Production Allegations </ITAG>Based on information presented in the petition and supplemental submissions,on April 20, 1988, we initiated an investigation of sales at LTFV fromthe FRG. At that time, we also initiated an investigation of whether salesin the home markets were being made at prices below the cost of production(COP). As stated above, on July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandumstating that the products under investigation constitute five separateclasses or kinds of merchandise. (<T3>See, </T3>``Class or Kind of Merchandise''; section of this notice.)Accordingly, on July 22, 1988, the Department requested that petitionersubmit evidence of sales at below the COP for each class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for which sufficient information had not been provided.In addition, several respondents objected to the Department's decisionsto initiate COP investigations. Citing <T3>Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States, </T3>575 F. Supp. 1277(CIT 1983) (<T3>Al Tech</T3>), these respondents argued that petitioner's sales belowcost allegations were deficient because they were based on country-wide,rather than company-specific home market pricing data. After review ofthese comments, the <T3>Al Tech </T3>decisions, and Section 773(b), on August 22, 1988, wediscontinued the COP investigations, but allowed petitioner additionaltime to submit company-specific home market price information to substantiateits allegations of sales at below the COP. The August 22, 1988 decisionmemorandum outlining our analysis of this issue is on file in the CentralRecords Unit. Petitioner submitted such new allegations of home marketsales below the COP. After analyzing petitioner's new allegations and the numerous supplementsthereto, we have determined that sufficient company-specific allegationshave been provided with respect to the following investigations: 1. Ball Bearings_SKF, FAG, GMN. 2. Spherical Roller Bearings_FAG. 3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_SKF, INA, FAG. 4. Needle Roller Bearings_SKF, FAG. Therefore, the Department has reinstated COP investigations for these companieson the classes or kinds of AFBs. listed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Respondents</ITAG>On July 1, 1988, we issued questionnaires to companies which had expressedinterest in submitting voluntary responses in these investigations. OnJuly 26 and 27, 1988, we received voluntary responses from MaschinenfabrikJoseph Eich KG u. Partner GmbH and ASK Kugellagerfabrik Artur Seyfert GmbH,respectively, producers of certain AFBs in the FRG. These responses containedmaterial deficiencies. Therefore, they were not considered for the purposesof these investigations. Accordingly, the AFBs exported by these producerswill be subject to the ``All Other'' rate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation is October 1, 1987 through March 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether there are sufficient sales of the subject merchandisein the home market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign marketvalue, we normally compare the volume of home market sales to the volumeof sales to third countries within each respective such or similar category.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed thematching criteria set forth in <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan, </T3>(52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, we sought and considered commentsfrom interested parties and consulted product experts at the U.S. CustomsService, the ITC, and within the Department. Given the enormous numberof products sold and the numerous physical permutations among bearing types,it would have been virtually impossible to determine home market viabilitybased on such or similar categories within each class or kind of merchandise.Therefore, home market viability was calculated based on home market andthird country sales of each class or kind of Merchandise. Pursuant to our alternative reporting requirements, where 33 percent ormore of U.S. sales by volume were identical in all physical respects tohome market products, comparisons of similar merchandise were unnecessary(<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).In those instances where similar comparisons were necessary for a givenclass or kind of merchandise, we instructed respondents first to narrowthe pool of possible product comparisons by matching each of the followingcriteria: (1) Number of rows of rolling elements, (2) load direction, (3)bearing design, and (4) precision rating. Respondents were then to applya ten percent deviation test to each bearing in this pool of possible productcomparisons based on the (a) outside diameter, (b) inside diameter, (c)width, and (d) dynamic load rating to determine the most similar home marketcomparison. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from the FRG to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance withsection 776(c) of the Act, where a company has submitted a response whichwe consider to be substantially deficient, or has submitted informationtoo late to be considered for purposes of these preliminary determinations,we relied on best information available. Those instances where we usedbest information available are fully described below. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements:1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent; 2. This was a customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer. Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for containerization, foreign inland freight, import brokerage, importduties, marine insurance, foreign inland insurance, U.S. inland freight,and U.S. inland insurance, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of theAct. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for advertising,credit, repacking in the United States, technical service expenses, thirdparty payments, warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses and commissionspursuant to Section 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. For certain transactions, no amounts were reported for brokerage and handling,duty, U.S. inland freight, credit, and warranty expenses. As best informationavailable, we found the average of each of the expenses and compared itto the average gross price reported. The resultant percentages were thenapplied, individually, to the gross price reported for each transactionin which these expenses were not reported. FAG claimed an adjustment for losses or gains under ``other revenue'' onESP sales. This loss or gain represents the per unit difference betweenthe actual return in deutsche mark to FAG and the theoretical return indeutsche mark which FAG expected to receive at the time FAG priced itsproducts, due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Since these products wereactually priced and invoiced in U.S. dollars, there is no need to adjustUnited States price. Therefore, we disallowed this adjustment. We have excluded from our calculation of United States price sales of bearingsby FAG to the U.S. government for military/defense procurement. These saleswere made under Schedule 8 of the TSUSA and will not be subject to anyantidumping duties. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Affirmative Antidumping Duty Determination; TitaniumSponge from Japan, </T3>(49 FR 38687, October 1, 1984).] These importswere made prior to enactment of Section 1335 of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988 and will not be subject to suspension of liquidation. Withrespect to any future sales to the U.S. government, we will determine whetherthese sales are exempt from antidumping duties pursuant to the terms ofsection 1335 of the 1988 Act. We also excluded from our calculation of United States price, replacementbearings for defective products, and bearings used as promotional samples;both provided free-of-charge to FAG's customers. FAG reported purchase price sales of ball bearings in its deficiency response.However, these constitute a minimal percentage of FAG's sales to the UnitedStates. Therefore, we did not include these sales in our calculation ofUnited States price. B. <T3>BMN: </T3>GMN reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)In order to determine identical merchandise in both the U.S. and home markets,we instructed respondents to assign identical products a unique ``controlnumber.'' In its response, GMN, for the most part, appears to have donethis. However, in some instances, GMN appears to have assigned differentcontrol numbers to products it considered to be identical. Since we arenot satisfied that matched products with different control numbers arein fact identical, we have limited our fair value analysis to those productswith matching control numbers for purposes of the preliminary determination.All of GMN's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b., and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S.duty, and U.S. inland freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) ofthe Act. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit,indirect selling expenses, and commissions, pursuant to sections 772(e)(1)and (2) of the Act. Although requested in our questionnaire, GMN did not report inventory carryingcosts on its U.S. sales. Therefore, as best information available, we calculatedinventory carrying costs based on information contained in GMN's narrativeresponse and computer data base. C. <T3>INA: </T3>INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market. matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. In its initial submission, INA did not report sales of any finished bearingswhich contained imported components and were further manufactured in theUnited States. In a letter dated August 22, 1988. The Department instructedINA to report all sales of such merchandise made during the period of investigation.While we received revised sales information which included such merchandise,it was received too late to be used for the preliminary determination.Therefore, we have used the earlier sales information as best informationavailable. All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling (which included containerization, marine insurance, ocean freight,U.S. inland freight and insurance), foreign inland freight, foreign inlandinsurance, and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for warranty expenses,and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) ofthe Act. For the following expenses, INA used the same allocation rates for U.S.sales of merchandise from INA-FRG, INA-France and INA-UK: brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, packing andnon-U.S. selling expenses. The Department has requested that INA calculateseparate allocation rates, by country, for these charges. Also, INA hascalculated its foreign inland freight, ocean freight and packing basedupon value rather than weight or volume. We have requested that INA calculaterevised allocation rates for these expenses based upon how their costswere incurred (<T3>i.e., </T3>by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of the preliminarydetermination, we have accepted INA's allocation rates as the best informationavailable. D. <T3>SKF: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent (<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice),SKF had to report both identical and similar home market matches whichwe used in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, duty, foreign inland freight, inland freight,marine insurance, and ocean freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for cash discountsand rebates. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forcommissions, credit, repacking expenses in the United States, technicalservice expenses, warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses, pursuantto sections 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.SKF reported purchase price sales of ball bearings during the POI. However,these constituted a minimal percentage of SKF sales to the United States.Therefore, we did not include these sales in our calculation of UnitedStates price.In its narrative response, SKF provided an average unit charge for foreigninland freight for each of the three SKF companies under investigationin the FRG. However, in its data submissions, SKF did not report valuesfor this charge. Therefore, we calculated foreign inland freight basedon the information provided in its narrative response.SKF claimed that the category ``other expenses'' should be used as an adjustmentto its United States price to account for data entry and invoicing errors.The data included both positive and negative values. Given that SKF didnot provide any information regarding how this adjustment should be treated,<T3>i.e.,</T3> whether it should be added or subtracted from United Statesprice, we added these expenses to United States price.II. Spherical Roller Bearings<T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP for spherical roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. FAG reported purchase price sales of spherical roller bearings in its originalresponse. However, these constitute a minimal percenteage of FAG's salesto the United States. Therefore, we did not include these sales in ourcalculation of United States priceIII. Cylindrical Roller BearingsA <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP for cylindrical roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings.FAG reported purchase price sales of cylindrical roller bearings in itsdeficiency response. However, these constitute a minimal percentage ofFAG's sales to the United States. Therefore, we did not include these salesin our calculation of United States price. B. <T3>INA:</T3> INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used al U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for cylindricalroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustements were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. C. <T3>SKF:</T3> SKF rported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for cylindricalroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings, except for commissions (which are applicableonly to sales of ball bearings).IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of FAG's U.S. sales were ESP transactions.

(<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. European port pricesto unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions from purchaseprice, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, in accordance withsection 772(d)(2) of the Act.We calculated ESP for plain bearings based on packed, f.o.b. or deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustments wereidenticial to those described above for ball bearings expect for commissions(which are applicable only to sales of ball bearings.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales. The calculation of foreign market valueof each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on packed, c.i.f.prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions fromthe home market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing, and discounts and rebates. We added U.S. packing tothe home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for commissions, credit, technicalservice expenses, and warranty expenses. We also deducted certain indirectselling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home marketproducts used in fair value comparisons are identical to the products soldin the United States, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandisewere required. FAG claimed product liability premiums and advertising expenses as directselling expenses. These claims were not adequately supported and, therefore,we treated them as indirect selling expenses. FAG's response included a claim for home market ``indirect selling expenses''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, FAGfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of these indirect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination. B. <T3>GMN: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing and cash discounts. We added U.S. packing to the homemarket price in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. GMN claimed a deductionfor commissions paid in the home market, some of which appear to have beenpaid to related parties. Given that the response has not clearly describedthe terms and conditions of the commissions, we have only considered asdirect expenses those commissions paid to unrelated parties. Those commissionspaid to related parties have been treated as indirect selling expenses,which have been deducted, along with other indirect selling expenses, inaccordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products used infair value comparisons are identical to the products sold in the UnitedStates, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required.GMN calculated home market inland freight based on a sampling of home marketshipments. For purposes of this preliminary determination, we have acceptedrespondent's information as the best information available. We have notifiedGMN that this information must be supplemented and verified in order tobe considered for purposes of the final determination. C. <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customs in the home market. We added interest revenue earnedon each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductions from the homemarket price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing, and discounts and rebates. We added U.S. packing tothe home market price in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we deducted credit expenses fromhome market price. We also deducted certain indirect selling expenses inaccordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products used infair value comparisons are identical to the products sold in the UnitedStates, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required.INA's response included a claim for home market ``indirect selling expenses''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaries, INAfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of these indirect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for the purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination. INA has calculated its foreign inland freight and packing based on valuerather than weight or volume. We have requested that INA calculate revisedallocation rates for these expenses based upon how their costs were incurred(i.e., by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of the preliminary determination,we have accepted INA's allocation rates as the base information available.D. <T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value based on c andamp; f orc.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We added interestrevenue earned on each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductionsfrom the home market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and homemarket packing. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit and warranty expenses.We also deducted certain indirect selling expenses in accordance with 19CFR 353.15(c). We made further adjustments where applicable, to the homemarket price to account for physical differences in merchandise in accordancesection 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. SKF stated that it calculated its home market packing costs based on twocharges: transport packing and product packing. For product packing, SKFbased its calculation on the ten highest priced products. We disallowedthis portion of home market packing for all sales because we were not satisfiedthat SKF's methodology appropriately valued these expenses. SKF's response included a claim for home market ``indirect selling expenses''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, SKFfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of these indirect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for the purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination. SKF claimed home market cash discounts, rebates, and technical servicesas direct selling expenses. However, those claims were not adequately supportedand, therefore, we treated them as indirect selling expenses.  SKF also claimed an adjustment for a category labelled ``other expenses''.However, no description of these expenses was provided. Therefore, theseexpenses were disallowed.  II. Spherical Roller Bearings  A. <T3>FAG:</T3> Following the methodology for determining home market viability,we found that the home market sales of spherical roller bearings were notof a sufficient quantity to provide an adequate basis for foreign marketvalue. (<T3> See</T3>, ``Such or Similar'' section of this notice.) In our originalquestionnaire, we had requested that respondent provide third country salesinformation where the home market was determined to be not viable. FAGdid not provide us with this information. Therefore, on September 26, 1988,we issued a letter to FAG again requesting third country sales data. OnSeptember 29, and October 4, 1988, FAG submitted arguments challengingthe Department's finding that the home market is not viable. Moreover,while respondent argued that it would not be possible to provide thirdcountry data in a timely manner, it did indicate that it would be ableto submit constructed value information, which it did on October 6 and20, 1988. However, this information was submitted too late to be consideredfor the preliminary determination. Therefore, we had to rely on best informationavailable as required by section 776(c) of the Act, which for this determinationwas FAG's non-viable home market sales information. We calculated foreignmarket value for spherical roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings.  III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings  A. <T3>FAG:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the homemarket. The adjustments were identical to those described above for ballbearings.  B. <T3>INA:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings. C. <T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on the c andamp; f or c.i.f. prices to unrelated customersin the home market. The adjustments were identical to those described abovefor ball bearings.  IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. <T3>FAG:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for needle roller bearingsbased on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>INA:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for needle roller bearingsbased on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. Theadjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.C. <T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for needle roller bearingsbased on the c andamp; f or c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. The adjustments were identical to those described above for ballbearings.  V. Plain BearingsA. <T3>FAG:</T3> We calculated foreign market value for plain bearings basedon the packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>SKF:</T3> We calculated foreign market value based on c andamp; f orc.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We added interestrevenue earned on each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductionsfrom the home market price, where appropriate, for inland freight. We addedU.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)of the Act.  For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expensesand U.S. technical service expenses pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15. Since allhome market products used in the fair value comparisons are identical tothe products sold in the United States, no adjustments for physical differencesin merchandise were required.  For comparisons involving ESP, we calculated foreign market value for plainbearings based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings. SKF stated that it calculated its home market packing costs based on twocharges: transport packing and product packing. For product packing, SKFbased its calculation on the ten highest priced products. For the reasonsdiscussed above, we disallowed this portion of home market packing forall sales. In addition, for transport packing on sales of plain bearings,SKF allocated transport packing costs to all sales during the period ofinvestigation although the narrative response states that packing is generallynot included in the price for certain customers. Therefore, we also disallowedSKF's home market claim for the transport packing portion of home marketpacking costs for SKF sales of plain bearings.SKF claimed home market technical service expenses as a direct sellingexpense. However, that claim was not adequately supported and, therefore,we treated these expenses as indirect selling expenses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the FRG. Section733(e)(1) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 733(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports. We have determined in past investigations whether imports have been massiveby examining the Department's import data. However, because the Department'simport data pertaining to the subject merchandise are based on basket TSUSAcategories, we determined in these investigations that company-specificdata on shipments of the subject merchandise are the most appropriate basisfor our preliminary determinations of critical circumstances. Furthermore,we believe that company-specific critical circumstances determinationsbetter fulfill the objective of the critical circumstances provision ofdeterring specific companies that may try to increase imports massivelyprior to the suspension of liquidation. We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. SKF has failed to provide the Department with shipmentdata for plain bearings. Therefore, as best information available, we areassuming that imports of plain bearings form SKF have been massive overa relatively short period of time. Based on our analysis of the monthlyshipment data submitted by respondents, we have preliminarily found thatthere is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that imports of the followingclasses or kinds of merchandise form the companies listed below have beenmassive over a relatively short period of time.<ITAG tagnum="14">1. Ball Bearings_INA, SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2. Spherical Roller Bearings_FAG </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_FAG, SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">4. Needle Roller Bearings_SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">5. Plain Bearings_SKF</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise. We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by FRG manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 733(e)(1)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.[<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy </T3>(52FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR12552, April 15, 1988).] Since FAG, INA, and SKF sell in the United Statesthrough related companies, and their margins are sufficiently high, wefind that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(A) are met for these companieswith respect to the classes or kinds listed below. Therefore, the followingchart sets forth our company-specific preliminary determinations with respectto the existence of critical circumstances for each company and each classor kind of merchandise form the FRG. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs22</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Critical circumstances:</H1> Ball bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">GMN <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">INA <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Spherical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others <D>Yes. </D></ITAG>Cylindrical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">INA <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>Yes. </D></ITAG>Needle roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">INA <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Plain bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No.</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We will verify the information used in making our final determinationsin accordance with section 776(b) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandiseform the FRG, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section ofthis notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of theAct.
