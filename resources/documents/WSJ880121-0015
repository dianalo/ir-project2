Blockers Inc. said it has completed trial runs for a new cigarette with an additive designed to lower the risk of lung cancer associated with smoking.    The company said the cigarette, produced on conventional cigarette-making machines, contains an additive that neutralizes, or blocks, the action of nitrosamines, a major family of carcinogens that are found in cigarette smoke.    The Louisville, Ky.-based company said it has completed trial runs for the cigarette and will seek to incorporate the technology into a conventional cigarette that offers smokers a significant reduction in health risk.    No government approval is necessary for the additive, the company said.    The company said it expects to market the additive in 1988 under the trademark N-Bloctin and make it available to other cigarette makers under license as well as in a brand that C.A. Blockers intends to market. </TEXT></DOC>
