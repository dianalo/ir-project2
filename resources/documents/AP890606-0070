The five-man military tribunal said the prosecution failed toproduce evidence that Maj. Horacio Lactao disregarded lawful ordersfrom a superior officer.   Lactao led about 30 soldiers aboard a column of tanks andarmored personnel carriers from the army training camp in NuevaEcija province to Manila at the height of the bloodiest of six coupattempts against Mrs. Aquino.   The coup on Aug. 28, 1987, left at least 53 people dead andhundreds others wounded.   Military troops loyal to Mrs. Aquino blocked Lactao's groupbefore it entered Manila. Lactao said he did not violate any orderswhen he led the convoy back to the training camp on his own.   Last year, Lactao and his men were cleared by another courtmartial of charges of mutiny.</TEXT></DOC>
