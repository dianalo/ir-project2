Now, thecompany's future may hinge on how well it communicates withits customers and investors.   The Plano, Texas, maker of telephone switching andsignaling equipment last week became the focus of an intenseinvestigation into a series of interruptions of local phoneservice in areas served by Bell Atlantic Corp. and PacificTelesis Group. In each case, the problems involved signalingequipment and software made by DSC. On Friday, DSC, BellAtlantic and Pacific Telesis Group said in a joint statementthey had duplicated the crisis in a laboratory and DSC haddeveloped a software change, which has been installed, toprevent the problem from recurring.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;What we found was the cause of the avalanche,&quot; said JohnW. Seazholtz, Bell Atlantic's vice president for technologyand information services. Mr. Seazholtz said a variety ofrelatively minor events, including a malfunctioning circuitboard and a computer clock that was out of sync, resulted ina malfunction of a DSC Signal Transfer Point or STP, acomputer that routes calls swiftly through the complextelephone network.   Instead of sending a few messages indicating trouble, thecomputer sent an avalanche of messages that jammed thetelephone network, disrupting phone service. Since thesoftware fix was installed, Mr. Seazholtz said, the DSCcomputers still overreacted to &quot;maintenance events&quot; but theydidn't shut down and the problem didn't spread.   The companies today will begin a national test on thesignaling system to determine the root cause of the servicedisruptions. &quot;These things are very complex,&quot; Mr. Seazholtzsaid. &quot;You have multiple processors and multiple offices.&quot;The tests will try to determine what happens when thesignaling system must cope with both heavy telephone trafficand a maintenance problem, such as a faulty circuit board.DSC's new software as well as the older version will betested.   Still, DSC isn't taking any responsibility for thetroubles that have the telecommunications industry in anuproar. The joint statement Friday avoided any mention of whois to blame for the system malfunctions. Questions to BellAtlantic about DSC's part in the outages or the investigationwere referred to DSC. DSC officials didn't return phonecalls.   Whether or not the failures are eventually laid at DSC'sdoor, the company has much to lose if it hasn't handled thiscrisis deftly. Even if the problems turn out to be withindustry standards, as DSC has hinted, rather than with itsequipment or software, analysts say customers might bereluctant to buy the signaling system, which accounted forabout 12% of its 1990 sales. The publicity alone &quot;couldplague them for a long time,&quot; said Eric Zimits, analyst withRauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. And if the failure isblamed on DSC's equipment, it could also affect sales of thecompany's other products.   &quot;In general, phone companies are interested in buyingequipment that works reliably and doesn't cause them a lot oftrouble,&quot; said Robert Wilkes of Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co.&quot;If DSC's reputation is damaged, their customers could stopbuying from them.&quot;   Wednesday, DSC told analysts in a conference call that ithad dispatched 200 technicians to investigate the problem andhad created seven internal task forces to root out possibleproblems. The move was widely seen as an attempt to temperinvestor fears that a glitch in its equipment or software mayhave caused the Baltimore-Washington area, Los Angeles andPittsburgh to lose local phone service for several hours inrecent days. San Francisco twice lost service, but just for afew minutes, because it was closely monitoring its system andrerouted traffic around the faulty computer.   But until the cause of the outages was proven, the companymade it clear that it wasn't willing to take the rap. DSC,angered that Bell Atlantic officials indicated DSC was atfault, insisted on issuing a joint news release thattelephone companies and all their suppliers were workingtogether to resolve the problem.   In Washington, losing its service for most of June 26 cameas a shock to the system. The Federal CommunicationsCommission scheduled an unusual closed-door meeting fortomorrow to consider &quot;possible investigatory or enforcementaction.&quot; And on Capitol Hill, the House Government OperationsCommittee scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to investigatethe network breakdowns.   When phone service is &quot;disrupted on such a large scale andin so many different places, it raises some pretty seriousquestions,&quot; said Rep. Bob Wise (D., W.Va.), whose districtwas affected by the June 26 phone outage. &quot;We just want toget to the bottom of this as quickly as possible and see whatcan be done to prevent these situations from reoccurring.&quot;   At the heart of the probe, clearly, are DSC computers andsoftware, which make telephone equipment more intelligent. Byone estimate, those products were expected to ring up salesgains of 35% a year for the next few years; DSC recordedabout $60 million in 1990 sales of signaling systems andrecently installed its 100th system, making it one of thenation's largest makers of such equipment.   Five of the seven Baby Bells have purchased DSC equipmentand software to upgrade their networks to use SignalingSystem 7, the generic name for the latest signaling system,which also is made by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. andothers. The system speeds dialing by beginning to route callsthrough the network even as the caller dials the phonenumber, instead of waiting until the caller is finisheddialing. The systems also allow telephone companies to offerservices that identify the caller and trace calls.   Analysts said they can't estimate what kind of impact thecurrent troubles may have on DSC's results, but the stockmarket apparently is concerned. While DSC's stock wasunchanged Friday, at $6.25, in over-the-counter trading, itfell 50 cents from Tuesday and $1 from Monday.   The switching mystery marks another setback for the15-year-old company, a one-time high-flyer that has had morethan its share of troubles. Founded in 1976 as Digital SwitchCorp. to develop new technology for long-distance companies,the company took six years to roll out its first product. Inthose early years, the company relied on a couple ofcustomers and earnings were erratic. In 1985, DSC was forcedto restate a year and a half of financial results because itbooked sales that customers said they didn't have to honor.The company signed a consent agreement with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission in 1989 that required it to againrestate 1984-85 results. Last year, it settled a relatedclass-action lawsuit for $30 million.   Despite the problems, the company has flourished, posting$519.3 million in sales last year, up from $27.4 million in1982. And a March report from Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp. pinned high hopes on some of DSC's moreadvanced products. A start-up company that makes equipmentallowing fiber optics to be used for local phone service wasacquired for $54 million last year and is expected tocontribute $45 million in sales this year, up from $8 millionin 1990, by selling largely to the Baby Bells.   But steady profit gains have proved elusive. Net incomefell 40% in 1990 to $20.1 million, or 47 cents a share, from1989; the company blamed a weak economy, consolidation amongcustomers and a $6.3 million charge, including an assetwrite-down and other one-time costs.   Analysts say the company's gross profit margins of about37% are below the industry average of about 40%, and wellbelow the company's potential gross margins of 45% or more.Further, DSC's inventory and customer receivables are higherthan their competitors, primarily ATandamp;T and Northern TelecomLtd., analysts say.   &quot;They're an underachiever,&quot; said Joseph Bellace of MerrillLynch.</TEXT></DOC>
