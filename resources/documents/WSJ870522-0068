But in doing so, what is now the nation's largest textile concern may eventually become a shadow of its former self.    In agreeing to a $76-a-share, $2.07 billion leveraged buyout led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington faces a markedly increased debt burden and heightened pressure to contain its costs. Industry executives and analysts expect Burlington to sell assets to reduce the debt; they also expect the company to trim overhead and close some unprofitable operations.    Thus, Burlington will probably end up doing many of the same things that Asher B. Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc. had been expected to do if their $72-a-share tender offer had succeeded.    Burlington will be &quot;sliced and diced in every direction,&quot; according to a source familiar with the leveraged-buyout transaction. Among the assets likely to be put up for sale are the company's denim operations, which include a North Carolina factory considered by some to be the most modern denim factory in the world. Ironically, some analysts consider Montreal-based Dominion to be a prime candidate to buy the denim business.    For Burlington, a daunting fact is that leveraged buyouts haven't worked very successfully in the textile and apparel businesses. The large debt loads incurred by the companies hamper capital spending necessary to modernize plants and remain competitive.    &quot;It's a different environment,&quot; said James C. Fry, president of Ti-Caro Inc., a Gastonia, N.C.-based textile concern that went private in a $191.8 million leveraged buyout in 1984. The company, citing its debt burden as one factor, agreed in March to be acquired by Dixie Yarns Inc., Chattanooga, Tenn.    In Burlington's case, the debt level will be particularly high. Sources familiar with the proposed transaction say Morgan Stanley is putting only $125 million of its own money into the transaction as equity, along with an additional $95 million as a bridge loan. Bankers Trust Co. will lead a syndicate of banks that will provide as much as $1.85 billion in financing for the rest of the purchase price.    In New York, Mr. Edelman said, &quot;I'm looking at my alternatives and awaiting details of their (Morgan Stanley's) offer before I have anything further to say.&quot;    Mr. Edelman isn't likely to back off quietly. Last year, when Fruehauf Corp. agreed to a leveraged buyout led by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., spurning Mr. Edelman's $44-a-share tender proposal, Mr. Edelman responded by suing to block the purchase. A federal court ruled in Mr. Edelman's favor, forcing Merrill Lynch to raise its bid for Fruehauf and to pay Mr. Edelman $21 million in expenses to make him go away.    &quot;This could be Fruehauf all over again,&quot; said a source close to Mr. Edelman and Dominion.    In Montreal, Dominion declined to comment except to say, &quot;We're reviewing the situation.&quot;    The Edelman-Dominion partnership owns a 13.4% stake in Burlington and stands to make a profit of about $90 million if it sells its shares to the Morgan Stanley group. Under the leveraged-buyout plan, a tender offer is expected to begin early next week.    A source close to Burlington said that half of Burlington's divisions have been breaking even or posting losses and would be ripe candidates for divestiture, while &quot;the other half were cash cows.&quot;    About 55% of Burlington's fiscal 1986 sales of $2.78 billion were in apparel fabrics, some lines of which have been hit hard by import competition. The company is expected to keep keep much of its home products businesses -- including carpets and rugs -- and industrial fabrics divisions, which together accounted for about 40% of fiscal 1986 sales.    Burlington also is expected to close less efficient plants in a more aggressive manner than in the past. Thus, while the North Carolina legislature passed anti-takeover measures aimed at repelling a hostile takeover and preserving the approximately 20,000 Burlington jobs in the state, many employees may be out of work anyway.    Burlington's senior management would remain in place under the proposed buyout, however, and executives would be invited to acquire equity in the company upon completion of the tender offer, according to Burlington.    Burlington shares closed yesterday at $75.125, up $2.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales.    ---   BURLINGTON'S SALES   Apparel fabrics   $1.52 billion   54.7%   Textured and   spun yarns   $144.3 million   5.2%   Carpets and rugs   $437.9 million   15.8%   Domestics*   $64.4 million   2.3%   Decorative fabrics   $310.4 million   11.2%   Industrial products   $301 million   10.8%   1986 Total Sales   $2.78 billion   *The domestics division   was sold in fiscal 1986</TEXT></DOC>
