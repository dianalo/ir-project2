(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>APS Rises Like Phoenix Into Next CenturyandM;With billions of dollars on the line in 13 major information programs, two ofthem on the Presidential Priority list, senior Commerce Department IRMofficials see strategic planning as a top priority.andM;Their close oversight of systems at Commerce's 13 operating units has notgone unnoticed.andP;  For one thing, they have won the confidence of the GeneralServices Administration IRM Service in the form of the government's largestdelegation of procurement authority, $17.5 million.andM;But nowhere has senior-level oversight paid off more than with the Patent andTrademark Office's $600 million Automated Patent System (APS), which Commercemanaged to pull out of serious trouble in the mid-1980s.andM;Thomas P. Giammo, assistant PTO commissioner for information systems, isdetermined to avid the snags PTO and other agencies have encountered inbuilding grand-scale information systems.andM;Giammo came to Commerce from the General Accounting Office in 1988 to get APsback on track.andP;  He describes himself as &quot;nearly obsessed&quot; with building thesystem to work well into the next century.andM;&quot;You take that kind of perspective and you build things differently,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;I don't want to create another Social Security-type system.&quot;andM;Giammo predicted that APS essentially will be complete by 2002.andP;  &quot;We willstill be doing major evolutionary development until 2002,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;What weenvision beyond 2002 is a maintenance level where we will be perfecting andrefreshing the system with small changes.&quot;andM;Giammo is keeping one eye on the Japanese, who are developing their owncomputerized patent system.andP;  Originally they had planned it for mainframes,but they are looking to convert to a distributed system, Giammo said, because&quot;they can't find a big enough mainframe.&quot;andM;Although PTO officials seem happy with the APS architecture, they still arere-evaluating and fine-tuning the entire design.andP;  &quot;We want to make sure thereisn't anything that would give us problems when we are fully deployed,&quot;Giammo said.andM;Troubles with the high-resolution terminals patent examiners will use toretrieve and display patent text and optical-disk images have been solved, hesaid.andM;The APS software itself has five major modules for text retrieval, imageretrieval, patent classification, sales of patent information, andadministrative and management functions.andP;  Only the text module is complete.andO;It lets patent examiners conduct full-text searches on more than 1 millionpatents issued since 1975.andM;Integrated with the text system is the Classified Search, Image Retrieval(CSIR) system.andP;  It stores digitized images of nearly 5 million United Statespatents on Sony Corp. optical jukeboxes controlled by Sun Microsystems Inc.andO;workstations.andM;About 50 patent examiners now use the CSIR system.andP;  Another 115 examinerswill be using it this fall.andM;By 1995, APS will have 600 terminals, or about one terminal for every threeexaminers.andP;  Because PTO will install the terminals faster than originallyplanned, Giammo said he has opted for a &quot;casino mode&quot; with all examinerssharing central facilities instead of putting examiner groups in separateterminal rooms.andM;Also in the plan are several hundred terminals for public search rooms whereinventors and patent lawyers can search the patent information.andM;&quot;We can see the end of the tunnel for CSIR, so it's time to get on with theother systems,&quot; Giammo said.andM;Smaller modules include the Classification Data System (CDS), which willinterface with APS to classify the patents.andP;  Giammo said CDS will be finishedby 1993.andM;Another is the sales module, which will replace a microfiche system thatmakes copies of patents today.andP;  PTO may add facsimile and downloadingcapabilities so the public can obtain the patents as text and300-dot-per-inch images.andM;The last module, the Patent Application Management (PAM) system, will providemicro-based administrative support for patent applications and correspondencewith inventors.andM;Giammo said a request for proposals for as many as 4,000 386 or 486microcomputers for PAM will go out early next year, with an award by the endof 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
