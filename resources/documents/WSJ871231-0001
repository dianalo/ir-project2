Currency dealers predicted the market merely will go through the motions of trading in today's last session of 1987. But they expect a rapid return to full-scale activity Monday, with traders poised to sell dollars and test the central banks' determination to continue supporting the U.S. currency's value.    Yesterday's intervention was the third consecutive day the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the West German Bundesbank had been reported buying dollars in the market. Traders said the three were joined during European trading by the central banks of France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and Austria.    Only the Swiss central bank announced its action; the others declined to confirm or deny reports of their activities.    The scale of the intervention remained relatively modest and appeared aimed only at keeping the dollar steady in the thin market. Earl I. Johnson, vice president, Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said the total of all the banks' dollar purchases was probably less than $500 million in a market of $100 billion or more. A European bank official estimated that the Bundesbank bought $200 million to $250 million, the Fed bought $100 million to $150 million, and the others intervened in token quantities.    In Palm Springs, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the dollar &quot;seems to have stabilized&quot; and that the Reagan administration continues to favor a stable exchange rate for the currency. The remark had no discernible effect on trading.    But many dealers appeared impressed by the persistence that major central banks have shown this week in halting the latest dollar decline that began over the Christmas holiday weekend. The dollar's levels throughout yesterday were barely changed from those of the previous two days. That marked an abrupt halt to its holiday weekend slide of 1.4% against the West German mark and 1.7% against the Japanese yen.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 123.25 yen, its intraday low, compared with 123.48 late Tuesday. It also was quoted at 1.5945 marks, barely moved from 1.5947 a day earlier. The British pound eased to $1.8595 from $1.8605.    The dollar in early Tokyo trading Thursday reached a record postwar low of 122.85 yen, down from its opening of 123.30, and lower than 123.33 at the close of Tokyo trading Wednesday. The Bank of Japan was reported by dealers to have intervened at the outset of trading, buying an estimated $200 million. But one dealer said the dollar continued to fall despite the intervention because &quot;market selling pressure was too sustained.&quot; Dealers said heavy selling pressure came from major trading houses and speculators.    Although the task of stabilizing the dollar was made easier by this week's thin market, traders said the central banks' presence the past three days appeared to be meant as a sign that they will remain ready to step in after New Year's Day, too.    &quot;I can't see why the Fed would be wasting all this money&quot; on intervention if it didn't intend to follow up when normal levels of liquidity return to the markets after the holidays, Robert Cassidy, vice president, Chemical Bank, New York, said.    The central banks' activities this week, though modest in dollar amounts, have at least &quot;introduced the risk of an upward move&quot; for traders or speculators inclined to bet against the dollar, he said.    Ian M. Spence, chief foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said although most central banks didn't disclose their actions, they haven't attempted to disguise their presence in the market and thereby indirectly &quot;have given it a lot more press than they ordinarily would.&quot; This helped magnify the effect of their intervention, he said, and indicates &quot;they'll still be in at least through Monday.&quot;    After that, he and other traders said, the governments' bankers may find themselves forced to acknowledge the strength of the bearish sentiment on the U.S. currency and concentrate on keeping its decline orderly.    &quot;There will be a testing immediately&quot; in the new year, according to Robert Hatcher, vice president in New York for Britain's Barclays Bank PLC. &quot;If the (negative) sentiment is as strong as I perceive, central banks will have to back off and let the rate drift down.&quot;    A major reason, he said, is that &quot;politics will be paramount&quot; in the U.S. during the coming election year, pushing economic policy considerations aside.    In addition, Mr. Hatcher said, there are signs that consumer spending is weakening in the U.S., which would mean growth would have to be led by the manufacturing sector.    &quot;To keep them happy,&quot; he said, &quot;you'll need low real interest rates and a weak dollar to aid exports.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $3.40 an ounce to $482.70 in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $484.75 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---              LATE NEW YORK TRADING             Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
