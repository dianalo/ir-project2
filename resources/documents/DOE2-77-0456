We observe thatthe suppression of the mass of the neutrino in the presence of a finitemagnetic moment may be a consequence of an SU(2) symmetry between theneutrino and the antineutrino. We discuss a model with SU(4) symmetryin the lepton sector in which the magnetic moment of the neutrino arisesas the result of charged scalars that belong to an SU(4) sextet, andthe mass of the neutrino arises at the two-loop level as the result ofelectroweak radiative corrections. For a natural explanation of a neutrinomass in the range 10--30 eV the charged scalars should have masses ofseveral tens of GeV. Thus, they can be searched for at the new e{sup+}e{sup -} colliders.</TEXT></DOC>
