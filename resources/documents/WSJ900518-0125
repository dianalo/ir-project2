In the past, the U.S. has primarily sought specificopenings for U.S. banks and securities firms into Japan'sfinancial markets on a case-by-case basis. But this timearound, the U.S. is seeking broad deregulation of depositrates, widespread direct dealings in the currency markets andgreater opportunity for foreign financial institutions tomanage Japanese cash.</LP><TEXT>   Washington's wider approach may have the potential for bigpayoffs to U.S. financial institutions, but there is alsogreater risk of the U.S.-Japanese negotiations getting boggeddown in special-interest politics in Tokyo.   The U.S. negotiating team will be headed by David Mulford,the Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs,while Japan's delegation will be headed by Makoto Utsumi, theFinance Ministry's vice minister for international affairs.The talks are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday; informaldiscussions have been going on for some time.   Washington's latest demands are viewed as threats byJapan's smaller banks, its intimate network of money dealersand its investment management industry. These institutionshave many allies in parliament, the Bank of Japan and theFinance Ministry.   &quot;Japanese small- and medium-sized financial institutionsare strongly opposed to quick deregulation of interestrates,&quot; says a bank regulator at the Finance Ministry, notingthat many feel they'll be unable to compete.   He says the smaller Japanese banks &quot;are very much afraidthat they will follow the path of U.S. savings and loaninstitutions,&quot; many of which have collapsed in recent months.   Then there is the question of how Japan's government-runpostal savings system would set rates if they wereaggressively deregulated, officials say.   If the system chose to compete with the big banks byjacking up rates, the move would hurt smaller financialinstitutions, especially those outside the cities. If thesystem set its rates lower, as the less competitive marketsoutside the big cities allow, then it would lose market sharein urban centers to big banks.   Furthermore, the prospect of higher yields in the postalsavings system isn't comforting to the government. If thepostal savings system has to pay higher yields, itconceivably would have to collect more from its investments,including the money it lends to the government.   The potential cost to Japan's government of higher yieldsin the postal savings system is just one example of the riskof deregulating interest rates. Rising yields throughout thefinancial system would threaten to push up the government'scost of borrowing.   Even though there is talk of a three-year timetable toallow Japanese institutions to adapt to broad deregulation ofinterest rates, that may not be long enough given the numberof Japanese institutions affected and the wariness ofregulators.   In addition, the alarm of Japanese regulators about theimpact of futures and program trading on the stock marketmakes them leery of aggressively pursuing another foreigninitiative. Stock-index futures were lobbied for by U.S. andother foreign firms and governments, and foreign companies sofar have dominated use of the instrument.</TEXT></DOC>
