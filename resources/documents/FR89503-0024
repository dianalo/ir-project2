Wepublished a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrativereview on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 27036). The Department has now conductedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). At the same time, on October 10, 1988,Occidental Chemical Corporation, the petitioner, informed the Departmentthat it is no longer interested in the finding and stated its support ofrevocation of the finding. Under section 751(b) and (c) of the Tariff Act,the Department may revoke an antidumping finding that is no longer of interestto domestic interested parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments of unsupported, flexible,calendered polyvinyl choloride (``PVC'') sheet, film and strips, over 6inches in width and over 18 inches in length and at least 0.0002 inch butnot over 0.020 inch in thickness. During the review period, such merchandisewas classifiable under item 771.4312 of the Tariff Schedules of the UnitedStated Annotated. This merchandise is currently classifiable under HTSitem 3920.42.50. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review coversone exporter of Taiwan PVC sheet and film to the United States and theperiod June 1, 1986 through May 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>In calculating the United States price the Department used purchase price,as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act. Purchase price was based onthe f.o.b. packed price to an unrelated purchaser in the United States.We made adjustments, where applicable, for foreign inland freight and foreignimport duty drawback. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>Incalculating foreign market value the Department used home market price,as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, since there were sufficienthome market sales of such or similar merchandise to provide a basis forcomparison. Home market price was based on the packed price to unrelatedpurchaser with adjustments, where applicable, for inland freight and differencesin credit and packing costs. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="85">Preliminary Results of the Review, Tentative Determination To Revokeand Termination of Section 751(a) Administrative Review  </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that no dumping marginsexist for Orchard Corp., Taiwan, for the period June 1, 1986 through May31, 1987. We also determine that the petitioner's affirmative statement of no interestin continuation of the antidumping finding on PVC sheet and film from Taiwanprovides a reasonable basis for terminating the current section 751(a)administrative review and initiating a section 751(b) ``changed circumstances''review to revoke the finding. Therefore, we hereby terminate the current section 751(a) administrativereview and tentatively determine to revoke the finding on PVC sheet andfilm from Taiwan effective June 1, 1987. The current requirement for acash deposit of estimated antidumping duties will continue until publicationof the final results of this review. If the Department issues a final determination of revocation, no futurecash deposit shall be required. We then intend to instruct the CustomsService to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of thismerchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on orafter June 1, 1987, without regard to antidumping duties and to refundany estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries.In the context of the changed circumstances review the Department willcomplete its administrative review.
