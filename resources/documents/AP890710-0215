He's also capable of poking fun at the Cold War with ``Lawyers inLove,'' performing a spirited cover of the golden oldie ``Stay'' orbringing audiences to their feet with ``Running on Empty.''   But rather than telling tales of '57 Chevys and teen angels,Browne prefers prayers for pretenders and demands for peace andjustice.   ``Sometimes offering a prayer is a way of focusing your hopes andaspirations and appealing to forces outside of yourself,'' the40-year-old musician said. ``That's what some of these songs are attimes.''   In the 1970s, Browne was part of a new wave of artists emergingfrom California that included the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, BonnieRaitt and Warren Zevon. But he's transformed from asinger-songwriter of the ``me'' generation to political activist,openly embracing civil rights, anti-apartheid forces in South Africaand the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.   ``I have more interests now,'' said Browne, who lives withactress Daryl Hannah. ``I don't know if that's a function of aging,or that many of the other issues in my life are settled, or on theway to being settled.   ``I was beginning to hear about Central America. Working in the'70s on ecological and environmental issues, you come face to facewith government duplicity.''   He began reading, attending lectures and traveling. Politicalcommitment has dominated his last two records, ``Lives in theBalance'' and ``World in Motion.''   Browne combines folk, hard rock and reggae with attacks onPresident Reagan, and tributes to the people of Central America andSouth Africa.   ``Most music has a political context,'' Browne said, ``whetherit's on the surface or not, whether people recognize it as such. Inthe United States, there's an old quote, `If you got a message, tryWestern Union.' I don't think it's true in Latin America where thepolitical songs are very powerful.''   But despite his passion for the rights of all people, hisaudience remains predominantly white. He cited style as a majorproblem.   ``It could depend whether or not you're speaking in the samelanguage,'' Browne said. ``If you want to find a form of music thatis talking about a lot of the same things, but to that audience,it's rap. There's real political music going on in the UnitedStates: Public Enemy, KRS-One _ hundreds and hundreds of bandsdescribing life as it is.''   On ``World in Motion,'' he covers ``My Personal Revenge,'' a songco-written by Tomas Borge, the Nicaraguan Minister of the Interior.Browne heard a tape of the song while driving outside of Managua andwas impressed by its message of forgiveness.   ``Borge had been tortured by the National Guard. As he left theprison he was tortured in, he said he would be back for his revenge.Three or four years later, after the Sandinista revolution (in1979), he found himself looking through the prisoners for this manwho had tortured him,'' Browne said.   ``He found himself amongst a bunch of people who had been workingin the very same prison. He found the man who had tortured him, toldhim he would now take his revenge and began reading the poem.''   The world seemed much simpler for Browne when he released hisdebut album, ``Saturate Before Using,'' in 1972. He was just anotherunknown young songwriter, hoping his throughtful lyrics and sparearrangements would attract attention.   ``It wasn't so much a busines then,'' Brown recalled. ``As Iwrote my early songs, I was aware of not being able to tell whethersomebody would like it. I remember thinking, `Wouldn't it be greatif people might want to hear my songs, come to a club and see meplay?'''   His appeal widened in 1976 with ``The Pretender.'' Whilerecording the album, his wife committed suicide and Browne pouredhis heart into the title track, ``The Fuse,'' and ``Here Come ThoseTears Again.''   ``There are songs I think were too introspective,'' Browne said.   ``At first, I always used a narrative form. Like `Song for Adam,'it's more or less true what I was saying. I was trying to connectwhat happened to him with my own life.   ``That was on my first record, but by the time of my fourthrecord, people begin reading about your life in Rolling Stone and itbecomes difficult to use the narrative form. It stops being aboutanybody's life and starts being about your life.''   He loosened up for the live ``Running on Empty,'' and was stunnedwhen the record went platinum.   ``It was not my best work,'' he said. ``It wasn't as serious analbum as `Late for the Sky' and `The Pretender.' It was a suspensionof values, a break from what I'd been talking about. It justdecribes a certain kind of life. There's very little of the depth ofthe previous records.''   Browne remains inspired by the protest music of the '60s andtries to write in the same spirit.   ``Rock 'n' roll is supposed to be rebellious. So much of what isconsidered rebellious today is so patented, tried and true. Heavymetal acts are not rebellion, it's rebellion against a very, verytame picture of order,'' he said.   ``Some songs from the '60s, like `Mr. Tambourine Man,' impliedfreedom and values that were present in rock 'n roll. You couldn'tfind it in the straight culture. I would accept that definition ofmy music as subversive.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, July 21-23</NOTE></DOC>
