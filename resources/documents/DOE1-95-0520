<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0520 </DOCNO><TEXT>The H{sub {alpha}} monitor system installed on TEXTOR in conjunction withthe Advanced Limiter Test-II (ALT-II) toroidal belt pump limiter is introduced.The monitors are used to study edge particle fluxes and recycling, correlationsto confinement properties of core and edge plasma with ALT-II, and alsohigh-power auxiliary heating ({approximately}5 MW) during long-pulse({approximately}4-s) operation of TEXTOR. A model of the edge particleflux based on the H{sub {alpha}} measurements is presented. The ALT-IIexperiments are to be carried out in various phases. Here we discussthe results obtained from the monitor system during the initial phaseof operations following the installation of the ALT-II limiter, withohmic heating only. 15 refs., 21 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
