The Dragon was designed to provide the&quot;common&quot; foot soldier the ability to engage medium armoredtargets effectively at medium ranges, with something he couldcarry on his back (or for that matter jump out of planeswith). Destroying Warsaw Pact Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) at1.86 miles was never the objective. To one who has spent fouryears in the 82d Airborne Division maintaining Dragons(including jumping out of C-130s carrying them), and threeyears in Saudi Arabia performing Dragon maintenance andgunnery training for the Saudi Arabian Army Southern AreaCommand, it has been obvious that mission has been fulfilled.   While it is true that the Dragon does not have the &quot;punch&quot;or the range of the Tube Launched, Optically Tracked, WireGuided Missile System (TOW), neither does it have TOW's bulkor complexity. The complete Dragon guidance and controlsystem is contained in an optical sight package that can beheld in one hand.</LP><TEXT>   The Dragon effectively and economically performs thefunction for which it was designed, made and purchased.
