 For that kind of job, youneed a serious translation engine.andM;White Crane Systems' AutoImport 1.10 makes sense of the alphabet soup of fileformats.andP;  It accepts ASCII files from virtually any source and translatesthem into a variety of spreadsheet and database formats, including dBASE,Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro, and Excel.andP;  It lets you define the specific text in thefile that you want to import, and it can append data from several files ontoa single target file.andP;  Best of all, it can automate the entire process.andM;If you need to incorporate data from the boss's weekly e-mail memo into your1-2-3 worksheet, you no longer have to edit the data to differentiate numericvariables from dates, titles, and percents.andP;  Nor do you need to alert theprogram to printer strings and editing marks, such as &quot;$&quot; and &quot;+,&quot; which havemeanings specific to 1-2-3.andP;  AutoImport makes these changes for you so youcan spend your time concentrating on formatting considerations that reallymatter, such as how to divide your data into columns and rows (Lotus's importfeature would dump the entire file into a single column).andM;You automate the process with templates, or &quot;masks,&quot; that define which datayou want to translate and how you want to treat it.andP;  From the program's bootscreen, select the Mask menu, the command structure of which is modeledloosely on 1-2-3's, then call up your file.andP;  The program lets you downloadASCII data from any disk or network, as well as from mainframes andminicomputers if you're using a terminal emulation package.andM;Some files don't easily lend themselves to ASCII conversions, but you canrefashion them into ASCII by printing the files to disk.andP;  If the applicationdoesn't allow that, use AutoImport's Print Interceptor, a canny TSR utilitythat captures and converts data en route to your printer port.andP;  You caninvoke it by hitting PrintScrn.andM;The Mask menu lets you define elements within the file, such as headers andtitles, so that they translate to the target application already in theirproper forms.andP;  This preliminary selection pays off during repetitivetranslation tasks because the masks can be saved and reused.andP;  If you downloadthe same cluster of numbers from your accounting package to your spreadsheeteach week, for example, you need to define these elements only once.andO;AutoImport manages them thereafter.andM;Batch TranslationandM;You can run translations from the DOS prompt, using the program's simple andelegant command-line syntax--which includes only seven parameters, eachseparated by a comma.andP;  Or you can write batch files that do the jobautomatically.andP;  This is particularly handy if you regularly shuffle aspecific set of data.andP;  For instance, if you keep a client list in a dBASE IVfile and must download a set of fields each week to a 1-2-3 spreadsheet, thebatch file below handles the entire operation.andM;Using AutoImport, create a translation mask that selects the records you wantto import and specifies how you want the data treated.andP;  Save the mask under afilename (we used UPDATE).andP;  Then invoke the following batch file, which wecall CLIENT.BAT:andM;CD\AI AIU D \DB\CLIENT.DBF AI UPDATE CD\123 123andM;This batch file moves you to the AutoImport directory (CD/AI), then invokesAutoImport's utility (AIU) for translating the dBASE IV client list(CLIENT.DBF) into a format that AutoImport can use.andP;  The third line invokesthe translation engine and calls up your mask (UPDATE).andP;  When the programcompletes the translation it takes you directly into 1-2-3, where you'll findyour data in the columns and rows defined in the mask.andP;  No reformatting ormopping up is required.andM;Take That, MISandM;If you depend heavily on a routine set of raw data from a mainframe orminicomputer but want to massage and analyze that data with more civilizedPC-based tools, you'll want to automate your translations accordingly.andP;  Iftransporting files is central to your day-to-day work, consider takingautomation a step further by dropping the appropriate AutoImport commandsinto your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  In fact, AutoImport might become your mostimportant tool for circumventing the backlog in your MIS department.andM;Of course, most import/export jobs aren't routine.andP;  AutoImport lets you workentirely from menus for jobs as simple as converting a single WordPerfectmail-merge list to a dBASE file, or as complex as extracting 17 columns froma 62-page mainframe-generated report for your Quattro worksheet.andP;  Theinterface is easy to navigate but somewhat unrefined; menu options such asPage-Ejects, Mode Skip, and Global Transpose should have names that users canunderstand at a glance.andP;  But overall, the program is easy to learn and muchmore efficient than the translation thatures that are resident in softwareapplications.andM;The manual, however, runs roughshod over the very features that makeAutoImport a gem of a program.andP;  The documentation should offer far moreexplanation about running the program and its utilities from the DOS prompt.andM;As promised in the literature, translation is fast.andP;  When it finishes, theprogram displays a self-aggrandizing tally of how much time it saved you fromrekeying the data.andP;  The price of this speed and friendliness is memory: theprogram requires a whopping 442K.andP;  Expect it to bump elbows with your TSRs.andO;You can, however, lop 100K off total memory requirements by changing asetting to reduce the size of files that your masks can accommodate.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
