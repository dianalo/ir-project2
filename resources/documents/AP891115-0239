BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Disappointing sales and earnings growth isthreatening to put Southland Corp. in violation of its creditagreements, forcing the parent of the 7-Eleven chain to consider arestructuring less than two years after a $4.9 billion leveragedbuyout.   The Dallas-based company said Tuesday that current projectionsindicate it will not be able to meet its debt payment obligationsin 1991, despite better-than-industry-average increases in averagestore sales.   Financial analysts for months have been expressing concern thatSouthland faced problems with its huge debt, although the companyuntil now maintained it could meet its obligations. But Southlandsaid sales projections at its 7-Eleven convenience store chain, thenation's largest, had not been met.   Although President Jere Thompson said Southland would meet its$225 million principal payment due next month, ``given theconvenience retailing environment, Southland believes its workingcapital may not be sufficient in 1991 to meet its principal andinterest obligations and other requirements of the business.''   ``We are absolutely committed to improving our operatingresults,'' said Thompson, a member of the founding family thatbought the company to avoid corporate raider Sam Belzberg.   ``In addition, we feel it is only prudent to consider financialrestructuring alternatives well in advance of the time this cashshortfall could occur.''   He said one alternative might be a comprehensiverecapitalization. In a recapitalization, a company alters itslevels of debt and equity.   The company has been selling assets since the leveraged buyoutto help pay off its debt, and announced Tuesday an agreement tosell its 58 Hawaiian stores to Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. for $75million cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.   Last week, Southland said it agreed to sell its remaining 50percent interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp. to Venezuela'sstate-owned oil company for $675 million. The sale should becompleted by the end of January, the company said.   Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce the LBOdebt, the company said.   Thompson said the company also continues to explore sellingother assets, including its five distribution centers and six foodprocessing centers.   ``The last public projections we had were October 1988, and theoperating numbers that we were projecting have not materialized,''said company spokeswoman Markeeta McNatt. ``Our sales and marginsare still extremely good, but they have not met our ownprojections.''   The company projected inflation-adjusted sales growth of 2percent. However Ms. McNatt said, inflation had been higher thananticipated and real growth amounted to only less than 1 percentduring the first nine months of this year.   ``The summer was disappointing for the entire convenience storeindustry. It was a cold, wet summer for most of the country,especially our major markets,'' Ms. McNatt said.   Despite the softness and competition from convenience storesoperated by oil companies, Ms. McNatt said Southland's averagestore sales are continuing at 1988's strong levels, when theyincreased 4.6 percent, compared with an industry average of a 2.1percent decline.   Also Tuesday, Southland reported a third-quarter loss of $63.37million, compared with $46.8 million in the same quarter last year.Revenue rose to $2.23 billion from $2.18 billion.   For the first nine months of this year, it lost $243.76 million,compared with a loss of $179.2 million in the year-earlier period.The loss this year included a $56 million charge from exchange ofdebt. Nine-month revenue rose to $6.29 billion from $6.02 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
