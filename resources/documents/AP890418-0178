A doctor who treated victims of the April 9 clashes, in which atleast 19 people died, told a meeting of the Georgian Academy ofSciences Friday that troops used poison gas when they dispersed thedemonstration in front of the central government building. Avideotape of the meeting was shown to journalists in Moscow Tuesdaynight.   A midnight to 5 a.m. curfew was lifted Tuesday morning, and thestaged withdrawal of troops began, Tass said.   ``Tanks and armored personnel carriers have vanished from citystreets, and armed patrols are no longer in sight,'' the newsagency said. ``They have been replaced by volunteers acting inclose contact with the police force.''   The evening newspaper Izvestia said the streets of Tbilisi werebeing patrolled by 4,000 volunteer workers and 750 policemen.``They took upon themselves the responsibility for securing orderin the city,'' it said.   Troops and tanks moved into Tbilisi on April 7 after three daysof pro-independence rallies. Early on the morning of April 9,soldiers moved to clear the downtown of demonstrators in the deadlyclash, and authorities imposed a curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a former firstsecretary of the Georgian Communist Party, who has been in Tbilisinine days in a personal attempt to restore calm, left on Tuesday,according to Soviet television. Fellow Politburo member Georgy P.Razumovsky accompanied Shevardnadze back to Moscow.   At Friday's meeting of the Academy of Sciences, Shevardnadzesaid he had met with nationalist leaders, workers and factorybosses. He promised that if they could keep the city calm and makesure workers showed up Monday morning, he would have the troopswithdrawn and the curfew lifted.   The videotape showed Shevardnadze listening passively as about adozen members of the academy lambasted the local government for theway it handled the demonstration. They charged that soldiers usedspades to brutally beat protesters, and chased them for blocksafter they were dispersed.   Vakhtan Petriya, a physician who initially treated victims ofthe clashes, said, ``Three persons taken in were poisoned byaerosols.''   He said soldiers used a nerve gas contained in canisters andaerosol containers. ``We were at a loss on how to treat them,'' hesaid. ``I don't know the compound used in the gas.'' Shevardnadzedid not respond.   Another member of the academy, who did not identify himself whenhe spoke, directed his remarks directly to Shevardnadze. ``Theyactually hurt people by using sharp spades and knives,'' he said.``I would like to tell you about that bluntly, Eduard.''   One speaker described how soldiers, after dispersing theprotesters, chased a young girl for several blocks, then up twoflights of stairs in the Intourist Hotel, where she was beaten.   Other speakers accused the government of attempting to use themedia to cover up the actions of soldiers during the clashes. ``Ourmass media, especially television, produced programs that wereincompetent,'' said a teacher of literature at Tbilisi University,who did not give his name.   ``A half-truth is worse than a falsehood,'' he said. ``Thiscauses speculation. This is a knife in the back of perestroika anddemocratization.''   When Shevardnadze addressed the academy, he made no attempt torebut the allegations of brutality and use of gas to disperse theprotesters, charges made last week by residents in telephoneinterviews with Western reporters.   Instead, he urged Georgians not to let the events of April 9stand in the way of restructuring the country. He said they should``develop perestroika without bloodshed and barricades.''   In response to a question from the audience, he said the orderto deploy troops against the demonstrators came from the localCommunist Party leadership and not from President Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   ``If that was true, I would not be standing before you now,'' hesaid, adding that he was sent to Georgia by Gorbachev to calm thesituation.   Shevardnadze denied there was censorship or attempts to muzzlethe Soviet press in covering the 10 days of military patrols andcurfew. Foreign journalists have been barred from traveling toTbilisi and the Soviet national press has offered littleinformation on the clash itself.</TEXT></DOC>
