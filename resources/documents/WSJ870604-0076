Since last year's summit in Tokyo, the U.S. has become a net debtor nation -- the world's leading debtor, in fact -- and both the budget and trade deficits have hit new records. Even though the deficits now are receding, long-term improvement is expected to be tough and slow. The president is embroiled in scandal and has lost control of the Senate. And the Democratic Congress is moving to pass the most protectionist trade bill in years, despite his veto threat.    &quot;We aren't any longer on the economic high ground,&quot; says Robert Hormats, a former Reagan administration assistant secretary of state for economic affairs. &quot;It's hard to lecture others when we haven't got our own economic act together.&quot; As a result, says Mr. Hormats, now a vice president of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., &quot;I think the president's ability to accomplish his goals at the summit is very limited.&quot;    At the summit with the leaders of Canada, France, Britain, Italy, Japan and West Germany, Mr. Reagan will seek renewed support for policies designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which was $166 billion last year, and to stabilize the dollar after its two-year decline.    Yesterday, Treasury Secretary James Baker stressed that U.S. policies won't change when Alan Greenspan succeeds Paul Volcker as the Federal Reserve Board chairman. Mr. Greenspan &quot;is firmly committed to the fight against inflation, as Paul Volcker was and as the administration is,&quot; Mr. Baker said in an ABC News interview. He added that Mr. Reagan named Mr. Greenspan after learning that Mr. Volcker didn't want a third four-year term because &quot;to leave the question of a successor hanging out there during the Venice summit would have been a mistake.&quot;    In a speech last week, Mr. Reagan said that in Venice &quot;I'll ask the leaders of the other industrial nations to stimulate their economies. We want them to buy more goods, not only from America but from throughout the world, so they can help us make prosperity world-wide.&quot;    All the leaders want to help the U.S. reduce its trade deficit without triggering a global recession, but the economic stimulus that the U.S. is seeking from the major surplus countries -- Japan and Germany -- poses tough political problems for their inflation-sensitive governments.    What's more, America's record of keeping its own economic promises to allies has been spotty at best. &quot;The president has failed to deliver the one thing that every other country wants from him -- a serious attack on his budget deficit,&quot; says C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research center.    The huge U.S. budget and trade deficits, stemming from Americans' penchant for consuming more than they are producing and then borrowing to pay the bills, have made Washington increasingly dependent on foreign credit. When Mr. Reagan looks across the summit table, he will be facing senior creditors rather than junior allies.    &quot;He's the supplicant,&quot; Mr. Bergsten says. &quot;He's the guy who's dependent on their continued financing for his economic strategy.&quot;    This dependence puts new pressures on U.S. officials and limits their flexibility. The need to keep foreign central banks and private overseas lenders financing the deficits is increasingly influencing U.S. economic policy. This spring, for instance, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in an effort to bolster foreign investment in dollar-denominated assets.    But the implications of the America's debtor status extend beyond economics. As the leader of the Western defense alliance, the U.S. may find it more and more difficult to balance military leadership with economic dependence. Already, there is growing congressional interest in the idea of withdrawing some U.S. troops from West Germany, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S. and is perceived as able to raise its own military spending.    &quot;Can the world's leading debtor also be its leading power?&quot; Mr. Hormats asks. &quot;It's a question you ask yourselves going into this summit. It's &quot;terra incognita.&quot; If you're constantly asking everyone to do things for you economically, can you lead the Free World?&quot;    Although America's weaknesses are real, the president isn't without cards to play. Problems such as the trade deficit &quot;don't change the stature that the president will have at the summit,&quot; Secretary Baker said in a recent interview. &quot;Why? Because we are still far and away the world's largest economy.&quot;    America's $4.4 trillion gross national product -- its output of goods and services -- dwarfs Japan's $2.4 trillion economy. Though economic growth shows signs of slowing, the U.S. is in the 53rd month of an economic upturn that has absorbed vast world exports and created record numbers of American jobs. &quot;In terms of the fundamentals, the U.S. economy is very strong,&quot; says Richard Cooper, a Harvard economics professor who served as President Carter's undersecretary of state for economic affairs. &quot;It's flexible, it's dynamic. It's probably in better shape than any other major economy.&quot;    At the summit, Mr. Baker says, &quot;we will be able to make a reasonably good presentation on what we've done to carry out past promises.&quot; He notes that the federal deficit this fiscal year is expected to fall to about $180 billion, down sharply from fiscal 1986's $220 billion.    In addition, officials cite tremendous progress in the past year toward economic-policy coordination. All the big industrial nations now agree that the U.S. must cut its budget and trade deficits. They also agree that the only way to achieve that without a world-wide recession is for Germany and Japan to grow faster and import more as the U.S., aided by the weaker dollar, cuts its trade deficit by reducing imports and raising exports.    Administration officials contend that the U.S. record in cutting the budget deficit, however disappointing, still tops the performance of the Germans and the Japanese on their promises to grow faster. And they say foreign complaints about the deficit are often a smokescreen by other nations to hide their own shortcomings.    What's more, other summiteering leaders have their own political problems -- some worse than the president's. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone recently had to withdraw an unpopular tax plan and is expected to leave office in October. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has just emerged from a bruising political fight over arms control. And the Japanese and German economies both have enormous structural problems, including deeply rooted agricultural subsidies that distort markets and a mercantilist export drive that will have to be modified by building domestic demand.    Mr. Reagan plans to take the rhetorical offensive in Venice. &quot;I'll tell them that we, for our part, will finish putting our own house in order,&quot; he said in his recent speech. &quot;I will tell them that I will spend this summer and fall going to cities and towns across America. I will be asking the American people to help us keep the deficit spenders in Congress from wrecking America's economic future.&quot;    But the U.S. budget-deficit problem is real. Next year's deficit reduction is expected to be only about half this year's cut, unless pending budget negotiations produce a breakthrough. The balanced budget required by the landmark Gramm-Rudman law for fiscal 1991 seems out of reach. And the president still resists any form of tax increase to reduce the red ink, a move that the other nations advocate.    Chancellor Kohl says he plans to ask U.S. officials at Venice &quot;how they plan to make progress in fulfilling their obligations . . . in particular, reduction of the U.S. budget deficit.&quot; A German economic official adds, &quot;For the credibility of the U.S., it is absolutely essential that you come to agreement on bigger cuts in the budget deficit, on the order of $40 billion a year, with tax increases included.&quot;    A senior administration official, while expressing confidence in the U.S. economy as a whole, says, &quot;A lot of people at Venice are going to be asking the president, 'Is Gramm-Rudman for real?' And he's not going to be able to say yea or nay. He could be very much on the defensive at the summit,&quot; this official adds, &quot;because we haven't made the one big macroeconomic contribution&quot; that the U.S. promised -- major deficit cuts.    And the trade deficit, while likely to narrow now that the dollar has fallen, would have to turn into a big surplus over the next decade -- at other nations' expense -- to generate the income needed by the U.S. to service its mounting foreign debt. Mr. Bergsten estimates that the U.S. will need a $200 billion annual turnaround in trade during the 1990s to wipe out the trade deficit and service its foreign debt. This would require a trade surplus running as high as $50 billion a year. But how export-driven Europe and Japan or debt-plagued developing nations would do all that buying from America isn't clear.    Sen. Lloyd Bensten, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, says, &quot;We can't hide our embarrassing emergence as the greatest debtor nation in the history of mankind. Who would have imagined that by the end of this decade, America will owe three-quarters of a trillion dollars to our creditors abroad? Our situation reminds me of the T-shirt slogan that says: 'I can't be broke. I've still got checks.'&quot;    Adding to the administration's problems, its two main policy tools for dealing with international economic problems have both been weakened. Mr. Baker's successful effort to drive down the dollar has been halted after producing roughly a 50% decline. The markets may still push it down further, but Mr. Baker, worried about an erosion of confidence in the dollar, has had to stop encouraging them. Thus, he has lost a tool for pressuring other nations.    And the Treasury chief's plan for easing Third World debt burdens by trading new loans for debtors' economic reforms has been thrown into doubt because big U.S. banks, by increasing their loan-loss reserves, are raising questions about their willingness to lend new money. Nevertheless, the summit communique is expected to reaffirm support for the Baker plan.    Japan has promised to help a bit by increasing its Third World lending by $30 billion. In addition, the Nakasone government has promised a $43 billion domestic-stimulus package that appears to meet its pledges to the U.S. And even Germany, which has stubbornly resisted U.S. pressure to stimulate its economy, has begun slightly paring its interest rates and has promised to consider accelerated fiscal stimulus if its growth lags.    These moves may prove to be less than meets the eye, but they give Prime Minister Nakasone and Chancellor Kohl at least a talking point at the summit. In any event, the relationship between the U.S. and its allies has subtly changed. &quot;We've gotten ourselves into a position where we want them to do things, but we owe them,&quot; a senior U.S. official says. &quot;The debtor country, the deficit country, has got all the pressure on it.&quot;    Germany and Japan, while often smug about their trade prowess, are uncomfortable with Washington's predicament. One Japanese government analyst, insisting on anonymity, says the current U.S. bind is more worrisome than earlier trade problems. &quot;The major difference now,&quot; he says, &quot;is that the size of the debt of the U.S. has grown so much. . . . The key currency nation is now a debtor nation. It is a concept we have never seen before, and we are uneasy with it.&quot;    Both countries insist that they aren't ready to take over global economic leadership. &quot;The U.S. cannot be replaced in the economic field as the leader in the world,&quot; a German government analyst says. Among the reasons for their reluctance: their much smaller economies, the burdens of acting as growth &quot;locomotives,&quot; and even hangovers from World War II, which have left their neighbors and themselves wary of seeming to dominate others.    Mr. Hormats agrees. &quot;We have gone from an American hegemony to a need for plural leadership of the system. In effect, the power has shifted, but the responsibility hasn't. These countries have enormous economic power,&quot; he says, but &quot;they continue to look to us as the fixer of the system.&quot;    And can the U.S. shoulder the twin burdens of debt and defense of its allies? The National Journal says members of Congress are deluging the Library of Congress with requests for information on the implications of U.S. troop reductions in Europe. It is harder and harder for U.S. politicians to justify keeping 250,000 troops in Germany and 50,000 in Japan while the U.S. runs trade deficits with those countries.    &quot;National security involves economic security, too,&quot; Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, says. &quot;We Americans will project force and strength better overseas when we're stronger economically.&quot;    Such sentiments are likely to grow as Mr. Reagan moves to use the U.S. Navy to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, even though Mideast oil is much more important to Europe and Japan than to the U.S. The summit participants probably will express support for the president's view that free navigation must be preserved in the gulf. But whether they will endorse U.S. military steps to protect shipping isn't known, and military assistance from the allies seems highly unlikely.    Nevertheless, Mr. Reagan will stress the need for sharing the burdens of defense as well as economic adjustment. &quot;While our country is still looked to for leadership,&quot; he explained in a speech Monday, &quot;the Free World is now undeniably a partnership among democracies.&quot;    ---           The Reagan Years, in the U.S. and Abroad         How the major industrial nations have fared          U.S.  JAPAN  GERMANY  U.K.  FRANCE  ITALY  CANADA Real Growth (Annual percentage change) 1980     -.2%   4.3%   1.5%   -2.5%    1.1%   3.9%   1.5% 1986     2.5    2.5    2.4     2.5     2.2    2.8    3.1 Consumer prices (Annual percentage change) 1980    13.5%   7.7%   5.4%   18.0%   13.3%  21.2%  10.2% 1986     1.9    0.6   -0.3     3.4     2.2    5.9    4.2 Balance of payments (In billions of U.S. dollars on a                       current-account basis) 1980    $1.9  $-10.7  $-15.7  $-6.8   $-4.2  $-9.7  $-1.0 1986  -140.6    86.0    36.0   -1.6     3.7    4.7   -6.3 Unemployment (Annual percentage change) 1980     7.2%   2.0%   3.4%    6.5%    6.6%   7.6%   7.4% 1986     7.0    2.8    7.9    11.6    10.7   11.1    9.6 Government deficit (As percentage of GNP) 1980     2.3%   6.2%   1.6%    2.5%    1.1%  10.8%   3.4% 1986     5.0    4.3    0.7     2.6     2.9   14.2    4.9</TEXT></DOC>
