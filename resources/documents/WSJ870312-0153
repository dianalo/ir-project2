Terms weren't disclosed.    The move completes a previously announced restructuring and will effectively take Moore McCormack out of the metals business. Moore McCormack previously agreed to sell its shipping line and has shed its iron-ore and coal units, leaving it primarily a building-materials and oil and gas concern.    &quot;Once this sale is done, a major shift in the company's focus will be completed,&quot; a spokesman said.    The sale is expected to be completed by mid-April, subject to approval by both companies' boards and other conditions. Cyprus Minerals mines coal, industrial minerals and metals. A Moore McCormack spokesman said the depressed state of the metals industry contributed to the decision to sell the unit.    In 1985, Globe had pre-tax operating profit of $4 million on revenue of $89.2 million, representing 15.3% of Moore McCormack's sales. The company wouldn't disclose the unit's 1986 results, but a spokesman said its revenue last year was lower than in 1985.    The spokesman said Moore McCormack doesn't expect to show a gain from the sale but that it won't need additional writedowns. Last June, the company reported a write-down of $89.9 million from sales of discontinued operations.    The restructuring &quot;will improve our financial flexibility and allow us to focus attention on improving earnings from existing operations and pursuing growth through acquisitions in these and new areas,&quot; Paul R. Tregurtha, president and chief executive officer, said. &quot;We remain optimistic for improved results in 1987 in our construction materials and oil and gas operations,&quot; he said.    Moore McCormack had a 1986 net loss of $116.5 million on revenue of $334 million. </TEXT></DOC>
