The most frequent? Of all small businesses? Offices that sell both real estate and insurance are started more often than restaurants? Dry cleaners? Mail-order operations?    Pressed on the source of the data, an SBA spokesman says the agency used statistics from Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., the New York credit-rating firm which tracks business starts and failures in the U.S.    But a call to Dun andamp; Bradstreet finds only 12 such businesses started last year -- fewer than in almost any of the more than 100 business categories it tracks and a sharp drop-off from the 27 such businesses that started the year before.    &quot;Could you send that study to us?&quot; asks a surprised Dun andamp; Bradstreet spokeswoman, adding, &quot;I don't like it when they do this without talking to us; it makes us look bad.&quot;    Numerous calls to various SBA officials finally reveals that the agency didn't &quot;just release&quot; a study after all. Instead, an overzealous public relations official for a regional SBA office spotted the list of most frequently started businesses on the agency's &quot;answer cards&quot; -- which answer questions frequently posed to the SBA -- and thought it newsworthy.    The answer cards, it turns out, were culled from outdated 1986 data which didn't track the most frequently started businesses at all, but rather the rate of start-ups in each industry for every 10,000 firms already in that industry. And the industry classification of &quot;combined real-estate and insurance offices&quot; is actually -- in the words of one SBA official -- &quot;an et cetera category&quot; for all businesses in finance, real estate and insurance that don't fit neatly into any other category. That led to the statistical illusion that its rate of start-ups was higher than any other.    The SBA now concedes that it simply goofed on the wording of the cards and probably shouldn't have included such a nebulous category at all.    (For those wondering what the most frequently started small business really is, the answer is a restaurant). </TEXT></DOC>
