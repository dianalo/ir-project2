JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Major environmental groups accused the Bushadministration Thursday of having ``no plans, no action and no onein charge'' to deal with global warming, which many scientists saycould cause severe problems by the middle of the next century.   The criticism came amid reports that top advisers to PresidentBush were divided on how aggressively the United States should pushfor specific commitments on reducing so-called ``greenhouse''pollutants.   Eleven environmental groups at a news confernce accused thepresident of reneging on a campaign promise to tackle the globalwarming issue early in his presidency. Bush said during thecampaign that he would host an international conference on globalwarming and other environmental issues during his first year inoffice.   ``The other industrial countries are looking at the UnitedStates for leadership ... (but) we have silence from the presidentand total disarray within the administration,'' said Brooks Yeager,governmental affairs director for the Audubon Society.   ``We have great rhetoric but no leadership,'' declared DanBecker of the Sierra Club. ``There are no plans, no action, no onein charge.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we feelprogress has been made'' in confronting concerns about expectedrising world temperatures because of the enormous man-madepollutants allowed into the air.   But Fitzwater said pollution curbs should not be proposedunilaterally and the administration must consider the long-termeconomic impacts of any actions aimed at dealing with globalwarming.   ``There are economic aspects of this that cannot be ignored justblindly in the search for global warming,'' said Fitzwater.   The latest round of criticism was prompted by reports ofdisagreement within the administration on whether to send adelegation to an upcoming conference of environmental ministers inthe Netherlands.   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, said on Wednesday that he would head a delegation to theconference Nov. 6-7, but that the United States was not prepared toendorse a proposed commitment for a freeze by the year 2000 ongreenhouse gases at current levels.   The Dutch government has said it plans to propose such a freezeat the conference and environmentalists have argued even a freezeis inadequte, calling for at least a 20 percent reduction by theend of the century.   Administration sources, speaking on the condition they not benamed, acknowleged that until recent days it was not even certainthat Reilly would attend the conference.   Reilly declined to discuss reports of discord within theadministration on the global warming issue. ``The president hasmade it very clear. We recognize the global warming problem,'' hesaid, but he added ``a whole range of questions'' remain to beresolved.   Environmentalists said uncertainty within the administration hassent a signal to European leaders that the Bush administration isnot prepared to lead the effort to curb global warming pollutants,although the United States accounts for one-fifth of the world'sgreenhouse gases.   ``This is a major meeting,'' said Christopher Flavin, a globalwarming expert at the Worldwatch Institute. ``It's been in theplanning stage for the better part of a year. The United Statesjust doesn't have its act together.''   The environmental groups called for the United States to endorsea 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year2000. Such cuts would require sharp increases in automobile fuelefficiency and other energy conservation measures. Many scientistssay unless these pollutants are curbed the world will seesignificant increases in world temperatures by the middle of thenext century.   Other major environmental groups critical of the Bushadministration included the Natural Resources Defense Council,Friends of the Earth and the Environmental Defense Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
