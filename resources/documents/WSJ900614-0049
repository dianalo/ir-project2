Demand for such equipment is likely to grow because banksare under pressure to clear checks faster. New federalregulations that take effect in September will require banksto credit to the customer's account within two days virtuallyany check deposited through an ATM, and many banks haveindicated that they would have to eliminate ATM depositsbecause they wouldn't be able to meet that speed. Current lawrequires credit within seven days.</LP><TEXT>   CoreStates' new MAC Check machines, scheduled for ademonstration today to industry executives attending abanking conference at the University of Pennsylvania, areequipped with more microchips for increased scanningcapability. They can read the blocky numbers printed withmagnetic ink in the lower left corner of each check. Unlikeolder-generation machines, the new ones can identify thecheck's originating bank, the account number and check numberbefore spitting out the cash.   The new machines allow users to cash instantly all or partof a check, depositing any remainder. ATM users also would beable to buy certificates of deposit and verify their accountactivity. Separate versions of the equipment are made byInternational Business Machines Corp. and NCR Corp. The unitscost about $43,000 each.   To get started in the program, customers pre-registertheir payroll, government or dividend checks with humantellers, who can instruct the ATM network to cash up to 10%to 15% more than the typical check amount. Certainnon-recurring checks, such as a gift from a relative, mayalso be cashed by the machines, within the bank's pre-definedlimit for the customer.   Philadelphia National Bank, a unit of CoreStates, has beentesting prototypes of the new machine for about 14 months ata branch in Newtown, Pa. Customers get money quickly, 24hours a day, while bank tellers are relieved ofcheck-verification chores. CoreStates officials say newaccounts at the branch have doubled since the machine wasinstalled, and account closings have dropped 30%.   &quot;About 70% of a teller's time is spent dealing with checksfrom the consumer,&quot; says Richard W. Epps, a CoreStates vicepresident. &quot;Our experience in Newtown is that half of thosechecks have been moved from tellers to machines.&quot; As aresult, he says, the bank has been able to shift tellers toother duties.   Quicker access to the funds would be a big plus for U.S.consumers, who made an estimated 490 million deposits byusing ATMs last year. But that volume could soon dropsharply: A survey by the American Bankers Associationindicates that about 90% of commercial banks plan to stopaccepting customer deposits through ATMs, mainly because theycan't meet the new deadlines using their current equipmentwithout vulnerability to massive fraud.   Ten financial institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region,including Meridian Bancorp Inc. and Midlantic National Bank,have signed up to use the new MAC machines. They expect to beon-line by early 1991, a CoreStates spokesman says. Thosebanks are already hooked up to CoreStates's own MAC system,which is used by about 16.5 million cardholders in theNortheast.   Until now, the banking industry has given littleconsideration to what marketing features could be added topush ATM's into the next generation, Mr. Epps says.&quot;Paychecks and pension checks are the lifeline forconsumers,&quot; he says &quot;and they need the money right away.&quot;   Moreover, it has taken years for consumers to integrateATMs into their banking habits. &quot;If you had predicted thatpeople would go up to an ATM and do a transaction of a CD,you would have been laughed at,&quot; says Edward Alwood, anautomation issues specialist at the American BankersAssociation. But ATM use is accelerating &quot;as the oldergeneration ages and the younger computer generation startsbanking,&quot; he says.   The advanced machines are likely to boost CoreStatesprofits. Historically, the bank holding company has generateda large amount of its earnings, about 35%, from suchnon-lending sources as fees from debit and credit cards, saysJoel Silberstein, a bank analyst at Advest Inc. in New York.With assets of $22.2 billion after its acquisition in Marchof First Pennsylvania Corp., CoreStates &quot;clears more checksthan the Fed does itself in the Third District,&quot; says Mr.Silberstein.   A spokesman for NCR in Dayton, Ohio, says the companyexpects to install about 1,500 of the new machines in 1991and double the volume in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
