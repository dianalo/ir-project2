The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,584.98, aloss of 22.38, which erased much of Friday's nearly 32-point gain.   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide tradingof New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 942 down, 532 up and507 unchanged.   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.26 millionshares, down from 174.88 million in the previous session.   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, includingtrades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in theover-the-counter market, totaled 166.21 million shares.   The stock market headed down from the opening bell and variousmarket measures finished near their lowest levels of the sessionafter an afternoon rebound ran out of steam.   Wall Street analysts had anticipated the selloff.   Much of the force behind Friday's surge in the Dow Jonesindustrial average came from trading strategies tied to theexpiration of July stock-related futures and options.   With the conclusion of trading in those contracts, a majorbuying motivation disappeared.   ``A lot of last week's activity was predicated on the futuresand options expirations,'' said Eugene Peroni, director oftechnical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.   Attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook.Financial markets have been building up their hopes for the FederalReserve Board to make a significant move toward a more generouscredit policy but so far they have been disappointed.   ``The market must now consider that the Fed and the majorcommercial banks have not acted as aggressively as was hoped,''said Peroni.   Earlier this month when Chase Manhattan Bank cut its primelending rate to 10{ percent from 11 percent, it was widely assumedthat its competitors would follow suit. But other major banks havedemurred.   Among the stocks bucking the downtrend were Honeywell, whichclimbed 3~ to 89], a 52-week high. The company, which has beenmentioned lately as a possible takeover target, announced a majorrestructuring program that includes buying back about 10 millionshares of its common stock and selling a substantial portion of itsstake in Yamatake-Honeywell.   Warner Communications also finished on the plus side and was themost heavily traded NYSE-listed stock, as more than 4.7 millionshares changed hands. Warner rose 1| to 67[ after the DelawareSupreme Court upheld a lower court ruling allowing Time to proceedwith its $14 billion tender offer for Warner. Time fell 1 to 137{.   Paramount Communications, which dropped its $12.2 billionhostile bid for Time after the court's ruling, rose 1~ to 59].   Losers among the blue chips included McDonalds, which sank 2] to29[. Securities analysts were unimpressed by the fast-foodrestaurant company's second-quarter earnings.   Also contributing to the decline in the Dow Jones industrialaverage was Eastman Kodak, which dropped ~ to 47~. The company saidits second-quarter earnings will be reduced by about $225 milliondue to a previously announced restructuring.   Exxon lost 1|, falling to 45[. Its second-quarter income plungedmore than $1 billion due to costs associated with the Alaskan oilspill.   Among stocks mentioned recently as possible takeover candidates,Holiday Corp. jumped 3} to a 52-week high of 62{.   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000actively traded stocks, the market fell $21.52 billion, or 0.65percent, in value.   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocksdeclined 1.12 to 186.03.   Standard andamp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.93 to 382.38, andSandamp;P's 500-stock composite index finished at 333.67, off 2.23.
