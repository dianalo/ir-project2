It might even improve the chances of peace.&quot;    But Renate Marbach, a local newspaper columnist, has a different view of Mr. Honecker's long-awaited homecoming. &quot;Honecker views the division of Germany as irreversible,&quot; she says. &quot;Since coming to power, he has tightened security along our borders. The command to shoot escapees has been made into law. Even their national anthem is no longer sung because a line in the text says, 'Germany, united fatherland.'&quot;    On Monday, when the 75-year-old Mr. Honecker returns to territory he hasn't seen in 52 years, he will become the first East German leader to visit West Germany since the postwar division of Germany four decades ago. His trip -- which will include talks with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- will be a highly symbolic act that could have important political repercussions. Both countries know it could lead to closer relations between the two Germanys and, for that matter, between West Germany and the Soviets.    Yet it will also underscore the painful political division of Germany. The two German states don't have formal diplomatic ties. Moreover, West Germany, with its constitution fixing reunification as a national goal, treats the partition as temporary; East Germany sees it as permanent.    Despite all this, the two governments have embarked on a cautious dialogue. &quot;Both countries understand that a rapprochement is out of the question. We have fundamentally opposing views,&quot; says Claus Duisberg, an adviser to Mr. Kohl on inter-German relations. &quot;But we would like to explore, in practical terms, what can be done to improve the exchanges and contact between people.&quot;    Since January, for instance, &quot;sister city&quot; programs that link nine pairs of towns in the two Germanys have been arranged. And during next week's summit meeting, agreements in environmental matters, nuclear safety and the exchange of scientific research will be signed.    Where the West Germans hope to achieve the most progress, however, is in human rights. Strides have been made lately: Bonn expects a new general amnesty announced by East Berlin in July to result in the release soon of about 2,000 political prisoners, mostly people who were arrested while trying to escape. Moreover, about one million East Germans under the age of 65 will visit West Germany in 1987, almost double last year's figure and up from 40,000 five years ago.    In exchange for easing travel restrictions, East Germany hopes to gain money and technology, which it needs to retain its position as the Soviet bloc's showcase industrial economy. Mr. Honecker, at his request, will meet with Berthold Beitz, one of Germany's most prominent industrialists and the chairman of Fried. Krupp G.m.b.H., the engineering and steel concern.    East Berlin already receives credits and aid from West Germany valued at an estimated $1 billion annually. Much of that comes in the form of ransom: Bonn typically pays about 10,000 marks ($5,500) for each emigre and much more for the release of political prisoners.    The Soviet Union, too, sees potential gains from the East German party chief's visit. Although Moscow would never allow the revival of a strong, unified Germany, it is permitting Mr. Honecker's visit this time after canceling it twice before. The likely reason: to expand its influence over West German public opinion and thus gain greater leverage over Bonn.    Against this background of superpower politicking comes Mr. Honecker, the perfect pawn. The man who as chief of security presided over the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he is a Communist in the tradition of Stalin. Young Honecker started banging the drums of communism in the mid-1920s, when he played in a Wiebelskirchen band formed to play working-class protest songs.    In 1935, when he last saw his home town, which lies in southern Germany on the French border, Mr. Honecker was arrested by the Nazis. Imprisoned for 10 years, he was freed when the Soviets liberated Berlin. He has been a dedicated defender of Moscow ever since and succeeded Walter Ulbricht as head of the East German Socialist Unity Party in 1971.    Part of his wish to visit West Germany, associates say, stems from an old man's nostalgia for his childhood. The Communist leader has been known to weep in reminiscing about the past with visitors to East Berlin from his home town. In what is certain to be a moving moment, he and his sister, who still lives in Wiebelskirchen, plan to visit the family grave during his Sept. 10 stay there.    &quot;Honecker has a very great personal desire to return home,&quot; says one authority on inter-German relations. &quot;But he also wants to come back to his birthplace as leader of the other German state. He wants that recognition.&quot;    The West Germans, though, will receive him as an &quot;honored&quot; guest, not as a head of state. When his plane lands in Bonn, he won't be met by Mr. Kohl or President Richard von Weizsaecker, but by the head of the chancellor's office, Wolfgang Schaeuble. And instead of the 21 motorcycle escorts used on state visits, Mr. Honecker will get 17. </TEXT></DOC>
