The main objectives of this studywere to conduct measurements of nitric acid and selected other airbornegaseous and particulate acidifying species using different types of samplersand to compare their performance under field sampling conditions. Thispaper presents and compares results collected using the annular denudersystem (ADS) and the transition flow reactor (TFR). Ambient concentrationsof the following constituents were obtained: nitric acid, nitrous acid,nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, strong hydrogen ion, and particulatenitrate, sulfate, and ammonium. Concentration and precision results fromboth samplers are compared. Statistical analyses of selected resultsare also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
