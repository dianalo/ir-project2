The bank holding company also said it will ask holders to approve the staggered election of its board, a standard anti-takeover measure.    Chemical is the parent of Chemical Bank and Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., and is the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company.    If the name change is approved at the annual meeting, Chemical said it will go into effect immediately. The company's symbol on the New York Stock Exchange would remain CHL.    Walter V. Shipley, chairman and chief executive officer, said: &quot;The corporation's new name will better reflect the geographic diversification that results from our merger in 1987 with Texas Commerce Bancshares and the planned merger next January with Horizon Bancorp in New Jersey.&quot;    Chemical said the proposal to stagger the election of its board is designed to make it more time-consuming for a substantial stockholder to gain control of the board without its consent.    Chemical said its board isn't aware of any present effort to gain control of the company or organize a proxy contest. </TEXT></DOC>
