DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, former head of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.'s high-yield junk bond department, pleaded innocentFriday to a wide-ranging federal indictment that charged him withturning the investment banking house into a racketeering enterprise.   Milken, dressed in a navy blue, pinstriped suit entered his pleain a courtroom packed with more than 200 reporters, lawyers and thecurious.   Also entering innocent pleas before U.S. District Judge KimbaWood at federal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell,40. A third defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg wasabsent due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned at a laterdate.   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud andracketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.   Michael Milken entered the courtroom smiling and when Ms. Woodasked him how he felt, replied: ``O.K., your honor,'' promptinglaughter from the standing-room-only crowd.   Both Milkens were released without having to post bail afterAssistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defenselawyers had ``made substantial progress'' during talks to reach anacceptable bond for the defendants and their assets.   The charges seek $1.8 billion in forfeitures from each of thethree defendants, or their total combined earnings from 1984 to1987. The government reportedly had asked the three defendants eachto post a $1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on theirassets.   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationsact, assets found to be the result of racketeering activities aresubject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freezethe Milkens' assets to guarantee their availability in the event ofconviction.   If convicted, each of the three also face maximum fines of $3.7billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts.   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federalracketeering law _ that is, double the gains made from theallegedly illegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning, atCarroll's request, to finalize bond arrangements. The judge alsoscheduled Newberg's arraignment for April 25.   Milken, 42, following his indictment took a leave of absencefrom his job as head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-basedhigh-yield junk bond division, where he reportedly made more than$1 billion between 1983 and 1987.   Milken widely is considered a pioneer in making the low-gradesecurities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporatedeals.   The racketeering indictment followed a more than two-yearinvestigation of Wall Street's fifth-largest investment firm wastriggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculatorIvan Boesky.</TEXT></DOC>
