The body was to be handed over later to U.S. officials.   The Libyan military plane, a white Soviet-built Ilyushin with atiny green Libyan flag near one window, arrived at Rome's CiampinoAirport at 3:45 p.m.   The Libyan news agency JANA said Thursday that Libya wasreturning the body, but did not identify the pilot. However, JANAreported on Dec. 24 that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was offeringto return the body of Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of San Francisco.   Libya's gesture comes during increasing international debate overa suspected poison gas factory in Libya, and only nine days afterU.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan jets over the Mediterranean Sea.   JANA also has complained that a Libyan Airlines plane en routefrom Tripoli to Istanbul on Tuesday was buzzed over theMediterranean by U.S. fighter planes. The Pentagon said it had noknowledge of such an incident.   At the airport, a delegation including two Vatican officials andseveral Italian diplomats and air force officers met the plane. NoU.S. officials were present.   The white coffin, draped with an American flag and topped withwreaths of red and orange flowers, was carried off the rear sectionof the plane by the Italian air force officers in blue uniforms andLibyans in green fatigues.   The casket was set on the ground briefly before the air forceofficers tranferred it to a blue police mortuary van. The body wasto be taken to a morgue for identification.   One of the Vatican officials, Monsignor Francesco Mointerisi,said Italian officials would later turn over the body to theAmericans.   The Vatican said it was acting as an intermediary for``humanitarian reasons.'' Vatican sources said the Libyans firstapproached the Vatican around Dec. 15.   JANA said Thursday that: ``In the framework of the humanitarianinitiatives to which the Great Fatah September Revolution (Libyangovernment) devotes a fundamental interest, the body of the Americanpilot will be handed tomorrow, 13th January, to the representativeof the Vatican, representing His Holiness, the pope.''   Lorence and Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33, of Utuado, Puerto Rico,were in an F-111 that disappeared during the April 15, 1986, raidson Tripoli and Benghazi. Witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crashinto the Mediterranean soon after the plane being hit during theraid.   The other 17 U.S. Air Force bombers returned safely to theirbases after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities.   Three months after the 1986 U.S. attack, Libyan television showedpictures of a body it said was Lorence's. Libyan authorities havemade no mention of Ribas-Dominicci.   President Reagan said the attack was in retaliation for what hecalled Libya's support for international terrorism.   Libyan authorities said the raids killed about 40 people.   Gadhafi was quoted as saying in the Dec. 24 dispatch that he wasreturning the body ``especially since this occasion coincides withthe end of the rule of the Reagan administration.''   The move follows the Jan. 4 downing by U.S. jets of two Libyanplanes over the Mediterranean. U.S. authorities said the attack wasin self-defense, but Libya claimed the American craft launched a``premeditated'' attack.   The Libyan gesture also comes after Washington threatenedpossible military action against a nearly completed plant in Rabta,40 miles from Tripoli, that it says is intended for chemical weaponsproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
