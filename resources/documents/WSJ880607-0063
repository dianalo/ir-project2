Although details still are being worked out, it is clear that the proposed transaction Telemecanique revealed last week would be one of the biggest leveraged buy-outs ever in Europe and could top the 7.1 billion-franc ($1.22 billion) leveraged buy-out announced recently by France's Etablissements Darty andamp; Fils S.A.    Darty, France's leading distributor of household electrical goods and one of the blue-chip issues on the Paris stock exchange, announced its plan in April, seeking to thwart any hostile bidder. Darty's was Europe's second-biggest leveraged buy-out, after the #715 million ($1.3 billion) buy-out of MFI Furniture Group Ltd. of Britain last year.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is purchased by a small group of investors. The transaction is financed largely by debt.    Joe Hall, senior financial analyst at the stockbrokerage Bacot, Allain, Farra S.A., which isn't involved in the Darty transaction, calls Darty's plan an &quot;epoch-making decision and something that I'm sure is going to happen more and more in Europe.&quot; He says banks are &quot;falling over themselves&quot; to lend money to unlisted companies. &quot;So who needs a house full of shareholders and equity capital?&quot; he asks.    There has been speculation on the Paris exchange that France's Pernod-Ricard S.A. -- a liquor and soft-drinks group whose founding family is believed to be looking for a way to ensure the group's independence -- might be a candidate for a leveraged buy-out. Others recently rumored as candidates include Bouygues S.A., a construction and public-works group, and the vacation-village operator Club Mediterranee. Officials at all three companies deny having such intentions.    France caught the buy-out bug last year when a law was changed eliminating the need for prior government approval. Even now, French law imposes requirements that make buy-outs different here from those in the U.S.    For example, in France, managers and employees of a target company must control at least 51% of the holding company's voting rights. They have two weeks from the buy-out's launch to fulfill the 51% requirement. At least two people on the target company's payroll must participate, and no single person can hold more than 49% of the holding company's equity.    The bank Credit Lyonnais estimates that leveraged buy-outs totaling three billion francs were carried out in France last year, a tiny figure in comparison with the U.S., where 11 operations valued at more than $1 billion apiece took place. All told, more than 100 leveraged buy-outs took place in the U.S. last year.    But Credit Lyonnais is confident that the volume will expand quickly. The bank, which played an important role in Darty's leveraged buy-out, says the market for such operations will be boosted by companies jostling for position in the run-up to 1992, when the European Community plans to dismantle barriers to trade among its member countries. Moreover, more European companies are seeking to shed units that aren't closely related to their core businesses.    Renato Mazzolini, a partner at LBO France, which counsels companies on buyout techniques, says the attitude toward leveraged buy-outs in France is changing rapidly. &quot;When you said to a corporate chief executive a few years back that he could buy his company worth several billion francs, the usual response was, 'You're nuts!'&quot; he recalls. </TEXT></DOC>
