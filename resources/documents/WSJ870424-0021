LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported that first-quarter net income declined 30% from the depressed year-earlier level because of a charge for an early-retirement program and cost problems in combat aircraft programs.    The aerospace concern said earnings totaled $43 million, or $1.06 share, in the first period, down from $61.1 million, or $1.51 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales totaled $2.9 billion in both the 1987 and 1986 quarters.    McDonnell Douglas said it recorded a net charge of $37.6 million in the quarter to cover the costs of an early-retirement program at four units, including its combat aircraft operations.    The company also said earnings were hurt by cost increases and lower profit margins in its F-15 program, as well as higher research and development expenses associated with its bid to build the Advanced Tactical Fighter.    The company's year-earlier earnings were reduced by a pre-tax charge of $47.9 million associated with repairs to the AH64 Apache attack helicopter.    In the latest quarter, earnings of the company's commercial aircraft business declined, while results improved at its space systems and missile operations, its Information Systems Group and its McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit.    McDonnell Douglas said its firm backlog rose to $17.58 billion as of March 31, up from $16.56 billion a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
