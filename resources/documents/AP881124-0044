Warnings for heavy snow were in effect early today in mountainousareas of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Montana and Wyoming, theNational Weather Service said. Backcountry avalanche warnings werein effect in the Cascades in northern Oregon. Snow watches oradvisories were in effect in parts of North Dakota, Colorado andArizona.   Officials blamed icy roads for causing an accident on Interstate84 that killed one person at Ladd Canyon in east-central Oregon.   Up to 4 feet of snow piled up in the Sierra Nevada in NorthernCalifornia.   ``We are totally ecstatic,'' said Bill Jensen of the Squaw Valleyski resort near Lake Tahoe. ``This will be one of the best, if notthe best, Thanksgiving weekends we've ever had.''   The storm drenched lower elevations in California on Wednesday,then tapered off into showers and thundershowers.   Off Florida, Tropical Storm Keith moved toward Bermuda after itswinds and heavy rains swept across the Florida penisula withoutcausing major damage or casualties.   At 5 a.m. EST today, the storm packing 50 mph winds was centerednear 32.4 north latitude and 73.0 west longitude, or 490 miles westof Bermuda. It was moving east-northeast at nearly 40 mph.   Forecasters said that unless the storm changed direction or speedit would reach Bermuda by this afternoon.   Large sections of Florida shoreline were eroded in the Sarasotaand St. Petersburg Beach areas and on the island of Captiva in theGulf of Mexico.   Heavy winds and rain flipped over a truck in the Tampa Bay area.Tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged about 25 mobile homes in LakeCounty, in the state's midsection, and in Tampa, and flooding wasreported in low-lying areas in the storm's path.   Keith also was blamed for the derailment of 34 cars of a cargotrain Wednesday near Lakeland because of a railroad bed washed outby rain.   The derailment ruptured a natural gas line and forced theevacuation of 450 people from a square-mile area, but no injurieswere reported. Winds dissipated the gas, and residents returned totheir homes by late Wednesday, Polk County officials said.   Tampa, Orlando, Daytona and the Cape Canaveral area reported from5 to 6 inches of rain.</TEXT></DOC>
