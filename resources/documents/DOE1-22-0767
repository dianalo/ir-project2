These can be candidates for thedark matter of the universe. If we choose an additional Z' in the E/sub6/ gauge multiplet to couple to these neutrinos, but not ordinary leptons,we may also solve the solar neutrino problem, without violating knownexperimental bounds. The Z' must have a mass comparable to the ordinaryZ mass.</TEXT></DOC>
