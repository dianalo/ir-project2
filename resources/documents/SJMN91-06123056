But in San Jose,17.7 percent of the Medicare patients admitted to an acute care hospital diedwithin 180 days -- precisely the number predicted by the federal Health CareFinancing Administration's complicated mortality formula.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HIGH DEATH RATE FOR ELDERLY REPORTED IN STATE'SHOSPITALS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The city's public hospital, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, which hasbeen singled out for its high death rate in some past surveys, was not amongthe 161 hospitals that received that distinction this year.;    Hospitaladministrators long have criticized the federal mortality survey, noting thathospitals serving low-income urban populations usually perform worse thanhospitals in wealthier areas. Although some observers believe that poor peopledo receive lower-quality care, others argue that many inner-city patients waitlonger to go to the hospital and receive less care after they leave.;    &quot;Wetreat patients in an urban inner city, patients who are far sicker thanpatients who go to a suburban hospital might ever be,&quot; said Phyllis Brown, aspokeswoman for Highland General Hospital in Oakland, one of five South Bayand Alameda County hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates amongelderly patients admitted in 1989. The others were Community Hospital inMonterey, Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, and two Oakland facilities thathave since closed, Oakland Hospital and Peralta Hospital.;    Federalofficials, for their part, were careful about drawing conclusions Wednesday.;   J. Cari Elliott, a senior vice president for the Hospital Council ofNorthern and Central California, said the state may be a victim of its medicalfacilities' concerted effort to hold down hospital admissions and concentrateon outpatient care.;    Nationally, however, the statistics were less bleak.The study found a slight 4 percent decrease in the overall death rate ofMedicare patients hospitalized since 1985, Medicare chief Wilensky said. About1.1 million patients died in the year after their admission to a hospital,according to the latest federal figures.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BERT ROBINSON AND GREGORY SPEARS, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910502  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  362  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 2, 199100123056,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
