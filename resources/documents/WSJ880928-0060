L.P. were tendered under its offer to exchange the units for Apache Corp. stock.    Apache Corp. is trying to restructure the oil and gas limited partnership into a corporation. The company has said it wants to make the transition because low oil and gas prices have limited the partnership's ability to grow, because the partnership has relatively high overhead costs and because new tax laws that limit the deductibility of passive investments have made the partnership less attractive.    Apache Corp. offered holders of the units either 0.4 share of Apache for each unit held or stock in Key Production Co., a company that will own a proportionate amount of the partnership's properties. The restructuring requires approval of two-thirds of Apache Petroleum's 46.7 million units outstanding.    Apache said holders of the units have until Friday to vote on the restructuring. If it passes, holders who didn't tender their units will receive one Key share for each unit held. If two-thirds of the holders don't approve the change, the exchange offer will be completed and about 15 million Apache Petroleum units will still trade. </TEXT></DOC>
