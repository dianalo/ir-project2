Previously,population and agricultural data for CRRIS were tabulated on 1/2-degreesquare grid cells. This coarse resolution resulted in anomalies suchas population in water bodies, agricultural production in city centers,and nonconservation of population over the assessment grid. An even finermesh (2-minute square grid) is inadequate in densely populated citieswhere 20,000 or more people live in a square block. These difficultiesar overcome by a variable resolution technique using US Census Bureaupopulation data at the most detailed level available (enumeration districtsin cities or block groups in rural areas) and by excluding populationfrom unpopulated areas (e.g., large water bodies). Agricultural dataare available at only the county level and are apportioned to the assessmentgrid according to farm population. This paper discusses the populationdatabase construction using Tennessee as an illustration. 12 refs., 3figs.</TEXT></DOC>
