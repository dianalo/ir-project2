In 1986, profit from continuing operations was $181 million, or 64 cents a share. Vernon R. Loucks Jr., president and chief executive officer of the health-care concern, said 1987 profit will be affected by the transaction's one-time costs and the dilution from issuing shares to complete the acquisition. </TEXT></DOC>
